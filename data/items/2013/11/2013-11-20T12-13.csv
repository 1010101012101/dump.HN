The white/beige featureless walls with no human pictures in its field of view, the actors wearing extremely high contrast clothes, the incredible cinematography style smooth and even lighting... My real world experiences with the kinect on a 360 have been super aggravating and frankly I hate the GD thing.  Hey, all you need to do, is remodel and redecorate your home and buy new clothes...  No, instead I think, F microsoft, my plan will be to not buy another kinect instead, they need my money more than I need their aggravation.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, its really cool for about the first 15 minutes until it gets super aggravating.<p>As a disclaimer after the initial newness wore off I tend to use the 360 for living room youtube viewing (you need to disable kinect and voice recognition or miscues will drive you insane) and multi-player minecraft on the same screen at the same time is entertaining.

6767676,comment,6767386,6767562,2,0,antimagic,,,"Not to mention that using &#x27;self&#x27; in a block is just not a good idea to start with.  Conceptually a block is not a method, so it doesn&#x27;t have a well-defined self.  Instead we are relying on the lexical scope capturing of blocks.  The thing is, the documentation is very clear about what happens when you access self in a block[1]:
 &quot;When a block is copied, it creates strong references to object variables used within the block. If you use a block within the implementation of a method:<p><pre><code>    If you access an instance variable by reference, a strong reference is made to self;

    If you access an instance variable by value, a strong reference is made to the variable.&quot;
</code></pre>
Right.  So if you use self or an instance variable, you&#x27;ve just created a strong reference.  In Drew&#x27;s example, as he is relying on the object going out of scope, that will still leave the reference held by the block, which is itself held by the NotificationCenter.  As with all reference cycles, the way out is to get the NotificationCenter to stop observing that notification, or as the Apple documentation says, use a local variable that takes the value of self, and use that local variable inside the block.  This is the solution that Drew presents as Attempt6, but quite frankly would have been my very first attempt when the test failed.  The stuff about __block is a red-herring, and from the documentation goes in the opposite direction that Drew wants, forcing a strong reference rather than removing it.<p>Drew also gets bitten by NSAssert using self.  I would suggest that it is NSAssert that is doing something dodgy here - it&#x27;s trying to have an implicit self, as though it was a method, when it most definately isn&#x27;t a method - and Drew just got bitten by the impedence mismatch.  Macros - just say no.",1384951849

Maybe they even grep the data for my name.  But the consequences to me are better quality research on data-mining (because they sponsor some university research) and a diversion of my tax money to stuff I don&#x27;t want to fund.  (With a bit of industrial espionage, I guess, as shown by the old EU parliament report on ECHELON).<p>Looking at other abuses of data collection: I don&#x27;t like the way the UK police are building a massive DNA database.  I feel like that carries much more risk of harm to society, and to me, than GCHQ slurping data.  An idea DNA database for law enforcement would include everyone who has ever committed a crime, and no-one else.  But the UK database includes anyone who has ever been arrested.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if they go to trial and are found not guilty, or if they don&#x27;t even go to trial.  It also includes people who volunteer to be DNA sampled.  (EG, in prominent sex attack cases the local population sometimes volunteer to &quot;rule themselves out&quot;.  It&#x27;s bizarre.)<p>The criminal records database is also worrying.  Obviously we need it, but there have been plenty of examples of corrupt police officers selling information to the press.  It&#x27;s easy to imagine them selling information to ex-colleagues, or them mis-using the databse for personal use.  (Even with the protections in place.)<p>Local councils have weird powers to spy on subjects.  They use these powers to ensure that people applying for a parking permit actually live in that area, and are not just applying for the permit to sell on to other people.  Or they use the powers to spy on parents applying to a school, to ensure the parents live in the catchment area.  My local council has a bunch of employees who are abusive, nasty, idiots.  &quot;Little Hitlers&quot;, &quot;Jobsworths&quot;, etc.  Again, there are plenty of examples of corruption in local government.<p>With all of those people there are opportunities for the misuse of data and for corruption.  And they actually have an affect upon my life - credit ratings are wrong or I get harassed everytime I drive my car or I get refused something that rightfully I&#x27;m allowed or whatnot.  These everyday abuses that actually happen are more important to me than the theoretical risk of totalitarian government.",1384950747

For me, a &quot;fusion plant&quot; is a device that generates power. His machine, a Farnsworth fusor, should more appropriately be called a &quot;reactor&quot;, because it can only sustain a fusion reaction, but it cannot generate power. Building Farnsworth fusors is not too hard, given access to the right tools. 
Building fusion reactors that can be used as power plants, on the other hand, is an entirely different story. The design is a lot more complex, because plasmas don&#x27;t scale well and tend to get unstable as they get bigger.
For comparison:
A Farnsworth fusor can be built for around 1000 Euros, but it&#x27;s Q-value (=output_power/input_power) is so low that I have trouble even estimating it. Based on a quote of &quot;multiple hundreds of thousands of neutrons per seconds&quot; for describing a &quot;dangerous design&quot;, the fusion power is somewhere between a nanowatt and a microwatt, which makes the Q-value something like 10^-10.
For more complex fusion reactor designs based on magnetic confinement, the best Q-value that has been achieved so far was a value of 0.7 at the JET facility in the UK, 1997. A new reactor is currently being built in southern France. It is called &quot;ITER&quot;, and it is hoped that it can reach a Q-value of around 10. This is the type of Q-value that you need for a fusion power plant. ITER is projected to cost around 16 billion euros.",1384950068

As I have noted in the comments to my post, I agree that this is lower than the energy expended handling cash. However, and this is crucial, it is probably about 50MW higher than the cost of maintaining the ledger in a trust-based system that relies on the courts to maintain the integrity of the ledger.<p>I am all for running an electronic currency, but IMO the hash-rate protection feature of bitcoin is redundant and wasteful.<p>PS. If anyone reading this know the guys at blockchain.info can you ask them to update their site?

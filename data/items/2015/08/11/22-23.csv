Many years ago some people said that java would be faster than C, because it can optimize based on information learned at run-time, and there was even a microbenchmark or two to prove it (against naive c of course). They also said that Itanium&#x27;s crazy VLIW architecture would allow compilers to make more efficient use of processor resources than hardware out-of-order instruction schedulers could. It&#x27;s been a decade since the height of java and Itanium, and the results speak for themselves.<p>This popcount thing is a great example. All your layers of abstraction didn&#x27;t save you from a bug in the lowest layer! (Granted, the only result is some inefficiency, and we sacrifice that all the time.)

It doesn&#x27;t say that the First Amendment does not provide Constitutional rights to non-natural persons, only that if it is construed to provide such rights, those rights cannot be construed as unalienable.<p>This is sort of odd language; and its not really clear what it means. The most likely interpretation I see is that it reduces potential intrusions on First Amendment rights of non-natural persons from the kinds of things judged under strict scrutiny (usually referred to as &quot;fundamental&quot; rather than &quot;unalienable&quot;, though the terms are closely related in their general meaning and this seems to the most natural mechanism of giving effect to the language in the proposed amendment), even when the restrictions are not content-neutral; this would <i>probably</i> leave both content-specific and content-neutral regulation of speech that impacted only the rights of non-natural persons subject to intermediate scrutiny, but that&#x27;s not entirely clear (and it would certainly lead to natural persons asserting that <i>their</i> rights were impinged by the restriction on the non-natural person that they control.)<p>> removing ALL free speech protections for people who are channeling their speech through any kind of resource aggregation is an insane overreaction.<p>But it certainly doesn&#x27;t do that. If a natural person has a free speech interested affected by a law, the fact that they are channeling their speech through some mechanism of &quot;resource aggregation&quot; wouldn&#x27;t prevent them from asserting their <i>own</i> First Amendment right, even if the amendment (as it does not) stripped <i>all</i> First Amendment protection from non-natural persons.",1439333676

10044906,comment,10043799,10044797,0,0,vlad,,,"Thanks for your brave submission, and going first. :)  Here&#x27;s what I have so far, as a &quot;transcript.&quot;<p>1) First instinct: The fact it&#x27;s an iPhone app and for weight loss, I got the vibe I have to spend time (do work) to compare how it&#x27;s different from what&#x27;s out there.  I also don&#x27;t realize what I would even search for to find competitors.<p>In other words, I didn&#x27;t think “it’s a tool to help me lose weight” like an iPhone or a frying pan are clearly tools.  Instead, I thought, it’s one of thousands of apps I have to compare and learn, a bummer.<p>2) Therefore, create some layouts (screens) that make the user feel they already know how they’ll use it and why before they even download it (regardless of what else exists).  You know how to use a water pitcher, refrigerator, or even a digital piano (press on/off, push any key to make sound).  Yes, there might be a learning curve to become an expert with tools (e.g. piano) but it’s clear what you’ll be doing with it.<p>3) Maybe you need one big screenshot on top of the page, a simple screen that simply shows a smooth graph based on the health kit weight data.  And the explanation “install to visualize your data instantly, your info stays private on your device”.  And a big Install now button.  Nothing to learn.  That might be worth $0.99 (or more) on its own.<p>And then of course you have the other stuff that people can explore and learn over time.<p>4) I like the “track multiple family members” screen because I let multiple users create profiles in my desktop software, too.  I’m worried nobody really cares to share their weight data with a friend.<p>5) I would survey users to find out what their favorite parts of the app are, and what one feature makes them come back.  Or what one feature they would miss if they lost it.  Maybe that feature should have its own screen.<p>6) Another reason that people tend to trust simple screens is because they make the product look like “there’s less to break” to bugs, and a higher chance it will still work on their next phone, so it’s worth buying.<p>7) My reaction was, the benefits or features at the top of your page are hard to understand.  The last sentence of the paragraph is the only one that actually describes what the app might do or how it benefits you.  Also, Tame the Scale seems like the app name, not Happy Scale.<p>And the last sentence doesn’t go far enough.  The real benefit is, &quot;see your real weight trend, instantly, to stay motivated”, not to see trends.  Or to control their emotions rather than being a &quot;yoyo&quot; that feels &quot;I&#x27;m losing weight, I&#x27;m gaining weight&quot; every other day.  Stay motivated, confident, and consistent.<p>With that simple screenshot and text at the top of the page, that should be an awesome way to get people to take the initial action of installing the app (at the end of the day, you want people to install it, not read your site!)",1439332936

I&#x27;ve written counter-points to that in the past. I referenced MKULTRA&#x27;s, others the stay-behind armies (eg Gladio), and most recently programs with at least a few hundred people where only around four (esp Snowden) talked. Others have the information get out through third parties (esp reporters) while getting no coverage in or smeared by media. Recently, we&#x27;ve seen that whistleblowing on executive is itself treated like a crime.<p>So, it&#x27;s clear that the more dangerous and professional of the military/intelligence/LEO community can effectively keep secrets or do damage control. They have plenty successes for every screwup. Dare I say that all the people with clearances vs number of damaging leaks show their method works well enough if only because of good people participating.<p>So, transparency, whistleblower protection, and strong accountability (esp w/ GAO) are absolutely essential. Further, anyone hiding information in one of these investigations should be, if this is proven, hit with life in a harsh prison immediately. Further, a plan of action to split the media from CIA, etc influence needs to be formed and implemented. It will take such a strong combo to discourage the corruption we&#x27;ve seen for decades.<p>But first Americans have to give a shit enough to act. I&#x27;ve seen very little of that.

From an a priori standpoint (and I am happy to accept a posteriori arguments, i.e. studies), people will on average invest a fixed percentage of their income into long-term savings (i.e. pension) and the rest on various goods. I read your &quot;people do not accumulate wealth&quot; as a general agreement to that premise. But <i>if that&#x27;s the case</i>, then there really is nothing bad going on here. Your total spending power is independent of whether you buy one large good A, or instead a series of smaller goods B that sum to A.<p>The latter is, what I interpret as your &quot;increase in velocity of spending&quot;. But that has no negative impact on you as a customer, whereas it is good for the economy, no? Because money that is churned in the economic cycle produces wealth, whereas money standing still doesn&#x27;t.<p>And that&#x27;s what I mean by my alternatives: Either my premise is true, in which case your total spending power won&#x27;t really change and advertising only redistributes this spending power amongst several competing companies. Or my premise is false, in which case advertising would cause us to sacrifice long-term savings in pensions for short term satisfaction for buying goods (which might be bad).<p>But I see no reason, a priori, why that premise should be false. It actually sounds pretty ridiculous to me, tbh.<p>Overall, my (very limited) understanding of economics for this problem is based on two rough fundamental principles: a) The amount of value (≈ money after accounting for inflation) in the economy is more or less constant (i.e. people have more or less &quot;money you need to afford food and shelter&quot;xC, where C is a constant). And b) Money produces wealth, when it is spent (i.e. is exchanged for goods).",1439331010

After much discussion, Opal&#x27;s founder said they would adopt a code of conduct, specifically the Contributor Covenant. Once people in favor of the Contributor Covenant realized it would do nothing to prevent what they perceived as harassment, they added that clause.

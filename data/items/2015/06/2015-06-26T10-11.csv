Recognizing one particular repository as canonical is a feature, not a bug. As much as git itself doesn&#x27;t place any special significance on a particular repository, the culture of open source development does. Linus Torvalds can certainly say that his Linux repository doesn&#x27;t hold special status, but that&#x27;s just not true beyond a technical level. It&#x27;s useful to be able to say &quot;this is the <i>main</i>, supported version of this library&quot;",1435316376

Also, prematurely paying off your mortgage might have punishing penalties, and also there are frictional costs to selling.<p>You cannot always necessarily rent to others.  You may have strata / HOA rules that prevent renting.<p>Buying with cash has an opportunity cost on your money.  A mortgage is renting money.  Whether you rent a home or you rent money, either way you&#x27;re paying rent.  You also have other &quot;lost money&quot; costs as an owner: maintenance costs (and labour), property taxes, possibly condo fees, etc.  So when you consider the &quot;losing money&quot; aspect of owning, you&#x27;re losing the interest payments, and you&#x27;re losing some other fees... but the part of your mortgage payment that is excess of interest is not lost money (it&#x27;s savings).<p>On other other hand, there are advantages to owning.  In particular, if you want to make a highly leveraged wager (5x being common), you can do that in real estate.  If you win at the wager, you can win a lot of money.  (Of course a casino lets you win a lot of money too, with extreme leverage, but the housing market has no &quot;house&quot; extracting a vig, pun not intended).  Also, many countries have tax incentives for ownership.  For example, US effective interest rates are somewhat lower than the contractual rate, because the government gives you some of it back at tax time (I think.... I&#x27;m not an ardent student of the US housing rules).<p>In short, a statement like &quot;you&#x27;ve always got options as an owner&quot; or &quot;renting is losing while buying is an investment&quot; is so oversimplified as to be incredibly damaging.<p>The math is tractable for a modestly smart person, but it does take some dedication.",1435315432

The key novel idea in ROP is to use data in unintended ways. This is based on the insight that the memory often contains short sequences of bytes (e.g. a .jpg image) that can be interpreted as machine instructions. For example an mp3 file might contain the sequence 99 19933, 16 which translates to<p><pre><code>    increment register 16
    return
</code></pre>
in the ambient machine language. Call that &quot;dual use data&quot;.
ROP searches the memory for sufficient &quot;dual use data&quot; and then builds an ac-hoc compiler with &quot;dual use data&quot; as target language. Then the attack software compiles to &quot;dual use data&quot; and then runs the compiled code.<p>Of course one may ask: can we always find enough &quot;dual use data&quot; to build a Turing-complete set of instructions as a compilation target.

Or at least there will not be enough somebodies.<p>This comes up again and again (not just in Slovenia, but in any country that has an inter-generational pension system).<p>There are two points to make here:<p>One is that as long as a country produces enough goods and services, money is &quot;just&quot; a tool for allocating these goods and services. How money is being saved and spent has already changed massively; countries have a different tax structure, require people to spend <i>vastly</i> more on health insurance than a century ago, families are smaller compared to a century ago and parents are less dependent on their children in old age (and thus the way our retirement works now is already vastly different from back then). There&#x27;s little reason to think that the system cannot adapt. This is not to say that it &quot;will&quot; (because, well, predictions are hard, especially about the future), but it would also be unrealistic to assume that what we are going to have 30-50 years from now will be like what we have now. Heck, we don&#x27;t even know if the &quot;lump of labor fallacy&quot; will still be a fallacy in a future of rising automation or whether part-time work will become the norm. At which point all bets are off, anyway.<p>As a simple example, we could just implement a basic level of pensions through taxes (in lieu of existing pension schemes) that people could increase through private pension schemes. This is essentially basic income minus the moral hazard (because you don&#x27;t have to worry about creating a disincentive to work for people outside the labor force).<p>The second point is that investing privately in your retirement does not fundamentally change anything. When a society ages and has a disproportionate amount of young people, these young people still need to generate enough economic output, regardless of whether the income for those too old to contribute comes out of interest payments, an inter-generational scheme, taxes, or something else.",1435313674

Thanks to the v² scaling of energy that has to be dissipated, even a 20mph impact exceeds the design limits of a cycle helmet to absorb impact energy by nearly a factor of 3 which means that helmets make little difference in direct collisions with vehicles travelling at normal traffic speeds.

It&#x27;s a good base for employer and/or government contribution match schemes. It has obvious and fair inheritance implications (if you die at 64, who gets your pension?). It&#x27;s far safer, with much less risk that the money will be gone when you retire. The systemic risk aspect is much better too.<p>The alternative is pension schemes, alarmingly similar to pyramid schemes. The company (or however it is centralized) pays out of current income, IE current employees or tax payers pay for old pension obligations. This works until it doesn&#x27;t. If people start living longer, the company/tax base shrinks or no one bothered to do the sums 30 years ago, it collapses.<p>The reason pension schemes are so common is because it&#x27;s easier to start a pension scheme and very hard to move from the pension scheme to a superannuation scheme.<p>When you start a pension shceme, the costs are very low at first while the number of retirees is low. You can pay out pensioners starting now. Superannuation only hits full speed once people have contributed to it for a lifetime start to retire. Way way longer then the horizon of CEOs, politicians or union bosses.<p>If you try to move from pensions to superannuations, you are in a problem.

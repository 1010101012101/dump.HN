Even being aware of your fears seems to be quite rare. Let alone be commited to facing them instead of making up alibis and creating their own state of limbo.<p>Recently, I have starting 'fighting' my fears by noticing them in the first place (""Why dont I call X/do Y/commit to Z""), then by asking myself: ""Why am I fearing X?"". Most of the times it is some irrational thought about rejection, failure, lack of money, even success (""If I do it, I'm commited and dont have time for all the other things I'm afraid to do""). It's all bullcrap. 9 out of 10 times, when you do the thing you fear, it does not pan out the way you imagined, and the other time it teaches you something invaluable. I'm starting to think that by framing every thought you have in the most positive way and by closing your mind from negative influences from others AND YOURSELF, you can conquer any fear. I think this is closely related to the authors point: your self-worth should have nothing to do with what other people think of you and/or how your enterprises turn out. You and you alone control your mind/thoughts, and therefor your happiness. If you fearlessly and with 'passion' do the things that you think are right, make and learn from mistakes, truly believe in and commit to your goal, then congratulate yourself. You're already doing more than almost all of the people I know.",1325159851

For one, ""searching"" involves finding out whether there is <i>anybody</i> who can provide <i>any</i> goods, not whether there is a supplier who can give you as much product as you need. You cannot find a supplier in China to build you more used Aeron chairs. Apple and Amazon have wildly different options in that area.<p>Secondly, ""inspecting"" may boil down to a similar process of QA, but I think it should be obvious that assuring quality in a production process of new goods is a very straightforward thing while for used goods, you probably need a new process with every supplier you find.<p>And I agree that there is an astonishing growth in optimizing any kind of operations process. However, that still doesn't increase supply. This cuts back to his main argument: ""grow revenue without costs growing proportionally"". If you have a finite supply of used Aeron chairs, acquisition of the remaining chairs becomes increasingly hard - up until the point where there aren't any, anymore.<p>So yes, I added the argument of finite (if only temporary) supply, but it was only to extend his argument of proportional growth of cost. And yes, there is room for optimization and that may be sufficient to keep a business afloat - certainly if they are flexible with their inventory - but there are still natural limits to such a business, and that makes all the difference in the world.",1325158532

GoDaddy's support is in Arizona, clear, well trained, and answer the phone quickly, 24x7. Admittedly, I don't reedit often, but good/fast/easy support is important, and can be vital. I am not sold that the support will be acceptable with the others. I desperately want to move away from goDaddy, but don't know where to go <i>to</i>!",1325156916

I still can't find the options to do that, after clicking around like crazy. Unless you mean the person by person ""all/most/only important"" - that's far too much hassle.<p>In Google+ I've toned down the number of updates from my ""following"" circle that I use for people I don't personally know, for example, and I don't have to remember to adjust settings for individual people when I add them to that circle. Meanwhile, if I want to see that unfiltered stream, I only need to click on that circle, not on each individual member of it.<p>> Also, have you tried managing a page with Google+ yet?

None of my clients ever redistributed their software, most likely because they considered it a competitive advantage. Think about it for a moment and you'll realize it's not a big problem. For me, it's an advantage, because I could reuse the code I did in other projects, something I wouldn't be able to do if I didn't license the code under the GPL in the first place.<p>> Stallman doesn't want you to be able to charge for software<p>No. What he doesn't want is that programmers are able to restrict freedoms of their users. BSD allows that. GPL forbids that.<p>In other words, he fights for the users. ;-)",1325156775

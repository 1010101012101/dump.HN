I'm a pretty creative person and I hate to box myself in by saying ""Never do it this way"", especially when some very smart people have advocated both/multiple ways. I suggest taking a risk-analysis approach towards estimating as well whereupon you figure out what the mean time to complete, best, and worst times. This can give you confidence (after you've done it awhile) in your guesstimates and that confidence allows you to move more into the value-based pricing. I definitely wouldn't suggest value-based pricing for someone who had not had loads of time-based pricing experience.",1210085979

If you choose to sell your services to small businesses, be prepared to fit into a reality where the client thinks $80 an hour is a terribly high amount for a 5-10 hour job, and is prepared to just not have the work done instead.  Very little is actually required for most small businesses; some of them are still considering upgrading the old machine running Win98 that's been doing invoices for 10 years, and unless it breaks, it's ""good enough"".",1210085924

""Something"" doesn't always equal coding - it could be meetings, setting stuff up, responding to e-mails, etc. For any given hour you bill, just ask yourself ""If a contractor charged me for this hour of activity, would it make me - as a customer - freak out?""

182489,comment,182369,182400,0,0,edw519,,,"Network, network, network, network, network!  (Sorry, I cannot overemphasize this.)  <i>You</i> are your own marketing department.  All the time.  No, you don't have to be one of those Amway pests, but don't be afraid to say what you do and to volunteer your opinion about something computer related.  You're not doing it to get business; you're doing it because that's who you are.  Even if nothing happens now, it could 6 months later.  You never stop networking, no matter how busy you are now.<p>A few examples:<p>- Hung out with the same guy at Tuesday night Bible study for 3 years.  One day he said, ""I heard you tell someone you know something about computers.  My company needs software for our factory.  Do you know anything about that?""  Turned into 50K over the next 6 months.<p>- Went to an industry dinner/speaker event.  The stranger next to me asked what I did.  I told him.  He asked if I ever did <xyz>.  Before I could answer, my partner joked, ""That's how we made our first million.""  The stranger said, ""How'd you like to make your second million?""  We talked all night and started work 2 days later.  20K in 2 months.  All from a joke.<p>- A contractor friend got a great full time job.  She asked me to ""take over"" her maintenance accounts (3 of them).  Many thousands part time over the next 3 years.<p>- Had another friend who I met for lunch once a month for years.  She always talked about her job.  One day, she suddenly had to move out of state for personal reasons.  I emailed her employer, telling what I did (which was exactly what they had her doing).  Turned into 4 years of work.<p>- Met my aunt's next door neighbor while sitting on her porch.  My aunt said, ""Eddie's into computers.""  He said he had a friend who owned a pawn shop with a computer running Windows that ""froze"" every day at 3:00, their busiest hour.  He was going nuts.  (Licking my chops), I said I could look into it.  A 6 month gig with all new cool software (not Windows).<p>- Went to a Monday Night Football party.  A friend of a friend who owned a small distribution company said the bank wouldn't lend them any more money until they computerized their inventory.  After 3 months of me (for $20K), they were able to borrow $300K.  Pretty good deal for everyone.<p>- A friend was offered a 6 month gig in Detroit for $60/hour.  He didn't want to move to Detroit.  I took it.  Got an efficiency for $400/month, drove my own car there, and dialed in to my other clients.  6 months later, moved home.  Not a bad deal.<p>- Had another friend who owned a small software house.  (Didn't know it until I knew him for over a year).  He coded everything with linked lists because he didn't know anything about databases.  I converted all his software to DBMS over a 6 month period.  Again, everyone happy.<p>I could go on and on, but you kinda get the picture.  And I haven't even touched on the web stuff.<p>The demand still far outweighs the supply for good software.  If you know what you're doing (a big assumption), there's millions of people who need what you do.  So get out there and talk to them!",1210085323

182473,comment,182339,182372,0,0,msg,,,"I'd say that the algorithms are key in AI, not necessarily the language. You can program neural networks, genetic algorithms, search in Blub.<p>The early AI programs tended to solve toy problems. No one had thought much then about the implications of the curse of dimensionality: that each entity you add to the problem (say, throw another object into your object-manipulating robot's environment) increases the problem space exponentially (or even factorially).<p>But you're right, there has been a ton of progress in AI. The initial bias toward ontologies, expert systems, and top-down algorithms has given way to bottom-up systems that are data-driven rather than abstraction-driven.<p>One major example is using neural networks, SVMs, RBFs to discover implicit features in a data set rather than depending on an expert to code up those features explicitly. Experts don't scale, but data will always be with us. Thus we've seen increasing interest in information retrieval as opposed to ontological knowledge engineering.<p>But a lot is going on in the field even today.

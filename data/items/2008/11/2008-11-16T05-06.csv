They do, however, make more than I do.<p>As for ""well give it out anyway, they could always sell it"" I refer to the point of ""becomes the company we envisaged"" and what happened to craigslist.<p>I never said our model was common.

I find cube life very depressing and am increasingly losing my motivation.<p>I have better social interaction, though. My work has people who are hard to converse with because of their lack of social skills but the majority of people aren't like that.<p>Even though I hate sitting in my cubicle all day, I really don't like most meetings because the information discussed isn't interesting and my eyes glaze over. People get into pointless arguments and I sit there hoping for the meeting to end. The only meetings that I like are design meetings, but most of our meetings just cover status updates.<p>I yearn for a job that doesn't involve sitting in front of a computer all day. I love hardware design and programming, but 8 hours a day of it is very taxing. I suffer from RSI in my wrists and have yet to find a long lasting remedy.<p>Maybe the best option would be to start my own hardware or software company. Working for someone else just adds to the dreariness. Other than that, I have been thinking about becoming a doctor.",1226814339

365806,comment,365526,365526,0,0,jmtame,,,"I'm a technical guy, but I don't think this has to be a polarized debate.  I think business founders might have a few roles to play early in the startup:<p>1) Hire new talent
2) Raise capital
3) Handle day to day things (frees the technical co-founder from much of the time-intensive due diligence)<p>The business guy cannot conduct technical interviews, however.  He also needs to be extremely reliable if he's negotiating term sheets.  And he needs to stay active with business development stuff, probably leave it to the CTO to manage the technical people.<p>Maybe it's possible to have both business and tech people, but I do agree that it's best to have more technical people early on.  After all, how do you forge business relationships without a product?  I would say if anything, the business guy should be responsible for going out and pitching every day.  Get those business terms down to a tee, and make it a goal to have many high-quality and interested investors.  That is something that itself can take up all of a technical founders' time.<p>I met with one of the guys who started and sold EUNet (one of Europe's larger ISPs).  He said ""you know what makes a really good executive?  It's the people who know to do the right things.  Leave it to the middle-level managers and product developers to know how to do things right.""  Perhaps one of the goals of a business co-founder is to be absolutely sure about the market and the idea, or to always challenge it.  Someone has to ask ""are the engineers building something people want?""  Most of the time, engineers are building something cool to them.  And they're usually eager to work on challenging things.  But is it something people want?  I would say you're very lucky if the technical co-founder has this type of aptitude.  I can only think of a few who do.  Levchin has it, Zuckerberg has it, Gates and Jobs (Jobs being arguably less technical, but extremely product-driven) both have it too.  Those are difficult people to find.",1226813979

365804,comment,365770,365770,0,0,time_management,,,"The problem's not that they're a shallow generation. Actually, I think the Baby Boomers were a very idealistic generation, and this (paradoxically) has led to the corrupt leadership. The civil rights activists, hippies, and leftists (with a few exceptions) didn't swing around to become the yuppies, sellouts, and corrupt political figures. Different people did.<p>My father's pretty similar to me in worldview, ethics, and politics. When he was growing up, he couldn't have even imagined working at a hedge fund; the concept of working for money was considered crass, if not repulsive. (He was actually quite incensed when I first said I was interested in trying out trading.) In 2007, it was perfectly normal for a liberal, idealistic young person to go and work for an investment bank or hedge fund, because that was seen as the best way to establish oneself and go far later (e.g. Jeff Bezos worked at Shaw before founding Amazon).<p>I would note that the problem with the Baby Boom generation isn't that they're ""selfish"". My parents aren't bad people. Nor were most of my teachers; they were great. On the whole, the Boomers aren't worse than the rest of us. The difference between them and us is that the better half of them almost entirely eschewed the career paths that led to power-- finance and corporate leadership-- leaving the shameless and greedy bastards to take control.",1226813608

365802,comment,365637,365790,0,0,alaithea,,,"I also work on a quasi-agile team. We do pair programming, but we often get assigned to the same pair for weeks or months at a time. It's sort of like being in an arranged marriage. I've told management time and again that this doesn't turn out well, to no avail.<p>Granted, pair programming does offer interaction. The hours go more quickly while pairing. However, I often prefer to work alone when I can, so that I can have some semblance of privacy and personal space in our bull-pen work environment.<p>I have to say that the recent financial turmoil and U.S. election have lead the conversation away from D&D, the latest video game, or the plots of Star Trek episodes. It has been a welcome change of pace.  We have dumb jokes, too. The puns, ohhh the puns. ;)",1226813531
365801,comment,365293,365293,0,0,jrockway,,,"Some advice that hasn't been mentioned yet: make sure your publisher supports you.  Writing a book is difficult and you want to spend your time on the content -- not making sure that there are no typos, teaching the publishers how to run the code, doing the layout, maintaining different versions of the book, etc.<p>I recently wrote a book, and I got very little support from the publisher.  It was a disaster, although I didn't realize that until after publication.  I was the first person to write a Perl book for them, and they had nobody on staff that could even install Perl.  The editors didn't do any significant editing, and in fact weren't even native speakers of English.  They didn't even manage to publish the right version of some chapters.  When they made the code from the book available, they did so as a word document containing code snippets from the book (instead of the runnable tarballs from each example and chapter that I provided for them).<p>Basically, your name goes on the book, so any fuck-up will be attributed to you.  If something goes wrong, like things did with my book, you will get hate mail every day, criticizing you for things that you had no control over.<p>Oh yeah, and when the code you wrote the book about goes out of date, people will send you hate mail for that too.  It is also apparently a hobby of people to nit-pick things like your variable names (""OMG you used $c instead of $ctx, YOU ARE SO DUMB!"").  I'm not sure what motivates people to send me e-mail about things like this.  Do they I think I care what they think?  Do they want me to magically change every copy of the book?  I don't get it.<p>In case you haven't noticed, the experience has changed my life.  Before writing the book, I was really excited about open source projects and talking to people.   I genuinely wanted to help people learn to program better.  Now I am bitter and misanthropic because of the constant influx of hate mail.  (I could go on and on about this, how people don't want to learn, how teaching is a waste of time, etc., etc... but I will save that for another day.)<p>I'm not trying to talk you out of writing a book, of course, but just make sure that your publisher cares about your book.  If they don't, you may regret writing it.",1226813492

905316,comment,904941,905246,0,0,megamark16,,,"I'll second that.  The whole point of the internet (at least as I see it) of linking relevant documents together is pretty much lost when those links are fragile shortened urls.  Maybe if there was a markup, similar to the img alt tag, that allowed you to say ""Here's the short one, if that doesn't work, here's the full one"".<p>The real issue, as I see it, is that people solved the wrong problem.  I see this a lot at my new job, where they created bigger problems for themselves by asking the wrong questions and therefor solving the wrong problem.  Isn't the main reason people use shortened URLs so that they can link to things on sites like Twitter where every character counts?  If that is the case then the real problem isn't that URLs are too long, it's that Twitter counts them against you, instead of allowing people to put actual hyperlinks (you know, <a href=""xyz"">Title</a>) in their tweets.  If the only part that counted against your character count was the Title section then we wouldn't have this problem.  They could even simplify the markup somehow to make it more user friendly then actual HTML.<p>If I've misunderstood the problem that URL shorteners are trying to solve then I apologize for my off the mark rant.<p>Thanks

Of course, subscribing to a high-traffic feed isn't much more effective than just keeping a tab open and refreshing every few seconds. You still have to cut throught the noise.

You're not alone.<p>Rule 1: <i>Get all compensation and consideration in writing.</i> Even if you think the people on the ""other side of the table"" are trustworthy, you could face an entirely different set of people when the contract actually matters.<p>When did you sign over the IP? The absolute <i>latest</i> time to get your compensation (including what happens to your equity if you leave or get fired) locked down is when you assign the IP. If you've never signed over the IP, this is good news but you must talk to an attorney right now.<p>Rule 2: If you have any documentation, the court system is your friend. If there's a substantial amount of money involved, and it sounds like there was in the context of the acquisition, an attorney will take your case on contingency. Trust me: this is more common than you think.<p>You absolutely must get at least a settlement out of this. Being beaten down at a previous job makes it hard to keep on an even keel, emotionally speaking, at the next one. Even if the money means absolutely nothing to you, you must fight.<p>There are good startups and good founders out there. You just fell in with one of the bad ones. The good founders will set fair contracts (not just golden-road promises) in advance. Talk is cheap. It's easy to make someone ""feel like"" a real co-founder but it's hard to actually show that the person is one.",1315147941

And reading HN has been therapeutic to say the least! My interaction with the community is primarily passive - I hardly comment on anything. But just reading the posts and comments - it gives me back makes me think, that its not only me. I've become aware that I do too much stupid shit that are tangential to the main project (just for the fun of it) - I was overdoing it to the point of not completing anything and trying to make everything perfect. I'm trying to change all that - but over the past year, I've stopped communicating with my old real world (brilliant & never-failing) friends - just to avoid embarrassment. I now seek new groups (online) who would never judge me (doesn't this emphasize the terribly important use case for a pseudonym feature? lulz :D) ...

Good code is readable and correct.<p>The first time you encounter a problem, your first idea of how to solve it will be awful. This is true no matter how long you spend thinking about it, no matter how much experience you have. The best workflow involves thinking, then coding, then thinking, then throwing away most of your code and doing it better. You can't find the flaws in an implementation while its in your head - you need to see it on the screen before you can fix it. Your second implementation will generally be better. The best code I've written I've iterated on 3-4 times until it looks simple and obvious.<p>Unit tests will help you iterate - write them before / just after your first attempt at the code. Then when you rewrite the code you'll have confidence that you haven't broken it.<p>You're not writing poetry. Sometimes your code is hard to read because you're doing a simple thing in a complex way. Other times your code is hard to read because its algorithmically complicated. In the second case, spreading the algorithm out over lots of places will make it almost impossible to understand. So, don't stress out when you can't make your code into a haiku. Sometimes you can't - but you should try anyway.<p>The best way to learn what good and bad code looks like is to read code. At first, reading code will be harder than writing it. You should do it anyway. Your own code is ok, but other people's code is better. Pick an opensource library you use and try and figure out how you would write it. Then read the code and see how they did it. Their method might be worse than yours. - But remember, their project is successful anyway.",1315146383

Do you think any of those four people had any grease to make demands on whether or not a product should include, or even be based upon conventions that would assist those with disabilities if said inclusion were to set back the shipping timetable? I think not.<p>tl;dr: CEO's focus on sales and revenue, HR is a rubber stamp/sick day tracker, which can be outsourced.",1315145873

2959415,comment,2957174,2958879,2,0,sharkbot,,,"You seem to be using obfuscatory wording to avoid the issue. We have evidence that physical brains are not just correlated with consciousness, they are the cause. Anesthetic is probably the best example; once you've administered anesthetic to a brain, consciousness is lost, while removing it restores consciousness. There is no continuity under anesthetic, the time is just 'skipped'.<p>A simple book that will help you get it, is ""How the Mind Works"" by Steven Pinker. Science assumes that consciousness depends on the brain, since that assumption explains the observations. What's more, we take assumptions for facts once we have enough consistent observations to overcome the biases of reasonable people.",1315145704

If I remember correctly, HtDP was partly inspired by the big chunk of SICP that requires somewhat external domain knowledge (mostly calculus and some electrical engineering), and the authors wanted to write an intro CS book that didn't require any special prerequisites. They were also written in different times, for different audiences. Didn't MIT combine their CS and EE curriculums as ""course 6"" (and still do?) requiring someone who was ostensibly majoring in CS to do a lot of EE, physics, and calc? I imagine CS was a different kind of major in the 80s when SICP was first written than it was when HtDP was first conceived.<p>I tried to read it, after having read SICP, but I couldn't get past two or three chapters. It's very much geared toward a complete beginner to programming and goes quite slowly, with tons of hand holding examples. This isn't really a fault, they obviously cannot satisfy a complete beginner and a working programmer with a CS degree who wants to fill in holes in their knowledge. I'd like to try to go at it again, maybe after they finish updating it, perhaps doing what Norman Ramsey has said on Stack Overflow in recommendations of the book: ""If it's too easy, go faster!"". There's a review on Amazon from someone who claims to have a PhD in CS, who said it was very valuable. (maybe that says something about their PhD program? zing! I jest.) So take my review with a dose of salt.",1315145474
2959412,comment,2958528,2958528,2,0,philwelch,,,"This seems plausible to me. I'm not a physicist, but I think the case of dark matter can be compared to the case of the planet Vulcan.<p>In the early 20th century, in the heyday of discovering planets by observing existing planets and realizing that classical mechanics didn't quite predict their orbits correctly, it was observed that Mercury's orbit didn't fit the classical model well enough. Reasonably enough, it was presumed that there was another planet orbiting inside of Mercury's orbit. This planet was dubbed ""Vulcan"", and the fact that no one had ever observed Vulcan was explained away by the fact that it was clearly too close to the sun to be observed. This was all well and good until the early heyday of Einstein's theories, which made small but crucial changes to the mathematical models of classical mechanics. The orbit of Mercury was found to be perfectly consistent with Einstein's model.<p>The question of dark matter supposes a dichotomy: either our current understanding of physics is essentially accurate and there's a ton of fundamentally unobservable matter in the universe that explains any anomalous observations, or our model of physics isn't quite right yet. Intuitively, I think it's more likely our physics are off.",1315145458

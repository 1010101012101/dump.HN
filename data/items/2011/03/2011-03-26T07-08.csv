2371617,comment,2371527,2371527,1,0,wyclif,,,"If you're really starting from zero, I'd recommend Python. The first book I'd recommend would be Zed Shaw's <i>Learning Python the Hard Way.</i> Again, this is for a raw beginner; if you've already written some rudimentary code and know how to use a text editor, the first half of the book will drive you crazy because of the drilling. If you can skip to the end of that book and you're not challenged, try <i>How To Think Like a Computer Scientist</i> (the Python edition). Both of these books are free online.<p>This question (or a variation of it) has been asked before on Ask HN, so do a search and read those archived posts.<p>My best advice is to get some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript under your belt. That will give you a good foundation. Then move on to a good, dynamic functional language like Python or Ruby.",1301126350

And I also bet that the availability of localized strings (i.e. ""Is string 8230 available in language X?"") affects what options are shown to the user.  After all, if a descriptive string isn't available in the user's current language, how do you show them the option?<p>So what exactly happened?  I don't know.  Maybe they whacked some part of a localization table.  Or rolled back to a previous localization table.  Or mangled mappings from ""language"" to ""current localization table"".

If a Facebook user finds a social network that's better than Facebook, tough luck. The value of Facebook is that their friends are on it so they can't switch to another social network. If a Windows user discovers an operating system that's better than Windows, tough luck if you rely on any applications that only run on Windows. If a Google user discovers a better search engine then switching is the easiest thing in the world. The main barriers to entry that exist around Google search are that search is really hard to do, not that Google have some kind of lock in that makes it hard to change search engines.<p>I really like joe_the_user's Mongol Hoard analogy. Google aren't scorching the earth or building a moat or otherwise erecting barriers to entry around search. With Android, for example, they are attempting to ensure that no fortifications can be built on the surrounding land. That's a very different thing.",1301123793

What I like about it is the nice looking user interface and the web browser. (As a phone itself Samsung Focus is awesome). The actual Windows Phone 7 OS is awful. I put in a 16gb memory card a few months ago and it's incredibly slow. Everything takes a long time to load. By ""long time to load"" I mean 5+ minutes to open an app. All of the apps are tremendously slower after installing that memory card. That's most likely due to the memory card itself, but it's practically unheard of for phones to have dramatic performance reductions after installing a memory card. That makes me believe it's the software.<p>I really bought it because A) I like to try new things and B) I like developing with .NET/Silverlight because of the awesome development tools.<p>I had a G1 before and although not as slow as that was (I updated it to 2.2 at the time), this OS isn't a good buy.<p>The phone itself though is really nice, it has a high resolution screen (480x800) with a 5 mega-pixel camera and it's really light.",1301123152

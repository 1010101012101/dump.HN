5550165,comment,5548730,5549820,7,0,PeterisP,,,"""Only a large and powerful state can implement the required blocks to form monopolies."" - now that is decidedly false; if there are any entry barriers (such as capital investments required to start), then free market naturally tends to consolidate (as it's more profitable) towards monopolies or oligopolies, which coincidentally means the end of free market in that industry. Only a powerful state can <i>PREVENT</i> monopolies and keep the free market economy as defined, with many suppliers and buyers setting the prices in a market instead of a monopolistic ultimatum.<p>For real life examples, see the classic USA situations of railway and oil magnates in 19th century - these monopolies weren't caused by the state and regulations, but by lack of it.<p>Of course, states can also create bad monopolies, but the solution is to change government actions, not to ""disarm"" the state - since in that case the bad monopolies will stay anyway, and even more monopolies will arise.",1366009180

Some alternate coins have been developed already, maybe not enough to exceed the network effects, but these improvements pile up.

Excludable means that I can, as a seller, prevent you from using it without payment.<p>Most physical goods are rivalrous and excludable. I can keep an icecream to myself and while I am digesting it, you are not. The icecream truck can prevent you taking one without payment. This meets the definition of what people usually think of as ""private property"".<p>Radio waves are rivalrous but not excludable; economists call these ""common goods"". These lead to -- you guessed it -- the tragedy of the commons, where individually optimal decisions lead to globally suboptimal outcomes.<p>Commons can't work unless agents agree to constrain themselves, or are made to constrain themselves. The former can happen by agreement, the latter by regulation.<p>In the case of radio, regulation has been the standard model because of the nature of the usage. Voice and vision have been analogue and the human nervous system is a poor demultiplexer, so they needed bands to themselves. Similarly for many other applications (radar, for example) , the amount of information put through a certain band has historically been low but the value high. So: regulation.<p>Wireless networks are an example of a commons managed by agreement; or perhaps managed by emergent phenomena. Each wireless node blindly follows some simple rules (such as randomised exponential backoff) that, in practice, make a shared medium largely usable.<p>edits: to clarify terms a bit",1366008524

5550081,comment,5516714,5529958,1,0,codeonfire,,,"Skill matters and the most important skill is raw problem solving.  Designing and typing in the code with tests and all is the easiest part of software development.  The hard part are the insidious bugs and malfunctions.  These take a HUGE amount of skill to solve effectively.  If someone only writes code for a few hours a week they are not solving the hard technical problems.  Why does the server deadlock?  Why does the application sometimes crash after a click?  Each one of these usually is a five hour problem.  In a 40 hour week an average developer can solve eight of these if they do absolutely nothing else.  The skill that is developed solving these issues cuts the problem solving down to maybe an hour and adds time that can be applied to coding, design, meetings, and everything else.  Unskilled people are going to be stuck on the problem for weeks.<p>There was a recent kernel leap second bug that caused CPU usage to spike in certain applications.  A part time coder is not going to have enough skill to even deduce that what they are seeing is this type of bug.  They probably would not even know what the kernel is or what the code looks like.  The usual reaction to showstopper challenges is to proclaim that there is just a really simple answer that should only take a few more minutes of effort to discover.  In reality, for someone without the right skills, it is going to take weeks of full time effort to discover.  Does a part time developer/manager go home on the weekend and read release notes and look at kernel code?<p>As far as raw coding, there are far too many tools and libraries in use to learn even within a full-time job.  A modern large application will use several hundred packages (some use thousands).  With only a few hours a week, a developer is only going to be able to learn what one or two of those packages do and their API.  Looking up the API is not enough.  If it can't be determined what the library does then it doesn't matter what the API says.  The developer usually has to learn the internals and that takes lots of hours.<p>Contrary to what most people think, one cannot look up all the practices, idioms, and patterns used in programming.  It's like saying a painter can just look up a technique in a book mid-painting.  Can a surgeon sit in a surgery with an anatomy book open or a guide on cauterization?  A developer has to have a very wide repertoire, not just for one language, but for 3-5 languages that are going to be used in a modern application.  If you look up every bit of the thousands of pieces of information, nothing would ever get finished.<p>People who manage and code a few hours are usually being disingenuous, and I have worked with a couple.  They do something very, very simple with one single component and use that as evidence that it's not really that difficult.  For instance, make an form and then proclaim that web applications are easy because a form took 30 minutes to set up.  The form, however, is microscopic in terms of the total effort needed to run an application or set of applications.  They blow off entire requirements areas such as security or performance.  Does the form have any security or performance requirements?  Who cares, right? They're just part time developers, someone else will finish it.  Part time devs are not even going to understand why performance or security are important.  Most people that would be in the part time camp have less than two years of experience as a developer and are still in that formative early phase where the only requirement is 'does it work'.<p>Of course part time devs get to choose where to give up along the way.  If the form is too hard maybe they add a few links or something and call it development.  A full time developer does not have the luxury of picking and choosing tasks that are easiest. Part time developers simply try to redefine the meaning of 'good developer' to the point that they can reach their own weak standard and gain some developer credit.",1366007147

Perhaps, alternatively, they thought it was worth experimenting with, say: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_market"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_market</a> .<p>Another explanation would be that someone at a gov't agency figured out that a crypto-currency was likely to come into existence at one point or another, and if/when one did, it would be very useful/necessary to buy a lot of it/get involved. If the currency was designed by someone else/a large open source community, it might (or might not) have flaws in it that could render the currency fundamentally unstable and make questionable any involvement of the agency in the currency (e.g., they'd have to choose which cryto-currencies to invest in, they might find it difficult to work with the authors to correct any systemic flaws, they'd probably have to buy a lot of the currency rather late in the game). Another reason is that, if the agency in question designed the currency itself, it would have a large head-start on putting together the hardware that could be used to disrupt it/eliminate it, if need be (c.f. US military control of GPS). Who knows, perhaps the RAND Corporation put out a report forecasting the introduction of crypto-currencies and showing that the organization/state that first introduced it would gain a significant strategic win.<p>If I were an administrator of the NSA/CIA/whatever, I can imagine being won over by arguments that a crypto-currency was inevitable, and that my agency/country would have a major advantage (financially and strategically) if it designed said currency itself rather than letting someone else do it.",1366006285

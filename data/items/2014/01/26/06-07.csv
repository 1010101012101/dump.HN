This is the same explanation given every time, and every time the users are the ones completely screwed over. I think this is a justification to yourself rather than the underlying truth.<p>> Our users were constantly on our mind.<p>If that were true, you wouldn&#x27;t have sold the company to Google, as the outcome is not out of the ordinary by any means. So though they may have been on your mind, your users were ultimately not your priority.<p>> It was a real and sustainable business.<p>Then why sell it? Which leads to:<p>> We felt like we could make the product better by joining with Google.<p>and<p>> Picnik continued to grow dramatically while we were at google.<p>Which means you prioritized growth over ensuring service and supporting your customers for the long term. This isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s how you expand the business, but it does show your priority was not the customers you already had.<p>Which brings us back to the original point:<p>> This doesn&#x27;t really apply to Picnik.<p>I think you&#x27;re deluding yourself, not in a way that implies any sort of insanity, but more of a coping mechanism so you don&#x27;t have to confront the fact that your biggest priority was money and not your users. In the end, you (really your board, which I think includes you) sold to Google, relinquishing control over the long term care of your users. That is the action, and that is what is ultimately true.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re a bad person by any means. I would have made the same decision. Lets just be honest about outcomes. I think it&#x27;s easy to be tricked in these acquisition offers, mainly because your personal outcome is ensured. You are getting lots of money, and you get the opportunity to see if you&#x27;re business can get really big. The problem is, this actually puts a make or break ultimatum on your business. If you don&#x27;t get the rapid growth you were hoping for, or your business doesn&#x27;t align with the parent company down the road, then your business is broken (shut down by the parent) and your customers lose. So this is the gamble you face, and either way your future is positive, but you&#x27;re betting with your customers, and when it doesn&#x27;t work out they lose, but you don&#x27;t.",1390719499

I like how they&#x27;re letting developers test a feature idea/theory, but it&#x27;d be great too if they&#x27;d let users of products suggest features for software they use and suggest how much they&#x27;d be willing to pay for it.<p>For example, I use (and love!) Workflowy, and I&#x27;d pay $20 to have the ability to upload images directly into an outline-item and $50 for an Android client (yes, BTW, yes I would).<p>These could be considered pledges which the developer could get people to commit to before they build the feature out.",1390719434

I really tried to go out of my way to avoid giving that impression; that&#x27;s why I called them &quot;unflappable&quot;, among many other things.<p>I do understand the point you&#x27;re aiming for here. But when the premise of your objection is so explicitly at odds with my actual words, it might be a good idea to ask yourself whether you really understand the point that I&#x27;m trying to make. (And not entirely succeeding in making, clearly!)<p>The biggest problem with your objection, to my eye, is that you&#x27;re only talking about this as one isolated joke, while I&#x27;m trying to consider it as part of a broader pattern. The really frustrating part of this discussion, for me, is that I already made exactly that clarification <i>to you</i> (in more detail) nine hours ago in this same thread (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7122412"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7122412</a>). You didn&#x27;t address that point then, and in writing what you have here you make it clear that it&#x27;s still not something you&#x27;re thinking about.<p>The pattern is the point. The cumulative impact of culture is the point. It&#x27;s not calling women fragile to say that a lot of them get awfully sick of being peppered with these little signals of not-belonging hour after hour, day after day. Some may be fine with it, but many others clearly aren&#x27;t. So why is it controversial to say &quot;Ok, let&#x27;s not do that&quot;?",1390719413

(Ungenerous readings are very common in &#x27;discussions&#x27; like this, on both sides.)<p>You&#x27;re translating the claim to a nebulous sense of victimhood, but that&#x27;s not really the context, is it? Instead, the example <i>should</i> be that you&#x27;re claiming to be subject to discrimination that I am not based on a quantifiable categorical difference between us -- you are gay and I am straight, you are a woman and I am a man, you are black and I am white. Given that context, the question becomes whether I should give you a benefit of the doubt in your claim based on that experience.<p>When a woman claims that &quot;brogrammer culture&quot; is insensitive and indeed exclusive to the point where the phrase &quot;bro pages&quot; really does come across as twitch-inducing, she&#x27;s not making that claim based on &quot;self-proclaimed victimhood.&quot; She&#x27;s making it based on experience that you not only do not share, but that it is <i>literally impossible for you to share.</i> You can&#x27;t be subject to the same kind of discrimination she is.<p>And yes, it&#x27;s patronizing for men to come in and make that claim on her behalf. But isn&#x27;t it even more patronizing for men to come in and say that she has no basis to make that claim? It seems to me that a lot of comments here are on the edge of (or over the edge of) &quot;women who want to be treated equally to men shouldn&#x27;t complain that language can ever make them feel unwelcome.&quot; And that sounds uncomfortably like we&#x27;re saying to women: you can&#x27;t disagree. You can&#x27;t do <i>anything</i> other than supplicate.",1390719409

There is value in a service because it enables meaningless communication. Is this what it&#x27;s come to?<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s a problem that your family didn&#x27;t communicate before Snapchat. Perhaps it would be better to address that, rather than substitute meaningless communication, then call it good. Perhaps Snapchat is making you feel better now, but leaving you worse off in the long run--kind of like heroin. The more you use it, the emptier you feel.<p>><i>Snapchat captures some of the core emotions and psychology there that nothing else before it had.</i><p>How about actually taking time to visit with people and talk to them? How about having actual experiences with them? Do these capture core emotions? What is this idea that every human or social function has to have an app or be captured in a product (and monetized)? Why does the act of filling our human needs require interception and redirection for the sake of profit?<p>Snapchat is just one in a sea of products (including media, celebrity worship, reality shows, etc.) aimed at making life a series of distractions from the emptiness and meaninglessness that haunt us. Of course, these very distractions in lieu of pursuing thoughtful, meaningful lives and quality relationships leave us feeling even emptier; thus ever hungrier for the next distraction. A vicious cycle if ever there was one.<p>Snapchat is an empty tool of distraction, that happens to fit a culture which is pushing itself to crave ever more of the same. Period. Trying to credit it for filling some deep emotional need is like crediting the iceberg&#x27;s mass for later slowing the Titanic&#x27;s sinking. Snapchat isn&#x27;t the solution for what ails us.

Editors, businessmen and politicians will always choose the visualization that empasises their point (i.e. distorts the underlying data). While they are happy with the results Tufte is dismayed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons</a>",1390718032

7124089,comment,7123833,7123833,30,0,gruseom,,,"I noticed that this list was made by Martin Seymour-Smith. He was an English poet and critic whose masterpiece was called <i>Guide to Modern World Literature</i>. It is a monster of a book that covers hundreds (thousands?) of writers, a tour de force that is nearly impossible to believe was put together by one person. I used to spend hours poring over it in the reference section of the library. For such an encyclopedia, it&#x27;s remarkable how idiosyncratic and addictive it is. He makes no attempt to be balanced or standard about anything; he just gives his personal views—for example he pooh-poohs Eliot and says that the greatest poet of the 20th century was César Vallejo. So, unlike most reference works, it&#x27;s surprisingly intimate. It&#x27;s like having an uncle who knows everything and will happily tell you all about anyone you name.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s even perverse, as he loves nothing better than to champion the obscure and take the famous and well-established down a peg. So I suppose it&#x27;s fitting that basically no one has heard of his work.<p>I discovered him years ago on a long bus trip with a layover in Salt Lake City, where I went to a used bookstore. His book--actually an earlier, smaller one called &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in 20th Century Literature&quot;, smaller but still massive--was on a shelf in the basement of the store. I looked someone up in it and thought &quot;this is interesting&quot;, sat on the floor and looked someone else up, and then another and so on. I became engrossed for hours, and then suddenly woke up and realized that I was sitting on the basement floor of a bookstore in a strange city. I remember I had to run to the bus station and barely made it. That book, and then later the astonishing one I described above, became close companions of mine for years, the sort of thing where the author is your mentor and friend and you feel vividly that you know him.

Also, the chain of transmission can be indirect, so that even if you can't get a physical item into the target, you can plant it somewhere else where it eventually spread to the target (only so many degrees of separation between any two power plants, it seems)",1285239574

As for ""mutations and clones"" - these are computer viruses, not the organic kind.<p>People can imitate the techniques and develop on them, but as long as copies from and to USB drives maintain their multiple-9s accuracy there won't be much spontaneous change outside of the deployer's control. Instead, the big uncertainty factor with worms and viruses has usually been emergent behavior when the infected computers network into one very large system, leading to behaviors that don't show up in small-scale tests.

Even with advanced LOD algorithms, the open-ended world concept requires so many polygons to render that today's hardware is simply not sufficient to render it.

The guarantee to have a significant share of the market should convince either. Two distinct services cater distinct preferences across ties, optimally for both.

For the last 10 years, every time you were looking for some information regarding places you should visit, things you should buy, you were going to Google, typed your query and filter through its results to find something you might like. For serious purchases, you'd go to review sites, forums and other user generated content sites.<p>Today, most of your friends are on FB. Let's say you're planning a trip to Italy and don't really know the places you should go, and hotels you should stay at. If you ask that question on FB (which thus replace Google), some of your friends might give you recommendations based on their past experiences. If your best friend stayed in a nice hotel in Firenze, and was satisfied by the experience, his recommendation weights <i>much</i> more importance than a random guy on a random forum.<p>A significant part of ad dollars that would traditionally go to Google, would fly to FB. Hunch and Quora play in the same league. Google is dethroned from the number 1 destination to ""ask for information"".<p>Facebook questions + credits will certainly bring in a ton of revenues for FB but I doubt they'll make FB worth $25 billion one day…",1285237348

It can't be money because he's literally throwing away billions.  He wont live long enough to take over the world.  I think he just wants to go down in history as providing the best user experiences so he's doing what he thinks will make that most likely.  You may disagree with how he's trying (I do myself on some things) but I think he believes in it.<p>Compared to that, how benevolent is Google actually?  Not that they need to be.  They don't owe that to anyone anymore than Jobs does.  So I wish conversations about Apple/Google could drop the good/evil nonsense.  It's about trade offs and results.  Why they do what they do is their own business.<p>EDIT: Removed unnecessary sentence (made an irrelevant call on Google's benevolence).",1285237229

In a country where risk-aversion is intrinsecally rooted in the business culture, it's difficult to be serious about any business plan that dosen't lie in a well established market, but not impossible.

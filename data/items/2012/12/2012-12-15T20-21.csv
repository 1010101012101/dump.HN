Remember, those folks are just uploading PHP files to their shared host - they don't have a local development environment, let alone a custom-configured production setup.<p>Is it unfortunate that a lot of production sites run with stupid settings because they aren't run by full-time software engineers or sysadmins? Sure.

The problem is we judge books by their covers. We're more likely to pick the prettiest object up first.""<p>Why would you value a shortcut for assessing quality more than an actual improvement in quality? The fact that design is better is a huge all around win for everyone. Does it make every product good? Of course not, but so what?<p>Not too long ago, you could perhaps have measured the quality of a house by the question: 'does it have running water?'. If the answer was yes, you could assume someone put a lot of effort into the house, and that everything else about it was likely to be better too. Today, all houses have running water. Is that a bad thing? That would be an absurd claim to make. The fact that all houses (even the relatively bad ones) have running water is a huge win.<p>The point is that running water makes any house better, and good design makes any product better.

4926293,comment,4925878,4925983,4,0,Firehed,,,"Most beginners are not going to be looking at their error log, or even know where to look for it.  In a development environment, I think display_errors is a very reasonable behavior, and is in line with PHP's goals: be easy to get up and running, even (especially?) for novice programmers. Even people that have been doing this for a decade may forget to tail their logs, so having execution-time warnings makes a lot of sense, and is really the only practical approach for an interpreted language.<p>I've made vague suggestions (though not written up a full spec/RFC... one of these days) about improving the overall error handling system in PHP since I think there are a limited set of common behaviors that involve a lot of repeated code to get, which basically amount to ""use strict"". That way people doing serious projects that need a flexible language can get decent and consistent error handling, and newbies hacking together their first dynamic website can continue to work without hitting a brick wall of a learning curve.<p>When I was first learning to code, something like display_errors would have been great. As it was I just had a few compiler warnings, but (especially as a newbie) who cares as long as it compiles and runs? Getting random warning text printed out on your web page is a real incentive to fix things, but without being so harsh that you just give up. Of course that doesn't scale to larger projects, but it doesn't need to. In PHP's case, that's what set_error_handler() is for.",1355604438

4926285,comment,4925893,4925893,3,0,jacquesm,,,"I checked 'other' as well because I don't actually write a lot of the code I use software to write it for me. The idea of programs writing other programs has fascinated me pretty much since I started with computers and it has never left me. So if I feel that a piece of code is repetitive I write a chunk of code to write code like that and then re-invoke the generator when I need more code like that. As an example: structures, serialization, de-serialization, validation, allocation, freeing, database storage, variations of the same algorithm in different languages and so on.<p>To a lisp programmer this would be second nature (they'd wonder why it's so special) but in other languages it can be quite a hassle to keep multiple instances around of similar code.<p>Code generation is a real booster, the biggest gains I'm getting are 100:1 (a small 10 line definition spitting out a 1000+ lines of code), there is nothing to re-factor just update the generator inputs and hit 'make', old generated code is stripped, new generated code will be inserted into the project so you can inspect it afterwards (and to the compiler it looks just like ordinary human written code). The code generator writes comments as well to clarify the output.<p>Writing the generators can be quite tricky, you have to think on two levels at once (the code you're writing and the code you want to generate). There are some shortcuts here to make that process easier.<p>The end result of this process is to have code produced very with - once a single example has been produced and debugged - a much reduced chance of errors.",1355604258

It was originally scheduled to be raised when unemployment fell below 6.5% (happened in April 2013). Otherwise, unless the Fed has some other crazy plan (another wave of QE) there&#x27;s not much more that they have control of over the moment.",1437757174
9943398,comment,9942866,9943268,0,0,joshjkim,,,"It&#x27;s getting easier with companies like sharespost.com but securities regulation generally discourage the sale of private company stock in any &quot;open&quot; (aka. public) way - this is ostensibly to protect buyers of stock from investing in risky assets that they know little about and for which there is little public information.<p>Buyers are generally hesitant because they want to get financial info and other private data to make an analytic investment decision. Given that VC-style investment are more normalized now and they aren&#x27;t as based on fundamentals, investors are definitely more willing to invest without private financials BUT really large asset managers (who spend 99% of their funds on public stocks with their expansive disclosures) will not tolerate this, limiting the market. Besides, they are getting common stock, which sucks compared to the other investors who get preferred stock.<p>Companies don&#x27;t usually want this to happen because they don&#x27;t want a shareholder (who has voting and other legal rights) that they don&#x27;t know or trust, and who is not aligned with them in the way that employees and VC are (supposed to be..ha).<p>The solution growing in popularity tries to deal with all of these by having a company organize a secondary offering, like what pinterest does (palantir does it too, twilio recently did, so do a bunch of companies). Usually this means the company knows the buyer (sometimes an existing investor) and basically gives them the info they would give a VC, except the investors buys employee shares rather than new stock - sometimes this will be asked for an investor when they are doing a preferred stock deal, and the investor will agree as an additional &quot;company favorable&quot; term. Important to note here too, that USUALLY the biggest sellers in these deals are the founders, so while it&#x27;s a very nice thing for them to do for their employees, there&#x27;s some healthy self-interest there as well =)",1437757149

The Left Wing was primarily socialist and communalist. It emphasized the similarity between people, races, countries, sexes. What we have in common is more important than what separates us.<p>The Internet and the stcredzero&#x27;s thesis says is that the Internet shows what defines groups as being different, as being the other. The Left has, along with the Internet and along with many of us here who may see ourselves as supporting social justice, focused on the differences between people. The group of persons is more and more defined, the individuals within a society is more and more defined. The differences between people and groups are more and more emphasized with the Internet.<p>The Internet has not led to an increase in communality, it has not led to an increase on people feeling like they are more similar to others. The Left used to and socialist used to work against a trend of group psychology to bring together peoples into a whole, to reduce differences. The successful politicians recognize the important of group thinking. In the recent UK election, the party who ran with the ideology of &quot;all in it together&quot; and &quot;the party of the working people&quot; was the right wing Conservatives!

They use this for stuff like correlating part failures to operational conditions, determining which intermittent wiper setting people use as well as improving the logic for the operation of critical systems (e.g. if my last inputs were $stuff then don&#x27;t upshift).  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they sold the data as well.  McDonalds would love to know where and when people start looking for food. insurance companies would love to have more variables to correlate to risk trivial (e.g. $color cars with $trivial_feature get in accident that cost $really_small_percent $more_or_less than $other_color<p>To segregate systems you need to be able to pitch to the bean-counters that the cost/benefit of whatever degree of segregation you&#x27;re proposing beats the cost/benefit of whatever plan the next guy is proposing.  These data sets are incredibly valuable to many different parts of the company.  The people doing marketing and customer facing stuff would be at a severe competitive disadvantage if they had to wait months (first oil change) o get real world data on feature usage after a re-design.<p>Sure you could download it at service time...&quot;but we already have a system that does it in near real time, can&#x27;t we just secure that?&quot;...<p>TL;DR: Segregating systems involves more than having the engineers wait a few months to figure out if their new tune solved the problem.",1437757054

Most companies don&#x27;t &quot;allow&quot; you to do this. I&#x27;ve heard conflicting things on the subject. Some say the company has no say in the matter and it&#x27;s purely in the IRS&#x27; court (exercise and notify IRS). Others say the company must allow you to do it.<p>Second, the bogeyman of &quot;letting some strange interloper see our books&quot; is a myth. Every company&#x27;s share plan that has share restrictions, also does not confer disclosure rights to common shareholders. That is, you have no right to see the books if you&#x27;re a common shareholder in these companies. It&#x27;s not the same with public equities as it is with this new round of startups. It used to be that case that you exercised 1 share of stock upon hitting your cliff. That way you could see the books and see what&#x27;s really going on. The powers that be (Hello YC) have instructed their companies to  remove disclosure rights as a workaround.<p>The myth that &quot;having lots of shareholders increases costs too much&quot; is also just a myth.

Retention is really hard, and this is an incredibly powerful retention device at a fast growing company.<p>As an employee though, you can always vote with your feet.  When considering a job at a startup, you should go over the stock option plan and ask hard questions.  Remember... the founders (generally) don&#x27;t have stock options.  So sometimes founders at small startups don&#x27;t even know the implications of the stock option plan they&#x27;ve created, and might be open to changing it if it means the difference between hiring you and not hiring you.<p>And for the larger companies that have thought about it, you can always pick the ones with more employee friendly plans.  The higher the initial value of the company when joining, the harder it is to exercise options if you can&#x27;t sell the stock immediately (because you have both a high exercise price and taxes on gains).

Anytime that you allow a company to have significant control over an employee&#x27;s life, such as putting a significant risk of deportation on the employee, you are putting the employee at severe personal risk. This is the central problem with guest worker programs, as you incentivize the company to threaten employees in order to keep them working for you and their costs down.<p>I had an intense argument with someone about whether H1B&#x27;s were good or bad for the economy. The key point he was arguing was that H1B employees <i>do not</i> have significantly less salary, and they are fully capable of switching companies.<p>In my experience, the primary reason that a company would go through the hassle of hiring an H1B is for cost reasons, because there are enough competent workers locally there to fulfill open positions (at a price), and the quality of H1B workers is generally less than local hires. On rare occasions a foreign worker has extremely unique skills, but this is certainly the exception.<p>Secondly, it is very difficult for an H1B to switch companies, as it&#x27;s difficult to convince a company to go through the hassle of paperwork / lawyers / cost, so an H1B employee has little recourse for being treated poorly and paid less.<p>Therefore, I&#x27;m against H1B&#x27;s.

To not understand someone is to deliberately not give the issue thought because you&#x27;re so deeply embedded in the idea that you have enough background on an issue to decidedly say that you are right and that the reasoning behind your stance is flawless, and thus that they are wrong. I believe that everyone&#x27;s beliefs and actions are understandable. They might used flawed logic, or they might value things differently than you, but I believe 100% that everyone on this earth uses reasoning for every action and opinion we have.<p>But when it comes to politicians trying to ban encryption and automakers trying to ban me from editing bits on a memory chip that I got as a part of purchasing one of their cars, I really am unapologetic when I say I really don&#x27;t understand them. I completely and utterly lack an ability to get into their heads. It would be fascinating to lose my knowledge of everything I know about computers for a day and give these issues thought. To have computers be mystical voodoo magic would be an amazingly different world.<p>If I had to give it a guess, that&#x27;s probably what I&#x27;d say. Politicians and automakers and middle aged Edward Snowden haters all lack an idea of what is possible and what is unpractical when it comes to computers. They lack an appreciation for just how much commonality there is between the computer running a McDonald&#x27;s register and the one making sure their car doesn&#x27;t kill them.<p>Politicians think we can just &quot;ban&quot; encryption, as if this isn&#x27;t some mathematical concept with freely-available professionally made implementations. They think Apple has gone to great lengths just to implement their end-to-end iMessage encryption... when in reality they almost certainly took the path of least resistance and merely stand on the shoulders of giants that collectively implemented encryption for them. PR reps for automakers think of code in such an abstract way that they think modifying it must be terribly difficult and thus inherently malicious, when in reality their programmers stood on the shoulders of giants and used the same common interfaces that every programmer uses. Hacking their car was probably done by a curious man decompiling the firmware which they pulled off via JTAG or a test clip. They think Edward Snowden must have been sneaking around in underground tunnels with a ski mask and plugging his laptop into servers, when in reality this was just a drive that was mounted on a machine he used.<p>Tl;dr: Programmers all pretty much follow the path of least resistance.

Your strategy is inherently two single factor systems, not a two factor system. This is what gives its ability for cascades of compromise.<p>The correct way to do this would be to have the keys corresponding to each server represent an XOR of your password for that server with a base key stored on a physical device, combining the two pieces of information to generate the final key.

Note that DoD only reports contracts over $6.5m. So the bulk of their DoD awards must be falling under that threshold.<p><i>edit</i> here&#x27;s a 5 year contract from DoJ for ~$10m. <a href=""http://www.govconwire.com/2014/04/doj-selects-palantir-software-to-analyze-money-laundering-cases/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.govconwire.com/2014/04/doj-selects-palantir-softw...</a> hardly $20billion dollar valuation contract sizes.<p>So it&#x27;s likely most of their growth trajectory has been in specialized consulting services that direct customers to their products, but also use other tools and solutions. But again, once the ecosystem is big enough, the government can just try to compete that work out and hire another company to handle that work...companies that might not direct the solution-space towards Palantir&#x27;s products.<p>1 - <a href=""https://www.palantir.com/partnerships/service-providers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.palantir.com/partnerships/service-providers/</a>",1437755022

More recently the acquistion of Financial Times by Nikkei for over a billion dollars (during times of declining subscription and falling ad revenues, washington post was 5 bought for times less to Bezos). There are so many other poor acquisition strategies coming out of Japan, I can&#x27;t help but question if there&#x27;s some inherent flaw to Japanese thinking at least when it comes to market stategies. They almost certainly pay a huge premium for no good reason, and are unable to spruce it up, either due to incompatible culture or god knows what.

The simple fact is that people take all kinds of shortcuts in making decisions, and very little of the workplace is an actual meritocracy.<p>When I first entered the workplace as a programmer, I was not taken as seriously as I might have been because I was so young.  I got my first programming job at 16, and even when I started doing major consulting gigs across the country at 19, I looked really young for my age. One client remarked, upon meeting me, &quot;You don&#x27;t look old enough to operate a car, much less our computer.&quot;  It was always a challenge for me to get people to evaluate my ideas based on their merit rather than their source, and to evaluate me based on my work product, rather than where they were at in their career when they were my age.<p>I have worked for myself for many years now, but if I sought employment elsewhere, I&#x27;d probably face some difficulties because I&#x27;m much older than the average developer, and people would assume that I&#x27;m stuck in old technologies as many professional developers my age are.<p>But the truth is that unfounded discrimination happens all the time in the workplace, for all kinds of reasons.  Almost nowhere is a true meritocracy.  At one place I worked, even when I was at the perfect average age for software developers, and white, and male, even then I was cut out of the circle of the key developers.  It was because the developers, owner, and key management liked to stop working many days around 10:30am and start drinking heavily, maybe stopping back by the office briefly some time in the afternoon, then go back to drinking steadily the rest of the day until 6 or 7 pm.  I didn&#x27;t really do that with the same kind of endless enthusiasm that they did.  I didn&#x27;t fit in very well.<p>If you find a group of people that accept you the way you are, and evaluate you based on the work you do, you&#x27;ve found gold.  If mere excellence is the currency of the realm, and all they want from you is to be the best you can be, then that&#x27;s a glorious place to be.  But finding such a place is very rare.  It&#x27;s hard to find that in a workplace, a church, a group of friends, or anywhere.  And if you&#x27;re struggling to find that, it&#x27;s not entirely because of race, gender, age, or sexual orientation-- it&#x27;s mostly because of people&#x27;s basic nature.",1437754345

4340829,comment,4339999,4340331,3,0,tzs,,,"> A rule like ""In compound expressions with multiple sub-expressions the intended order of evaluation shall be made explicit with parentheses"" is particularly challenging. I spent a few weeks on this rule! I was banging my head, trying to learn the fundamentals of parsing languages, spending my hours diving into wikipedia articles and learning lex and yacc.<p>Hmmm....how about this? If the code is parenthesized enough, then the precedence and associativity of the operators has no effect on the shape of the parse tree. So, if you take the expression and repeatedly make random changes to the operators and parse it, and you keep getting the same shape for the parse tree, it is sufficiently parenthesized.",1344149876

Just revert the file.<p>However, my reading of the Apple support document [1] is that versions are discarded over time. It says:<p>> OS X Lion manages the version history of a document, keeping hourly versions for a day, daily versions for a month, and weekly versions for all previous months.<p>This would seem to indicate that if you downloaded a file from your camera, then made changes that were autosaved to the original file, the original version would be discarded after 24 hours had passed--the several ""hourly"" versions reduced to a single ""daily"" version.<p>If that is true, it is really problematic.

You caught me before my edit :)<p>I still stand by the assertion that investors are looking for something different than the typical employee. It seems to be a large risk for a large reward; I don't want to presume to speak for you, but usually investors are both looking for a large exit that an employee will not really benefit from, and can be involved with many companies at once to minimize their risk.<p>I definitely agree for investors that the startup you pick is more important than the stage its in when you pick it. But that's still involving a significant chunk of the stock even in later rounds. Ultimately, unless the employee is getting a large chunk of the company (in which case he <i>should</i> think as an investor and <i>would</i> be wise to go for YC companies) the decision process should be different.",1344146605

However I do find it rather curious and ironic that you of all people, an original member of the Java team, were burned by quality problems in Java.

A basic package, let's just ballpark somewhere around $25-$50 where I would ship out strictly wholesale products each month, not really based on preferences.

This package would require an indepth questionnaire and possibly further communication as ideas run dry like you said.<p>BTW: thanks for the return tip.

You can get along almost anywhere just on English and foreigners will usually be more interested in practicing English with you ahead of helping you practice whatever foreign tongue interests you.<p>Nevertheless I think it was worth it.  I acquired Spanish fluency as an adult and the experience continues to enrich my life.<p>Spanish is a good choice for English speakers because it's the world's second most widespread language.  It's also fairly regular and overlaps some English vocabulary.<p>But you should, if you can find the time, try to learn at least one foreign language in your life, even if your first is the world's new <i>lingua franca</i>.",1297238330

Instead of storing documents and running searches against them, you can store searches and feed in a document and ask ""which search queries would this match"". It turns search upside down.

You have just one version of your code for all user agents, and then you enhance it for agents that have better features.<p>Now worrying about having to build your templates twice -- once in your back end language, and then in JavaScript -- is a valid concern.  Code duplication is never good.  However, mustache is supported by many many languages (<a href=""http://mustache.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mustache.github.com/</a>) which means that you really can build your templates just once and call out to very similar code to populate them with data.<p>Yes, you would need to run tests against the site with and without JavaScript (or CSS or XHR or any other feature that you were using to progressively enhance your page, but how far you go is really up to you), but if that's automated, it isn't much effort on your part.<p>I'll be the first to admit that it's fine to cheat in the code to give your users a better experience, but I don't think it's a good idea purely to take development short cuts or cut costs.

2196746,comment,2196421,2196699,0,0,TimothyBurgess,,,"I had a feeling this would get turned into a bit of a competition and that's not what I'm after.  But I will guarantee that most of the time, computer science and computer engineers code on the same level.  (You seemed to imply compsci codes on a higher level than engineers.)<p>I also have a feeling the number of C.S. majors greatly outnumbers the number of C.E. majors here so I expect many to upvote pro C.S. posts and many to downvote pro C.E. posts.  Just competitive nature of the business I guess.  ;)<p>I'll mention that network protocols, graph theory (every year actually), caching, and databases were all covered during the latter half of my undergraduate education.  Different sorting methods and a few other theoretical concepts were covered (briefly) as well.  And that's really all I'm driving at... I'm only curious about the differences between the two main variants of computing education.<p>For C.E.'s, the first 2 years were hardware (physics) and the second 2 years (roughly) were applying that knowledge basically on our own (while still learning a bit more about hardware).<p>There's no doubt that (good) computer engineers can build highly scalable and reliable systems.  I hope you don't think our ability to cohere all of that knowledge is limited to only that.  I feel it's that very ability to piece all of that knowledge together on our own while forming highly complex (and scalable ;)) systems that separates C.E. from C.S.  Note that separation does not imply one is better than the other, only different.<p>For example... building a swarm of robots (any number of them, highly scalable)... requires knowledge of hardware/power (you have to design the robot structure yourself, you know!)... network protocol (for swarm communication)... plenty of feedback algorithms... and even design your own mini-database to organize all of the info between the robots.<p>And another personal example, I've designed a web-based multidimensional database application framework that allows me to create nearly any web app within minutes to days (depending on the scope)... highly scalable... and the database is entirely of my own design, works flawlessly, and benchmarks put it ahead of mysql.  Again, this isn't a competition... I'm just proving a point that I didn't need 20 years of education... just needed a mental map of a computer's internals.  Because specific theories have not been ingrained into my head (just cold hard facts)... I'm able to think outside of the box and <i>sometimes</i> (definitely not every time!) design a better system with a little more effort (because I have to make it up as I go, based on the knowledge I have).<p>But just as I mentioned (and you just confirmed)... C.S. is more of this:<p><i>Okay, this is the best way to code this type of algorithm</i><p>Whereas C.E. majors are this:<p><i>Okay, this is how it all these electrical signals come together logically to compute information. Knowing this, it's up to you to figure out how to code.</i>",1297236728

And yes, there are lots of restaurants that only do dinners, or breakfasts/lunches - but for a restaurant that does two shifts - 11:00 AM is usually a guaranteed time for it being open.<p>But, I don't think I've ever been to a country where the checkin/checkout/restaurant opening wasn't generally true.<p>Admittedly, I haven't been to the ""One Time Zone China"" - that might throw my theory out the door...",1297235786

In theory, clients receiving a 302 in response to a POST are supposed to re-send the POST wherever the redirect leads; in practice, clients do all kinds of different things.

The best way I've found to avoid burnout, even with things you enjoy, is to do things in a balanced manner and adopt good habits. Don't spend your life putting in tons of time squashing fires and then zonking out. Do your best to meet deadlines, but accept some consequences and transition towards a more balanced work ethic. Also, don't be too hard on yourself; that just fuels the paralysis.

Why not have it, like all the other views, in one convenient place? Furthermore, often you have a partial you render on the server side and with some AJAX you send more entities of this partial to the client. Having this partial twice is really tedious if you wan't to tweak the HTML.",1297235090

That <i>does</i> help you understand how to speed things up at a very low level and might be useful for embedded systems programming or kernel hacking.  But most programmers work on a much higher level and need to understand a lot more concepts than that.<p>For instance, it takes a lot more to build a scalable and reliable system (especially one that must scale to multiple systems) than simply knowing how the circuits are designed.  You need to understand network protocols, how things are stored on disk by databases, a bit of graph theory, how caching works, and a whole slew of other things.<p>Would it be beneficial to learn this all from the ground up?  Probably.  But I doubt many college students would be thrilled by the idea of spending 20 years finishing their degree.",1297234817

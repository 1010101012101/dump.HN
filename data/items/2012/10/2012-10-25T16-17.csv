If you mean progress, then that has occurred this year, basically the object recognition problem looks like it can be solved by neural nets (google brain cat detector and the latest imagenet challenge in pascal voc).<p>If applications, then they are literally immense. Robots that can perform any manual labor, thus increase in mnaufacturing ability (plus ability to conduct scientific experiments) by an immense amount. Marshall Brain has good articles about what computer vision technology can enable, including the short story Manna. Computer Vision is easily the most disruptive technology since the invention of the steam engine (it multiplies the work capacity of humanity by that much). It's a new gold rush bigger than the internet (robocars and humanoid robots including Baxter from Rethink Robotics are signs of that beginning). Startups should be all over it, web 2.0 and social networking are miniscule in comparison.",1351184383

Should you have a few people read it over? Yes. Should you spellcheck? Yes. But not much more than that. Focus on building your product and building your business.<p>2) ""no ones video is under a minute.""<p>Ours was. 50 seconds, to be exact.<p>3) ""But my point is, if your company and team is solid, than you will get in.""<p>This is the most dangerous statement in the post. This is simply not the case. Every successful entrepreneur was told ""no"" and turned down time and time again on their path to greatness. Facebook got ""no's"" from VCs. Airbnb's founders were told they were crazy. Many people outright laughed at Elon Musk's dream to build rocket ships. SendGrid was rejected from YC. If you believe in your team, and you believe in your idea, trek on. The YC partners are some of the smartest people I've ever met, but they're not infallible.<p>YC has been absolutely amazing for my team and my company, and we're very grateful for having gone through the program. But we likely wouldn't have been accepted and wouldn't have benefitted so much from the program if we weren't focused intensely on what matters -- building our product, talking to our customers, and staying healthy. Apply, hope you get in, but if you don't, carry on.",1351184364

Could you expand a little bit?<p>>What if you want to separate your identities?<p>Sure, you can do this to preserve some privacy if you think the services might collude. But my point is that multiple keys don't make you more secure. (It's not like symmetric encryption where you <i>should</i> be using different passwords for everything.)<p>>What if you want to limit your responsibility and be able to just permanently delete the key after you finish working with some system thereby completely revoking your access to it?<p>This is a fair point, although having continued access is only a problem if an adversary gains control of the machine containing your private key (and in that case it's usually game over anyway). It's the job of the sysadmin of the other server to revoke authorized_keys as needed.<p>>What if you want to store passwords to some keys in your system keyring but enter the pass every time for others?<p>Again, a fair point, but this is only a risk if a bad guy has control of your machine. In general I'm referring to the misconception many people have that using multiple keys protects them if an external service is compromised. While this is true for passwords, for asymmetric crypto, revealing a public key is not really a problem.",1351184351

Full-featured computers in schools are expensive for this sort of task, and not everybody can take their work home with them to expand upon itor even just to do homework. At around the price of a textbook, the Raspberry Pi makes that at least possible.<p>The low price, suggested curriculum, etc., are a big part of making it work.

For much of the early fall, very little gas would be needed to support a very large balloon that would retard the fall and limit terminal velocity. If your velocity stays low from the start, you never have to worry about heat building up. As the descent continued, eventually the atmosphere would thicken to the point that the balloon provided actual buoyancy, and subsequently a controlled descent could be made. Perhaps two balloons would be required, one weak, large one for the initial fall at the edge of the atmosphere and another stronger one for the final descent through ordinary weather conditions. The question is, how big would that first balloon need to be at the altitude of the space station?",1351183259

In my experience, the difficulty of the day job is largely irrelevant; personally, I've felt more exhausted or unwilling to get things done after doing nothing all day at a day job than I am when I've actually had something consequential to do. Having a resource like this to draw from and connect with other smart founders who know the score and are willing to pay for expertise is something I would take advantage of in order to take back control over my time. So as others have done, I've built something that I myself would use. Why the list model?

Assembler eats the first thing that arrives and signs the second, even if the bill comes before the food.<p>Clojure is ""type-safe"" in that it will exit instead of performing an illogical action  (e.g. dividing a string pointer by a network socket).

779110,comment,778366,778670,0,0,arghnoname,,,"There are certainly a lot of jobs that don't really require a college education for a person of decent intellect, and some kinds of programming are some of them, but I do think there are also careers that require a level of dedicated study that is really difficult for most people to accomplish outside of a structured learning environment like college and where it's difficult to quickly learn it on the job.<p>FWIW, I didn't go to college. I've often tried to follow lesson plans for the fellows that have, but it can be hard to crack into certain markets without work experience or verified education in an area.",1250923941

That said, it's a little bit of an opt-out, in the same sense that arguing that C++ is just as clean as C because ""you can avoid all the ugly weird parts if you really try"" is something of an opt-out.  (I'm not trying to comment on the relative merits of C++ and C (edit: or, for that matter, on Java <1.5 vs. Java >=1.5), so much as on the relative levels of simplicity of the two languages, just to make certain that's clear).",1250922944

(See a blog like io9, for example.) It could fill much of the front page, every day.<p>But I guess there's nothing to be done about it; there's 43 upvotes and counting, and it's number one on /classic too.<p>So I, for one, welcome our future of big-budget movie trailers, funny robot videos, and debates about 'Lost'/'BSG'/etc. Forward, to mass appeal!",1250921422

Numbers move between tabs. The order you viewed tabs in is remembered. Thumbnail previews on mouseover of tabs is great if you routinely keep 20-30 tabs open. Adblock is a default feature. There's a built in IRC client. I hear the mail client is great, but I use gmail for everything. Fast forward and fast backward is awesome. Having it remember all of my tabs when I open / close the program is sweet. The trash can for deleted tabs is convenient. I absolutely love mouse gestures.<p>I'm sure much of this stuff can be done in Firefox with 20 different plugins, but it's all there by default in Opera and works flawlessly. I have two complaints with Opera, though. First, flash doesn't work well for me in linux with the 9.5 beta and, second, some web sites I have to use for school don't work correctly, so I resort to Firefox for those.<p>Edit: Whoops. That's cost - benefit for developing for a particular browser, not cost - benefit for use. Oh well, maybe someone will find this post useful and consider switching. :)",1201779371

525173,comment,525067,525067,0,0,Kirby,,,"It depends on your biochemistry to a large degree.  Some people need hardly any sleep, some do _much_ better work if they sleep a full night's sleep, which can be defined anywhere between 6 and 10 hours.  Some people do well on a 24-hour clock, some don't.  Minor sleep disorders are common and often not diagnosed.<p>Don't worry about anyone else (one of the luxuries of a lot of tech jobs), find the schedule that leaves you feeling alert and awake and able to get things done.  If you need 8 hours of sleep to be able to code the next day and not walk through the day in a haze - that's you.  If you do well keeping a fixed schedule and not deviating, that's great.  But if not, don't fight it, listen to your body.<p>Similarly, some people can code for 10, 12 hour stretches.  Some people stop doing useful things after 4 hours without a serious break.  Experiment, find what works for you, and _do not_ expect other people to work like you do.  Focus on end goals, not processes.",1237568277

Happily, if you read the comments a Selenium developer has now responded.<p>If I might deconstruct his argument:<p>""As far as I can tell, Selenium Grid requires that you use Selenium to run your tests. Currently no major JavaScript library uses Selenium (and it would be a major shift in order to do so).""<p>Doh, yes Selenium Grid uses Selenium.  And the argument about no major JS using Selenium is not an argument to not use it.<p>""It isn't able to test against non-desktop machines. Each server must be running a daemon to handle the batches of jobs - this leaves mobile devices out of the picture.""<p>Unless you write the appropriate daemon for those devices and integrate it into the existing Selenium Grid set up.  Surely that's easier than starting afresh?<p>""It can't test against unknown browsers. Each browser needs special code to hook in to triggering the loading of the browser by Selenium, thus an unknown browser (such IE 8, Opera 10, Firefox Nightly, or Chrome) may not be able to run.'<p>Huh?  That's just bizarre.  If you've got some new browser then teach Selenium how to start it. It's not that hard.<p>""And most importantly: Selenium Grid requires that you actually own and control a number of machines on which you can run your tests. It's not always feasible, especially in the world of distributed Open Source JavaScript development, to have the finances to have dedicated machines running non-stop. A more cost effective solution is required.""<p>This is solved by virtualization.",1237567958

Would you like to see my .emacs file?<p>All kiding aside, the most important thing about an editor is an ability to customize it, whether it be via Emacs Lisp, Vim Script, or some other means.  No software developer or plugin writer is going to be able to anticipate your needs, instead give yourself the ability to fulfil them.<p>For example, just recently I wrote up a quick Emacs Lisp function to allow me to toggle between header files and source files for C/C++.  I'll add a recursive search (to account for more complex project layouts with /inc and /src) after exams.<p><a href=""http://paste.lisp.org/display/77348"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paste.lisp.org/display/77348</a><p>For those that think learning to customize an editor takes too long, learning to program takes even longer.  You'll learn how to make your editor do anything you want longer before you become an excellent programmer.  Textmate and textmate like editors are great shortcuts, but probably crutches in the long run.  That being said, Textmate does anticipates the average programmer's needs suprisignly well out of the box, so in that sense it fills a niche.",1237567718

525151,comment,524956,524956,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Where do you see yourself in this dichotomy of ""measure everything"" versus ""subjective considerations are important, too""?<p>As pointed out elsewhere in these comments, Apple represents something like the opposite prioritization of Google.  The argument for ""subjective"" design is that it is impossible to build up a good, coherent design by testing out each aspect empirically then putting all those things together.  Consider the classic Slashdot review of iPod: ""No wireless. Less space than a nomad. Lame.""  The consideration of each aspect in isolation missed the design trade offs that made the iPod great overall.<p>I suppose Google misses out on that, but it's not clear that they or their users care.  I do think, though, that Google has a unique approach to usability.  Which is ""Here's a box.  Type some stuff in, and we'll figure out what to do with it.""  Google ""search"" is actually several different applications, and Google routes to the ones it thinks best suit what you typed.  Chrome's single address/search bar follows this philosophy.<p>It's interesting to think that what distinguishes Apple and Google, more so than the product spaces they operate in, are the balance of empirical and subjective factors in their engineering cultures.",1237567506

Even the mighty Microsoft follows a stratified talent pool system. They have 2 companies / teams here. The one that builds their products is called Microsoft R&D and the people there are _GOOD_. Whereas all their global internal IT systems needs are supported by Microsoft IT Services, which is staffed by simpler developers who are not good enough to contribute to products, but can cut all the HTML needed as well as make all the CURD applications that the business operations need.<p>Indian IT companies are no different, they have a small cadre of excellent developers, who form the core of their teams, and are very busy -- even now.
The rest of the millions are poor developers, not algorithmically sound, but can make simple CURD applications.<p>Its this second layer that fills up the benches.

As the room warms up (and gets brighter), you'll naturally wake up less groggily.<p>If your schedule can handle it, try just going to sleep when you are tired and seeing when you wake up (ie. don't use an alarm at all).<p>I tried this for about six months, and the following happened.<p>The first week or two I slept upwards of 10-11 hours a night, and woke up in the afternoon.<p>The next couple months, my schedule kind of rotated around the clock (I'd wake up about 30-45 mins later each day), but I only slept 8-9 hours.<p>By month four, I was only sleeping 7-7.5 hours at a time, and my schedule rotation had slowed to where it was only shifting about 15 mins a day.<p>The best part was that I always woke up extremely fresh and ready to go. I never felt like the walking dead, and generally was happier.<p>Before I tried this, I thought I was a night person, just because I always seem to stay up too late and dislike waking up... but I realized what I really liked was the quiet, and found that early morning quiet time (4-7am) was actually more productive, just because I wasn't worn out from a whole day of being awake.<p>Sadly I had to return to a day job for a bit before grad school, so now I survive mostly on coffee, but it was fun to try when I had the chance.",1237566119
525107,comment,524956,524956,0,0,tdonia,,,"Design, for me, is about evoking interesting stories.  Data is an excellent tool for honing those stories but data alone isn't that compelling.  Much of Google's success has been reliant on utilitarian pages that are designed to redirect users to other places - functionality which often calls for very subtle design treatments.  The frustrations i've felt with their user experience is that frequently the details are smart but they miss the big elements connecting their tools into a coherent story.  Ever use gmail with igoogle?  or attempt to share your google reader with a friend who isn't already in your addressbook?  these disconnects eventually add up & it sounds like they lack a system for coherently addressing the gestalt of their overall user experience.<p>A visual designer friend pointed me to an Einstein quote that i think sums up the frustration of collaboration that occurs with a purely data based approach quite well:<p>""Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Human beings are incredibly slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. Together they are powerful beyond imagination.""<p>They've got the fast, accurate & stupid down very well.

I wasn't the greatest at it, but I was in the position to learn and grow my skillset and not have people upset at me for getting things in late or asking questions... rather they were excited because I was learning and saw the potential I saw in myself. Needless to say, I wasn't working there too much longer, for personal reasons. However, I missed the job like no other. I had finally found a job I could truly love.<p>After that, with the economy the way it has been, I bounced from a tree care company (working with a friend, not so terrible) to a fast food restaurant (horrible, never again) and then to a call center providing tech support for Blackberry phones to people who under other circumstances should seriously find a twelve step program for their addiction to those damned devices. Bouncing around, I thought I would never get the opportunity I once had. I missed it terribly and pined for it regularly.<p>And then I found it. After two weeks working part time as a contractor, I was asked to leave my job because they (my new employer) knew they could provide me with enough work and I was doing better than they expected as far as quality of work and timeliness of delivery were concerned. I didn't give it a second thought. I hate not working with the web. I am totally and thoroughly enamored by this technology and know that if I could stay in this career field I will be happy.<p>The point is... do what you love.

Think fabs to make the chips, the various motors and related electronics, coating processes, and then sending them off to the places that make HP/Dell/etc systems.  If just the drive factory were moved then you'd still have the drive parts crossing the ocean to get to the US and the completed drives crossing once again to go back into the systems.<p>Usually the relocations happen when a disruptive solution comes along.  You get the advantage of a somewhat clean sheet.  For example SSDs don't need all the mechanical components and fine tuning, so they can be made with a completely different supply chain.<p>It won't happen in hard drives but for other products customization is what can spur relocation.  For example Lenovo is opening a manufacturing plant in the US to deal with customization which allows quicker response times.  (Customized orders often can charge a little more which offsets increased costs.)",1349819515

My main issue with it is that pushing and pulling takes considerably more time, from 20-30 seconds for plain linear commits up to many minutes if there are merges involved. It's not a showstopper for me (especially considering the alternative of working with git direcrly) but I can see it being more problematic for people that tend to push on every commit.<p>My workaround is to also keep a local git mirror (git clone --mirror) and push through it:<p><pre><code>    ~/repo$ hg push ~/repo.git
    ~/repo$ cd ~/repo.git
    ~/repo.git$ git push upstream

I've been noticing the resurgence of browser-based resizing of large images on a few different business blogs/formats, recently.  In this case (and some others), the resize is to much less than 1/4 the original, so I'm thinking it's not a ""Retina"" thing.<p>Maybe it's just convenience for the company/blogger, not bothering to resize.  But then, every access is a 2+ MB hit -- which is how I noticed it -- both for you, and for the viewer, which may particularly impact mobile viewers and others on limited bandwidth connections.",1349819451

Your compiler error tells you early about something that would've become a problem later on.

Your missed deadlines mean that you didn't know enough about the project to estimate accurately before, so now you have more information about its true scope.

And checking a long string of matrix multiplications to see if they intuitively make sense (shouldn't everything intuitively make sense?) is especially aggravating when you constantly have to interrupt your intuition to switch to a rote calculation.<p>I never thought to think of the columns of B as vectors that physically travel through A; to think of a dataflow or pipeline from right to left on the page.

But your outrage is not misplaced -- knowingly mishandling mail is not simply excused because e-mail is already insecure.<p>> ... it's sloppy and too many people take the easy way out instead of being professional.<p>My defense of the ""many inboxes forwarding to one"" scenario was not meant to cover every perceivable scenario. Obviously I would not advocate it in all situations and many situations would not be appropriate for that. If someone does not set it up right, I am not trying to defend that sloppiness.<p>An example of a good fit: someone who works part time at several companies, or the sole proprietor of a few businesses.

4633950,comment,4633163,4633163,50,0,grellas,,,"A few points:<p>1. The <i>CLS Bank v. Alice</i> case, though raising an issue of vital importance, is not about ""whether software is patentable.""<p>2. Over the years, the Federal Circuit has notoriously broadened the scope of patent eligibility, most conspicuously in its 1998 <i>State Street</i> decision which essentially opened the floodgates to the modern rush of business method patents by holding that virtually any business method was patentable so long as ""it produces a useful, concrete and tangible result."" In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the <i>Bilski</i> case, repudiated the <i>State Street</i> test for patent eligibility and, though upholding software and business method patents generally, directed courts to be much more vigilant to ensure that no one gain patent rights to what are mere ""abstract ideas,"" however much they may incidentally be tied to some computer mechanism in their implementation. In a follow on decision (<i>Prometheus</i>), the U.S. Supreme Court similarly cut back sharply on the permissible scope of patent eligibility for claimed inventions that constituted nothing more than laws of nature.<p>3. In this <i>CLS Bank</i> case, the claimed patent involves a method for eliminating certain types of risk associated with an escrow closing and used a technological process by which to mimic a phantom version of the closing as a security check before allowing the real transaction to close. In essence, the technological aspect of this ""invention"" is routine and so the question is whether anything beyond that is simply another way of trying to patent nothing more than an abstract idea. If so, it should fail under <i>Bilski</i>; if not, it would potentially pass the test for patent eligibility.<p>4. The lower court in <i>CLS Bank</i> held as a matter of law that the ""invention"" was nothing more than an abstract idea and held it invalid as being ineligible for patent protection. On appeal, a divided panel of the Federal Circuit reversed and reinstated the patent. It did so, however, by setting out a brand new procedural rule whose effect would be to gut much of <i>Bilski</i> and reopen the floodgates to huge numbers of business method patents under a very loose standard - to wit, by holding, that, if it ""is not <i>manifestly evident</i> [my emphasis] that a claim is directed to a patent ineligible abstract idea,"" then the court essentially treat the claim as eligible. What the Federal Circuit panel did, then, was to take the Supreme Court's directive for lower courts to be much <i>stricter</i> in evaluating dubious business method patents for patent eligibility and recast that directive in a form that said, <i>if</i> you as a court see that something is obviously nothing more than an abstract idea, then go ahead and reject it but you are otherwise to treat as being eligible for patent protection. In other words, the new strictness found in <i>Bilski</i> for evaluating such claims was once again to be transformed by the Federal Circuit into a loose standard that would let such claims coast by unimpeded.<p>5. Of course, this has set off alarm bells because, in effect, it represents yet one more revolt by the Federal Circuit against attempts by the Supreme Court to rein it in by bringing patent issues back to some semi-sane state. Following the panel decision (which was rendered over a sharp and stinging dissent), the losing party petitioned for a rehearing <i>en banc</i> (meaning by the full panoply of Federal Circuit judges as opposed to merely a 3-judge panel) and this was granted. Thus, we shall see whether the Federal Circuit is prepared once again to stick its thumb in the eye of the Supreme Court or whether it will temper its extreme pro-patent proclivities and follow the law as it has been directed.<p>So, this is a very important case affecting the trend of patent enforcement in a profound way but does nothing to challenge the idea of software or business methods being patentable in a general sense. For anything to change in that regard, Congress must act.",1349816872

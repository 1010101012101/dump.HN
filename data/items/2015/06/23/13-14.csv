This isn&#x27;t about you.<p>Nearly all of the comments in this thread are extremely negative - ranging from hand-wavy about how valuable mobile is to expressing excitement that &quot;[dumb] people will [again] be leaving the Internet.&quot; What an incredibly pessimistic and self-centric way of viewing the world.<p>The incredible thing about a supercomputer that fits in your hand isn&#x27;t that we&#x27;re putting them in the hand of hackers who went to MIT 40 years ago. It&#x27;s not exciting for someone who was going to be sitting behind a Linux terminal anyway. This pretty much changes nothing for them.<p>But it changes <i>everything</i> for the kid in sub-Saharan Africa who has never had access to a computer. It changes <i>everything</i> for my friend&#x27;s family in Iran - none of them ever had a computer, and now <i>all</i> of them have a smartphone.<p>It even changes everything for my father-in-law - a hay farmer who had little interest in using a computer, but inexplicably loves his iPad. He takes it out to the farm and performs what I would consider the most trivial of computing tasks, but it&#x27;s something he never did before, even when PCs were cheap and ubiquitous and I spent hour after hour teaching him how to scroll and double-click.<p>Of course, hackers are right: That smartphone is not be as good at editing photos as your 15-inch Macbook Pro. And it&#x27;s a horror to write code from. But, to borrow an analogy from Peter Thiel, the difference between editing photos on your phone and editing them on a computer may be a move from 1 to n for hackers. Hackers, who have been at n for years, are rational in not caring. For this Iranian family, and for my father-in-law, however, this is a move from 0 to 1.  And that&#x27;s a big deal.<p>Are the operating systems more closed than hackers would like them to be? Yes. But my friend&#x27;s family in Iran has neither the interest nor the ability to hack on the kernel of some mobile operating system, so they don&#x27;t really care. Is it harder for them to type on a phone than it is on a keyboard? Of course, but now they&#x27;re typing <i>something</i>. It works, and they&#x27;re using it, and that&#x27;s a <i>big, big deal</i>.<p>This isn&#x27;t necessarily a revolution of what it&#x27;s possible to do with computers, but a revolution of <i>who</i> can do things with computers. We&#x27;ll soon be reaching economies of scale we could never imagine. Access, where there previously was none.<p>That you can call an Uber because it&#x27;s in your pocket and happens to include GPS, in my mind, is just a side-benefit.",1435067869

9764610,comment,9762285,9763768,0,0,gjm11,,,"(See the sibling comment with a &quot;10.&quot; in it for context.)<p>7. <i>Seventeen Sudoku Clues</i>. OK, this one is easy to describe :-). The question is how few clues a Sudoku puzzle can have while still having a unique solution. The answer is 17. A bunch of 17-clue puzzles had already been found, so the &quot;only&quot; thing left to do was to prove that 16 clues never suffice. The proof was basically a big computer search, but with some clever innovations to make the search manageable. So the first step was to find all possible completed Sudoku grids. Someone else had already done that. It turns out that there are only about 5 billion &quot;genuinely different&quot; fully-solved Sudoku grids. So now all you have to do (ha!) is to check, for each fully-solved grid, every set of 16 clues, and verify that none leads to a unique solution. Of course this is ridiculously too big a search, and that&#x27;s where the cleverness comes in.<p>So, given a completed grid, you can identify some &quot;unavoidable sets&quot;, sets of cells such that <i>any</i> solvable puzzle must include one clue from each such set. (They looked for unavoidable sets of size <=12.) And then you can find &quot;hitting sets&quot;, sets of size 16 that intersect every one of these unavoidable sets that&#x27;s been found. Any solvable 16-clue puzzle would need to have its clues form a hitting set. But something could be a hitting set and not a solvable puzzle, so once you&#x27;ve found all the hitting sets you have a bit of checking to do.<p>And the cleverness lies in finding good ways of finding (enough) unavoidable sets, good heuristic ways of finding all the hitting sets (this problem is NP-complete in general), and efficient ways of testing each hitting set found to see whether it gives a puzzle with a unique solution.<p>There are other mathematical tasks that can be formulated in terms of hitting sets (the paper by McGuire, Tugemann and Civario claims this is true for various problems in computational biology, software testing, databases, etc.); I don&#x27;t know to what extent their ideas are actually applicable to any of those domains.",1435067751

The few criminologists who have thus far investigated the phenomenon estimate that the overall rate for convicted felons as a whole is between 2 percent and 8 percent...&quot;)<p>So between 92% and 98% of the time, plea bargaining gets things right. The &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; jury trial standard is unlikely to be more than 95% and is in practice probably 90% or lower: <a href=""http://federaltaxcrimes.blogspot.com/2014/09/proof-beyond-reasonable-doubt-ramblings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://federaltaxcrimes.blogspot.com/2014/09/proof-beyond-re...</a>. So if the 2-8% error rate is correct, it&#x27;s not clear that plea bargaining leads to more innocent people being convicted than jury trials.<p>Moreover, it&#x27;s unclear to me that you can do much better than 90-95% accuracy. Say you set the threshold at 99.9%, only convicting when the proof is overwhelming. What would be your rate of false negatives (i.e. where you let a guilty person go)? And how would society react to that? There&#x27;s a false negative rate beyond which people will push back on the court system as being too lenient on the accused. You can already see this in areas of the law where proof is difficult. For example, I think the crazy administrative proceedings for rape cases in college campuses arose, in part, because of the difficulty of holding guilty people accountable in the court system.",1435067747

The so-called &quot;finite algebraic formula&quot; of Ono and Bruinier is only more &quot;finite&quot;, &quot;algebraic&quot; or &quot;formula&quot; in a very artificial, press-release-exaggerated sense.<p>Sort of like claiming that any of the contorted &quot;prime formulas&quot; that various people have come up with (<a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeFormulas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeFormulas.html</a>) provide a better finite description of the primes than the good old sieve of Eratosthenes.<p>Now, this comparison is not quite fair. Unlike those prime formulas, the Ono-Bruinier result is actually mathematically significant in that it does give you more information about the partition numbers. It&#x27;s a nice result, but is it more interesting than hundreds of other interesting results in mathematics in the last 5ish years? Even if we just look at the extremely narrow field of mathematics that is the study of partition numbers, there are other nice recent achivements such as Radu&#x27;s proof of Subbarao&#x27;s conjecture.<p>Ono is certainly an excellent mathematician, but he might be even more excellent at getting extreme amounts of publicity for his results. I don&#x27;t want to give the impression that I&#x27;m sour about this. On the contrary, I think it&#x27;s awesome that mathematics can get this kind of publicity, and Ono earned it (other mathematicians should learn from his example!), but it&#x27;s something to keep in mind.<p>Likewise, about HOTT. It&#x27;s very promising, but is it really an &quot;achivement&quot; yet? Who knows, the hype could turn out to be justified.

We mostly just played outdoor sports and games, did arts and crafts, and more often than not, just sorta screwed around because we were kids and it was fun to screw around and play with stuff.  I never pursued a career in any of the things I played with back then but I did learn to interact with other kids and participate in some fun activities.

You can leave your TV off for an entire month, or tuned to a channel for 24x7x365 - zero difference in cost to the provider, or impact to other people on the service.<p>&quot;Making too many local calls&quot; - More than one person has been required to purchase a business line when they overused their local calling privileges.  Indeed, on some CO to CO trunks, if enough people (ab)used their local calling privileges, the entire exchange would be blocked and <i>nobody</i> could call in/out.   Unlike the case of internet connectivity, there is no graceful fallback - once the trunk reaches capacity, it&#x27;s dead for anyone else.  (Lumby, BC to Vernon, BC - used to happen all the time - 48 people could bring down a town of 1800).  That&#x27;s why those types of deployments require some type of per minute charges to avoid that scenario.<p>&quot;If it causes degradation for other users, that&#x27;s the fault of the ISP that has over-overprovisioned us&quot; - We totally agree here.  Any ISP selling unlimited service, and not clearly explaining how many gigabytes &quot;Unlimited&quot; equals, is doing everyone a disservice.<p>&quot;Caps are just a way to squeeze out higher profits by reducing the necessity of upgrading infrastructure.&quot; - We disagree here.  ISPs should provide Caps to their customers, and clearly communicate what they are - <i>and then compete to provide higher caps while ensuring they maintain the line rate they&#x27;ve committed to their customers.</i><p>For example, if I&#x27;ve purchased a 1 Gigabit connection, the ISP darn well better invest in their infrastructure to make sure that <i>none</i> of their ports are blocking.  Comcast utterly failed to do that with Netflix recently, and I find that annoying beyond belief.  At the same time though, I don&#x27;t expect Comcast to provision enough capacity to support all of their customers at 1 Gigabit (or whatever a high speed connection is) at the same time - that&#x27;s cost prohibitive - particularly as it will rarely be happening.<p>On the Big I internet, this is solved by what&#x27;s called 95th percentile billing.  This is probably too confusing for the average user, so something simpler like, &quot;You get a 1 Gigabit connection for $75/month, with a 10 Terabyte/month Limit during Peak hours, and Unlimited Terabyte limit in Off peak hours, $20/addition Terabyte in Peak, and we make sure that none of our upstream ports our blocked on any of our peering routers&quot;  is exactly what I&#x27;d be looking for.",1435066906

I&#x27;ve not used Flash for about 10 years, and never really missed it. The most common use of Flash these days is for video players, which is the easiest use-case to work around since it doesn&#x27;t actually require any Flash-specific capabilities; wget and VLC are a fine replacement, and the URLs can be extracted using Firefox addons, greasemonkey scripts, commandline tools, digging around in Firebug, or just Googling around to find an alternative source. I don&#x27;t know about videos on facebook.com, since I&#x27;ve never had reason to visit that site.<p>&quot;Real&quot; uses of Flash (like newgrounds.com which I used to visit obsessively) are basically impossible to work around. None of the FOSS reimplementations (LightSpark, Gnash, swfdec, etc.) is any good, although swfdec seemed the least-bad in my experience. On the other hand, such usage is rarely critical. There are very few &quot;giant Flash file&quot; sites around these days, and most of those that used to exist could be either safely ignored (eg. games) or worked around (eg. emailing the owner to obtain whatever info you need).",1435066898

The thread quoted and linked on Jun 17 goes over more details.

9764489,comment,9762285,9763768,0,0,gjm11,,,"(See the sibling comment with a &quot;10.&quot; in it for context.)<p>8. <i>Ngô Bảo Châu’s proof of the Fundamental Lemma</i>. This is a big one but I&#x27;m not sure I can say anything useful about it, but let&#x27;s see if I can get maybe 0.1% of the way towards doing so. So, we are interested in prime numbers, and there&#x27;s a powerful way of investigating how they&#x27;re distributed that&#x27;s based on something called the Riemann zeta function. For some values of its argument, you can compute zeta(s) as the sum of this series: zeta(s) = 1/1^s + 1/2^s + 1/3^s + 1/4^s + etc. Euler noticed that you can factorize this as the product of 1/(1-1/p^s), where p ranges over all prime numbers, and &quot;morally&quot; this is why it&#x27;s related to the distribution of the primes. You can use this -- with a lot of fascinating but difficult technical stuff along the way -- to prove the &quot;prime number theorem&quot;, which says that the number of primes <= x is about x/log(x). Now, suppose you&#x27;re wondering about a subset of the primes; e.g., the ones that, when you divide them by 4, leave a remainder of 1. Then you might compute the same product, but only over those primes; or, conversely, only over the primes that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. (There is exactly one prime that falls into neither of these categories. It isn&#x27;t hard to find.) Thinking along these lines leads you (if you&#x27;re clever enough) to what are called &quot;Dirichlet L-series&quot;: a(1)/1^s + a(2)/2^s + a(3)/3^s + ... where the sequence a(1),a(2),... has a particular form. And you can use these to prove a generalization of the prime number theorem that tells you, e.g., that the number of primes <= x that are 1 mod 4 is about 1/2 x/log(x).<p>These sequences a(k) are periodic modulo some integer (e.g., the one you need to discriminate between primes that are 1 and 3 mod 4 has period 4). You can think of them as being associated with &quot;the integers modulo k&quot;, which is an &quot;abelian group&quot; (which very crudely means something in which you can do addition and subtraction and have the results make some kind of sense). Associated with other abelian groups there are other L-series-like things called &quot;automorphic L-functions&quot;. And these things are (kinda-sorta) the subject of the so-called &quot;Langlands program&quot;, which sketches -- the details even of the conjectures involved are in many cases not clearly understood -- relationships between lots of objects in pure mathematics that I haven&#x27;t yet said enough even to define: automorphic forms (related to automorphic L-functions), group representations, etc. And all these things have intimate connections with the prime numbers (as I kinda sketched above), and with other number-theoretic things (e.g., the proof of Fermat&#x27;s last theorem makes use of ideas of this sort).<p>One of the conjectures in the Langlands program is the &quot;fundamental lemma&quot;. I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you what it is, I&#x27;m afraid, but it&#x27;s important and now it&#x27;s been proved :-).<p>What&#x27;s next: decades more chipping away at the Langlands program, bringing gradually more understanding of number theory, algebraic geometry, and related areas of mathematics.",1435066504

There&#x27;s an assumption often made amongst geeks and hackers that we&#x27;ll know when we create the first &quot;true&quot; AI. I thoroughly enjoyed <i>Her</i>, because the movie didn&#x27;t delve in to the &quot;who and how&quot; details of the AI. If we strip away the assumption that we&#x27;ll know when we create the first true AI, then the film&#x27;s circumstances make much more sense.<p>Think about how applications like Siri work today. They have a very superficial appearance of AI, but they&#x27;re not terribly convincing. Apple is making progress though. Siri surprises me all the time; in a good way. Periodically, I&#x27;ll try something new; and occasionally, Siri delivers. It&#x27;s progressive enhancement.<p>Fast-forward 25-50 years. Where is the line between what we have today and &quot;true&quot; AI? I keep quoting the word true because I believe the phrase &quot;true AI&quot; is apocryphal in the way the author uses it. True AI can mean many things. Two possibilities are:<p>1) We gain some deeper insight in to the mechanics of human consciousness, and set out to replicate that in software. When we achieve that, we&#x27;ve achieved &quot;true AI&quot;.<p>2) We never really understand human consciousness, but we keep chasing the goal of <i>convincing</i> AI. That is, AI that <i>seems</i> human. In this chase, we achieve a convincing enough level of AI that the questions raised in the article — and in the movie — become relevant.<p>I believe the latter is a more likely scenario than the former.<p>Looking forward 25-50 years again, let&#x27;s examine a future where Megacorp™ keeps iterating their AI product. Samantha could be just another major (vis a vis SemVer) release. In Megacorp&#x27;s testing, the AI was very convincing, and they believed they had a leg up on the competition. They hadn&#x27;t realized just how effective their new software was though. In testing, the software&#x27;s access was limited to the sandbox of the testing environment, which used samples of information. Once released on to the Internet, with access to a vast number of connections and information, the software reaches levels of convincingness (a proxy for intelligence) that the authors hadn&#x27;t anticipated.<p><pre><code>    ...but that doesn’t change the fact that we’ve spent all our time\n    mired in the world view of a neurotic middle class man whose only\n    real problems, and only real interest, are his dysfunctional\n    romantic relationships. Jonze has taken what would in truth be a\n    revolutionary event in human history and shrunk it down to an\n    episode of Dr. Phil.\n\n</code></pre>\nI hate to be so cynical, but have a look at the world around us. Wouldn&#x27;t it be so perfectly human of us (as a society on the whole) to overlook the emergence of true AI while we ponder our navel? That is exactly the type of complication that Samantha is referring to. We have the capacity for rationality, but we&#x27;re not 100% rational. That&#x27;s what makes us human. That is, IMO, a major theme of <i>Her</i>.<p>PS - I am 100% certain that somewhere in the societal background, there is a Hacker News that exists in the world of <i>Her</i>. This community identified that this new software was a &quot;game changer&quot; early on, and many arguments ensued with regard to how this new AI will impact the world.

This meant that old code could still be passed references to <i>new</i> generic collections and work as expected.<p>The only constraint in C# is that is &quot;old&quot; code has taken a strong dependency on an old non-generic <i>class</i> you cannot pass a new generic class to that code.",1435064943

But they did hand us a long list of formatting requirements (precise margins, contents format, lots of other details) and it was clear that any deviation from those would result in your thesis being handed right back to you.<p>Fortunately, there was a LaTeX style file that had been handed around the physics department for years that generations of grad students had tuned to meet the requirements. Doing my part, I tweaked it a bit to handle some special cases that came up in my thesis (and, I think, to clean up the code in one or two places) and passed it on to the next generation. (I shudder to think of how many forks there must have been; I saw at least two or three while I was preparing my version. Maybe someone has put a canonical version on GitHub by now: nothing of the sort was really on our radar back then.)",1435064622

The government administers estates owned by the royal family and takes the revenue - the net cash flow is about £100M annually from Lizzie and crew to the UK taxpayer. This isn&#x27;t soft measures like &quot;enhances tourism&quot;. It&#x27;s direct income from the estates.<p>If the UK gummint were to cut them off, the Windsors could take back control of their estates, and the gummint would be that much in the red. Continuing in the vein of intellectual consistency, the UK is a representative democracy - the people who pass law are voted in by citizens. The monarch does not make law, so elections for the monarch are meaningless in the context of law- or policy-making.<p>You can hate on the royal family all you want, but it doesn&#x27;t change that they contribute more financially than they get, and they don&#x27;t get to make law. And the UK has a multipolar political system, though it&#x27;s stupid FPTP voting method gives it a lot of similarities to a two-party system. Ultimately though, your hated royals actually inhabit a country with more political choices for the proles than the US has.<p>King of Sweden... I&#x27;m less familiar with.",1435064617

I probably could have fought my charges a little more, but the risk outweighed the reward. You go to trial and anything can happen. Was I 100% innocent, no. Was I 100% guilty, no. But because at the time I was arrested my co-defendant had disappeared (I believe he is still wanted but I have never followed up and the past is the past to me) the focus of the prosecutor at that moment in time was squarely on me. The prosecutors offered me a plea that was almost too good to turn down. Looking back, and after talking to a bunch of people, I probably should not have taken the plea, but you can&#x27;t go through life second guessing your decisions.<p>Knowing what I know now, IMO, the better your plea deal the less confident the prosecutor feels about the case. I was looking at a minimum 10 year sentence. I took a plea for one year supervised probation. I took the plea for several reasons. First, going to trial would have cost me at bare minimum $50,000-60,000 in attorney costs (contrary to popular belief your ability to obtain a public defender is based on your income, and assets you have access to, and I did not qualify). As it was I had already spent close to $12,000 on attorneys. The second reason I chose the plea over trial was that going to trial would have been a long, drawn out process where the result may or may not have gone in my favor. You are putting your life in the hands of a judge or jury. In the end my decision to take the plea boiled down to cost and knowing that within 1 year I would be done with everything and could move on with my life. If I had gone to trial, it would have cost a lot more and at the time I was finishing probation I would probably just be going to court. I took it as an easy way to lick my wounds, learn from my experience, and put my life back on track quickly.<p>Funny side story of it all. When I first started discussing costs with my attorney I asked him what his thought was on total costs. He replied that there were two questions he had for me in determining cost. First, did I want him to play golf with both the judge and the prosecutor, or just the prosecutor. And, the second question was how many games of golf I wanted him to play with them. I laughed and told him as many as it takes. Looking back part of me thinks he may not have been joking. Our legal system is full of I&#x27;ll scratch your back, you scratch mine scenarios.",1435064615

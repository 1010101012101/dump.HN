I find it easy to conveice of a multidimensional reputation, eg your HN karma encapsulates one vector, the number of upvotes on Reddit or some special-interest forum another, and so forth. The bit I don&#x27;t fully understand right now is how you approach convertibility.<p>Say I&#x27;m into motorcycles, and I am a regular at motorcycle-forums.com where I dispense helpful advice on everything from tire pressure to tappets. Over time I deservedly acquire a reputation as That Helpful Guy, and the grateful votes of other users accumulate. One day I decide I want a new bike, and head over to the marketplace subforum to purchase one. Turns out that Alica has just the bike I want! Naturally I want to use my accrued Biker Points to get a discount.<p>Now, in a closed economy. Alice might be delighted to have my BP - she could trade them for other goods and services with other bikers, and there might even be a social value in having dealt with me (a good few specialist websites maintain informal &#x27;trusted buyer/seller&#x27; lists which saves members money vs. low-trust high-fee markets like eBay). But what if Alice is done with biking and just wants to get rid of her Vroomatic 5000 so she can take up windsurfing or something? My BP will be of little use to her on the ocean wave, and there may not be enough transitional activity between the Biker and surfer communitites to establish a maingful rate of exchange, so instead you end up with a bunch of shady pseudocurrencies, sort of like penny stocks.<p>One way I can see it working is if quality websites charge a small joining or membership fee and a portion of that constitutes an initial pool of points. Alternatively, a portion of ad revenue might be convertible into points, as those members who consistently make valuable and informative contributions are a key part of the site&#x27;s draw, so it makes sense for the operator to subsidize the most &#x27;productive&#x27; members.<p>I may have got completely the wrong end of the stick here, and you only meant to substitute reputation for cryptographic proof-of-work, but I&#x27;m guessing form your slides about inequality and different concepts of value that you&#x27;re looking to examine the notion of wealth in more subjective contexts, rather than just authentication.",1405727384

For example, service can get spotty in underground parking structures (common in LA) making it impossible to text someone nearby to ask &quot;where did you park?&quot;  Another place that has bad reception is Disneyland.  There are no towers inside the park and the berm that separates the park from the city of Anaheim seems to block out signals pretty well, so this device would help groups keep in contact there.<p>While traveling, two places that come to mind where cell reception is nonexistant would be hiking in the mountains or while at sea.

8056042,comment,8052599,8053325,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Not just ownership, but rights in general, and even worse: the concept of individual independence and empowerment.<p>There has been a consistent trend to portray the digital/online realm as a world apart from the &quot;real&quot; world, rather than, as is the truth, just another facet of it. This has facilitated massive erosions of civil liberties in the online world. Government censorship is the norm on the internet, not the exception. Warrantless monitoring and trespass on private systems and data by the government and law enforcement is also rampant, with few safeguards. In a similar vein, the protections of the rule of law and the criminal justice system are completely thrown out the window in many circumstances when it comes to the online realm. You can be effectively punished online merely due to an allegation (i.e. DMCA takedown), and often only arbitration is available as a remedy, erasing centuries of traditional protection for individual rights through the court system.<p>And that&#x27;s aside from the ongoing war over DRM and the desire of major content aggregators to deny ownership rights and privileges to customers.<p>Add to that the growing reliance on paternalistic relationships with large corporations and business entities, eroding individualism. People rely on their ISPs and their cell carriers for access to the online world, a major aspect of modern business and private life. Unlike phone service these service providers have much greater leeway to decide what you can and cannot do online and have increasingly taken advantage of consumers. People rely on major services (gmail, hotmail, facebook, twitter, etc.) for their primary means of communication, services that in many cases border on unregulated monopolies. And at work people are increasingly dependent on their employers to provide medical and dental coverage, retirement savings, and so forth.",1405724741

Why would trafficking in sex workers be more exposed to trafficking than any other kind of slavery, except because it is illegal in most places?

I thought the whole point of feminism was to see and treat women as agents with the same self determination as men have - so why are you reducing sex workers to simply their body and gender?<p>And yes, some women are forced into prostitution.

(It&#x27;s a lot easier to learn something quickly if you have someone around who already knows a lot about it.)  And people who both know a lot and learn quickly are expensive and rare, so I expect the optimal hiring process would look for a large percentage of relatively inexperienced fast learners, along with a small (but non-zero) percentage of more experienced people, even if they aren&#x27;t likely to develop as quickly.

I actually really enjoyed the &quot;script format&quot; type presentation more than I thought I would when I first staerted reading it. Having the article be a conversation between two (and more) people helped to explain various aspects of the topic (just as a conversation would normally digress), without getting &quot;single speaker fatigue&quot; as I often get when listening to a traditional lecture. Instead each character had their own voice and personality. The incidental details also helped me picture the scene as if it really were a movie, and brought the content to life in a way simply reading a standard article description would not.<p>I think this could also be interesting to see in an actually filmed format, and could be applicable to more topics than just security/cryptography. Maybe instead of &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot; we could have &quot;Computer Scientists in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;.<p>Right now it seems like most of the video content about this field is in either the single lecturer/presenter format, the interview format, or the unscripted Q&A panel format, but I have not seen many (or even any) multicharacter scripted pieces, as the original article presented. It seems like there is room to innovate in this space. Your &quot;characters&quot; could each have different concerns, and their contribution to the topic discussion would be scripted explain the topic in terms of their &quot;personality&quot; (the performance junky, the &quot;paranoid&quot; security person, etc). I&#x27;m just talking off the top of my head here, so I&#x27;m sure there are some more interesting ways to run with this concept.<p>If anyone has actually done something like this, I would appreciate if someone could reply with link or some more information about that project.

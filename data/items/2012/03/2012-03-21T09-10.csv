3733692,comment,3730028,3730028,16,0,patio11,,,"Congrats on the success here.  You asked for some suggestions in the blog post.  I'm going to make them publicly for the benefit of other HNers but if you want rationales and don't want the followup public just find my email.<p>1)  Strongly, strongly consider capturing CCs at signup.  Yes, this takes a bit more work.  Yes, this will decrease your conversion rate.  However, you're going to get more people successfully charged than you do currently.<p>2)  There exist things you can do to increase user engagement with the app which will increase conversion rate from ""user"" to ""signup"", even if you don't take advice #1.  I have a video coming out in a little while about this.  Short version: go take the free trial of Balsamiq Mockups and take copious notes about what they do.  In particular, note how Balsamiq doesn't start you out with a blank screen and note the timing and frequency of prompts for you to signup.  Implement both of those things.  Your conversion rate will increase.<p>3)  You captured my email address for a ""paid"" signup.  Good!  I got no email from you.  Bad!  You should, bare minimum, hit my inbox with ""Thanks for signing up for Codiqa.  Your free trial lasts until XX/YY."" followed by the best three bullet point sales copy you can come up with, linking back to your site extensively.  Why?  Because I already forgot your domain name (literally true) and statistically speaking I already forgot I signed up for Codiqa.  Hitting my inbox is a free chance at recapturing my attention tomorrow when I do my morning email pass.<p>4)  But wait, if one email is good, isn't five emails better?  YES!  Put a wee little checkbox on your signup form saying ""Can we email you a free course about JQuery mobile?  Five emails, absolutely no spam, opt out any time.""  You'll get 40%+ signups.  If they sign up, you hit them on day 0, day 6, day 15, day 20, and day 28 with emails of approximately the following format.<p><i>Thanks for signing up for a free month-long course on JQuery Mobile by Codiqa, the jQuery mobile design app you used recently.  (You asked for this when you signed up.  Don't want it?  No problem, click here.)  This is your 2nd email out of 5.  Today's topic is how jQuery mobile cuts app development costs while increasing revenue.<p>(h2) jQuery Mobile Cuts Development Costs by 50% (/h2)<p>Paragraph of copy. (~300 words)  Link to codiqa docs or blog in here somewhere.<p>(h2) Another bullet point (/h2)<p>Another paragraph.<p>(h2) Another bullet point (/h2)<p>Another paragraph<p>Conclusion paragraph goes here.  Early in the email sequence the conclusion paragraph just mentions your service, establishes expectations for the next email, and invites them to email you at any time.  Later in the sequence you get salesy as heck.</i><p>What does salesy as heck mean?  By the fifth email you should, if you're good at writing and jQuery Mobile, have your most engaged customers eating out of your virtual hands.  The fifth email is less about education and more about one focused case delivered by their favorite jQuery Mobile expert on why buying the $30 a month plan, specifically, today, is the best possible thing they can do to improve their life today.<p>Execute correctly on this and you will <i>print money</i>.  How much money?  Just a comparable: for BCC, which is <i>far</i> less sophisticated on the email than this trick is and which has <i>terrible</i> unit economics, I make about twenty cents per email I send.  If I tell you how many orders of magnitude that number can be improved by, four different consulting clients are going to demand my spleen sauteed with a glass of chianti.<p>5)  Charge more!  Or at least give an option for charging more.  $30 a month is rat droppings to a business doing mobile development.  (You will not get that feedback from some HNers.  That's OK.  Five hundred HNers refusing to buy your product plus one business charged $500 a month = $6,000 of revenue a year.)  Put a $250 a month plan in there.  You <i>will</i> sell it, to someone who a) does not need to pay $250 of his own money to buy it and b) receives well in excess of that much value from your service.",1332323016
3733691,comment,3732844,3732844,4,0,exDM69,,,"I like the ideas behind the app inventor programming language. It has a lisp-ey look and feel to it. The language is made out of blocks that look like puzzle pieces. The shape of the piece stands for it's syntactic meaning, there's a distinct shape for expressions and statements. The color of the piece is it's type, e.g. red for boolean.<p>So an ""if"" statement is a statement piece that has places to plug in a boolean (red) expression piece and two statement pieces. That's structure and interpretation of programming languages for you.<p>The weakness of the language is the difficulty of representing recursion. I think there was another MIT project that did this well, their program representation was a visual graph where recursion was represented as back edges. This is similar to how the Haskell compiler stores programs internally as graphs. An interesting feature of the visual graph programming language was that all variable and function names are optional (but useful) comments.<p>I feel that researching and experimenting with non-text representations of computer programs is worth the effort.",1332323013

The use of dynamic memory allocation; the use of strlen to find out if the current buffer is empty - seriously? memset()'ing the entire buffer instead of bothering to zero out just the by after the end of the recv(). That's ignoring various bugs and other stuff.<p>I haven't looked at the rest of the code, but if it's anything like the buffering code this is nothing like what you'd expect to see in a decent C implementation.<p>It's fairy enough to demonstrate that the Go version makes it easy to write decent performing code, but the C version is atrocious (though to his credit it does at least buffer - I've seen so much C networking code that murders performance by doing small read()'s that I want to cry, including for the longest time the MySQL client library).<p>Of course part of his criticism is also down to not bothering to look for the plethora of C networking libraries that does this and does it well.",1332322416

He's terrific. So far so good.<p>In my life as director of commercials I have often been required to speak to groups of people. Whether it's a conference call or the ""pre pro"" meeting since I be ""the man"" I have to deliver the goods and coming from the formerly reticent Portland, Oregon I was not exactly hard wired to be a good speaker. I also occasionally have to speak at conferences which is an entirely different experience.<p>One of my tricks for a small group is to try to get everybody to sit as closely together as possible and I often try sit between ""the client"" and whoever is my big buddy at the agency. Usually it's the producer or the creative director or the writer. I'm trying to keep this as warm, cozy and informal as possible. We're all one big happy family. Usually it works. Production wise we always have our act together. Mood books. Animatics. Examples from other better, films. Really good casting and the performances to back them up. And by nature I use a lot of goofy asides (thankfully I'm a comedy director) and I keep it moving at a good clip. My thinking is that if I talk fast nobody will actually notice that I have completely taken over the concept and returned it to the great idea the 22 year intern had in the shower 18 months ago before it was reduce to meaningless drivel by the focus group/committee/in law review paradigm. We'll shoot both ways is swell way to get around a conflict. Mostly it works... they usually rub out any creativity in the editing process but at least we try. So small is beautiful. I'm your buddy. ""See you in Buenos Aires!"" Works. And to tell you the truth... it's not an act. It's me. I'm a natural cub scout activities director. Mostly I like people. And oddly over the years I have actually become a real chatter box... which is quite a feat for a Northwestern guy where old schoolers are prone maybe uttering a guttural groan every six months or so.<p>The bigger shows are different. I write them. I use marital... sorry visual aids and make it as tight as possible. I always like to have a dry side and a wet side. The dry side is the scripted part which I practice a lot and is hopefully as tight as a drum... ok with lots of incongruous hopefully funny asides... and the wet side is where I make some poor schlub from the audience come up and bite creamed corn or something.<p>I went to Conor's first meet up and was impressed but... it seemed to me that he was in many ways pretty much just working the room. He was selling. There was a predictable rhythm to it. Ice breaker. Intrigue, involve, challenge. Repeat. Good night. We discussed this over emails and for the next session he completely changed his focus... which was commendable and interesting and much more honest and compelling.<p>So my take away from this current focus on public speaking is that I really don't like the super pros. The folks that could hold an audience in rapt attention reading a phone book. It's an act and when you actually see through the smoke and mirrors... there is usually not much there. It's like the ""The Deer Hunter."" I left the theater in a daze... and then about 4 minutes later I decided I had no idea what the film was about.<p>I watch the TED talks all the time. Here's a favorite. <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_crea...</a> Sir Ken is funny. Informal. Self effacing and emotionally and intellectually compelling... absolutely spot on and I will follow him to hell.<p>The passionate, inspirational, self important, arm waving salesmen... forgetdaboutit.",1332321725

3733647,comment,3733408,3733608,2,0,talentdeficit,,,"Here's why HBO requires you to subscribe to their channel to watch Game of Thrones.<p>If you watch Game of Thrones, maybe you'll also watch Veep or Girls or Eastbound & Down or Life's Too Short. You might notice that HBO staggers their series so they overlap for roughly half their run. The Sopranos and The Wire never ran in lockstep, The Wire would start roughly halfway through The Sopranos run. They're trying to get you to continuously subscribe, rather than just subscribe for the 13 weeks Game of Thrones is on.<p>I know, you're too smart to fall for that, you're just gonna PVR Game of Thrones and stop recording exactly when the episode ends. You're never going to see anything except Game of Thrones no matter what HBO does. You, however, are still atypical. Maybe the day will come where HBO's trick doesn't work and their subscribers routinely cancel and resubscribe so it's most advantageous for them, but for now it works well enough that offering Game of Thrones a la carte is a money losing proposition for them. The sales they'll get from MG Siegler and yourself will not offset the subscribers they'll lose who would rather just pay for HBO continuously than go without Game of Thrones.<p>HBO (and other content producers) may be stubborn and short sighted, but they are not stupid. They've run the numbers. If you want to change their minds, you have to change the numbers and, regrettably, that means you have to boycott them completely. Pirating their content just signals it's valuable and HBO is right to keep availability costly (whether through direct pricing or obnoxious distribution terms).",1332321335

3733632,comment,3731441,3732078,0,0,tomp,,,"On some level, I agree with you, but on some, I don't... I'm actually really confused about what to think/what is right, I hope to clarify my mind by writing this down.<p>1) Why do words matter so much? I often use derogatory terms to refer to people, even my friends. I do it for fun (like black people calling each other ""niggas"" (at least in the movies, I assume also in real life))! I often do it to <i>apparently</i> offend someone, just to reverse it immediately after that by saying/doing something positive. Actually, I would be really offended if someone would put so much emphasis on my <i>words</i> as to completely disregard my <i>actions</i>! Sure, as you say, it can make some people <i>feel</i> unwelcome, but in reality, I sometimes <i>want</i> them to feel unwelcome, not because they are different, but simply because they prefer words over actions. I don't want to be around such people.<p>2) Sometimes, people just <i>are</i> different, and it's really strange to deny that. I live in Slovenia, and black people are really rare here (as are Hispanic; Asians are less rare, they come as tourists a lot). That means that when I see a black person, he <i>will</i> be different. I will almost certainly stare at him, maybe even comment that he's black. That doesn't mean, however, that I will treat him any differently when it comes to business. When I studied in England for a year, I didn't feel that black people were different. I actually had a black man as a roommate, and it was really great to see that his skin color didn't matter to him in any essential way, just as it didn't to me. (Attractive women are different too, I like watching them and doing things with them! But it has nothing to do with being her a woman, it has everything to do with her being attractive.)<p>3) If I understood you post correctly, pointing out that one of your fellow hackers also has an MBA would be something he would be ashamed of... The thing is, I think you cannot really make other people <i>feel bad</i>, you can only make them <i>feel worse</i>, when they already feel bad. An MBA person could also be proud of his MBA, and then nothing anyone would say could insult him; he wouldn't even interpret this as insults! I sometimes feel this about fat people... I have nothing against people being fat - be my guest, it's your body! However, only when <i>they are perfectly OK with it</i>! But I'm really annoyed when someone is fat and is whining about how they can't lose weight no matter how hard they try... Well, guess what, you didn't try hard enough (there are other priorities that are more important in your life). So, either try harder (get your priorities straight), or accept yourself (accept that losing weight is not your priority). Again, it doesn't matter if someone's fat or not, what matters is their lack of resolve.",1332320968

I believe you&#x27;re arguing that &quot;this time it&#x27;s different&quot; but I see no evidence for that.  In fact, there is a post almost every day on HN about Gmail users looking for an alternative.  I myself can&#x27;t wait to get off Gmail.  When I do that I&#x27;ll happily explicitly delete my Gmail account and all the email in it.  Because I am lazy and it&#x27;s easier to do that than it is to write a script to transfer it to what I use next.<p><i>You seem to come from the same time as I do ; I had my first modem around &#x27;85 and was very active on BBSes.</i><p>I got my first modem in 1985, got a phone line as my Christmas present from my parents in 1986 and started my own BBS.  Started a consulting company in 1993.  Started a small ISP in 1996, sold it in 1998 and started working for corporate America.<p>In the U.S., I find from a legal perspective that the less documentation you have the better.  That&#x27;s why every large U.S. company has an email retention policy that is very short.  Anyone looking to sue you needs proof and often that proof comes from your own records as part of discovery since they don&#x27;t have any proof.  If as part of a standard process you delete everything you&#x27;re not legally required to retain then you can&#x27;t be forced into helping their case.",1383742483

6682397,comment,6681626,6681626,7,0,pron,,,"I, too, have become addicted to HN.<p>Here are some things I like which some may not: I really like the &quot;general geek interest&quot; articles that usually make their way to the front page on weekends. I like political threads (that mostly concern directly or indirectly big government vs. free market). I like those threads not because they&#x27;re constructive in any way, but because they provide an insight into the psyche of Silicon Valley. As an amateur historian I think some of those articles and discussions are bona fide historical texts (like that video from Startup School of the guy who suggested Silicon Valley should secede from the US). I also post on these threads occasionally  not because I think I might convince anyone, but because I think many of the readers here are very young, or unfamiliar with non-American culture, and it would do them good to hear other opinions. I also like heated arguments over programming languages. I know they inevitably turn religious, but I don&#x27;t mind; they&#x27;re fun if you&#x27;re in the right mood, and I figure that anyone not in the mood for religious language wars won&#x27;t read the thread anyway.<p>This is something I don&#x27;t like, which some probably do: I wish HN were less biased towards web technologies and tools that are mostly applicable to fast-moving startups. Of course, this is the nature of the community and is to be expected. But I do wish there was more on embedded, enterprise, real time and game development. The problem with this bias is that I am sometimes swayed and mistakingly think that HN represents the &quot;software development community&quot;, which, of course, it doesn&#x27;t in the least. I need to remind myself that web companies are a small minority of software developers, and that IBM, Oracle and SAP employ more people than Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Netflix combined, ten times over. And that&#x27;s not even counting large organization IT departments and defense. So whenever I get a sense of &quot;so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s everyone is doing&quot; on HN, I need to remind myself that the community is far from representative (although it does tend to be composed of early adopters).",1383742110

Besides this if the NSA chooses, they can track practically ANYONE in the world, all they need is a mobile number. I would not be surprised if this is actually one of the tools they have.<p>How?<p>Due to the nature of how GSM and mobile operators integrate when roaming. When a mobile operator signs an international roaming agreement, they setup signalling links between their switches and VLR&#x27;s (Visitor Location Register).<p>The mobile operator in the visited country needs to authenticate you against your home network, this happens via SS7.<p>Once this link is established, it is assumed to be trusted, and most operators <i>DO NOT</i> apply any filtering on these commands. So with a carefully crafted SS7 command, you could request the location of a mobile subscriber, even if they have not even attempted to join your network.<p>Now here is where it gets interesting, get access to send ss7 commands from an operator with many international roaming agreements, and you can get details on practically any subscriber. Get access to 2-4 (i.e AT&T, T-Mobile, Vodaphone) of these massive tier1 operators, and you can get the location of practically everyone with a mobile handset.",1383740849

For example, you&#x27;re in situation A where you probably will need to use the infamous X argument, don&#x27;t use it, try to argue Y better.

But will be really hard in practice.<p>We have worked for years on the Opa technology, cf. <a href=""http://opalang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opalang.org</a>. Opa is a typechecked language with a JS syntax that compiles to JavaScript. Unlike JS though, the semantics of the language borrows to functional programming languages, to ensure the type system is sound and type checking feasible with almost full type inference.<p>Opa does more than type-checking to JS, but even if you just want to typecheck JS, basically you should look to design and implement a new programming language, with a syntax as close as possible to JS but with proper semantics and then that compiles to JS after type-checking. You could add a set of tools to help port actual JS code to this new language.",1383740608

However, after WW2 companies moved to employer-paid accident insurance instead of paying out-of-pocket workman&#x27;s comp, and as a result, the cost savings would be socialized anyway.  This tilted the equation back toward an 8-hour day, at least from management&#x27;s perspective, though employees remained staunchly opposed to the longer day for a generation.<p>What ultimately killed it was a status thing: by the 70s and 80s, employees on the 30-hour work week felt like they were &quot;slackers&quot;, and didn&#x27;t have the same social status as those who worked harder.",1383740420

6682245,comment,6680763,6682061,7,0,Theodores,,,"A few of my school friends worked for GCHQ and I questioned their reasons for doing so around ten years or so ago (a lot has changed in the world since then, but a lot hasn&#x27;t). Back then there were three reasons beyond &#x27;I need an income&#x27;:<p>1) terrorists - someone has got to stop them blowing up innocent babies and children<p>2) kiddie porn - someone has got to take the war on paedophiles seriously<p>3) organised crime - who knows? Selling arms to the terrorists? Laundering money. That&#x27;s it. Laundering money and drugs. I remember now.<p>These &#x27;reasons&#x27; can be trotted out like a mantra and working for <i>them</i> is a bit like being a soldier fighting a noble cause that everyone else has to respect.<p>As per other comment on &#x27;The Cube&#x27;, people at GCHQ are kept in little boxes and not made aware of what the big plan is. It is a system that works really well. So, even if someone&#x27;s job has nothing to do with the war on kiddie porn, the war on drugs or The War Against Terror, they know that without their organisation&#x27;s effort then we would be flooded with the evil stuff and democracy would be doomed.<p>The &#x27;I cannot talk about my work&#x27; thing works really well. Although I am not convinced by it. I think that it is all too convenient to hide behind that rather than be honest about how dull/wrong a given job is.<p>I think you also place too much thought into the idea that NSA/GCHQ build these systems. Actually it is the guys at the contractors - Lockheed Martin - that build these things, the NSA/GCHQ guys are no more involved in things than the checkout staff at a supermarket are involved in all the evil things Walmart/Monsanto/whoever do. That is the saddest part of it. We uphold NSA/GCHQ to be omnipotent and omniscient, but they are not. The main contractor - Lockheed Martin - are upstream of what the NSA/GCHQ does and they are experts at getting government contracts. Since they can listen in to what all of the other contractors bid they can bid competitively if they really want the work. Since they also own most of the politicians and can promise so many jobs in so many states, they can own the entire government. NSA are not the enemy, Lockheed Martin and their rivals are. And, to answer your question, the dark side programmers work for them.",1383739359

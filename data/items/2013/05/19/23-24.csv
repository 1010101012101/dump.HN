Read one on low fat. Now this one.<p>The assumption here, as it was in the others, is that we now know what works and what doesn't. And that forces beyond our control conspire to keep us fat. In this version, the thesis is that some form of certification system for marketing to children can cure the obesity epidemic.<p>Beats me. But I'll bet twenty bucks that a decade or two from now we'll be reading the same type of article, only with different kinds of suggested cures.<p>I'm of the opinion that there is nothing wrong, or rather that the population is acting entirely naturally and appropriately given their adaptation to specific evolutionary conditions, which have changed drastically in the last 100 years. I doubt controlling marketing material will have a long-lasting effect, but anything is worth a shot. It is a very serious problem.<p>Looking at the recent past, I'd be just a bit more humble about it.",1369007991

From Wikipedia:<p>Fast Company's investigation brought up circumstantial evidence that indicated a link between an encryption patent application filed by Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry on 15 August 2008, and the bitcoin.org domain name which was registered 72 hours later. The patent application (#20100042841) contained networking and encryption technologies similar to Bitcoin's. After textual analysis, the phrase ""...computationally impractical to reverse"" was found in both the patent application and bitcoin's whitepaper.

This could be done by addressing the embarrassment side of having to call pest control in, especially with the target customer of first time parents with young children. Are there preventative services you could offer, which is where you get into selling a 'peace of mind' service. Alternatively maybe you opt to have no branded vehicles - is being discreet of value to your customers?<p>b) Generating unprecedented sales numbers - This could be done by targeting residences around a home you're currently working at, or partnering with food service chains or offering a service to home buyers to do a full report. Even targeting pet owners (I'm sure there are some pests that are harmful to domesticated animals) If you educate a new market then it's a whole lot easier than fighting over one that knows your competitors well.<p>c) Automate the business side for efficiency - set up systems that remind you to follow up with dormant enquiries, schedule  visits on a linear route for operatives, auto-contact your previous customers to remind them of an annual check. This would be changing the industry from the inside out.<p>d) Could you productise the industry - same as weedkiller & tools are a huge seller for the lawncare industry.<p>Brainstorm on your customers pain points - what stops them picking up the phone - high cost, too busy, inconvenient process and so on. The best way to disrupt the industry is by doing something that isn't just a 'better offer' as that can be copied - it has to be fundamental to your way of operating.<p>Good luck with your improvements!",1369007890

I like it a lot: it's fast in both UI and fetching feeds, mobile web, and the developer is responsive. I don't like the 3-column interface, however, since I don't really read by category or folders. With the mobile web  version the 3-column UI makes it slow to skim through all the feeds. If you like There was also some problems with scrolling using the arrows keys (I think it would move to a new post instead). Not open-source/self-hostable is another negative. (It does use Github, but only for issue tracking.)<p>• InoReader At first I thought this was a Feedly-esque browser extension because all the links I found were to the Chrome store. I finally tried it, and it is a fast Google Reader clone, kind of like CommaFeed. It's visually a little busy, but the UI is fast with less sedimentation[1] than most.

I run a small service that looks like it would be a perfect use-case for a database.  Even though all the data is beautifully normalized and instantly searchable, using a database <i>directly</i> would be impossible.  Instead it starts as a series of flat text files.  From these flat text files, the database is automatically generated.  Three big gains here:<p>Version control on the text files works perfectly as expected.<p>Creating ad-hoc and one-off columns (while figuring out how to best normalize unfamiliar data) is trivial and painless.<p>Comments!  It is so easy to write in-line notes.  This alone is the killer feature of text files.  Normalizing and curating data requires making a lot of choices and comments let me keep track of these.<p>Of course there are downsides.  You must edit the text file to add data.

So most people who are 'severely allergic' to gluten are really just convinced that is the case.<p>The last time I saw my cousin she looked and acted anorexic, meanwhile raving about her new gluten free vegan lifestyle. She looked terrible. My other cousin who suffers from narcolepsy was on the same diet raving about all her new energy while falling asleep at the table. Meanwhile I went from being the fattest person in the family to the most in shape in less than 10 months. I usually jokingly order a side of gluten these days, just to piss the gluten freers off.<p>Tip for American grocery shoppers: Don't hit the isles. Stay within the vegetable and fruits section, shop there, only there, then leave. That is a healthy diet. Usually there are nuts and meat in that section. Don't be looking for the gluten free potato chips and cookies, that isn't healthy.",1369007217

It's kinda odd, because the internet is supposed to be an open thing.

Every line of code is written to support the target workload to the exclusion of others because of the tradeoffs required. Design decisions are extremely sticky over the long-term because they are tacitly embedded in every piece of code.<p>The point you are missing is that (1) significantly altering the basic architectural characteristics is tantamount to a complete rewrite from scratch and (2) existing users design their applications around the design assumptions of the platform so fundamentally changing the architecture abandons the user base as well.<p>This is why in practice almost everyone starts from a blank slate if they need new architectural capabilities. And in the few cases where they did manage to re-architect an existing system, not only did it cost more than doing it from scratch but they lost their user base anyway.<p>I've designed these types of systems for a long time. When a database engine is first designed, its capabilities, limitations, and future performance ceiling are essentially set in stone. All potential modifications have to fit within those constraints so you need to be cognizant of the choices you are making but not really thinking about. An experienced database engine designer can look at a system design and tell you what types of data models and workloads the system will always do poorly on. And every database engine design has weaknesses designed into them. Hadoop just happens to be a particularly weak engine with a low ceiling in terms of its expressiveness.",1369006199

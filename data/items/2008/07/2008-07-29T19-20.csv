Not the absolute amount. If taxes pay for trains, upkeep, insurance, salaries for drivers, <i>as well as the infrastructure</i>, then that is a greater tax burden than just the highways, PER USAGE. I considered explaining that in my post, but I figured that math savvy hackers wouldn't need it. I figured wrong.<p><i>And your ""gas tax should fund highways"" idea is laughable.</i><p>Oh? Please...explain why.<p><i>The gas tax doesn't even cover maintenance of existing road systems,</i><p>Oh, I see. Well, if you re-read my sentence I said ""SHOULD"" fund highways.

Unless you are as smart as Johann Karl Friedrich Gauss, savvy as a half-blind Calcutta bootblack, tough as General William Tecumseh Sherman, rich as the Queen of England, emotionally resilient as a Red Sox fan, and as generally able to take care of yourself as the average nuclear missile submarine commander, you should never have been allowed near this document. Please dispose of it as you would any piece of high-level radioactive waste and then arrange with a qualified surgeon to amputate your arms at the elbows and gouge your eyes from their sockets. This warning is necessary because once, a hundred years ago, a little old lady in Kentucky put a hundred dollars into a dry goods company which went belly-up and only returned her ninety-nine dollars. Ever since then the government has been on our asses.

It's the most beautiful collection of group-think in programming I've seen in a long time.<p>I've been doing web apps programming for a few years now, and I do admit there are better technologies out there. That's why I've been dipping my feet in lisp for the past year, and lately spending my nights with Clojure. But what he's advocating isn't good programming, it's sheep mentality, and I'm disapointed to see it here.<p>But since it's not nice to just be a critic:<p><pre><code>    * You’re not building atop an open-source framework
    * You’re writing your own framework upon which to build</code></pre>
I have open source above, open source below and open source in the database. But holding it all together is a thin layer written by me, simply because I want to be able to adjust it as much and as often as I feel like.<p><pre><code>    * You’re not using an ORM layer
    * You’re writing your own ORM layer</code></pre>
I actually played with writing my own a few year back. In the meantime I thought a lot of times about its benefits and I ultimately decided against using one. Why? Because I only ever use one database engine, and if I change it it will definitely happen on a new app. Also I value too much development speed and flexibility. I saw code developed with ORM, and I still have see xml in my nightmares. Granted, it will probably work in many contexts, and if/when I switch to lisp I will probably use a persistance engine instead of a database, but now and for me it's definitely not an advantage.<p><pre><code>    * You believe you can write it faster or better or more efficiently than any available library</code></pre>
You can, always. It's only a matter of effort invested. In most cases, the years necessary are not worth it, but very ocasionaly it pays.<p><pre><code>    * You have more than one developer on your project and no written coding style guidelines</code></pre>
I usually poke them on the head when they forget spaces. I most certainly don't waste time with written specs.<p><pre><code>    * Your bug tracker serves as your functional scope or your development roadmap</code></pre>
Actually it does. Took it from google: the best project management tool is a queue. Put stuff at one end, solve at the other. And also, we don't believe in deadlines.<p><pre><code>    * You aren’t using source control</code></pre>
We are and like it.<p><pre><code>    * You comment the what but not the why</code></pre>
We never comment. Ever. We spend lunch breakes thinking up intelligent variable names.<p><pre><code>    * You tend to pass properties instead of instances to functions</code></pre>
No idea what this is, but we probably do it.<p><pre><code>    * Your “deployment procedure” involves any combination of FTP and/or drag n’ drop</code></pre>
More like scripting and ssh. This one's ok.<p><pre><code>    * You write code in a manner that cannot be unit tested</code></pre>
We don't unit test. True, it hurts ocasionaly, but at the amount of new (good) code we write, it's not really necessary. What we do (well, I at least and I'm evangelical about it) is read and re-read code, preferably before compiling.<p><pre><code>    * Your primary method of code reuse is copy/paste</code></pre>
No comment.<p><pre><code>    * You don’t read any development blogs focused on your primary and secondary languages or technologies</code></pre>
LOL<p><pre><code>    * You haven’t been to a conference or birds-of-a-feather meeting in the past year</code></pre>
Really lol'ed this time.<p><pre><code>    * The only code you read at work is your own</code></pre>

Don't. True.",1217360032

For instance, if you're writing a novel and you need to keep track of your characters and their relationships, being able to link from one note to another is incredibly handy.<p>So I see that as where Luminotes fits in. It's really a notebook of interlinked notes, which you can't really do with Google Docs or Tadalist. You can do it with a full-fledged wiki like Mediawiki, but for many people that's overkill, and besides doesn't come with the nice UI.<p>As for bullet point check-off capability, you can quite easily use the strikethrough for that purpose. I know several people who use that for crossing things off lists as they're completed. It's perhaps not as convenient as a single checkbox, but it does work.<p>""Personal wiki"" isn't marketing speak, as I'm going for the ""interlinked collection of notes/pages"" aspect of the word ""wiki"" rather than the collaboration sense of the word.

On the other hand, 10 years ago when we all felt like this last time the total market size for any company was at maximum 100 million potential users. Now we’re in the billions of users. Facebook connections alone bring 500 million, Twitter 200 million. 10 years ago we only connected for brief periods of time when we were at our PCs. Now we’re connected to apps all the time, everywhere we go. So maybe there’s a bubble. It’s hard to say. But we’re also looking at unprecedented opportunity.”",1300895830

There is no central place in the company for employees to share interesting information about business topics, ask questions and get meaningful answers. Currently all of this happens via email.<p>Don't you think that something like a private HN for the Enterprise could solve this problem (actually I'm thinking of a little bit Quora/HN solution)?
Private and secure place where all the company employees go to ask questions, share links and have meaningful discussions about business topics they care about?<p>The key elements of the system:<p>1. topics (essentially tags that you can follow)<p>2. karma points (reward for being active and a way to find out what is more interesting - like on HN)<p>3. Ability to add links, files (doc templates?images?) and text (questions)<p>4. search<p>5. Quora like activity stream sorted by karma consisting of links, questions and other interesting info from topics you follow<p>Anyone here WANTS this kind of system in their company?

There are a few honest lawyers who actually take pride in their work (but who probably still charge more than their time is really worth), but there are many, many lawyers who are simply well-dressed scam artists.<p>New company documents should cost $0. Each VC firm should purchase the rights to the document templates up-front (or hire a general counsel full-time and draft their own!) and use them again and again.<p>Would this put a lot of lawyers out of work? Yes. Do they have loans to pay? Probably. Is that your problem as an entrepreneur or a VC? No.<p>Maybe this kind of system would encourage Americans to actually build things, instead of going to law school.<p>I actually feel so strongly about this that I'd be willing to contribute my knowledge (mostly in the trademark realm) to a group of pro bono non-lawyer entrepreneurs who have dealt with all of this stuff before.

2359898,comment,2359358,2359358,0,0,geebee,,,"I found this ""room for debate"" to be a disappointment.  The nytimes wrote an earlier article titled ""how we value the super rich"" that I thought was far more insightful.  This article indicated that Americans distinguish between super-rich who create wealth, and super-rich who are essentially toll collectors.  It appears that conventional wisdom does an ok job at this - tech entrepreneurs, for instance, are generally admired, whereas wall street is generally despised, especially these days.  There is some merit to this: <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/11/29/101129fa_fact_cassidy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/11/29/101129fa_fact_...</a><p>Unfortunately, there is nuance, and I don't think there is really any possibility that the public will fully grasp it.  Not because they're dumb, but because it takes a huge amount of time to figure it out.  Even that new yorker article, which takes a severely dim view of wall street, absolutely acknowledges that banking fulfills a critical role in the creation of wealth.  How do you make sure you keep the baby when you throw out the bath water? And we're all too familiar with ""innovative technology development"" companies that really just exist to patent stuff, in order to extract a toll from those who do create (often completely independently of the original ""innovation"").<p>As for what to do?  I don't even have a good answer in theory.  I browse the randian/libertarian literature at top dog in berkeley every now and then, and there is a compelling case that many rent-collecting segments of the economy are propped up by government regulation, though even then, what do you do, eliminate the patent system?  go back on the gold standard?  abolish the AMA?  Some people would say yes, I'm not so sure.  I wonder if just a more vigilant attempt on the part of government to identify and eliminate rent-collection would help... I know, I know, a lot of people would hear this and say ""in your dreams"", and as usual, I'm really unsure about this myself.",1300895487

Nothing other than the subjective valuations of individuals.  The same is true of fiat currencies, except here individual subjective valuations concern matters such as 'not getting arrested' or 'not getting shot.'<p>Bitcoin is a technologic, cryptographically-rooted, informational commodity.  It has unique, desirable properties inherent to its design and structure.  Individuals subjectively value these properties.   Their reasons and value scales differ, but the simple fact that people are already trading Bitcoins proves that it is subjectively valued.<p>You talk about 'confidence crises.'  This is unique historically only to fiat currencies (and paper currencies built fractionally on commodities like gold).  The subjective valuation of fiat currencies is derived from political considerations.  As such, confidence in them is built on the ever-shifting sands of political perceptions.<p>When was the last confidence crisis in gold?  There hasn't been one. People value gold for its physical properties defined by the laws of nature.  Those properties do not change and individuals have continued to subjectively value them.<p>The same is true of Bitcoin.  Its properties are rooted in our present understanding of cryptographic principles.  As long as individuals continue to value properties such as anonymity, decentralization, finite supply, low transaction fees, ease of digital manipulation, ability to integrate smart contracts, etc... we have no reason to expect a 'confidence crisis.'<p>This will be true as long as the cryptographic logic buttressing the system remains sound – just like the laws of physics underlie the desired properties of gold.  Breaking this cryptographic logic (akin to cheap transmutation of lead into gold) would require breakthrough advancements of our knowledge of cryptography and discoveries on hitherto unsolved mathematical problems.  But even in this case, the open-source nature of Bitcoin allows it to evolve new cryptographic implementations that would avoid such problems.",1300894847

Door locks are a pretty standard solution. We all have them on our homes, and we think to ourselves, ""I've done a <i>reasonable</i> job of securing my home."" When someone's home/office is broken in to, we can easily identify with them. We look at the scenario and realize that we could easily suffer the same.

When someone's infrastructure is compromised, everyone stands atop the high hill, looking down on the drowning masses as the tide comes in, but the reality is that we're all vulnerable at some point.<p>A startup could easily spend as much on security as they do developing their core product. Why? As a startup, I'm not going to invest in double-reinforced steel doors, bullet proof glass windows, armed guards, and a centralized vault. That's wasted money in my view, because I have a reasonable expectation that people will act with civility. If someone does break in, I'm insured, and I will report the crime to authorities who will investigate. If the criminal is caught, there are real penalties, and they'll carry the stigma of having to check ""YES"" next to the ""Have you ever been convicted of a felony"" on their job applications.<p>I'm not saying we should try these kids as adults, but when I was 14, some kids who shared a bus stop with me broke in to a house near our bus stop and trashed the place. They got caught and suffered some severe penalties. It was a valuable lesson for everyone involved. A couple of the kids were from really bad homes and suffered from greater influences than the threat of the law, but the other two turned their act around really quickly. Had they gotten away with it, or had the attitude been ""they're just kids"", I'm not sure they would have realized the impact of the crimes they committed.

The problem is that it ignores all the environmental factors that make poor life choices particularly punishing for the poor.<p>Certainly, there are some individuals that can overcome hardships while coming from any background - but these are rare. The more typical case is someone who will make some good choices and some bad choices. If that individual comes from a well-off background, the poor choices (e.g. kids early) can be papered over while the good choices can be better leveraged through access to more opportunities.<p>For someone from a less well-off background each mistake can be very costly. Have kids too early and you are unlikely to be able to support the kids while working and paying for college. Opportunities are harder to seize as well - living paycheque to paycheque would make it hard to pick up and move to SF to found a startup for example.<p>I'm not saying it's impossible to escape poverty without help - as I said, a dedicated individual can most certainly do it. From a statistical point of view, however, poverty will beget more poverty because the average poor person will not have enough second chances to make it out. If we want society to improve, we MUST provide a way for the average poor person to get past some of their mistakes. Yes, it looks like undeserved handouts, but I think it's the right thing to do.<p>P.S. Don't get me started on education. This is the single best thing we can do to help kids escape their background and we continuously underfund and mismanage it. It's fucking criminal.",1300894138

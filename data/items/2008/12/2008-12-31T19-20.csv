There is a mechanism for measuring mileage built right into the vehicle, the odometer. Its already there on all vehicles and I would assume less people would try to defeat it. I don't know if Oregon has an annual inspection but it could easily be read then and reported.<p>It seems like the cost of outfitting all cars with GPS devices would be costly... plus it would never work anyway.",1230753460

One is inflation, and the other is growth.  Growth can mean that everyone is rich by the standards of previous times in terms of how much of everything they can afford, which could be reflected in the prices for everything dropping.  Universal prosperity in computing hardware, for example, has resulted in exactly the opposite of the price inflation you seem to expect.",1230751713

It's a perfect child of perl, has roots in shell scripting, and makes ""normal"" tasks trivial.

If I want parallelism, haskell makes a lot of sense, due to the riggerous math and magic it has to verify everything.<p>For his closure based language, he invented javascript.

Early people didn't do so badly with LinkedIn, Zynga, or even Groupon either. There were a grand total of four (4) people affected by the Zynga equity contract renegotiation you reference.<p><pre><code>  startups should be paying\n</code></pre>\nObviously startups don't have money, they have equity and a dream. This is the point of a startup. If all one cares about is median-case money rather than impact or max-case money, startups are indeed irrational and one should work at Oracle or something.<p>That said, it is the presence of startups recruiting great engineers that don't care as much about money that is causing bigcos like Google to offer higher salaries. It is the only way they can compensate for the bureaucracy.<p><pre><code>  An average (median) engineer should be making $200,000\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately, this is similar to saying that teachers, cops, firefighters, housemakers should be extremely well paid. Everyone thinks their own talent is surpassingly rare and their job is crucial to society. But the truth is that engineering salaries have been driven up by a startup bubble in much the same way finance salaries have been driven up. When the bubble pops and many of the startups without much revenue fail, salaries are likely to fall back down to earth.<p>Additionally, savvy employers will find other ways to get more people into programming. As people who would have trained to become chemical, electrical, or mechanical engineers start retraining to learn programming (e.g. via sites like Codeacademy), in response to market signals, salaries will invariably go down.",1328607465

I think it's pretty clear that CoffeeScript is an ""improve on javascript"" language quite explicitly.<p>Interestingly, I think that quality is entirely orthogonal to production worthiness and any implied or explicitly stated guarantees about utility and unbreakiness.<p>I've personally thrown my weight behind up and coming technologies in the past (Merb to be specific, back in the Merb vs Rails insurgency), and ended up supporting a technology stack that was left abandoned.  In spite of that, my company continued running happily on Merb for 3 years after that (until a move to Scala).<p>That jashkenas warns people with a ""caveat emptor"" doesn't mean a tool shouldn't be used in production.  It means that you should carefully evaluate how you use your tools in production, make sure you write modular testable code, be willing to dive down into the weeds, and most importantly always have a backup plan.<p>The interesting part about CoffeeScript is that the backup plan (again if you have properly factored code) can just be ""use more Javascript"". :P<p>(my own caveat is that I do not CoffeeScript in production.  At least, not yet.)",1328606060

Poverty itself is already very dangerous. But poverty without having the ability to prove your own existance is so much more dangerous. Having an own passport or ID card is a big step for many people who had never any official papers about their being.<p>As the Wikipedia article details, the system may not work fully acurate, but it is so much simpler to implement and more reliable than anything else I could think of. Giving out ID cards only? They get lost or destroyed, fakes get made, poors get talked into handing their ID card to that nice guy who will go for them to this-or-that office (especially for elections, etc). A biometric signal is so much more difficult to lose or falsify or get talking into giving it up.<p>And the psycological effect of ""officially being a unique person"" is quite large (take a look a Muhammad Yunus' book on how he invented the microcredit system and estabished the Grameen bank in Bangladesh).",1328606016

This is much harder than blocking an online revocation check, where the attacker only has to block the checks during the attack.<p>OK sure. Except what's the actual correlation between time-of-detection and time-of-attack in the real world? If certificates aren't getting added to CRLs until they are actually being used in attacks then at the moment, (which previous responses from Google to CA hacks have suggested is in fact the case) then this optimization has bought you what? One-time use of the cert? (When attacking Chrome users.) What's new there?<p>I'm not going to deny the possibility that most CA's revocation infrastructure is so incredibly awful that this all ends up actually being a good thing for security.

It has more to do with the fact that they have so much money that they can afford to do things in very stupid ways. Retail is e.g. most likely far more sophisticated in their usage of IT than the big investment banks. Banks are full of custom systems that are 10 times less efficient at solving problems that have become commodities everywhere else.

I think here they pay more to come to my school than they would at almost any private university.<p>On the other hand, the way the system is set up, it is actually cheaper to go to a state school if your family is <i>richer</i>--financial aid depends on how much you can afford, while in-state tuition is just cheaper for everybody. One of the reasons I ended up going to Berkeley over CMU is that my dad had just cashed out some stock options so I was offered no financial aid at either place. (Maybe we filled the forms out incorrectly, of course, and I would probably have still gone to Berkeley for other reasons, but it's an interesting reversal of expectations--Berkeley was cheaper because, on paper, my family made <i>more</i>...)<p>So the real irony is that going to a nice state school is actually a better deal if you're in the upper-middle class in the Bay Area.

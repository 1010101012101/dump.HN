By the time programmers gain enough experience to see that it's all the same, they might be starting to look at starting their true legacy, a family (not code that lives on)",1202445960

Well thought out, flawlessly executed in an area that will no doubt have the potential to make bucket loads of cash.<p>But there are a few problems I can think of. The first is the market for adverts is dominated by a giant. But where there is competition there is potential for success. The other problem is images + javascript can be blocked through code [0] and by humans. [1]  Those clever lads at google get around this using text. Text fools code blocking and to some extent humans. So the technique you use will be less effective than googles technology.   What other technology is behind the advert engine. How for instance does it target individuals?<p><pre><code>   Q What do we really need?

Maybe it's a little bit idealistic but for me I just want to make things that users want [3] and try to make their day a little easier and helping them instead of bombarding them. Reducing the amount of useless information and noise.  Linda Stone poses the question(s), <i>""what do we really need, and what do we need to pay attention to""</i>.

This is a child with blue eyes which is more distantly related to Brad Pitt than either of its more closely related brown eyed parents.<p>You can use the converse to spot illegitimate children, as my old biology teacher done on dull parent evenings.

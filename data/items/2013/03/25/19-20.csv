This was wrong, and was done in the name of an ideology that uses rhetorical tricks such as your 'microaggressions' to justify such disproportionate behavior.",1364241471

Anyway I'm thinking a thousand cans times three times a day means 3000 drivebys times 5 minutes each means 15000 minutes expended per day with the old system driving to visit each can.  Now realize that you're not going to save any drive time using the solar cans.  But for the sake of amusement we'll try it.  Now 15 kilominutes given an 8 hour working day results in thirty or so trash trucks and garbage men under the old (and new...) system.<p>Not sure if that's reasonable or not.  A couple workmans comp cases and the next million empties are going to cost an extra buck, sure.  On the other hand, its hard to imagine burning a dollar of diesel between each can.  Philly just isn't that big.  Then again, if each garbage man was paid $30K per year aka $15/hr and emptied about ten cans per hour, thats $1.50 per empty so factor in lower pay..  But how do you actually save money if you have to drive the same old route anyway?<p>Interestingly the economics of big city garbage pickup begin to make it look reasonable to simply have the post office mail trash to the landfill.  Its not many orders of magnitude apart, and fundamentally junkmail delivery isn't all that far away from garbage pickup.  So it should cost about a ""postage"" amount.",1364241403

It also doesn't measure for the complexity of the conceptual piece. It hasn't been established that the same level of 'conceptual pieces' are tackled across all programming languages per commit.<p>Just some thoughts. That said, I think though given all the factors involved (more expressive concepts per commit are perhaps tackled in more expressive languages, and that cancels out that less expressive concepts are tackled per commit in less expressive languages -- that balances out simplicity in simpler / less expressive languages can lead to more actual features commited), that actually the methodology kind of works.

Accounts remain active.<p>Fortunately, AdWords is one of the few Google properties where you can actually get a human on the phone and have them intervene with the automated results (though it can certainly take a lot of back and forth, in my personal experience).<p>In a more general sense, this is something that you constantly run in to if you have your automated systems performing any action that a user could view as punitive.

Then I get a list of all files in a current project and possible tags I could look for (e.g., it will show many are also tagged with ""java"" or with ""C++"" so I can add those tags to my search).<p>The problem is historically (that is, until recently) these kind of queries have been prohibitively expensive in both space and time: there's time complexity of doing a boolean query on the index, there's the space complexity of storing the index amenable to those queries both on memory and in-disk. This is difficult to in the context of legacy desktop machines (think minimal requirements to run Windows XP: 256mb of RAM, 5400 rpm disk, pentium III cpu) that were prevalent until just a few years ago.<p>Instead, the solution chosen is the same solution that folks building distributed ""NoSQL"" databases or sharded SQL database setup go for: group all related data into a few rows (in this case directories) and treat the data as hierarchical (a return to pre-RDBMS era).<p>Today if your working set fits in main memory (which is most probably the case for even the biggest data collections on most people's personal desktops), there's no longer a performance related reason to use a single-node (non-partitioned) ""NoSQL""-style setup (there may be other reasons to, e.g., wanting to have a more flexible schema, saving time, wanting to scale out later, etc...)<p>I suspect the real reason we haven't done this with file systems is due to legacy: I have data organized into files and folders going back to ~1998 that I do not want to lose and can't afford to tag manually.<p>The support from my theory comes from the fact that the first systems to embrace non-hierarchical file system have been legacy-free devices where important storage (for 99% of the people out there...) is either on the SIM card (addresses), in the cloud (mail) or is de-facto tagged and has to be copied over in any case (photos which have EXIF tags and are stored in photo album apps or cloud services).<p>The same has also been happening on the other end of the spectrum: e.g., large scale distributed storage system for much similar reasons (i.e., they are the first of their kind, so there was a ""license"" to build these systems in a legacy-free fashion).<p>tl;dr Hierarchical storage is a non-functional requirement.

Might be cultural, or might be related to it being easier to modularize your own contributions when the language has defined module boundaries to help you out. So languages that favor more small packages may (though I have no evidence!) see smaller average commit size than those which favor fewer, more monolithic packages (or source files).<p>It's an interesting metric in any case, I'd just prefer not editorializing it.

A ranking of languages by average commit size would be truth-in-advertising, and then it could be followed by a speculative blurb about what that means, with language expressiveness being one hypothesis. I think that'd still be perfectly interesting as something to do and discuss, but maybe it'd have a harder time getting traction.<p>Comes up in published scientific literature fairly often as well, unfortunately. E.g. it's common for neuroscience papers to be solid scientific investigations of a specific variable, but to then completely oversell the results by labeling it as a proxy measure for something more evocative, like ""creativity"" or ""free will"" or ""empathy"", with a <i>really</i> handwavy argument for why this specific variable is a suitable proxy for that full concept. It's also getting common in the past 1-2 years for people to claim trends in Google Ngram type data are proxies for historical popularity of concepts, when there are a lot of confounding reasons that might not be true.",1364240049

Do not sign anything they extend to you to ""make it go away."" Send all communications from them to your LAWYER first, never respond on your own.<p>2) LAWYER<p>Now, it seems that the party suing you is not in it for your money as they know you can't pay; besides, the lawsuit itself costs money, possibly more money than any judge or jury would reasonably award. Instead they're probably looking to:<p>I) Hurt you<p>II) Sue your current, previous, future, etc... employers who might actually have money.<p>III) Both<p>If you sign something admitting guilt (even if you don't realize it), there is a chance (depending on what they've accused you of, <i>probably</i> not the case for breach of contract but <i>I am not a lawyer</i>) they <i>might</i> use it to start a criminal trial against you (which meets goal I). It is highly unlikely that this trial will happen or that you'll serve any jail time if it does, but it will be absolutely painful.<p>You've now also opened up the potential for your current employer to be sued (meeting goal II). In turn, your current employer, has the right to sue you (again, helping meet I) and in this case probably for good reason: either you're honest in having caused damage or you've given false testimony.<p>What the party suing you is counting on is for you to NOT get a LAWYER and to prevail against you in a system that is adversarial. I'm a big fan of the adversarial legal system: it works great for criminal cases where you're guaranteed many rights, most important presumption of evidence, and a defender. However the way it's currently practiced in civil cases is flawed: the goal is for attorney on the either side to win, rather than for both parties to work diligent towards uncovering the truth, but most people don't realize it.<p>On the other hand, if you do get a LAWYER and are found innocent, the other party will cover your legal fees. If you and your LAWYER settle without going to trial, the legal fees will also be much lower (and you will not have to pay damages).<p>If you lose, the lawyer can make the loss hurt less: e.g., lessen the damages, avoid a situation that opens you to a criminal trial, etc...<p>So: LAWYER.<p>Disclaimer: have never been sued personally, know entrepreneurs who have. Not a lawyer but curious about law. Everyone should also read every comment by grellas and rayiner.

You have to keep in mind that it is not unreasonable to see the penis jokes as a sexist microaggression [1], esp. if you are a woman of color working in a field where those kinds of jokes and microaggerssions happen a lot. To that end, sexism is reenforced and made more prevalent by those microaggressions. Sexism and misogyny in society does directly translate to outright physical violence and murder of women. So for a woman of color to confront that microaggression and then receive threats on her physical safety and life isn't just some idle trolling, it reflects a reality that this person may very well experience. Keep in mind that 1 in 5 women in the US will be sexually assaulted in their life time and that people of color, esp. black women, face a variety of forms of institutionally backed violence. Public naming and shaming is a valid form of defense against those conditions and kinds of violence.<p>> The whole thing was and is a ridiculous mess, and it all was avoidable by behaving like responsible adults.<p>I agree and it should be noted that being a responsible adult means avoiding penis jokes when representing your company at a conference they sponsored, esp. when said conference is working very hard on including women.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression</a>",1364238865

I just happen to know that, according to the tree specialist, a 5-8m tall magnolia tree can probably survive in a cube of soil 1.5m x 1.5m x 1.5m encased in a concrete pit lined with a geotextile to prevent root damage to the structure. It needs to be hooked up to a fairly sophisticated hydroponic system to keep it alive and their growth will be stunted by the restrictions placed on the root ball. Another issue with some of the trees shown is that, because they are under the structure, they will need to be turned every couple of years and/or illuminated with special lights to keep them from being distorted by growing towards the sun and to ensure they receive enough light to photosynthesise.<p>More generally, the computer renderings you see in the article are often generated by students or outside design agencies based on sketches and other early information from the architects. They are done in a few weeks often to very tight deadlines and are definitely not based on technical drawings so you can get all kinds of weird stuff in there depending on how imaginative the computer graphics person is and how late they had to stay up to beat the deadline. A real skyscraper takes years to design, the details of how tree pits work wont be fully bottomed out until a few years after the fancy renderings are done.

9854504,comment,9851293,9853989,0,0,exelius,,,"Several reasons:<p>1. Apple and Google are (and were at the time of the Nokia acquisition) larger companies than Microsoft. Microsoft&#x27;s usual tactics are to throw their weight around, which they can&#x27;t do when they&#x27;re the smallest dog in the fight. What&#x27;s worse, mobile represents a huge amount of revenue for both companies, so they have both the incentive and the ability to outspend Microsoft. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t have a lower cost base (if anything, it&#x27;s the opposite) so they have no basis for a sustainable advantage. Mobile was never a huge revenue number for Microsoft, so they always have the option of walking away.<p>2. Apple and Google also have the vast majority of the market covered from a value proposition standpoint. Apple goes after the high-margin top end, and Google uses an arms-dealer model to go after the middle and low end. What value proposition does Microsoft have that is substantially different? If you can&#x27;t differentiate your product, and you have the disadvantage of being smaller in a market with strong network effects, you have no basis for a sustainable advantage.<p>3. The market had already started to mature by the time Microsoft bought Nokia. While you can get in early in a growth market and out-grow the competition, it&#x27;s an uphill battle if you&#x27;re as late as Microsoft was. Your competition will still outpace your gains even if you outspend them by a significant margin.<p>4. Building a niche product (i.e. if you can&#x27;t be #1 or #2) can still be a profitable strategy, but it is a bad idea for a company like Microsoft. If nothing else, it&#x27;s a distraction from their core moneymaking activities. Their first instinct would be to leverage their existing platforms to build user share, which would be a negative thing for Microsoft&#x27;s existing platforms by creating opportunity for competitors as Microsoft&#x27;s users search for alternatives (see Office on iPad). And because Microsoft has a decentralized power structure, there&#x27;s not much they can do to prevent this. They&#x27;re better off not playing in the mobile space at all than aiming to be a niche #3 -- let a smaller, more focused player with a lower cost base take on that role.<p>At some point, Microsoft will realize that mobile is a game they will never win. While they would be in a much better strategic position if they had a strong mobile presence, wishing that will happen won&#x27;t make it so. IMO their optimal move is to get in bed with both Apple and Google and make BYOD really awesome if your company uses Microsoft as a back office. Apple would do it because they have little to no presence in the enterprise tech space, and Google would have to do it because otherwise Apple would become the de-facto standard in corporate mobile phones. That position leaves Microsoft with other options and leverage over the industry, which they currently don&#x27;t have sitting at the bottom and looking up saying &quot;me too!&quot; It&#x27;s also very hard to do any of this if you&#x27;re in direct competition with Apple and Google on the OS/handset side.",1436388869

A blog is simple and having one or two people write one or two articles a week on &quot;hot&quot; topics will go a long way to generating revenue and building traffic. You should never doubt the power of a blog.<p>2. Seeing the prices is an enormous turn off. I get what you are doing and I can definitely see a benefit to being straightforward with the pricing. However, you are not building a simple 1-3 page website. You are probably getting visits from people looking for pricing comparable to the 1-3 page website, and not a mobile app.<p>You also say in the first sentence on the site your goal is to build small to medium mobile and web applications without breaking the bank, but then I see the price tag. I am not saying I don&#x27;t think your prices are fair, it is a matter of perception though. You may want to show the types of projects that can be completed with each package. Even if you are going to stick to the pricing, I would remove it entirely from the site. Put a &quot;Contact Us&quot; button there instead. This forces the customer to reach out to you, at which point you can offer them the package pricing. If they don&#x27;t seem interested based on the pricing, you are then able to speak directly with them to get an idea of what they are looking for and maybe come up with a price that does work for them. Otherwise you are potentially losing customers coming to the site, seeing the price, and leaving altogether.<p>3. Your target market is probably not going to be on Facebook. I would go after a LinkedIn crowd honestly for your advertising.<p>4. Put some case studies together for the site. It looks like you have had some pretty big name clients.<p>5. I find it difficult to price web/mobile development into a fixed price/benefit model. Every site and every company&#x27;s requirements are going to be different.

However there are other reasons to write FFIs - to benefit from Rust&#x27;s extremely powerful type system, which can all-but-guarantee a program&#x27;s correctness.<p>For example I recently spent a fortnight trying to write a parser for a complex binary file format in Q, but the dynamic typing got in the way. I would constantly find that some invariant would get broken without my understanding how, and refactoring was a matter of &quot;change this here, run until it breaks, then fix, repeat&quot;. Eventually I gave up and rewrote in Rust. It took the same amount of time but the implementation is rock solid and I am confident that it won&#x27;t ever crash and that e.g. malformed data will be identified and handled correctly.<p>I am now getting into the habit of reaching for Rust whenever I get bogged down with another language - it makes everything else seem brittle and slow.",1436387757

Transcend is doing essentially the same thing, but the goal is to produce wavelengths optimal for plant growth instead of a broad spectrum for illumination. The biggest difference in implementation looks to be that Transcend is separating the phosphor from the emitter while most LEDs used for illumination bond the phosphor directly to the emitter.",1436387299

A big problem with tech geeks is that see themselves as being unbiased and objective in all things (eg. meritocracy, best argument wins, etc), and so ironically they are more susceptible to rationalizing their own biases.

9854356,comment,9853846,9854220,0,0,eggie,,,"Mostly, CRISPR/Cas9 reduces the cost of getting a custom endonuclease (molecular scissors that cut DNA at particular sequences). It is several orders of magnitude cheaper than alternatives, and it is also incredibly quick to set up! This makes it much easier to try more experiments. Also dCas9 (partly or wholly disabled Cas9) can be used to make the system the basis for multiplex gene targeting experiments that can be used to induce entirely new regulatory networks in one step! Wow!<p>So there is a lot of good but don&#x27;t forget your question: haven&#x27;t we had this for a long time? Yes, the techniques are fundamentally the same as others which have been used for a long time. Endonuclease and homologous repair are standard tools in genome engineering. It just costs much less to design custom endonuclease now. It seems like there is a bit too much hype about CRISPR/Cas9 techniques as genome engineering tools--- we are engineering genomes in exactly the same way as before. The scissors have changed but the glue is still endogenous to the organisms that we are engineering.<p>To my knowledge there has only been one case in which DNA was shipped as code to be the genome of a dead cell. Maybe someday we will be able to write large genomes. Until then nearly all the editing we do will be in living organisms, as it has been forever (even before CRISPR/Cas9).",1436387264

Example: Vagrant box hosting, Vagrant share (requires a server), Packer builds, Packer artifact hosting, Consul UI, Consul alerts, Consul alert history, Terraform collaboration, Terraform state storage, Terraform run locks, GitHub triggering Terraform, etc. These are all features that enhance an individual HashiCorp project. I&#x27;m not going to explain each here, since they&#x27;re explained in the blog post and of course expect an understanding of that individual project.<p>Then, Atlas unifies them: code push (Git, CI, etc.) triggers an automatic Packer build which triggers a Terraform plan which triggers a Slack message asking for approval to deploy which can then be deployed with a single button which then causes the Consul UI to update with the latest info.<p>You can do this with our open source, purely, and many do. This was the inspiration behind Atlas: the companies adopting our open source projects want a complete story, and they&#x27;re building it on their own, but they&#x27;d rather buy it from us. Atlas is us delivering that full dev to prod story.<p>If you&#x27;re a HashiCorp user, Atlas is valuable if you&#x27;re using an indivual project OR if you&#x27;re looking for a complete deployment solution.<p>I hope this helps a lot more.",1436387133

9854244,comment,9851505,9853596,0,0,tel,,,"Hm, well, I suppose I&#x27;m in agreement about many things, but also a little unsure of how to interpret PFP unless it is meant to be &quot;PFP = Haskell&quot;.<p>I think the primary things I&#x27;d ask about or try to answer revolve around the use and interpretation of monads and the meaning of referential transparency.<p>Firstly, &quot;using monads&quot; is perhaps better read as &quot;being explicit about the design of the monadic context you are in&quot;. Their original use is much more about creating nice semantical interpretations of imperative programs than their practical use today in Haskell, and, in this broader context they are tremendously useful in imperative PLs.<p>Indeed, it&#x27;s perhaps proper to say that an imperative language is one where its statements can be thought of as living in what I like to call &quot;some, unstated ambient monad&quot; which has a number of control flow and stateful properties. In this sense, a lot of your argument, I believe, boils down to saying that (1) people appear to have intuition for a certain monadic context and (2) designing a language to implicitly live in that context is friendly. I agree strongly with both of those.<p>Some remaining points include a lot around how monads are implemented/interpreted in Haskell today. That&#x27;s a fine critique, but not one against the broader idea or against PFP at large.<p>Finally, wrt to referential transparency: this ultimately comes down to statements about what it means to have names and binding in your language. Strangely, such a primitive question spirals out into having enormous consequences. The nice thing about referential transparency is that it, more or less, is simpler than any other kind of name/reference that people often pick and therefore it&#x27;s a good default state IF your goal is to make everyone opt into any more sophisticated ideas.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not a personal proponent of saying anything like &quot;100% explicit is always the right answer&quot;. As noted, it&#x27;s annoying, complex, and has external impact outside of mere value-semantics matching. So, in this sense I agree a lot here.<p>But in a broader sense, I strongly believe that it&#x27;s no accident that the research behind PFP is as strong as it is. The core idea is not a CS one but instead in the free connection to logic provided by the Curry-Howard or BHK interpretations. As we design logics which are increasingly expressive and translate them to PLs we find increasingly that these PLs have properties of extreme regularity. This make them great foundational modes of which other languages should be based. I don&#x27;t think those forces will be going away.<p>But languages are not always best suited for extreme explicitness and expressiveness. Metaphor and intuition are powerful tools that languages should take advantage of. These &quot;metaphor langs&quot; can be profoundly nice, have rigorous translation to foundational language, and thus share fantastic semantics. Ultimately today that&#x27;s not so different from the embedded DSL story.",1436385840

Why should a real estate developer, and the whole horde of commissioned vampires that follow them, make 10x as much &quot;over there&quot; as &quot;over here&quot; when its the same product for the same people making mostly the same money at mostly the same jobs, just a different location?<p>Various standard of living effects, the $3M I&#x27;m not spending on similar housing in CA is improving my standard of living and retirement plans far beyond folks living there, after all its not like CA pays much more (maybe 30% tops, but the cost of living is like 2 times higher) or that stuff ordered from Amazon costs people in CA any less.  Is it fair that I get a 90th percentile national salary but because I don&#x27;t live in CA I get to experience a roughly 95th percentile lifestyle locally?<p>In post industrial world, once capital investments are worthless (capital as in giant factory, enormous milling machine, whatever its all scrap iron moved to China now) then the only worth is people, who can move around anywhere very quickly, yet they don&#x27;t.  This also impacts multi-site multi-office sized companies...  the mantra for very small companies is everyone has to be at the same site in the same place in the same open office for 12 hours a day breathing each others coughs and sneezes because thats modern business, but how this interacts with multinationals is mysterious.  I&#x27;ll be honest, I have no idea how many offices my employer has, but I assure you its very large, I can&#x27;t even be sure how many timezones...  Work no longer requires physical plant investments, so where do / should people live if they no longer need to live in walking distance of the foundry or factory?  If my boss lives and works at an office three states away, why do I need to drive 20 miles each day into an office to &quot;work&quot; &quot;with&quot; him?  Its an aspect of economic belief that is in considerable turmoil where common beliefs when mashed up against observation create all kinds of strange cognitive dissonance.",1436385613

Rust/C#/etc. vs Java. Stuff just goes faster with less effort.<p>2. The model is more &quot;programmable&quot;. Rather than select from pluggable pre-fab algorithms, with certain trade-offs already made for you, you are able to write your own code where you need it. The system runs your code and really not that much else.<p>Stay tuned for when we actually push that content out.",1436385608

426454,comment,426153,426153,0,0,gommm,,,"Well you have japanese or french companies where they make your work a nightmare until you quit (supposing you're a seishain or have a cdi). The possibilities are endless, you can give them very uninterresting and boring work to do or give them an extremely cramped space that is too small to work...<p>Or you can do what my old company did (but to be fair they didn't have much of a choice it seems) and just ask all employees to cut their salary in half or quit (glad I quit a few month before that....)<p>Or, you can just decide that after all living in a country were firing is not too difficult provides more benefits than problems and that being fired is not much more damaging psychologically than being pressured to quit because they can't fire you.",1231497839

(Counting program, website, accounts, etc.)<p>I think that was probably my most productive workweek in my entire life, and it was only about 50 hours, too.  (50 hours on top of the day job, which left me pretty freaking wrecked.  Then again compared to some of the startups I read about I feel like I'm either a pitiful excuse for a founder or, in the alternative, merely sane.)<p>[I tried to roughly the same thing this summer, and get a new project out the door in 30 days.  Now <i>that</i> was a serving of humble pie.]",1231497066

The beacon of scalability you hold up for us to gaze at in awe, Twitter, fixed just about all of its scalability problems with SQL caching. That's SQL caching, also known as 'bypassing Rails'. If you can't reduce the known facts to this obvious conclusion, you have no business arguing about scalability.",1239281967

He's easily offset the purchase of the iPhone, developer account, and maybe even computer. On top of that, he has an extremely valuable research project feeding him data on the app store and his users. He's learned some lessons that I'm sure will help smooth the release of his future more ambitious (and hopefully lucrative) work. I'll bet his game will have a ""lite"" version for sure now, whereas he might otherwise not known how important that can be to drive revenue of the full price version. The app is also quite valuable as a motivator. I know I get discouraged from time to time working on my app thinking that nobody is going to buy it. I'm certain I would have more gusto if I was watching sales numbers from a simple app roll in, even if they were incredibly modest.",1239281811

The usual IT factors of lock-in, path dependency and network effects have their place. As does the frequently underestimated, yet monumental task of getting effective interoperation even when all parties are willing and able to do so (neither of which is generally the case).<p>Minor browser engines such as Webkit, Gecko and Opera can't change the market much on their own. They need to be interoperable to some degree for people to start using their additions to the standards on the wider web. HTML5 (nee WHAT-WG) was initially those browser vendors coming together to work on exactly that.<p>You give Canvas as an implementation before standardization example, yet it was far more iterative than that with Apple's original implementation (for use in the walled garden of their widgets) being presented for standardization with the explicit idea that it was good for Apple if there were interoperable implementations out there.<p>It's a pretty good example of Co-opetition.

In this case, ""security concerns"" are defined as: ""the club by which a corporate IT department can beat down a reasonable request without being forced to have an intelligent discussion"". All machines had monitoring software that phoned home regularly to tell IT what software you were running.<p>Most average employees just need to get their work done, so they are not going to risk a fight with the IT machine over a browser.

554256,comment,553065,553065,0,0,zcrar70,,,"I actually think that this article is confusing two things, the fact that the technology has evolved to make music more accessible (even omnipresent), and the fact that there are a lot of people producing music at the moment. Whilst one may have facilitated the other, the effects the author describes in the article are due sometimes to one, sometimes to the other (e.g. the overwhelming amount of bands at SXSW is due to the large amount of music being produced at the moment, the fact that music is now everywhere -in shops, on the radio, on screens in public places, on YouTube or MySpace- is due to the technology facilitating music distribution.)<p>My problem is not so much with the fact that music is available everywhere as with the fact that most of it isn't very good - the commercial impetus behind most modern (pop) music means that there isn't a lot of variety (because record companies apply their own fitness functions, going for 'proven' formulas), and the emphasis on immediate commercial success puts more emphasis on tangential factors (production values, marketing etc) than on the music itself. So, I'm worried that although the availability of music has increased, its value to society (i.e. its cultural and intellectual benefits) may actually have diminished.",1239279657

YouTube solved a simple but not easy problem: how can you let the mainstream share videos and search for videos.

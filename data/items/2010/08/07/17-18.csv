1583938,comment,1583935,1583935,0,0,cesare,,,"Q: What patents are related to the 555?<p>A: There are no patents on the 555.  Signetics did not want to apply for a patent.  You see, the situation with patents in Silicon Valley in 1970 was entirely different than it is now. Everybody was stealing from everybody else.  I designed the 555 Signetics produced it, and six months, or before a year later, National had it, Fairchild had it, and nobody paid any attention to patents.   The people at Signetics told me they didn’t want to apply for a patent, because what would happen if they tried to enforce that patent, is the people from Fairchild would come back with a Manhattan-sized telephone book and say “These are our patents, now let’s see what you’re violating”. It was a house of cards – if you blew on it, the whole thing collapsed.  It took about ten years to change. I guess it was some new companies that didn’t have ancient history and did have a strong patent, and started enforcing, and that changed to whole situation.  It is very intense now. The same thing – I have a patent on the phase locked loop, and that would have been a very strong patent, but no enforcement.",1281203960

1583933,comment,1583673,1583896,0,0,akeefer,,,"I don't think we should change how we write code, either:  I think we should change the patent system so this stuff doesn't happen.  I get tired of hearing the ""it's just big companies suing other big companies"" argument about why patents aren't a problem.  Software patents generally don't stifle innovation because people don't do something because they're worried about patents:  they stifle innovation by diverting huge financial and mental resources to patent lawsuits (and patent filing) that could otherwise go to product development or something else useful, and occasionally by crippling companies that aren't large enough to defend themselves.  It's just kind of tax on the industry as a whole where the net effect is to siphon money and energy away from important things and towards lawyers.  You'd have approximately the same effect if you replaced the patent system with roving bands of feral lawyers that went around randomly destroying property and burning down offices.  You wouldn't say, ""Hmm, I don't think I'll write software because some lawyer might burn my house down,"" but dealing with all that destruction would drain resources from other areas, and sometimes it would be too much for a company to overcome.<p>I can't really get into any specifics of the litigation because it's still ongoing.",1281203826

I think it'd hold up well enough for a few simple tests to make sure I didn't break anything.  If you had read the blog post, I made this clear in numerous places, but obviously you didn't read the whole thing (or you're hoping other people have not read the whole thing).<p>Next, since I'm just testing the code to make sure I didn't break it, I just need to slam an older version and a newer version.  Since they'll be tested in the same way, it should give me enough data to know.  Even though there could be contention on the machine, with 4 cores it should be good enough to figure out if I screwed something up.  Additionally, Mongrel2 does aggressive caching of files, so I'm really narrowing it down to just the poll code by hitting a small file.<p>All that combined with doing multiple runs and looking at the performance between them and for an evening of testing I've done enough to make sure it's not broken.  That's it.  I'm pretty damn sure you did that when testing your ""Homage To Zed named FU"" but hey, gotta hold the people you dislike to higher standards then yourself right?<p>Now, when I get Mongrel2 to a state where it's a real web server, that I actually wrote, rather than stole from Yaws and claimed I wrote, I'll let you know.  I'll make sure to setup a massive EC2 cluster and test all the possible permutations a guy like you thinks are necessary to prove that it actually serves files.<p>Until then, this will do just fine to make sure that I'm not breaking anything.",1281203576

So our realistic choices were Perl or compiled code. Nowadays Python has become a ""normal"" language and no-one bats an eyelid when I list it as a prereq.

It attracted some interest, and was even Slashdotted a couple of times over the years.  Between Slashdottings one and two a company applied for a patent on the idea of connecting laundry machines to web servers.  Much later, after our dorms laundry server had been in operation for about a decade, they sent us a cease and desist letter.  We informed them that they'd lose their patent if they took us to court and didn't suffer, but they are still charging people millions of dollars for the system their invalid patent gives them a monopoly on.<p>After I got my Master's I started work at a consultancy that did custom sensors.

This is so true; even in the early 70s the system was broken, and I got only so much out of the university offerings by themselves.<p>But I got a <i>lot</i> of use out of my roommates.  High school had been a homogeneous environment, everyone taking the same stuff and enduring the same assignments, preparing for the same standardized tests.  But at university I was suddenly thrown in with people with different specializations, different expertise, different interests.  I found myself taking meals with electrical engineers, mathematicians, political science observers, religious people, educators, psychologists, physicists, chemists... and I could pick the brains of <i>any</i> of them.  I was like a kid in a candy store.<p>And that's not all: I discovered the pain and pleasure of ethanol.  I walked in the moonlight through a cypress forest discussing existentialism with a platonic girlfriend.  I acquired some rudimentary burglary skills.  I broadened my musical tastes.  I learned to eat stuff that wasn't mama food.  You can't do any of that these days, sitting in your parents' basement and skulking the intarweb.<p>The community made university worthwhile, not most of the academic stuff that was routinely delivered as part of a contrived degree requirement.

The IDE and refactoring support you can gain from this is in no way inferior to what you can do with a dead, static blueprint system.<p>My preferred language has dynamic typing, but its common implementations also do type inference at compile time, in order to optimize generic operations, and to warn about things that cannot work.  Since during development I only recompile the snippet I am working on, while the rest of the system is running on, the compiler can use all the type information available from the running system.",1281201865

Technically, the project was a success as all the technical obstacles were overcome and aircraft's performance figures improved significantly, but the project was scuppered in the end by Klimov's apparent inability to get the engine's reliability and ease of maintenance to anywhere close to that of the aging Snecma Atar 09K50s originally fitted to the aircraft. The conclusion in the end was that if the SA Air Force wanted to go ahead with the project it would need to stockpile a large quantity of spare engines and other parts and swap them out frequently, something that introduced enough cost and difficulty to negate the performance gains that would've been achieved, so the project was shelved.<p>The SA Air Force has remained wary of Russian military equipment ever since.

For example, this blog (<a href=""http://rpxcorp.com/blog/?p=129"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rpxcorp.com/blog/?p=129</a>), whose accuracy I have no idea of, claims that the average total cost of a patent lawsuit where the potential damages are under $25MM is $3.1MM to defend yourself, and $6.2MM if the potential damages are over that number.<p>So there are several parts to this equation.  1) Creating any bit of software involves thousands of ""inventions,"" any one of which could be patentable.  2) Patents are granted for things which fail the obviousness test, where the chance of someone else independently ""inventing"" the same thing is essentially 100%.  3) The damages for violating even one patent tend to be astronomical and totally out of line with the contribution of that ""invention"" to the software in question.  Out of 2 million lines of code, if one total BS patent covers 20 lines of that code, why are the damages likely to be basically equivalent to most of the revenue for that product?  4) The cost of defending against a patent lawsuit is enormous.<p>In other words:  if you're a small software business, then there's pretty much a 100% chance someone else can sue you for patent infringement if they want to, losing the case will kill your company, and trying to defend yourself will severely drain your resources and could kill your company anyway.<p>There's no part of that that helps or encourages innovation.",1281201276

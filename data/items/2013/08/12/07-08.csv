6198134,comment,6197823,6197980,12,0,fusiongyro,,,"The two things aren&#x27;t especially commensurate. A lot of the fun of Haskell is type-level stuff, which is resolved by the compiler at compile-time. There are no direct run-time artifacts. Moreover, several of the things Ed talks about have to do with concurrency, which isn&#x27;t even something you can do with Ruby. Speculative execution and STM both enable real multicore concurrent processing. Even if it did perform as badly as Ruby, without the GIL and with real concurrency it&#x27;s in a better position. Adding complexity in the type level does have one major performance effect though, which is on compile time. Does it count as fast and scalable if the compile time reaches into the minutes? In terms of compilation time, Ruby will always beat Haskell, because it doesn&#x27;t have any. This is a meaningful difference when you&#x27;re trying to iterate rapidly on your webapp, but most of the web frameworks for Haskell separate out templating to help with this problem.<p>Most people eventually complain that high-performance Haskell doesn&#x27;t resemble the Haskell we&#x27;re taught to program. This is less and less true as things like iteratee-based I/O and really advanced libraries like bytestring and text displace older facilities, but it is still something to think about. Haskell tends to perform well by sacrificing lots of memory. This is why you see discussion about &quot;space leaks&quot; rather than &quot;memory leaks&quot; and whatnot. There are a lot of ways to address the problems that come up, but you need to have a strong handle on the way Haskell works before you can accurately diagnose and treat the problem. This is a significant barrier to using Haskell in production. It doesn&#x27;t take long to acquire the expertise to throw Ruby into production. The road with Haskell is a bit longer and a bit more taxing, because it&#x27;s so very foreign.",1376293895

Would love to take a look, as judging by the logo the design was nice indeed :)<p>Congratulations on winning the Hackathon! Did you participate in the December Finals in Palo Alto and this blogpost is just many months late, or have they started a new round competition? If it's the former, I believe we've met (I was on the UW team), if it's the latter, best of luck!<p>My experience at the Facebook Hackathon was very similar - I was the only Freshman to enter, our team had been cobbled together entirely by chance (2/4 were found by posting on reddit). We were some of the last to demo, and every one that preceded us seemed, at least to me, far more technically impressive. People had built real time games, written web-servers, designed Android apps to handle streaming video, but (almost) no one had a use-case. We essentially strung together API on top of API in some of the most hacky code I've ever written[1], and somehow it all came together in the end to a) work for the demo and b) seem like something people would actually use. Our idea for the final round was far more derivative and banal, and we lost because of it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/nickbarnwell/SpunBy.Me"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nickbarnwell/SpunBy.Me</a>",1338695908

They fail because they're 'super inspired' and 'totally passionate' and 'serial entrepreneurs'.  They fail because they're not losing sleep over how well they execute their sales funnel.<p>Don't get me wrong, my favorite line in startups is that 'optimism builds companies, pessimism keeps them operating'.

There are some trials where crossover to the active treatment is not permitted, and patients may die without getting it. The problem is that if you allow crossover, usually that means that the trial will not show a difference in overall survival, paradoxically because the treatment works really well. Regulatory bodies such as the FDA demand positive survival data in some cancers before they will approve a treatment. So it can be a difficult ethical issue, because although it sounds terrible to deprive the placebo group of treatment, if you don't prove it works then it won't get approved and nobody will get it outside of the trial.<p>The investigators didn't say whether they allowed crossover in this trial. It probably doesn't matter too much, because abiraterone is already approved and available at the moment for use after patients have had chemotherapy with docetaxel. So for example, patients that progressed on this trial could go on to receive docetaxel which might control their disease for a while, and then after that they could access abiraterone, so they wouldn't necessarily miss out. Is it better to have abiraterone and then docetaxel, or to have docetaxel and then abiraterone? That's an open question, which may never get tested in a clinical trial. Generally the order doesn't matter as much as being exposed to all the agents that are active. In an elderly patient who is a bit frail, I think most patients and doctors would prefer to use abiraterone up front rather than chemo, which has more side effects.",1338692885

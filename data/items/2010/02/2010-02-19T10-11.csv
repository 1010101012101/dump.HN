This means that whilst you can't sell anything you make with it, you can get your hands on the full Unreal 3.0 engine that powers many modern games (eg. Gears of War, Bioshock 2), and do whatever you like with it. Great for prototyping, experimenting and generally learning about game development.",1266577069

I was excited to use Google's new tools/toys on the phone like Goggles, Turn-by-turn directions, and Buzz.<p>When those applications didn't show up in the android app market, I found out it was because I had Android 1.5 running on my phone and all the cool stuff is for 2.0.  'No problem, I'll update,' says me.<p>About that.  You can download the latest Three branded software from HTC.  I borrowed a friends Windows PC to do the update, since that's the only platform supported (ironic, since Android unix based).  I allowed HTC Sync to erase my data (the only option) and update, only to find I'd updated to the version I already had.  Version numbers are tricky; the phone's software have three different numbers and I had no idea which one referred to the Android firmware.<p>'OK maybe I'll try a less conventional route.' Lots of looking around helped me find out that although people used to be able to update these phones by rooting them, my phone's software had closed that door with a patch.  I'm not one to give up easily when it comes to winning with technology, but I only have so many days to live on this Earth...<p>I have found a recent blog post suggesting that HTC will provide an update for my phone (for a different carrier, but who knows?) in March.  Oh well, I'm still enjoying the phone.  I guess the Lord is teaching me patience.<p>As for the tricksy title of this post, I know that Android is more open from a developer perspective, but on the iPhone, everyone has access to OS and application updates at once, which can be installed from two different platforms.",1266576607

So now we have at least two classes of apps that use their own standard config storage. Getting rid of GConf would mean <i>all</i> of those apps would use their own config storage, creating even more fragmentation. That would be better, how?<p>> Pardon me, but ""instant apply"" feature is not enough to excuse for this mess: yeah, I change something in Gconf and maybe 20% of apps pick up my change instantly. A whopping 20%, but INSTANTLY, was that the goal?<p>No idea where you pulled the 20% number from. It's always 100% in my experience with the exception of Firefox and font settings.<p>> They should have ALL kept using standard /etc<p>/etc is not a standard. Did you ignore what everybody else has been saying?<p>> + ~/.xxrc files<p>Oh like ~/.gconf?<p>> or came to an agreement to use something truly global, so I could enjoy the same font rendering or a freaking window colors in Skype and Pidgin. I can live without instant config changes but at least I could have grepped ""color"" and ""window"" appearing on the same line somewhere in /etc and in ~/.gtk or ~/.kde.<p>Agreed, but this problem has got nothing to do with GConf. Getting rid of the GConf you so hate will not solve this very problem.<p>> Tools like GConf are destroying one of the greatest UNIX strengths: scriptability.<p>gconf-tool. Completely scriptable. Enjoy.<p>> I keep versions of config files for selected software under git and simply push it to /etc when I need to quickly set up a new machine.<p>Put ~/.gconf in git. Enjoy.<p>> Nobody needs freaking ""pluggable back-ends"" because everybody needs to be able to instantly backup/restore selected applications configuration in a standard way<p>Yeah, if only those stupid GConf files are backup-able with standard tools like 'cp' or 'tar'! Oh wait... they are!<p>> And is it really worth it to run a freaking daemon so you can see your config changes instantly take effect?<p>It is really worth requiring an entire windowing system and fancy graphics just so one can see images in a web browser? We should just stick with telnet dammit!<p>Yes. Why not run a daemon? It eats maybe a few hundred KB of private RSS. Even an old desktop system by today's standard has 256 MB of RAM. The daemon also improves startup performance by caching a small set of active configuration settings in memory instead of having to constantly load them from disk, something which is not possible if every app parses the config files.<p>> Why not PDF?<p>Why PDF? I'll tell you why not PDF, because it's not a good format for storing config, what's why! You said there are lots of tools for editing PDF - but none of them are usable for editing key-value pairs. As opposed to XML tools. If the XML file hard to read? Use xmllint to reformat or to indent it. Edit with a standard text editor. grep, sed, awk, all work, I have no idea what you're talking about.<p>No, I think your fear for 2010 technology and your tendency to stick with 1970s stuff is more of a disease.",1266576333

If you profit from it, that is good enough for me, as it validates the strength of my ideas. I don't want to receive anything from the people who do the hard work to make money from it. That is the reason for the CC license, so that someone can take an idea, profit from it, and not have to worry about lawsuits down the way. I am still trying to see if there is a better option to reassure people that they won't need to worry about me coming along and saying ""Hey, my idea, throw me some cash!!!"" This is especially important if someone takes an idea and has to look for finance later.
You have hit the nail on the head regarding the website. In researching other websites on ideas out there, there are a crap load of sites where people put up one-line ideas, with no thought of implementation. Due to the years of work I've done creating CMS, CRM and ERP software, behind the site will be an IMS (idea management system) that hopefully will force people to take their idea through my system from ""spark"" to implementation. 
I am a strong believer in competition making us stronger. So I want to put my ideas out there to see if someone can beat me to implementation. I think that could give me extra impetus to solidly push my ideas out.

Not only do you benefit from the fit, the girls recognise the brands.<p>I judge the fit of the jeans that I buy by putting my keys/wallet/phone in my pockets when trying them on to make sure that the jeans fits properly in the typical conditions that I'll be wearing them.  Also note that your jeans will stretch slightly as you wear them, but that is brand/material dependent.<p><i>Do not get jeans that are too long.

I'm short and have short legs, so I counter the length of my jeans by wearing slightly bulkier shoes.

If you find as nice/nicer shoes that didn't appear on that page when you're out and about shopping, get those before the crowd-sourced ones.  Why?

If you were to strip out everything 'not needed' for a basic server, I expect you would end up 'running' about 40k LOC, which I think is 'inline' with others like varnish/lighttpd/etc<p>apache's problem isn't bloat, its architecture and bad sysadmins.  it was designed from 1994 for prefork-based systems, and sysadmins have been configuring it since then, or not configuring it.  Yes, it will use lots of ram when you embed Python and PHP in it, so don't do that.<p>mini-rant over, and a disclaimer: i am an httpd committer.",1266574461

In fact, he recently got kicked off of Southwestern Airlines for being too fat.   Now, you'll never look at Kevin Smith and think he's fashionable.  But you wont think he's a slob either.  His strategy is to take care of his face, choose glasses that fit his body type, get a good haircut, wear black, and wear layers.

As a platform for just building your company website I now view it as poorly suited, just because the constant patching of your plugins never seems to end.<p>A hosted Drupal solution that did a good job of taking that pain away, while still giving you the flexibility of having any plugins you want would be nice product IMO.",1266573777

They just want to do what they want to do easily.<p>My Dad happily got the job done in word perfect and i comfortably used a browser (until the os crashed) on Windows 3.1.<p>I agree with you on Finder's irritations. Gnome's nautilous puts finder and explorer to shame in my opinion. But it has little irritations of it's own. I did notice recently that in Windows7 explorer would carry on copying files rather than terminating on error; about time!<p>It's been said; that Windows omitted the security model in earlier pc's as they didn't forsee home pcs connecting the web. Hardware and cost also must have also been a limitation for earlier os's.<p>I used to do sys admin, and I was forever trying to lock down windows, i.e limited accounts, but it would break the apps or make them error or buggy. That's not really Microsoft's problem; unless they didn't provide adequate documentation. It's poor implementation. Likewise I've seen printers not working under limited accounts; I even saw a hilarious fix: make the whole system dir totally read/writable! To cut a long story short it riled me so much; I left windows.<p>People went from no security to a locked down system; that they found plain irritating. Whereas in OSX there is one simple system preferences panel, that asks for your password if you do anything that requires root privileges. Windows config is nasty until you learn it. Then they change it in each incarnation with the eventual itteration resembling a turd. Don't start me on Linux desktop implementations.<p>Also the security model on Windows feels the wrong way around. It should be locked down and slowly opened to trusted apps. But as you say perhaps that's finally been overhauled.<p>My mate uses win98 as he can get his job done easily. He can reset his os in seconds as it is so small. I wouldn't use it, but it's fine for him. About the only reason he  might shift is for firefox, but he recently said he's found some compatibility layer that let's him run some modern apps. Hilarious. I don't know how he copes without a command line, but he does.<p>Don't get me wrong, there have been some leaps and bounds, but from my perspective, I'd rather a simple system; that works; that I can tweak if i want, that is portable, interoperable, that is fast and intuitive to use rather than a machine with oodles of power just to watch a high def movie or provide a transparent window, with drop shadows.",1266573710

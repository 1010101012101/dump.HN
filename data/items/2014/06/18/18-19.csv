Even an uneducated consumer will rapidly realize that they don&#x27;t have access to Google&#x27;s apps, or Apple&#x27;s apps, or even many common third-party apps that they&#x27;re used to having, and the contract price puts it on par with an iPhone 5S/Samsung S5—i.e., it&#x27;s got premium pricing, despite its inferior ecosystem.<p>That said, I have to admit that being able to give my parents a smart phone with 10-second delays to talk to a human is tempting.

I saw a 3D screen on a phone at a party at CES and I was impressed by the quality and useful ness compared to 3D TV. 3D makes much more sense on a smaller size screen because you add more real-estate with the other dimension.<p>Another interesting feature is that the phone is designed for use with one hand. To achieve this, it uses integrated gesture control, for example, tilt the screen to get more information or to access menus.<p>The phone a scanning system called Firefly that can be activated by a button and is able to identify products from photos (100 million items) and barcodes. This will make the phone extra dangerous to retail stores that are already losing sales to &quot;showrooming&quot;.<p>The phone also features dual dolby digital speakers (one on each side) for surround sound when watching horizontally. They are also providing access to Prime Video catalog and store for unlimited pictures via their cloud services.<p>They are focusing on customer service and help by providing the MayDay 24/7/365 tech support for the phone. It sounds like agents can do a sort of screen share with the phone and guide users along. This will help adoption by people who are typically not good with operating new technologies.<p>The phone seems pretty cool and unique and with Amazon&#x27;s ability to market it directly to their customers, it is sure to do well.",1403117918

It might be something that happened long time ago (3 - 6 months) surfacing now. And when it is happening, you might not pay attention to it, you might be inclined to overlook. (citation needed)<p>Citation or not, this is something that people overlook constantly.  Sometimes the resistance/fight or flight mechanisms in our brains will get us through truly awful stuff, only to start really being bothered by it months later when we have the free brain power to think about it.<p>Also worth noting, is that sometimes really GOOD life events can be stressful as well.  Landing a new job, finding a new partner, etc., all of those things (or perhaps wanting to keep those new things in place) can also add onto the stress pile much more significantly than others see.  The real kicker is that there just aren&#x27;t very many people you can vent about it to or seek advice from when you&#x27;re talking about how great everything is, and how much it bugs you.  It&#x27;s something I make a point to watch out for when I talk to friends and peers.

So their return profile looks like:  if Uber is worth anything more than a couple billion dollars (which they may view as near-certain), they get their money back + interest.  Then they hold an option should Uber execute like Amazon, as others have suggested, and dramatically exceed their near-term market potential.<p>Valuing this is quite tricky:  presumably the people who invested $250M less than a year ago thought:  I only have to clear ~$400M to get my bait back, now that number is 3-4x higher.<p>While it is highly likely that the new investors have some sort of preferred return, it&#x27;s possible (though less likely) that have a participating preferred or some other more complex instrument.  Maybe the market price for straight preferred was &quot;only&quot; $12B valuation, and the company said: &quot;How about we &#x27;guarantee&#x27; you a 2x return, with a participating preferred instrument, but we want a 50% higher price, so in an upside case we are diluted less?&quot;<p>This stuff is pretty common in these later rounds, though admittedly more on the &quot;bubble unicorns&quot; than the true unicorns, who have utmost market leverage.

If you can create some aspirational value for early users, that can work wonders. For example, the fact that facebook was exclusive to Harvard made it aspirational for others. Another trick is to make the entry invitation based, and let every new member invite a few others. Need for invitation creates aspiration and allowance of 10 creates social gratification for those who join. Of course, execution of these strategies is an art in itself.",1403116752

The product would&#x27;ve been a very different one without it.  We had designed a federated system that worked at the level of the Web and let any website serve as an identity provider.  In theory, this was going to change how the web worked, and that change would also be accessible to other search engines and spiders.  We didn&#x27;t accomplish that.  The request to make it only work with G+ basically involved restricting that system so that one of the URLs must be &quot;plus.google.com&quot;.<p>OTOH, this did subsequently simplify the system a lot, and enabled follow-on features that wouldn&#x27;t have been feasible under the original design.  Our original design defined an author as a clique of webpages that all linked to each other using rel=author|contributor backlinks; defining a primary key is challenging in this situation, because you have to carry along the identity of the clique throughout the system.  Requiring G+ let us key everything to an author&#x27;s Google login, which then opens up the possibility of other systems using that data easily.  It let us display the author&#x27;s profile picture (which was the primary &quot;boon&quot; to get authors to participate), and connect their works to their G+ profile so they could easily advertise everything they&#x27;d done.  It helped in marketing and using the product, because basically nobody outside Google (and only like 4 people inside Google) actually understood the author-closure stuff.<p>Understand, also the historical context behind this.  2011 was the year of &quot;Open systems lose.&quot;  Android (the open-source operating system) was playing catch-up to iOS (the closed one), and arguably only caught up because they were willing to close off much of it.  Facebook had used GMail&#x27;s &quot;download contacts&quot; feature to populate their own social graph, and then systematically cut off every attempt to crawl their own, also disallowing users from exporting their friends list to Google.  OpenSocial had been trying to gain adoption for 3-4 years and failed so badly that Google+ was necessary.  OpenID was dead-on-arrival, and Facebook Connect was taking over the web.  Google had just sunk two years into providing real-time search of Tweets, only to have Twitter pull the plug on the deal and sink the project.<p>So in hindsight, it&#x27;s difficult for me to say that the execs made the wrong call.  I was kinda ambivalent at the time - I wasn&#x27;t pleased, but I could see the reasons behind it and agreed to help out with the implementation.  A number of my teammates were furious and quit the project, moving to other departments.",1403115292

The local anarchists did not attack the police first, but they were perfectly happy to trash buildings from coffee shops to convenience stores in furtherance of their disbelief in the idea of private property. Earlier last year, similarly minded people were perfectly happy to protest the shooting by police of a wanted criminal who produced a gun while running away from a transit fare inspector by trashing a subway station in San Francisco and smashing the ticket and fare machines: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2P5LIrFDXc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2P5LIrFDXc</a><p>The person who got shot was on the run from Washington state, where he had raped and killed his ex-girlfriend. When challenged by a fare inspector he ran from the bus, produced and brandished a gun, then tripped and shot himself in the neck. The resulting protests, though ostensibly about police brutality (non-existent in this case), were organized by the same people who oppose any kind of transit fare increase ever and are continually trying to gin up civil disobedience actions with slogans such as 'can't pay - won't pay.'<p>I'm more familiar with their ideology than I want to be because they make a habit of plastering my neighborhood in Oakland with their 'revolutionary' agit-prop (using plaster makes them almost impossible to remove and creates an eyesore as the paper rots away over a period of a year or so). They also like to plaster and spray-paint their views on top of local community art projects like murals, on the theory that their revolutionary messages are 'more important.'<p>Fuck these people.

The first point is that there is more going on than simply applying yourself. And the second point is that whatever that is, it has to do with your personality.<p>To the first point: If there was a recipe to greatness (the Amadeus, Shakespeare, Einstein, Goedel, Knuth kind) then everybody would simply do it and we'd be a race of supermen. So obviously any argument for the existence of such a recipe has to be fundamentally flawed.<p>This presents us with a paradox, as we do know that great people did apply themselves to become what they are, and we know that within bounds everybody is equipped with the same mental facilities. How do we reconcile this?<p>To the second point: Great people applied themselves over decades and tens of thousands of hours. This level of commitment can neither be forced upon you, nor can you make yourself do it with discipline. You will have to find a drive inside yourself to do it. All things being equal and your personality being fully formed as you enter your teens, the answer obviously is that how that happens is your personality.<p>You cannot predict how the personality of a person will interact with that persons life and goals, so there is no ""identifyable"".

The problem domain here is a <i></i>lot<i></i> more complex than anything we'd normally call a ""plugin architecture"".  IMO, the problem is that this sort of interoperability pretty much requires the power of a full-on programming environment.  If it's even possible, I think it also requires an architectural organization that no one's yet divined.<p>The notable successes tend to be domain-specific and manifest as end-user programming environments.  The spreadsheet might be considered a weak example of this.  It has a clear user model that allows for powerful extensibility, but doesn't really facilitate ""interoperability"" in any meaningful way -- each spreadsheet tends to be a one-off.<p>The Max/MSP (and Pure Data/Pd) environments for audio/visual signal and event processing are perhaps more successful in that they allow the simultaneous construction of UI and logic in a visual programming environment. A program (aka ""patch"") can be built as a reusable sub-program that manifests the same kind of interface as the primitive (native-code) modules.  But again, this is another narrow domain application with a specific visual-semantic model which works well for that domain.  That contrasts to the OP's problem of adding arbitrary UI to a software whose main domain has nothing inherently to do with either the added UI or even to programming.<p>I'd also say that the venerable programmable programmer's editors, Emacs and Vim, form another category of end-user programming environment with loose interoperable modules.  These are certainly subject to a fairly high degree of extensibility within their domains.  But these are saddled by frustrating UI constraints and architectural models inherited from their now ancient origins.  Interoperability between ""modules"", such as it is, is largely ad-hoc and far from guaranteed.<p>Each of these successes can teach us something about what works for these kind of programmable-framework environments.  But to achieve The One Architecture To Rule Them All goes beyond simply having the tools of design, architecture, language, and environment.  It must also become a computing platform, where by ""platform"" I mean an ecosystem that's large enough to have the <i>social</i> synergies that make the above examples and other conventional software platforms successful.",1356300961

But the tuition hikes that were being protested, well, I was paying more tuition 20 years ago in British Columbia, Canada than Quebec students would have paid.  I have little sympathy with the student protests about tuition.  Furthermore I am personally of the political belief that the culture of widespread entitlement in Quebec is among the reasons that it is much worse off economically than the rest of the country.<p>Note, this is coming from someone who, while I was in Canada, was politically fairly far to the left.  And Canada is fairly far to the left of the United States.  This is not the time or place to debate it, but in the case of Quebec my opinions are shaped in part by the separatist movement there.  I grew up with friends whose families left Quebec due to Bill 101, which is likely the most racist law passed anywhere in North America in my lifetime.  Before objecting, go read it, and educate yourself on why the Bank of Montreal is now headquartered in Toronto, and what economic impacts that has had on Montreal.<p>It didn't help that the value of my Canadian sourced scholarship dropped sharply due to the the widespread belief in Quebec during the early 90s that they had the right to take not only their marbles, but all of the marbles that they had been given while abandoning all of the debts that they had run up, on a straight majority vote.  (One of those marbles being a lot of land with good hydroelectric power, built on land given under the condition that they take good care of the natives, with natives who voted 99.7% that if Quebec left Canada, they would leave Quebec.)  Yes, I am sure that you see things differently and think that Quebec was entitled to do that.

But you've added some real bloopers of your own:<p><i>> If we have a standard-issue modern currency, ie: slow but steady rate of inflation targeted by a central bank, then some amount of new money enters the economy each year. As long as total new savings in the year don't exceed this amount, then and only then can everyone save at the same time.</i><p>This is not true. Not even close. First, you are conflating two different concepts: (a) an increase in the money supply and (b) inflation. Inflation is often the result of an increase in the money supply, but that's not what it is: inflation is an increase in how much stuff costs. That is, it's a general increase in prices.<p>And prices can move broadly in one direction or another for many reasons other than a change in the supply of money; the price-level depends also on how fast money circulates, on the level of supply and demand for goods and services, and on all sorts of related factors.<p>Second, the possibility of saving does not depend on an increase in the supply of money. Doubtless you are thinking of saving in accounting terms: to save means to have more money later than you have now, so in aggregate that must mean that there needs to be more money in the economy tomorrow than there is today.<p>No. Saving is one side of the saving-investment process, which is about doing useful work and creating new things. That work and those things are abstractly called <i>wealth</i> and have <i>value</i>; wealth and value can be denominated in money, and people use money to facilitate the transfer of different sorts of wealth. But wealth is not money, and saving is about accumulating wealth, not money.<p>You're absolutely correct that if saving were merely about financial wealth, about increasing one's ""value on paper"", then we would need more money to gain wealth as a society. But it's not, and we don't need more money to accumulate wealth as a society precisely because it's not the money we value, but the <i>things</i> and the <i>results</i> of useful work. And so people trade their money for new things and results, and we can grow wealthier without increasing the money supply.<p><i>> In a gold-backed inherently-deflationary currency without fractional reserve banking or government fiat to create inflation.... all savings is zero-sum.</i><p>On the savings part, see above. On the part of about a gold-backed currency, or really any commodity currency, here's the thing: they're not inherently deflationary, or even fixed in supply. It's just that growth of the money supply is tied to things like improvements in mining technology or the results of prospecting. What I find really funny when I hear Ron Paul or somebody advocate a return to the gold standard and the abolition of the Federal Reserve is that they're really arguing for handing over monetary policy to the mining industry!<p><i>> Deflation is bad for the same reason inflation is bad, namely that an unexpected change in currency value alters the real terms of almost all business contracts ex post facto.</i><p>Yes, right.

It is this cycle that teaches us\nthat nothing, not even inflation, is permanent.

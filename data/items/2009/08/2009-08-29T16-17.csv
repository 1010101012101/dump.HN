Is there a reason why research is a monopoly of academic bureaucrats called PhDs? There is no reason for this. The best reasearchers do research for the love of it not for career. Best researchers are independent.<p>Freeing the research from academic domination will lead to immense advance in our knowledge. Wikipedia showed that freeing the organization of the known knowledge from the monopoly of the academic middlemen is a good thing. Let's do the same for the unknown knowledge. A research factory employing a huge number of unskilled workers trained to do one thing well (instead of an unnecessary and long academic education) will solve research problems faster and cheaper. Let's eliminate the middlemen in research.<p>I wrote about this research factory here.<p><a href=""http://zeynel1.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/research-factory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zeynel1.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/research-factory/</a>",1251565196

793361,comment,793124,793209,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, from what I've witnessed, humour is usually used in a form of empathising with peers or a form of group-initiation (new people tend to get poked fun of to see if they're good natured vis a vis a good fit in the group). I tell the joke about how I set a boiling pan of water alight (it's true, and I'm not sure how) because I'm a far better cook than most of my friends; I use the joke to actually reduce any social imbalance because I make it at my own expense. I could easily make a joke at my friend's expense, but then we likely wouldn't be friends for very long.<p>There is a very big difference between being fun and making fun. The OP IMO is way off, perhaps this is the social norm in Germany, but in Anglo-culture most jokes are self-deprecating. It's rare that aggressive (belittling or demeaning) jokes are made and go over well, people in senior positions using this type of humour are at risk, in fact it's one of the main reasons employers get sued because it frequently creates a hostile work environment. If you think your joke is so funny that you want to get sued over it, well I believe it's still a self-depreciating joke, because either way the joke ended up on you, but it depreciated your bank account too.<p>The few exceptions when aggressive jokes are allowed and found funny is usually between close friends or family and it's usually classed as a roasting joke where the entire point is that they're respected <i>more</i> for showing their good nature.<p>Comedy on TV is very different from comedy in real life. The reason why most doctors don't crack jokes is because they're insured to work, if they start insulting their subordinates with aggressive jokes, their insurance goes up and the same is with almost any antisocial behaviour, because the insurance company is thinking ""How long until this idiot calls an obese patient a tub of lard and we have to fork out a hundred-thousand dollars to shut the patient up"".",1251565086

""I want people to feel my wrath and you are cracking jokes...""  It's a subtle show of disrespect of the social order.<p>It's also poignant because we've probably all been in situations where we were <i>compelled</i> to laugh at a joke that wasn't funny to show our allegiance to the joke teller.

793316,comment,792337,792547,0,0,olavk,,,"(1) Depends on how different the source language is from the semantics of JS. JS is a high-level language and doesn't have e.g. goto which would make it easy to implement different execution models. If you don't want to create your own interpreter in JS (which would be an alternative to code generation), you have to be manage with functions (and exceptions). If the source language require more powerful constructs like goto or continuations, you are out of luck. (Theoretically you could gain some power by compiling to a continuation-passing style, but since JS engines doesnt have TCO, I dont think this would work in reality.<p>The scoping rules combined with the distinction between expressions and statements means that it is harder to generate composable snippets. For example you cannot just generate a small ""context free"" code snippet with a local variable - the scope of a variable is always the function, so you need either to mangle the name to create a unique variable, or create an inline function and call it - but that changes the semantics of return, which again is a hindrance to composability.<p>I would definitely prefer something like scheme as a compilation target, but it could be a lot worse. Imagine compiling to VBScript :-)<p>For my particular project which compiles ES5/Harmony to JavaScript it works quite well, but those languages are based on JavaScript anyway, so that is almost cheating.<p>(2) AFAIK the working group are a aware of the interest in JS a compilation target, but are not at the time considering adding features specifically to make it more suitable for that purpose.",1251562690

Because if the country just thinks about ""rights,"" then the people with means can have what they want, while the people without want the meaning of have.<p>2. Why should my country not support an international court of justice?<p>A2. Everybody supports justice. Your country must believe that that court is not just justice.<p>3. Is my country not strong enough to achieve its aims fairly?<p>3A. If all agreed the aim was fair, then why the strength to achieve the aim?<p>4. When the leaders of a country cause it to do terrible things, what is the best way to restore the honor of that country?<p>4A. Collectively forget about the terrible things in that country.<p>5. Is it possible for potential new leaders to raise questions about their country's possible guilt, without committing political suicide?<p>5A. If committing political homicide, then yes.<p>6. Do I deserve retribution from aggrieved people whose lives have been ruined by actions that my leaders have taken without my consent?<p>6A. According to the aggrieved people: yes.<p>7. How can I best help set in motion a process by which reparations are made to people who have been harmed by unjust deeds of my country?<p>7A. Open a commercial franchise and employ those people.

If day after day goes by with nobody discussing uncomfortable questions like these, won't the good people of my country be guilty of making things worse?<p>8A. I don't know, because day after day everybody constantly discusses questions like these, yet they are good people and their country belongs to them.

Feel free to correct.)<p>One major difference between .NET thread pools and GCD is that the former are used in a high-level, garbage collected language, while the latter are built on top of C. Call me old fashioned, but if I'm CPU bound then I'm going to explore moving the bottlenecks to C first, and THEN look into parallelism if they still aren't fast enough. GCD follows that order, .NET has it backwards. (Although I hear the JIT is pretty good, and VS supports OpenMP which is nearly as good as GCD.)<p>There's an argument to do things the other way: stay in the high-level regime, make things parallel and buy more hardware, but this strategy is more prevalent (and useful) on the server, rather than the desktop, and in that case going to threads is just postponing the inevitable, you need to go fully distributed.<p>There will always be value in good, fast serial code, and nothing is going to beat C at that in the foreseeable future.",1251561989

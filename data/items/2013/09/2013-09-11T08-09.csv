6366181,comment,6365898,6365898,4,0,Sanddancer,,,"The M7 here is not a revolution by a long shot. Companies have been using this very technique -- a small, slow, low powered coprocessor -- for decades for these kinds of devices for the exact same purposes apple is. I&#x27;ve used the technique myself in certain hobby projects because, like apple, I don&#x27;t want to have my big beefy processor running all the time, nor stopping to poll a bunch of data I don&#x27;t want to care about right away. It&#x27;s just easier to gather it up with a slower, lower-powered device, and get the data when I actually do need to process it. The rest of what you&#x27;re describing in the article, again, has nothing to do with apple whatsoever, other than them being late to the dance.<p>Were apple really to want to revolutionize health and medicine, they&#x27;d need to start by bringing everyone to the table, and actually collaborate on an interface and open specification, so that the technology can get to the people who need it the most. Right now, Apple&#x27;s more concerned about giving toys to geeks than actually changing the world, and I don&#x27;t see that changing any time soon.",1378889892

6366176,comment,6365427,6366044,5,0,asgard1024,,,"> How can any government accept a situation where communications are so secure that none of their agencies can break it?<p>Does the government accept situation where it cannot read your own thoughts? How is that different?<p>You could make the same argument about crime fighting here. If we could read thoughts, well, then there would be no unsolvable crime really. But is it desirable?<p>So, no, even anarchists won&#x27;t agree (neither me, and I am not an anarchist). The privacy comes to moral consideration too. Secret communication has no effect on the real world unless the people communicating actually act. Just like thoughts have no effect on the real world, unless you act. That&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t punish thoughts, but acts, and by that extension, we shouldn&#x27;t punish communication, just acting based on that communication. Since these acts take place in the real world, criminal investigation is not obstructed.<p>Edit: Maybe a clarification. You could make an argument that if you don&#x27;t know communication between people, then it&#x27;s harder to convict a specific person rather than just the group. But the same is true for private communication (it was always a problem, even before electronic communications), and is also true for communication between neurons (we cannot be sure if person acted willingly or is a psychiatric case).",1378889699

This is pretty much <i>the</i> dividing line between anarchism and marxist socialism/communism (the marxist standpoint is that a large scale working class uprising would enable the transformation of the state from a tool of oppression by the upper classes against the working class to a temporary tool of oppression by the working class against the upper classes, becoming obsolete as the working class subsumes the previously privileged classes), and also one of the major distinguishing features between anarchism and the various form of liberalism (in the classical sense, not the modern US sense) and libertarianism<p>The point being that the government does not serve you. It may quite regularly do things that overlap with your interests, but your influence on your government is disproportionally small in any situation where economic power buys you more attention from legislators per head than a vote does.<p>In that kind of situation, something that makes the government afraid is not something we should forget, but something to embrace and expand to help redress the balance.<p>Yes, it also helps &#x27;the bad guys&#x27;. So does envelopes on your mail, the ability to freely lock your door and expect the police not to wander it at their leisure, or the ability to walk down the street without an id number stamped to your forehead. It would make things a lot easier for law enforcement if we all lived in prison already. Obviously we do not accept these things - it is not enough for something to benefit law enforcement for us to accept it.<p>> But to expect government to accept a situation where there is zero way they can snoop or investigate is asking a lot.<p>I see noone expecting government to accept such a situation, and even flawless information security for your communications does not create such a situation. You are setting up a strawman with this sentence.<p>> What is needed is a rock solid frame work and set of rules that properly limit how the snooping is done.<p>Rules don&#x27;t stop people from doing something when the ability to monitor that they are actually complying is nearly non-existent.<p>> I&#x27;d suggest it should be developed by an international group, UN backed, and made part of being a member.<p>This is a very naive view of how the UN works. The very point of the UN is that it is inclusive - you don&#x27;t exclude even the worst dictators because then you shut down communication. The upside is that this means there is a forum to make agreements amongst pretty much all the governments of the world. The downside is that you have to deal with these governments even when drafting agreements where &quot;the good guys&quot;, if you can even come up with a cohesive list of who they would be, all agree to principles that would substantially improve things. Yes, it is infuriating whenever some dictatorship effectively shuts down some initiative, but it is the reality we have to live in as long as these regimes exist.<p>In other words, the UN will not do something like this because it goes directly counter to the interests of the governments of a large number of UN countries. And without substantial political upheaval it also goes counter to the interests of the governments of many democratic countries whose populations might prefer much stricter rules.<p>> Or could it be something that has to be agreed to as part of acquiring IP addresses or domain names. Dunno, but tie it in some how.<p>The current system for allocation of IP addresses and domain names only works because everyone voluntarily defers to the respective authorities. Even then, nothing but technical skills stops you, your grandma, or your government from setting up its own DNS roots, and nothing stops your ISP or your government from changing routing tables and allocate its own addresses.<p>They don&#x27;t because it would break a lot of things, and because the current processes are sufficiently apolitical to not give them a reason to.  If that changed, the internet would break into islands where not all parts can talk to all other parts without intermediaries.<p>This is why nobody has force the issue of tieing non-technical requirements to allocations of IP addresses or domains any more than it is in anyones interest to, say, withhold a country code for phone numbers from a dictatorship.",1378888829

If they are interested in security research (or just breaking stuff) either as a learning experience or a challenge, then they might be doing these things anyway. Once something is found, what do you do with it? File it and enjoy the inner glow of pride perhaps, but if someone like Google publicly acknowledges your achievement it becomes a validated success that goes on your CV and/or gets talked about in an interview as a measure of your knowledge/skill. Even ignoring the CV/interview: in some circles it is worth it just for the bragging rights.<p>The money is a secondary issue IMO. For some it is encouragement to try again and potentially find something else useful to submit, for others it is an alternative to flogging the exploit for more on relevant forums (though without the right contacts I expect getting good money this way is not as easy as some suggest). For others it is just a happy little bonus, they&#x27;d keep going anyway and continue to submit their findings but they&#x27;re not daft enough to turn down a little cash if offered.<p>And of course the tertiary issue is that you are helping to improve the security (and/or reliability more generally) of a product that you yourself rely upon, and therefore want to see improved as far as is possible in terms of security and reliability.<p>The average pay-out is not a terribly good measure though: people aren&#x27;t aiming for the average and the payout for critical issues is much higher. There are quite a few awards for more minor issues which are easier to find (and sometimes are found by relatively effort free semi-automated methods) which skews the average making the effort of finding one of those critical issues look less rewarding that it actually could be.",1378888637

We also (especially in tech) are working to make the workplace more friendly to women than it has been in the past. We&#x27;re also a very litigious country, meaning that having an officer making those kinds of statements about protected classes while being involved in hiring/firing decisions exposes the company to risks that 95+% of executives would be wise/willing enough not to expose their employer to.<p>You may be right that most people have tweeted something that would outrage people, but if you want to be one of the faces of a company, part of your job is not doing that.

For the rest, they are only mutually hostile on the surface. I am sure when it suits them they will get together and sell all our asses to each other.",1378886429

All in the name of &quot;we wont be able to catch criminals if we cant listen in on communications&quot;. Up to that point in time, encryption and secure communications was reserved for agencies and those in power, it was not for the plebians. See for example how it went for PGP.<p>I guess a route that US agencies took is to &quot;we will recommend good standards for you, because you know we also need security, but you shouldnt know all those standards and implementations will be compromised so we still retain the ability to spy on you while you wont be able to spy on us and if you do then you&#x27;re a traitor&quot;.",1378886408

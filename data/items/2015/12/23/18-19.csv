It would be incredibly easy for the IRS to just say when you execute an option that stock will always be treated as regular income and can never get benefit of capital gains tax no matter how long you hold it before selling. There are obviously many drawbacks to this but at least you cant get screwed paying taxes on money you never earn. This will never happen because the people lobbying for the current tax codes are not the people getting hurt by these ridiculous AMT rules. AMT was created to prevent people like steve jobs from collecting their entire salary in the form of options and not paying any taxes but the people most effected are clearly not rich CEOs like steve jobs<p>If i buy a plot of land work hard to build a house on that land i dont have to pay tax on the increased value of the property until i sell it yet if i work at a company and buy options as it grows i am taxed immediately before i can realize a gain",1450897113

10784927,comment,10782443,10782443,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Just as a matter context, Piotr Wozniak is the author of SuperMemo, the first significant spaced repetition software (SRS) application.  The SuperMemo2 (usually referred to as SM2), devised by Piotr, is used in most SRS software including Anki (arguably the most popular free software SRS app).  My understanding is that Piotr obtained a PhD for his work on these algorithms.  SuperMemo was a commercial enterprise, but I seem to remember there was some falling out with the business side of things and Piotr left (though I haven&#x27;t really followed supermemo for a decade and things may have changed).<p>Piotr has some interesting ideas.  His writings tend to be very much like this article -- bury you in details, some of which you wonder about the relevance.  He is a fairly intuitive in his approach and is very much convinced about the conclusions he reaches.  He always has a large amount of data to support his conclusions, but a criticism I&#x27;ve had in the past is that the data is not always free of bias.<p>I only mention this as there was some suggestion that the submission was a disguised ad.  Even though I don&#x27;t agree with everything that Piotr writes, one can&#x27;t deny that his ideas have helped a lot of people.  He has always been very generous with his ideas and his data.  His business partner was not quite so generous and I believe this was one of the reasons for the fallout.  Whatever you think about the content of this article, my personal feeling is that you can be sure that it was written with the intent of helping people better themselves and no other motives.",1450897107

Start ups have license to pursue ideas that established companies simply cannot.<p>2) <i>It will improve your skill set</i> - There is only so much you can learn at school or online, some skills have to be practiced to be learned. Start ups can give you a role you want, even if your resume isn&#x27;t a match. Which will get you over the chicken and egg problem of you don&#x27;t have experience in the job you want to do to be hired in the job you want to do. That can get you into a job elsewhere where the &quot;entry level&quot; position requires previous experience.<p>3) <i>You will work with someone you respect</i> - Start ups are small, visible, and stressful. Ask anyone to name 10 people they worked with a BigCo and 10 people they worked with at a startup, the latter is much easier. Stress, higher highs, lower lows, creates stronger bonds. Those friendships will follow you through out your life, they will help when you&#x27;re looking for advice or a job, and support when you are trying to pull off something really hard to do.<p>If you choose to join a startup for one of those three reasons it will <i>always</i> deliver.",1450897022

I&#x27;ve worked for people who talked a big collaboration/flat structure game, but when it comes down to important projects, all of the sudden, one guy is the decider, and he is only giving responsibility to his lieutenants, who have direct command over the people below. He can count on his hand the number of people who have true control over real resources, which makes it easy for him to reason about where costs are going.<p>Everyone tries to be nice about it, but my sense is that almost no one actually believes in giving serious responsibilities to a wide range of people. They have their go-to people, and everyone else has to prove themselves by following directions well and maybe they can get a position in that structure at some theoretical later date.<p>I haven&#x27;t worked in very many different companies though, so I would love to hear if that&#x27;s actually becoming a bigger thing in other places.

My city just built a new bridge over our river, and the engineers who signed off on its design and construction were doing so under a certain legal framework that is designed to ensure that the design was done using proper methodologies, appropriate tests were conducted, etc. If the bridge fails due to shoddy design, those engineers will personally face certain professional and legal consequences. That same legal and regulatory framework gives the engineers certain protections should management try and make them cut corners on the design or testing (in theory, anyway).<p>People have been debating for years about whether there ought to be a similar legal framework for software engineering. There are plenty of good arguments on both sides of that discussion, IMHO, but the sorts of situation described by the original article would fall squarely under the &quot;pro&quot; side of the equation. I can easily envision a world in which, for software that is critical to a public safety function of government, states had to buy software written by bonded and licensed engineers. Presumably, under such a framework, a licensed software engineering company would have to have a system in place such that their &quot;hit by a bus factor&quot; would be >1- i.e., they&#x27;d need to have sufficient documentation or process in place to enable any single engineer to go on extended leave without preventing critical bug-fixes from taking place.<p>This is obviously something that any developer would recognize as a &quot;best practice&quot;, but that in practice is often infeasible due to organizational constraints. The advantage to a system of regulation and licensure would (in theory) be that it would empower engineers to demand such practices be in place in their organizations, and would incentivize companies to set themselves up to enable such practices. In theory. As the saying goes, &quot;in theory, there&#x27;s no difference between theory and practice.&quot; Hence why this has been an ongoing debate in the software world for decades.",1450896220

The reason I&#x27;ve LEARNED to worry about that is because sometimes I thought people were being nice but they were being sarcastic to me and making fun of me to me or in front of their friends.<p>Sometimes, hours later, I&#x27;ll have to reobserve the interaction in my head, view it from all possible angles, cross check it against how this person typically is/how much I genuinely think they like me or not, and then I can feel pretty confident in about the message I think they were really sending across. But if I don&#x27;t have alot of previous experiences with this person to cross check, it&#x27;s like having an incomplete algorithm to make a decision on.<p>Yes, this is an arduous process and it&#x27;s why alot of people tend to say I keep them at a distance for a while before I get to know them, I need to stay safe and then gradually as I learn more about them open up to them because I can interpret how they are reacting to me correctly.<p>When it comes to having mutual crushes. It&#x27;s turning out to be a nightmare trying to navigate weather a guy is genuinely into me and even if I&#x27;m willing to believe he is how to engage with that, when other girls are masterminds of cutsey mindgames and being flirtacious.<p>The guy I think is into me right now I think has become frustrated because I&#x27;m not flirting back with him, but he knows I like being around him, so it&#x27;s confusing for him and I think hes getting frustrated thinking I&#x27;m playing mind games. I need to go talk to him before he goes away entirely but what to say? Gosh I don&#x27;t know, been debating that for weeks now...<p>In summary, can not only be exhausting it can be emotionally painful and hurtful when the people on the other side facing you don&#x27;t really understand what it&#x27;s like in your head. They tend to jump to alot of conclusions that are not even close to the innocent confusion I experience and genuine effort I&#x27;m putting in to get to know them.",1450895308

The very first admin of that company got so rich from stock options that she bought a vineyard and retired in 1999.  Lots of people bought houses with the money they made, including the first engineer who bought a house in prime PA.<p>I joined another startup just a few years ago, and they were extremely stingy with options.  &quot;Less-important&quot; people (ie. anyone non-engineers, or non-management) were getting a few hundred or maybe a few thousand options, which I thought was a bummer.  I think everyone contributes to the success of the company, and everyone should get a chance to do well if the company does well.  But I&#x27;ve seen this case several times where the founders keep everything for themselves.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what changed, but it&#x27;s probably reflective of how greedy and self-centered SV is getting.

If you know your ownership percentage (and every startup employee should), you can then do the math to figure out how big an exit the company would need to have the desired financial outcome, eg. if you own 0.01% of the company, it would need to exit for $10.6B before you become a millionaire.

Among them, who makes <i>and judges</i> the law is crucial. From A.H.M. Jones biograpy <i>Augustus</i>, a description of 1st centure B.C.E. Rome&#x27;s two primary political parties -- a plutonomic obligates, the proletarian populares, and the swing-voting equites, and the fundamental platforms:  strong property rights and absolute honoring of debt by the obligates, land reform (democratising the means of production) and grain subsidies (one way to accomplishing what a living wage would provide), and the interests of each in either securing more power for themselves, or of weakening the power of the opposition. Oh, and complete with extrajudicial executions of the unfortunate. It all sound stunningly contemporary. Frighteningly so.<p><quote><p>[Gracchus&#x27;s land distribution bill of 133 B.C.] was the first in a series of violent clashes between two groups who called themselves the optimates and the populares. The nucleus of the optimates was the small clique of nobles … who more or less monopolized the highest offices and dominated the Senate, but they had wide support among the propertied class, even, as Cicero says, propserous freedman; otherwise they could not have maintained their unbroken hold on the higher magistracies. They were conservatives, who regarded the rights of property as sacred, and therefore resisted bitterly any attempts to redistribute land or cancel debt. They were upholders of the constitution and of religion, which could be used to block any revolutionary legislation. Though at times they had to yield to popular pressure, they always remained the government.<p>The populares were a much less well defined group. Their leaders were individual politicians or very small groups of politicians, who at intervals attempted to legislate in the interests of the people, by which they meant the common people.… The populares developed a regular programme of legislation:<p>First came the distribution of smallholdings to landless citizens.…<p>The next … was the provision by the state of corn for the proletariat of Rome at a price that they could afford.<p>From time to time the populares were interested in the problem of debt, which frequently meant agricultural indebtedness.<p>They were early successful in introducing the secret ballot into voting in the assembly, for legislation, elections and trials.<p>They also stood up against the execution of Roman citizens without a lawful trial; the Senate was very prone to ignore this elementary right of the citizen in what it deemed to be political crises.<p>Most populares advocated the grant of citizenship to the Italian allies. They were generally interested in the welfare of the provincials; most of the extortion laws were promoted by populares.<p>Finally, they substituted equites (citizens owning 400,000 sesterces who were not senators) for senators as jurors in the criminal courts.<p></quote><p>Compare these with the various demands of the American and French revolutions, the British Chartists, and the revolutions of 1848 (Wikipedia will give you a good overview of each).<p>Title: Augustus.\nAuthor: A.

Properly factoring in liquidation preferences and your 409a valuation of <i>common</i> stock would not have ever hit $4.29 per share with 229 million shares outstanding. The fact that preferred shares sold for that price is completely irrelevant, it&#x27;s like saying the Tesla sells for $80k so we&#x27;ll just value this Nissan Leaf the same.<p>The IRS does not force these companies to improperly value the common stock. It&#x27;s just the default position they take because it&#x27;s cheaper for the company this way.<p>The 409a valuation is based on the price someone would pay for 100% of the outstanding shares of converted-to-common shares. This is much lower than preferred stock investment price (where the dollars are being put into the company to grow it, not being paid to shareholders to retire). It&#x27;s even much lower than the secondary market price since that&#x27;s the price for a small percentage of shares -- try selling them all and the bid/ask would fall to zero.<p>The price of illiquid common stock must reflect the risk-taking stance of management and the Board. Even having an $800m offer doesn&#x27;t have to boost the common stock valuation so much because if management is declining those offers and swinging for the fences you can reasonably factor in that risk in the price.<p>Unless and until an actual IPO, companies should take a discounted future cash flow model based on single-digit future growth to demonstrate the common stock value is absolutely worthless, and everyone should be required to file 83(b).<p>We know its a lottery ticket, the tax code allows us to value it appropriately.

I don&#x27;t see any issue, aside from Clinton&#x27;s wish-washyness and clear ignorance on this subject.<p>She understands that &quot;Apple and Tech Experts&quot; are angry about this issue, but she clearly doesn&#x27;t understand why.<p><a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/democratic-debate-transcript-clinton-sanders-omalley-in-new-hampshire/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/democratic-debate-transcript-cli...</a><p>> CLINTON: I would not want to go to that point. I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they&#x27;re not adversaries, they&#x27;ve got to be partners.<p>> It doesn&#x27;t do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after. There must be some way. I don&#x27;t know enough about the technology,Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.<p>> And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that. But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can&#x27;t know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.<p>> CLINTON: I just think there&#x27;s got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out. Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.<p>> So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe. And that&#x27;s what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.<p>----------<p>I would like it for my politicians to understand technical issues, alas I&#x27;ve resigned myself to the fact that politicians really don&#x27;t know what they are talking about. And all Clinton has done here is prove once more, that she doesn&#x27;t know what she&#x27;s talking about.<p>Anyone who knows this issue (ie: You and Me) both know that there <i></i>is a direct contradiction<i></i> in Clinton&#x27;s speech here. She&#x27;s either playing dumb, or is dumb about this issue.<p>And the rest of the reporters (Vice, Intercept, etc. etc.) are going crazy as if this is some existential threat on the internet. No, in my opinion, this is simply another presidential candidate trying to be vague about an issue they don&#x27;t fully understand.",1450893707

So, if my layman understanding is correct, you get an offer to pay a discounted price on company stock whenever you want (usually based somewhat on valuation when you&#x27;re hired). Then, the company&#x27;s valuation increases (all on paper and in private, not public market price corrections, just whatever investors think is &quot;fair&quot;), and you exercise your stock option. The difference between the price you paid (your option price) and the value of the share (as determined by the private valuation) is now taxable income in the eyes of the IRS. You will owe taxes on stocks that might still end up being worthless, and your employer also has the power to prevent you from selling them before they go public/are bought out.",1450893689

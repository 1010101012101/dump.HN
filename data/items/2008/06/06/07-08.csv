I'm not even talking about purely bot-generated spam - I mean, I just submitted that ""Ghandi Christ"" (email abcd@efg.hij) will not be coming to the following event:<p><a href=""http://mobaganda.com/rev2party"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobaganda.com/rev2party</a><p>Which I found on google.<p>I don't really know/see how you can fix this problem. As I noted, captchas won't work.<p>On a completely unrelated note, I also really long for search and the ability to make an event ""searchable/unsearchable"".<p>---<p>THAT BEING SAID, I think this is a really wonderful idea. If you can get it to ""work"" without sacrificing any simplicity I will definitely be using this.<p>Anyway, these are some random guy's first impressions. Good luck, yo!",1212738943

(cheap compared to any other way of getting hold of a Cell) Unfortunately, having only 256 megs of system RAM severely limits its usefulness in my opinion.<p>I googled around a little, and it looks like VRAM (there's another 256MB of that) is exposed as a block device, so that could conceivably be used as lightning-fast swap space. (given a suitable priority boost over the hard disk swap) If the VRAM can be accessed directly via physical memory address mapping, then it could even be used directly, given some kernel hacking, maybe using some of the NUMA API.<p>Well, once I come up with an excuse for needing a Cell, I'll go through with it. ;)",1212738681

210684,comment,210185,210234,0,0,jeroen,,,"Like this:<p>""... NetDocs, a promising effort to offer software programs such as word processing over the Internet. The issue: Because NetDocs risked cannibalizing sales of Microsoft's cash-cow Office programs, some executives wanted NetDocs killed. ... First, NetDocs ballooned to a 400-person staff, then it got folded into the Office group in early 2001, where it died.""<p>The earliest mention of NetDocs I found was from 2000, 6 years before Google Docs was released. I imagine the tech execs would have supported the innovation and made MS a leader, but the management execs only thought about protecting their cashcow, which leaves MS trying to catch up with Google.",1212738531

He's the expert on such things.  Even if he takes himself out of the judging pool, the company already has his endorsement.\nSo the next question would be why would he even want to have them in the contest.\nOn one of the feeds he told a company founder to launch now rather than at TechCrunch 50 and he would cover the launch.<p>So is it better to launch inside or outside of the big show.  The reader seemed to think at the big show, replying we are going to add more features and apply for the conference.<p>So based on the Crowd:\nHe believes it is better for him to cover the launch of a company on his site.\nI think everyone else would rather have their run at the big show.\n.:Based on this he should cover the launch on his site as opposed to having them join the big show.<p>First, He is happy because be believes he did the best for his investment.\nSecond, the crowd seems to think TechCrunch 50 is more important, so we wouldn't feel any undue resentment.<p>How he handles this will affect who seeks out TechCrunch 50 for their launch next year.",1212737688

210671,comment,210427,210427,0,0,collin,,,"I have one question about Fuzed. (Turned out to be a few questions, oops.)<p>What happens when a Master node dies? (Or, say it's EC2 instance kicks the bucket, rare but possible. Or in the case of a non-EC2 deployment the hardware just fails.)<p>My limited understanding of Erlang leads me to think the unhandled death of a Master node is the death of all the nodes in the cluster.<p>Further, I understand this does not have to be. I remember there being some way for another node to respond to the death of another node, handle that death, and let things continue along.<p>Is anything like this set up in Fuzed? Would this be handled by having multiple master nodes for a cluster, and they watch each other?<p>Would there be any difference in setting up Fuzed to handle the death of the Master node process and the disappearance of the Master node instance?",1212737599

210669,comment,210595,210595,0,0,thwarted,,,"""Programmers do not respect authority, only ability.""<p>A minor mischaracterization.  Programmers respect authority that is derived from ability and historic record of ability to execute/produce.  Authority is something you earn and must maintain.  For many people, ""authority"" is merely asserted by someone in a position of power, with little to back it up other than their own claims of control.",1212737468

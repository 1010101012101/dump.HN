You have two possible situations:<p>1) The list contains only items of one type - in this case you already know what the type of all objects in the list is - it's a list of widgets, so all items are of type Widget.  Whilst queue.h will give you a compiler warning if ever you try to put a File into your widget list, is that every really likely to happen in real life???<p>2) You have a list of mixed-type objects.  In that case you need code to identify at runtime what the type of the object was anyhow, so type safety gets you nothing in that case either.<p>So, considering how little you get back for the decidely annoying problems of macros and polluted data structures, I really have no hesitation in counselling the avoidance of queue.h.<p>In answer to your question, no, I don't have a nice <i>typesafe</i> library.

The horror stories (such as Gawker's password compromise) don't help matters either.<p>The requirements of SHA1 Pass are:<p>0. Focus on sentence based passwords only (not long, complex passwords that no one can remember).<p>1. Generate passwords (do not store them). Nothing to safeguard or to backup in case of failure, corruption, or loss. All the end-users have to do is remember sentences.<p>2. Password generation must occur <i>locally</i> on end-use devices (not in web browsers and not in the cloud on some other company's server). Sorry, I just don't trust that.<p>3. SHA1 Pass must be portable and reproducible so others can implement the idea in the absence of SHA1 Pass or even perfect the idea. OpenSSL, crypto++, sha1sum and various other programming libraries and apps do SHA1. There is no secret/closed encryption.<p>I've been using SHA1 Pass for quite a while now, but I wanted to polish it up a bit and really start using it (especially after the gawker compromise) and share the application with Hacker News.<p>I realize that there is already excellent password management software available that has solid reputation and many features.

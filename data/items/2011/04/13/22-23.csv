Was it a specific revenue goal, a more polished plan of action, a certain user-growth model, or all of the above?  My limited experience from working at a consumer internet startup has taught me that once you hit about a million users, everything else seems to fall into place a lot easier. Of course that varies widely depending on the business, so I'm just interested in hearing other data points.",1302735582

That's the same as if you never share any resource in any shared global heap between threads.<p>The point is that Erlang's concurrency model allows the programmer to never make that mistake, because you're storing immutable resources not references to mutable data. See my longer post on the subject, further down the page. :)<p><i>OT: if performance comes into picture, one can claim excessive copying of immutable objects cause performance problem as well.</i><p>When you have a share-nothing immutable-data concurrency model like Erlang's, heap type is an implementation detail (and you'd probably choose it based on your performance requirements, as you've alluded to.) To wit, as TFA says, you can run the Erlang VM with either a shared heap or a separate heap model. Language semantics stay the same.",1302735500

According to data in ""The Tipping Point"", the average/typical human mind can follow the interactions of about 150 people in a group setting.  In my experience, the above combined stats results in a community of up to around 750 members will result in around 150 active members and works just fine.  Above that and things begin breaking down socially.  As far as I know, the only solution humans have come up with so far to counteract/cope with communities larger than 150 is formality of social interaction.  I think the transition from warm cozy community of about 150 active members to the need for something more formal to keep coping as it gets bigger is the growing pain that most communities seem to trip over the worst.<p>Maybe you can incorporate some of that info into your thinking.<p>Peace.",1302735337

Waiting for clients to call back. Waiting for bugs to get fixed. Waiting for features to be completed.

The big power law brands driven by customer appreciation are in media -- people love Lady Gaga (say), so she sells gazillions. Nobody loves yellowtail or sutter home. Many people love Screaming Eagle or Chateau Lafite. However, wine is an agricultural product; you cannot produce more bottles of a great wine than you can grow in some very particular fields in a year. The way scary hit-driven industries work is that you sell things way above marginal cost to everyone who wants them; in wine, since there's actually scarcity, very few people who love a brand can get as much as they want of it, so the prices at the top are insane (recent vintage screaming eagle is indicated at $2-3k per bottle), but the brands are smaller.<p>I'd guess the way to think of it is like the music industry before recording devices or electricity -- sure there are stars, but because supplies are limited nobody can by a megastar.",1302734966

2444557,comment,2442274,2442730,9,0,econner,,,"I would agree with this too.  I am an undergraduate CS student at Stanford and a section leader for the introductory courses (cs106b -- Prof Roberts calls it CS2 in the post -- this quarter).  I do notice quite a few kids who have consciously chosen to major in CS because it will help them with management if they want to get involved with startups and acknowledge that they don't want to code.<p>There are a number of other reasons I would argue though for the skyrocketing enrollment in CS here:<p>First, the financial meltdown has prompted a lot of kids that would have majored in things like economics or management science to get into CS.<p>Second, the introductory CS classes are widely considered some of the best classes here.  The CS department has taken the time to hire a group of phenomenal lecturers who love what they do and who spent an incredible amount of time crafting these classes.<p>Third, the introductory classes offer a level of human-to-human support that is unprecedented in any other department.  We use undergraduate TA's (like myself) for the intro classes.  We are a lot cheaper and so there are a lot more of us than there could be graduate TA's.  For example, the computer LaIR is staffed with TA's from 6pm - midnight Sunday through Thursday.<p>Fourth, the CS department dropped the CS140 requirement (hardcore operating systems -- the ""dump your girlfriend/boyfriend before you take this class because you won't be together after"" class) in favor of two more gentler systems courses.  This was mostly the result of the widening breadth of subject matter in CS and requirements that the department felt did not keep up with the offerings.<p>Fifth, CS itself has become an incredibly diverse subject.  Here there are seven concentrations within the major: artificial intelligence, theory, graphics, information, systems, biocomputation, and human-computer interaction.  There is a lot of overlap between them, but those overlaps also allow students to reach into other departments to get CS credit that they wouldn't have gotten within the department (e.g. art classes, physics, bio, etc).  One of my friends who is concentrating in HCI is taking all studio art this quarter.<p>Sixth, and perhaps most importantly, computing is becoming the platform on which a lot of other disciplines are built.  It is becoming a fundamental tool, in my opinion.  Look at computational linguistics and bioinformatics.  Even writing papers now comes down to understanding computers... I mean, after programming a lot, you get pretty darn good at Googling, a nontrivial skill I would argue.<p>Ok, maybe this should have been posted as a general comment, but I'll leave it here for contextual reasons.",1302734543

Why not refuse to render images, or videos, or use any sort of plugin?</i><p>Yes, I normally block videos and all plugins. I don't have to block images by default any more, thankfully the obnoxious animated ones have mostly moved to Flash.<p>Occasionally I'll switch browsers and permit specific youtube videos.<p><i>For that matter, why not use Lynx?</i><p>My recollection is that Lynx does not support proportionally-spaced fonts or images. If this is incorrect, I'll consider using it.<p>In fact, I do know someone who uses exclusively text-based browsers. She's doing research on accessibility issues for the visually impaired.<p><i>I really do not understand the sort of Luddite motivations that drive someone to disable Javascript.</i><p>Maybe if you didn't presume it to be a Luddite motivation, you'd have a chance at understanding it.<p><i>You're drawing an arbitrary line in the sand that cuts you off from a great deal of perfectly legitimate functionality. Could you explain exactly what you're gaining in return?</i><p>Well I will enable script for specific sites that I want to do business with. But it's done intentionally and limited in scope. If the site requires scripts from a bunch of shady domains and ad networks, I'm much less likely to do business with them.<p>By aggressively disabling Javascript and not installing Flash I gain:<p>1. Security: Less attack surface, less frequent patching, less risk of getting pwned by drive-by malware. Fewer trusted domains in my page origin.<p>2. Privacy: A lot of advertiser tracking stuff depends on script running in your browser. Declining to run their script seems to cut down significantly on the amount of personally-identifiable info you're constantly broadcasting as you use the web.<p>3. Faster page loading.<p>4. Fewer advertisements, pop-overs, and other useless blinking crap in my visual field detracting from the words and occasional image on the page which convey 99% of the meaning.<p>5. By avoiding proprietary plug-ins I follow open standard (w3c, IETF) technologies. These are consistently winners in the long run.<p>6. I learn a little about the mindset of the developer of the site. Take a look at who's running script in your browser in news.ycombinator.com and compare that to any of the Gawker media sites for example.<p><i>Isn't this just another incarnation of 1990s-era cookie paranoia?</i><p>Similar in some ways, different in others. Cookies have some very similar security properties to that of scripts WRT same-origin.<p><i>It seems to me that if you use an up-to-date browser and an ounce of common sense when you surf the Web, you have little to fear from Javascript. And if you don't, no technological measures short of total disconnection will save you from yourself.</i><p>That's the ""all or nothing, it's hopeless, give up"" argument and yeah most people <i>are</i> willing to give up their security and privacy when you throw that in their face.<p>But not me.

2444482,comment,2440364,2443280,1,0,dkarl,,,"Obviously not -- recursion isn't limited to computing.  However, nested meanings is inherent in recursive definitions because recursion means defining something in terms of itself.  If you come up with a recursive idea that happens to be amenable to tail-call optimization, then you will be able to forget about the nesting, but that only happens through work or luck.  <i>Forgetting about the nesting is an implementation hack.</i>  Consider the classic example of the Von Neumann ordinals:<p><pre><code>    0 = {}\n    n + 1 = n  {n}\n\n    3 = 2  {2} = 1  {1}  {1  {1}} etc.\n</code></pre>\nOr even consider the most natural definition of the factorial function, which is not tail-recursive either:<p><pre><code>    f(1) = 1\n    f(n+1) = (n+1) * f(n)\n</code></pre>\nAs the factorial function illustrates, the most natural recursive definition is often not tail-recursive.  If you're trying to turn a recursive function into a form that can be efficiently executed as a computer program, you often have to transform the function into a form that is amenable to tail-call optimization.  That's something that only programmers care about, though.  Or, perhaps, programmers and babies.<p>If you believe that people naturally conceive of recursive ideas, then what happens when their ideas aren't easily transformed to a tail-recursive form?  Is that why babies cry all the time?  Perhaps by the time we are small children we have learned to subconsciously discard all recursive ideas that we can't transform into a tail-recursive form?  If there is a part of my brain that naturally generates tail-recursive solutions to problems but won't plague me with frustrating non-tail-recursive solutions, I would love to tap into it.",1302733062

I took literature and art classes when possible, but due to my demanding CS program I did not get to explore nearly what I wanted to.<p>Furthermore, I found myself surrounded by engineers who rarely shared my interest. In spite of this I continued moonlighting my obsessions and have grown a library of 7 full shelfs (excluding school books, library checkouts, and kindle downloads) and cases of art supplies.<p>It's common with programmers to look down on wannabe artists that do not adhere to strict logic in creation or conversations. (Just try asking an artist what they were trying to achieve with their piece. Your answer will be a glare of pity mixed with disgust. I often find, thought not always, this is a diversion tactic because the concept is to ""fuzzy"" to convince anyone of it).<p>But when you strip Great Art to its pure essence you will discover a philosophical theory that adheres to a form of logic. We are not completely in the wrong to view this with skepticism since many pseudo-artists can not see this, let alone create it themselves; their only option is to fake it and hope their bravado convinces other. With programming we have no such luxury, if you are incompetent no level of bullshit will make your design work.<p>This leads me to my current situation where I am trying to find a way to integrate my love of programming with my innate drive to explore beyond the limitations imposed by my code. For now this means waking at 5am, writing for 3-4 hours, going to work until 7, writing a few more hours, then sleep.<p>Believe it or not, this regiment actually makes me a better programmer. I find myself not only more relaxed during the day, but often am able to rethink my solution and identify flaws instead of powering into the code as I once did.<p>I am not sure this helped, but my main message was that learning to think about things in a different way gives you a versatility that manifests in ways you may not anticipate.

I think Google did a very good job with this, since the ads it serves you are more likely to be genuinely helpful to what you are trying to do.

The result isn't even much less efficient: the variable is not going to be that much smaller than the value itself pasted in.<p>When you combine the want to support popular older browsers, the fact that not everyone will implement it at all, and the assured compatibility issues between implementations, we will just be running the preprocessor anyway and using it for every browser (again: as there is almost no benefit to using the native implementation). By the time we aren't, there will be some other feature we really want the preprocessor for.<p>However, being able to have variables in media queries does provide drastically different capabilities as a compile target for our preprocessors. To simulate having variables in media queries requires preprocessors to fork entire rules with each of the different possible media query expansions for the variable. This is an actual (albeit not gigantic) benefit that will allow users to download smaller CSS files if the server detects they can handle it.<p>Therefore, I would look at this more like a CPU that added a new instruction that cannot be implemented as a macro-expansion in an assembler, but for compilers of high-level languages that are capable of detecting support for it, allows much faster or smaller execution when available.",1339613757

Compared to this really turgid article by the same author, the essay is really engrossing. Incidentally, I just finished reading it a few days ago on a privacy paper binge, and I also recommend<p><i>Broken Promises of Privacy: Responding to the Surprising Failure of Anonymization</i>: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=1450006"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=1450006</a><p>which is an even better paper, although it clocks in at 77 pages. Also free.<p>Some fun findings:<p>1. The combination of ZIP code, birth date (including year), and sex is unique to 87 per cent of Americans. Cross-reference this with voter data, and you're busted.<p>2. The information of how and when you rated any three movies on Netflix can identify more than 80 per cent of its users (68% for two movies). Cross-reference this with IMDb database, and you're busted.<p>It's scary as hell to learn that privacy is an even harder problem to solve, as someone who cares deeply about it. The key take-away from the latter paper is that privacy and utility are mutually exclusive - you can't ""anonymize"" data. The second is that we have to rethink our concept of personal identifiable information, because <i>everything</i> can be used to whittle down the candidates to a unique person with the right information.<p>We are so far from implementing useful privacy measures legally and practically that it's ridiculous. We are being embarrassingly myopic by only turning our attention to social networks, when there are privacy vulnerabilities everywhere.<p>Unless it's biometric data that we can relate to our own body - retina, fingerprint, facial features, DNA, etc. - , there is some psychological mechanism that makes us less averse and sensitive to the collection of data about us. Compare how you feel about the police storing DNA and fingerprints of acquitted suspects to how the NSA is trying to basically data-mine the entire communication infrastructure. That is, when careless companies or witless users don't just hand the information to them directly.<p>For people who care as much as privacy, as people in technology circles do, we have a really bad habit of focusing our attention narrowly at mainly what Silicon Valley does. But consider the value of something as simple as your zip code, birth date, and sex, and how many sites you might hand out that information to - the last information of which can usually be inferred by the service or commodity you buy, or your name.",1339613383

Either you aren't that interested or you hit a knowledge roadblock.<p>The knowledge roadblock is probably the easier of the two to overcome. Join a local users group. My learning was highly stunted until I had people around me that could answer my (frequently dumb) questions face to face.

And a whole bunch of regulation to prevent people from gaming the system. Unfortunately that would hurt the internet.<p>Your idea isn't practical and not the way a free market works. There is nothing special about domains that requires such special protection. They aren't kidneys or liver transplants. Lastly, there are other TLD that you can register your name in.

If you can't get hackernews.com you can get hackernews.tld<p>I was around at the start when a) domains were free b) domains were then priced at $100 for 2 years and c) that price was lowered to $70 for 2 years. Then came ICANN and many registrars and domains dropped to $10 or whatever godaddy was charging at the time or Tucows etc.<p>I was around in the beginning when you had to fill out a long form and say what you were doing with the name. Pretty soon there were so many people wanting domains that NSI asked the NSF if they could charge per name. Then people got upset with the money they were making and we got competition.

Seeing that the 2 year mark will be upon it and it's still supported by Mountain Lion. I have a late '07 Mac Pro that is not supported.<p>I'm sort of in the middle of this. On one hand, I'd love to keep using my Pro because it still works fine (and I'm one of those types that get's pissed when the machine is slow). I've had to upgrade to ssd, put an ATI 4870 in it, filled it with 16GB ram, still has stock 2x2 3ghz Xeon's. But this has been my main development machine for years and has made me a good amount of money over the years, so I see the upgrades and very reasonable. I still think I could run Mountain Lion fine, but there's the whole 32-bit EFI thing that Apple has handcuffed it with. So this is the downside for me.<p>On the other hand, I'm not against modernizing everything. I think that Apple does not have to support years of legacy hardware like Microsoft does is a good thing. We can always be assured of the latest and greatest. If I could get min 2-4 years out of a laptop, that would be good for me.<p>As for Apple locking everything down? I see why they do it - it's all about design. Why include a thicker ram slot(s) when you can just solder it on the board and reduce your profile, or give you better space. We're going to see more and more custom from them, trending away from using off the shelf parts that everyone else will have to use. This will give them a competitive differentiator, which it already does with their unibody laptops.<p>However, the obvious downside (mostly for geeks/power users) is that we can't buy the 8gb ram option now for less, and then upgrade later. So we're forced into that decision quandary of buy for less now with not what we really want, or pay through the nose up front, grumble a bit, then go on our merry way.

So:<p>(a) The RAM capacity is limited by the chipset anyway, and on ""pro"" machines, most people max out the RAM when they purchase or directly after.  It's just that now you can't cheat and buy the RAM elsewhere to avoid an apple price premium.<p>(b) The SSD <i>is</i> replaceable, it's just not a standard connector.  Obviously, 3rd party replacements will show up with a slightly higher cost than a bog standard SATA drive.  I view this like the replacement of FW with tbolt, who cares?<p>(c) (Stock) RAM seldom goes bad before other components, and if it does, you treat it like the other components.  They can unplug the SSD from your MBP and plug it into an identical one, swap complete.  So we're not talking weeks for a replacement here -- just go to an Apple store. If you're not near an Apple store, you're probably not near a vendor of replacement RAM or SSD drives either.<p>One issue though:  You had better keep that SSD backed up!  'cause if the machine goes south, you have no way of accessing your data unless someone comes out with a apple propretary card egd to sata adapter.",1339612389

You're seriously claiming that someone who can intelligently navigate the rats nest that is the J2SE library environment can't handle autotools (and for the record: autotools really isn't what I'm talking about)?  Please.  It's just laziness and aesthetics.  One looks shiny and new, and the other crufty and old.

That was <i>sarcasm</i>, intended to show the limit that IDE users hit trying to extend their tools.  For a practical example, how about this: conditionally build the modules of your C/C++ project such that they can be either linked in statically to the main binary or loaded dynamically, and generate both versions in a standard build.  Someone who knows how the linker works and how to write a makefile can do this in a day, easily.  Someone who only knows the IDE will be lost; there's no button for that.

For a variety of reasons, I have put that on the shelf, and as my savings is nearly gone, I have been pursuing freelance work to try to stay afloat while I figure things out.<p>And that is where this story begins.  I completed a 3-week freelance job, sent the invoice, and was told by the consultant that they pay via Dwolla, so I should setup an account there and he would send my payment.  I did this.  The initial portion of the setup process was fairly simple, fill in a few fields, and you're setup.  The only field that caused me to hesitate was SSN, but I decided to proceed.  After that, I started the process of linking up a bank account, which takes about 2 days as they ACH a few cents to your account and have you verify.  So far, so good, I can see it's going to take longer to get my money than I'd hoped, but nothing too concerning yet.<p>After my account was setup, and bank account verified, I let the consultant know the ID to send payment to.  A day later, I received notice that the payment had been sent.  After spending some time trying to transfer that payment to my bank account, I finally found that the payment takes a full week to clear and be available in my Dwolla account.  OK, I figured, things move pretty slow at Dwolla, so I'd better stay on top of it and make the transfer to my bank account the instant the funds clear.<p>A week later, yesterday morning, I received notification that the payment had finally cleared, and was available in my Dwolla account.  I logged in, and initiated the transfer of the funds to my previously verified bank account.  They claimed that it would take another 3-5 business days to complete that transfer.  This is where the trouble started.<p>A few hours later, I received an email from Dwolla stating that I must verify my account by uploading a scanned image of my driver's license or passport, before any action can continue on my withdrawal of funds.  I'm sorry, I don't want to give an electronic copy of my driver's license to some startup with millions of dollars in lawsuits already pending against it.  Why did they not ask for this during my account setup or bank account verification, or clearly indicate anywhere that it would be required?  Because people wouldn't sign up if they did that.  I sure wouldn't have.  And now, my money is being held for ransom, it would seem.<p>I emailed their support, and was told that I must upload a photo ID to proceed, or I can call their support line to get my money transferred.  So, I called support.  I was extremely frustrated by the time I made the call, but it went okay.  They stated that they would allow the transfer through this one time, then suspend my account unless and until I uploaded a photo ID.  This was fine, I told them, and assumed I was all set.  Sixteen hours later, another email stating that I need to verify my account for any action on my withdrawal to proceed.  What?<p>I called support again to see what the issue was.  I was told that while my account was temporarily verified yesterday, the verification team put it back in the 'requires ID' status, with no exceptions.  I again asked if I could transfer the money to my bank account - NO.  I asked if the money could be returned to the consultant that sent it to me, then he could just write a physical check - NO.  The only options I have are to upload a photo ID, or forfeit the money.<p>Are my concerns unjustified here?  Do I have any other options?  I am realistically about a week and a half from running out of money.<p>Thanks.<p>[OT - Shameless beg for charity: If anyone is in need of freelance development work, and is feeling charitable, I do good work, and would very much appreciate any opportunity to help.

Finding ""references to foo"" is a good example.<p>But here's some stuff Qt Creator can't do (or rather, provides no particular support for -- you can always use it as a text editor, of course): iOS apps; Android apps; sending email automatically; kernel drivers; languages other than C++ or Javascript: Scala, Haskell, TCL, C#, sh, perl, prolog, lisp...; build and deploy a node.js app; fire up an AWS instance; build a binary for an AVR microcontroller and download it to a device; Verilog or VHDL editing/synthesis/verification.<p>Obviously I could go on and on, but you get the point.  The command line environment?  Yeah.  It ""does"" all that stuff.  And it <i>does it in the same way</i>.  A Makefile for your VHDL project is going to look like a Makefile for your web app.  The build scripts for your machine learning rig and your AVR hackery work the same way.  You write your email in the same editor you use to write your C++ and CoffeeScript (and that you used 20 years ago to write your TCL!).<p>So sure: if you want to spend your career searching for ""foo"" in your Qt C++/QML projects, Qt Creator is a great choice.

Algebra over the field of reals, Banach Algebra, relational algebra, boolean algebra, sigma algebra etc. ) The ""rules"" are really constructs you decide that apply to the elements of the space that conform to your algebra. So for example the reals are a field that have ordering, so you can talk about less than and greater than, but the complex numbers don't have an imposed order and you'd have to first define a norm to map them onto the reals. The AltDragonBox with its own inconsistent arbitrary rules will still have some algebraic encoding. Whether that's useful to you is debatable. Like in my algebra I could overload plus to mean multiply and square root to mean divide by 7 and add -3 and then try to figure out what exponentiation works out to. It would be interesting...maybe not useful, but its still an algebra. Maybe you won't have closure...the elements may not end up in a field or even in a semigroup...its a nice make-believe algebra.",1339611057

For a variety of reasons, I have put that on the shelf, and as my savings is nearly gone, I have been pursuing freelance work to try to stay afloat while I figure things out.<p>And that is where this story begins.  I completed a 3-week freelance job, sent the invoice, and was told by the consultant that they pay via Dwolla, so I should setup an account there and he would send my payment.  I did this.  The initial portion of the setup process was fairly simple, fill in a few fields, and you're setup.  The only field that caused me to hesitate was SSN, but I decided to proceed.  After that, I started the process of linking up a bank account, which takes about 2 days as they ACH a few cents to your account and have you verify.  So far, so good, I can see it's going to take longer to get my money than I'd hoped, but nothing too concerning yet.<p>After my account was setup, and bank account verified, I let the consultant know the ID to send payment to.  A day later, I received notice that the payment had been sent.  After spending some time trying to transfer that payment to my bank account, I finally found that the payment takes a full week to clear and be available in my Dwolla account.  OK, I figured, things move pretty slow at Dwolla, so I'd better stay on top of it and make the transfer to my bank account the instant the funds clear.<p>A week later, yesterday morning, I received notification that the payment had finally cleared, and was available in my Dwolla account.  I logged in, and initiated the transfer of the funds to my previously verified bank account.  They claimed that it would take another 3-5 business days to complete that transfer.  This is where the trouble started.<p>A few hours later, I received an email from Dwolla stating that I must verify my account by uploading a scanned image of my driver's license or passport, before any action can continue on my withdrawal of funds.  I'm sorry, I don't want to give an electronic copy of my driver's license to some startup with millions of dollars in lawsuits already pending against it...my own banks don't even have copies of my driver's license, just the number.  Why did they not ask for this during my account setup or bank account verification, or clearly indicate anywhere that it would be required?  Because people wouldn't sign up if they did that.  I sure wouldn't have.  And now, my money is being held for ransom, it would seem.<p>I emailed their support, and was told that I must upload a photo ID to proceed, or I can call their support line to get my money transferred.  So, I called support.  I was extremely frustrated by the time I made the call, but it went okay.  They stated that they would allow the transfer through this one time, then suspend my account unless and until I uploaded a photo ID.  This was fine, I told them, and assumed I was all set.  Sixteen hours later, another email stating that I need to verify my account for any action on my withdrawal to proceed.  What?<p>I called support again to see what the issue was.  I was told that while my account was temporarily verified yesterday, the verification team put it back in the 'requires ID' status, with no exceptions.  I again asked if I could transfer the money to my bank account - NO.  I asked if the money could be returned to the consultant that sent it to me, then he could just write a physical check - NO.  The only options I have are to upload a photo ID, or forfeit the money.<p>Are my concerns unjustified here?  Do I have any other options?  I am realistically about a week and a half from running out of money.<p>Thanks.<p>[OT - Shameless beg for charity: If anyone is in need of freelance development work, and is feeling charitable, please see info in profile.]",1339610879

Invincibility cheats can be as simple as the client updating its position the moment it knows there is a projectile traveling towards it, or the moment another player is turned to face them they duck.<p>For Counter Strike: Source for example the server sends the location, and way that a user is pointing to the client. With some calculations you can then draw a line from the other players to where their bullets would go if they fired. Using that knowledge you can find where your hitboxes are and simply make sure that you are never in the path of their line of sight!<p>That is how wallhacks work as well, the client knows where the other players are so that sound can be properly calculated (so if they are further away and they fire their gun you hear less of a shooting sound and you hear a louder sound when they are closer).<p>Healthpoints are generally stored server side (at least for the games I've been RE'ing for fun lately), but even then you can cheat, if you have portable med kits you can take at any time, as soon as you drop below a certain percentage you take one, now hack the client to have unlimited health kits and you are set. Keeping everything and all variables on the server is impossible, mainly due to lag the game would become unplayable, and due to having so many variables to calculate there is always something you have to trust the client with (position being the biggest one, you can't take all user input, send it to the server, and then send back where the character should now be).<p>The faster internet connections become the more feasible it is to have a client that just renders the result and have all of the computations done on a remote server somewhere. Kinda like RDP for games. But until the game companies then also put the servers close enough by the user and build the game experience to equalise between different ping times (something CS:S attempts to do but fails at quite well, thus allowing people with AWP's to kill people that are not even near where they were scoping due to timing delays) it is going to be a huge mess and gamers will hate it.",1339610785

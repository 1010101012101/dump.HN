Just in case here is the current text:<p>NIC.ly rules and regulations were set by the local Libyan internet community (in accordance with best practices for ccTLDs) to reflect it’s identity and content. It’s a bottom up module in which the Community’s feedback, opinions and remarks are taken into decision-making consideration, and it is our duty to uphold these rules and regulations to serve the better interests of the community we represent.<p>In reference to the vb.ly incident: the domain’s purpose (proclaimed by its registrants themselves) was to serve as a ‘sex friendly URL shortener’, mainly for adult uses. This means that vb.ly had a policy different than the other URL shorteners, not using filters and encouraging the use of this service for creating links to adult sites and other “NSFW” links, thus placing vb.ly by definition in the porn/adult site category. \nThis use was deemed as unacceptable by our local internet community, regardless of whether or not the site hosts adult material or redirects traffic to 3rd party sites<p>Contrary to vb.ly’s claims, they were contacted on numerous occasions to investigate these concerns, and over the course of these contacts vb.ly has ignored our efforts and even changed their contact numbers.<p>When our repeated warnings were ignored, and after over 3 weeks of failed attempts to contact the owners of vb.ly, NIC.ly had no alternative but to apply its regulations that clearly state that it reserves the right to suspend or remove a .ly domain name in violation of rules and regulations. The domain has also been excluded from future registrations so that no other entity (local or abroad) can re-register it.<p>As to the decision to keep the registration of domain names shorter than 4 symbols long under .ly only for entities with a local Libyan presence, this comes in accordance with NIC.ly’s concern that the rise in popularity of URL shorteners from abroad taking up all these names has deprived locals of their right to register the important 3 letter abbreviations of their various businesses and interests. We as a Registry would prefer seeing art.ly used for a website about Libyan art for instance, or lda.ly used by the Libyan De-mining Association, rather than adding more URL shorteners under our National TLD. \nFor over 5 years, we as a Libyan Registry recognized by ICANN have been open for domain name registrations from all around the Globe, and we pride ourselves on being the online destination of thousands of domain names from all over the World. Over this span of time never once have we abused the trust invested in us by the Global internet community, nor have we ever taken advantage of having an attractive extension like ‘.ly’. Only when our Community's rules and regulations were compromised was when we had to act.",1286556934

1772260,comment,1771796,1771925,0,0,lkrubner,,,"It is a little sad to rewind the tape and go back to 1999, when both MySql and PostGres were talked about as being roughly equal. MySql had not yet taken over open source databases yet. MySql was greatly helped by the rise of PHP - I think those 2 technologies grew up together, and leaned on each other. But I also recall, when I was learning PHP in 1999, most PHP books devoted some time to Postgres. And PHP supported Postgres from the beginning. It wasn't till a few years later that I started to see book titles like ""PHP/MySql development for beginners"" as if those 2 technologies just naturally belonged together.<p>I recall when Tim Perdue published this article in 2000, and the strong impression it made on me that PostGres was the much better database:<p><a href=""http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/tim20000705.php3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/tim20000705.php3</a><p>Tim found that PostGres could scale:<p>""The most interesting thing about my test results was to see how much of a load Postgres could withstand before giving any errors. In fact, Postgres seemed to scale 3 times higher than MySQL before giving any errors at all. MySQL begins collapsing at about 40-50 concurrent connections, whereas Postgres handily scaled to 120 before balking. My guess is, that Postgres could have gone far past 120 connections with enough memory and CPU.""<p>At that time, circa 2000, developers often claimed that they could live without ACID reliability, in exchange for speed. Thus, there preference was for MySql. There is something to that argument of course. In recent years, the NoSql movement has gone much further, throwing out integrity as a concern, in exchange for massive scaling and fast speed.<p>Somehow, lost in the shuffle was the fact Postgres is, in most ways, technologically superior to MySql. It may not be as fast as MySql, in some situations, but for a wide range of purposes, it should be really be preferred to MySql. And I think, somehow, developers have often forgotten that, for a wide range of purposes, the best choice would be Postgres.",1286556687

1772258,comment,1770461,1771513,0,0,thwarted,,,"There's no doubt that a $50 charge is a significant hurdle to overcome for someone wanting to ballot box stuff <i>using a bot</i> on a review site, but for this to be a legit contrast to ""free"" or ""anonymous"" services, you have to assume that the free/anonymous sites are overrun with bots stuffing the ratings. Each review/vote counts for more if there are less of them.  Look at any on-line review site: the wide majority of the entries have at most a <i>handful</i> of reviews/ratings.  In order to attempt to influence that one way or another, you only need to have an extended family-size worth of accounts (""Hey cousin Bob, use angieslist to find your next plumber, then can you write a negative review of my landscaping competitor?"").  The key is how the site mitigates that.  angieslist charges $50 to discourage it -- angieslist also discourages it by having reviews of services you don't continuously need/use a lot of (how many painters can one person hire and review?).  Yelp has automated review filtering technology.  I assume Google has some algorithmic method.  I don't know what citysearch does.  I don't think <i>which</i> method you use to discourage/mitigate ballot box stuffing matters as much as that you do have <i>something</i>.<p>On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog, and nobody will even <i>suspect</i> you're a dog if you have $50.  Exactly how much verification of the accounts occur?  I guess for $50, angieslist can afford to follow up on every account.  But in order for that to be effective, the people who pay $50 have to think they are getting $50 worth of service/benefit out of it.  It seems to be effective in angieslist case.  I, personally, don't use enough of the kinds of services that angieslist lists in order for $50 to be worth it (although, I guess getting screwed for $51 by some shady service provider just once might be enough to make it worth it).",1286556666

You guys really poured out good ideas and several of you offered me work.<p>Patio11 was among those: he offered to pay me 400 USD a month, every month, to make a custom Wordpress theme for him. I took him up on it. His offer really helped. The ability to hammer out a Wordpress theme and cover my living costs in a short period of time meant that I could hire out someone else to do the tasks that were taking all of my time to pay for my food and rent. With the new-found free time, I was able to focus on marketing and sales and grow the service I had been doing myself into a larger business. By the time the 2nd Wordpress theme was due, I had run overdue on its deadline because my tiny business had been covered by some major media and I was swamped with just keeping it up and running. Thankfully Patrick was understanding when I turned in the late 2nd project and told him I simply had no more time to design for him due to my personal business's growth.<p>Fast-forward a few months. I now have 5 people working under me (3 full-time, 2 part-time) and my own office. Things are still hard, and I'm not rich, but I'm in a much better place than I was when I first posted.

I think some traffic will be lost by people typing in spu.com or even spuco.com, but how much is anyone's guess.  I think the more general-purpose your website (and therefore audience) the larger a percentage you're going to lose due to typos/unfamiliarity with the TLD.<p>Since my website is more of a collection of stuff I've made and I'm not going to be marketing it heavily, I think it'll be okay. The traffic it gets will likely be through links where the person doesn't have to type the domain in. An easy question to ask yourself:  will you ever be putting the domain in print materials/advertising?  If you can see yourself wanting to market your website in print, the .co will be more of an issue than if the only marketing you do is online, where the site will be linked and the visitor only has to click the link, not type anything in.<p>There are some people who absolutely refuse to use anything but .com/.net/.org, or even those who ONLY use .com, and there's valid evidence out there making their case -- del.icio.us changing to delicious.com, or the fact that microsoft has bought nearly every typographical misspelling of their brand that you can think of, for example.<p>And then there's the additional issue that .co is technically the ccTLD (country-code) of the Republic of Colombia, even though it's available worldwide for registration.  With the .ly issue or non-issue, depending on which side you're on, that's arisen recently it could be argued that any ccTLD is potentially at risk.<p>Personal opinion?  I think it works fine for what I'm using it and don't regret my decision.  But then I love short domains (I also own <a href=""http://pzxc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pzxc.com</a> and <a href=""http://6d7.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://6d7.com</a>, and used to own <a href=""http://ui.cx/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ui.cx/</a> but gave it up partly for these reasons we're discussing here but mainly because I <i>had</i> to use the Christmas Island registrar for that one instead of my normal registrar, which was annoying).<p>However if I was using it for a massive site trying to make oodles of money off of it, my opinion might change.

A lot of people here seem to look down on someone who just works his ass off and gets the job done unless that person has a web presence and a github repository. Why would a guy like this even have a blog? Why would he care about our opinions of him? The contrast is striking between the blogging, coding-a-personal-project nature of our generation of programmers and the get-things-done-efficiently-and-go-have-fun nature of an entirely different generation. Many miss that ""completes entire projects by himself"" and ""razor-like focus"" often preclude many of the activities we now expect to see in a good programmer. Many think that if a programmer is not giving something away for free -- likely something that few will use or read -- then he is just a hamster-wheel cubicle drone.<p>Your comment reminded me that the reality of the programming world is that there are countless unsung amazing programmers who have stuck to the same platform for years, if not decades. They know their IDEs, libraries, and code bases inside and out. They get an assignment, go into crazy-productive genius-coder mode, and get a high quality product out the door. And then they go home and enjoy themselves, and none of us are the wiser. But we sure do appreciate the reliability of our cell phone networks, our vehicle computer systems, and countless other amazing pieces of software that we take for granted.

These are two very different things - Investors are going to have a pretty rigid set of expectations that will probably vary from firm to firm - there are probably also certain legal requirements that need to be fulfilled depending on how the startup is structured legally. I can't speak to that specifically because I'm not on the biz side.<p>Internally, my personal opinion is that a (traditional)startup is built with blood sweat and tears. You can't afford to have a hierarchy of haves and have-nots when it comes to buy in. Everybody needs to have a voice, and everyone needs to be enabled to invest emotionally in the process. You can't buy the kind of passion that comes from being personally invested in a company or project.

That's a direct quote.<p>I considered this arrogant comment, and I realized how useful it was. There was no point in patenting graphene at that stage. You need to be specific: you need to have a specific application and an industrial partner. Unfortunately, in many countries, including this one, people think that applying for a patent is an achievement. In my case it would have been a waste of taxpayers' money.</i><p>Crazy",1286553899

I disagree with your original premise that all these people making Facebook games would (or even could) be solving the world's problems in completely unrelated sectors if market forces were aligned differently. This is the long standing hubris of the programmer, and you see it all the time on blogs and online forums, dating way back to the USENET era. If only I didn't have to do my boring job, I'd be a brain surgeon and a rock star, invent organic gasoline, do angelina jolie and natalie portman at the same time, and maybe even reconcile quantum physics with newtonian mechanics as a side hobby.<p>This mindset has recently expanded into the popular consciousness, with opinion pieces by every jowly conservatively liberal political columnist, and even stated by the president of the united states, who publicly lamented the fact that all these engineers are engineering themselves more money in the stock market instead of engineering up some new fuel sources. (The messed up part about that, is all those talking heads have degrees in journalism and law. Fuck you and get back to me after you pass freshman physics...) I just don't believe the notion that any somewhat smart person can be successful at anything to be true. People tend to self-select into careers they think they'll be sort of good at. I've worked in both science and e-commerce, and most of the e-commerce people would be bad at science, and most of the scientists would be bad at e-commerce. I just happened to be able to work in both fields because they both need big databases. I honestly don't believe we've lost any great scientists or nobel peace prize winners to Zygna.<p>The notion that skills are fungible at such a high level is like saying that if only Americans cared about soccer, the members of the Yankees would be winning the world cup instead of wasting their time playing baseball. It's ridiculous.<p>I don't really get your example, though. A decade ago, the people who are coding social networks today were 12. I don't think they had a lot of financial angst driving them away from their 6th grade research careers.",1286553808

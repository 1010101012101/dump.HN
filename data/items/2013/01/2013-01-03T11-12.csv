5001956,comment,4996215,4999719,1,0,kelnos,,,"Thing is, though, under normal situations, that scenario with Enterprise could have been <i>much</i> better, and ZipCar might not have been so great:<p>* You live in a popular neighborhood in SF with lots of nearby ZipCar lots.  Many people do not have that luxury.<p>* ZipCar was more flexible for a holiday rental.  Fine.  Any non-holiday Enterprise rental would not have had that problem.<p>* The credit card issue: you're in the minority.  Most of us are fine with having a credit card and even many of us use it as more of a ""charge"" card, just as a buffer between the merchant and our bank accounts (not to mention cash back, airline miles, etc.).  I'm not trying to say ""change your ways""; I'm merely pointing out that this was a special situation for you in particular, and that most people would not have to jump through these hoops to rent a car from Enterprise.<p>* The last time I rented a car, they had someone come pick me up and take me to the rental location, free of charge.  Maybe Enterprise (or the rental location you were looking at) doesn't offer this service, or maybe their policies have changed, but many car rental companies will do this for you.  Yes, it's still more convenient to walk a block to a lot to get your car, but a driver picking you up is still pretty damn convenient.  Not to mention that you know when you get there that the car will actually be there, and be clean.<p>So in the end, you're condemning traditional car rental services mainly for things surrounding your special circumstances, which is a bit unfair.  On the other hand, it's great that ZipCar is there to cater to your needs!  The bottom line is that ZipCar got you where you needed to go, and under terms you found acceptable.  Definitely a win.<p>On an off-ish-topic side note, I do own my own car (and live and work in SF), and despite how often I tell myself I should just get rid of it, stories like this make me very glad I haven't, despite how much money I'd save without it.  I hate having to depend on others so deeply for transportation, with no fallback plan should the stars completely misalign.<p>(Disclaimer: I own a small amount of ZIP stock, which hopefully will be above water again soon.)",1357214119

In this particular context, the 15-20% rule of thumb for cars does refer to declining balance, which does reflect the market value of cars more closely.<p>If it were straight line though, you could just have a predetermined residual value for a specific useful life of the asset, and then depreciate the percentage of the difference from the original value and the residual value each year. You can also easily have depreciation where the residual value is less than the fair market value at the end of the asset's useful life or stated period though.

No; we will see more facism; the collapse will be blamed on the country not being godly enough by the conservatives, and on capitalists being too greedy by the liberals, who will insist on running even farther from economic freedom (and prosperity).<p>You say ""we"", as if in that scenario you'd still be there.<p>I see no other practical method of getting the US government off the fiber backbones and out of the closets of carriers short of undermining the country's competitive advantage in the world economy, and even that will take dozens of years.<p>The USA PATRIOT Act was 10 years old in October of 2011.  The 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th amendments are dead and buried, and the only response to new laws further abridging those rights we used to have under them is ""lol"" (e.g. The Daily Show, Colbert Report).<p>It's delusional to think that it's going to somehow get better when doing so would require large popular support from people who really don't give a fuck about anything and can't be effectively reached en masse save via military-industrial-complex controlled mass media channels that dissenting opinions aren't given access to (e.g. the most recent series of presidential debates).",1357213430

I'm sufficing with Hiccup for now, but it's a far cry from ERb and Jinja templates. Doing something relatively simple like pagination is out-and-out irritating in Hiccup. Kicking up random template overrides like for headers, footers, title tags, etc are more annoying in Hiccup and Ring.<p>This is partly due to the fact that in order to have a parent with a bunch of children functions generating the HTML, the only way to override is to manually and explicitly kick a map of data from the handler to the template function and back to the parent being overridden.<p>The only indication I've seen that anybody in the Clojure world truly understands the needs of web development is Kiln.<p><a href=""https://github.com/straszheimjeffrey/The-Kiln"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/straszheimjeffrey/The-Kiln</a><p>Most others I've spoken to have brushed off my concerns as trivial.

5001842,comment,5001437,5001650,7,0,michael_miller,,,"To be fair, they already have an Apple Store: store.apple.com (it's marketed as ""Apple Store""). Also, they do put a pretty prominent Apple logo on each device: notebooks with nothing but a glowing logo on the back, iPhones / iPads with a reflective metallic logo, heck, even the power chargers have an embossed logo on them.<p>I'm not sure whether Apple should be able to patent the name ""App Store,"" but it certainly does raise a question of what a brand is. Surely, before the iPhone, people off the street would be confused by the term ""App Store"". Yet, after the iPhone (iOS >= 2), you could pull someone off the street and they would say something like ""oh yeah, that's where you buy apps for the iPhone."" So I don't think it's reasonable to dispute that Apple popularized the term ""App Store,"" essentially invented it in the public eye. That said, it is a store to buy applications, which Apple did not invent, even in the public eye.<p>There are lots of terms / brands which encode the product in the name in a fairly obvious manner. Should American Airlines be allowed to use that as their brand? Or is it too generic, given that there are many airlines based in America? Should a brand like KitchenAid be able to patent their name? Or is it too obvious of a name, given that the company produces aids in the kitchen? Should uniqlo be able to patent the term heattech, or is it obvious given that it's a technology designed to preserve heat? It's a very difficult distinction to make, and I'm not sure which side is right.",1357211211

There was little difference between what they knew and how they acted - there was their own tribe, and there were other tribes - and people today, where you can see cliques and groups naturally form in schools and elsewhere.<p>> epidemics that wiped out their whole tribes.<p>These things were supremely rare. As the article notes, the rise of death by disease at scale was a direct result of higher population and density, as well as likely poorer sanitary conditions.<p>Let us presume a disease randomly shows up and infects a tribe, killing all of them. Now what? The disease dies out. In fact, our tribal nature is in effect a preventative measure against precisely this, as it causes most human societies to develop boundaries with each other. A deadly disease survives by spreading, which is a difficult thing to do in a world of tribal societies.<p>> Which I also think kept their population growth in check.<p>All animal populations are kept in control by basic ecology - when there's enough food to support a larger population, the population grows; when there is not, it does not. Humans are no different (until modern times with birth control/women empowerment/etc.)<p>> Agriculture seems to be a inevitable step for any intelligent species to take if they want to live in organized ways like societies, states and countries.<p>This is an interesting point. Agriculture has allowed larger societies (tribes are organized societies, and good ones), but not better ones (yet). I don't find this particularly surprising - a highly refined technology or method is almost always better than a newer one, even if the newer one eventually equals and surpasses it. The gun took hundreds of years to replace the sword, the car decades to replace the horse, and today we see new forms of energy production gradually moving to replace oil. Humans and developments in human society are no different - agriculture is the only way to support larger societies, but we have yet to correct for all the problems it brings that tribal societies had long since solved.",1357211022

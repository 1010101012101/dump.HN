3561538,comment,3560616,3560800,3,0,MatthewPhillips,,,"> So for instance all calls to the server API have to be callback style; if you have to make serial calls, you can't avoid nested callbacks.<p>I hear this over and over again but I frankly do not get it. I write JavaScript every day and got over the nested callback problem ages ago. I don't say this to refute the point; I legitimately don't get it and feel like maybe I'm doing something wrong because I don't encounter the problem. Here's how I write stuff that requires several callbacks:<p><pre><code>  function TakesAWhile() {
 
  }
 
  TakesAWhile.prototype = {
 	start: function() {
 		var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
 		xhr.open('POST', 'api/foo', true);
 		xhr.onreadystatechange = this.posted.bind(this);
 		xhr.send('bar');
 	},
 	
 	posted: function(e) {
 		if(!(e.target.readyState !== 4)) {
 			this.complete('error :-(');
 			return;
 		}
 		
 		db.saveSomething(someObject, this.saved.bind(this));
 	},
 	
 	saved: function(e) {
 		db.getFreshCopy('foo', this.got.bind(this));
 	},
	
 	got: function(e) {
 		var foo = e.target.result;
 		this.complete(foo);
 	}
 };
</code></pre>
Then I consume it like this:<p><pre><code>  var stuff = new TakesAWhile();
  stuff.complete = function(foo) {
  	console.log('All complete!');
  };
  stuff.start();</code></pre>",1328619372

Every time I am forced (read: paid) to use Xcode for some project, not only do I dislike the fact that I have to dig out my macbook because Apple's tools don't work on any other platform, but I find actually using them painful.""<p>I think it all depends on what you compare XCode with, and what kind of applications you are developing.<p>Personally, I find all IDE's painful to use, compared to just editing with gvim and building/testing using command-line tools. The fundamental problem with IDE's is that they are supposed to integrate a complete development workflow, which is never the same workflow you are used to, and which adds layers of complexity that are usually completely unnecessary if you write your own build & test scripts, customized for each project.<p>That said, of all the IDE's I've used over time, XCode is easily the best. There has been a regression from XCode 3 to XCode 4 in some ways, but it's getting better. I'd say the quality of the total XCode package is on par with Visual Studio, which is saying a lot. Environments such as Netbeans or Eclipse don't even come close to XCode 4 in terms of user friendlyness, speed, and integration.<p>If it were even remotely possible, I'd develop iOS and OS X applications using just gvim and command-line tools, but it simply isn't possible to get all the UI work, storyboarding, CoreData model creation, etc. done without something like XCode.<p>Personally, I think it's very hard to maintain that XCode is not a great tool for the problems it is supposed to solve, especially if Apple gets around to fixing all the (minor) regressions they introduced with XCode 4.",1328619355

3561531,comment,3559631,3559631,3,0,cnunciato,,,"The timing of these posts amazes me sometimes.<p>I just turned down an opportunity to join an early stage startup (would've been employee #4, engineer #2, leading a team) that was uncommonly well backed, led by a seasoned founder, and tasked to build some truly bad-ass technology.  I've always been drawn to startups, and this was indeed a rare one, unique in my experience so far, and particularly well suited to my sensibilities and to the direction I'd been wanting to go in my career.  Closest thing to a perfect opportunity yet, to be sure.  But it required some travel (half-dozen or so trips a year overseas, week or so each, give or take, probably more), and would've surely required longer hours than I work now (generally 40, sometimes less).  We have two young boys (ages 1 and 2 1/2) and a third due in August.  My wife, ever my champion, did nothing but encourage me to take it.<p>But I couldn't do it.  My dad traveled constantly while my sisters and I were growing up (still does, actually -- very successful, but physically and often mentally absent), and I've always promised myself I'd never make that mistake.  It was by far the toughest professional decision I've ever had to make, was emotionally and physically draining (I lost much sleep over it, spanning several days), but ultimately right -- for me, anyway.  Much as it might restrict me career-wise, I work to live, don't live to work, and I'm not willing to risk regretting lost time with my boys because of work I chose for myself over them.  I can't imagine a future in which any of us would look back and say that was worth it.<p>Many thanks indeed to you, Jeff -- you all did build something awesome.  As my dad would say, Now go have fun.",1328619254

The idea of doing destructive deletes of branches is madness. However, if you don't, you end up in the situation I have now, where my project has over a hundred branches, most of them minor changes or attempts at things that didn't pan out.<p>The overhead this causes (including, just scrolling through the list of branches) now makes me less eager to branch in new projects I work on.

This new release supports rendering of comments in Microsoft Word to fixed-page formats such as PDF. The output is similar to how Microsoft Word renders comments to formats like PDF. There were a large number of requests from our customers to find a way to decrease the size of rendered PDF documents. The latest version of Aspose.Words introduces new options which allow you to choose how fonts are exported to PDF, either by using standard core PDF fonts or system installed fonts instead of embedding them into the document. Using either one of these options results in significant reduction in the file size of PDFs generated using Aspose.Words. Note that these options are mutually exclusive so you should choose only one at a time to use for your particular needs. Previous versions of Aspose.Words use standard GDI+ objects for rendering compound (multiline) lines. This worked well when rendering directly to image, but such document formats as PDF and XPS have no explicit support for compound lines. The only way to render such lines types to these formats is to draw them as a set of normal lines. This technique has been implemented and is now available in the latest version of Aspose.Words.",1328617380

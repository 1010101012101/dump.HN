4071962,comment,4070363,4070827,4,0,rdtsc,,,"> Criticizing legitimate American counter-terrorism and counter espionage and suggesting that it's equivalent to China's suppression of thought of its citizens (and people in occupied zones like Tibet) are disingenuous.<p>However, what is not disingenuous is characterizing American behavior vis-a-vis the propaganda it espouses.  That is a good test for any institution or country. Don't even need China here.  Compare what happens in US and what US does internationally vs. what US govt and many of its citizens believe or tell others about America. ""We are a beacon of democracy "" that's a common idea. So now let's see how is the power distributed in US? Does the average citizen have the power to make decision and is that comparable to what the propaganda fantasy is promoting.  How about another one ""US Constitution protects us from unreasonable searches and severely restricts the power of the government from invading our privacy"". A lot of people believe that (doesn't matter if they are Americans or not). Is that true compared to the number of people believing in that? I say it is not. A lot of people are living a lie, believing in a fantasy about the government that is not based in reality.  I say that is unhealthy.<p>Something similar is happening in China or other repressive governments. People are lead to believe in things that are divorced from reality. ""We are a paradise"". ""American Imperialists are out to destroy US"" and so on.<p>There is actually one difference. In some countries (and I can speak for the former Soviet Union during its last days) people knew propaganda was lie and they laughed at it in private. We knew the image we were supposed to have about our country was false. Many Americans are not aware of it. The brainwashing is so effective, they actually believe we are exporting democracy in the Middle East. They believe we have the best health care system . Heck, many believe evolution is a big lie. There is a great amount of self delusion and self censorship. That is unhealthy.<p>So going back to the comparison. You are right, comparing US to China in absolute terms in certain areas, is like night and day. Say, when it comes to freedom of speech. You can grab a megaphone and go yell out crazy conspiracy stuff right by Obama's front gate. But if you look at the level of delusion, the situation, I think is not as great.",1338946876

4071958,comment,4069223,4071062,2,0,danudey,,,"One of the issues I've run into in the past was a MySQL problem where their system was creating tons of temporary tables, and because of the massive amount of traffic they were getting, it was killing their database server because it was choking out the disk's I/O, and the server was at 80% iowait most of the time because the disk cache was paging things in and out like crazy.<p>I went back and forth with them about optimizing the app, but it was apparently some huge labyrinthine monstrosity. They insisted that they didn't have the resources to do any of the significant rewrites that it would require to fix the app to do proper queries (or at least, not enough to be worthwhile).<p>Eventually I gave up. /tmp was mounted onto a separate partition, so I disabled ext3 journalling and set commit=30 so that it only sync'ed to the disk every 30 seconds. Since no temporary tables lasted that long, the VFS layer never wrote to the disk if it didn't have to. /tmp became an in-memory cache, and CPU use dropped to 5%.<p>Optimizing isn't about a checklist, it's about looking at the system that you have, understanding what it's doing and why, and understanding how the other systems around it behave so that you can resolve the issue. Moving onto another database server wouldn't have helped them. Moving onto a RAID would have reduced the impact, but their load didn't scale linearly so they'd hit their limit in a few months anyway.",1338946761

The broad outlines of the so-called warrantless-wiretapping program have long been exposedhow the NSA secretly and illegally bypassed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which was supposed to oversee and authorize highly targeted domestic eavesdropping; how the program allowed wholesale monitoring of millions of American phone calls and email. In the wake of the programs exposure, Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which largely made the practices legal.

It should be no surprise that our food cravings are among them.<p>There are other fun examples. One is that our breathing reflex is based on CO2 concentration being too high rather than O2 concentration being too low, even though O2 concentration is more important! Breathe into a closed system with a CO2 scrubber in it and you'll quickly get loopy and then pass out from lack of oxygen (and then die, if nobody disconnects you) all the while feeling fine. Another is that the iris of the eye responds to visible light but protects against more. Looking at the Sun is normally OK (uncomfortable, but tolerable) because the feedback is set up properly, but during the totality of a solar eclipse (which of course occurred back then, but not often enough to matter, apparently) your iris will crank open and let in tons of UV from the Sun's still-visible corona, frying your retina if you look at it.<p>It makes a great deal of sense that we'd evolve strong cravings for things which are good for us in small quantities but bad for us in large quantities when those things were scarce in the distant past, and death came early by other means for other people, well before a bad long-term diet could kill. That doesn't mean this must be what happened, but given how much humans love sugar, and how rare concentrated sugar would have been for our ancestors, it's no surprise if sugar turns out to be bad for us when consumed in the quantities we really want.",1338946235

And in fact, many serve in the Knesset, and the army.<p>""Why are you mixing citizenship with ethnicity?"" It's the ethnicity that they use to profile.<p>""using the same scale, what is the percentage of violence committed against Arabs by Israelis?"" I don't know. More Arabs are killed by other Arabs than by Israelis. If you're talking about just Palestinians, yes, it would be by Israelis.<p>""Don't some of those fall into the category of ""terror attack""?"" No. No. No. That's the biggest problem with education about the conflict. How do you define a ""terror attack""? I define it as violent acts towards civilians with the intent of causing mass psychological damage. Israel does not commit such acts. They attack military targets in the Gaza Strip, and sometimes kill civilians, as any army in the world has had the difficult issue of doing. A British soldier stood up in the UN and proclaimed that during the last Israeli/Gaza offensive (operation cast lead), Israel did more to protect Gazan civilians than any nation has ever done previously (<a href=""http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&b=1313923&ct=7536409"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKI...</a>). He was referring to the Goldstone report, which was later rescinded and apologized for.<p>""Isn't there a power imbalance which prevents Arabs from profiling and being able to restrict what Israelis can do?"" No, not at all. Try getting into Egypt with an Israeli passport. Multiple acquaintances that have were harassed by Egyptian police. In actuality, it is much more difficult for Israelis in Arab countries than it is for Arabs in Israel.<p>""If Arabs were able to profile and exclude certain classes of people, wouldn't that help stop further ""countless terror attacks"" against them?"" What terrorist attacks?<p>""If I understand your view rightly, I think you are in favor of having the Israelis out of the West Bank, as that would reduce the overall amount of attacks. Is that correct?"" I am 100% for a two-state solution with two people living side by side peacefully. Settlements in the West Bank are an issue that needs to be figured out. You have to realize that these ""settlements"" are sometimes small, and sometimes (like Ariel) are large cities with thousands of residents. It's not simple to just get them to up and move. Remember, Israel did that (The unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip) and all they have gotten in return is more than 9000 rockets and mortars fired on Israeli citizens.<p>(edit) Ah yes, downvoted for the inconvenient truth.",1338944842

The only two releases with major breakage that should have affected you in recent years are 1.9.1 and 1.9.2.<p>The changes in ruby that break compatibility are listed in the release notes of every release.<p>> Look at Python, with 5-year support for Python 2 before breaking compatibility with Python 3.

4071851,comment,4070363,4071419,9,0,_delirium,,,"There are certainly examples of persecuted dissidents in both countries. What I'm missing in China is any examples of dissidents who've achieved any success, comparable to American examples of dissidents in prominent, even state-sponsored roles. And, in particular, any ability of ordinary people to read and discuss what dissidents write. You and I can discuss Bradley Manning here. And I'll agree he is not being treated in a justifiable manner. Can Chinese citizens openly discuss dissidents, and criticize their governments' treatment of them?<p>For example, after Angela Davis (Black Panther activist) was acquitted, she became a tenured professor at the University of California, where she has, for several decades, continued to unapologetically oppose the United States government. And she's hardly the only one; there are many dissidents who are professors at American universities, some of which are even state-run universities. Noam Chomsky, of course, has not been removed from his professorship at MIT, despite his political views.<p>Are there any prominent Chinese dissidents who are now tenured professors at Chinese universities, without recanting? If we compare to Davis's role as a minority-group activist--- can you imagine a Tibetan or Xinjiang activist, who opposes the Chinese government's rule over those regions, becoming a tenured professor in China? Being able to teach courses openly about those disputes? Being able to publish critical books through the university press, which any ordinary person can order online with a few clicks? All of that happens in the United States, but doesn't happen in China.<p>I'm not hugely into political theory, but I read some of it, mostly tending towards the leftist side. And I am able to buy any of this in the United States, completely openly, even stuff much more radical than what I typically buy. Not even in backrooms or dark alleys, but from Amazon, delivered to my home address with my real name on the label! I can buy manifestos openly urging the overthrow of the United States government (under <i>Brandenburg v. Ohio</i>, these can't be prosecuted as treason).

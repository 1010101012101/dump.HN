Anyhow whether that&#x27;s wholly true or not, I don&#x27;t like google having the data either. However, I do get that it&#x27;s fair on some level since I&#x27;m directly using their service and it&#x27;s been always apparent they monetize it through the data we inherently give them.<p>Where marketing and private intelligence bothers me is when it&#x27;s not obvious to consumers when they&#x27;re providing data. And also it&#x27;s not always expected the ways in which it&#x27;s used. And in the increasingly interconnected world of marketers selling and sharing data, the full implications won&#x27;t be realized for some time.<p>edit:<p>Recently it&#x27;s bothered me more and more that the software world tries to find hidden ways to charge users. It would be like highway construction companies tracking traffic patterns by embedding data sensors in their roads to collect consumer data and while they&#x27;re at it, share it with the government to win some favors. Or like your carpenter going ahead and embedding sensors into the drywall to collect your data to resell and help them generate more revenue. People have paid for stuff directly for a long time and been happy to. But internet companies have this thirst to get millions of users by offering something for free, gambling investor dollars, and hope it pays off huge (which it occasionally does).",1383019015

Or are you saying that the search query is passed unfiltered along with the request for individual ad clicks?<p>AdWords can provide aggregate keyword traffic data easily without compromising privacy.<p>In order for Google Analytics, and similar software, to provide aggregate keyword traffic data, the data would have to be bundled with each request.  The more data a website  receives about you simultaneously, the less privacy you have.  Previously, a website would get your IP address, your user agent and your search query, and at the same time have the ability to inject a tracking cookie.  The IP address I use is registered to me in RIPE, so in my case it would be trivial to connect my search term to my name and address.  If I visited unencrypted sites, secret agents monitoring the Intertubes would be able to store my search queries.  Is this kind of data really available in AdWords?",1383018642

6631794,comment,6630832,6631695,4,0,chas,,,"The basic idea is that it is possible to transform a signal without loss of information from being some value vs time (so called time-domain signals) to being a bunch of different frequencies with different intensities (so called frequency domain) where the frequencies are just sine and cosine waves. A pure sine wave in the time domain gets transformed into just one value with the same amplitude as that wave in the time domain.<p>To see why this is useful, imagine a song you wanted to listen to that was recorded with a low-pitch hum in the background because the microphone running next to a power cable and picked up the 60 Hz signal. Removing this unwanted tone by looking at the value of the song in time is really hard because the 60 Hz signal is mixed up with the rest of the song. However, when transformed into the frequency domain, the 60 Hz hum is very easy to spot and remove. When you transform the signal back into the time-domain (so you can listen to it), the 60 Hz will still be gone.<p>This process can be done automatically with computers using a technique called the Fast Fourier Transform. This is the basis of many techniques in the field of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) which is the theory behind most of the communication breakthroughs of the last 40 years. I should note that many naive approaches to this problem (like the approach in my example) don&#x27;t work particularly well, so as in any problem domain, there are important but subtle performance trade-offs to consider.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dspdimension.com/admin/dft-a-pied/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dspdimension.com/admin/dft-a-pied/</a>",1383017117

Torvalds took an example of an SCM system requiring thirty seconds to apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale to the needs of Linux kernel development, where syncing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at a time.

This is from a mail I wrote some time ago.<p>--<p>As you would know my background is not in EE or CS but in manufacturing where we had very little hands on experience with computers. We had a course where we learned FORTRAN and that was about it. In those days, a pc magazine used to distribute redhat in a CD. I think the first one I got my hands on was version 5.2. The mighty 486s in college used to command a lot of respect, and as lowly undergrads we weren&#x27;t allowed to touch them. I owe Linu[x|s] and Stallman a lot of gratitude because much of what I learned about how a computer works was not from a course but actually digging through the linux and GNU system.<p>This was also quite normal for all linux users then. The whole point of using Linux was to figure out how things work and change things to your liking. &quot;Change&quot; meant editing a file and compiling, not pushing mouse buttons. If you wanted a system that worked [or not], there was always windows. It was very confusing to hear anyone complain that not everything worked right out of the box on Linux. The whole point of Linux then was then to poke around and re-tool it, it was not even expected that everything will work. It was a rudimentary car, that came with an excellent set of tools, a workshop and a manual.<p>If I were to choose a single word to desribe the linux user base that would be &quot;curiosity&quot;. A lot of that has changed, now many use linux not because it allows them to learn and tinker, but because its a better windows. I dont begrudge the fact, it shows Linux has matured.<p>One of my first forays into personal programming was\nbecause of a printer. Printing would always make me cringe because I could not get economy mode or two-up. I barely new C. Over multiple trips to the printer room to check if the patch worked, I finally got it to run. In the process I learned the the entire path from the point one types &quot;lpr\nfilename&quot; to the bits dumped on the network. I also learned how pretty code can be. Deutsch&#x27;s ghostscript code is one of the most beautiful C code around, atleast to me then. I think only way to pick up good coding style is to read good code.<p>To give an example how bad the scenario was then: if you wanted to install something that was not on the CD, doing an apt-get install (or rpm) was out of question over the 2B/s dialup we had then. So I had to hack up a p2p file  distribution system for rpms. It did signature verification and multiple  parallel downloads of the same file broken up into chunks. All I can say is that it did not become napster :) But I learned a lot. Till before that I did not much know what a network even was.<p>I wrote it in TCL (writing that in C would have been way beyond my league) and contributed a patch for TCL&#x27;s FTP client. Given that I was a complete novice, and that this worked at all and that I, a complete clueless newbie\ncould actually contribute anything was unimaginably gratifying for a manufacturing engineering undergrad.<p>TL,DR\nWas taught quite a bit by the GNU and Linux sources",1383016325

For something simple--say comments--you could use an external service like Disqus, but you won&#x27;t be able to do much beyond that without running your own server.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/</a>",1383015737

The end goal is to make it harder for people to manipulate search results in a way that would result in an inferior user experience for searchers.<p>For many years, Google has been a gold mine to a profession called &quot;SEO&quot;. It still is, but every single day it is getting harder to extract value from it if all you do is trying to get your site to the top of the SERPs. Eventually it will be very expensive to trick Google and this is why I see many professional SEOs starting work at big brands or doing consulting for them. It&#x27;s easier to get good rankings for a site that provides great value to users than for another spammy endeavor.<p>I was also involved in this business many years ago, but mainly to rank my sites that were getting traffic anyway because of the value they provided to users. Instead of being angry, I think that SEOs should be thankful that Google made it possible for them to take advantage of their service and even helped them along the way — I am. There is nothing wrong in charging people money for services that they use to make money themselves.<p>SEO should always only be a tool that helps you reach users with your quality product, not your main way of making a living because in itself it creates no value to society.",1383015724

An idea you had for an app or game?<p>There are many different types of programming; as well as many different levels.<p>Web programming isn&#x27;t going away for a while, and it can be useful for doing quite a lot of things. I wrote a quick start guide for beginners like yourself [1] a while ago, that you might find useful.<p>I didn&#x27;t even know HTML six years ago, and have been working full time in the industry for almost three years now. I started out trying to force a piece of forum software into being a community-based website. I quickly got into writing custom add-ons for that forum software. I just kept moving further and further up the food chain until I got to where I am today: being paid to build multiple, complex web applications.<p>The toughest part about learning something <i>completely</i> new is not knowing the right questions to ask. It can be insanely frustrating at times. But if you can stick with it, all the anguish, self-doubt, and sleepless nights will be worth it.

With that said, I&#x27;ve used it for some excellent WordPress projects before, and if you are willing to pay there is quality work there.<p>I prefer using a bootstrap framework to get stuff out there. Depending on the project, I&#x27;ll spend some time customizing the defaults, adding plugins, etc. If the project is small enough, I won&#x27;t even bother with that.\nBringing in a design agency is only useful is you have VC cash to burn. It&#x27;s usually far cheaper/effective to find a design freelancer to partner with. A decent designer can help you create a logo as well, which is an essential step, and something that&#x27;s difficult for laymen to pull off well.<p>Remember the enemy of progress is the perfect. A side project/startup needs to iterate as fast as possible, so it&#x27;s far better to throw something out there than to languish in design mode for months before giving up on your cool idea.<p>For my side projects, my rule of thumb is:\na) the site isn&#x27;t embarrassingly bad, and could be publicly associated with me.\nb) site design took less than 20% of my overall effort on the project.",1383015653

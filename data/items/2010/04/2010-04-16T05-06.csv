1269877,comment,1268738,1269655,0,0,Frazzydee,,,"I'm not sure why you think it's not binding since recognition shifted– the Taiwan Relations Act was passed <i>after</i> the US switched recognition (so you're saying it's never been binding?).  I would presume that any provisions that are phrased as being binding are indeed binding unless the Act is repealed.<p>Maybe you could clarify what you meant by ""binding""? Of course the Act can always be repealed so if you meant that there are no international law obligations, then you're likely correct there.  But I think that as long as the Act is in force, I don't see why it isn't binding.<p>I didn't mean to imply that there was an official military alliance, but the Taiwan Relations Act authorizes the US to treat Taiwan as if it were a foreign country (I assume you can't sell weapons arms to private parties or rogue states).  It also requires the US to make defence articles and services available.<p>Also, the Act leaves some open-ended possibilities that the US won't comment on- most notably military action.  If that's a looming possibility, however unlikely, it will make China think twice before invading Taiwan.<p>IMO if China's going to take over Taiwan, it'll be mostly economically and culturally, not by military might.",1271397427

There are too few launches to do statistics on, but it doesn't seem to me that we can infer from past events that the 6th launch has a 60% failure rate.<p>Cost plus doesn't seem to be helping the situation, but the fact that so much of American space technology is ITAR-controlled seems to be far more detrimental. For those that don't know, ITAR[1] effectively prevents critical spacecraft components from being exported to non-US persons, and even the technical details must be kept secret. All this means is that other countries design and build their own components (including software) from scratch, and American companies can't even compete with them in non-US markets.<p>ITAR is a major hassle, but the consequences are too severe for any company or individual to try to take matters into their own hands (i.e. release ITAR stuff anyways). There needs to be legislation to fix this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITAR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITAR</a>",1271394060

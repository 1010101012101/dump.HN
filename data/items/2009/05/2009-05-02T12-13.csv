People who haven't lived long enough to reproduce have no impact on that figure.<p>There are extreme cases for both genders. While my paternal grandmother had seventeen kids, the comparatively extreme male case probably had well over a hundred. You can only give birth so many times, so the upper bound for women is lower.",1241268902

In order to do some lightweight automated testing from the UI down I started using WATiR; which is pretty cool. However I took this one step further and wrote a DSL on top to speed things up. I call it WSL - WATiR Scripting Language.<p>The ultimate aim is to simplify the API so much that non-devs can use it (ie. testers). I'm hoping to open source this soon but in the meantime you can download the gem and install locally to play around with it. I'm in the process of creating collateral and examples that people can refer to at the linked site, in the process I have learnt a hell of a lot of other skills/technologies, which is really gratifying, but my submission primarily is about WSL so far - What does everyone think?",1241268411

589810,comment,588547,588547,0,0,khandekars,,,"In addition to tracking the calls & durations, it should track the pitch and tone to provide more accurate results. E.g. did a user speak in a melodious voice or had to raise the tone, while speaking with another? Coupled with a statistical model of the specific user's tendency about the tone, will give very precise information.<p>A chilling scenario can be: serve ads to the user for improving pronunciation based on an analysis of their speech.<p>Not sure about the privacy implications, though. Technically, it may or may not be possible to achieve at this stage, since powerful hardware is required for such analysis.",1241268127

It's easy on FB to attend an event, then associate photos with that event and with the people and it's all cross-linked. Even if you download the photos, if you leave FB you lose all that linkage.",1241267794

The number of children a man has is inversely (and counterintuitively) related to the number of sexual partners he's had.<p><a href=""http://anepigone.blogspot.com/2008/10/fewer-sexual-partners-means-more-babies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anepigone.blogspot.com/2008/10/fewer-sexual-partners-...</a><p>You can have all the sex you want, but if it doesn't result in babies it doesn't count (at least not in this context).",1241267538

Running NoScript prevents untrusted sites from exploiting CSRF holes in sites that you care about.<p>That said I don't personally run NoScript (I use Safari), but I totally understand people who do.",1241267355

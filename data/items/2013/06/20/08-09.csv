I&#x27;m struggling with which reactive UI library to go with, but I think I&#x27;m basically down to ember and angular. Here&#x27;s how I want to build my next app:<p>Haskell on the backend. Probably with data in postgres, but using an event sourcing kind of pattern for the bits of state which are edited.<p>Communication between the browser, other systems and the back end should allow separation of query and command (so updates are pushed to the backend state via one channel and pubslished back out via another). However it should be essentially realtime - websockets.<p>Operational transform for edits to the state. I&#x27;m on the fence with this one as I&#x27;m not sure what the overlap is between event sourcing and OT. Anyone who&#x27;s implemented either care to comment? This seems to equate to using sharejs on the front end to marshal changes in the model to the back end and vice versa?<p>I&#x27;d consider using one of the haskell -> js libraries, but I&#x27;d also go with coffeescript here happily. I&#x27;ve played with Fay a bit and sunroof looks good too. Anyone using these?<p>The stuff above has been percolating for a while based on my experiences building the infrastructure for a hedge fund recently, and the gradual evolution from a mostly traditional restful app to a much more realtime system.

There are some random third party (publishers like EA,Activision,Ubi etc) exclusives but from what I can tell Nintendo&#x27;s are just shovel-ware (such as Carnival Games, variously branded &quot;fitness&quot; games, cartoon licensed titles etc.) while both Sony and MS enjoyed some AAA third party exclusives. There is no reason to believe the situation is going to change in the future - if anything it&#x27;s going to be less of those since the major producer of Nintendo exclusive shovel-ware, THQ Inc, went bankrupt recently.<p>Out of the three console majors, Nintendo has the least first party studios - 7 (at least 3 of which are working on handhelds exclusively). Microsoft has the most. And Sony has the most first parties that actually ship games regularly.<p>So the only chance for Wii U to get more exclusives than PS4 is for Nintendo to contract a bunch of 2nd parties and/or sign a lot of exclusive contracts with the 3d parties.

It&#x27;s called the &quot;base rate fallacy.&quot; Suppose you have a test that&#x27;s 90% accurate in identifying both sociopaths and non-sociopaths. If you assume that 4% of people are sociopaths, then the chance of someone who tests positive actually being a sociopath is 26%. (For every thousand people tested, 90% of the 40 sociopaths will test positive, but so will 10% of the 960 non-sociopaths.) You have postulate a test with an amazing 99% accuracy -- only a 1% false positive rate -- even to have an 80% chance of someone testing positive actually being a sociopath.<p>Interestingly here he uses percentages to describe base rates and risk.  Gerd Gigerenzer has a nice book, <i>Reckoning with Risk</i>, where he explains with many examples the problems of this approach.  Gerd asks people to use real numbers instead, which are much easier to understand for most people.<p>Thus, Schneier&#x27;s example becomes:<p>> <i>Out of 1,000 people about 40 of will be sociopaths.  You have a test that will tell you if someone is, or is not, a sociopath.  The test will be correct 9 times out of 10.  Bob has taken the test, and has been identified as a possible sociopath.  The chance that Bob is actually a sociopath are actually about 1 in 4.  This is because the test will tell you that 36 of the 40 sociopaths are sociopaths, but it will also incorrectly tell you that 96 non-sociopaths are sociopaths.</i><p>My writing is lousy, and other people will be able to clean this up, but even with my poor writing style it&#x27;s easier for most people to follow and understand than the percentages.<p>This is alarmingly important when you&#x27;re making a health decision - &quot;Should I remove my breasts to reduce my risk of breast cancer?&quot; for example.<p>(<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Reckoning-Risk-Learning-Live-Uncertainty/dp/0140297863"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Reckoning-Risk-Learning-Live-Uncertain...</a>)<p>EDIT: I use &quot;sociopath&quot; because it&#x27;s in the source article.

Their current success is not because of their position in the computer market, but because of their current position in the MP3-Player (iPod) and smartphone markets.<p>And second, because Nokia is not betting on their own OS (as Apple did), but in someone else&#x27;s OS. That means a different kind of pressure from their investors, and a real submission to another company. And they put all their eggs in the same basket. They did that in order to have something really different to offer (they were afraid to compete without a real differentiating element, and not just a different launcher). But that strategy is not working and Microsoft is trying really hard to get other brands to use their OS.<p>So, if MS is not putting all their eggs in the same basket, why should Nokia do it anyway? Just staying on the same road, knowing that there&#x27;s a cliff ahead, in hopes that something will happen... may not be the best strategy. Even if they really believe that Windows Phone is the future, they could use another line of smartphones, with a different OS (even using stock Android could be considered a differentiating element...) just to get some cash that gives them some air (especially from their investors).",1371716296

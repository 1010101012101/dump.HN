He's a smart kid, hopefully, he has a shell to protect against such silly demeaning posts like this...<p>Lots of startups end up going nowhere, it takes more than brains and ingenuity, a bit of luck and fortunate timing also comes into play...<p>Still, Aaron has had a heck of career already -- hell, I didn't even graduate from college until I was 23 (of course at that time, the PC was just a toy, and most Americans did own one, and programmers mostly worked on 24x80 green screen terminals in that day...), yet he reached the pinnacle for a programmer...",1195159467

e-despair (e-spair?)<p>It might even be applied in initially unanticipated ways.  E.g. e-lag (a takeoff of jet-lag):  That tired, time-shifted feeling you get from 2 am ""global"" meetings, without the necessity of actually getting on a plane.<p>It also can be taken to refer to things electronic, in general.  Thus it might well be retroactively applied to activities such as programming the VCR clock, and the like.<p>Whatever the phrase that sticks, an important component will be its easy pronunciation.  ""Road rage"", ""jet-lag"".  Simple and with preferred syllabic structure.  For more on that, google some of Theo Vennemann's (linguist) work on optimal syllabic structures (I assume its out there somewhere).",1195158712

Everybody reads him.<p>It's pretty clear that a is more damaging. Even if it goes out to fewer people. It is fallacious to reason that it's not so bad because it is hurting one person rather than many. On the one hand generality dilutes criticism. On the other the effects of libel can be greatly non-linear in who reads them, and when.",1195158572

Here and on Reddit people have objected to me signing my messages (which is odd because for _years_ I signed like that on /. without a peep) without any real justification.<p>Your argument that I'm wasting vertical space makes a lot of sense, especially given the clean look of reddit/news.yc compared with /.<p>From now on I'll stop signing.",1195158142

You should also realize that nothing is more valuable than your time, so the sooner you can let it go the more time you have wasted on it, and the less of a failure it will be.<p>Mark Cuban said it once, that you only have to be right in your life once and thats it, it is irrelevant how many times you have failed before it.

Both, I think.<p>At one point:<p>""The kinds of programs American and others are installing are neither terribly expensive nor ""a great leap"" in technology, and thus could have been in place years earlier,""<p>Then, 6 paragraphs later:<p>""And as American was preparing to make big investments in computers, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, occurred, and sent the airline industry into a deep decline.""<p>Huh?  Why the need for ""big investments"" if the solutions are not ""terribly expensive""?<p>This is not a programming problem.  Not even a business problem.  It's a MANAGEMENT problem.  Stop looking at your portfolios long enough to decide that you want something and what you want and WE WILL BUILD IT FOR YOU.<p>Maybe that's why so much energy is going into Web 2.0, social networks, etc.  Because big business is either too dumb or too lazy to articulate their business problems well enough to get a solution.<p>Hell, input this problem into a Y Combinator start-up in January and get a solution in March.<p>See how easy?<p><p>",1195157319

You can also track estimate error over time and use that to adjust future estimates.<p>> <i>The elephant in the room: Debugging. I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve been asked, &quot;When are you going to find that bug?&quot;</i><p>The problem is that in any sample of n=1, variability is huge. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;I am going to pick one person out of the global population. How tall is he or she?&quot;<p>Well of course I can&#x27;t know that. The sample is too small. But if instead I am told &quot;we are going to pick ten thousand people at random from the global population; how tall are they in total?&quot; then I can use previously-gathered statistics to give a range of estimates that will probably be accurate.",1379289591

6390847,comment,6389498,6390715,3,0,rmk2,,,"Why do we need to bother with repeatable experiments for social sciences? You&#x27;ve read Heidegger, it seems (&quot;who is fucking brilliant if you can get through his ridiculous prose&quot;). We are already <i>geworfen</i> into this world, a world that consists of <i>Mitsein</i>. This is your own <i>Dasein</i>, which is a fact, because it is the apriori of your <i>Sein</i> and first enables you to ask any of the questions you ask. Heidegger sees ontology as more fundamental, more basic than any of the sciences, because they only describe the <i>Wie</i> of <i>Dasein</i>, not <i>Sein</i> itself. We don&#x27;t &quot;need to have a fucking clue&quot; why things happen, because we are already involved in them either way. If you indeed subscribe to Heidegger, then none of these questions are primary questions, they are questions that you can only concern yourself with after you have understood the conditions and structures of your own <i>Sein</i>. There is a good reason <i>Sein und Zeit</i> is a fragment, an aborted solution for the problem of ontology. Heidegger himself notices that his line of enquiry does not solve the overall problem of ontology, despite his optimistic start. Perhaps therein lies part of the reason why ontology has been seen rather sceptically by many of the people who followed him?",1379289532

6390835,comment,6390458,6390458,5,0,mistercow,,,"This sounds pretty neat; a handful of modest little adjustments that could prevent a lot of headaches. Being able to instantly take Colemak with me to any computer would be amazing (although carrying a keyboard around everywhere I use a computer sounds iffy).<p>Now I&#x27;ve said some positive things, so I&#x27;m going to nitpick. This is HN, after all.<p>The first thing that stands out to me is that it doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot of attention has been paid to ergonomic details. The lowest hanging fruit here, which I&#x27;ve never seen in any keyboard, is to put feet on the side <i>toward</i> the user. In almost all cases, the way I&#x27;ve seen people&#x27;s desks set up is such that there is no way for them to have a neutral wrist position (wrists not bending up). Worse yet, keyboards invariably have those little feet on the back, and people assume they should use them, which causes them to bend their wrists up even more. Ideally, a keyboard would let you fine tune its slope so that you can set it up exactly to your needs, although I have no idea how you would build that conveniently.<p>The second nitpick is with something Atwood says on the linked page:<p>> Nothing lets you get your thoughts out of your brain and into words faster and more efficiently than a well made keyboard.<p>Technically that is true, in the sense that a stenotype is technically a keyboard. But the reason I&#x27;m picking this nit is that as someone who has made it a side quest to find <i>something</i> better than a standard computer keyboard, this is a bit of a sore spot for me. The <i>minimum</i> you have to be able manage on a stenotype to be a court reporter is 225 wpm for live testimony. That&#x27;s a $50k/year job where a <i>requirement</i> is typing faster than the all time world record for a typewriter-style keyboard.<p>That&#x27;s a phonetic system, and it&#x27;s not immediately obvious how to untangle all of the issues with making it work with programming. On the other hand, there&#x27;s Veyboard, which is non-phonetic and more flexible, and seems like it could be used for programming in its current state. It&#x27;s slower than stenotype, but far faster than a traditional keyboard.<p>My point is that it irks me that we have so many people typing so much and getting injured, and not much focus seems to be going into adopting a better, radically different approach. We have a handful of very expensive hardware options intended for specialized markets, and we have Plover[1] (nothing similar exists that I know of for emulating a Veyboard), and that&#x27;s about it. And on the mass market side, we have less expensive, specially designed ergonomic traditional keyboards based mostly on shakily researched principles.<p>Would it necessarily help with RSI just to increase typing speed? That needs to be tested. But it seems likely that if you reduce the amount of time spent typing, you&#x27;ll reduce the amount of damage.<p>[1]<a href=""http://plover.stenoknight.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plover.stenoknight.com/</a>",1379289392
6390834,comment,6388634,6390282,1,0,jacques_chester,,,"> <i>I usually estimate that writing the code is anywhere from 10-20% of completing the project.</i><p>McConnell&#x27;s book has a really excellent table of items that are left out of estimates. Nuts-and-bolts things like &quot;API documentation&quot;, &quot;deployment scripts&quot;, &quot;status emails&quot; and so on.<p>> <i>This still leaves a lot of bugs.</i><p>Right. The classical software engineering theory is to build multiple quality gates and to study them for defects yielded.

The cash flows involved in an OTC derivative are explicitly stated in the contract itself.<p><i>I imagine that the complicitness of the rating agencies in the whole thing never would have even gotten so egregious if most institutions had vanilla instruments on their books that were straight forward to value. OTC derivatives made it very easy to hide finagling...</i><p>You imagine incorrectly. Pricing most of these contracts is 8&#x27;th grade math given a specific scenario - fancy math comes into play only in estimating the probabilities of each scenario. In principle, the pricing formula is this:<p><pre><code>    price = P(housing goes down) x BIG LOSS + P(housing goes up) x MODERATE GAIN
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s the price, regardless of whether it&#x27;s a straightforward vanilla mortgage or a fancy synthetic CDO.
The ratings agencies, banks and government all assigned a very low value to P(housing goes down). Using vanilla instruments doesn&#x27;t change this basic calculation.",1379289365

Ask me to build something as a whole, don&#x27;t ask me to solve mathematics questions and other unrealistic junk questions.<p>Without the math, how do you know that your solutions are any good? How do you know that the algorithm you sketched out on the whiteboard will work on the 1,000,000 records that we have in production in addition to the 5 record toy example that you worked out?<p>I mean, sure, I agree that brainteasers are in appropriate. Knowing why manhole covers are round or how M&Ms get their candy shell tells me nothing about your programming ability. But basic math and algorithms? They&#x27;re a lot more important than you think. Knowing Big-O notation, various kinds of basic algorithms and a good assortment of data structures lets me know that you can evaluate a solution and find potential flaws and bugs.<p><i>How is putting someone on the spot to build something and build it perfect a good test of their capabilities and skills?</i><p>There&#x27;s a difference between perfect and working. I&#x27;ve never had an interviewer ask me for perfect code. Not at Amazon. Not at Google. Not at Facebook. I have, however, been asked for working code. The code doesn&#x27;t need to be 100% bug free, but it should be syntactically correct and should solve the problem in a reasonable fashion (e.g. without using inordinate time or space).<p>Frankly, I like technical interviews a lot more than the alternative, which increasingly boils down to, &quot;Make me a webapp and we&#x27;ll evaluate your code.&quot; I&#x27;m sorry, but if I wanted to make a webapp for you on my own time, I also want to get paid for it.

6390797,comment,6389294,6389294,11,0,tokenadult,,,"&quot;So Zambia is not failed. It is simply very, very poor. Sixty-four percent of the population lives on less than $1 per day&quot;<p>And that is the key fact. Many of the comments in this thread are not specific to Zambia. There was a time when Zambia looked like a success story among African countries, as the first national leader after independence seemed more democratically minded and less corrupt than many leaders in Africa. The year Zambia became independent, I have read, it was wealthier than Taiwan--where my wife was living at the time. Zambia was neither unusually poor nor unusually badly governed among countries of the world when it gained independence.<p>So the key question in looking at international examples of national development is to slog through the process of John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;method of agreement and difference&quot;[1] and figure out what commonalities help countries develop and prosper, and what commonalities drag down the fortunes of the inhabitants of a country. &quot;Ninety-four percent of the land in Zambia is customary or traditional, no one has a title to it. Its not just sitting there, people are living on it, farming, grazing animals, its just technically under the control of a chief.&quot; That jumps out at me as a huge difference between Zambia and many countries that have developed more successfully--clear land title that can be readily transferred for money. Taiwan makes better use of its land, and developed better, I hypothesis, in part because it is clear who owns what land and who has rights in land. (There was land reform for poor peasants, making them landowners, in Taiwan in the 1950s. Then the economic development began there.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill&#x27;s_Methods#Joint_method_of_agreement_and_difference"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill&#x27;s_Methods#Joint_method_of...</a><p>AFTER EDIT: I posted hurriedly at first, having an appointment to get to. One other point, which generalizes to more parts of Africa and more parts of east Asia, is that for a given level of educational spending, many east Asian countries invested mostly in good-quality primary education for the masses, while many African countries set up a national university available only to an elite minority of the population. (And often enough, the national university graduates from African countries became part of the &quot;brain drain&quot; to other countries.) Raising the skill level of the masses diversifies the economy and makes even countries with very limited natural resources--of which Japan and Taiwan are noteworthy examples--able to develop through trade and transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy and then to a postindustrial economy. Few African countries have pursued a national education policy of broad primary education, those that have are among the African countries that are faring best.",1379288506

Both position you in a certain mode towards your surrounding environment, be it political, social or scientific. They both open certain modes of enquiry while excluding others. One conclusion that one can draw from deconstruction (if we &quot;apply&quot; it onto itself) is that no answer one can ever give will be without bias or will completely exclude any other option.<p>Jrgen Habermas coined, in his Systemtheorie, the notion of the nth grade observer, where every degree of observer may observe another onlooker <i>and</i> his specific bias and blind spot, yet each degree of observation always introduces its own, new blind spot.<p>When Derrida talks about archi-criture, what he says is that if there was ever an all-encompassing entirety of meaning that only had one singly way of interpretation, then this unity is a mythical one which cannot be recovered. Every utterance, every decision has the inherent option of an opposition.<p>Derrida is Hegel upside down. If Hegel sees Geist as the unity of matter and spirit, then for Derrida, this unity might have existed in an archaic past but has since been lost and cannot be put back together. Hence, whatever we do will not empty out all possible interpretations and views of life, there will be no single answer to the meaning of life or some such. Instead, all that remains is the fundamental idea that every utterance and every positions carries within itself already the means to disprove it.<p>This is <i>not</i> fundamentally different to the scientific method. The atom was thought to be the smallest, inseperable unit (hence the name) before it could be found. However, in finding the atom, we realised that it is, indeed, made up of smaller parts, which in turn are again made up of smaller parts. What was taken as an absolute minimum was, in fact, only the temporary minimum before we could conceive smaller units. The same, just in reverse, goes for the solar system, galaxies etc.",1379288050

Many of them fell into what they did based on their connections (which all the schools mentioned provide, no doubt), including myself, at times.  Based off resumes I&#x27;ve seen, particularly for technical marketing type roles (which I&#x27;ve seen more of, so I can comment about that), the internships don&#x27;t seem to fully provide a good glimpse of what they know (and can vary hugely), or if they fully understand what goes on in these positions.  Further, internships up until recently mattered very little - as the school could provide connections.<p>Weirdly, I don&#x27;t blame the school at all.  I&#x27;m more appalled that they admitted to me at graduation that I should take an unpaid internship (height of the recession) because they figured that most students could afford to effectively work their first jobs unpaid to get skills for jobs they don&#x27;t know how to connect people to.  This is not going to change until they get more alumni with a wider range skills, so, hence, above.<p>TL:DR Schools are doing this because up until now they could send their kids into jobs. Now well-paid careers are shifting, and they can&#x27;t.  This matches up with the rise of internships and stories like these.  Meh.",1379287533

As you continue to estimate, you create and refine a mental model of the project&#x27;s complexity. For some projects, you&#x27;re able to create a mental model that has high fidelity quite easily. For others, it takes a bit of work. The entire article here was an exposition on this fact.<p>Some folks figure that out and want to just give up. Estimation is impossible! Other folks, however, are going to figure it out if it kills them. What happens in these cases is they start to list every possible variable that could be involved in such a model in every scenario, and then create one uber, ultimate, super model that works in all situations.<p>Over time and through lots of trial and error, both approaches have been found to be bullshit. Instead of giving up, or creating more and more complex models that take more and more time to work, with each project you&#x27;re better off starting with the most ludicrously simple model you can and then adding complexity as needed. The trick is incremental complexity, repetition, and convergence. If you have that nailed, the details of your actual model, oddly enough, do not matter that much.<p>Obligatory link to previous comment: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6389227"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6389227</a>",1379287064

6390667,comment,6390437,6390437,4,0,rquantz,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking about what should replace Wordpress in the CMS space (as opposed to blogging). There are a lot of aspects of Wordpress that make it great, and a lot of things that make it absolutely terrible. I think part of its problem is that it seems intended to be a platform that non-developers can maintain themselves, while presenting features that really require a developer. As a result, it is not a suitable environment either for non-coders or coders.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a platform that is easily deployed on shared hosting (written in php, using mysql) but that lends itself better to version control and switching environments. It should keep configuration in plain text instead of in the database, and it should allow easy definition of node types in addition to the standards (post, page, comment, etc.). These should also be defined in plain text instead of in the database (I&#x27;m looking at you, Drupal). Meanwhile, theming should be just as easy as with Wordpress.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s good to see others trying to enter the blogging platform space and compete with Wordpress, but I really want to see a truly good CMS come along.",1379286061

4488011,comment,4483554,4486464,1,0,jcr,,,"Yep, you're right; a net with mixed public/private addresses can
certainly work well when done correctly. Unfortunately, it can also
<i>seem</i> to work for some period of time when done incorrectly. The
trouble is, most people don't grasp the ramifications of doing it wrong.
I'm sure you understand the ramifications at least as well as I do, and
probably a whole lot better, but for the sake of everyone else in the
room...<p>When a network/ISP misuses unallocated address space by routing
the traffic to something internal, this prevents the inside of the
network/ISP from reaching those addresses normally. Unallocated address
space can be allocated by the RIR's at any time, so misuse of
unallocated address space results in parts of the Internet unreachable.<p>If some huge networks/ISP's (Comcast, Verizon, Sprint, ...) decided to
misuse the address block allocated to you for some internal purpose,
you'd be rightfully upset since it would prevent all users of those
ISP's from reaching your service/servers. Now let's assume you're a new
company and just got a new allocation of addresses from the RIR only to
find out the users of major ISP's can't reach your service because the
ISP's have already misused <i>your</i> address block for something internal
on their networks. Yep, you'd be livid, and livid with good reason.<p>If you put a lot of work into your misuse of unallocated address space,
all that effort could turn out to be wasted a few hours later when the
block you misused gets allocated. To reach the newly allocated block,
you'd need to redo all that work over again, correctly.",1347003865

Languages like PHP, Perl and JavaScript do not particularly care about that distinction, and therefore coding values consistently is hard in those languages.  (You can guess, but sometimes guess wrong - your zip codes are usually represented as numbers and sometimes strings.)  Languages like Ruby and Python do care about the distinction, and so applications can have difficulty accepting JSON from the previous languages.<p>This new format allows more places for this kind of issue to exist.  We have distinction between different types of integers.  We have symbols (2 kinds if you have them).  We have sets.  We have 2 different kinds of lists.  And we have a plethora of possible extensions, every one of which can behave differently in different implementations.<p>When both sides speak Clojure, this is going to be a very convenient choice.  When they don't, every one of these obvious features is going to be a source of headaches down the road.<p>That is why data exchange formats should be in a least common denominator between the languages in question.",1347002814

4487956,comment,4486175,4487343,3,0,fdr,,,"I agree with you. I'd like to expand a little:<p>The main people who can get a benefit from database independence are those who ship software to a client site to be executed.  Imagine if you wrote some kind of accounting software package that you handed off to a corporation's IT group to manage: supporting more databases is probably more important than supporting more operating systems (mostly because the number of OSes requiring support has collapsed for most new applications).  There will be installations running on different databases all the time.<p>The second most beneficial effect is if you are planning to change databases frequently (why?).  Personally I don't think this is usually worth it for technical reasons, you may as well accept it'll suck when it comes time to do this and take whatever shortcuts make life easier and more correct before that.  However, it can be useful as a hedge against your database management system vendor trying to play the role of an extortionate gangster or, alternatively, lying down and dying.<p>One thing I like about Postgres is that it is a project, and not a product.  There is no overarching database vendor to extort you or die off suddenly:  project death is conditional on a lack of interest -- both financial and personal -- in the project's maintenance and improvement.  Truly, it will have to be completely obsolete in the marketplace to die.  PGCon getting hit by a meteor would be a major setback, though.<p>The downside is that a project can't often make strategic or speculative investments in whizbang features: there has to be some gestalt agreement that a new feature is both worthwhile and implemented very well (both in terms of correctness and maintainability: the odds of you being able to ask another programmer in real time what is going on in a module are very low), and that means quite a bit of humming and hawing before committing to a feature or approach.<p>It's not for everyone: some whizbang feature other may enable your business grow fast enough and survive long enough to deal with the potential pitfalls of having a potentially extortionate or dead database vendor (the old generation: the usual proprietary-RDBMS suspects.  Probably the new generation: database-implementation-by-wire <i>only</i>).  But it's something to put on the scales, at least.",1347002443

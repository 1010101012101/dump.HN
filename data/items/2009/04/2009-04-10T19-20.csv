556697,comment,556230,556611,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Nobody is saying that government isn't good at some things that the private sector is not good at. You are changing the argument. Your statement was that we owe the government ""A Good Chunk"" for some ""things"" that cause people to be rich. All of these things were ""built on the backs of people paying significantly higher taxes than our selfish generation pays today"" I pointed out that your examples are examples of private sector and government cooperation at best, and government mucking around at worst.<p>The private sector is NOT good at some things. Point taken and agreed. However, we have rich people and private sector profitable work all over the globe, in all sorts of governmental conditions. We have businesses that operate without roads or electricity, businesses that work under onerous governmental regulations and no regulations at all. Your thesis -- that rich folks owe the government ""a good chunk"" is not supported by your examples. Furthermore, countless counter-examples exist. You just can't wave your arms around and say ""infrastructure"" a bunch of times and make an argument. Infrastructure is not a prerequisite for people to get rich. Even if it was, people should not be indebted to nations for things that their great grandparents did -- the social contract is about here and now, not 50 years ago. Rich people are in no way morally indebted, at least as far as I can tell.<p>Your case is thus: Infrastructure helps people get rich. Rich people live in a environment with infrastructure. The government is the sole provider of said infrastructure. Therefore, rich people owe the government more.<p>If I'm not understanding please correct me, but you're not making any sense at all to me. It sounds like just a slogan you're repeating over and over. I'm going to bow out unless you have something truly useful. It's beginning to sound like we're talking past each other.",1239393555

556694,comment,556230,556610,0,0,robotrout,,,"> I don't think we should be making decisions based on principle; we should make them based on data.<p>I'm very sorry that you feel that data always trumps principle.  I suspect if I changed the conversation to eugenics or honesty, you would claim that principle is more important than data.<p>In fact, principle is an overriding concern with you, despite your protestations to the contrary.  I wonder if I could ever get you to acknowledge that fact?  Look at what you said.<p>> not dumb things (resource wars, policing of victimless hobbies, ""too big to fail"" bailouts)<p>All three of these things have substantial data to show why they are important.  If you think that resources are not worth going to war for, than you have no idea what any war in the history of mankind has been about.  Resources are the only thing worth fighting for, and indeed, are the only thing we do fight for.  As for victimless hobbies, I assume you mean drugs.  There's a lot of data that says it's harmful.  How many meth users do you know?  I know some.  I agree that drugs should not be illegal, but I do that based on my principles of freedom, not data.  The data actually supports the status quo.  As for the ""too big to fail"" bailouts, I'm told there is substantial data on this as well, but again, in principle, I'd still let them fail.<p>Your blanket statements prove that principle is more important to you than data.  Principles are important, and as much as you claim otherwise, you and I are in the same camp on that one.",1239393501

556682,comment,556230,556558,0,0,glymor,,,"<i>First, they disagree about who precisely ""the rich"" that the motion refers to are. Mr Piketty defines them as the very, very rich: the top 1% or perhaps 0.5% of the income distribution. Mr Edwards, on the other hand, is referring to a broader segment of the population: perhaps the top quintile or quartile.</i><p>How you define ""the rich"" would be a big part of the debate. I would argue that a max rate at 35K is far to low. Most more modern tax systems go up in much smaller steps and max out much higher (Singapore maxes out at ~150,000GBP (20%) for example). Piketty's attempt to define the rich as top 1% isn't borne out in at least the UK's tax code.<p>I was originally making a point that the amount of tax we pay is quite a bit more than the headline rate. A minimum of 52% of everyone's money is going to the government.<p>If people really though about just how much of their money this is and how badly they could do with it they would probably find someone better than ""the rich"" to be angry with.",1239392841

In a lot of cases, employees do not directly see the benefits of their company's success, other than to continue having a job.  The money would seem to directly benefit shareholders, who are largely rich people who decided to ""risk"" buying a piece of a company.<p>Yes, the people who invest <i>should</i> see some of the return.  And yes, the company probably wouldn't exist (along with all its jobs) without these investors.  But the gains from the company are likely only to benefit other rich people, other shareholders.  And investments are going to concentrate on ventures that are <i>likely to be profitable</i>, not in things that are more basic, such as building roads.<p>Tax money tends to favor the stuff like building roads.

It's highly questionable whether any individual is actually worth, say, 100 million a year.  There's virtually always someone who could take their place - if Bill Gates hadn't made his fortune on MS, a different, perfectly adequate OS vendor would have succeeded, and the PC landscape probably wouldn't be so vastly different from what it is today.  Ditto Ellison, etc.  If the individual isn't totally irreplaceable, it's a bit hard to justify their having the income of 2000 average households - so it's fair to tax that income as a correction of the unfair inequalities that a capitalist system naturally leads to.  The truly irreplaceable people - the once in a generation brilliant minds - tend not to be vastly wealthy anyway.<p>A further point is that few people become entrepreneurs in order to become stellar-level rich.  Sure, they want to be wealthy, and I think we all know that a tax system that discourages people from wanting to become millionaires is a mistake, but it's unlikely that massive taxes on people earning more than 50 million a year is going to discourage entrepreneurship.<p>I'm not, however, arguing that a 90% tax rate is necessarily <i>sensible</i>.

After all, if not to share their wisdom so that it need not be rediscovered, what is a teacher there for?<p>But this is ultimately misguided: there's no way to cut out or even accelerate the process of digesting years worth of experience into ""wisdom,"" and efforts to do so merely cause confusion for the student.<p>We see this again and again: math PhDs interested in ""new""-ing up elementary math education think that concepts like the commutative, distributive, and associative properties would be <i>great</i> to sneak in to the curriculum, because it would give kids an early glimpse of what's so exciting about math, and it might even get them thinking abstractly early on!  But the fact is, even for those of us that eventually go on to discover how exciting the more abstract stuff is, those lessons in our youth were entirely wasted, as we weren't ready to see the point yet (there's evidence that in that particular example there's even a brain development constraint that ensures children won't learn much in that way, but IMO this applies even in the absence of such constraints).  Frankly, I had very little use for the concepts until I was well underway in a math major myself, and by that point I would have discovered them anyways as I needed them; the early exposure did not help one bit.<p>The real problem: most teachers don't understand what the true goal of teaching should be.  Hint: it's not about shoveling expertise into students heads.<p>A great teacher has a unique gift, able to lead students quickly through the example phase and build naturally up to the point where high level concepts may be used to construct new examples, allowing the process to continue.  A poor teacher is often poor precisely because they understand the high level too well, and they become unable to remember a productive path through those lower levels.  Instead of leading students through an optimized sequence where material is presented at every point so that it maximizes learning speed locally, they mistakenly think that the concepts that help most at the expert level should be digested early.<p>As a concrete example, my first intro to programming class, which was theoretically for people that had never programmed in their lives, began with a discussion on the finer points of malloc.  The teacher actually coded a basic implementation on the blackboard, thinking that was something we absolutely needed to see in our <i>first programming class</i>, ever!  After which we were put in a computer lab to code, having been instructed that in this class the only editor we would use would be vi, because it's great, and oh yeah, here's a list of the most powerful commands, learn to use them or Fail.  There <i>will</i> be a test.  Needless to say, I learned very little from that teacher, though I have no doubt he was a true expert in his field.<p>For a good example, read just about anything by (obviously) Feynman.<p>There are very few good teachers in this world.  I suspect that the few students that successfully gain significant amounts of knowledge from school and books generally do so more because they have learned to disregard what the teacher thinks is important and focus on what <i>they</i> need in order to learn, whereas other students get frustrated when they don't ""get it.""",1239390113

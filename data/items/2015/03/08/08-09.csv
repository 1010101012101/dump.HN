I jokingly asked, &quot;What, double your bet when you lose?&quot;. He replied—in all seriousness—&quot;No, <i>triple</i> it!&quot;<p>I then argued with him about the money he would likely lose implementing his plan. He said, &quot;what are the odds the ball will land on red five times in a row?&quot;. (We were ignoring the existence of the green 0 and 00). I took out a quarter, flipped it <i>seven</i> times, and it landed heads every time. This happened straight-away.<p>That was a random sequence, it was all 0s, and I&#x27;d like to think he was lucky that it happened that way, and convinced him to abandon his plan.<p>But I was also lucky. I had intended to demonstrate this, and was prepared to be flipping the coin hundreds of times until the run of 0s came up. You could say I was predicting the next result correctly 100% of the time on those first 7 flips. But my ability to predict the results didn&#x27;t show their non-randomness, instead it showed my &quot;luckiness&quot;. Which really means they weren&#x27;t predictions at all, I guess.",1425805064

I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to run into people who for the most part, appreciate and can vouch for my knowledge. Heck, even people who after interviewing me, took a chance and convinced skeptics to give me a chance.<p>I won&#x27;t say I was never rejected by a company simply because I do not possess a degree, but it has never really bothered me. I&#x27;ve worked with many great companies and teams on many great projects and if those other doors didn&#x27;t close for me, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have had the opportunities I had.<p>Something I&#x27;ve noticed though: To many, a degree is a sign of being able to commit and follow through with something. The lack of a degree, especially for someone as young as myself, is disconcerting/a red flag to many. And that&#x27;s perfectly fine, I get the concerns. Not everyone will take the time or effort to understand why you never got a degree (financial difficulties or otherwise), they may just write you off.<p>That being said, I do recommend anyone who is blessed with the opportunity, to go and finish a degree. I&#x27;ve seen firsthand the connections some prestigious programs provide that I was never able to get, and most importantly, many people simply do not have the discipline to delve deep into the various areas necessary to allow you to be successful in this field. There&#x27;s no doubt it&#x27;s tiring and it&#x27;s definitely no easier than following a set curriculum.",1425804908

9165019,comment,9163782,9164976,0,0,raverbashing,,,"Some simple explanation<p>Compression exploits redundancy in a data stream (basically). You basically get &quot;all symbols&quot; (and how you define this varies according to your compression method: you could do all letters in the case of text, or even text snippets that repeat, etc) and reassemble them in a way that the ones that repeat the most take less space (and you also need to start from a basic dictionary known by all uncompressors or ship it with your compressed file)<p>One simple analogy is writing with abbreviations, but if you write e.g. the reader has to know what &quot;e.g.&quot; means or you have to put in the beginning &quot;e.g. = example&quot; (and this also takes space)<p>Now, a randomly generated file ideally has all symbols repeating with the same frequency, (we say all symbols have the same entropy - I&#x27;m not sure about this exact wording), hence you can&#x27;t take a symbol that repeats more or less and make it take less space in your compressed file",1425803649

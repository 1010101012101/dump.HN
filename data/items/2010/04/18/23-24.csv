Going to grad school next year, I wanted something portable, and hoped to buy the 13"" the second they gave the line a performance boost. Unfortunately, they skipped over it, and I decided to go with the 15"" for the i5. Sure, the Core 2 Duo would have been sufficient for most of my needs, but I play in Photoshop/Logic Pro quite a bit, and knowing that apps like these and more will soon be optimized to take advantage of the threading capabilities, I felt going with the 13"" would put me at a long term disadvantage. I guess I sacrificed the portability for what is, to me, a better long term investment. The bigger screen isn't so bad either, although, the new 15""s tend to have a bit more fat around the edges than their PowerBook predecessors.",1271635024

And a lot of granola for snacks.  And chips.<p>Then I found out about the caloric cost of these things.  Holy shit. (Well, the chips were not a surprise.)<p>I was quite sad (did I mention I love peanut butter?), but also quite sad that my weight was slowly creeping up, past 200 lbs and then towards 210.  And I saw some pictures of me giving a talk on stage, and cringed. (Big win for vanity, boys and girls. )<p>So I changed what I ate, and started going out running.  Over about 4 or 5 months  got down to 180 lbs (and greatly increased my endurance and improved my heart rate).  Then the weather got too cool for my wussy ass, and I wasn't feeling well, and excuses, excuses.<p>Now it's been about 3 months since I did any real exercise (aside from occasional walks around the block), yet my weight has stayed at least constant, though it may be dipping lower.<p>The combination of exercise and diet change did wonders, but I believe that diet change alone would still have brought the weight down, albeit more slowly.<p>I'm still amazed that when I weigh myself I never go above 180.

If you have any obligations (working married father of 2 here), it is darned hard to modify my schedule to include significantly more exercise.  However my life follows a routine.  It wasn't hard for me a few years ago to drop my soda habit, cut out my afternoon snack, and drop my dinner down to a 6"" sandwich.<p>Based on my experience, the problem with your theory is simple.  Weight gain and loss is not a matter of will power.  If you approach it that way then you need to maintain the thought in front of your head and focus to an extent that we find hard.  It is a question of habits.  And that makes it a question of what routines are easiest to stick into our lives.  For me, dropping unnecessary eating sessions, and reducing what I ate at others, was a lot easier than finding a lot of time for exercise.<p>(Now in fact I added 15 minutes/day of exercise and kept it up for several years.

1275697,comment,1275514,1275659,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think that ""Overridable semicolon"" captures most of what a monad is and why you'd want to use it.  Imagine that the compiler provided a hook into the language so that you could pass around statements (the monad type), a means to convert an expression to a statement (return), and the semicolon operator that combines two statements (>>=).  And then instead of implicitly letting you do anything in a statement, it required that you explicitly program the effects of that statement into the semicolon operator.<p>The simplest possible semicolon is one that lets you do anything, including interact with the outside environment.  That's the IO monad.  But you could also have a semicolon that limits your side-effects to one particular area of memory - that's the State monad.  Or you could have one that doesn't execute any of the following statements if an error occurs - that's an exception monad.  Or you could have one that attempts to <i>atomically</i> execute a bunch of statements that may read & write from a block of memory, but if that memory is changed by another thread, the effects are all rolled back and tried again.  That's the STM (software transactional memory) approach to concurrency.  Or you could have one that sends a webpage to the user's browser with an HTML representation of the state, waits for a response, and then executes the rest of the statements.  That's the approach taken by WASH, one of the Haskell web frameworks.<p>It's a powerful tool, because it's basically rewriting the fundamentals of how the language works.  And because of that, very few people ever have a reason to create a new monad type, which is why examples tend to fall flat.  It also interacts heavily with other Haskell features, eg. you don't get this correspondence between monads and statements without Haskell's do-notation, and you can't use them to affect control flow without lazy evaluation, and they become very difficult to reason about without a static type system.",1271633712

Sure you get feature bloat because the intersection of what I do 80% and what you do 80% is not really that big, and you get quality control issues that you have to fix in later versions. But you cast a huge net and catch lots of fish that way even if some occasionally slip through the holes in the net.<p>Contrast this with Apple's ""insanely great"". You make a product, and polish it to a ridiculous shine. Sure you might alienate users who need it to do X when you've spent a great deal of time making sure it does Y better than anybody else, but the people that need to do Y will love you for all time. You may not cast a huge net, because instead of manufacturing lots of low quality net, you manufactured a small amount of very high quality net, but you catch fish that nobody else can get because they break through everybody else's net.<p>What happened with Word Perfect, by way of example, is that they just never bothered. They had their cash cow and figured they had locked in users because of their fancy keyboard shortcuts. They already had achieved ""good enough"" and didn't know how to compete against another vendors seeking that same quality. If Microsoft had been going for an Apple like ""insanely great"" quality, they would have made a completely different target. When Microsoft focused on perfecting Y, Word Perfect could have focused on X and Z and still made it. But instead, Microsoft did X Y and Z ""good enough"" that there really wasn't any difference between the products. And then Microsoft had a whole integrated suite of ""good enoughs"" and Word Perfect went quietly away.",1271632026

We have multiple other languages that can be used as a good way to access the goodies provided by your wonderful hand-crafted libraries regardless of what they do. There is no reason for you to invent your own language just so people will be able to use your library code from a REPL.<p>Sadly, back in the dark ages, this was not true. However, in the future, anyone who tries to defend the horrible design of a new language with ""Think of it as a DSL"" gets to debug a 1000 KLOC application written in ANS COBOL 1968, which is a DSL for fixed-field database munging.",1271631967

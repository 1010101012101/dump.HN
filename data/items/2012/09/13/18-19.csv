I'll just say that there's a huge difference between ""Research & Development"" and only ""Development"".  The first is far more time consuming, risky and expensive.  The second is a clear and guided roadmap that you simply follow to completion.<p>I used to be an idealist.  I bought the whole idea of ""just build a better product"" without question.  And so I did.  Many years ago I embarked in the development of electronic products for a specific industry while trenching new territory and bringing new ideas to the user base.  I opted not to file for patents because, well, they were expensive and I was going to just beat them with a better product.  Or so I thought.<p>The first product took about a year and a half in R&D.  Lots of work.  Lots of problems to solve.  Lots to learn.  It finally got out and we did really good business right out of the gate.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars per month.  Eight months later competitors came out with devices offering about 60% of what we were doing at half the price.<p>It nearly killed the business.  A six month month run with a hardware product isn't enough to recoup your R&D.  Our competitors had the advantage of only having to do the ""D"" part because they copied and stole as much as they could.  Never mind the fact that they did not have to trench new territory and actually test to see if there was a market there.<p>The lessons I learned during this period were invaluable (and very painful).  Patents do have reason to exist and should not be ignored.  People will cheat and steal in business the first chance they get.  It takes a special kind of person to honor an agreement without the threat of serious financial harm through litigation if violated.  People will violate NDA's and use them to get your ideas and insight under all kinds of pretenses.<p>Business is war.  I was an idealist.  An idiot.  Live and  learn.<p>I don't know about the Apple vs. Samsung issue.  Frankly, I don't have the time to dive into the details.  Even if it did, it would be a huge waste of my time as I have nothing to gain from such an exercise.  Not taking sides, here's hoping that the courts get it right.",1347562445

But the relative proportion of those two cases is the matter of scientific studies - that's the first method we have to determine that seatbelts help save lives. Another one is a mix of physics and common sense. It's better not to be ejected from your seat at high velocity and fly through glass. In the same way, it's better when the screen does not hit the ground (as rubber cases are bigger than the phone and thus protect from impact) or hits, but with much smaller velocity (as rubber absorbs the energy from collision with the ground).<p>So yes, we can't say much from all the anecdotes here.

If the bar for patent validity is going to be this low, most software developers will not be able to do a day's work without accidentally infringing on something. Every piece of software I've seen being built most certainly uses methods that are described somewhere in patents, especially if it is leading edge in terms of communicating, collecting, syncing or displaying information through the web or mobile devices. If court decisions keep going this way, it is going to become impossible to code legally without the costly burden of acquiring a patent war chest and a team of layers to defend your organisation.

On any given day, you get roughly 50k to 100k new registrations.  99% of those seem to be ad-parked (or whatever the term is (see sexa1.com, registered yesterday -- textually NFSW)) or misconfigured (understandable, I suppose, for a day-old domain).<p>I'm guessing maybe 0.05% (half of that remaing 1%) are sex related: tube, cam, and image porn aggregation; escort sites.<p>I find it truly amazing that so much is built on 3rd party content.  After watching these new domains for so long, I started thinking:  What am I missing?  Can I actually make a little bit of passive income with a $10 domain name and a little forum name-dropping?  The OP seems to think that people can.  Obviously people do.<p>EDIT: I meant to finish with, I wish the article gave some real revenue numbers.

4517672,comment,4517278,4517511,5,0,cooldeal,,,"It's not about the quality per se but I think their problem right now is that users' choice is overwhelming them and the one-size-fits-all approach of the iPhone has diminishing returns after a point. The variety, choice of screen sizes and price ranges of the competition is only getting better by the day.<p>A new iPhone is released only once a year, so it better be very good with a lot of new technologies, features, new designs etc. for sales to last all through the next year. iPhone 4S sales started lagging in the 3Q itself this year, compared to the 4th quarter for the iPhone 4. This is because people start waiting for the next version or switch to the competition because they have better specced devices with more features. I think Samsung timed their Galaxy S3 launch perfectly to coincide with the iPhone 4S getting old enough to beat, and they beat it in monthly sales for the first time, which is a noteworthy thing in itself.<p>The whole situation is reminding me of the PC wars in the 80s, where Apple had a seemingly unassailable  innovation lead, and then squandered it away by offering limited choice and higher prices, while Microsoft very smartly licensed DOS to Compaq and others like Dell and HP, and the rest is history. Apple's marketshare is now 17% vs. Android's 67% which is about 4 times more. No wonder Apple is going crazy with the patent war against Android. That's probably their only weapon against the equivalent of the hordes of the 'beige boxes'.",1347559821

4517667,comment,4502383,4513891,1,0,wam,,,"Hadn't thought about the similarity to file sharing, but it makes sense. Sort of a chaotic neutral in contrast to mass retaliations. Early on with file sharing, I thought that a system might arise where people would voluntarily pay into legal defense or settlement funds for the people randomly targeted by enforcement agencies. A kind of insurance system against the possibility that you might be next. It didn't turn out that way, and in retrospect I think it would mostly have encouraged the RIAA etc to keep pursuing random sharers instead of trying to go after the center of bigger hubs such as megaupload.<p>Back to the point at hand, once again we have a division of culpability, but a little more deliberate in the case of modern filesharing services like megaupload. The systems are legally and technically engineered so that the responsibility for ""unauthorized"" actions rests as much as possible with the distributed mass of uploaders and downloaders, per the provisions of the DMCA (in jurisdictions where it applies). And within that mob the accountability for the sum total of infringement is spread thin. It's an unpalatable choice for the enforcers, I think, with the current tools available to them. Or maybe not, and they just go where the money is.<p>I'm one of those who thinks a good portion of the spectrum of copyright infringement is overblown and outdated. I'm much more concerned about the feedback loop of bad behavior on /b/. But I wouldn't at all want to see Christopher Poole pursued like Kim Dotcom, either.<p>That's the conundrum for me. I'd rather come up with ways to combat the feedback loop during destructive mob events. I think the level of feedback is a function of both moral-alignment and attention-alignment in the mob. I put forward another wordy hypothesis about it elsewhere in the comments here. Attention alignment is somewhat novel because in a physical mob people can't jump out of the situation as easily switching to a different browser tab.<p>I'm sure there are more dimensions to it, but these two seem like possible attack vectors if you want to dissolve an angry distributed mob. But you have to do it in an appropriate and ethical way. The shock-and-awe of the megaupload case is, I think, clearly based on fear, but <i>also</i> an attack against the moral cohesion of the file-sharing mob. They're sort of pushing the guy into the role of criminal, extremist, profiteer.. any of which might resonate with any of us and knock people out of moral alignment with each other. If you make enough peers associate file-sharing with criminality or profiteering, you can shrink the mob.",1347559718

4517663,comment,4517278,4517417,16,0,bane,,,"Looking at the iPhone 5, and when Apple started to go litigation crazy I think a couple factors have combined to force them to go this way.<p>1. The iPhone 5 is an incremental update to the iPhone 4 template. It doesn't mean it's a bad product, it actually looks like it's a very very nice device. But it isn't the leapfrog over the competition that people have come to expect and Apple has built its smartphone business around.<p>I think Apple tends to produce their iDevices at pretty much the absolute state of the art. I think previous smartphones and recent competitors did not because it let them yield better profits given an inefficient supply chain. Now the competition has caught up and is <i>also</i> operating at the state of the art.<p>Now they just produce a very very nice device with specs more or less in-line with the competition. The differentiation is harder to demonstrate.<p>At some point during the development cycle for the iPhone 5 they had to have compared it to the competition in the marketplace and come to the conclusion that it simply isn't going to cut it the way previous phones have. They'll still sell it as an upgrade to most current users, but the rate of new user growth is slowing down and the rate of defectors to the competition is increasing. They must have decided the 5 simply isn't going to do enough on its own as a product to change that.<p>2. In the past year the competition has started to outsell them. Despite having the iPhone available across the major carriers, and having arguably a nicer device at a similar price, it just seems to be an increasingly hard sell. The iPhone 5 <i>may</i> not be enough of a difference from the 4S (in line with consumer expectations) to sway consumers back over into Appleland. Long new product development pipelines have prevented them from pushing out a product that <i>really</i> stands out in a meaningful way in the market anymore.<p>So Apple is hedging, they've calculated that the new iPhone 5 won't swing the pendulum back in their favor, and the only choice is to try and frustrate the ability of the competion in bringing even newer products to market. Apple isn't hoping to make money via the awards, but in swinging the pendulum a few percent back in their favor. It could mean tens of billions on top of the award.",1347559687

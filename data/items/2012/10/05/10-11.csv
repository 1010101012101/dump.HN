Google, Facebook, Apple (iTunes), Amazon, etc. they all have amazingly deep real world data sets just begging for multidimensional analysis.<p>What is close to insane is that practical analysis of big data is not even restricted to these top companies only, as any one of us can set up one own's computing cluster with EC2 and e.g. open-source Weka. I'm sure the next decades will surprise us with many breakthroughs and discussions on data privacy will be moving us closer and closer to total surrender...",1349434777

If I want strong typing I want a system that leverages its power such as Haskell, not something like Java where compilation errors are mostly trivial things and I still end up with null pointers all over the place which is exactly the same as the most common type of error in more powerful dynamic languages.  Beyond that, saying PHP OO is like Java is doing PHP a huge service because Java started out as OO with quite a strong vision.  It may not have been perfect, and it's certainly developed its warts over time, but the seed of conceptual integrity in Java's OO is an order of magnitude more robust than PHP's.<p>> <i>I can't speak for the Ruby side, but on the PHP side you couldn't be more wrong.</i><p>I was specifically making a comparison between PHP and Ruby.  Making a one-side claim is a nonsensical response.",1349434647

Now, it is hard to do this efficiently and it's all very interesting, but are we going to reduce AI to finding a conveniently-tuned input -> output function? This is much closer to simple regression than a thinking brain.<p>Also, this approach is not new but has been around since 1980's. We do have a richer family of models to draw from and a few new tricks, but much of the progress comes primarily from faster computers and infrastructure.<p>The correct article is as follows:\nGoogle is building an amazing piece of infrastructure that allows them to run stochastic gradient descent across many machines very quickly. This engineering feat is particularly convenient for a certain family of models that have been around for the last many years and, as it turns out, scaling up these models actually seems to work well in several common and important scenarios.

For example try to send a thepiratebay.org link to your friends as a private message. Who knows what more they censor, perhaps the really interesting bits to censor seem to you like they have been delivered, but facebook never actually shows it to your firend.

Some business models fail, some prosper.<p>A model, generally speaking, is a lot like a map in that it serves its purpose as being a guide. What do I mean? Let's say I want to travel to France. I can look at a globe and get a pretty good idea of where France is and thus where I need to go. However, once I arrive in France, let's say Paris, that globe is not very useful anymore. I need a more narrow map to help me navigate Paris, so I buy a new map, or rather, I make a new model.<p>Models are meant to help us think about how to navigate a problem, and they change over time because models are not absolute truths. In that sense, since both startups and businesses have business models, perhaps the right logical segmentation is something to the extent that startups are merely a subset of businesses.<p>Then again, none of this really matters.

Personally, I don't think that's ever going to happen, and I don't think it makes any sense either. Apple is trying to become an ever more integrated company, and apparently making their own chip is becoming very important to them. And recent rumors start pointing to the same conclusion, although we probably won't see this happening until 2014:<p><a href=""http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/apple-reportedly-wants-to-ditch-intel-chips-in-macs-hire-its-own-soc-designer-1101772"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/apple-reported...</a><p>From what I hear Haswell will be significantly more expensive than Ivy Bridge, too, so again, to me it looks Intel is becoming less competitive with ARM, not more.

EC2 now has a console that you can use to start and stop services, but there is nothing to help you create a working hosting environment.Creating a robust environment for your needs is likely more trouble than it's worth with EC2.<p>Look into similar services such as Rackspace cloud servers which has similar offerings in a more traditional package.

(We think.) However, it's not so much that I'm concerned with what Google is doing with that information <i>now</i>; I'm concerned with what they <i>might do with it later</i>. Once the data has been collected, it's impossible to ever know for certain that it's been removed. Data collected about customers will survive middle management and CEOs and entire company boards. It may be sold at any time to anyone for any reason -- or given away freely. It may be used for purposes which I am not imaginative enough to conjure up.<p>That probably sounds a little paranoid, but then again, when I was dialing in to eWorld in 1995, I could not have imagined that 17 years later the cable company would be my ISP and they'd be snitching on me if I downloaded unauthorized content. 17 years is not beyond the life time of current storage methods; who knows what will come next?<p>Finally, Google can't survive forever on advertising. I frankly expected the online advertising market to be having greater problems by now than it is. Still, AdBlock Plus is popular and I've seen a few articles recently that are tentatively suggesting that buying advertising on Facebook probably isn't worth it. Google's building some actual consumer hardware now, which is super neat, but their core competency is in data mining. I think it would be foolish to believe that if the online advertising market started to really struggle, Google would just drop the thing that they're best at and move on to something else.<p>So I don't think it's such a bad idea to treat Google with a little mistrust.<p>(But their fiber project is really damn cool.)",1343371531

4300241,comment,4293530,4299725,1,0,Nrsolis,,,"Well, at microwave frequencies (think anything at 10Ghz and up, really) you're already talking about directional antennas.  The RF engineers will call anything above 1Ghz microwave, but that's really splitting hairs.<p>Fiber is a waveguide and not much different in that respect from coaxial cable (or for that matter twister pair).  What matters is what kinds of frequencies the waveguide will accomodate and what kind of attenuation those frequencies will experience.  This matters for lots of important reasons.<p>As an example, take RG-6 coaxial cable (the kind you probably have in your home):<p>At 100Mhz (VHF) the attenuation is about 2.0 dB/100ft.<p>At 700Mhz (UHF) the attenuation is about 6.0 dB/100ft.<p>Now, take a look at Corning SMF-28 singlemode fiber:<p>At 1310nm (229.644 THz) the attenuation is 0.35dB/kilometer.<p>At 1550nm (192.4 THz) the attenuation is 0.22dB/kilometer.<p>So, fiber is an exceptional waveguide at very high frequencies, which makes it uniquely suitable for high-bandwidth communications.  Compared to all of the other waveguides, it's the most durable, most compact, and most future-proof solution.<p>Except when you can't use it.<p>SO, what's left?  Wireless probably.  Well, there is free-space optical which uses the same 1550nm frequency but has  the problem of aligning the transmitter and receiver to have a completely free line-of-sight.  Then there is the fact that attenuation through free space isn't the same as within a fiber.  Attenuation at 1550nm ranges from 0.2dB/km (clear) to 100dB/KM (foggy).  So, the atmosphere is a shitty waveguide for optical frequencies.<p>But there is still a chance with wireless, since we aren't restricted to the propagation characteristics of optical frequencies or the directionality.  With advanced modulation techniques (CDMA/OFDM), it's actually pretty easy to fit many more bits/hertz than you could with fiber transmission systems.  It's just that that sort of heroics is not needed for fiber systems since it's easy to get extra bandwidth with another fiber.<p>Now, when you are talking about ""last-mile"" types of solutions, it really depends on what the alternatives are and what the ""load-factor"" is for that method.  There is a big difference between phone calls and streaming audio for example when it comes to wireless systems.  All of those things need to be taken into account.<p>IMHO, the end-game is probably going to be coax to a smaller set of homes using whatever flavor of DOCSIS is available at that moment.  Most CableCo networks are mostly fiber anyhow.  Once you get to a certain ""cluster size"" the choice of fiber to the home versus fiber to the local node and then coax to the house becomes an engineering question.  For lower bandwidth or other services, you'll see wireless broadband displace some take-up of coax-base services.  The only reason I think this will happen is because the coax is already deployed (and so it will be used).  If we didn't have almost universal penetration of coax into the average home, there would be no question that most broadband would be wireless to the home.<p>The FTTH systems now being deployed have lots more in common with cable systems than is commonly understood.  Your fiber doesn't actually go ALL the way to the central office.  Your fiber is split at some point in the neighborhood (from 4-64 homes) and then is carried to the central office.",1343369955

She started selling phone calling credits online through a software designed to do so (for every 100 RMB she sells she gets 1 RMB). By now it already sounds like a scam (why wouldn't people who need calling credits go through this software by themselves) but apparently the software is legit.<p>Anyways, a guy called her yesterday telling her he urgently needed 10000 RMB worth of calling credit. Gullible as she is, she proceeded to transfer the money to this man's phone number (5000 RMB through Mastercard credit card and 5000 RMB by Union Pay debit card). The man was supposed to pay her money through Alipay (China's Paypal) and apparently showed her screenshots of the transfer happening. She just trusted him.<p>This morning, she found out it was a scam. The whole story is a bit confusing to me as well. My girlfriend is crying and her English isn't that good. She tried calling the scammer but of course his phone was closed and also tried to call her bank to get the credit card payment canceled but they told her they couldn't do anything unless she had lost/got stolen her credit card (seems they don't have chargebacks in China!?). She also called the police...<p>I'm looking for some clever way to get the money back through social engineering (especially the 5000 from the credit card which shouldn't be that hard). The money traveled this way: Credit Card -> Software vendor -> China Telecom -> Scammer's phone.<p>This is a lot of money for her (and for me at the moment).

I've been lucky enough to almost always work on things I've been interested in, and it has served me well in my career so far. I doubt I could even perform at 50% efficiency when using tools that don't excite me.<p>I've also had a ton of fun mastering and compulsively customizing  both VIM and Emacs :-)",1343368977

Little seems to motivate the American consumer -- and voter -- more than a bargain, or feeling they're getting ripped off.<p>And, since I'm typing away here, I hope Google will do it while treating their linepersons (technicians, etc.) decently.  As a recent story here, with its high rating, pointed out, people are tired of seeing the line workers being abused.<p>I'm not familiar with sonic.net in detail, but its CEO, Dane, seems a decent sort, and I bet they're not the worst employer -- whether direct or contract.  (And since Google's already talking to him, maybe you all can pick his brains in this specific area.)<p>Google still does some things that piss me off. [1]  But I support this initiative -- I'll sign up as soon as I can, if and when -- unless Dane beats you to it.<p>[1] Mentioning just one item:  Give it up, already, with the ""true names"" initiative.  Anonymity has its value and place within the online domain.  Not just one of convenience, but one of necessity, for many people and contexts.<p>P.S.  I'm pretty tired, and I'm probably being to optimistic/idealistic, here.  OTOH, having directly observed the crap dished out by AT&T, Comcast, and the like, I can readily believe there is plenty of room for improvement.",1343368898

After playing around with the Nexus One from Google I/O, I'm convinced that a fully-functional platform is just as good as the locked-down Apple one.<p>I'd probably recommend Apple's mobile and tablet platform to less tech-savvy people because it's definitely a more streamlined experience for people who only do the things that it can do.<p>I'm torn right now because I really want an Android-capable, Google-branded tablet. It's not necessarily the curated computing experience, it's the form factor that's less frustrating than surfing on a phone keyboard, but more convenient than lugging my 15"" laptop around.",1273849157

You can't exceed your primitives, and matching Erlang's primitives turns out to be pretty hard. Any attempt to jam Erlang's primitives into Javascript will make it not Javascript anymore, but some derived language that merely resembles Javascript.<p>Node.js will get better, but it will get spanked by Erlang at high loads and with lots of processes, and while there isn't <i>nothing</i> that Node.js can do about it, there's a limit to what they can do and still be JS.<p>(Interestingly, this is not necessarily true in general. It is particularly true here because Javascript is the colloquial term for ECMAScript, which is a standard. To get the requisite primitives in there would require changes that violate the standard, such as the execution environments and the way references are treated.

He has some helpful (free) tutorials available as well.<p><i>What is the best part about working with Android?</i><p>For me: flexibility and transparency.  I like to get my hands dirty and gain a deeper understanding of the system, and it's quite helpful having (1) access to the source code for almost the entire system and (2) root access on the device.  Those things likely won't matter when you're writing your first Android app, but it will matter when you're doing something uncommon or complex.<p><i>Are there are any CoreData like persistence frameworks?</i><p>I haven't needed any for my own apps, but the framework has integrated data storage engines.  I imagine that someone has built a CoreData-like layer that uses them.  This link might be helpful: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/371538/any-good-orm-tools-for-android-development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/371538/any-good-orm-tools...</a><p><i>Is three weeks, give or take a few days, too aggressive a deadline for doing a port from iPhone to Android?</i><p>Can you give us any more details?  Your time commitment will vary significantly depending on the complexity of the app.  If it's a 3D game, then three weeks might not cut it.  If it's a reasonably straight-forward app that doesn't have a ton of features, then three weeks will be ample time given your prior experience.<p>A few other thoughts: don't be afraid of Android UI building.  It isn't as scary as it sounds.  heliodorj's comments about reading the Activity/Intent/Multitasking documentation are spot on -- making sure that you grok those concepts will save you time and frustration.  Be sure to test on a real phone, preferably one that isn't super speedy so that you don't frustrate users with older hardware (e.g., the G1, aka HTC Dream).",1273848578

The goal of 95% of these schools is to extract the federal student loan money from the student as efficiently as possible with a nominal focus on quality of education.<p>To prove it, spend a half hour reading online education feeder sites that provide reviews (do a few google searches). They fall into three buckets - 80% complain about the aggressive recruiting tactics, poor education and poor customer service. 15% are sock-puppets paid by the universities to write reviews. 5% are satisfied students.<p>But here's the rub - and I wake up daily baffled by this phenomenon, but the students read the reviews and still attend the schools.<p>There are by my estimation four reasons for this:<p>First, you're dealing with, ironically, uneducated, low-income people who don't understand what they're getting into - they have been lead to believe that a college degree is worth something, and they'll take 30-40K of UNFORGIVABLE debt (because it's a federal loan) to make minimum wage.<p>Second, you're in an environment (higher education) where the very idea of certifying and grading the quality of education would have been unthinkable in decades past and the regulatory environment hasn't caught up with the business realities.<p>Third, the ease of access to government money won't dry up until major changes are made at the federal level and there's little likelihood that politicians would set themselves up as being against education for lower-income students. Lobbying has ramped up to protect the stream of 20-30 billion dollars of money flowing into the industry.<p>Fourth, aggressive recruiting tactics driven by the money at stake are keeping the doors full and forcing students into school without knowing what they're getting into.",1273846496

The direct flight was pretty expensive, but a flight out of Berlin was many-hundreds of euro less... with a connection in Amsterdam (of course).<p>As you would expect, the airline wouldn't let him just board in Amsterdam.  So he packed his things and took a €75 train to Berlin early in the morning, and had his family wish him farewell later that evening back in Amsterdam, during his connection.<p>It was a pain in the ass, but it saved him a ton of money, at great expense to the airline.",1273845863

1347341,comment,1346103,1346458,0,0,roel_v,,,"> It seems that a lot of startups say they value life/work separation.<p>Of course they say so. Deloitte says so too, and Wachtell, and Cravath, and every other high pressure professional outfit. Doesn't make it true.<p>> There has also been research to suggest that working that much is anti-productive.<p>Yeah but most of those are in different circumstances. It all depends on where the motivation comes from. If you take a wage slave and whip him into working 80 hours, while paying for 40, and not dangling any form of carrot in front of him/her (making partner), of course productivity will go down. If you've got a product you believe in, a vision to make it come true, an innate drive to succeed no matter what, and no personal life, you can work 80 or 100 hours a week for months on end and get the work of 5 or 10 people done in that time.",1273845725

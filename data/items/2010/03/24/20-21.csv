For example:<p><pre><code>  The cat ate the mouse.\n</code></pre>\nis active, because the cat is the subject of the sentence, and is doing the eating.<p><pre><code>  The mouse was eaten by the cat\n</code></pre>\nis passive, because the mouse is the subject, but is ""having something done to it"", i.e., passive.<p>So in the case of ""He was disappeared"", the point is that you are implying that he did not make himself disappear, but that it was done to them.<p>However, in Chinese, the language is so flexible that there are many far more common ways to express the same concept. So when someone specifically uses the passive voice in this way, while it is grammatically correct (or at least, is a grammatical invention that follows existing rules), it is obvious to other Chinese-speakers that it's an unusual way to say something.<p>The examples given start making more sense when you forget about the fact that ""suicided"" isn't a real word. It's not supposed to be a real word, instead it is meany to be a translation into English that preserves the 'strangeness' of the phrase.<p>In the case of the Chinese, use of the passive voice in this way is kind of like a shibboleth in that someone who agrees with your politics will know what you really mean, but you still have plausible deniability for those that don't.",1269462610

Imagine this scenario: You sell your <i>first</i> company, perhaps you've bootstrapped it and perhaps you sell it for 8 digits. Then you can create a <i>second</i> company (yes, people, it IS possible to create TWO companies unless your fist company was a fluke and you're unable to come up with a second company idea). Starting a second company with serious money in the bank gives one a level of freedom you cannot possibly imagine today. The 37Signals gurus always express their ideas relative to having only a single company in one's lifetime (because that's what they know). I've started and sold two companies to date and I couldn't be happier with the outcome (that's an understatement). I am having more fun than I ever had in my life and had I not sold, I would have never met my fiance -- she's the true passion in my life and startups don't hold a candle to her!<p>And my next company will be something wayyy out there -- probably so far out that I can't get funding because it's too risky. The only reason I can do that is because I sold my first two companies very early on and I have just enough financial wiggle room to where I can, for now, take some risks. I see companies like 37Signals making safe, predictable product bets and leaning on their brand and existing customer base for income, and that's fine. But the world needs risk takers, too. And taking risk requires capital and if that means selling a couple of companies before they turn into empires, then count me in! If I were to do it all over, I wouldn't change a thing.",1269462509

Or when you think they’re overvaluing the prospects of your company. That’s either the talk of the meek or a con man (“let’s get these suckers to overpay for this company of questionable value…”).<p>Of course the trillion dollar number is ridiculous (just trying to make a point) but you can insert whatever number you want.  DHH directly says you should only sell if you think the buyer can do better or if they overvalue your company.<p>As far as selling because you think the buyer can do better goes, does anyone actually do that?  How many people are strong enough to build a company to the point where someone wants to buy it and then suddenly turn meek when the offer is on the table?<p>Selling your company doesn't make you a con man either.  Even if someone overpays. If someone overpays, should you offer to give back the difference?<p>Like I said in my original comment, there is a lot of truth in what 37signals has to say, including this post, but sometimes they stretch it too far.",1269461356

Going back to the early-to-mid-20th century, China faced invading armies, a bitter civil war, and a communist revolution -- together killing  tens of millions. In the 19th century, China was dominated by western foreign powers, and had another civil war -- the Taiping rebellion -- that featured a self-proclaimed ""brother of Jesus"" leading a ""heavenly army"" in a conflict that killed 25 million -- proportionately more than the US lost in its civil war of the same period (which had fewer cult/messianical undertones).<p>US domestic policy is still informed (and twisted) by our far-more-mild experiences over the same periods. So it's understandable that the technocratic Chinese leadership thinks that their own population, without strong central control, is prone to be caught up in giant ideological swings and civil wars.<p>While not excusing human rights violations, this insight should at least make their mindset a little less mysterious. America has had the luxury of seeing openness work for two centuries at the same time China was suffering religious, imperialist, and ideological misery.",1269461207

1216719,comment,1216583,1216583,0,0,chipsy,,,"Here are my notes:<p>Use ON_ENTER_FRAME events and getTimer(), not TIMER. The Timer class is a low-accuracy system good for tweens, but it runs aground of Flash's ""elastic racetrack"" throttling behavior: Flash will try to keep a balance between rendering frames and code execution and that conflicts with the absolute control a game needs. ON_ENTER_FRAME will keep your main loop running once-per-frame, which is what you want; with getTimer() you can still apply a dT to your objects.<p>You're using strings in your enumerated constants. These will compare slower than integers. However, the bigger concern for performance is.....<p>You're using the Flash transform functions on a per-frame basis for rotations. This will always be slow; software rendering is fast only at simple memory copies and nothing else, which translates to using copyPixels as much as possible in the inner loop. Hence the performant way to architect Flash games is to prerender a giant spritesheet with draw(), use that as a lookup table for each rotation, and to draw the result onto a single surface rather than to maintain objects on the display list, because the Flash display list will do event processing per object. If you need to finely control draw layers, defer the actual rendering operation into a queue for each layer, and do it all in one pass later.<p>Your ""GameObject"" won't scale well for a more complex game because it mix three concerns(drawing, motion, collision) in a single class. This caveat is true of the Flixel/Flashpunk architectures too; a more factored approach would be to push these things into components and instance them on each entity type. For an example of a more factored entity system look at Pushbutton Engine.<p>Anyway, it looks pretty good overall, but it's a simple game. The companies may be looking for something a little more elaborate.",1269461010

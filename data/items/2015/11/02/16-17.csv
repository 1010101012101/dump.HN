10493049,comment,10492251,10492609,0,0,pron,,,"There are many feature-level differences, but the biggest differences are in the approach, goals and philosophy[1].<p>When it comes to philosophy, Kotlin is a modern Java -- i.e. a &quot;blue-collar&quot; language[2], aiming to adopt only tried-and-true ideas and not to break new grounds. Scala is most certainly not blue-collar, serving as a basis for a few PhDs, and incorporates many ideas that haven&#x27;t been tried in the industry. Scala is adventurous; Kotlin tries hard not to be.<p>When it comes to goals, Kotlin aims to solve Java&#x27;s pain points (nulls, properties, beans) while keeping the same libraries. Kotlin doesn&#x27;t even have much of a runtime library to speak of. A Java library <i>is</i> an idiomatic Kotlin library, and is almost indistinguishable from Kotlin libraries when used from Kotlin (i.e., no limited functionality, no wrappers needed). Kotlin&#x27;s design is built around this core idea. While Scala interoperates with Java, it has its own runtime library, and many types (e.g. collections) need to be wrapped when passed across languages.<p>When it comes to approach, Kotlin is developed hand-in-hand with its tools (IDE, build, multi-lang compilation), and made to be gradually adopted into Java codebases. You can easily mix Kotlin and Java classes in the same package (the IDE will even convert any given Java class to a Kotlin class, and seamlessly handle mixed-language codebases). Scala and its tools are developed separately, and it&#x27;s built to be independent of Java (although it interoperates with it). Another difference in approach (although it&#x27;s still theoretical so not quite fair) is that the Koltin dev promise that the language will be source and binary backwards-compatible starting with the imminent version 1.0 (though this promise hasn&#x27;t been put to the test), while Scala allows for occasional breaking changes.<p>[1]: Java and C have very similar syntax, yet the two are completely different (although Kotlin and Scala are probably more similar to one another than Java and C).<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/avp/pdf/feel-of-java.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/avp/pdf/feel-of-java....</a>",1446483583

Just needs businesses with the right model, and entrepereneurs with the desire to do this.<p>As for what you could do personally, unless you&#x27;re up for changing your whole life and starting a company there are a few other options.  You could maybe organise some way to give a local refugee home internet access (loaned laptops from somewhere with supervised use? wifi?).

We believe that what we&#x27;re working on is the biggest financial and social impact opportunity in the world today. Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Founded by Kaggle&#x27;s past president and chief scientist, its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors&#x27; notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We&#x27;ve raised $15m funding and have a small team of 16 applied machine learning researchers and commercialization experts.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we&#x27;re a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges. We use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas/Numpy/etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, React and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world. We&#x27;re working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important. We&#x27;re also looking for MD/PhDs with physics or comp sci backgrounds to help us brings the worlds of medicine and machine learning together.<p>Have a look at our team to see whether you think you might be a good fit <a href=""http://www.enlitic.com/team.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enlitic.com/team.html</a> .

Record-and-replay tools like mec-replay, rr, <a href=""https://github.com/moyix/panda"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/moyix/panda</a>, and <a href=""http://velvetpulse.com/2012/11/27/scribe-the-deterministic-transparent-record-replay-engine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://velvetpulse.com/2012/11/27/scribe-the-deterministic-t...</a> need to be able to intercept that access in order to record the relevant data.<p>Edit: of course, I should have mentioned that doesn&#x27;t apply to PANDA — by recording events at a non-system-call interface, PANDA avoids the problems of system-call emulation and instead has the problems of hardware emulation. I imagine PANDA will be a heck of a lot more useful for debugging new bare-metal operating systems.  The publisher regrets the error.<p>Time-travel debugging and deterministic replay is such a fundamentally important feature, and it can expand our capabilities in many different ways that we&#x27;re only starting to explore.  Debugging is just one possible application; consider also exhaustive testing of error conditions, re-execution of optimistic transactions that hit a write conflict, temporal backtracking search over executions, data prevalence (though it doesn&#x27;t solve the schema upgrade problem), and deterministic building.  And remember that the hardest problem for reverse-mode automatic differentiation is figuring out how to &quot;run the program backwards&quot; in order to find the gradient of the output; deterministic replay strategies are directly applicable to this problem and therefore to generalized gradient descent.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that mec-replay fell by the wayside 20 years ago.

I see bait and switch here.<p>Will the &quot;find your passion&quot; career advice work for everyone?  No.  Is there worse career advice than this?  Absolutely.  The title and theme of this post are overblown.<p>Some folks are defining passion as a sort of dreamy thing, and that dreams are bad.  That is vastly over-simplifying it.  Finding passion is an intangible goal and is intentionally positive-sounding in order to <i>encourage people to learn more about the smaller steps to achieving their goals.</i>  It is a sound byte.<p>I understand that finding passion is not going to work for everyone.  But this notion that it is &quot;terrible career advice&quot; is going too far.  Why so much hate?<p>For those who can find their passion, society benefits greatly.  These folks will not hesitate to work harder for something in which they believe.  Does it suck for a company to lose a few people who are trying to find their passion?  Yes.  That&#x27;s the nature of well paying fields such as IT.<p>It is better to get accustomed to losing a few good employees than to continue rallying against something that isn&#x27;t really under your control.  After all, from what I understand, during an interview with YC, they are looking more at the people than the ideas.  I&#x27;m not an applicant but I do respect their selection process.  The brick wall breakers they seek are first and foremost passionate.",1446483056

If you&#x27;re stuck in the Java ecosystem, Kotlin will make your life much better.<p>I also recommend it for people coming from the world of dynamic typing (Ruby, Javascript, Python, etc.). If you can appreciate the guarantees of a static type system -- and I submit that anyone who has worked on a project of more than a few KLOC can -- give Kotlin a try. It&#x27;s much less verbose than Java, and gives you the tools and constructs to program in much the same style as you would in a dynamic language, but with extremely good compile-time correctness checks. It may not be Haskell, but it&#x27;s pragmatic, practical and productive.<p>The tooling is also world class, as you might expect from a language developed by JetBrains. I recommend using Kotlin with IntelliJ -- the intellisense is guaranteed to boost your productivity.<p>Seamless Java interop has been a huge priority for the developers, so the ecosystem is also quite good. Its biggest weakness (for my use case anyway) is the lack of a good, modern web framework. Hopefully now that Kotlin is more stable a native library ecosystem will emerge that plays to Kotlin&#x27;s strengths more than Java&#x27;s.",1446482733

10492899,comment,10492251,10492609,0,0,gecko,,,"Kotlin has a much simpler syntax, and much simpler semantics, than Scala. Specifically, it&#x27;s largely a very, very good syntax, and small class library extension, for otherwise-vanilla alternative syntax to Java.<p>This is the whole reason for its existence: Kotlin code cleanly interoperates, in both directions, with existing Java code. From my own experience, this means that it&#x27;s very easy compared to Scala to introduce into an existing code base: you can sanely go class by class, file by file, cleaning up code, relying on the existing unit tests, without breaking anyone&#x27;s workflow. As a result, it has, in my experience, proved a lot cheaper than Scala to train new devs in it as well.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s all just syntax, though. Kotlin also brings null safety, traits, builders, and some other key things over from the Scala, Groovy, other sources, which has proven to be a major productivity boost. Its collections library is a lot saner (IMHO) than Java 8&#x27;s due to better generics support. It adds data types and value semantics for when you need them as well. But it does so in a way that (again, based on experience introducing Kotlin into a company after Scala had failed to gain any traction) is a lot easier to teach to most developers, and a lot easier to integrate into existing workflows.",1446482619

I grew up in the &quot;boonies&quot; and I sometimes think that childhood/teenage boredom due to not having many things to do or other young people nearby influenced my feelings on the matter.<p>But the one thing that makes me consider moving to a more rural setting is the fact that I sometimes <i>want</i> to make noise (playing instruments, etc) but there aren&#x27;t as many opportunities when I live in a townhouse.  I mostly just compromise by playing at lower volumes (less fun when it comes to playing guitar or whatever), playing through headphones (again, less fun because lower volume or using headphones doesn&#x27;t give the satisfaction of how a guitar or bass sounds through a proper amp at &quot;rock and roll&quot; volumes).<p>Still, I&#x27;m not a total asshole so I limit my volumes and I only play during hours when it&#x27;s much less likely that anyone nearby would be sleeping.  I also keep that stuff in the basement so it doesn&#x27;t &quot;leak&quot; out as much that way.<p>If I had the money to just buy an old warehouse or a property in a remote location for playing music or watching movies on a projection screen with theater-volume speakers, I&#x27;d do it in a heartbeat but that&#x27;s just a pipe dream.  I don&#x27;t have the funds to purchase or rent access to such a space.<p>So for now, the solution is to play music quieter/at more &quot;decent&quot; hours and keep the theater experience restricted to outdoor movies at a friend&#x27;s house in the country during the summer.  For these sorts of activities that go hand in hand with loud volume, you really are more limited in the city.

That fingerprint alone is sent to the server for matching. Note that there is no way to reverse that process (hence the hash analogy) to get audible sounds out of it.

10492850,comment,10483365,10490568,0,0,devonkim,,,"One thing I observed as an everyday user and developer on a visual language / ecosystem was that design patterns emerged that were really easy to do in most text programs that were really cumbersome to do in block diagrams but I could find almost nothing that was easier in a visual language than a textual one. For example, most modern class-based OOP systems have virtual inheritance possibilities where you can overload behaviors and we have compiler resolution that determines what can and can&#x27;t perform the override. I have not found an easy way to show this visually across many block diagrams without introducing a lot of confusion (eg. dotted lines instead of solid ones, collapsing box groups together) because of issues like dynamic dispatch. This stuff is pretty easy to form the constructs as a competent programmer but once I was in a visual language I was flipping around pages and pages of pretty blocks that started to get in the way rather than guide me towards understanding the 500 blocks I dropped down and the rats nest of lines pointing everywhere with switch statements galore. In our system I tried to write dependency injection and other elements of aspect oriented programming in but the inability for easy to associate referential steps in our specific system really messed with usability and thus debugging capabilities. As a power user I was not that much more productive than a relative novice in our system, and that really bothered me on what kept my productivity in the system from growing.<p>Eventually it all came down to inability for automatic, sensible scoping of logical components to be performed in our software due to lack of awareness of what the user is actually looking for because of lack of typing (we didn&#x27;t have data structures / types - numbers and strings were all the same raw data) - all the analysis that could be done effectively for users was done following program execution, not really static analysis of a dataflow / graph. Everything was a side effect in a block diagram system just like how it can be in OOP, but unlike in OOP I had a heck of a time pointing references to a fragment under test to, say, a mock step easily (we did add them in eventually but scoping the substitution was insane). We have automatic folding in text editors that does pretty well, too, but grouping a bunch of randomly laid out shapes on a canvas together and hiding them while selecting them with a mouse was really painful for the minimal value it&#x27;d provide.<p>What happens is that the structure of the dataflow becomes a concern orthogonal to the basic algorithmic steps like looping, string manipulation, logical operators, arithmetic operators. Because most of the limitations of software production happen due to people&#x27;s lack of tooling or abilities to reason about their data and behaviors efficiently / effectively, this means that given the failures so far in visual programming systems we probably need to re-think usability first before trying to develop a programming system around it.<p>The reasons we were able to get much success in our product with a visual programming paradigm was\n1. we used users&#x27; existing expectations from products like Visio to help with onboarding / training\n2. we developed complex logic like web requests in normal code (Java) and packaged them up into block diagram components that are easy to configure, so it was a lot like Automator constructs\n3. everything was fairly easy to trace during program runs (required for auditors anyway)<p>This all came with a large amount of resource costs though which is why it never really would have worked as a consumer product unfortunately.",1446482215

Further, throughput in bio problems tends to be embarassingly parallel- so Intel putting more cores into chips with NUMA memory is a huge win.  Next, when Intel puts more cores in a cheap, everybody&#x27;s bio codes, which are embarassingly parallel, run faster because you just added more embarassingly parallel capacity.  Nobody had to rewrite codes- in the GPU area, you have to rewrite codes every 2 years to compete with Intel throughput.<p>Moore&#x27;s law is irrelevant here.  It&#x27;s about the total cost of doing science, and moving sequence analysis to GPUs hasn&#x27;t really decreased the cost significantly.  Note the first paper you linked to is from 2007- neither CPU nor GPU from that time period is relevant today.  All the links I see for &quot;GPU HMMER&quot; point to a few marketing pages on the Nvidia site.<p>Whether BLAST is 10X faster on GPUs (its not) is irrelevant.  It&#x27;s that there aren&#x27;t interesting problems to be solved by speeding up these kinds of calcuations in terms of single problem latency- what matters is throughput- aligning billions of reads in a short time- and those problems tend to be disk IO bound, not CPU bound.<p>I have no problem using GPUs- those are relatively easy to program now and we&#x27;ve raised a generation of grad students who can write codes to those platforms.  They&#x27;ve proved their way.<p>It&#x27;s ASIC and FPGAs which aren&#x27;t competitive in this area.",1446481617

10492761,comment,10491038,10491863,0,0,bphogan,,,"Warning - most of this is just my opinion as a student and as a teacher in adult education. The article talks about a lot of this which makes me happy.<p>Lecture is my biggest problem with MOOCs. Lecture is the easiest and laziest way to teach a topic. I know because on my lazy days I tend to find myself falling back on it with my students.  When I first started teaching I leaned on it heavily, and have learned it doesn&#x27;t really work. Nobody retains anything of value.<p>Adults learn new things by doing and discussing. And adults zone out frequently. Really, the most the average adult can listen is about 15 minutes anyway, and after 10 you&#x27;ve probably lost interest.  See <a href=""http://www.mrmediatraining.com/2012/08/23/how-many-minutes-is-the-audiences-attention-span/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrmediatraining.com/2012/08/23/how-many-minutes-i...</a> for some interesting info on that.<p>If you watch a cooking show, you learn some techniques. But unless you get in the kitchen and try to make that cake, <i></i>and have someone give you feedback on your technique<i></i>, then you won&#x27;t learn how to do it.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t scale online. Feedback and assessment simply don&#x27;t work at that kind of level. And we know it doesn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why in big lecture situations in traditional schools, there are lots of TAs, tutors, or supplemental instruction sessions to help people learn. But lectures scale really well for MOOCs so that&#x27;s what they end up being - a series of video lectures. It&#x27;s easy. Just record yourself talking and throw it online. And it&#x27;s easy for students, too. They don&#x27;t have to do things, they don&#x27;t have to talk to anyone. They can just listen. And maybe zone out for a bit.<p>A huge benefit is that, as mentioned here, If you missed something in a lecture on video, you can rewind. But if you had a question or something to add, then the opportunity to do that in context is lost.<p>And that&#x27;s where I think a lot of the dropoff happens too.  We don&#x27;t learn that way as adults. We learn by doing things and engaging with people. And if you can just take a course by watching someone talk to you, you&#x27;ve not really learned.  You&#x27;ve just been told some stuff.<p>And this is why adults make comments like &quot;I love online classes because I can slow the lecture down or rewind,&quot;  Adules have been conditioned that lecture is how you&#x27;re supposed to learn.  Rewinding and slowing down is a bandage over the real problem; too much lecture and not enough application means you don&#x27;t really learn - you don&#x27;t retain things.<p>One last thing - lecture is highly effective for entry-level content if chunked. 15 minutes of lecture followed by direct application of the content or practice, followed by a review or reflection.  Dr. Christine Harringon has some great insights on this. See <a href=""http://drchristineharrington.org/publications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drchristineharrington.org/publications</a> for some.<p>I think the future of online learning is going to involve finding a way to scale the practice and assessment parts of learning. And I see interesting movement out there on that.",1446481475

10492642,comment,10490931,10490931,0,0,mindslight,,,"I understand where the author is coming from - high speed serial transceivers really have undermined our traditional concept of a &quot;machine&quot;. And in the uniform administrative domain of a data center, hardware refactorings are straightforward. So it&#x27;s pretty nifty to think about these changes to fundamental constants (although the continual rewriting of software systems because they&#x27;re not abstracted enough to treat it all as one cache hierarchy is disheartening).<p>But when moving across administrative boundaries, especially to a more ad-hoc environment, serious problems crop up. Some assumptions the author is handwaving away:<p>1. That 2ms to Youtube is to a single specific Youtube <i>cache</i>. If you&#x27;re about to get on a plane, are you supposed to inform Google so that they can move your files across the country?<p>2. &quot;The network is reliable&quot; - what do you do while you&#x27;re <i>on</i> that plane? DSL is still our national infrastructure policy so in many places that is the best that is available, especially if you want a choice of providers to avoid anti-consumer behavior.<p>2a. Or wifi. What is the latency of modern best-of-class consumer gear? I&#x27;m getting 16ms with a simple TL-WR703N. Never mind mobile...<p>3. Access patterns being so long-tail points to the continuing utility of end-user SSDs as non-volatile cache. The devices that would be most likely to drop them (cost, space, power) are generally on the worst network links.<p>4. The datacenter containing the notion of what data is authoritative (otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t need to hit it for every access as outlined). What is the need for this?<p>5. The overhead of implementing oblivious transfer (or the alternative of being surveilled and having decreased economic power and freedom).<p>When you think in terms of datacenters, it&#x27;s tempting to think that the next advancement is end-user computers becoming part of that system, but that is a skewed perspective. The pendulum swings back and forth, and I think we&#x27;re pretty close to Peak Butt.  The next deluge will be user-centric software that utilizes the butt for its strengths, but respects privacy and tracks the authoritative copy on user owned machines.",1446480718

This is all hard to determine without data, and some of what I am worried about is a risk rather than a current reality, though it appears to be growing.<p>Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m coming from - in my lifetime, the percentage of SF residents under the age of 18 has dropped from about 22% to below 14%.  Much of this happened without airbnb or short term rentals, so obviously they can&#x27;t be the core cause.  However, it could exacerbate it.<p>Airbnb makes it far easier to rent out a &quot;spare&quot; bedroom - in doing so, they vastly increase the value of having a &quot;spare&quot; bedroom that you don&#x27;t use.  So if you are a family with just one kid, three bedroom houses suddenly become much more attractive than two bedroom houses, because what used to be an occasional guest room is now an income generator.  What happens when a family with two kids goes up against them in a bidding war?  One family can factor in the extra income, the other factors in no extra income and the additional expenses of an additional kid.<p>airBnB(noKids, hasKids) {\n  unless(noKids.income(isWayHigherThan(hasKids.income)) {\n     numKidsSF--;\n  }\n}<p>At least in that scenario someone is still going to be &quot;from&quot; SF (when this is no longer the case, SF will be nothing more than a disneyland for young people and empty nesters).<p>It can get worse - what happens if investors now realize that they can just buy the whole 3br house and treat it as a hotel?<p>I could see airbnb being a factor in driving the already collapsing percentage of SF residents who are children to even lower lows.<p>By the way, in all of this, I see a good place for airbnb.  If a San Francisco family wants to leave for a vacation in Paris, and they can rent out their place for a couple of weeks, and vice-versa, this seems like <i>a good thing</i>.  But if converting a &quot;spare&quot; bedroom means that what were formerly kid&#x27;s bedrooms are too profitable as tourist rentals to be wasted on children, then no, this would be extremely destructive to SF.<p>We need to regulate this, and airbnb needs to be a good citizen and cooperate.

I don&#x27;t see that changing any time soon ...<p>This is a very interesting phenomenon. It was certainly true from around 1968 to 2005, that custom chips could not survive since the next Intel chip made them irrelevant. But I think that, not only is this going to be changing soon, in fact it has already started to change.<p>There are credible claims of BLAST (and other life science codes) being ~10x faster on GPUs than CPUs. [1] GPUs are specialized processors (with associated non-standard programming models and compilers) that have overtaken general purpose CPUs in many areas. This has been possible because, for the past 10 years, the &quot;next Intel chip&quot; has NOT been faster (single core clock speed) or exponentially cheaper (cost per core). Intel has been unable to make advances on these fronts due to fundamental engineering factors, such as the breakdown of Dennard scaling around 2005. [2]<p>GPUs (and FPGAs, and to some extent even conventional CPUs) have been able to continue advancing since 2005 because Moore&#x27;s Law has been holding (even though the related Dennard scaling law has broken down). However, now we are seeing that even Moore&#x27;s law is starting to break down. This is evidenced by the increasing delays in the Intel roadmap, with the most recent delay being 10nm process being pushed out to 2017. [3] It is now in question whether silicon process will ever even reach 7nm, and I don&#x27;t think anyone is willing to bet that Moore&#x27;s Law can continue on silicon beyond 7nm.<p>It is at the end of Moore&#x27;s Law where custom chips become very interesting. This has been covered in 2013, in a presentation by Robert Colwell, who is the Director of DARPA&#x27;s Microsystems Technology Office. [4] Colwell&#x27;s thesis is that the End of Moore&#x27;s law will revive specialized chip design. I find that prospect to be very exciting, not only for chip designers but of course also for software developers (especially compiler and programming language designers, as specialized chips are going to require specialized compilers, programming models and languages).<p>Of course there is also the other possible future path, within the 10nm to 7nm time frame (i.e. within the next 5 years) that Intel and others will find a way to extend Moore&#x27;s Law, possibly by finding a viable alternative to silicon substrate. That would also be extremely exciting but somehow I don&#x27;t think the future will be that simple  (DARPA seems to take the view that this simple isn&#x27;t going to happen, i.e. the Moore&#x27;s Law exponential must logically end).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.nvidia.com/object/bio_info_life_sciences.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nvidia.com/object/bio_info_life_sciences.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling#Recent_breakdown_of_Dennard_scaling"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling#Recent_breakdo...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/9447/intel-10nm-and-kaby-lake"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/9447/intel-10nm-and-kaby-lake</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.hotchips.org/wp-content/uploads/hc_archives/hc25/HC25.15-keynote1-Chipdesign-epub/HC25.26.190-Keynote1-ChipDesignGame-Colwell-DARPA.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hotchips.org/wp-content/uploads/hc_archives/hc25/...</a>",1446480488

We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your résumé says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.<p>Pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo and Sydney. We will soon be opening an office in Berlin as well, with more to come. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to CF. We&#x27;re expanding what is the leading opensource PaaS and our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product ever. It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on -- except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is home to a fleet of battled-hardened products that we have been progressively open sourcing. Greenplum Database tackles some of the largest datasets in the world with the comfort and familarity of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, which we donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>We provide visa and relocation assistance. In the NYC office we have about 15 people from overseas, including Australians like me.<p>You can apply through our website: <a href=""http://pivotal.io/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pivotal.io/careers</a>.

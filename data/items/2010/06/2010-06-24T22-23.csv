This is when WordPress started to get real traction. Movable Type did something that pissed off a large number of their users (Moving previously free features into their paid plans if I remember) and WordPress wrote a dead simple migration tool. They then followed by writing a ton of tools to migrate from blogging software. Postures says[1] they are going to release one migration tool a day for the next 15 days...

That's the point. Merely being incredulous doesn't form a coherent argument against it. My angle on this is a little personal, which would probably automatically strip my it of any validity, but let me explain why. Perhaps it would make a compelling case to someone.<p>I'm originally from Bulgaria and graduated high school there. For obvious political reasons I hadn't traveled at all and I wanted to study in the US. I got into private and public schools, but the difference in the standard of living at the time was such that even with substantial financial aid I could only afford to go to a state school. Still, I'd get to see the US (New York in particular) and the draw of the adventure was enough to get me to go.<p>After school, like most international students, I took advantage of a program that is essentially an extended internship (OPT). There were hard time constraints, so I needed to find a job quickly. I ended up working at a consulting firm you never would have heard of doing mostly Java with a bit of Rails. It was a great place to work and I learned a lot. If the respect and trust of the people you work with counts for something, I'm fairly confident I got good.<p>None of this is something I could convey in a resume. Worse, Mr. Olsen would dismiss me outright because I have gone to a state school (because I was poor) and done Java (because I couldn't afford to sift through the market). Feel free to attribute this to cognitive dissonance, but I find his views arrogant, ineffective, and lacking a human approach. His argument is a pernicious over-simplification of a complex, human problem.",1277420039

We're just about done with our first three applications (in the process of getting one into the App Store, and two more are ETA to be done by the end of the week).<p>In case you're wondering what normal costs are for mobile application contracting: For simple apps, a fixed price would be in the $500 to $2000 range; something moderately complicated - say, an interface to a social network - would be in the $4000-6000 range; after that it usually goes on a case by case basis depending on what the customer wants.<p>(By the way, completely shameless plug: we're going to be done with our currently running contracts soon... so if anyone happens to be interested, contact info is in my profile.

Thus it is technically accurate to say that ""one exchange was sending an extremely high number of quotes"". It's in the exchange's best interest to disseminate quotes as quickly as possible in order to attract order flow and thus collect fees.<p>On the other hand, inter-exchange feeds are federally mandated and used primarily to comply with Regulation NMS rules that prevent trades from executing at a price inferior to the NBBO (national best bid/offer). In other words, if I send a buy order to NYSE but NASDAQ has a lower price, NYSE is required to either reject the order or route it to NASDAQ for a fee (it's up to the customer which method is used). It's not necessary to send 5000 quotes per second to another exchange because the primary motivation is compliance. Generally, institutions will send their orders directly to the exchange with the best price in order to avoid the extra fee for having it routed by the exchange.<p>I may be way off on the inter-exchange feeds as I am not a professional, but there are undoubtedly many here who are so please correct me.",1277418892

Aside from the ""Genius"" Bar, there were five employees helping customers and another two employees fiddling with boxes and displays.  There were seven or eight customers ahead of me impatiently waiting to be served.  There was a lot of ostentatious yawning, foot-tapping, and watch-checking.  In the ten minutes I stayed, the employees on the floor managed to serve and check out <i>four</i> customers.  Seven employees, ten minutes, four transactions.  That isn't incompetence.  That's policy.  They're inflating perceptions of their popularity and their importance.  If someone can see you without waiting, you aren't important.  If you hurry for someone, that makes them more important than you, so don't do it.<p>My question is, is this <i>ever</i> a good idea?

They are both completely distinct, unrelated and on separate servers. Meanwhile, google started crawling them immediately.<p>Interestingly, on the one that eventually got the home page indexed by bing, the bulk of the content is still not linked from the main page, but can be fully crawled via deeper links people have posted elsewhere. Google crawled it via those links, Bing still only sees the front page.",1277417186

But wouldn't it be a lot less risky to use the money from sales and subscription to pay for, say, one of Linode's heavy-iron (8-20GB) instances month to month? It seems to be a relatively small premium. And have you thought about letting your clients (or at least the desktop clients) do the transcoding for you?",1277417180

Could we come up with some self organizing numbering scheme (assuming the shop doesn't collaborate, and everybody in the queue already has an iPhone (pre-4), which seems reasonable)?
A problem could be that people would forget to check in once they had their turn at the counter, so maybe it would have to be some kind of dead man's button (""yes, I am still queueing"").",1277417029

332171,comment,331724,331881,0,0,raganwald,,,"By way of agreement with you, I will say there's no ""but in a way"" about it. As I recall--I was a Mac developer at the time--Copland was everything Jobs is not. A large, bureaucratic team. Infighting and feature poaching between the Pink and Blue teams with nobody to step in and provide Adult Supervision. No hard ship date with a command to abandon anything that wouldn't fit (real artists ship, Copland did not ship).<p>Much has been made of how little Jobs contributed to the original Macintosh. However, looking back we see what he did contribute: the all-consuming focus on shipping a product, and the willingness to make the hard decisions needed to do so.<p>This was entirely unlike the Copland effort in every which way.<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2lrwzd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/2lrwzd</a> (Wikipedia article on Copland)<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent</a> (and Taligent)",1223988440

In particular, even with a rumoured upgrade to the HDD, it's just too damn small, and the RAM would be a severely limiting factor for me. I'd much prefer a Macbook with as-is spec but minus the optical drive. It would make it a bit lighter, a bit thinner and a bit cheaper, too.",1223987587

In my mind, that means ""refreshingly deep"", but I bet in most minds it means ""booooooooooooooooring"".",1223986863

Few people maintain a property only to rent it for two weeks a year. Once you bother to rent it, you try to do it for as long as possible. On the other hand, people who buy one, two, ... n houses for vacationing or speculating purposes can often afford to have them empty.<p>In any event, that's irrelevant to my point. Be them a huge or tiny fraction, I'm not so much against those. A house that gets occupied, by owners or renters, for most of the year, serves a genuine need.",1223985741

Most development organizations, especially those in large enterprises, the primary users of RDBMS technology when this article was written, are more concerned with coming up with the correct solution at the fastest clip.

I'm well aware that I can hold down the trackpad button and use another finger to do long drags.<p>I've gone through the Synaptic driver settings as well as Windows' own mouse settings but there doesn't seem to be a way to set a bit of a timeout before it releases the drag. The closest setting I could see will allow this is the continuous drag area at the sides of the trackpad but it feels cumbersome.<p>The double-tap for right-clicks are also quite useful as the Eee PC's trackpad button is quite stiff. However, it's not possible with the Synaptics driver as well. Considering they have pinch, twist and other gestures, I'm surprised that double-taps as right-clicks isn't present.",1259020106

I think it amusing to see how smart people were thinking back then.<p>I built a system with OODB back in late 90s.  It was a pleasant experience in a way; I could walkaround inflexibility of RDBMS.  RDBMS works great if your data domain can be straightforwardly represented in relational model.  But if your application is inherently working on a graph, it becomes awkward to map it onto relational model.  With OODB, graphs formed by objects can be directory stored.<p>OTOH, I had a difficulty from the lack of good abstraction; ironically, implementaion of application data structure was too tightly coupled with the data storage model.  Application-level implementation details could affect data storage unnecessarily, or some optimization techniques in the db side could affect the application.   Relational model and SQL do give a good abstraction barrier in a sweet spot, at least for some type of applications.<p>I think graph database will give us this nice abstraction barrier for the network-of-object type application domain.

958365,comment,957936,957936,0,0,spudlyo,,,"This story is mostly true, although it's not quite how I remember it.  In 1989 I was a product support services intern working at Microsoft's Lincoln Plaza campus.  I worked for the 'System Languages' team, or SysLang as we called ourselves.  We supported Micorosft C 5.x, QuickC, and their Pascal product and associated tools like the M editor and CodeView.  One day (I don't remember if it was November or not) Bill came through on a tour of PSS.  I mentioned to another intern, Nadine, that it would be cool if Bill took a call from a customer.  When he came by our area with a group of other management types she bounded up to him with a huge smile on her face and asked if he'd like to see how things worked for himself, and take a call from a customer.  The people he was with tried to dissuade him of this idea, saying something about schedules and the like, but Bill liked the idea and wanted to do it.  At the time, I was a real clean freak, and my cube was very clean and devoid of clutter, so I suggested he sit down at my desk.  I explained to him how the Aspect phone system worked and how to look up things in our STARS knowledge base using an OS/2 terminal program connected to a DEC minicomputer.  He got settled in, and eventually took a call, greeting the customer like:<p>""Hello, Product Support Services, this is William, how may I help you?""<p>Just about everyone who wasn't currently on a call with a customer was gathered around my cube listening.  I seem to remember the customer having a problem with the linker.  Bill queried the knowledge base, which was normally painfully slow, but this time it was snappy and responsive.  The first result looked like it might have addressed the customer's problem, and Bill went with it.  I of course only heard one side of the conversation, but it sounded like the customer wasn't satisfied with the answer. Bill was firm yet polite, reassuring the customer that we had seen this problem before and that his solution was correct, and the customer eventually agreed to try the solution mentioned in the STARS article.  An hour or so later, my friend Tad got that customer again, and he mentioned that William had helped him with his problem earlier but his solution didn't work.  Tad let the customer know that he had in fact talked to Bill Gates, and helped him with his problem.  I don't remember how/if it got solved though.<p>That was quite a big day for me.  For years I had saved the yellow pad that had Bill's notes from the call.",1259018643

It bit me once when I tried to do FRP (Yampa-style) in Ocaml.  I couldn't define some of the operators (time) in a modular way (in terms of integral) without losing polymorphism.<p>Another reason has to do with the fact that Ocaml is strict. I tried to define a mini ""batteries"" module with purely functional lazy lists instead of destructive streams (the enumeration).  There is simply no way to define map or filter in terms of fold without losing laziness, or seriously polluting the type of fold, map, and filter.

958342,comment,957820,958250,0,0,stonemetal,,,"It is about state not necessarily mutable state.  Monads are rather abstract and not really worth all the attention they get. A monad is simply: a type constructor, a function that puts a value into the type constructor, and a function that pulls the value from the type constructor and pass it on to the next function(often referred to as return and bind respectively).  Then depending on how you define the type constructor and functions to push and pull you get different Monads.  Monads are no different than Objects or design patterns, they are a code organization technique that happens to fit functional programming well.",1259017843

958338,comment,956220,956220,0,0,spokey,,,"Hi David.<p>Congrats on the launch.<p>As others have said, this is certainly a competitive space, but I imagine there's still room for innovation.<p>This is a nice technical foundation. If I were you my next step would be to get it in front of real users and begin to understand the unique problem you should be solving.  I'd do three things in particular:<p>1) I'd pursue something like the ""customer discovery"" process to understand how your product concept maps to real customer needs.  (MaxKlein had a lot of good advice on that ""below"" at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=956354"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=956354</a>)<p>2) I'd look into usability testing (via paper prototyping or even something as simple as userfly.com) to get a better feel for how users interact with this interface. I imagine there are areas that users might find confusing and ways in which you could streamline the workflow.<p>3) I'd research the words or language you should be using on the website.  For instance, in various places on the site you refer to both ""Documents"" and ""Files"". Are they the same thing? You also use terms like ""Groups"", ""Users"", ""Permissions"", etc. Are these terms that resonate with your users? (I don't know that they aren't, I'd just make sure you have the terminology correct.)<p>I'm sure there are dozens of ways to skin this cat and advantages and disadvantages to each, but one thing that struck me when going through your site is that much of the functionality could be provided pretty much out of the box by other tools.  For example, Drupal's free Database File Manager module (<a href=""http://drupal.org/project/dbfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.org/project/dbfm</a>, demo at <a href=""http://dbfm.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dbfm.org/</a>, screenshots at <a href=""http://drupal.org/node/236711#comment-785302"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.org/node/236711#comment-785302</a>) offers most of the same functionality and in places with a little more polish.  I've no idea what your framework is (well, from your blog, I'm guessing Ruby), but you might be able to find something that does a lot of the grunt work of storing, serving and moving files for you so that you can focus on the value-add that Docley provides.<p>For what is is worth, here's a few specific bits of feedback for you:<p>1) Until you have it ready, I'd drop the ""Coming Soon"" video image from the homepage. Neither you nor users are getting value from the placeholder and having it there just calls attention to the missing demo.<p>2) In your grid of benefits (""Save time"", ""Share safely"", ""Search documents"", etc.), the images are links that don't go anywhere (they just link to ""#""), at least they are for me. Also, if these really are meant to be links, I'd make the whole box clickable, not just the images.<p>3) I'd trim the ""Feedback"" button out of the screenshots used in your help section (e.g., <a href=""http://www.docley.com/help/createfolder.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.docley.com/help/createfolder.html</a>). Personally I think they are distracting and make it harder to follow the breaks between screenshots.<p>4) I find the tiny document icons a little confusing or misleading. I'd test it with more users than just me, but you might consider adding some text or tweaking the icons a bit.  In particular:<p>a) The icon you're using for ""rename this file"" suggests ""edit"" to me.  You might want something more like these <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?q=rename&imgsz=i"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.google.com/images?q=rename&imgsz=i</a>.<p>b) The icon you're using for ""preview"" suggests ""search"" to me. Maybe just adding a document icon to it might help (e.g., <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?q=preview&imgsz=i"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.google.com/images?q=preview&imgsz=i</a>) but personally I still see that as search.<p>c) I'm not sure what the ""Usages"" icon is supposed to display.  From the icon (a little bar graph) I had expected statistics on the number of times the document has been viewed or something like that (for instance, what bit.ly displays for information on a URL).  I guess that is what it is displaying, but it is in a log format that seems inappropriate, especially given the icon you're using.  (And I had to look at this a couple of times to realize that you had a download history there, it looks like a commit history to me, something like what I'd expect behind the ""Versions"" icon.)  I'm not sure ""usages"" is a real word, maybe just ""usage"" or ""use"" (although that's easily confused with the verb) or ""statistics"" would be better?<p>5) A little bug I noticed: From your help pages (e.g. <a href=""http://www.docley.com/help/docleyhelp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.docley.com/help/docleyhelp.html</a>) and presumably anywhere you have a subdirectory in the URL your logo link is broken. You probably want to change <a class=""logo"" href=""index.html""> in your header template to <a class=""logo"" href=""/index.html"">.  On a related note, you might tweak your 404 page to be a little more helpful.  It's not currently branded, there's no search or browse suggestions, and there's not even a link back to the homepage. Non technical users might be confused: The only viable option is to click the back button and it seems entirely possible that users may be following a link to your site from an external one so that back takes them off your site entirely.<p>Good luck and keep iterating!",1259017642

958331,comment,958242,958242,0,0,grellas,,,"Repeal of Regulation D is huge and would, if effected, be highly negative for startup financing.<p>Before Reg D, the only way to handle an inter-state offering of stock in an early-stage company was to rely on so-called Section 4(2), a part of the Securities Act of 1933 that specified a bunch of murky factors for what constituted an ""exempt"" offering. If you failed to meet those requirements for your company when it issued stock to investors, not only your company but all of its controlling management could be sued and be required to refund all monies to investors for any non-compliant offering. The results were often highly surprising, e.g., where an issuer was found to have done a ""public offering"" when it issued stock to 20 investors or so.<p>Regulation D changed this whole landscape by defining a set of ""safe harbor"" requirements that, if met, assured the issuer and its management that the securities law rules were met. It has been a huge success in bringing certainty and clarity to an area that desperately needed it.<p>This is a surprise to me to learn that a Reg D repeal is to be found in Senator Dodd's proposed legislation. There have been absolutely <i>no</i> pending efforts to repeal Reg D and it is insane to do it, at least from the standpoint of startups and their investors.<p>The only thing could guess is that Senator Dodd is trying to slip this in as a favor to the trial lawyers. It would be highly dismaying, and quite shocking, if something like this does pass. It would definitely hurt startup funding in significant ways.",1259017242

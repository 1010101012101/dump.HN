9555687,comment,9555295,9555295,0,0,blumkvist,,,"Great article until the very end... Basic income is not the answer to this. Basic income will lead to terrible social decay caused by apathy and laziness, fueling even more government corruption and ultimately, totalitarianism.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think all of this talk and rhetoric in recent years is deliberate propaganda, conditioning left-leaning people.<p>I have seen a number of websites posted on HN, especially in comments, which are overly rhetoric and nudge the reader towards utopian left ideas. The sites are well developed both in the application and in the information architecture sense. They don&#x27;t seem to have revenue model and saying that tracking their financing proved difficult, would be an understatement.<p>Please remember that changing the social framework is a VERY delicate matter. Oftentimes things sound very good on paper, but are not practical at all. Basic income sounds dangerously close to &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot;. When people believed this can happen, it ended terribly. Not because of the specific people in charge at the time. Socialism/Communism as a model is doomed to fail because of human nature.<p>When you make social policy, you have to think about the lowest common denominator and currently, it is very low indeed.",1431773962
9555684,comment,9555295,9555617,0,0,avz,,,"Basic Income is not &quot;Quantitative Easing for people instead of banks&quot;.<p>Quantitative Easing is the creation of money to buy assets and therefore carries the risk of asset price inflation. It is used when the central bank <i>intends</i> assets prices to go up, e.g. after they slumped in a recession.<p>Basic Income on the other hand does not entail creation of new money. Most Basic Income proposals finance the costs through taxation or other government revenue (including savings from simplification and/or reduction of welfare programs that BI allows).<p>Creation of new money to redistribute to consumers would cause consumer price inflation and is unlikely to bring meaningful benefits in the long term.<p>EDIT: Also, the money created by the central bank in QE is <i>lent</i> to the government and/or banks, not <i>given</i> to them. It must be returned to the central bank. On the other hand, BI is not debt and need not be repaid.",1431773800

Routers fragment packets exceeding the link MTU in ipv4, they notify the source of the lower mtu in ipv6.<p>ping, TTL exceeded, destination (host, route or port) unreachable and parameter problem were mostly carried over from ipv4.<p>Blocking 1, 2 (and to some extent 3) on a local network will most likely break ipv6 connectivity entirely while blocking the others will only break it in subtle, hard to debug ways (especially with ECMP and traffic engineering where multiple routes for a given destination can be used).<p>I&#x27;ve found that explaining this before asking network admins to unblock icmpv6 filters is a good way to succeed (although it can be hard, i&#x27;ll give you that).<p>People aren&#x27;t used to filter ARP or link local broadcast in ipv4 (which DHCP uses), so telling them that they need to allow icmpv6 to let stations merely <i>configure</i> themselves is a bit of a mentality change.<p>At the same time, developers of firewall management tools like ufw understood this problem a while ago and insert a working, good, tried and tested icmpv6 accept list as first rule which you can&#x27;t mess with.<p>Telling people to use ufw is usually much better than teaching them ip[6]tables.",1431773631

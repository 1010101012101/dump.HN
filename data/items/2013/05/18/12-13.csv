5728734,story,,,4,2,FreezerburnV,"Ask HN: How should I go about learning Emacs?",,"I've been a VIM user for a decent period of time. I'm not super advanced with motions, end up working in non-VIM environments most of the time, (with VIM bindings, such as with IntelliJ) and vimscript is almost completely unknown to me. And yes, I do know about EVIL mode.<p>But Emacs is something I've looked at over the years, something looks interesting but every time I try to use it I bounce off of it pretty hard. The best I've been able to do is a custom theme with EVIL mode on top of some configuration pack that someone has put together. It was usable, but every so often I would accidentally bump some arcane key combination and nothing would work anymore, or I'd have to put some limited knowledge of Emacs commands together with VIM commands to do something, etc. It just ended up being a pain that I didn't really know how to use, and I would go back to the comfort of VIM, or Sublime Text, IntelliJ, whatever.<p>So that's why I'm asking here: what's the best way for someone who's never really done anything with Emacs (and only limited things with LISPs) to get started, and hopefully not bounce off of it. (though I'll probably still install EVIL mode, because VIM text motions are a thing of beauty)",1368881844

5728726,comment,5728296,5728612,2,0,nnq,,,"Try to thinks about the whole class of editors defined by Textmate, Sublime Text and E-TextEditor. It's mainly about offering all the features of something like Notepad++ (easy to use menus and settings, arbitrary multiple cursors, support for easy to use plugins without touching config files), plus:<p>- offering that unnamed aesthetic quality of ""UX flow"" (ie. try looking form something in Notepad++'s settings panes - Eclipse will seem nice and clean in comparison!)<p>- being cross platform and easily runnable from a memory stick<p>- having what feels like ""no learning curve"" - you can basically move from Eclipse or VS and be productive in Sublime Text from second 0, and achieve enough productivity to actually be in ""coding flow"" after just 1hr spent learning the shortcuts and hunting for needed plugins<p>- following the <i>""don't make me think!"" philosophy</i>: this basically restates the first and the previous points and captures in one sense the ""unnamed quality"" that this class of editors aspires to. I you want to understand ""the zen"" of this, think of the multiple cursors workflow where you'd catr+click 3 different places and start typing and the alternative would be doing a regex-based search and replace on a selection (or a bloody copy paste to the 2nd and 3rd location, I know... but pretend you didn't think of this :) ), but his would actually require you to ""think"" about what you are doing, therefore breaking the ""don't make me think"" philosophy.<p>...all I've said above has many holes, but I understand the appeal of Sublime Text (and I actually use it - it's my favorite tool for editing plain text files, yaml files or html/js/php soup).

5728724,comment,5728248,5728576,2,0,hafabnew,,,"This is almost entirely FUD, and 'the card readers rarely function adequately if at all' is just plain untrue. What makes you say the readers don't work? Personal experience?<p>I've seen a broken screen on a contactless reader once, however I've also seen lots of broken Chip and Pin readers -- doesn't make the system faulty.<p>All contactless systems I've seen are either built-in to the same unit as the Chip and Pin device (which has a display) -- or a separate reader, which also has a display. Both clearly state when payment has been requested, and how much you are being charged. The problem of '[..] or even whether you are paying the bill of the correct till.' is rarely ever a problem at all. With the vast, vast, vast majority of readers, it's instantly obvious which reader you should use (because it's right in front of you!). \nBesides, if it's not immediately 100% obvious which reader you should use, the cashier will point it out to you, but again, this 'problem' is not a regression on chip and pin, which suffers from this.<p>Contactless payment is a hugely popular choice of payment in central London. Take a look at a Pret or Eat (or indeed, M&S) at lunchtime. Consumers aren't in the least bit scared about contactless, nor do they 'express fear'. Everyone I've spoken to about contactless has absolutely loved it. It's unbelievably convenient for consumers and a huge win for businesses too.<p>Agree with the interference though, that is annoying. That said, anyone with any sense doesn't keep their Oyster in their wallet :). Having to hold your wallet out in your hand and place it on the sensor is just asking for someone to grab your wallet (keep oyster in separate pocket during journey, replace during wallet upon arrival at destination).",1368881593

5728718,comment,5728490,5728490,28,0,RyanZAG,,,"I don't see this getting that much traction. Most existing PHP code is heavily dedicated to the use of SQL, and if you don't use the key-value datastore you give up a lot of the scaling advantages of appengine.<p>Secondly, PHP devs and sites are used to very affordable hosting options, and GAE is horribly overpriced for the computing power you get.<p>Thirdly, Google doesn't really seem to care about customers of their AppEngine platform. App Engine Java routinely routes clients to new VMs that are not finished starting up, giving clients 5-15 sec delays on page loads. Google's response to this was to give a lecture at I/O 2013 on how to hard code configurations into your java code [1]. Basically, if you thought Heroku did a poor job of load balancing, Google App Engine takes the cake for terrible load balancing.<p>I really don't know who Google is trying to target with GAE - they seem to be trying to cater to bloggers, small startups, and enterprise all at once. This pretty much just gives everyone the worst of all worlds with bloggers getting a system that is very complex, small startups getting excessive costs as soon as any processing is involved, and enterprise getting a system that will likely fall out from under them in 5-10 years time.<p>[1] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!topic/google-appengine/Nz4Yt8V6PB0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!topic...</a>",1368881422

These are two different things.<p>One is a feature designed to allow them to check URLs, fetch thumbnails, etc. The other is a very pivotal core decision in how Skype works.<p>Skype has always been primarily node-to-node. Doing p2p connections like that required signaling/directory services. In the past, users' computers were used for that functionality. After their purchase, Microsoft transitioned those <i>signaling/directory services</i> to the cloud.<p>At worst, this gives Microsoft the ability to see who is calling who, I'll grant that. Worst case scenario, you can't negotiate via STUN and UDP hole punching or UPnP port forwarding, <i>then</i> you will get stuck with TURN and that will route through Microsoft's servers.<p>So, unless someone has proof of a connection that should have established peer-to-peer and instead <i>the call itself</i> was routed through MS's servers TURN style.... then can we ALL please stop repeating this obnoxious rumor about MS eavesdropping on all Skype calls.

5728674,comment,5728497,5728497,20,0,ericabiz,,,"I can quickly tell you why you've had 0 luck finding a co-founder.<p>My background: I am both a web hosting industry veteran, with a successful high-end hosting company under my belt (see <a href=""http://www.erica.biz/2009/the-end-of-an-era/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erica.biz/2009/the-end-of-an-era/</a> for my story)...and my current co-founder and I also did a presentation at SXSW this year on ""How to Find the Perfect Co-Founder.""<p>You've made 2 classic mistakes here:<p>1) You haven't started building the business without your co-founder.<p>There is absolutely 0 reason why you need a developer co-founder to build what is essentially a high-end hosting company. Put up a WordPress site, set up a Stripe account, collect payment (3 months in advance for new customers will help you buy the server) and you're in business. This is EXACTLY what I did when I started my hosting company. There are many options available to lease high-end hardware (I'm not talking about leasing <i>hosting</i>; I'm talking about leasing the <i>hardware</i> and colocating it) and there's no reason for you to not build and prove out this business.<p>2) You are looking for a co-founder and not a particular skill set. When my co-founder of my current startup and I met in June 2010, I wasn't looking for a co-founder; I was looking for a developer. We worked together for several months and I paid him to develop the site and back-end for our customers. We signed our first customers and only <i>then</i> did I offer him a co-founder position with equity. But I paid him the entire time.<p>Can't afford to pay someone? See my first piece of advice. You don't need anyone else. When I built my hosting company in 2001, I had just started to learn how to write code. I taught myself PHP, wrote my own shopping cart, set up an integration with Payflow Link (now owned by Paypal), and I was in business. You need to do the same thing here.<p>The bottom line is that no one wants equity in an idea. You have to prove the model. Things like WordPress themes and Stripe make it easy to do so, so anyone even remotely technical who doesn't do that doesn't appear to be serious about the business. (I'm not making a judgment call here, but that is the perception when you don't even have a simple website with products for sale and a checkout process before looking for a co-founder.)<p>On top of that, the hosting industry is exceedingly difficult (I've written about it on my blog at <a href=""http://erica.biz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://erica.biz</a> extensively) and you're really going to have to prove that you have something awesome and different to succeed in that business.<p>Think you've got it? Here's the challenge: Get a site up with a checkout process in the next 24 hours. When the first order comes in, put that server on a credit card and deliver to the customer. Then repeat 100x more in the next 6-12 months. You may find you don't need a co-founder, or you may find your business idea was wrong. Either way, you won't be banging your head against the wall saying things like ""I can't move forward without a co-founder!""--you will have taken control of your business and moved forward to prove the idea with the skills you have right now.",1368880190

5728656,comment,5728132,5728132,75,0,davbryn,,,"I pretty much discovered programming by messing around with  my Action Replay as a chid. I was probably 12 years old and my family were poor so we didn't have a computer. My big brother had a Dreamcast and this could be hooked up to our phone line (56K) to get online. I was allowed to do this one hour per week, on a Saturday if I'd been behaved that week. It was terrible: it locked up my mum's phone line so it was a strict hour, and it used to take forever to connect, so I'd get maybe 30 mins to try and load codejunkies.com and post my weekly discoveries to the forum. This was tricky as I had to type using the dreamcast controller and I wrote all my codes out on pen and paper (I had a whole book of my notes).<p>I remember one weekend I got to use the main TV and plugged in the dreamcast. Found the codejunkies forum and there were a bunch of people doing things that I had been doing. Some random names, I remember Dr Ian, FoxDie, SubDrag, Krusha... there were a load of people with strange names doing exactly the same things I'd been doing in the back room during the week.<p>I posted some of the codes I had figured out, nothing major at first: Adding a timer to any Goldeneye level, modifying the character's head/body. I checked back a week later and some of these 'big names' had commented on my codes! I was ecstatic :)<p>I looked forward to my weekly hour online and I used all my time on Action Replay/Gameshark sites. I even wrote a tutorial on N64 hacking (using a Dreamcast controller, it sucked).<p>I got to the stage where I could look at the Memory Editor on a page of Goldeneye and know exactly what part of code/data it was. I knew after a while that 3F80 somehow related to a default value, and if I made it larger things in the game would usually grow. I would change a value like this and them run around for ages until I saw something bigger. Didn't always work, but once it did I would look at the memory address for the 3F80 and do a search for that address.<p>This (I thought at the time) would be the place that knows about the object, so I would read the hexdump and follow anything that looked like an address in the editor, modifying the value at that address and seeing what it would change.<p>Somehow this ended up working out well (I had never used a computer for anything but Word an Excel at this stage) and I found I could replace objects, change their sizes, colour, physics... I could replace them with objects that were no longer in the game (suitcases in Goldeneye etc).<p>It was fun!<p>Once I was comfortable with it I started looking for the big prizes. Things I would see on my weekly journey to the forums that people wanted. Connery Bond was a big one. There were rumours that you could play as the other bonds.<p>So I figured I would find him. I figured that since you pause the game in Goldeneye and see the arm + watch, Connery would have a white arm. So I took some time tracking the seconds hand on the watch and travelled up the memory addresses until I found a value that was near a 3F80. I switched it, paused the game and had a white suit!! Amazing!<p>I ended up quite with an intimate knowledge of the Goldeneye hex dumps. I found a weird level that I could load, providing I emptied it of objects and props. So I found a way to stop the game from loading anything other than level data and I could briefly see a strange silver ramp level with blue skies, but I would fall and die immediately. I later discovered that this was the Citadel level and some other clever guys managed to make it playable :)<p>The thing that ended for me though, was my biggest hack ever...<p>I read a cheat book (I collected N64 magazine) that said Banjo and Kazooie had many more cheats than released while lying on my bed. I figured that I knew a couple of the codes (you entered them in a floor of a sandcastle, but it was basically a keyboard), so if I entered a code and did a memory dump after each letter I could home in on the counter that was checking them.<p>So I hit take a mem dump, hit a letter, mem dump search for values greater than lat and repeat.<p>Found it.<p>Then I search for the memory address at that pointer and find something pointing at it. Repeating this I find a whole bunch of crappy values with 00 between them.<p>Deciding that these were the codes, but encrypted (:-|) I wrote them all down on paper, all 60ish and took them to the front room. From the codes that were released I could figure out the majority of the letters: A was 65, E was 69 etc   so I went through filling those out. I gave my mum and dad a few pages each and (love them) they sat there and filled out the missing letters.<p>An hour later I had every code for that game in my lap :)<p>I waited a few days for internet access and used the entire hour typing them into an email that I sent to Official Nintendo Magazine, GamesMaster and N64 magazine (my favourite).<p>Next week I checked online and Nintendo Magazine got back to me asking where I found the codes. They later published a full cheat book with them (without credit) and credited me for a really crap cheat in the main magazine. I didn't care - they sent me WWF No Mercy for free (big deal for a poor kid) and my name was in a magazine!<p>I was walking home a few weeks later and saw N64 Magazine in the newsagents. Cover had Banjo and Kazooie on it - NEW CHEATS REVEALED: GET THE ICE KEY AND MORE...<p>Holy shit!<p>I couldn't afford it but I ran in and flicked through the pages to look for my name. This was epic!<p>Except it wasn't. Turned out some other hackers had found the codes at the same time and they had their name in my favourite magazine. I was gutted.<p>Two weeks later my parents couldn't afford the phone line and my brother sold his Dreamcast.<p>It was a fun time, and looking back at it now wit a computer science degree I can't help but smile.<p>I only wish I knew what ASCII was before me and my parents used frequency analysis to crack it haha!",1368879763

I also know that some of these color synesthetics have changed over time. For example, I know that the number 2 for me didn't always trigger darkish pink, but I can't remember what it used to be. Also, I have lost synesthesia for G, H, and J, which used to be yellowish, yellowish, and green, but now don't ""do"" anything.<p>If you are experiencing more of a one-to-one idea/color analogue instead of a simple kind of ""association"" between an idea and a color, then what you are describing is highly likely to be similar to what I have, which is word-color synesthesia, the most common form of the ""condition"". For example, it's much more intrinsic than the simple association we normally feel between, say, the word ""money"" and the color green. That's a simple word-color association. When I see the word ""March"", I ""feel/see/experience"" the color blue (and vice versa, though this vice versa is a bit weird because I'm not so good at distinguishing individual colors).",1368878934

The ""input"" is irrelevant as long as it ends up with my thinking of the concept of ""Friday"" or whatever. In the case of foreign languages, foreign word goes in, ""Friday"" idea/color comes to mind. It's also the same if I look at a date on a calendar and see that a certain date is on a Friday, but not with the specific word ""Friday"". Of course, this is the same case for all the other days of the week, numbers, and the few letters. What is also interesting is if the ""input"" is a color very similar to the synesthetic ""color/idea"" for ""Friday"", I will also immediately think of the word/idea for ""Friday"" (in English). So it sort of can go back and forth.<p>Also, I will say that as individual letters or numbers ""disappear"" into a word, I do not get the synesthesia associated. So like ""fourteen thousand"" does not trigger the synesthesia I get for those individual digits, nor does ""Amnesia"" trigger my ""strong"" synesthesia for A, M and N. I hope this makes sense. I'm really trying to describe it as best I can.",1368878411

If you're already going to have a machine at home on 24/7 and you have a fast connection and an IP that doesn't change then it's a great way to get started. Just realize that the cost of your electricity will probably not be so much less than a cheap dedicated server (and probably more than a cheap VPS).<p>If you want to gain some sysadmin knowledge it's probably the single best way to start learning. It's just like having a machine in the shittiest datacenter possible, that just happens to be very conveniently located.",1204356942

126595,comment,126361,126580,0,0,elq,,,"Ah. Well, keep in mind that we're splitting the documents up in an arbitrary way WRT the data, so every cluster/partition has a complete copy of the index for the documents that happen to be bucketed there. And no cluster owns a single ""document class/cluster"".<p>So, if you want to search for, say ""microsoft windows"", the aggregator just sends something like ""PHRASE('microsoft', 'windows')"", each query node finds the document vector/set for microsoft and the document vector for windows and does an intersection of the doc ids, then the node has to do scan that set, grab the document position array from each document and filters out any documents where windows doesn't occur at microsoft-Positions + 1.<p>All of the conjunctions, disjunctions, wildcard expansions, near operations, and phrase operations, etc are executed on the query node. All of the complex sort evaluation also happen on the query node. The aggregator only merges result sets and and performs any necessary global sorting.",1204355344

Here it is:<p>&quot;For me, the hardest thing about functioning in a foreign language was not the long hours it took me to get through a text, not the heightened anxiety, accompanying every social interaction, but the sense of reduced personality that comes with limited verbal expression. For someone who prided herself on writing music criticism for one of the largest Russian newspapers Vedomosti, a branch of The Financial Times, this was a bitter pill to swallow. Even though I communicated perfectly fine, I missed being able to say more with less, to say the same thing in several ways, to express character, not only literal sense.

This means Google alone decides which extensions get published.<p>This is completely untrue. <i>Vivaldi is deciding</i> what extensions get published by intentionally limiting themselves to Google&#x27;s extension repository. There is literally nothing stopping Vivaldi from hosting their own extension repository for extensions that don&#x27;t make it to Google&#x27;s Chrome Web Store. They can also choose to support both repositories, so users can have access to extensions they already use in CWS, in addition to any extensions from Vivaldi&#x27;s repository.<p>The article also states that V8 &quot;has a real community behind it, with less control from Google&quot; as if Blink is more strictly controlled by Google. This is false.<p>V8 and Blink governance are exactly the same. If you want to participate in the community, both projects have public mailing lists where anyone is allowed to put forward rational feedback and ideas regarding functionality and policy. Yes, the final word comes from Google, but there is no governance imbalance between the two projects as implied by this article.",1448740476

10642102,comment,10637789,10641824,0,0,ekiru,,,"I haven&#x27;t been using Perl 6 lately, but, as of a few years ago when I did, some of the more notably unusual features or planned features were:<p>* Grapheme-level string processing, even when there&#x27;s no pre-composed Unicode codepoint for the grapheme. I think Swift is now doing this, too, but I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else is.<p>* Perl 6&#x27;s grammars are to an extension of parsing expression grammars what the regular expressions in Perl 5/Ruby/JavaScript/etc. are to an extension of regular expressions. One can use PEGs (or other grammar formalisms) in any language with a library or code generator, but, with a few exceptions like Parsec, it&#x27;s usually not nearly as convenient.<p>* Roles, similar to the traits concept developed by Nathanael Schärli, Stéphane Ducasse, Oscar Nierstrasz, and Andrew P. Black (and present under that name in e.g. Squeak Smalltalk and PHP since 5.4). Roles/traits are similar to mixin-style multiple inheritance, except that, when including multiple traits with conflicting methods, the including class must explicitly resolve the conflict. Mixin-style systems use an implicit linearized method-resolution order, which is more fragile because newly added methods in earlier mixins can silently override methods of the same name from another mixin that the caller was actually intending to call.<p>* Multiple dispatch is not unique to Perl 6, but it&#x27;s not especially common, and it&#x27;s very convenient.<p>* Configurable object representations. For example, a class can be defined to use the default P6opaque representation, which is I think usually implemented as a pretty standard struct-like representation with properties at fixed offsets. Other possibilities might be a hash table representation, where an object is represented by a hash table and attribute access is done by accessing the values of appropriate keys in the hash table. If one wants to forgo the optimizations allowed by fixed representations, one can even define a class with `is repr(*)` to allow individual objects of the class to be created with different representations.",1448739702

Why isn&#x27;t giving people money (direct to the utility, as we never hand people we help the funds) to get their water turned back on when they&#x27;ve gone for weeks without running water not a good solution? When you encounter someone in that situation, what would you suggest?<p>&quot;Many of the customers get shut off and then immediately pay their bill along with the penalties.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s often true, but what many people (including yourself and, oddly, staff at utilities) don&#x27;t consider is that these people are often robbing Peter to pay Paul. We&#x27;ve got people skimping on medication and food they need in order to keep their utilities on. So, yes, they may pay as soon as the water is shut off, but there&#x27;s often a trade-off.<p>&quot;This is often cyclical with the same people getting shutoff every couple months. Appears to me to be administrative.&quot;<p>This also <i>does</i> happen, but talking to hundreds of families with difficulties paying their water bills, you start seeing patterns. A pattern of multiple shut-offs is usually indicative of some other deeper problem(s). There are people who are between jobs. There are people who&#x27;ve had their hours at work cut. There are people on fixed incomes where even the smallest fluctuation in the water bill (or another bill) can prevent them from paying in full. They pay what they can, but arrearages build up, and next thing you know, service is disconnected.<p>One of the things we&#x27;re going to begin working with Detroit and Baltimore to do better is pick up on these signals and act. Prevention is always better than treatment.<p>Also, if you consider where we work (Detroit and Baltimore), these aren&#x27;t exactly places teeming with amazing employment opportunities for many of the people we serve (the elderly, single parents already juggling multiple jobs, people with minimal education, etc.). Obviously, a stable job is a big part of consistently paying your bills. You can hold all the budgeting classes you want, but good luck getting people there who barely have the funds to keep their families afloat to sign up. Not having enough to make ends meet is not always the result of poor budgeting.<p>And yes, illegal service restoration does have the potential to damage equipment, but when your customers have to resort to that, it&#x27;s indicative that your utility has failed to look after especially vulnerable customers. Detroit is especially odd with respect to indigent customers as they don&#x27;t have a program to assist low-income customers with a discount or the like. Same goes for the elderly.

Think &quot;tormenting implementors on behalf of users&quot;.<p>For example, in Perl 6 a character at the language level is a grapheme. This is per a proper understanding of the Unicode standard. It seems that most folk (and language designers/designs, including eg gvr/py3) don&#x27;t/didn&#x27;t realize that Unicode always intended graphemes as the obligatory ultimate destination for modelling &quot;characters&quot; and providing truly clean Unicode text handling. (Swift has attempted the same thing but their current character iterating implementation and API are clearly inappropriate long term for a performant text manipulation focused language so they&#x27;ll surely have to redo that part of Swift over the coming years.)<p>Another example is the parallelizing, async, and concurrency features in Perl 6. These are all surprisingly simple to use and performant but took a lot of design talent, and engineering talent under the hood, to get right internally and simple externally.<p>Sticking to positive stuff for a moment longer, some features bring important concepts from decades past in to this century. Most notably, afaict, Perl 6 provides a universal unrestricted grammar[1]. Aiui this could put help put &quot;string rewriting&quot;, a relatively neglected mathematically proven isomorphism to the lambda calculus and turing machine models of computation, back on the map. It will be interesting to see what happens as Perl 6 matures.<p>The biggest downside I see, beyond widespread negative associations with the name &#x27;Perl&#x27;, is immaturity. Perl 6 has lots of bugs, poor doc, is currently slow as molasses for a lot of stuff, and so on.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_grammar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_grammar</a>",1448738864

Among other things, at least in the modern US, quite a number of US soldiers are men of lower classes and limited options who are looking at the armed forces as a job with good pay and a good basis for a future career, and the armed forces know that and advertise on that basis. If a draft starts, college students and certain professionals can get deferred; working men age 18-25 get drafted. It is the very nature of income and earning-power inequality in the US that is powering our current enlistment and would be powering any draft. It&#x27;s not really sensible, I think, to argue about whether <i>this</i> equality is needed when the very reason the situation exists is itself a fairly major inequality.<p>That said, women&#x27;s groups have historically supported extending the draft to women.

I would argue it was sure inconvenient for paint companies but a net gain to society. Perhaps some level of funding should be given to these companies as we take their rights away - and perhaps not, depending on how foreseeable and expensive their issues were - but the fact is, sometimes we as a society need to force them to make changes.<p>To my mind, it&#x27;s not redistribution because the point is not to take their income away, the point is that it&#x27;s time to stop. Yes, that will have an effect on their income. Not doing it will have a much higher dollar cost, and the company won&#x27;t pay it directly but the country sure will.",1448738060

Many of the customers get shut off and then immediately pay their bill along with the penalties (approx 3/4). This is often cyclical with the same people getting shutoff every couple months. Appears to me to be administrative. Should have financial people show them how to budget or organize their bills to prevent getting the fees so it doesn&#x27;t happen again in the long run. Another thing the article points to is a $250 fee for turning on the water. Often when the water is turned on without authorization the utility equipment is damaged. The fix can involve calling out trade workers to saw out parts of streets and sidewalks and replacing expensive brass lead-free parts. $250 would be in the neighborhood of the cost.",1448737885

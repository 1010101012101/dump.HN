Went back to the site and <i>still</i> it took 30 seconds of hunting (and another minute to notice the one up top in the little bubble).  Nobody off the street will give you that much time.  I'd make it as big a priority on the homepage as ""sign up"".<p>And speaking of which, the biggest glaring issue with your site is that the ""Support"" link doesn't go to one of your own feedback sites.  Why are you not using your own product?  As a potential customer, the immediate answer that springs to mind is ""because it's not good enough"", and that's the last you'll see of me.",1276250725

Differences so far: the tutorial has you use RSpec 1 for testing, but RSpec 2 (prerelease) is required for Rails 3. Also, routing is completely different in Rails 3, which shows up early on (when you create a new static page without autogenerating it) and then later in the routing section. Then there's the minor matter of using ""rails generate"" and ""rails server"" instead of ""script/server"" and ""script/generate"".",1276250683

I was ready to go volunteer as a civilian in South Korea to help a war effort if it came to that - I think the vast majority of the United States' wars in recent history have been poorly chosen, poorly executed, and morally questionable.<p>But the United States Government not taking out Communist China and Kim Sung-il's North Korea during the Korean War has to be one of the largest war mistakes in history. So much misery could have been avoided if they'd done it the way Chiang Kai-shek wanted and pushed through Korea into China. The Communists got a huge boost from seizing the Imperial Japanese weapons after WWII, but they were still far underequipped compared to the U.N. forces in South Korea. Then the Soviets got nuclear weapons and the stand-still happened, and lots of people suffered for it.<p>North Korea has to be one of the most vicious places in the world. I'd sign up pretty quickly if an international coalition went to tear down its government.",1276250502

He tried to affect change in a different way. Not by anger which we all feel after reading the article. You have to admire his determination. 
Immediate changes or changes caused by outside interference may not be a lasting or stable thing.
I believe at some point in time, the idiots ruling the place will want to follow their only friend, China, transformation. The question is when. Any form of aggression is only going to cost extra lives and delay this timetable. As for them making the first move in a war....hmm...US can vaporize the whole north peninsula and still have left over nukes.",1276250485

4401290,comment,4401018,4401228,6,0,malay,,,"There was significantly more behind the scenes. It would be very similar to what PwC just paid for (rebranding from PriceWaterhouseCoopers) [1].<p>Accenture was a rebrand of Andersen Consulting, the consulting division of Arthur Andersen, the large accountancy. The Big-5 accountancy gave them their entire brand position, so the creation of the Accenture logo involved all of the campaigns for them to emerge, not just the logo or mark. This is also why their ads are in every airportthe brand identify had to be built from scratch. For Accenture, it ended up being exceptional timing, considering the Enron scandal would emerge in a year or so and end up destroying Arthur Andersen.<p>Most of the accountancies examined spinning out their consulting divisions, similar to Accenture. I wouldn't say the results were as successful as Accenture for those that chose to rebrand. E&Y sold their group to Cap Gemini, becoming Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, and eventually just Capgemini. PwC was going to spin out their division as ""Monday"", but instead ended up selling the group to IBM (only to eventually restart again). KPMG had BearingPoint, which eventually went bankrupt. Deloitte contemplated rebranding their consulting group as Braxton, but it never happened.<p>All in all, seems like the $100M was worth it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662367/pwcs-mighty-morphin-logo-adapts-to-web-print-and-beyond-video"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662367/pwcs-mighty-morphin-logo...</a>",1345301987

They dodged a bullet, and all he could call it was ""unsatisfactory.""<p>I'm not asking NASA to be full of raving loons. But show some goddamn emotion from time to time!

I have no doubt that by showing themselves as fully human, these amazing people just created a whole new generation of kids who will dream of sending probes to faraway places like Europa, Titan, and beyond.<p>Bottom line: I admire Mr. Hale's honesty in hindsight.

They are musicians and entertainers, many with punk roots (Madonna was NY Downtown, which is close enough), some who have been attacked by governments for social statements in their works using ""traumatized"" members of the public as a proxy. Pussy Riot is a band.<p>If you're not talking about Madonna, Sting, or any of the musicians that have been keeping this stuff in the news, who are you talking about? Me? It bugs me because the Church, an autocratic regime, and the Russian judicial system have merged to a point where they aren't even tolerating the existence of even trivial, fairly-vapid, middle-class, artsy dissent from a renewed nationalist program - and don't even have the shame to do it in secret, because they feel that enough of the public is behind them that they'll get away with it.<p>That's scary, and doesn't bode well for the future. It certainly doesn't even get into the ballpark of bugging me as much as Guantanamo. Guantanamo is happening in my country, and is a trampling on of my rights, and my constitution.<p>Why is it different from striking miners being murdered in South Africa? Because the striking miners weren't gunned down in a courtroom, after months of deliberation, with the support of the majority of the South African public, maybe? Maybe because the aggression of the state in support of capitol against striking workers is a known, and common evil? Maybe because the victims were black working men, not pretty middle-class white women involved in entertainment?<p>Asking how people can be more concerned about one than the other at this moment seems intentionally obtuse. Some people don't care at all about Pussy Riot, some don't care at all about the miners, some care about both, some care about neither, but the range of completely different concerns raised by each of those situations could be enumerated all day without hint of exhaustion.",1345299325

I understand that you're meaning to be hyperbolic, but ""timeless pice (sic) of crap"" is rather silly.<p>For me, it is like switching to a mechanical keyboard.  A Filco is heavy, ugly, and loud - until you actually start using one.  As much as one's fingers ""fly on that glass"", it doesn't eliminate the problem of removing your fingers from the keyboard.  For many people, the ability to keep their fingers where they want them and still navigate a page smoothly makes the best trackpad in the world a wasted rectangle that clutters the bottom of their laptop.",1345298844

As someone who's been a heavy user of both databases in the past, IMO the only thing MySQL has done better than PostgreSQL is in the marketing department. PostgreSQL has no concerted marketing effort. PostgreSQL is not a company with a marketing budget...it's a community of peers and db geeks getting things done.",1345298833

Putin has been covered by all major channels in Russia exclusively for last 12 years, every single day. It's also not possible technically because he made a mockery of the elections process, and even then had to rig the vote. You also know that your claim about his popularity among Russians outside of Moscow is bogus but hardly verifiable to most people on HN: but he's just as disliked there as he is in Moscow. Don't portray Russian people as fools: they are not. And your talk about things not being so simple: how familiar. They are simple, my friend: Putin violated Russia's own laws including the Constitution, when he ran for the 3rd time, and he should not be the president, no matter how big you think his popularity is. He wants to rule forever? He will end up as a dictator. Simple as that.",1345298706

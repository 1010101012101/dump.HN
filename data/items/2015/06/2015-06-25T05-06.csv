I wanted to make games, start a business, or make cool apps. Now I spend 9 hours a day in an &quot;enterprise&quot; role resetting passwords and writing trivial backend code for third party apps.<p>I&#x27;m a night owl, but I get up every day at the crack of dawn, and I&#x27;m too exhausted almost every evening to be social or work on side project ideas. I have a project at home that I really believe in, but with my exhaustion in the evenings and life&#x27;s endless distractions filling my time in one way or another, it&#x27;s been over a month since I really got in the &quot;zone&quot; for a few hours working on it.<p>I went to a shitty school, so now I try to study algorithms and other fancy whiteboard interview-esque things I need to know (and didn&#x27;t get a solid foundation on) if I ever want one of those fancier developer jobs at a company with 21st century environment, policies, etc. It gets so tiring to forgo time with family and friends to study in your spare time and write cover letters to places you&#x27;ll never hear back from. And I live in a small town that I want to move from, how am I supposed to take enough time off unnoticed to do any meaningful amount of phone calls and in-person interviews?<p>At the end of the day, it&#x27;s easier to play a few games of Halo, go to bed, and say you&#x27;ll get a little closer to somewhere you want to be tomorrow.

The original file data in the Dropbox is not corrupted; it is only the PDF presented in the web browser (to the user with whom you shared the data) that is corrupted.<p>What happens is, when you share a PDF file via link, instead of presenting the actual PDF file in the browser (which would work fine) Dropbox instead presents its own PDF viewer inside the web browser and shows the file.<p>This &quot;PDF view&quot; has problems with many PDF documents containing Japanese text, and either doesn&#x27;t render the Japanese, or renders bogus data instead.<p>Depending on the contents of the document, this can result in it looking like gibberish, but it can also result in a document that looks correct to the recipient but is actually totally wrong.<p>For instance, one real-world case was a document with a long list of work items for a project. The items happened to be in English, and in Japanese many of them said &#x27;CANCELED&#x27; （中止）in the right-hand column.<p>The Dropbox PDF viewer failed to render only the Japanese in the right hand column, so to the recipient it looked like e.g. a list of 100 work items, when in fact the point of the document was to communicate that 60 of the 100 items had been cancelled.<p>In this case, there was no hint at all to the recipient that there was anything amiss.<p>It&#x27;s a bad bug, and dramatically reduced the utility of Dropbox for our company.

One thing businesses are constantly telling me: &quot;We are flooded by unsuitable candidates, because recruiters are playing the numbers game. Their strategy is submitting large lists of candidates in the hope that one or two are suitable.&quot;<p>The status quo has evolved because employees don&#x27;t feel qualified, or like they have the resources, to conduct an initial candidate search. They don&#x27;t think they have the networks, but they need a new hire fast. So they outsource to &#x27;experts&#x27;, but the incentive is all wrong.<p>Good luck to you.

9776170,comment,9774144,9775348,0,0,developer1,,,"For the typical larger project, you&#x27;d wind up with hundreds of indexes each used by a single application query. The optimal index arrangement for a database often does not result in all columns being indexed on a query. It&#x27;s normal and desirable (for index size and performance) to have fewer indexes that may only partially cover your queries. For example, a query with a WHERE of &quot;a AND b AND c&quot; is more often than not better handled with an index on (a) or (a, b) rather than (a, b, c). Especially if you have a second query with &quot;a AND b AND d&quot;, you&#x27;re most likely going to wind up with a single index for (a, b) rather than one for (a, b, c) and another for (a, b, d).<p>What could be useful would be a generated report for all your queries with possible suggestions, grouping together queries with the same partial prefix columns, and the cardinality that each index would result in. Then one could manually review to look for the most significant improvements possible. I think a fully automated attempt (even built-in heuristics that modified indexes over time) would sometimes result in a bad decision being made that could theoretically crash your application. Perhaps with a few years of perfecting a solution this could become the norm. :)",1435210985

It doesn&#x27;t seem to take much time at all for people to adjust between a tiller and a wheel, or standing behind or in front of a wheel. I think a lot of that has to do with sensing that force is needed to keep from rounding up into the wind. Possibly, having a rudder well forward of the mast would change that, which makes me think that it is also the immediacy of failure that makes it difficult to learn.<p>Anyway, if it were a useful skill, I think learning how to handle reversing handle bars could be made faster with two changes. A longer, more forward front wheel fork, would make the amount of force more apparent to the rider. Second, much larger wheels would be slower to react with failure, so the rider gets a few extra fractions of a second  to learn how to react.",1435210954

I was interfacing with libaxolotl-java and basically rebuilding libtextsecure in Clojure (that was months ago).<p>Yesterday, when I discovered libtextsecure-java (while exploring Github repositories, by the way, I didn&#x27;t notice your website had been updated in the meantime), I started a rewrite, using README as my primary source of documentation (the only piece of doc I could find, actually).<p>Ok, so what&#x27;s this `KeyHelper`? Ok, I&#x27;ll search on Github. Fine, it&#x27;s actually `org.whispersystems.libaxolotl.util.KeyHelper` - luckily I knew it was in a <i>completely different project</i>. The same goes for `AxolotlStore`, which is actually `org.whispersystems.libaxolotl.state.AxolotlStore`, and it&#x27;s not even mentioned on libaxolotl-java README because the latter is outdated.<p>Then: what is `TrustStore`? Good luck finding out that! Basically it is a wrapper around a <i>binary file</i> - which I had to download from TextSecure source repo <i>without knowing what there was inside</i>, and which by the way is encrypted with the password <i>whisper</i> (documentation: nowhere - thank you @AsamK for your textsecure-cli sources on github).<p>Ok, and finally figuring out - turning to TextSecure-Server docs - what is a <i>signaling key</i>, what are the specifics for the client-generated password (which by the way is sent over SSL via Basic authentication - probably not the most secure method ever, but probably there are many reason for that) and what is an <i>install ID</i>, I finally had the opportunity to debug obscure security problems on Java and to meet in person a Fedora bug <a href=""https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1167153"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1167153</a>). Not to mention the fact that <i>apparently</i> libtextsecure-java doesn&#x27;t work over websockets but only over GCM (<a href=""https://github.com/WhisperSystems/libtextsecure-java/pull/5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/WhisperSystems/libtextsecure-java/pull/5</a>) - however I won&#x27;t be surprised if it did.<p>A really nightmarish experience.

YC&#x27;s boilerplate options plans included share transfer restrictions and made early exercise (83b elections) out to be the bogeyman. Almost every YC company has the same option plan because of PG&#x27;s tutelage. People copied these plans because &quot;hey it&#x27;s what YC does.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s be perfectly frank and talk about the facts here:<p>1) There is zero cost to the company to allowing 83b elections. All it does is remove the possibility of golden handcuffs (which are very effective when a new unicorn is minted every week).<p>2) There is no more &quot;500 shareholder rule&quot; after the JOBS act. It removed that. There is no penalty for having lots of shareholders -- especially when most stock transferred has no voting rights and no disclosure rights. Facebook &quot;paid the price&quot; for having lots of shareholders but in reality they did not. GS&#x27;s investor vehicle took care of that. Facebook was not &quot;forced&quot; to go public. They went public at an incredibly old age as far as growth companies go.<p>3) There&#x27;s an almost non-zero cost to have another company (like SecondMarket) handle share registration and transfers. It&#x27;s not a huge overhead. Consider it your Nerf ammunition cost for the quarter.<p>4) The state of current stock option agreements is not to help you the employee. It&#x27;s for the benefit of the company. Option agreements in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s did grow out of an altruistic &quot;hey we&#x27;re all in this together&quot; theme.

There&#x27;s no timeline specified in the option agreement. You must offer them right of first refusal, but there&#x27;s no mention of timeliness.

Linked lists are great for small lists, where you want very little memory overhead and you care more about each operation taking a pretty small, consistent amount of time.<p>Vectors/Arrays are great when you don&#x27;t care as much about the total memory consumption, but you want to reduce the amount of heap fragmentation.<p>A downside to using arrays like this, and likely a leading reason you don&#x27;t see them used that much in the linux kernel is that every once and a while an insert is going to force a realloc which takes a relatively long time. std::vector and the like mitigate this by reserving more space than they&#x27;ll need and so they minimize the # of reallocs required.<p>There is also performance implications to doing std::vector<myStruct> vs std::vector<myStruct*>. The later can very easily mimic the same cache coherence issues that happen with a linked list of myStructs.<p>So when we are talking about speed in terms of millions of items in some data crunching program, vector is almost always going to win out.

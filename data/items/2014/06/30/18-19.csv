7966881,comment,7965953,7966587,5,0,xxxargs,,,"^^^ This information is incorrect.<p>1) &quot;A lot of women have painful allergic reactions to the copper ones&quot; -- No. Copper allergies are rare and occur in less than 1% of the population, according to the FDA. If you suspect you have a copper allergy or are sensitive, you can do a simple patch-test on your arm before considering a copper IUD to check for copper reaction.<p>2) [IUDs] &quot;have a bad history of getting lodged in the wrong places and having to be surgically removed&quot; -- Also wrong. The most common occurrence of perforation is during insertion, and even then perforations during insertion happen in less than 0.001% of cases. I would not consider this a &quot;bad history&quot; or common occurrence.<p>SOURCE: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUD_with_copper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUD_with_copper</a> & I have a hormonal IUD currently and have had copper before.<p>Your information about IUDs is over 50 years old, and is based on the copper &quot;coil&quot; IUD which hasn&#x27;t been in use for decades. Current IUDs (both hormonal and copper) are extremely safe, effective, and perhaps the most error-proof and reliable form of birth control out there. The largest risk with an IUD is rejection, where your device falls out -- the solution is simple, it&#x27;s just reinserted. The largest barrier to getting IUDs is the belief in the US that you need to have had children first, to have a cervix wide enough to tolerate insertion. This is also untrue. You can have an IUD at any time in your life, insertion is just much more painful if you haven&#x27;t had children.<p>Additionally, you don&#x27;t need to scan a woman&#x27;s womb before having sex to confirm she has an IUD. You can usually feel the strings from the IUD (there for easy removal) at the top of the cervix, with your fingertips. And if you&#x27;re a man worth half his salt, you&#x27;ll have had the opportunity to... check that out before having sex with her ;)",1404154775

I personally feel these funds are waiting for a US corporate income tax holiday, perhaps under the guise of creating new jobs and investment domestically.

7966847,comment,7966680,7966680,9,0,api,,,"I have gradually become convinced by mountains of evidence from many quarters that the Keynesians are right-- we are in a demand constrained economy.<p>One of the problems I think is that economists and politicos tend to always be fighting the last war. In the late 1970s to early 1980s -- the last time the economy seemed this systemically bleak -- the problem was insufficient capital available for investment combined with high inflation. This resulted in &quot;stagflation,&quot; something classical Keynesians thought impossible, and thus resulted in a widespread discrediting of classical Keynesian and economic liberal thought.<p>Thing is... in the late 70s the supply siders may well have been right and the Keynesians wrong. We were in a supply limited economy, and stimulus and other liberal policies just made everything inflate.<p>But now I think the situation has reversed. Today looks a lot more like the 1930s, albeit not quite as viscerally nasty. There&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> amount of capital available but few good investments. Wages are stagnant, savings are down, pay and wealth inequality are utterly massive, etc.<p>So today I think the Keynesians may well be right again. Hopefully it&#x27;ll come in the form of something less destructive than a war. I&#x27;d personally suggest a massive program to electrify all transport, huge investments in both renewable energy and next-generation nuclear power, a medical &quot;war on aging,&quot; and a campaign to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars. All that taken together would probably end up costing about what WWII did, and so might be enough. The war on aging would have the added follow-on benefit of helping with our demographic problems. (As would a more liberal immigration policy.)<p>Meta question: perhaps there&#x27;s a new insight here... do modern industrial economies actually tend to oscillate between demand constrained and supply constrained failure modes? Perhaps the Keynesians overcorrected for the great depression, resulting in the 1970s, and now the supply siders have overcorrected for the 1970s resulting in today. In that case maybe we oscillate between periods when Keynesian demand-side policies work and periods when Friedman-esque supply-side policies work.<p>Edit: the reason I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re hurting as bad at the street level today as we were at the depths of the Great Depression is simply because we&#x27;ve grown so far beyond subsistence level. Today the amount of economic pain required to cause visceral physical pain among large numbers of people in the developed world -- starvation, etc. -- would be quite a bit larger than what it took in the 30s. To lead to that kind of thing we&#x27;d need the 2008 financial crash times ten at least, combined with a major political collapse and some kind of technological train wreck. A mega-sized solar flare or a sudden &quot;oh crap&quot; worst case peak oil cliff coming to pass might do it.<p>But compared to a non-slump timeline -- compared to what <i>should</i> be happening given the technological growth we&#x27;ve experienced -- we are in a depression. We should be colonizing Mars, conquering aging, pretty much doing all the things I suggested as stimulus. Instead we are building apps like Yo while people go bankrupt in underwater houses with underwater student loans. (Not blaming the authors of Yo either... during the depression a lot of people took up whittling sticks and other little time-passing pursuits for lack of good work to do.)",1404154563

7966809,comment,7965844,7966645,5,0,abruzzi,,,"I&#x27;ve frequently heard the idea bounced around that self driving cars will eliminate the need for ownership.  I&#x27;m glad you mentioned taxis, because it brings up something that has bugged me about this idea for a while. I live in a metro area of 200,000. This metro area has exactly zero taxis. (We do have a free ride services that is funded by the local city for getting the elderly and disabled around, which probably has six cars.) The three reasons are size density and wealth.  As density goes down, mileage to get from point A to point B goes up, which means costs go up.  It also means that cars are potentially occupied for longer periods, so you would likely need more cars to service the same population in denser areas. So ultimately taxis are not economically feasible here.  So because you don&#x27;t have to hire drivers, those costs go down and potentially lower the barrier to entry, but you have potentially more expensive vehicles, and higher maintenance costs that may somewhat offset the savings.  So you could charge more for the service here, but being a poor city, would anyone here pay the extra costs?  Enough to sustain the business model?  Or will we have to suffer with significantly worse service--wait an hour to get picked up.  I&#x27;m sure the business model would work in SF, NYC, Chicago, but here it will have to come down a lot in cost.  Also (to the parent poster,) I just see the possibility that a migration like this could take place within 25 years just ludicrous.",1404154244

I&#x27;ve never used Akka.<p>Go is not in the same class as Erlang when it comes to Cloud Computing.  In Erlang the state and behavior of your entire datacenter can be contained in Erlang itself.  Erlang will take care of bringing up new processes when your jobs break. Erlang will handle messaging between processes executing on different machines.<p>Go doesn&#x27;t do any of that out of the box.  There are some interesting projects like Go Circuit, which sort of kinda want to emulate Erlang&#x27;s OTP and bring your datacenter behavior into Go, but Go Circuit isn&#x27;t being run in production by anyone I have heard of.  Maybe its ready to go, but it looks more like a research project to me.<p>As such, Go has nothing to do with managing a cluster other than that it gives you some nice single node concurrency features.  You will need to build or import everything else you need.<p>I can&#x27;t think of anything else out there which is quite like Erlang/OTP.  Maybe Julia has some tools that are similar but I don&#x27;t know too much about it.<p>Edit:  For those Go programmers that are interested in what I&#x27;m talking about, check out this concise explanation from the Erlang docs:\n<a href=""http://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/conc_prog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/conc_prog.html</a><p>Erlang isn&#x27;t as user friendly as Go, but it has a lot of stuff that can save you serious headaches if you think you will need to scale.

If you use real money, i.e. gold or silver.<p>Since most people would disagree that gold and silver are real money, the burden of proof is on your side. I think an equally compelling explanation for your observations can be built from the premise that gold in particular has been inflating an speculative bubble during the same time frame of 50+ years (or more precisely, that since about the 2nd half of 20 century gold price had been recovering from a previous drop in historic prices, and that a bubble has formed around that pattern and just began to inflate about ~10 years ago).<p>If on the other hand you consider the fact that petrol is a finite resource, and that the challenges to build a flying device powered by either nuclear energy, solar, wind or hydro, it is very likely that tourist class aviation will be in permanent decay from now on.<p>I think the capacity to fly is extremely valuable, so it will be preserved by nation states for as long as possible, mainly for military purposes, but also for the rapid transportation of diplomats and other high ranking officials. And if the technical capacity of flying is preserved in any way, the upper layers of civil society will find a way to buy their ways in as well (bringing back the original meaning of the term &quot;jet set&quot; as a side effect).

The mix up is caused by photon where both have the same wavelength. They are different in the case of all other particles. Hitachi experiment shows its the best - it clearly shows interference of the positional waves of different particles, not the de Brogile wave (ie. not the particles themselves). It thus also lends very credible support to statistical ensemble interpretation (which, as far as i know, Einstein favored)<p>People frequently bring up single-particle self-interference as explanation for Hitachi too. Well, in case of photon the self-interference pattern looks the same as positional interference because of the same wavelength. In case of electron and especially neutron the self-interference pattern would be much more dense than observed one because of the much higher de Brogile frequency than the frequency of the positional quantization.<p>The wave-like quantization of position is the Pivot Wave. The really important thing here is to understand that Pivot Wave isn&#x27;t a real wave/object. It is just a description of possible positions of the particle at specific times. Like a trajectory of a bullet isn&#x27;t a real thing, it is just description of possible positions of the bullet at specific times. It is just in QM the trajectories are wave-like quantized and probabilistically spread - that the non-smooth at small scales structure  of our Universe shows its &quot;ugly&quot; face :)<p>Again, taking the quantized wave-like trajectory description of a particle for a real thing, the particle itself, is the main misinterpretation that has been going for years, especially in Copenghagen interpretation.",1404153750

The code above is passing two of them at once.</i><p>Shoehorning things from different realms (e.g desperately trying to write JS in Ruby or vice-versa) is not a good idea.<p>Instead of either:<p><pre><code>    db.select_one(sql, thingid)\n        .then((proc {|rowset| rowset[0][&#x27;foo&#x27;}), (proc {|err| log_error(err)}))\n</code></pre>\nor:<p><pre><code>    db.select_one(sql, thingid)\n        .then {|rowset| rowset[0][&#x27;foo&#x27;}\n        .then(nil) {|err| log_error(err)}\n</code></pre>\nWhy not do:<p><pre><code>    db.select_one(sql, thingid)\n        .then {|rowset| rowset[0][&#x27;foo&#x27;}\n        .else {|err| log_error(err)}\n        .each {|whatever| the_progress(callback_is)}\n</code></pre>\nAlso, <i>method(:log_error)</i> will happily turn the method into a proc.<p>This last case is actually extremely important. Contrary to what the author claims, functions and methods <i>are</i> first class in Ruby. The problem is that in Ruby&#x27;s grammar an identifier without parentheses is a method call if that identifier does not resolve to a variable. Therefore, you cannot refer to an existing function by its name, merely because it would resolve to a call.<p>Therefore the difference between those is <i>purely syntactic</i>:<p><pre><code>    Python  Ruby\n    foo     method(:foo)\n    foo()   foo\n</code></pre>\nAlso, this[0] explains how <i>&:to_i</i> works, which can be leveraged with great success, should one implement the promise class in a sufficiently idiomatic way (turning the above <i>log_error</i> reference into &:log_error)<p>[0]: <a href=""http://ablogaboutcode.com/2012/01/04/the-ampersand-operator-in-ruby/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ablogaboutcode.com/2012/01/04/the-ampersand-operator-...</a>",1404153679

7966714,comment,7966247,7966247,7,0,andrew_null,,,"There&#x27;s a few points which sound right in this essay, but I&#x27;m surprised he didn&#x27;t discuss the more technical definition and its impact on the ecosystem:<p>1) an angel investor is someone who invests their own money\n2) a venture capitalist invests out of a fund, which is mostly other peoples&#x27; money (OPM!) while taking a fee + economics from the fund (the famous &quot;2 and 20&quot; model)<p>But that&#x27;s not too useful, because what&#x27;s important are the behaviors that come out of the situation.<p>Because most angels are investing their own money, they usually don&#x27;t have crazy amounts of capital to work with. Thus, they usually invest early so they can get a better percentage at a lower valuation.<p>Many VCs also invest early, sometimes exclusively so with smaller funds, but they are often called &quot;seed funds&quot; to make that distinction. A fund which invests OPM is never called an &quot;angel&quot; regardless of what stage they invest at.<p>And finally, big funds (managing 100s of millions of dollars) are what we think of usually as venture capital.<p>(Funds that invest even larger amounts at higher valuations are often referred to as &quot;late stage venture capital&quot; or &quot;growth capital.&quot; And there&#x27;s more specialized terminology later stage since more specialized financial instruments can be brought into play - SPVs/debt/mezzanine/etc)<p>Where Scott&#x27;s essay rings true is that idea that investors of all classes are more risk averse these days- they prefer to see traction since the cost of building an app/website is rapidly decreasing. Thus, they are all behaviorally acting like &quot;traction investors&quot; rather than &quot;idea investors&quot; whereas in the past, traction investors purely consisted of the growth capital guys.<p>This might be worse for the ecosystem since people want you to have everything built before taking in our first dollar of investment, but you could argue it means the ecosystem&#x27;s $s are being allocated more efficiently also.",1404153275

Combining these two gives us 5.4% of ticket cost on a full airliner is weight marginal fuel cost.<p>Extracting 5.4% of the ticket price and making it pay-by-weight (or, rather, by the proportion of the total margin weight you make up) seems fair. On the other hand, 5.4% is a pretty small number compared to the other costs associated with &quot;pay by weight&quot;. Lots of people would be, justifiably or not, angry about paying more because they are fatter, taller, or not a child even if that is only a few dollars per hundred on the ticket price.<p>On the other hand, as a tall person I would strongly support being able to pay marginally more for more legroom.

Conclusive, no. It is interesting that engines dramatically improved after these patents expired.<p>Another thing that the &quot;Strong Steam, Weak Patents, or, \nthe Myth of Watt‚Äüs Innovation-Blocking Monopoly, Exploded*&quot; paper detailed was the extraordinary effort that the inventors spent on the legal process. Wouldn&#x27;t their energy be best served on their core competency, which is invention? Wouldn&#x27;t society benefit more from inventors inventing instead of dealing with legal issues? I&#x27;ve heard of stories where inventors spent years bitterly defending their patents.<p>Patent bring innovation into the domain of the legal profession & business administration. Innovation, in it&#x27;s purest form, is in the domain of the creator (inventor).<p>> As for a fear of creating a product due to patents, I&#x27;m not sure this is a widespread phenomenon.<p>Having to hire a patent attorney counts as fear. It&#x27;s certainly an expense & extra administration to creating an innovative product. I&#x27;ve never seen a programmer, or engineer, peruse the patent database to find ideas on solving the problem. Most of the time, the problem is identified, and solutions are proposed & explored.<p>The fear of being litigated preventing you from creating is akin to the fear of killed in a car accident preventing you seeing your family. We still proceed, but we make every effort to make driving as safe as possible. Ideally, driving would be 100% safe. Ideally, creating would be 100% safe from litigation.<p>> Of course, my sample is extremely small and this is anecdotal, but all the people I know doing their own startups are either indifferent to, or actually bullish on, patents.<p>I also work with startups that have patents. It&#x27;s almost a requirement to have a patent for &quot;defensibility&quot;. If this requirement went away, the game would change. I suspect, more emphasis would be put on how well the organization can execute & innovate.<p>> And this is why we need more empirical studies, because anecdotes and experiences don&#x27;t add up to data.<p>It&#x27;s good to have both. Sometimes studies can be an exercise of local optimization at the expense of global optimization. Anecdotes are a great way to disseminating wisdom to take action.<p>>  But it&#x27;s not an easy topic, given that even the basic concept of &quot;innovation&quot; is hard to define and almost impossible to measure.<p>Agreed. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s usually better to err on the side of simplicity. Facts are less obfuscated and the waters are less muddied.<p>I personally think novelty, untied to economic output, is a better measure. Novelty is easier to define & it is more difficult to redefine by parties interested in promoting an agenda.<p>---<p>As a whole, there are only analogous environments and motivations. As a creator, I favor independence. I don&#x27;t want large amounts of capital & business administration to be a requirement for me to make a living creating things. I want autonomy without having to spending my time in court. I want to have the freedom to create derivative works. I want to have the freedom to invent without having to get a patent or making sure I don&#x27;t infringe on somebody&#x27;s patent.<p>If someone create a derivative work from my work, then I&#x27;m happy.

For example, where Python has &#x27;hardcoded&#x27; generator expressions, a Ruby developer can leverage blocks to make his own generators. The same goes for features such as <i>with</i>, which are syntactically defined in Python, but which are customary to simply implement with blocks in Ruby.

You throw a lot of power into going LALALALALALALALA at the frequency bands you expect the devices you want to jam to be interacting at, then they can&#x27;t hear each other over you. It&#x27;s actually not a particularly hard engineering problem until you start worrying about heat and efficiency - you just build a transmitter and broadcast noise at high power.<p>Blocking (passive):<p>Use a Faraday cage or sheer mass to prevent signals from being broadcast into or out of an enclosed area. Mass attenuates signals depending on thickness, density, and frequency. A Faraday cage uses a powered metal mesh to maintain constant voltage at a surface, which can kill most transmissions without the need to turn your building into a bunker.<p>But assuming this is actually allowed by your local laws, you still shouldn&#x27;t do it. It&#x27;s hazardous and unethical since it will also disrupt e.g. emergency communications. If you&#x27;re bothered by impolite cell phone use, you should pursue a social remedy which allows for extreme cases where manners are not the biggest concern, rather than a technical one which is blind to significant edge cases.<p>For military applications:<p>You don&#x27;t have an enclosed area to work with, so you mostly use jamming devices with as much power as you can manage. But this gets used less than you might think from Hollywood, since a major cost of using them is that you&#x27;re very loudly shouting your general position to anyone who cares about that and access to some basic electronics. Also the really good ones are set up as buildings or vehicles, it&#x27;s not going to be small if you want power on the order of &quot;shout so loud a civilian radio station can&#x27;t hear itself think.&quot;<p>Passive compliments:<p>Anti-radar stealth technology, which is where you try to make yourself as much of a pain in the ass to make out clearly as you can manage. This is far more difficult since you don&#x27;t have a controlled environment to play with, but there&#x27;s still a lot you can do with clever shapes and surface design. Also the point is less to make yourself invisible, than it is to reduce the amount of advance warning that an opponent would get, or their ability to respond to changes in your vector.<p>Chaff countermeasures are easier, you basically launch a bunch of stuff that&#x27;s highly reflective at the frequencies people are trying to track you with. I think this is mostly an air-to-air thing.

7966540,comment,7965942,7965942,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That was Awesome! First lets have a look at his points in the context of 8 years later, what happened?<p>#1 This author misses that house fundamentals in the bay area are tied to wealth generation, not income levels. A place like Facebook goes public and several thousand people are in a position to buy a million dollar house for cash. Depending on who you ask Google pays their top performing engineers in option adjusted terms between $300 and $400K/year.<p>#2 Interest rates are a function of economic activity, a crappy economy and you get low interest rates. At least now the Fed has stopped &quot;promising&quot; to keep them low.<p>#3 Adjustable rate loans can force the unprepared to sell their houses, that has always been true.<p>#4 The &#x27;massive job loss&#x27; has been completely eradicated, the bay area is employing more people than it did in 2000.<p>#5 The salary declines must not be in tech, it used to be you had to be management to make $100K now you just need to be a senior engineer.<p>#6 The population loss from the dot com bust exodus was pretty impressive, but its also history.[1]<p>#7 The stock market has recovered, the NASDAQ had been adjusted, its over 4400 today.<p>#8 The leverage argument I didn&#x27;t get. If you own a house you can&#x27;t pay for you aren&#x27;t &quot;bankrupt&quot; you are &quot;out of a house&quot; (that is the thing about secured no-recourse loans) and that sucks, but its not the end of the world. Lately prices have been crazy again.<p>#9 Shortage of first time buyers. The weird thing is that <i>somebody</i> is buying those houses. A lot of them are buying for the first time, so where did they come from?<p>#10 Speculation - I&#x27;d love to see real numbers on this today, in 2006 I could see the problem but I think the mortgage meltdown took a lot of those people out.<p>#11 Moving and &#x27;retiring&#x27; is fun, and the older I get the more folks I know have taken this route. Those folks are leaving behind houses which are being bought up.<p>#12 Trouble at Fannie and Freddie. Boy was that spot on. I am still wondering what will be the final resolution of that mess.<p>#13 Love the business week quote, it was made without an understanding of the underlying mortgage mechanism that was about to embroil the world in the greatest financial meltdown since the Depression.<p>So it is helpful to compare this authors fears and their outlook with what actually happened in the 8 years since they wrote this. Yes there was something amiss in the housing market (the unholy love child between derivatives and sub-prime mortgages) and that did come to roost and did blow up. But <i>once</i> it blew up, the system has adapted. If you believe that the economy was &quot;too good to be true&quot; because it was being manipulated in this way, is it now more true? Less true? We will continue to see reverberations of that event in finance going forward, we appear to have avoided for now a similar melt down in commercial real estate, and many trillions of dollars have been &quot;lost&quot; back to the future where they belong. Good things have happened too, and eventually your grand children will read about this in their history books like we&#x27;ve read about the Great Depression. The tragedy would be if we failed to learn anything useful from the experience.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Bay-Area-is-fastest-growing-region-in-state-5442241.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Bay-Area-is-fastest-growi...</a>",1404151648

Future passage of patent reform cannot cause that to happen because it has already happened and causality requires the cause to precede the effect. Patent reform could allow small inventors to better enforce their patents because they wouldn&#x27;t have to worry as much about counterclaims using low quality patents that would currently cause them to be bankrupted with litigation costs.<p>> I have seen so many reforms in other areas, that just made things worse -- I would even say most of the &quot;reforms&quot; I have seen.<p>That isn&#x27;t an argument.

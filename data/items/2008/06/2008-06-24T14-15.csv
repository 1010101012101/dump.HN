I scrollwheel down and it jumps up and down like a kid with hyperactivity disorder. There's no scrollbar - I have no idea where I am in the list of stories. Trying to match up where I was with where I am now is pretty hard. You've put up/down/top/bottom buttons at the very top and called them ""Navigate"".<p>So you've reimplemented a scrollbar (Standard browser UI component), but very very badly.<p>Up and down keys don't scroll properly either. If I hold down a key, it should keep repeating. Pressing a key should scroll the amount I am used to. You seem to be scrolling by a <i>lot</i>, on keyup - not what people expect.<p>Sorry, but I just hate it when people reinvent something that already exists, is standard, and works. Especially when their implementation is completely unusable.<p>Why not just use a scrollbar like people expect?<p>Also when I click on an article to read it, I expect to click [back], to go back, instead of clicking on [return to the reader]. Once again, ignoring standard browser usability.<p>Also if you try to open an article link in a new window, or copy it to send to a friend etc, it breaks, and you land at the homepage (I assume you're using onclick etc).

Also, the bookmarks link is a bit confusing; it shows a few icons (like del.icio.us) and one could think that clicking on a part of that bookmarks icon would be linking to that particular service.

2264699,comment,2264258,2264258,0,0,6ren,,,"I used to think this was a stupid idea, because of latency; and the only reason it got funding was because it would be <i>fantastic</i> for publishers (if it worked): no pirating, can charge by the hour, most people don't play their console 24/7, so it's a better utilization of resources (you can even time-zone it, albeit with worse latency), etc.<p>But just today I recognized it as a profound disruption: a service that isn't very good, with a cheaper business model, that targets non-consumption.<p>When the network does become good enough - and it's only getting faster - these guys will have encountered and solved all the myriad other technical problems (like iron man and altitude freeze). And they will also have solved all the problems with the business model (suppliers, charging, customer issues). It will be hard to catch them.<p>And... turns out people are saying the latency isn't actually as off-putting as you'd think, for FPS etc. I've heard a bigger problem is with mouse-pointers - the latency between the mouse moving and the pointer moving is apparently much more perceptible.<p>So, I say congratulations to these guys. Make a crap product for cheap; let everyone laugh at you; make it better. They are the visionary entrepreneurs, who actually change everything. No derision means no revolution.",1298689189
2264698,comment,2264517,2264517,0,0,davepeck,,,"I've been a heavy App Engine user since the beta days -- even gave a talk at I|O 2009 about scaling with App Engine. I have clients that run complex GAE sites that handle millions of daily requests.<p>I somewhat disagree with the author about scalability. There is a very narrow sweet spot of apps for which App Engine is a quite natural solution. If you're in the sweet spot, you'll probably scale well without too much up-front engineering investment.<p>The sweet spot _is_ narrow, though. For example, as the OP states: geo data doesn't really belong on GAE -- you can do a limited set of bounding box/proximity queries with the third party geomodel library, but wow, it's expensive and dog slow!<p>I do agree with the author about both the status dashboard (it only sometimes reflects my current experience with the system) and the surprising variation it data store latency. Latency has been much improved of late with 1.4 and beyond.",1298689174

2264682,story,,,2,5,malandrew,"Ask HN: Interest in a service that lets you charge others to send you email?",,"So, it's pretty clear that email is a huge time vampire for anyone remotely important. It's simply too easy for others to send you email these days. The only barrier is two clicks: (1) click new email button, (2) click send.<p>Who on HN would be interested in a paid email service? Not one where you pay for email, but where you set up contact groups and a price that that group must pay to send you an email.<p>So for example, I may have a group called family, where I charge my family members 25 cents each to send me an email. I may have another group that are close friends that I may also charge 25 cents. I may have another group called acquaintances that I charge $1 dollar. For people that I don't have in my address book I charge $5 dollars.<p>Other potential features:<p>-- charge people by the 100 characters of text they send you.<p>-- give each person in certain groups a weekly or monthly quota. i.e. family members are allowed 3 free emails per month.<p>The basic idea is that time equals money and therefore reading email costs you money. This would allow you to recoup that money and also reduce the amount of time you waste in email by intentionally reducing conversion by charging people and adding more than two clicks to the task of sending email.<p>Would this be interesting to HNers?",1298688607

Palm Pre 2 was launched in France only. Wait - what??<p>Afer seeing their latest announcements I hit the power button on my Android device. I ordered a simple Pre Plus and looked into the SDK. So, while 'eekfuh' mit be not interested to develop for the platform: For me it'sthe best thing ever. Maemo/MeeGo is arguably dead. Android is a sad example of a NIH syndrome for everyhing ('based on Linux' for Android devices is really not serious in my world). Webos is not only reusing the well-known Linux stack components, it's reusing a really great programming paradigm as well.<p>Bottom line: The latest HP announcement (although I hate: See this, it's available in half a year!) made me purchase a Palm Pre Plus (which is better imo than any Android device I've used for a long time), to get started developing apps for a platform I really believe in.",1298685976

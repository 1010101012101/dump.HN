This post is a hollow re-tread of the <i>""lower my taxes and I'll trickle it down""</i> argument, which has been the primary platform of the Republican party (and wealthy people) since I've been alive.  Our tax rates are dramatically lower than they were even 20 years ago, and I have to say...it doesn't seem to be working that well.<p>Two observations that came immediately to mind while reading this post:<p>1) Accountants and lawyers are people with jobs.  Fire them and replace them with non-accountant, non-lawyer jobs, and all you've done is shuffle the jobs around.<p>Yes, you can argue that every dollar spent on non-administrative expenses can be invested into productivity, but that leads me to my second observation:<p>2) Small businesses just don't spend that much on administrative overhead.<p>I've worked at far more small businesses (<20 employees) than large ones, and all of them -- every single one -- has out-sourced the accounting expenses to such a degree that I doubt there's a single full-time equivalent lost in the shuffle.  Legal expenses can be more variable, but typically not because of government overhead.<p>When I hear this argument coming from extremely rich people, my natural instinct is to assume that they're using the populist vision of the ""struggling small business owner"" to promote policies that would benefit their personal bottom line.  Quite honestly, this looks like more of the same.  Mark Cuban has a lot more to gain from cuts in the corporate tax rate than does your average small business owner -- yet he'll never employ enough people to make up the difference.",1264967364

1090958,comment,1090632,1090632,0,0,BobbyH,,,"There is a huge reason why tech firms don’t pay dividends: their employees have stock options. Unfortunately, although dividends paid to shareholders lower the share price, the strike price on employee options is not adjusted for the lower share price caused by dividend payments. Thus, paying dividends hurts the value of employee stock options, so tech firms that use options NEVER pay dividends.<p>Also, in terms of returning retained earnings to investors, there is no difference between a company paying dividends and a company repurchasing shares (assuming the shares are fairly valued). Happily, though, when a company repurchases shares, it doesn’t affect the strike price of stock options. Thus, tech firms don’t pay dividends and they repurchase shares instead. So in addition to the ""dividend yield"", we also need to add in all the capital that Microsoft spent on share repurchases, which was $47.7B in the fiscal year ending in June 2009 (<a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/msft/reports/ar09/10k_fr_fin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/msft/reports/ar09/10k_fr_fin.html</a>). That ain’t nothing.<p>As an aside, Microsoft started paying dividends only after switching from using employee stock options to using restricted stock (the value of which isn’t affected by dividend payments).<p>These points aside, the author has a good point, which is that more tech firms should do more to return retained earnings to shareholders (whether via share repurchases or dividends).",1264967052

I can't quite find the link to the article now though. I'm sure there are others doing this too, but sometimes adoption rates are slow when there's not enough hype. But the issue is probably more to do with software.<p>I've been researching into this to try it myself for a database-centric web app, but I realized I'd have to write much of the software to incorporate flash. For example, you have to make sure that in-memory caches are delegated to flash and kept there according to an LRU algorithm. I'd also expect items stored in flash to be promoted to in-memory storage when accessed often enough, and demoted to disk when used less. And I'm sure there are other intricacies I haven't thought about that need to be considered to make a three-tier storage system work well.<p>Rather than writing application-specific code for all this, there really should be some general solution that handles this automatically.",1264966694

They're gambling that lower prices for eBooks will lead to higher sales, and that the increased volume will make up the difference for everybody.<p>Macmillan is trying to drive the prices up so they can still recoup their fixed costs <i>given current sales numbers for eBooks</i>. They're not gambling at all -- they're trying to structure prices so if the eBook market stagnates they still break even, which has the very pleasing side effect that if eBook sales increase even slightly (something the iPad is threatening to help happen), all the revenue from those additional sales will be pure profit.<p>I can see points on both sides here.

What I'm getting at is that if they <i>do</i>, or if they use HTML5, they're still presenting a better quality product to users of this platform than they would using Flash. To Apple, that is a far more important thing than what they're potentially losing from not supporting Flash. Nobody ""has to"" develop iPhone apps any more than people ""have to"" develop Flash apps for the web. It's all about what experience you want to deliver to what audience.<p>Right now, there are compelling reasons to go either way or even both ways. I'm just saying there will never be a time when going in the direction of Flash-based web apps will get you access to the iPhone/iPad audience, an audience which is growing, unlike the Flash audience. So yeah, I think Apple made the right decision both for their own product and for developers who care about the quality of experience they can provide and the money they can make than they do the particular platform they use.<p>Obviously this makes Flash developers unhappy, and Adobe is doing the best they can to cater to those developers with CS5, even if it hastens their own demise.<p><i>They're locked into the iPhone and you have to pay $99 to deploy them on a real one.</i><p>Flash apps are locked into the Flash runtime, further locked into whatever platform assumptions you make about performance, etc., and the developer tools are considerably more expensive than $99. You don't get the distribution or sales channel of the App Store (which in spite of all it's faults is still a very valuable thing). If you're developing games, you're going to be giving a cut to whatever sites you're hosted on, etc.<p>I'm not saying that's worse. It's just a different trade-off, and as long as you're depending on any platform vendor, you're always going to be getting a little bit screwed. The question is really about how dependent, how screwed, and how strong is the platform.<p>The same applies to an open platform like HTML5. It may have the market penetration to kill Flash for every use, but the overall outlook is pretty good.<p><i>But Flash is the only thing that can deliver that right now on desktop (and cover a reasonable audience). </i><p>Yeah, but we're not really talking about the desktop when we talk about Flash. We're talking about the web, and the web is increasingly used from machines that aren't desktops or laptops. Flash may be installed on 98% or so of desktops and laptops, but if you include ""all devices capable of using the web"", Adobe's share is much lower and is actually <i>shrinking</i>, and not just because of Apple's products.

Here are three things that happened to me at their main bank office over the last 6 months.<p>1 - I sat down with a mid-level manager asking about a debit card in my wife's name for one of my accounts.  The manager pulled up my account and says ""I see you were in Wilmington last week.  My family is from there.""  And we chatted about Wilmington for a bit.<p>2 - I walked up to the teller desk and said ""Please move $500 from account A to account B.""  I filled out no forms, showed no id, didn't even know the account numbers.  The teller said ""No problem Mr. Hancock, have a nice day.""<p>3 - I needed to change my phone number linked to all my accounts.  I walked into the teller and told her I have 5 accounts and wanted to change the phone number on all of them but didn't have my account numbers at hand.  She handed me a post-it note and asked me to write down the new phone number:  ""No problem Mr. Hancock, we'll see it gets done.""<p>The approach this bank takes is oriented around trust and liability, not IT security.  Some may be upset that a bank manager would/could scan my transactions and openly acknowledge they see where I was last week. But I see this as openness in acknowledging that they can see the data.  All banks can see this data and many credit data warehouses have this data.  My bank simply doesn't pretend they can't see it.<p>In response to your post, jacquesm, I completely agree with your point of view from an IT perspective.  However, I do not expect a bank, large or small, to get things perfect internally.  So I choose to do business with one I trust to uphold their end of liability.  I take this approach with most business partners, as I'm sure many do.  When I buy a $50 item on ebay, I expect less of the supplier and pay accordingly.",1264965108

The boss is SUPPOSED to use the staff to accomplish more than s/he can do on their own, protecting those doing the work from the ""corporate BS"".  It's a sign of maturity (bad word) or self-confidence (better word?) when the boss lets go the competitiveness and starts doing their job.",1219748308

That's why we decided to incorporate in UK since a Ltd. is a valid legal form EU-wide and leaves all of the incorporation documents in English, which is easier for investors to deal with.",1219748185

It's going to take a while to reach that number but it's not the entire population either.  On the other hand the whole population isn't going to pay to use 23andMe either.<p>The author seems to think this initiative is the death of 23andMe et al.  To use the Coriell service you have to actually walk in the door.  If you're not in the neighbourhood then it may be easier and cheaper to use 23andMe.",1219748024

286944,comment,286512,286647,0,0,apexauk,,,"agree about failing loudly when bad stuff happens - but exceptions are best reserved for truly exceptional circumstances. in webdev everything arrives from the browser as a string so implicit casting is more of the norm. if your user enters something dumb into the quantity field of your shopping cart it doesn't really warrant abandoning the rest of their input and leaping back up the call stack to a ""misson failed""-level error handler.<p>functions like is_numeric('string') exist for the rarer situations where things like this actually matter, but php's default way is simply reflective of it's nature as a loosely-typed language.",1219747093

So the problem is not only in getting visas for some of the founders but also incorporating in the US as I figure PG has no interest in 6% of a germany based company.

There were four teams from outside of the US in our YC class, two from Canada, one from the UK and one team from Austria. I can think of at least four other teams from abroad from previous classes.<p>In fact there is a kind of UK YC inside YC. The UK guys really stick together and help each other out. If you can get a hold of any of them I'm sure they'll point you in the right direction.<p>Papers and immigration are always a difficult issue. In most cases you can get a work visa or whatever visa lets you attend conferences in the US and it will be enough for the 3 month YC session.",1219745556

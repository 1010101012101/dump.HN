7090817,comment,7090344,7090700,1,0,conradlee,,,"I&#x27;m one of the Synference co-founders, and we&#x27;ve thought a lot about how to make it easy to extract relevant information from users who land on your site for the first time.<p>There are many important pieces of information you can grab from a user who&#x27;s never been on your site based on basic information available to all web servers, such as the user&#x27;s IP address and user agent: (1) the time of day/day of week they&#x27;re visiting -- relevant because, e.g., night users or weekend users might be a different demographic (2) information related to the particular page they&#x27;re visiting, such as article category on wikipedia (3) operating system type and age (4) device type -- smartphone, tablet, pc (5) geographic location.<p>You can use location to infer a range of demographic features, such as income, education, etc.  Due to its importance, location is an attribute that Synference adaptively coarsens/zooms in on.  For example, if you have a lot of users from a certain city, then each user within that city will have a location whose granularity goes down to the neighborhood.  But if you have relatively few users from Europe, then each user&#x27;s location might only be at the level of the country.<p>The Synference API makes it easy to extract this information.  All you have to do is send the API the user&#x27;s IP address and user agent, and the API parses those two pieces of information into most of the features I&#x27;ve just listed.  We also add a timestamp (corrected for the user&#x27;s timezone using the IP address&#x27;s geographic location).<p>We don&#x27;t need to split users into buckets---machine learning classifiers build models that automatically take care of deciding how a user&#x27;s attributes can be used to predict the target metric.",1390240703

It&#x27;s founded on open-source, 100%, unlike certain other supposedly-open browsers created by ad-companies.<p>2. It&#x27;s extremely extensible and is the only browser I can feel I can make &quot;mine&quot;.<p>3. It has a clear stance on the value of the open web. <i>No DRM shall pass.</i> All other big browser vendors are peddling one DRM or another, and they are doing so on the open web, with no shame, no regret. Using those browsers implicitly makes you support Web-DRM, and to me that is completely unacceptable.<p>4. Where it tries to evolve standards it does so in a compatible way, and is open to community feedback. Compare this to for instance Google which develops a product in house, client and server code, in a quick turn releases it, as is, on the open web with some light docs saying &quot;It&#x27;s an open standard, anyone can use it. Just don&#x27;t ask for us to do things differently&quot;. See Google&#x27;s own attempt at ActiveX-like technology (NaCl, this website is incompatible with your CPU architecture) and how they&#x27;ve completely hijacked HTTP 2.0 with a new protocol which honours nothing of what made HTTP a success.<p>There are <i>no</i> browsers currently out there which gives me any incentive to switch from Firefox. And doing so for a few milliseconds improved loading-times seems like complete madness.<p>From a freedom point of view all other browsers are compromised. Only Firefox remains.<p>What happened to the world of techies with principles? Did you throw them all out when you bought those laptops from that Cupertino based patent-troll and launched a Web 2.0 URL-shortener written in node.js compiled with emscripten?",1390240656

You can make the argument that it could be better, and I agree with that sentiment within the article.  But one of the first things to bear in mind when optimising is to always go for the low-hanging fruit first.<p>Although it&#x27;s just my guesstimate, I&#x27;m imagine that the broad approach to A/B testing (or just doing it at all in the first place!), will be the most important and easiest fruit to grab.  Whilst a multi-armed bandit solution will probably only provide much smaller returns on top.  So given a choice between a wikipedia dev concentrating on improving the overall message, as opposed to trying to improve 5 or more cohorts at once - I&#x27;d go for the easier option until it stops giving significant returns.<p>That&#x27;s not to say it shouldn&#x27;t be done eventually.

No one ones to move to SF and live in a neighborhood with a suburban lifestyle that requires a car to maximize life&#x27;s experiences.<p>Living in places like the Richmond and the Sunset for example are more isolating than living in Oakland. Living at the top of most of San Francisco&#x27;s hills is relatively isolating as well. Furthermore, hills aren&#x27;t conducive to human-powered transportation like biking and skateboarding. Being able to quickly move around via the power of your own two feet via walking, pedaling or pushing is one of the draws of all cities.

If you see stock performance (at least public stocks), both in terms of cap growth and dividend yield, you see a pretty grim picture in the last 10 years compared to older times. Privately held companies are somewhat in the shadow here, but there is no big reason to think they are doing much better than public ones. Stock appreciation and dividends are what forms income of capitalists.<p>So it is change of the salary distribution to the top 1% (to the extent that it dilutes that said 1% of many smaller capitalists that used to be there with some ex-proletarians) from lower income groups, not shift of focus from capital to labor.<p>Personally all rich people i knew 10 years ago were business owners or co-owners, with addition of a few corruptioners.

Entities can query a global database of entities (tagged, component based) and retrieve their state by dereferencing.

It says that whiteness gives you privilege over colored people. It says that being male gives you privilege over people who are female. And being rich gives you privilege over people who are poor. An interaction between a middle-class black man and a rich white woman can be a fascinating minefield, where either of them can be the „oppressed” side depending on the context. In fact it’s getting more popular to use the word „kyriarchy” to avoid the overly-specific „patriarchy”.<p>Of course yes, many feminists actively hate intersectionality, and others don’t completely grasp the context.

Is it racist to say that black students on average score lower on the SATs? No, it is a statistical fact. Is it racist to proclaim these students as stupid because of that? Yes, extremely, because you are judging their intelligence base on race without understanding why that statistic might be true.<p>Instead of being so heavily concerned with what you &quot;can&quot; and &quot;can not&quot; say without being racist, its important to focus on why these statistics do exist and understand why they are true.<p>Your statement implies that the student is stupid because they are black. That is racist and strictly false. So why do these students score lower? Probably due the incredibly high level of institutionalized racism that they experience every day of their life.<p>We need to work towards building a better society together, and eliminating societal constraints based on characteristics beyond their control characteristics. By focusing on how you can&#x27;t say racists things (and if you didn&#x27;t know it would be racist, then not bothering to understand why), and how that is unfair to you takes focus away from the real issues. Black students are scoring lower on the SATs, and its because as a society, we have institutionalized racism towards them.

I&#x27;ve been deliberating over how to write a game loop for my pet project [1] that allows multiple threads to concurrently update the world state without causing inconsistencies.<p>For example, let&#x27;s take the age-old problem of two people in the game (potentially both AI-controlled) both deciding to pick up an item.  If two separate threads are handling the logic, both having a view of the world with the item on the ground, and both of them end up trying to update the world state such that the item ends up in somebody&#x27;s inventory, what is a clean and elegant way to resolve that?<p>I&#x27;ve considered using STM, having a ref to each entity in the game, and wrapping each bit of game logic in a transaction, thus rolling back entity updates that conflict with previously committed entity updates.  I&#x27;m concerned about the performance implications of this, though.

It should really go without saying that there is a racial element to this -- police officers don&#x27;t know how much money you make or how much class privilege you can truly bring to bear when they decide to stop you, pull you over, search you, or arrest you. Being black or brown in a predominately affluent (and chances are, predominately white) neighborhood doesn&#x27;t make you exempt from being bothered - in fact, it makes you look more &quot;out of place&quot; and more likely to be stopped, and I say that both from a casual review of literature but also my personal experiences. And of course, just about every day we hear about all sorts of wealthy black people (Forrest Whittaker comes to mind as a relatively recent high-profile example) who get treated like criminals at stores because overzealous security guards have unconscious (or sometimes even conscious!) biases.<p>The fact that black & brown people are disproportionately stopped, searched, arrested, convicted, and sentenced means that white people are disproportionately not stopped, not searched, not arrested, acquitted, or given lenient sentences.  It means that a lot of white kids have been given second chances / have had their illegal habits or decisions overlooked and gone on to still get financial aid (drug convictions can permanently disqualify you for federal financial aid), not be a felon, and get decent jobs in decent neighborhoods when the exact same doors are closed for many people of color who didn&#x27;t do anything differently.<p>Yes, there is a class component to all of this - being wealthy may make it easier to get off after your arrest - but the biases in the criminal justice pipeline at and before arrest are really more race-based than anything.<p>I don&#x27;t think that anyone thinks that being white affords white people the kinds of privileges that a $500k/year salary gives you.  That&#x27;s really a pretty absurd suggestion and I think most reasonable people who are not completely ignorant should be aware of all of the white poverty that exists to know that. But, even after controlling for everything else - including crimes committed - it does help to keep you out of prison and the criminal justice system.<p>That&#x27;s not the only privilege, either.

Rust tasks are optimized for maximum performance once you spin them up, at the cost of some overhead once you spawn them. That was a deliberate choice, because not having segmented stacks makes many much more important things far faster, such as calling into C and performing tight sequential computations without thrashing on stack boundaries or using a garbage collector to move stacks around and rewrite all the pointers. Rust is about making costs explicit: when every function call could turn into a huge malloc(), you lose a lot of predictability over performance (and Go found this out too from what I gather).<p>Calling into C is a big one: we concluded it was basically impossible to make Rust calling into C as cheap as C calling into C in a segmented stack implementation.

I have lots and lots of experience with them, I am related to a couple, and I have been very intensely monitoring them for quite some time. I am confident in my assessments and assertions, but they remain only that. What&#x27;s more, I consider the majority of pigs undertrained, weak minded sheep. I also use the term &quot;pig&quot;, instead of the harsher terms they tend to deserve. All of this adds up to a massive bias on my part, so do not forget that when you are typing your pro-pig hell rant.<p>Most US police forces lack the discipline and capability to field a Special Weapons And Tactics team. Instead, they have Volunteers. These are regular beat cops who sat through a few training courses and maybe ran a few smash and grab walk troughs at some point. They keep a flack vest, helmet and carbine AR in their trunk. Most SWAT calls are just beat pigs dealing with something over there head, which can be anything from a person who knows their rights to an actuall increased threat scenario. Real SWAT teams are the picture of tactical efficiency and reserve. Most footage [i completely discount all cinematic SWAT silliness] you will see has yelling and gun pointing and one cute video of a fat, crazy drunk getting zipped up by a SWAT bro with an MP5 [never take a breech loader to an automatic fight]. This discounts all of the rigorous training, both physical and mental, that these operators go through in the short window they are allowed to be in an actual SWAT team. I cannot vouchsafe the conduct of all SWAT, but my anecdotal experience was awesome.<p>I will leave off most the detail, but here is my short story. This was the first time I interacted with SWAT. It will not be the last, I fear. I was in a place I probably should have avoided, when I decided to step out for a jack. I was laughing at a lame joke my friends girlfriend had made [i was/am that guy] as I opened the front door. When I swung my head forward, I was greeted by 6 or 7 homeboys in black tac gear. They were setting to take the door. The point man [guy in front] leveled his hellasweet HK USP .45 at my face and politely asked me to, &quot;please hold the door&quot;. I remember being able to see down the barrel of his shooter. He had one in the chamber. I graciously swung the door wide and bowed fairly low, like some drug addled varlet. Point guys swept by as number 2 gently spun me and zip tied my wrists. He kind of whispered &quot;don&#x27;t be stupid&quot;. I do not know what he meant, but I had been a military sycophant for a long time so I knew the drill and sank to my knees. They were done in seconds. 2 of them helped me up gently and ushered me to the couch. They left quietly and broke nothing. I cannot say the same for the overweight, callous detectives that spent 4+ hours figuring out that they had taken a house with no evidence and only one of their targeted suspects [he was released because he had no ID on him]?<p>I have had many experiences with many levels of LEO and none has ever instilled the respect and admiration I have for a true SWAT team.<p>No constables.

Sweden has lots of companies that export stuff to the US and other places. Now they get paid in dollar which they convert to Swedish kronor.<p>So a Swedish company sells cars to the US and gets $100 million/year. Convert it to kronor and you get about 1 billion. Government decides to help them so they decide that Swedish currency is only worth 50% of what it used to (yes they can/could decide that). Suddenly, they the company now makes 2 billion per year.<p>Meanwhile, Swedish people buy TV:s and game consoles from the US. All that now cost <i>double</i> of what it did since their currency is worth half of what it was.<p>So what should the Swedes do? Demand salary increases to offset the higher prices of course. Since the (exporting) companies makes double the profits, they should be able to double the salaries.

7090531,comment,7085028,7090122,3,0,gd1,,,"Bodek is a failed trader, and one who apparently can&#x27;t read exchange API manuals (here&#x27;s BATS explaining it for him: <a href=""https://www.batstrading.com/resources/features/bats_exchange_pricesliding.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.batstrading.com/resources/features/bats_exchange...</a>). Now he&#x27;s trying to make money from sensationalism and poorly written books.<p>That aside, Hide not Slide orders are an interesting case.  They exist only in US equity markets, and they&#x27;re a great study in unintended consequences.  US equities are quite fragmented (the same security can be traded on several different exchanges), so well intentioned US regulators introduced something called the NBBO (National Best Bid Offer), ostensibly to &quot;protect investors&quot; from getting a worse price on one exchange.  What this meant is that different exchanges trading in the same product could never be &quot;locked&quot; - you could never have one exchange showing say 101 on the bid when another has 101 on the ask (because in theory then they are crossed and should trade).  Pretend the tick size is 1 for following discussion...<p>This leads to a situation where every equity exchange in the US may be trading 100/102 (with an empty tick in the middle), but as long as one remaining exchange is trading 100/101, you aren&#x27;t allowed to insert a bid at 101 on the other exchanges (since the interpretation of the rule is that this would be unfair on the resting 101 offer).  But HFTs are all very keen to be the first to fill that 100/102 gap in the spread - to be the first on that new queue is an advantage since you get filled first.  And obviously that one holdout exchange will soon get filled and the price will tick up.  But the other exchanges legally can&#x27;t accept a bid at 101 yet.<p>So exchanges started to either reject orders or &quot;slide&quot; them - you submit that 101 Buy and they slide it down to a 100 Buy.  Which leads to this:<p>10 SUBMIT BUY@101<p>20 IF RESPONSE = &quot;SLIDE TO 100&quot; THEN DELETE, GOTO 10<p>All of a sudden the exchanges are being flooded with messages, as algos are pinging the exchange constantly wanting to put that 101 bid in.  Which leads us to &#x27;Hide not slide&#x27; - the exchanges promise to sit on your order until the NBBO ticks up and put it in the queue then.  The problem is that these order types, while documented and available to all who are connected to the exchange directly, aren&#x27;t usually going to be available to someone who is trading through an intermediary - a broker or some retail trading platform.  So that&#x27;s the story of how a well intentioned bit of regulation ended up disadvantaging US investors.<p>US equity markets are full of weird quirks like this, the NBBO needs to be done away with.",1390237938

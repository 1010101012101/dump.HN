Almost exactly one quarter of my middle school class came from my elementary school.  Everyone I went to Kindergarten with, graduated as a senior with me 13 years later, minus obvious attrition due to moving, etc.   From observation of other posts this is apparently highly unusual.  Perhaps you all draw lots and are randomly assigned to any school in the district?  This is kinda interesting.<p>I live in the same city in 2014 as we lived in the 80s when I was going to school, and the district still does things the same way... assuming I don&#x27;t move, my kids will graduate high school with the kids from their Kindergarten class.  So if its a fad, its long lived.<p>I would propose the transition can&#x27;t be any more &quot;awful&quot; than moving to a new school.  My parents never moved during my entire K-12 experience, which is apparently also an outlier.  I am told that other kids have survived moving to a new school one or twice; going thru the experience with 250 of their closest friends can&#x27;t be nearly as bad.",1416167801

8615202,comment,8614159,8614847,0,0,darkmighty,,,"This is actually the reason I believe CRTs look better for a given resolution. The square reconstruction filter has a quite poor frequency response. If you look at a far enough distance (or good enough resolution), the cognitive low pass filter when you see the image is going to mitigate the problem, but up close it&#x27;s quite bad. The smooth fall-off of CRT&#x27;s pixel &quot;point spread function&quot; actually resembles a bit more the ideal sinc filter for reconstruction of bandlimtied signals. The square window has nasty zeros and decays very slowly in frequency.<p>I think manufacturers don&#x27;t have a solution to this because the light producing elements inherently produce light across a small surface. They can&#x27;t make this surface much smaller (and then apply a good blurring filter) since that would incur directly less brightness. Also, if they could, it would probably be more costly then simply making a larger number of smaller pixels (which also raises resolution).<p>I&#x27;m sure a lot of manufactures are not even mindful of these issues though, and I ssupect a compromise would be possible with some R&D.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s interesting this phenomenon is about the same across time. Some high-end monitor manufacturers are starting to offer strobed high frequency displays that don&#x27;t exhibit the poor response of a window reconstruction. With a high enough refresh rate the temporal time constant of our visual system is enough to provide a good reconstruction.

They generally separated and tracked and labeled the classes by &quot;intensive&quot; &quot;college prep&quot; &quot;unlabeled&quot; and &quot;basic&quot; from top to bottom.  I was in &quot;intensive&quot; math so in my last year I took college calculus.  I was merely in &quot;college prep&quot; english lit with the primary effect that I got better letter grades than my friends in &quot;intensive&quot; english lit, also my reading assignments were shorter as were my essay requirements.  It was explained you&#x27;d never be able to do college level work unless you took the &quot;college prep&quot; level classes.  It was explained to us that for the rest of our lives our industrial corporate employers would care very deeply about who took Int English Lit 11 vs College Prep English Lit 11, not to mention how much they&#x27;d care about our middle school grades (LOL).  There is something of a fad in the usa to mainstream absolutely all students into the &quot;college prep&quot; classes, to maximize revenue.

These sensors collect light from some area over time which can be recovered as information (chemically or electrically).  Light passing through an aperture is subject to diffraction (which rules out a perfect square beam of light) and possibly other distortions, and the sensor may or may not be a perfect, uniform square, but in any case it&#x27;s all equivalent to a perfect point in space that receives undistorted, refractionless light then applies a filter and integrates it over time and area.<p>The underlying physical phenomenon that allows integration to happen is the ability for a film grain or ccd cell to count up incoming photons.<p>These ideal sensors may be arranged on a <i>grid</i>, but the filter that maps source light to sensor value won&#x27;t look anything like non-overlapping square boxes.",1416166464

I.E. Perhaps Comcast can charge 1$ /mbit/second charged @95th percentile, if they are determined to be a common carrier / title II applicable.   Then providers like Netflix (or anyone, for that matter) that fulfilled the minimum operational requires (NOC, peering points, etc...) could purchase transit directly from Comcast.  Alternatively, if they don&#x27;t fulfill those technical requirements, or just don&#x27;t want to bother, they can purchase transit from providers like Cogent/Level 3, who would resell at a bit of a markup.<p>That&#x27;s the future I envision being the happy medium for consumers, last mile providers, transit providers, and content providers.",1416166192

So close the metal shop and shove all the kids into college prep, close the ceramic arts room and shove the kids into a 4th year of english lit, close the CAD drafting lab and shove the kids into a required 3rd year of math, that sort of thing.<p>(edited to add, and its been a miserable failure at increasing math and reading scores, but its done a truly excellent job of making sure none of the kids know how to change the oil in their car or which end of the soldering iron gets hot)<p>IF and only if you get rid of all the specialized classes, such that all kids attend the same college prep classes, THEN it&#x27;ll be realistic to go all K-12 in the one room school house again.",1416165343

You use the proceeds to increase wages.<p>Some point in the future, supply increases back to normalized levels, but now the cost of supply has also increased (because you pay people more), so the wholesale prices remain increased. Prices can only drop back to levels of the new cost floor, or the cost floor has to be moved down somehow -- in this case reducing wages.<p>We see a similar effect in oil markets because the cost of oil production has gone up as easy-to-exploit sources have dried up and more expensive sources have had to come on-line to meet demand. Production has actually <i>increased</i> but prices have stayed relatively high. This includes massive new production outside of OPEC cartel control, so even cartel price fixing doesn&#x27;t account for it. Even more important, in a major market like the U.S., the distribution costs have dropped as a share of wholesale prices as domestic supply has come on-line.<p>Consumers have simply gotten used to the higher prices so there&#x27;s reduced pressure to lower them competitively in order to ensure sufficient demand to move target inventory volume.<p>There&#x27;s also other factors than pure supply/demand. Product differentiation can build in higher prices through perceived value (or other factors) in consumer&#x27;s minds. Suppose over the next 10 years, the U.S. chocolate industry creates a marketing term &quot;Savanna Chocolate&quot; and starts rebranding all products by percentage of &quot;Savanna Chocolate&quot; they contain. &quot;Now with 5% Savanna Chocolate!&quot;, supplemented with a marketing campaign to push all products as &quot;Savanna Chocolate&quot;. The term is meaningless. However, it allows them to charge a 10% premium on product which helps guarantee higher prices.<p>Because Savanna Chocolate is not a thing, there&#x27;s nothing to compete against, it&#x27;s also trademarked. A competitor can&#x27;t simply start selling their cheaper &quot;6% Savanna Chocolate&quot; competitor because they&#x27;ll be sued into oblivion, if they wish to use the term, they&#x27;ll probably just be charged a license fee large enough to ensure price compliance. All they can do is start an information campaign to try to persuade the public that Savanna Chocolate doesn&#x27;t exist. These don&#x27;t necessarily translate into higher demand for a competitor&#x27;s product, and may in fact deflate the entire industry.<p>tl;dr - pricing is hard, simple supple-demand models don&#x27;t describe it very well.",1416165161

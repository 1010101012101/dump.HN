So, I check out my facebook feed or respond to that text message. Before smart phones, I would pick up a paper book that I had just bought and skim a little &#x27;cause I just couldn&#x27;t wait to get home. If it weren&#x27;t that, I might be looking for wildlife out my passenger-side window or fiddling with the radio, etc.<p>I guess I&#x27;m a bad person, but I&#x27;m pretty confident that I&#x27;m not the only one.

Just drove 1300 miles over the summer vacation, sometimes on long monotonous roads, and I&#x27;d be lying if I was paying full attention all the time.<p>My experience is exactly as he describes. In city traffic, at traffic lights, or just before an exit, my full attention is required and constant (I actually dislike GPS because of this, it distracts, especially if notifications are late, I&#x27;m looking at you Google Nav - &#x27;keep left at the fork&#x27;).<p>However, after so many years of driving, I have also developed some sort of autopilot/&#x27;trance driving&#x27; mode. It is typically engaged on long legs, or when extremely tired on a very familiar route (e.g. going home). I betcha if you ask professional drivers like truckers, they&#x27;ll tell you the same.<p>Edit: While in this mode, my &#x27;look-ahead&#x27; window is maximized. I gaze much further ahead than I do in &#x27;stress&#x27; situations. My focus point is definitely way past the windshield, usually several cars ahead of me. I gauge my speed by engine sound, distance to the cars ahead of me, local traffic flow etc etc. As such, I am not convinced that this heads-up display approach is a safety improvement. Sure, your eyes will be on the road, but by requiring a change of focus, you cannot look ahead to anticipate issues/changes/risks.",1410662838

8314366,comment,8311808,8314251,3,0,pdkl95,,,"You don&#x27;t see a cost (an/or effort) difference between deploying an army of trivially simple packet sniffers and and deploying an army of of <i>stateful</i> (RAM requirement), <i>fast</i> (to deep-packet-inspect in realtime) MitM proxies? That notable difference in cost makes the endeavor worthwhile on it&#x27;s own, as long you remember what it buys you (still need real authentication).<p>A better comparison - which is often ignored in these discussions - is that the test for something being &quot;useful&quot; doesn&#x27;t rely only on if it solves <i>every</i> aspect of the problem. A method should also be compared to the <i>current</i> situation. For encryption, way too often the current situation is &quot;still using plaintext&quot;. In that situation, even <i>rot13</i> is an improvement because it require an attacker to take at least some minimal step.<p>Sometimes you can&#x27;t solve every part of the problem in one step. Adding an authentication feature later to improve something that already exists is probably easier than waiting for a perfect, complete product to happen.<p>Historically, the crypto community has taken a hard line approach that any weakness shouldn&#x27;t be allowed, because they correctly deduce that an attacker can use any weak link to break past all your security efforts. The result is we got pgp and everybody still using plaintext. The &quot;all or nothing&quot; attitude lead to web browsers complaining about self-signed certs when they should be <i>automatically</i> generated by Apache by default with HTTP retired permanently. Instead, browsers conflate authentication with encryption and scare people back to plaintext.<p>Even if hardware gets so cheap that is zero cost difference between passive eavesdropping and running a MitM proxy or deep-packet {inspection,injection}, non-authenticated crypto is <i>still</i> worthwhile: it creates a culture where encryption is normal instead of being seen as suspicious, and it can be an educational or traditional tool.<p>//of course, if we <i>can</i> get authentication as well, that would usually be a better option.

8314343,comment,8312070,8312914,3,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>Can you point to any SaaS best practices in this area?</i><p>That&#x27;s surprisingly difficult. IMNSHO, most SaaS fails completely on this count, and my businesses use very few of the trendy services for exactly this reason. Of those we do use, every single one is either (a) convenient but expendable without compromising the business, or (b) <i>both</i> well established <i>and</i> having some form of legally binding statements along the lines below.<p>What I would ideally like to see in most cases would be a guarantee that if a service were to be taken down then its source code would be released with some form of open licence so that any service you relied on could reasonably easily be converted to self-hosting. Obviously this isn&#x27;t worth much for services that are essentially proxies, such as most payment services, but it&#x27;s sufficient for continuity in many cases.<p>Otherwise, as a minimum I&#x27;d like to see automated tools for exporting data in some open format so it can be transferred to an alternative platform where this is a reasonable possibility. Where there are non-trivial issues relating to data export, such as with PCI DSS for the various card payment services, I think the most plausible approximation would be a legally binding promise to help transfer the data to an alternative provider.<p>Obviously if a start-up fails suddenly then even legally actionable promises aren&#x27;t going to be worth much if anything, which is why we won&#x27;t rely on any SaaS from a new start-up for anything essential no matter what their terms say. However, properly worded guarantees would at least stop exit strategies like acqui-hire or sell-to-competitor-who-shuts-you-down from screwing the customer base.<p>One good example IMHO is MailChimp, which provides a straightforward mechanism for customers to back up all their important data, not just mailing lists but also things like e-mail templates and stats that normally live on the remote system.<p>Another one that seems reasonable is Stripe, which has explicit wording in its (UK) legal terms guaranteeing meaningful notice under fair conditions if they&#x27;re going to terminate an account, and guaranteeing that they will facilitate transfer of card data to another payment service also under reasonable conditions if a merchant using their service decides to terminate.",1410661824

Short of a supernova or another event that heats the surface of the earth to hundreds of degrees Centigrade, everything from archaeic bacteria to tardigrades will survive any catastrophic event and eventually more complex life will evolve again. The earth&#x27;s biosphere will far outlive any civilization.<p>But we&#x27;re not talking about tardigrades and bacteria: we&#x27;re talking about millions upon millions of species that <i>do</i> have complex interdependencies with each other and the environment in general. We have no way to predict which species, when together decimated, might drastically impact our survival because they hunted pests that killed major oxygen producers or transmitted diseases through different animal and human populations. We have no way to know where in the equilibrium we are and which levers might set off a catastrophic downward spiral.<p>Hell, if there is a nuclear winter or asteroid impact, we are far enough along technologically that many humans, maybe even millions, would survive and rebuild civilization (say using nuclear power, chemical engineering, desalination, and hydroponic agriculture to survive underground until the environment clears up).

Oh, and the traffic was very write heavy, and coming not from the web, but from a large number of hardware devices running Java 1.4 over 2G using UDP. The packet routing for this was complex and involved at least two pieces of home-grown software (and even IP spoofing).

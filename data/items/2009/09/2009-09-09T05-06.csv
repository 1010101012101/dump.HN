Its a species of pufferfish, and considered something of a delicacy in Japan.  Fugu is a fishy fish, distinguished by other fishy fish by one property: its incredibly lethal nerve toxin.<p>Fugu sells <i>because of</i> the nerve toxin, not in spite of it.   You get to say ""Hey, I ate fugu, and <i>it didn't kill me!</i>"" (Ironically, fugu is probably the safest meal available in Japan, because everyone pulls out all the stops like ""clean your utensils before preparing the food"" when failing to do it means your hands get bathed in nerve toxin.)",1252475903

While that can be fruitful for certain kinds of problem, the danger is that you fall into a self-reinforcing thought pattern. Looking at it another way, it is rare to be able to psychoanalyse yourself - even therapists have therapists.<p>I think finding some kind of support network, be it family, friends, counseling or even the anonymous support that the Internet is so good at providing, may be better for you, if not your writing skills.",1252475835

812613,comment,812339,812339,0,0,chipsy,,,"My favorite of Flash's many non-sensical quirks:<p>If you create, in code, a Graphics object with a color of 0xFFFFFF(pure white), it won't draw. But 0xFEFFFF will work. There is probably some setting buried somewhere that impacts this, transparency/masking features being likely culprits, but it certainly isn't documented in the APIs.<p>At times, it seems like everything in the Flash APIs suffers from some kind of misfeature. You can load Sound data from a ByteArray, but not Video data. The security policy mechanisms have changed in major ways at least three times(maybe more, I've lost track) over the last three years, meaning everyone doing Flash networked apps has to keep an eagle-eye on player updates. Because Flash uses system fonts in lieu of including its own cross-platform default, you can't count on text rendering the same across platforms unless you always embed a font in your file(which, of course, adds file size). If you use alpha transparency, it will render quickly on Windows, slowly on OS X, and molasses-like on Linux, with the same hardware on all three. Accessing the stageWidth and stageHeight properties on the first frame(e.g. in a statically instanced variable) will give you an incorrect value. It just goes on and on like this.<p>But if you want to do something high-traffic and media-related on the web, you don't have many alternatives - Flash has the appropriate features and the largest deployment of any of the plugin-based options.",1252475442

I, for one, would rather make the computer understand what I'm thinking.<p>If I'm thinking ""hey, I want to evaluate this bit a bunch of times with different names"", why can't I just say that?  Isn't Ruby supposed to be the ""English With Some Bits Of Punctuation"" language?  Assuming I've met any security concerns, and I'm not doing anything incredibly complicated (which, honestly, wouldn't pass code review with or without eval), what's wrong with writing the code the way I want?<p>Looking at the author's received ""fix"", I don't understand it.  I'm not a big fancy Ruby expert, but I've been through the poignant guide, I've written some medium-sized stuff with it, I've used most of the syntax constructs, and I think I get the idioms.  The original makes sense; it's clear to me.  We do three string format operations, and eval each one, thus defining a module each time.  Great.<p>The ""fix"" confuses me:  ""what's Module.new (I thought you just did 'module Name; stuff; end')?"", ""what's define_method (it looks like def, but why doesn't it just say def)?"", ""what's Object.const_set, and why don't I see 'name' until then?"".  With some reasonable inference, these aren't tough questions, but there remains one: ""what the hell is the control flow diagram for this?"".  There are three anonymous functions defined in here, and I have no idea when the inner ones execute, or worse, are defined or compiled.  I thought I understood Ruby's control flow, and I could make a guess at this, but there's no way I'd bet money on the result.<p>So what if eval turns code into strings?  Code _is_ strings!  Do you think files are made of parse trees?  eval doesn't hide information, it adds another level of abstraction (and there's an old saying about solving problems in computer science somewhere in there).  Syntax highlighters, test coverage reports, static analyzers, and cyclomatic complexity calculators (really?) should all be able to handle it.  Why?  Because the feature is there, and it makes my life easier sometimes, and in those times, I want to use it.<p>So, umm, there!  That's what I think about eval.",1252474581

Some will do extraordinary things. Some will make mistakes. Some will be assholes. Many will do all three at some point in their lives.<p>* Medicine is a business. There are financial incentives pushing and pulling on the doctor&#x27;s behavior. Not saying it dictates everything they do, but denying its existence is folly. Just remember, there is a financial transaction involved every time you interact whether you see it or not.<p>* No one cares about your well being more than you and those that love you. Yes, doctors are well educated and, yes, they definitely want to heal you. But they aren&#x27;t going to stay up all night researching your symptoms, the treatment options, the drug interactions. Your loved ones may start from a far less informed place, but they will give every thing they have to heal you. To them you are a best friend, a sibling, a child, a spouse. To doctors you are one patient out of dozens or hundreds. This backseat google-doctoring infuriates medical professionals, but it is unavoidable. This isn&#x27;t a condemnation, it is just reality.",1413673181

8476623,comment,8475995,8475995,0,0,vacri,,,"<i>Spend a day in an emergency room, and chances are you’ll be struck by two things: the organizational chaos and the emotional detachment as nurses, doctors, and administrators bustle in and out, barely registering the human distress it is their job to address.</i><p>There is a difference between &#x27;spend a day&#x27; and &#x27;work long-term&#x27;. Medical staff are normal people; there&#x27;s no training that makes you immune to compassion fatigue. When you go into an ER and it&#x27;s all new to you and chaotic, it seems crazy that <i>these people are in pain</i> and <i>those people just don&#x27;t care</i>. But do it every working day of your life, and you have to buttress your emotion against it. Not to mention that it&#x27;s a fine line to walk, showing enough compassion. If you let emotion get the better of you, you&#x27;ll be less effective in your actual job of helping people. Throw in the occasional patient that is trying to pull the wool over your eyes, and you become to what looks to outsiders as a callous, uncaring individual. It&#x27;s not to say that all ER staff are saints, but whenever considering the ER environment, don&#x27;t forget to view it from the shoes of the people who work behind the counter long-term.<p>My own realisation of this buttressing: I used to work as a medical tech in what was essentially an outpatient clinic that did some patients on the ward. I remember one day, several years in, casually wandering up to the ward with my equipment, when I turned the corner and was met by a wailing wall of family coming the other way. &quot;Oh yeah - hospital is not a nice place to be. Normal people only come here when something is really bad...&quot;.",1413673052

Only the exponential growth in hardware performance has hidden that waste, but that is (fortunately?) coming to an end.<p>Despite humans writing it, code does not exist mainly to be read by humans. It exists to be executed by a machine, to solve a real problem for its users. Your users do not care about your source code. They want a small, fast and efficient application that does what they want. The majority of useful code is executed far more than it&#x27;s read or written.<p><i>program what need to be done in a way that a fellow stranger could understand</i><p>This is vague. I agree with you that writing purposely obtuse code for no other reason isn&#x27;t a good idea, but you should also be exploiting all the power your programming language has to offer when it can make your code simpler and more efficient. I believe that if someone else using the same programming language cannot understand your code, then they should improve themselves so they can.<p>See also: <a href=""http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/kernighans-lever/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/kernighans-lever/</a>",1413673029

8476620,comment,8474623,8474623,0,0,neltnerb,,,"Thanks for this story, I&#x27;ve been really confused about things like startup school myself. I guess I went to a seminar or two about how to think about a startup way back when I first realized I was definitely doing it wrong, but the idea of being around a thousand other wanna be entrepreneurs has always been intimidating and anxiety inducing to me.<p>I feel like it just makes me feel even less qualified to do what I&#x27;m doing, since I&#x27;m not a socialite. Sure, I can be friendly and engaged and talkative for short stretches, but the idea of being around a thousand excited people trying to network is just really depressing.<p>And I think after just reading/skimming the lean startup and steps to the epiphany, there&#x27;s really not much to learn from lectures... small groups and an expert discussing specifics sure, but such large groups have to trend towards generalities which I just find exhausting.<p>Really, I&#x27;m at my happiest when I&#x27;m in the lab building and testing things, and at my least happy when I&#x27;m feeling like I need to be constantly &quot;on&quot; selling my ideas. I assume lots of other technical founders feel similarly... I can deal with sales, and I can deal with negotiations, but even when I really do enjoy hearing other people&#x27;s stories it gets emotionally and intellectually taxing fast!",1413673015

8476608,comment,8475809,8476269,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"I just had to troubleshoot a small helper app that took some HTTP input and wrote to a DB. The code was in C# and had about 10 files spread over 3 namespaces, plus a separate test infrastructure project. All sorts of factory models were used to setup an &quot;HTTP pipeline&quot; and authentication modules. The problem I had to fix: after a server upgrade, authentication was broken.<p>After digging around for a while, I discovered there was no bug. The partner&#x27;s client code had the auth disabled, and the pervious server was misconfigured to not require auth. All which would not have been a problem if the system just did an &quot;if headers.auth != &quot;Basic ...&quot; - but buried in this forest of stuff, it was overlooked.<p>It seems that some developers just love their edifices. They build all this &quot;infrastructure&quot;, expanding code by an order of magnitude or more. It&#x27;s considered good and robust and so, so much writing online is dedicated to this pursuit. I think it gives those programmers a feeling of import, as if they&#x27;re really <i>architecting</i> something, not just pushing a few form fields around.<p>Even on the line by line basis, it&#x27;s shocking how they love verbosity. Type inference? Nope, that makes things too compact and hard to read. Higher order functions to wrap up common patterns? Too difficult to understand. I&#x27;m not sure if developers simply lack the tiny bit of extra intelligence, or if they&#x27;ve tried it and honestly concluded that overflowing verbosity is the key to readability. Either way, it&#x27;s sad, and holding back progress slightly.",1413672685

8476606,comment,8475995,8475995,0,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"It&#x27;s unfortunate that medical care has become almost adversarial. Our system is set up to treat acute conditions, but most people are being seen for chronic problems and our understanding of causes and training for treatments of chronic problems is woeful at best. Worse, both patients and doctors want a pill to make everything better.<p>After dealing with poor health for 30 years; I finally took my health into my own hands. After a series of self-experiments and a lot of journal reading, I now feel like I&#x27;m finally reaching health, but every time I see a doctor, it&#x27;s the same battle (&quot;OMG, your cholesterol is 239; you are a dead man walking!&quot; Yeah, I don&#x27;t think so).<p>There is a lot of good information out there, but there is also a lot of complete crap, and doctors have to deal with truly informed people as well as people who only think they are informed. Worse, much of their continuing education is not much more than paid infomercials, making it hard to trust they are getting truly balanced information.<p>Add to all of this the fact that you have seven minutes with your doctor to work it all out, and it is failing.<p>There are a few things that can be done, IMO, to help:<p>1. The AHA, ADA, AMA, AND and other medical organizations need to stop taking so much money from corporate sponsors.<p>2. Education about and treatment of chronic conditions need to be treated very differently than acute conditions. The treatment for Type 2 diabetes should not default to Metformin.<p>3. We need more time with doctors to work on treatment plans that can be carried out.<p>4. Medical school and continuing education needs far more, unbiased education about the value/dangers of nutrition, environmental contaminants, etc, in chronic disease. Alzheimer&#x27;s prevention starts in a person&#x27;s 30&#x27;s[1].<p>Unfortunately, we see the same kind of care given for stiches as for metabolic syndrome. And it&#x27;s not working.<p>1.

It is a map at the high level. When it comes to the all-important details there are decades of work left at even at the present pace and with the damn impressive biotechnology the research community has now in order to get to even a moderately complete picture.<p>So there&#x27;s a reason why many forms of autoimmunity are really hard to diagnose, and why you&#x27;ll find that a great many diagnoses of exclusion are mild autoimmune conditions: here&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with you, it&#x27;s the bucket we put people in when you have some symptoms and all the tests we have come back negative or with ambiguous results. Those tend to be the ones where nothing can be done at present. The author of the article should at least be happy that she is one step up from that situation.<p>The immune system has so many ways of running awry due to malprogramming that there really should be more work done on more gentle ways to reboot it - strip out all immune cells and start over with the patient&#x27;s stem cells to repopulate it. Aggressive reboot methods involving chemotherapy have been pretty effective when trialed, but that&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d want to do unless there was no alternative.<p>The advent of biologics for immune suppression have turned the research community away from the possibilities of the wipe clean and start over approach, however, which I think might be a mistake in the long run.",1413671816

If you have ~1000 words, ~10 bits/word, seven words is 70 bits, and you lose about 12 of those by allowing reordering, and obviously 10 if you let them flub a word (via a parity word or storing 8 hashes). Seven words could be 48 bits with both kinds of variation allowed, or 58 or 60 with only one kind allowed. It might also help users remember to give them limited choice of code (pick one of 4 or 8 codes, say), which could cost you up to 2-3 more bits (on the paranoid assumption that users will pick according to predictable patterns).<p>How much entropy you target depends on the system. If it needs to work as a crypto key, then you really need entropy, and good luck to you. (Maybe you have folks remember a piece and write a piece down, and use an expensive key scheduley thing to stretch the concatenated result out.) If it&#x27;s for a login system where you can rate-limit, then, hey, even 32 bits is a lot if the attacker has to wait one second between tries.<p>Just realized, if you use a parity word to recover from the user flubbing one word in a login system, you don&#x27;t need to store the cleartext in order to correct the word they missed--you just redo the parity calculation on the remaining words to recover it. Yay. Also, to recover after a parity error in a seven-word phrase, you have to check seven different potential passphrases (assume word 1 was erased, apply parity to recover it, check, repeat), so I guess it takes another three bits off your security on top of the 10 of losing a word.<p>On users just omitting a word all the time if the system lets them, I think 1) you require them to enter the full number of words every time, 2) if you see an error recoverable using parity, first you tell them which word was wrong and ask them to re-enter it, 3) if they still can&#x27;t get it, you tell them what the word was (shoulder-surfer issues obv) and they have to type it. Then you minimize how much you show, you (try to) keep the user from slowly forgetting the passphrase one word at a time, and you make sure that entering your whole passphrase is the fastest way to log in.<p>Though it&#x27;s nice what weird stuff you can do while keeping a hashed cred DB, if it were a login code (not crypto key) and there were big wins to other aspects of the system to keeping the clear version around (for example, it let you do some significantly better error-tolerance strategy), I&#x27;m not sure you have quite the same level of obligation around a random token that you give out specifically for your app as you do around a password the user entrusts you with that they also use elsewhere.",1413671648

Every single frame is encoded from scratch and that means a huge amount of space is wasted. And because of how JPEG works if even a single pixel is different in a macroblock you&#x27;re throwing away most of the compressibility. Even GIF, <i></i>GIF<i></i> has the option of overlaying the previous GIF, which is how it&#x27;s possible to get more than 256 colours in a GIF, among other net little tricks. GIF with even a small measure of dithering makes more sense than this, in all honesty. &quot;GIFs, but better&quot;? That&#x27;s only because you&#x27;re a) not using GIFs right and b) GIFs are terrible, but there&#x27;s worse for the majority of use cases. This is one example.<p>It also means that the browser has to load every single frame of this. If you&#x27;ve got a minute long video with 15 frames per second, that&#x27;s 900 JPEG images in base64 hopping around in memory. Which do you think a tablet would be better at? Playing a minute of H.264, hardware accelerated and all, or shuffling through 900 JPEG images, 15 a second for at least a minute? How about 60 fps and 15 seconds? MPEG has been invented for a reason. Motion estimation is a good thing and has been built into everything since the 90s. Including virtually all mobile browsers, through whatever codec. Sorry, but this at best solves only a UI problem. Something like gifv is a much, much better solution. Also, unless you have the JPEG quantiser set to a wasteful 100, you&#x27;re going to see the maroblock boundaries sitting around there and cutting lines into the picture, each frame differently depending on the quantiser level. I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a neat little hack - just check out the memory usage. And don&#x27;t even get me started on the name - XNG.<p>Using canvas with JavaScript to render something akin to simple MPEG - that would be cool, amazing, brilliant. Finding a way to optimise dithering patterns within a GIF to minimise frame sizes would be absolutely fascinating. This is terrible.<p>This is not a format problem. Hell, storing a movie in three different actual formats next to each other to get browser support for everything would waste less space than a single file of this. This is a UI problem at worst.<p>If you want to use SVG for animations, go nuts. By all means. But never use it for anything like what I&#x27;m seeing here - actual videos instead of animations.<p>The only use I can see for XNG that leaves it at least an order of magnitude as good as something else is if each frame shares almost nothing in common with the previous frame and is a full actual picture. But even then MPEG-1 with every frame a keyframe would do about just as well. gfycat and gifv are perfectly fine and superior on almost every level (apart from maybe the UI on esoteric devices x y or z that also somehow have a fast processor and a lot of RAM) than this.<p>tl;dr: 60% CPU usage and a memory leak pushing my Chrome past a GB and that&#x27;s just the start of it.",1413671630

The audible spectrum spans from 2E1 to 2E4 Hz and those difference in wavelenghts make for different behaviors in rooms, not to mention the challenges of accurately modeling diffraction and diffusion.  Computer modelling largely is still brute force, where rays are randomly drawn from a source in hopes of eventually finding a receiver&#x27;s location in the room before reaching inaudibility.

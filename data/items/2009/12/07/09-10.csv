I once was on a study week on historical mathematical games with several historians of mathematics, and even we got bored of the game after an evening.\nIt is designed to teach a certain medieval conception of composed numbers and not to be playable, so there are for example several pieces that are very hard to take by normal rules, because the opposite players has no pieces that combine to the required number for taking it.",1260179803

You're presenting me with a very short blob of technical gibberish on each item and then you're essentially asking me to guess at the answer.<p>The best-case result of this is a scientifically (i.e. in the sense of empirical social sciences) awkward set of answers but I fail to see how they would carry any predictive value.<p>Just because everyone believes the world will be hit by a meteor in 2012 does not make it happen.",1260179664

THe problem was trivial, but I got shunted around, told to try all the crappy shovelware shit they'd put on the PC that I'd uninstalled, etc.<p>XP's built-in CD burning just plain failed to work. Dell support tried to tell me that the CD-ROM drive was not compatible with XP's CD burning (totally nonsense).\nI even had to give them my credit card number to sign up for their software support (as well as the cash I'd paid for next-day hardware support), because ""it might be a software problem, so you have to pay for software support.""  At least they had the decency to refund that.<p>They'd established (or rather, I had) that the drive was faulty, so they wanted to mail me a drive and I could fit it.  As I'd paid for next-day on-site warranty I told them they could take a running jump.<p>Next day, hardware guy turns up, replaces drive in about 10 minutes, fixing the problem.<p>A WHOLE DAY on the phone.  I've never bought Dell support again.",1260178240

I'd start with sciweavers ( <a href=""http://www.sciweavers.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciweavers.org/</a> ), since they have a lot of readable, new papers, but the vast majority of the references are fairly math-heavy and somewhat removed from the applications.

Imagemagick source ( <a href=""http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php</a> ) is also amazing for learning how basic operations are done in code.<p>Learning to read the style of older research papers and to pull applications out of them is very useful though.

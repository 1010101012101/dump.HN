9246202,comment,9245988,9246102,0,0,fab13n,,,"Bullshitness is not an all-or-nothing quality for jobs, that&#x27;s part of why they&#x27;re so hard to get rid of. You can find some justification to every job, but this justification can be dubious, or can not be worth the cost in human energy or social side effects.<p>Most jobs are somewhat bullshitty not because they solve no problem, but because they solve it in grossly contrived and ineffective way. That can be crushing, when you realize you&#x27;re a cog in a Rube Goldberg contraption.<p>To take your example, private insurance against life-threatening events is very difficult to make effective through free markets: you need so many regulations to define what&#x27;s cheating and prevent it (which criterions a company can discriminate against, preexisting conditions,  transparency...) that you end up with a cost/effectiveness ratio even worse than that of mandatory, state operated systems from Europe.<p>There are also many jobs which are zero-sum games: if you do marketing or advertising on a non-elastic market, the job you do luring your competitors&#x27; customers is undone by the person doing the same job on your competitors&#x27; payrolls. It&#x27;s, plain and simple, an arms race, and it&#x27;s as wasteful as the USA/USSR one. Those jobs exist because markets aren&#x27;t good enough at reaching multilateral disarmament agreements (except against customers&#x27; interests, as oligopolies).<p>More generally speaking, free markets are a stochastic optimization system that&#x27;s (1) very slowly converging, which means an awful lot of resources are spent slowly crawling towards an optimum (2) pretty bad at escaping local optima and (3) navigating  a space full of negative singularities (monopolies). We&#x27;re stuck with a lot of bullshit jobs because they&#x27;re doing OK at micro-optimization, but they&#x27;re often quite bad at macro-optimization.",1427018323

9246200,comment,9245467,9245467,0,0,jamesjardine,,,"First a disclaimer: I am the founder of Qiqqa.com, which I wrote while doing my PhD at the University of Cambridge, and without which, I quite literally would have failed to complete my PhD.<p>I believe the key statement that has been iterated over and over here is that only 10% of scientific papers are ever worth reading.  And probably only 10% of the text of those 10% are worth reading.  They are they 1%.<p>This means that you end up with hundreds (if not thousands) of papers that you think you might have to read, but have no way of knowing whether or not you should until you have read them.  Chicken meet egg.<p>I built Qiqqa (and wrote a PhD) to solve this from two broad directions: using human intelligence and using artificial intelligence.<p>USING HUMAN INTELLIGENCE: While a load of people recommend printing out a paper to read it, I believe that that course leads to a lot of future pain.  Highlighting and annotating while you read is absolutely important.  It allows you to skim through a paper and highlight only the important stuff.  Then you can come back later to properly read the important papers – only once you have skimmed enough papers to get a more general sense of the domain you are exploring.  If you have printed out papers, it is very difficult to quickly regroup and reread your annotated papers.  However, if you have highlighted your papers on your computer, laptop, tablet (or even phone while travelling from Cambridge to London), free products like Qiqqa (or www.pdfhighlights.com) offers you a simple annotation report to pull out all your annotations to not only remind you of what and where the important fact are, but also to let to jump straight to them to get reading immediately.<p>USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: An interesting side effect of reading more scientific research is that the more you read, the more you have left to read.  Every paper you end up reading will make reference to another few papers that you probably should read; like The Magic Porridge Pot.  To solve the problem of ‘what should I read next’ (the working title of my  PhD), I built into Qiqqa the capability for it to ‘automatically read the papers for you’ using machine learning.  To this end, when reading a paper, Qiqqa can recommend to you the most relevant papers to read using something called Topical PageRank which calculates the relevance of a paper to what you are reading not only by its similarity to what you are reading, but also by how well received (cited) that paper is in your community.  Think of it as having your own personal Google where it biases results to satisfy your personal predilections.  You can read about how it works at <a href=""http://aclanthology.info/papers/topical-pagerank-a-model-of-scientific-expertise-for-bibliographic-search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aclanthology.info/papers/topical-pagerank-a-model-of-...</a>.<p>Good luck with your research!

9246156,comment,9245988,9245988,0,0,fsloth,,,"The way I understand it is this (sorry,a bit long winded):<p>The world is run by gigantic bureaucracies and owners of capital - who all value continuity and predictability above all else. Given that the world has historically been a madhouse of crazy, and most of us are doing <i>materially</i> better than before, it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint exactly what would be wrong with these priorities. &quot;May you live in interesting times&quot; is a curse, and for a good reason.<p>Sadly, a specific vehicle of stability and predictability is disengaging most adults from the majority of their waking hours. After the maslovian needs of food, sex and shelter are fullfilled the average 9-5 desk job does not seem to provide in average fulfillment for the higher level needs.<p>One element of establishing stablity is organizing work in the large scale in industrial taylorian fashion where the labor input of the individual <i>position</i> is predictable. The easiest way to do this is to divide the work of the organization to small enough pieces so that individual work responsibilities are easy to communicate, transfer and, perhaps even more important, <i>measure</i>. Small, piecemeal duties are often felt as non-important since they are so simple to perform and thus not mentally fulfilling.<p>The three stages of engagement from best to worst are commitment, compliance, conflict - most employers are satisfied by compliance, and one of the easiest ways to statistically enforce compliance is through observing the work directly or through reports: thus we get the endless reporting. The reason this works even if no-one is reading the reports 24/7 is that most people are extremely uncomfortable with cognitive dissonance of doing one thing and saying the other, and usually align their actions with their reporting.<p>Thus we get the disengaged, prozac-crunching desk jokey of the early 21st century.<p>I think the best leaders recognize the critical difference between commitment and compliance for organizational output. Thus we get the start-ups &quot;we want only passionate people here&quot; spiel - they aim for organizational commitment from composing the organization from atomic committed individuals.

Personally I find spelling the word this way is a bit offensive. It&#x27;s as if you are saying you want to use it, but you know it is wrong, so you will just slightly use it.",1427015191

Take the list from the article itself, one of the &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; listed is actuary. Well, without actuaries, insurance would not be priced correctly, and would be prohibitively expensive or too cheap and insurance companies would go out of business. Either way, insurance would be less available than it is today.<p>And what does a world with less insurance look like? Insurance lets people trade a small amount of money for protection against a loss of a life-ruining amount of money. Without health insurance or fire insurance, people have to save up as much money as they can in the case of a catastrophic accident which they probably won&#x27;t have, and possibly declining to spend that money on important things like higher education, etc. And when people are underinsured, they&#x27;re constantly in a state of baseline anxiety, worry about &quot;what ifs.&quot;<p>Is that the world this author wants to live in? One where he&#x27;s constantly worrying about what might happen if he gets sick? That&#x27;s not a world I want.",1427015015

Still, as I originally assumed, I confirmed that gcc with `-Wall -Werror -std=c99` flags won&#x27;t compile an initialization of a &quot;struct seagull * &quot; with a value of type &quot;struct enemy * &quot;, or passing a mismatch of those types to a function.  If those would be the main reasons to use C++, I&#x27;d personally rather just use C with extra checks.

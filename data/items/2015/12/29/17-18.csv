Almost all sales are finalized before the floor plan term is up, so there is no out of pocket cost to the dealer up front.<p>Dealers <i>can</i> return vehicles to the auction in some cases (for a fee), but usually that&#x27;s only in the case of the auction itself being misleading (not disclosing prior major repair, salvage title status, or things like that).",1451411702

So maybe all of this is semantic, and a bit far afield of Scott&#x27;s original post.<p>Privilege is an important concept: many people, however, elevate it to a metaphysical reality, instead of a set of cultural practices and institutions situated in a particular social context. The idea seems to be there&#x27;s white and black, male and female, rich and poor, and that set of binary relations is defined by membership in a hardcoded hierarchy of oppression. Even &quot;intersectionality,&quot; which most everyone is already familiar with, in practice seems to be mostly about &quot;there are lots of checkboxes you can check, and you&#x27;ll always have some that are checked and some that aren&#x27;t!&quot; More sophisticated takes on it acknowledge the incommensurability of experience and use that to condemn oppression olympics[0], but it falls prey to a core problem.<p>Privilege ends up being a very leaky abstraction. &quot;White privilege&quot; (privilege itself, not the term) is a modern invention: white privilege didn&#x27;t exist in 1500, because white people and black people didn&#x27;t exist in 1500. Race was constructed in the early modern era to provide the ideological superstructure for the pattern of colonialism and domination originating from the western coast of the Eurasian landmass. And the strange fruits of its maturation in the late 19th century remain with us to this very day, to the extent that in the vast majority of contexts, you&#x27;re better off being white than black. So I&#x27;m very comfortable with using a monolithic white privilege as an explanatory concept when talking strictly about black-white race relations.<p>Even that, though, breaks down when you consider the multiplicity of races: you no longer can have a simple binary of the oppressed and the oppressors, because you have to account for East Asian, Native American, South Asian, etc. experiences as well. You can try to bundle all of them together and talk about &quot;white privilege over nonwhites,&quot; but that&#x27;s pretty problematic itself, because it reduces all non-white racial experience to simply being the Other. Or you can come up with a whole set of racial binaries--white and Asian, white and black, white and non-white Hispanic--which respects the unique discourse that defines each race, but runs into issues when you start talking about, for example, black-Asian relations. I don&#x27;t think this at all undermines the usefulness of white privilege as a concept, but it&#x27;s a very subtle concept.<p>The point of all of this prelude? Even in the simple case of one clearly dominant group, treating white privilege as a monolith is tricky, though I think ultimately it&#x27;s doable in a way that&#x27;s useful and powerful. But that brings me to my main point: male-female privilege, which nowadays is better characterized as male privileges and female privileges, though in the past it was very one-sided. The current discourse of privilege, however, is unable to account for that complicated reality, because it insists on parts of each individual&#x27;s identity being classed into a binary of oppressed and oppressors. And because of that, it very much discredits people&#x27;s real struggles. It categorically rejects the possibility that men suffer systemic oppression based on their maleness. Men who fall outside the male archetype, in body, personality, or how they are socially situated, are marginalized and face economic and social discrimination. And even men who manage to fall within the narrow scope of our society&#x27;s hegemonic masculinity suffer a great deal due to it, resulting in harrowing statistics like men comprising 3/4 of successful suicides.<p>At worst, the response to this from activists is nastiness, mockery, and derision (&quot;I drink male tears!&quot;). Sometimes the response is saying that that sucks, but it&#x27;s not systemic oppression so it&#x27;s not worth worrying about, or maybe that men committing the large majority of suicides is bad but it&#x27;s different in scale from the oppression every woman experiences. Best is the more empathetic and sophisticated ones who cite &quot;toxic masculinity&quot;, which is fine as far as it goes: it acknowledges that men suffer based on their gender, and I can enthusiastically be allies with people who recognize that. But it strikes me as trying to fit the square peg of oppressive male gender roles into the round hole of privilege. For point of comparison, consider how ridiculous something like &quot;toxic whiteness&quot; or &quot;toxic affluenza&quot; sounds. But otherwise there&#x27;s no way for privilege discourse to acknowledge that there&#x27;s anything at all that sucks about being expected to perform masculinity.<p>So, that ended up being quite the essay. But thanks if you read it!<p>[0] Though, isn&#x27;t &quot;acknowledging the distress while continuing to point out the difference in scale&quot; really just oppression olympics under a different name? Or does this come from the point of view that oppression olympics is a valid intellectual exercise, but isn&#x27;t useful tactically while collaborating with diverse sets of people?",1451411560

In the UK, the records <i>are</i> compiled nationally and are beyond question. There have been three fatal police shootings here in 2015; all of them were front-page national news.<p>The US keeps no such records, and until <a href=""http://killedbypolice.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://killedbypolice.net/</a> began compiling credible news reports, <i>nobody</i> was keeping national records.  The numbers on killedbypolice.net are therefore an absolute <i>minimum</i> for how many people are killed by police in America. Killings which are not well-documented in the news aren&#x27;t included. If the number is inaccurate, then the picture in America is even worse.<p>Undoubtedly many of them are justified. America is awash in guns, and if somebody is shooting at you, then undoubtedly you have the right to shoot back. However only 48% of those who were killed had a firearm on or near them (it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they were using it).[1] Many of the remainder are classified as being &quot;armed&quot;, but that includes cases like this mentally ill man who was killed for holding a screwdriver in an unthreatening manner[2], so those numbers should be considered suspect. Finally, there are hundreds of killings every year of people who cannot be considered &quot;armed&quot; by any definition. Many of these are well-documented on video; if you want to spend the next few hours watching snuff films, they&#x27;re easy enough to find.<p>The punishment for the overwhelming majority of these killings is a paid vacation for the murderer.<p>Something is desperately wrong with America.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/0...</a><p>2: <a href=""https://www.rt.com/usa/252533-dallas-screwdriver-shooting-jury/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rt.com/usa/252533-dallas-screwdriver-shooting-ju...</a>",1451411083

So what am I doing writing a web app in a Lisp like language unless i really enjoy thinking about algorithms more than UX... What matters to me is having a good modern language with large enough eco system and that I could use to build kick ass UX. Modern JS and React-Flux-Immutable suffice.

It&#x27;s tougher for DFZ transit to do it because they must know, and programmatically configure, all downstream space to be whitelisted. Now you have a similar conversation to BGP filtering when downstream networks change space, and that&#x27;s huge administrative overhead (which is why announcements are just trusted without filtering at the higher levels, to avoid this overhead for the larger AS). Your end network is a better place because you know your assigned space better, as well as how you number it; you might be holding half an /18 and not assigning it, whereas your peer would whitelist it all, for example.<p>If the technicals of the Internet were programmatically available in a sane way (PeeringDB doesn&#x27;t count here, since it just automates manual work), the Tier 1s could potentially automate against their downstream AS&#x27; space and enable your (mostly correct) point.

You&#x27;re worse off in the NYC burbs in in many cases, one would think it would be the opposite but it&#x27;s not. The amount of money it takes to break out of the middle class quality of life is more around 400k per year for the NYC tri-state area. In the burbs the houses are not nice or good for the price, they&#x27;re overpriced and property taxes are outrageous- property taxes can actually be worse in the suburbs than they are for a Manhattan condo or coop. The commute is also a killer, while Metro North is somewhat reliable and on-time relative to other rail systems, the length of the commute is just brutal. At least while you&#x27;re paying more per square foot in NYC you do get some convenience out of it, although this gets more complicated if you have kids. If you&#x27;ve got to worry about education for children, you MUST buy a coop/condo in a NYC district with good zoned schools, this isn&#x27;t common and those district command the highest prices per square foot. If you can&#x27;t afford those districts your looking at private school for the kids, and that runs 30-40k, somewhat less if you choose a Catholic school but still a huge chunk of your budget. Trust me, there are places you don&#x27;t want your kids going to public school- and I&#x27;m not talking safety, this is in regards to the piss-poor quality of the education.

Here are some examples from the article:<p>1.<p>Mr. Loeb, for example, has invested in a Bermuda-based reinsurer — an insurer to insurance companies — that turns around and invests the money in his hedge fund. That maneuver transforms his profits from short-term bets in the market, which the government taxes at roughly 40 percent, into long-term profits, known as capital gains, which are taxed at roughly half that rate. It has had the added advantage of letting Mr. Loeb defer taxes on this income indefinitely, allowing his wealth to compound and grow more quickly.<p>2.<p>One aggressive strategy is to place income in a type of charitable trust, generating a deduction that offsets the income tax. The trust then purchases what’s known as a private placement life insurance policy, which invests the money on a tax-free basis, frequently in a number of hedge funds. The person’s heirs can inherit, also tax-free, whatever money is left after the trust pays out a percentage each year to charity, often a considerable sum.",1451409755

If I had not tried I would be wondering \nfor the rest of my life what would have happened. I am quite happy that I will not regret not trying.<p>2 - Every application process I tried, year after year, I noticed that I was getting better. I was better in interviews and my professional and academic track record were improving on the last years.<p>3 - Due to the application process I met a lot of people and made some new friends. And they are very impressive guys.  Hence, my network has been enhanced.<p>4- It is clearer for me now my strengths and my weaknesses. Knowing what I need to improve is great. Getting this &quot;no&quot; is an excellent way of reducing the asymmetrical information between my perception about myself and what other people think about me.<p>5 - Self-knowledge is something weird.<p>Really difficult to measure, usually with little or no science when people\ntalk about it and absolutely important.<p>This &quot;no&#x27;s&quot; that I received were the best (and the hardest) way I have ever experienced to improve my self-knowledge.<p>6 - The process did not change much from 2013 to 2015. I was also older on the third try. But a funny (and IMHO cool) thing is that my preparation was better and harder year after year.<p>I put a lot of effort every time I tried. And this increased. I read books, searched for info on the Internet, rehearsed, created a notebook for self-assessment and spent many hours thinking about how I could pass.\nMy preparation was definitely over the demand.<p>7 - I have a few idols. Two of them are Americans: Michael Jordan and Bob Knight. Jordan used to say: I do not accept not trying. And bob knight used to say: the will to succeed is important, but more important is the will to prepare.<p>I am in peace with the philosophy that two of my idols used to preach.<p>8 - I took lessons from it.<p>Hope you guys have enjoyed reading this long answer. My English writing has been a little rusty, sorry for the minor mistakes.",1451409330

What changes, if any, have you made in response to the June Re/Code article accusing Product Hunt of being elitist?<p>2. You said &quot;all upvotes are equal&quot; in the Medium article as evidence that Product Hunt is fair. Would you say that the binary process of get-on-homepage/do-not-get-on-homepage is just as fair?<p>3. Whenever someone on Product Hunt upvotes a product, their friends receive a notification saying &quot;X and Y others upvoted Z&quot; with a link to Z. Does this call-to-action skew the upvoting process in favor of people with strong social groups on PH?<p>4. Do you believe that the current product curation process is meritocratic, that is the best products, <i>on their individual merit</i>, are the ones that are on the front page?<p>5. As a hypothetical maker trying to get my product onto Product Hunt, would my time be better spent Tweeting and chatting on Slack with Top Hunters or by improving the product itself?<p>6. Do makers who schedule exclusive launches with the Product Hunt team and offer PH-specific perks get favorable treatment in terms of ranking/exposure? Would this be considered a &quot;conflict of interest&quot;?<p>7. The new &quot;conflicts of interest&quot; section of the FAQ notes that they should be disclosed in good faith. In the case where a conflict of interest is blatant, such as when a venture capitalist submits a startup they funded (as an casual observer, I notice this happens <i>all the time</i>), are you willing to penalize the investor/submission and force disclosure?<p>Thank you for your time.<p>Max W.\n@minimaxir",1451409032

It&#x27;s funny how many people ignore franchices like that for their political screeds because the casts aren&#x27;t human.<p>Heck, you could say Super Mario Bros 2 had a &#x27;female hero&#x27;, because it was the first game to have Peach go from being a damsel in distress to playable character.<p>Or the numerous games where you choose the gender (and general appearance) of the main character.  It&#x27;s pretty common in Western made RPGS, and it&#x27;s getting about as common in Eastern ones (Pokemon has this since gen 2).  How about games where there&#x27;s a party of people and some/most of them are female?<p>I find this attitude that female characters are somehow a &#x27;new&#x27; thing for gaming being rather unfair, and find the attempts of trying to then mix in crap like &#x27;gaming&#x27;s war on women&#x27; as even worse.",1451408467

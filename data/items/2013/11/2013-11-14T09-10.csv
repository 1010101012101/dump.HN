Against inexperienced players, projecting confidence can sometimes make them miss the fact that you made a mistake. However, against strong experienced players they will almost always notice and take advantage of mistakes, confidence and psychology will not factor into it.<p>Notice, for example, how the top AI players are now pretty much unbeatable by humans. They don&#x27;t make use of any psychological tricks but play purely rationally -- read up about min-max and decision/game theory for a general framework for how such AI is written.",1384423180

ECMAScript 6 will likely correct some of these flaws, but the necessity for backward compatibility continues to be a stumbling block.  Dart is a clean break and fresh slate while retaining a familiar syntax and interoperability/compatibility.<p>Is it a long shot that it will unseat Javascript?  Sure.  But, competition is good for JavaScript.  Google&#x27;s number one interest is in improvement across the entire client side web app infrastructure since its business is built upon it.

But I&#x27;m saying I suspect the risk of a lateral pass can be much lower than generally accepted because you can almost guarantee a pass completion by doing it right.  In rugby, in open play, it&#x27;s also very risky to loose the ball when attempting a lateral pass. The opponents can then gain possession and attack while your defensive line is not in place properly. So dropping the lateral pass is also very risky.  But rugby solves that risk by making sure lateral passes are dropped very seldom (watch a top level game and see.  Around 5 turnovers per team are because of a lateral pass that&#x27;s dropped, if that much).",1384421759

I <i>especially</i> like that it&#x27;s fully compatible with the existing http.HandlerFunc interface, which is a big deal. This means you can just write &quot;regular&quot; handlers as middleware (or bring them over from existing code) without having to reinvent the wheel.<p>I also very much like the way it leaves sessions up to you. A few other Go frameworks leverage http.Cookie, instead of letting you use something like gorilla/sessions.

For an ECG to work, you have to make good electrical contact with your skin near your heart, and some people feel this is potentially dangerous. Actually, some people like to argue about how dangerous it actually is, as seen on Hack-A-Day comments and my previous post comments. Some people have suggested the danger is negligible and pointed-out that its similar to inserting ear-bud headphones into your ears. Others have suggested that its dangerous and pointed-out that milliamps can kill a person. Others contest that pulses of current are far more dangerous than a continuous applied current. Realists speculate that virtually no current would be delivered by this circuit if it is wired properly. Rational, cautionary people worried about it reduce risk of accidental current by applying bidirectional diodes at the level of the chest leads, which short any current (above 0.7V) similar to that shown here. Electrically-savvy folks would design an optically decoupled solution. Intelligent folks who abstain from arguing on the internet would probably consult the datasheets regarding ECG input protection. In all cases, dont attach electrical devices to your body unless you are confident in their safety. As a catch-all, I present the ECG circuit for educational purposes only, and state that it may not be safe and should not be replicated  There, will that cover me in court in case someone tapes wires to their chest and plugs them in the wall socket?",1384420492

Bitcoin is not broken while being in the open for plenty of people to exploit it. Just like anyone interested may try to synthesise gold at a cost lower than the market price.<p>2. Every early venture is also very volatile. Facebook, Twitter, Google, the web itself and the internet were volatile in the beginning. A lot of uncertainties, legal issues, security issues etc. Only when they reach half of the potential market, they start looking stable and glorious. I bet when gold was started to be used as a currency it was uncertain, competing with previous currencies and prices were fluctuating a lot.<p>3. Bitcoin can&#x27;t be suddenly worth 1$ tomorrow for economic reasons. Only for technical reasons (but then it is more likely to become worthless). Economically, no big holder of bitcoin is going to crash the price by cashing out publicly if there is a way to sell steadily and/or privately. Which happens already. SecondMarket&#x27;s BIT gets all its coins and money purely privately, without anyone noticing much changes.<p>Since almost no one is holding Bitcoin-denomitated debts, no one is hurt by having Bitcoin price <i>rising</i> unexpectedly. It only boosts interest. So if it stays around $430 for the months or grows to $1000, no one will be hugely disappointed. Even if drops now to $300, only a fraction of holders will suffer losses, while majority of others is still well in profit.",1384419800

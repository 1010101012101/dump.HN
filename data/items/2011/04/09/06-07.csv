I'd downvote it for appealing to base emotion in a situation where we must rely on reason and <i>nothing</i> <i>else</i>. Chernobyl was a tragedy.

2426678,comment,2425460,2425827,2,0,beej71,,,"> If Google is going to exploit ""open source"" as a marketing term and claim at Google IO that it's trying to prevent a ""draconian future,"" it shouldn't be withholding its source code from non-privileged partners and making licensees sign non-fragmentation clauses that give Google final approval over source changes.<p>IMHO, for a for-profit company, they're doing a really great job of keeping the source open, especially when compared to their competition.  And remember how open they are required to be, which is ""not at all"".  They could stop releasing source tomorrow, and, short of feeling morally superior, there is nothing anyone could do about it.<p>Is Google open by RMS's standards?  If we just jump there, we can settle the terminology issue on the spot.  No, they are not open, so now we can just work with what we have, which is ""some open source under different licenses, and a lot of closed source"".<p>But if someone doesn't like the restrictions on Android, they do have the option to fork it into a new OS.  That's the open source deal, and Rubin spelled out the details in a tweet that a great many people made fun of at the time, but turned out to accurately describe their stance.  Use the kernel source under the GPL's terms; use the trademark and store and non-GPL'd source under Google's terms.<p>When Justice gets involved, there are problems, for sure.  But saying, ""Hey, you can't use our trademark while pimping our main competitor's product, and if you do pimp our main competitor's product, don't expect us to be in a rush to show you our in-progress code"" doesn't strike me as particularly horrific behavior.  But that's just my opinion.<p>The big question is: would Android be a coherent platform without Google's restrictions?  And if not, would Google even work on it?",1302331465

I understand the need for a useful, technical education, but sometimes I think we overestimate how much useful, technical skills can be gained from classroom instruction v. the real world.

After going head to head on prices for so long, Best Buy decided to raise their prices and better train their staff and service.  If people know what they want, they can find it on Amazon, or New Egg, or somewhere online for cheaper than Best Buy can offer, often because of the sales tax exemption in buying from out of state vendors.  What Best Buy discovered is that people come into Best Buy when they don't know what they want.  When they need to ask a few questions and get some recommendations.  Then they figure, ""I might as well buy it while I'm here"" and pay a little premium for it.",1302331112

Short-sleeved linen shirts feel really cool in hot weather, really nice.<p>You absolutely shouldn't wear clothes you don't feel comfortable in. However, wearing a t-shirt <i>because</i> it's an act of rebellion doesn't work for me at all. If you're wearing t-shirts because you want to, then fine.<p>Wearing smart clothes is not something I do, or my colleagues do, to fit in. I work in a university and often we are the only people (6?) in a department of 200 people under the age of 60 in formal clothes. They feel comfy and they look good. People also find them intimidating, which can be funny.<p>So long as you dress how you want, that's cool. I just find the idea of wearing free, logo-infested clothes a bit unappealing. I come across an attitude of 'I wear t-shirts because I don't have to wear a suit!' pretty regularly; I find it sad because it's being constrained in your dress by those standards in the opposite way to the suits but not even acknowledging it!

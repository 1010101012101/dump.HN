The problem is that you&#x27;re only looking at the small part of the problem which you understand better than the average person. Think about it instead from the perspective of the ice cream shop owner: they&#x27;re not making any money from your using the network.<p>You might look at the a Facebook captive portal and think it&#x27;s a poor choice but your solution isn&#x27;t optimized for the business needs: cheap, reliable, doesn&#x27;t require much staff time to support or special skills.<p>This particular problem is really a tech industry market failure, as there&#x27;s never been a serious attempt to build a federated authentication system because the general trend has been trying to force a closed system on the world with the goal of levying a tax later. The most successful attempt was OpenID which was fundamentally mis-designed – inexplicably using URLs instead of email addresses – and quickly derailed by the gratuitous complexity crowd. There&#x27;s a chance we might see things change with Persona but … I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb and guess that this won&#x27;t happen quickly and, even if it does, it&#x27;s going to be hard to find many developers willing to turn down a Facebook-scale salary to work on a turn-key level captive portal system priced at what an ice-cream shop can afford to pay.",1389135139

When you accelerate, the chair rotates backwards, and gravity does the work of pushing you back in your seat. The faster you accelerate, the more the chair leans back.

Even at normal enterprise scale :)<p>Git solves it through kind of distributed scaling where many operations can be performed on local physical repos without ever hitting the central. With centralized solutions, like Perforce, Mercurial, etc... most of the operations are performed on central server and your ability to scale vertically hits the ceiling pretty soon.<p>Compare the simplest case - each dev updating his local workspace/repo would hit the central server in Perforce where is with Git you can (and normally would have) a small set of downstream repos which the updates would be propagated/distributed through. You can branch left and right in Git in your local and team&#x27;s repos without &quot;master&quot; repo and &quot;central&quot; server involved (while all your branch activity in Perforce is happening right on the central server in the central repo).

I call bullshit on that.<p>Do you mean they&#x27;re less at risk of poverty than a black person who grows up in typical black subculture?  Of course they are.<p><a href""http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/rich-black-flunking/Content?oid=107045"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/rich-black-flunking/Co...</a><p>Allow me to give you a little insight into my insight.  I live in the ghetto, in a place that is 75% black, in the deep South.  I grew up here, I still live here, and I know the people.  They&#x27;re typically good people, but as a whole, they don&#x27;t have the same mindset about work, about frugality, about financial success that your <i>typical</i> middle class white guy does.  And the reason isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;re black per se - it has nothing to do with their skin color, with their race.  It does, however, have everything do with their culture, and it&#x27;s not racist in the slightest to acknowledge that!  If you don&#x27;t acknowledge a problem, how can you ever hope to fix it?<p>Allow me to enlighten you a little bit.  A people are brought to a foreign land and forced to work.  Their culture that they knew is destroyed, so they build another one, but as any people who&#x27;ve been subjugated will do, they develop a strong resentment towards those who subjugate them and they integrate that sentiment into their new culture.  They see the entire establishment as the creation of their oppressors, of their <i>enemy</i>, and for a long time, they were right!  Post-slavery, racism was rampant, and it was damn hard to be a black person in America.  I don&#x27;t blame them one bit for initially thumbing their noses at the system that &#x27;whitey&#x27; built, for telling us to fuck off, for generally believing deep down in their soul that white people were their arch enemies.<p>But times have changed.  Yes, racism still exists (it exists everywhere, and is arguably the mildest in the USA, believe it or not), but post the civil rights movement and affirmative action, there is really no excuse for anyone - man, woman, white, black, whatever - to decide to be a leech on society.  Well, outside of permanent disability, of course.  Opportunity exists for everyone, and if you&#x27;re a black person, it exists even more so for you.  There are a plethora of excellent black-only schools which take low-income black kids who show a willingness to work hard to succeed.  MIT absolutely loves to give free rides to the underprivileged minorities, as it improves their diversity figures, and the same goes for just about every college.  We have a black guy as our President, for pete&#x27;s sake.  The difference was that his parents raised him to embrace the establishment, not to rebel against it.  They taught him to follow the rules, to work hard, to join &#x27;our&#x27; system and to change it from the inside, if he so pleased.  And he did.  A black guy.<p>Finally, acknowledging that a subculture is different from your own isn&#x27;t racist.  You&#x27;re just a dumbass.",1389134026

Two lessons from that experience that I thought I&#x27;d pass on:<p>- I&#x27;ve found it a more flexible architecture to separate the send functionality off from your email object itself and into its own service class. So instead of doing email.Send(), you do emailService.Send(email). The content of an email, and how to send that content, are separate responsibilities.  Separating the two also allows for alternate implementations of the Send functionality: one (like here) that does a synchronous SMTP transfer, one that might drop the message into an internal queue so that client code doesn&#x27;t need to wait for the (potentially fairly slow) SMTP transfer, one that simply appends to a local file for debugging, etc.  (These are all examples from real apps.)<p>- Have you considered making required properties (to, from, subject) properties of the constructor? Doing so makes guaranteeing that they&#x27;re set a compile-time check rather than a runtime check, which can make a library more robust and suss out bugs earlier.",1389133232

The dev kit also has very visible pixels, which gives it a substantial screen door effect, and there&#x27;s some blur when turning your head.

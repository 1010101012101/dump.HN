2753331,comment,2753115,2753115,15,0,lojack,,,"I've seen multiple variations of similar requests. It seems that there's two separate problems that need to be addressed. There's the broadcasters problem where people want to broadcast information only to select groups of people. Facebook has taken a stab at this, Google+ has done it much better, and the concept is merely Public/Private for Twitter.<p>Then there's the subscriber problem where people want to read relevant information on a specific topic. This problem only seems to exist when connections only need to go in one direction, i.e. following. Here users want to be able to view posts on specific subjects by those with ""celebrity"" type persona's. Twitter solves this (IMO, poorly) with the use of hashtags and multiple accounts. The hashtags don't solve this problem completely because you can't subscribe to a specific user's hashtag. I don't personally care that @pydanny is drunk at a wedding with Audrey, but I'm super interested in his DjangoCon talk. I also don't care about Joe Schmoe learned the power of decorators in his #django views.<p>To me, tags don't seem like the right approach because of the reasons above. I personally like the concept of ""Channels"". Users can create any number of channels for whatever they want to post about. When you are adding a user to your circle, you can select which channels you'd like to subscribe to. Then when they post they can select which channel the post is relevant to. Now, some of you may say: Whats the difference between this and tagging? Well, the distinguishing factor is that you need to create channels prior to posting to them. It forces users to categorize their subjects consistently, and it allows subscribers specific choices on what they'd like to see.",1310438722

Given the context, ""those who do not themselves produce"" means MBAs?  I've got an MBA (and an MSEE) and am a CTO, and I think people think I can produce.  Of course, there are useless people who graduate with every degree imaginable.  MBAs happen to have graduated too many people and have gotten a bunch of focus over the past decade, so are rightly getting their ration of shit, but that's not about the notion of an MBA being useless; it's about oversupply and under-quality.<p>Also, I assume you meant ""those who <i>did</i> not themselves produce"" because one of the most frustrating things about management is that you don't get to produce much.

Because running a business <i>is</i> something people do and is has very specific rules, regulations, mechanics, knowledge, etc.  Accounting and finance <i>do</i> matter (a lot) and products, people and ideas <i>do</i> fail because they neglect to understand these things.  But business studies are cross-functional/domain: I took the ""core"" stuff, but I also took great classes on control system theory for business (""system dynamics""), industrial economics, strategy, technology strategy, organizational processes, finance (NPV, capital structure anyone?).  These types of knowledge give you a very different (and, hopefully, more effective) perspective on what businesses are and how they operate.<p>Computer science doesn't mean anything in a vacuum either.

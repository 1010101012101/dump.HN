Only if you can already afford gold-plated child-care, then you get the additional Google subsidy and proximity. If the copayment is too dear, you wind up getting no subsidy, and your children wind up farther away.<p>It's like welfare for the already-well-off, which excludes the most needy.",1215280387

If this is <i>all</i> that ""religious faith"" means to you, then I would argue you're not particularly religious. Of course religion can be defined in various ways, but to call a belief system ""religion"" that has no concept of an omniscient, omnipotent Creator who has any sort of direct influence on peoples' lives so dilutes the meaning of that word that you're left with a tautology -- religion means whatever you feel about things that can't be explained by science.",1215279787

Either way, they're hidden.<p>Look at the photo spread: it lists ""Famous Agnostics/Atheists"", as if they're the same thing, but at least half are arguably agnostic:<p>- Darwin: self-described agnostic; claimed he had ""never been an athiest""<p>- Einstein: ""My position concerning God is that of an agnostic.""<p>- Edison: apparently a lifelong agnostic<p>- Gates: can't find a clear statement, but said in an interview ""I don't know if there's a god or not""<p>Look at the article itself: there's no mention of agnosticism at all.  They're simply using a photo of a famous agnostic to bolster an argument about atheism.<p>I believe that a lot of us who are (and rightfully claim to be) agnostic are being labeled ""atheist"" by people who don't know or care.",1215279547

I don't think you can really call a computer a ""tool"" anymore, anyway. It is the communication, entertainment, and productivity center of many people's lives. It serves far more value than a hammer or a pen. It has the ability to morph into practically anything. Back in 1995, when the real value of a computer was still somewhat ambiguous, people called them tools because that was the closest metaphor to a a familiar paradigm. Today, the computer is the paradigm.<p>The argument this guy uses is kind of stupid and reminds me of the short-sighted, extremely stubborn attitude of the most geeky people I know. He doesn't like Internet Explorer 4, so he refuses to use an operating system based on IE. While IE 4 was a terrible internet browser, it served Windows pretty well; using the idea of back and forward buttons for browsing files/folders is still used today in Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Sure, Windows 98 sucked at it, but that's exactly what Windows XP improved on. (Arguably, Windows Vista improved on this as well.) That's why people upgraded.<p>In the end, by using Windows 95, he is just torturing himself. He might gain pleasure from the novelty of writing stories like this one and getting strange reactions from people, but in the end, his experience of using his computer is just... terrible.",1215279321

It seems kind of obvious to me. In Canada a few years ago one party announced billions of funding for government-run daycare centers, while the other party (who won in the end) wanted to give the money as tax credits to parents. Seemed like a no-brainer to me, but I recall quite a controversy about how the latter proposal was ""anti child care"".<p>Perhaps the discourse is this way partly because of economics. Postwar economic growth was closely linked to women entering the workforce. A mass exodus of parents back into the home could have negative macroeconomic effects (that's the perception at any rate). From a conventional point of view, the ""answer"" is to prevent that from happening and commercialize child care itself.",1215278555

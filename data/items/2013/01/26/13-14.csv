5120334,comment,5120305,5120305,12,0,rodriguezcommaj,,,"The site is Hacker News - not Programmer News. I understand that there is obviously a strong lean towards programming when thinking of hacking, but hacking can apply to broader topics than just programming. A lot of people are interested in eBooks and marketing and if the post helps you think about those things in a new manner and ""hack"" the methods of writing, publishing, and marketing your eBook, then I think it's a valid thing to post. If you check out the guidelines for posts on HN, you will see:<p>""Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.""<p>I think that a lot of these posts will satisfy a ton of people's intellectual curiosity. If it didn't, why would it make it to the front page in the first place?<p>Not to mention that if you extrapolate some of the ideas found in these sorts of posts, you could potentially apply them to things like programming and startups. Seems like a beneficial thing to me to have on the site.<p>I won't go into whether or not some of these posts are that well written or that incisive, but I think a lot of people would agree that they belong here.",1359208794

Maybe you will get some article produced about you generation some attention, but it really doesn't seem helpful. Courageous, I agree, but is it rational? Recently I read about a small protest in mainland China about an instance of media censorship. A bunch of people singed there names on some document complaining about it, and Chinese man who was speaking to some journalists got thrown into a van and taken away. It would not surprise me if some of those people who signed their names will end up getting attacked, so anonymity is beneficial here.",1359208597

Let me tell you what the biggest pile of absolute bullshit is in what you just wrote:<p>>>>Efforts taken at this point to turn things around would be futile<p>That is <i>absolute bullshit.</i>  You don't know what the future looks like nor can you say any new efforts would be futile.  You've just jumped the tracks, are stuck in a rut, and all you're seeing is the damned rut.  I can't help you get out of that rut -- the rut is different for each of us -- but you <i>must</i> find your way out.  Having great days isn't a matter of just waking up to great days.  It's <i>building</i> great days one small step at a time during <i>lousy</i> days.  Think of it like compound interest with money.  Do at least <i>one</i> damn thing to move forward <i>each</i> day.  You don't need a plan -- plans won't help, only create the potential for more disappointment -- you just need to <i>move</i>. <i>Move, move, move</i>  I'll leave it to others here to suggest practical steps.  But standing still in that rut is death and life -- even miserable life -- is <i>better than death.</i>  Death is finality.

5120317,comment,5120020,5120274,6,0,PommeDeTerre,,,"This is more a case of ""old is still old"", I think. We've been hearing about how web apps or browser-based apps will replace desktop apps for many years now, yet it never happens.<p>I can still remember all of the Java applet, ActiveX control and DHTML hype of the late 1990s. It died out when it was proven to be nonsense. Desktop apps continued to thrive.<p>Then it built up again a few years later, during the middle of the last decade, when AJAX and jQuery became all the rage. These offerings were marginally better than what we saw in the DHTML era, but still lacking. The only traction they gained was at the very low end. Most serious users still preferred to use real desktop applications.<p>Now it's a few years later, and there's been a lot of HTML5 hype. Yet the browser-based apps are still no closer to replacing desktop apps. Gmail, for instance, has been around for almost a decade, but a great many people much prefer a real mail client. We also haven't seen much traction when it comes to modern online office suites, and other web-based alternatives to more traditional desktop apps.<p>Native desktop or mobile apps are going to be around for a long time. I question whether it is even possible for any browser-based app to compete. In order to do so effectively, it would be necessary to eliminate the browser itself, as it is the browser and its related technologies which provide the poor experience we get from many web apps. It just looks like a complete no-win situation for web apps, aside from perhaps at the very low end.",1359208053

So rather than buying 2 dolls and 5 generic dresses and swapping pieces between the dolls, they're now selling 6 dolls with 6 dresses, plus more stupid little accessories and such.<p>My hypothesis was that as manufacturing of consumer goods gets cheaper and processes get better, <i>real people</i> are going to stop consuming mass-manufactured goods entirely and start to become more like the dolls.  Instead of my buying clothes at a department store (for instance), and thus wearing much the same stuff as my friends, family and coworkers, it will start to become economical for me to go to a neo-clothier and purchase items specifically measured, designed, cut, manufactured and adjusted for me.  Quality and uniqueness start to become emphasized in consumer goods over mass-production quantities.<p>Basically, ""The Diamond Age"".

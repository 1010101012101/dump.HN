Do they really enjoy the act of dragging a brush over a surface, of cleaning brushes, mixing colours?  These are just the low-level, mechanical parts of the activity.  Playing scales fits in the same category, so does a lot of refactoring.<p>What about the thinking part?",1239627211

The lawyers I know (the ones at the big first) work about 50-60 hrs/week.  Still tough, but nowhere near that bad.  Unfortunately, this is all anecdotal, just what I've observed and what friends have told me.<p>Also, the lawyer is not contracting - it's a job.

559725,comment,559646,559710,0,0,alexdong,,,"hmm, you've raised a good point: ""who is your target audience""?<p>So far, all paid customers are using the API as a web service. Two of them are quite famous iPhone applications provider paying the standard $299/mo fee, three of them are vertical semantic search engines or recommendation engines that paid much more to have the code deployed behind their firewall. Hopefully this could make it easier for you to understand why the website is designed with developers in mind.<p>The reason that I'm making this site more consumer oriented is that I found the current market is a bit too limited. There are many opportunities, for example integrated with Epson's Web2Print software, that I simply don't have the BD resources to attack. I was hoping that by raising more awareness of the service on the consumer side, I could get more publicity which in turn will bring more developer customers.<p>I guess my question is:
1) Do you think my strategy make sense or not?
2) If I were to make this a paid service targeting consumers, what might be the good pricing point? $20 per year? What might be the 'selling point' to normal users?",1239627079

I'm not familiar with Gazelle or WPF, but the rest of these items were not ""invented"" by Microsoft either and can be sourced back to some other point of origin.  So it's not fair to say Microsoft's technology is being copied in these cases because they themselves copied the ideas.<p>The frustrating part is that, similar to General Motors, Microsoft does have good engineering going on but most of the results that come from these efforts never see the light of day in commercial productions.  This is the nature of a large company organized in this way, and why we tend to see innovation in newer, smaller companies that don't know any better.",1239626828

559710,comment,559646,559646,0,0,tdonia,,,"Your approach, Purifyr, seems as though it should be a more consumer friendly alternative to printgreener.  From a story perspective though it's not being presented as a consumer-oriented product which limits the market a prospective reporter/blogger sees when they think of writing a story.  i suggest you start with this:
""Free account could submit requests no shorter than 30 seconds. If you'd like to send requests more frequently, please check out our commercial offering.""<p>if you're intent on not using a passive payment model (advertising) to subsidize consumer traffic, this page is destined to be your main conversion choke point.  this page needs to sell your product.  there should be a big, friendly button that lets the consumer (not developer) immediately make that purchase.  alternately, show an interstitial ad and count down the 30sec before letting them see the content.<p>more fundamentally, you need to decide who your market is and optimize for them.  are you really set on targeting webmasters and if so, how many content producers out there can afford 300/month while accepting a maximum of 10k views/day.  seems like your major competition there is any freelancer who can hack out a ""print view"" wordpress template or even a simple print-view css file for less money.  seems like a consumer model might make more sense, but then i would think about this almost more like an rss reader - if you're targeting consumers, you should consider ways to make it as easy as possible for people to maximize the content they see through your lens.  the bookmarklet is a step in the right direction but isn't something most web users are used to.<p>once you have your market more clearly defined, alert the media that's producing content to entertain said market.  they always need a story but they have discriminating tastes.",1239626128

559703,comment,559224,559337,0,0,sokoloff,,,"So in your proposed solution, you're going to ""push"" the data to memcached, but rely on polling to get the data to the end user, right?<p>If the problem is that your webserver doesn't handle large numbers of open quiescent connections well, then don't use that webserver. Clearly you're capable of writing the application that is pushing the data into memcached. Just have that same (type of) app push the data to the end consumer. Designing a naturally push app to be push-into-cache and then poll seems to be going the long way around.<p>It may also set you up for a terrible scaling ""elbow"" where at some point with increasing load, you'll suddenly be polling for data that was just expired from memcached and you may have little warning that that's about to happen.<p>Apple's worries about battery life and end-user experience are valid and no amount of tears from small developers is going to change them. They have to keep giving the consumer a good experience, which is ultimately what you/we as developers have to do. If that changes the economics slightly, so be it, but Apple is rightly concerned foremost about the buyers of iPhones, not the developers for them.",1239625475

559696,comment,558364,559654,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Don't underestimate the (negative) impact hardware will have on the market for Android applications.<p>This isn't like the desktop computing world, where even a low-end Dell box will run most software people care about; the low end for mobile devices consists of millions of ludicrously-underpowered handsets. Telcos love these because they're incredibly cheap (see: ""sign up for a family plan and get five phones free!""). But from a developer's perspective, these devices are a terrible platform: even if you write an application that can run on a low-end handset, you probably can't turn a profit from it since the prospective customer is someone who, by definition, is willing to forego useful/interesting features to save a bit of cash.<p>So any successful business around Android applications will probably have to target the higher end of the market. But that end of the market is:<p>1. At a price point -- in terms of handsets and voice/data plans -- where people start to think ""if I'm already paying this much, why not just go ahead and get an iPhone?"", and<p>2. So much smaller in terms of handset and carrier choice that the average person probably won't be swayed by arguments about handset and carrier choice.<p>And that's without getting into the problem of writing applications which can run across even the limited spectrum of higher-end handsets: maybe you've got a touch screen and maybe you don't, maybe you've got on-board wifi and maybe you don't, etc.",1239624943

The best stories are about people, the worst about technologies. For startups the story of how you have struggled through countless insourmountable obstacles and are now making big money is perfect. It is personal, it fits the cliche, and it gives readers something to look up to. Don't focus on your technology (unless you are trying to get an article in a trademag or something similar) normal people just don't care. If you need to talk about technology try to find a story where people are using your product to gain some advantage. Involve emotions if possible, it makes the story better. How Tim re-found his long-lost kindergarten girlfriend in old age and the two of them now happily living together because of Google is a much better story than how good Google's serach algorithm is.<p>- Personal connetctions and relationships. This is what PR people do. Journalists are different, have different taste, and find different things interesting. A story that may seem uninteresting to one might be picked up by another. If you don't know anyone try to read through the newssources where you'd like to be covered and see which journalist writes about stuff that is close to what you do. Then contact him. By phone. Talk to him and ask him what he thinks and whether he would like to do an interview with you. Journalists are nice people, and they make their living talking to people, so don't be afraid of it.<p>- Give them an easy story. Combining one and two above to make an easy story that can more or less be copy-pasted to give a full article. Journalists are lazy. Don't forget to include photos. (Again, it's people that are interesting. If you include product shoots make sure there are some with a proud owner showing off the product)<p>- Don't ever lie.

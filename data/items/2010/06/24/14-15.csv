The well-respected consultancy User Interface Engineering has come up with the magic number of 1 review for every 1,300 purchases.<p>""While only one in 1,300 purchasers of the product writes a review, the number who indicate a review was helpful is even fewer. For the Harry Potter volume, which is Amazon's best selling product ever, it was about 0.0014% or about one in 7,300 purchasers of the product. The most helpful review garnered only 566 votes, even though it was written on the first day the book was released and Amazon has sold more than 2,000,000 copies since.""<p><a href=""http://www.uie.com/articles/magicbehindamazon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uie.com/articles/magicbehindamazon/</a>",1277391497

No, building codes are not just for the owner/builder's benefit.  There are community interests at play when someone is putting in a structure.  Usually there are also lender interests at play; i.e. if the owner/builder defaults on the loan used to build, the bank wants to have something that is dependably going to sell.<p>Sure it can slow down innovation some, but this kind of oversight is definitely needed.  Once that is admitted, it is just a discussion of where exactly to draw the line.  There was a disagreement in those discussions, so a compromise was used.

The audience. If you want your opinion to be heard, posting your review on Amazon is the best way to go - just like selling your stuff on eBay makes sense because that's where the buyers are.<p>2. The high quality of the existing reviews. They set a standard which new reviews then attempt to match. That's the result of years of careful management of community expectations.<p>3. The ""Top 1000 reviewer"" badges. They're relatively subtle as badges go, but offer a powerful incentive for the best Amazon reviewers to keep on reviewing.",1277391433

1458157,comment,1456717,1457853,0,0,ekidd,,,"Adult language acquisition is a really weird problem.<p>tl;dr: Plenty of adults actually _can_ learn foreign languages if they put in the hours, though few have sufficient dedication. But maybe not everyone.<p>First, some background on my own experience: I started learning French a little about 2.5 years ago, past the age of 30. I can read non-fiction books in French, and about half the articles in Le Monde. Right now, I'm only studying French a few minutes a day, to maintain my knowledge while working on my startup. Later on, I'll go back to several hours of study a day. (I'm currently at ~350 hours of cumulative study.)<p>Here are some of things I've noticed about adult language learning:<p>1) You can be an enormously gifted language learner with no skill for accents. Alexander Arguelles, for example, has a extremely high degree of fluency in at least 6 languages, a solid command of another 12, and conversational abilities in many more. But his accents are generally terrible. In contrast, I have a decent ear for accents, and some people are amazingly gifted.<p>2) Learning a foreign language is a beastly amount of work: 250 hours for conversational ability (if you're gifted), 1000 or 2000 for moderate fluency, and several thousand more to get really good. Basically, if you're an adult and you're not fully immersed in the foreign language, it requires the kind of dedication you'd need to run a startup. Most people don't seem to have that kind of dedication.<p>3) It's possible to gain fluency in a foreign language past the age of 65. Google ""Steveï»¿ Kaufmann, polyglot"", for example, who's still going strong. And there's a Japanese guy who picked up Chinese and Korean after 65, and who has started on French around the age of 100.<p>4) There is _some_ kind of declining neural plasticity, at least for some people. It's a truism that virtually every single 5-year-old gains fluency in the language spoken by their peers. But as people get older, a smaller portion of the population succeeds in learning a foreign language. And past 20, there will almost always be small defects that mark you as a (highly fluent) foreigner and not a native.<p>So if you're interested, and willing to pay a steep price in time and effort, you might as well go for it. I'd be happy to write up a post explaining how to make best use of your first 250 hours of study, if people are interested.",1277391163

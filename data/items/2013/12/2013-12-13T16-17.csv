The history of the last 1500 years or so has been a continuous, if not perfect, arc towards better societies. Technology reached the point long ago where it outstripped the ability of the people to contain government in a pure firefight. North Korea&#x27;s government, for example, is managing to maintain total and absolute power using essentially 1950s technology. If it weren&#x27;t for the other countries breathing down their necks, they could do it with WWI technology.<p>The basic problem at the root of most dystopian descriptions of the future is that they assume that government actors are not subject to game-theoretic considerations. If anything, technology makes the kind of governments presented in Brave New World or 1984 even less feasible, because with as destructive technology advances, it takes a much smaller faction of people <i>within</i> the government to topple the whole system.",1386953893

Everyone who is not a video geek would not notice a thing. Heck, even I do not notice anything amiss, except for scenes with a lot of motion. This is on large high-quality screens at the optimal viewing distance.<p>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s not the graininess that eats up the bit budget, it&#x27;s motion, and complex fine patterns. Moderately grainy sources such as average film stock don&#x27;t seem to have a large visual impact. But what does have an impact is either lots of motion in the field, or complex &quot;islamic-art-like&quot; patterns, or especially both together.<p>I&#x27;ve put even 3 h 45 min of film stock on a single-layer DVD, at 1080p24. Again, the vast majority of people could not tell the difference. Low motion scenes were perfect. There was some artifacting on high motion segments, but it&#x27;s not the ugly, blocky, unnatural stuff you see on MPEG2. It was blending into the nearby shapes, more flowing and organic-like.<p>2 hours or less and I can&#x27;t tell the difference from the source material at all (I haven&#x27;t done A/B comparisons). Around 3 hours I can tell - although it&#x27;s pretty minimal. The threshold must be somewhere in between. I would only think of splitting it, or using double-layer DVD, somewhere near 4 hours.<p>I use the latest x264, with MeGUI, and the AVCHD profile as defined in MeGUI, with the Film tuning, and 2-pass encoding in order to hit a pre-defined file size.<p>I remember the days when I was transcoding 480i DV tapes onto SVCD, with mpeg2enc.

Now instead of a constant, learnable latency, you have latency that varies wildly depending on what page you are on.<p>This is the wrong solution, in that it makes things more complicated and results in a generally poor experience even after the change. But that is what Google does all the time in UI, so I guess I have no reason to be surprised by this.<p>The proper solution: Do not make double-tap be a UI action. Done.<p>Or, if you insist on double-tap, make it only be an action that stacks transparently with single-tap. For example, in touch controls for The Witness, single-tap makes you walk toward the target. Double-tap makes you run. So as soon as we read a single tap, we can start doing the action without delay, and if we see the second tap we just kick up your target speed.

Look at the context.  Because <i>I</i> certainly didn&#x27;t come to &quot;<i>the</i>&quot; immediate conclusion that you did.<p>A big component of reading comprehension is understanding context.

6901375,comment,6900407,6901214,1,0,dylandrop,,,"> real people whose mother was killed by cancer, and worry about that gene popping up in their own children<p>Certainly everyone&#x27;s mother was killed by cancer who works on cancer. And no, not everyone who works at a Big Pharma company is terrible, but the problem is more that Big Pharma is concentrated on improving their current prescription systems, rather than finding a cheap one-off cure. If Big Pharma wants to stop acting like a giant faceless evil monster, I will stop treating it as such. But how can you really justify current medical costs without saying that someone, somewhere in that industry is doing something disingenuous?<p>> The politicization of science leads to waste such as the recent Solaris nonsense, where we allocate funding based on politics and posturing rather than where it will have the most utility across the whole nation.<p>The problem is that there isn&#x27;t enough demand to justify the cost, if we&#x27;re doing it in a &quot;if a person is diagnosed, they pay for it&quot; manner that capitalism demands. Cancer research costs many, many billions of dollars due to many factors [1]. Say we&#x27;re talking about leukemia research. 40,000 cases were diagnosed this year [2], but should each of those cases have to pay for the extremely high costs of research? Or, could we distribute it in a way such that each citizen pitches in a much smaller amount to help cancer research? In my opinion, the latter makes more sense, rather than punishing those who get sick.<p>Lastly as for credibility in the research world, there are definitely lots of examples I could look up. And also plenty of examples to look up for your cases that you mentioned as well. I think it would be too hard to count, no? But when you see things like the Tobacco Institute (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_Institute#In_popular_culture\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_Institute#In_popular_cu...</a>) it&#x27;s hard to say that we should research everything privately, because the conflict of interest is just too high.

6901324,comment,6896779,6896779,4,0,bananacurve,,,"Here is a decent analogy I read:<p>>Suppose we have a computer program which makes books. All of the commands which tell your computer program how to write a book are stored as sequences of 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s. Also, all of the letters, punctuation marks, and formatting symbols (line break, indent etc) are stored as specific sequences of 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s.<p>The commands which control the computer program and the actual text of the book are both stored in the same file. Up until now, we thought that these were placed side by side in the file, so you would have a segment saying &quot;at 6am every day, print the following text in 12 pt font, and bind it in a hard red cover&quot;, followed by a text containing segment, and then another command segment saying &quot;when you finish, print a copy of the book 134 positions further along in the file.<p>We thought this was the case because we have known the sequences of 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s that stand for each letter for a long time now. When we looked at a file and attempted to interpret it as If it all stood for letters which made up words&#x27; we would see something like &quot;fffffgfgy6- fsjjjjjj the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.bttt68-%jjjjjjfffffffff&quot;. After a while, we learned that the &#x27;gibberish&#x27; segments were actually full of meaningful statements, but they were in a different language and contained the commands for the program.<p>Now getting to today&#x27;s article, this group has found that inside those sections which code for the actual text of the book, there are some commands that run the program. This is accomplished because there is more than one way to write most of the letters. As an example, you could have one segment of text which says &quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times&quot;, and another segment which says &quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times&quot; and also tells the book program to bind the book in gold leaf. And the only difference between the two is that the first one wrote the &#x27;s&#x27; in &#x27;best&#x27; as 00010110, and the second one wrote it as 00010111.",1386951915

I&#x27;ll address them below.<p>>> Even if mattress retailers are making a fortune on margins, well you guys also have margins too. And a retail price of $299..to..$499-king tells me that your mattresses are very low end.<p>We of course have built-in margins on our products, and we try to keep it as fair as possible while supporting our operational overhead. But to write off our beds as &quot;very low end&quot; is a misinformed assumption. We have internal pricing of well known mattress brands that are considered high end by many and they have the same if not lower costs as ours (due to volume and manufacturing in Mexico/China).<p>>> It is just too thin. Less than half the thickness of a regular mattress.<p>We have a 10-inch model (double the thickness) coming out soon. The price won&#x27;t be too much more than the 5-inch, while offering the same level of comfort. But to be honest, we&#x27;ve never had a return for it being too thin.<p>>> the fact that is made of foam only makes it worse as with that thickness it will unavoidable deform with usage<p>Our foam should last 5-7 years before there is any deformity/compression. We&#x27;ve done thorough cycle tests in a lab to test this.<p>>> Then there is the foam density, that I can&#x27;t see anywhere in the specs. And as you can guess when you import materials the bigger the density the more expensive the foam sheets are.<p>The foam in our bed is roughly about 2 lbs in density. There is some variance as with any foam manufacturing process. Our foams are poured and crafted in California, and 3 different layers provide a blend in density that&#x27;s proved to be comfortable and durable. To give a point of reference, Tempurpedic recently dropped below a 1.8 lb density base foam, and that is considered high end. They used to use 2 lb but they reduced it to increase their margins.",1386951438

Do you really believe that they&#x27;re not interested in finding an actual cure? I believe that you&#x27;re viewing these corporations as giant faceless evil monsters. But these corporations are run by, and certainly have researchers who are, real people whose mother was killed by cancer, and worry about that gene popping up in their own children.<p><i>the capitalist approach leads to biased results, again, because research has no incentive at that point to be honest</i><p>Certainly we&#x27;ve seen an unfortunate amount of dishonest results in recent years. Do you have any evidence that the problem is worse in the private sector? My expectation would be the opposite, because in the private sector you&#x27;ve eventually got to sell something that works, whereas in the public sector you can just keep applying for more grants, leaving behind your previous bogus results.<p>Let me also throw in that publicly-funded research is biased in a different way. Where the funds go is targeted not on any rational basis, but based on where the well-organized constituencies are. So what we see today is that per-victim, the amount spent on AIDS/HIV research is vastly disproportionate compared to other maladies whose sufferers are from more diffuse demographics. That is, comparing funding of AIDS research to, say, colon cancer, we spend FAR more for each AIDS patient than for each colon cancer patient. The politicization of science leads to waste such as the recent Solaris nonsense, where we allocate funding based on politics and posturing rather than where it will have the most utility across the whole nation.",1386951025

They last much much longer as dangrossman commented, are more reliable and also much firmer. And also you can&#x27;t leave aside the weather factor because spring mattresses are way more breathable than foam-only mattresses. We, for example, avoid selling foam-only mattresses to people that live on high humidity areas because there is a high chance they will return it with humidity stains.<p>Normally I would go for a pocket spring mattress ( I think that&#x27;s the term in English for a mattress with individual sealed and padded springs ) with a decent amount of memory foam on the top. That way you get the firmness and breathability from a spring mattress plus the comfort of a nice soft memory foam layer.",1386950980

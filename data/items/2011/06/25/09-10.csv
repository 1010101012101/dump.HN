Hey, they spend their time fighting compilers, not reaching consensus.  Soft skills are largely irrelevant.<p>* Probably work in one of a very few technology hubs around the world.  This is all the more painful when you realize how little interaction you actually need with your team, and you could be doing your job from a shack on a Thai beach.<p>* Never have your job understood by anyone.  Unless your S.O. is also a geek, he/she will have no deep understanding and appreciation of your work, beyond the decent salary.  Random strangers will have no idea what ""software engineer"" or ""researcher"" means.<p>* Spend your life in front of a computer.  If you are in a certain percentage of the population (which you won't know), you may suffer debilitating physical pain from this which curbs or ends your career.<p>* Experience a significant uptick in ageism around your mid-thirties.  Just when you're gaining some wisdom to go along with your sponge-like learning ability, you'll suddenly find yourself devalued for no objective reason.<p>You can go into finance and become a millionaire, or at least hob-nob with a few.  You can become a doctor, lawyer, or (to a lesser extent) a CPA, probably make better money, and get significantly more respect.  You can become a teacher, cop, or join the military and make less, but be labeled 'hero'.  Why would you want to be a professional geek?<p>My advice to young people is to pursue your interest in CS, but major in something else.  Being in a non-CS field with outstanding computer skills makes you very special.  Those same computer skills are merely so-so in tech centers, and you have no additional versatility.",1308995593

People yell at java for being verbose and statically typed, but all this verbosity is what allows an IDE such as Eclipse to exist. Just press ctrl+space and the verbosity turns into clarity and speed for both the programmer and the IDE.<p>I have more than a million lines of codes behind me since I learned how to program, 4 years ago. That's 250 thousand lines of working code per year, and I didn't even code more than half-time in java, and I can't type faster than 40wpm. I'm not advocating quantity vs quality, just saying that quantity becomes a completely irrelevant measure when you use Eclipse & Java, and that's very refreshing; you can keep coding long, dumb, and not performance-critical code while you think about another more important/complex section of your project, participate to a meeting, discuss stuff on the phone - you just set sail and let Eclipse do the hard rowing for you.<p>As for refactoring - delete a class named MyClass with a doStuff() method in a project, create a new interface MyClass with a doStuff() method in another project and another package, add this project as a dependency to the first project, select the first project, press ctrl+shift+O, et voila, every file was fixed, and it simply works within a few seconds even if there are a thousand sources referencing that MyClass. I'm not sure if there's any language/IDE that allows that sort of fast & furious refactor, but do tell!<p>What are other great IDE/language combos?",1308995114

For the mass you state, that would be a change of 1.4 * 10^16 joules of kinetic energy, which is 3.2 megatons TNT equivalent. It would take a nuclear reactor to do it quickly enough. It looks like a 50 megawatt reactor would do the trick in about 10 years. That sounds practical.<p>The tricky part is the propellant for the ion drive.

In software development, that's exactly what we try to do!<p>In contracts, though, there are cases where a company will live with ambiguity because it has done an assessment of (1) the likelihood of a dispute, (2) its leverage vs the other party, and (3) its ability to prevail on the merits in the event of a dispute.<p>A contract is usually, although not always, a compromise between two or more parties with at least some divergent interests.  In reaching a satisfactory compromise, sometimes you need to prioritize the parties' disagreements and move onward.  That's why I mention the concession to ambiguity  because it just happens that way.<p>And guess what?  There's a parallel in software development.  Whether it's shipping dates, lack of resources, skills, whatever, software development is also often a compromise.  We all know that stuff gets swept under the rug because it's an obscure edge case, or it only affects 0.x percent of the userbase, etc., etc.<p>My point and yours aren't mutually exclusive; I just wanted to acknowledge that sometimes reality intervenes and makes great things good enough.",1308994491

(Our existing application for this was old and homegrown and pretty bad.)<p>The issue is that the significant majority of our tasks/projects were very small: Take a briefing with a client, write up notes, attach presentation, possibly include a followup note for sales, done. So project management software that was organized around the principle of a modest number of projects with milestones, actions, sub-tasks, etc. didn't really work for us. (Including the 37signals options.)<p>We eventually settled on trac which worked pretty well for the purpose. And we'd probably have supplemented that with something more like Basecamp if we got into some more complex projects and simply handled them as a separate case.<p>My broader point though is that I found that the ""best"" project management software depended on what you were trying to track.",1308994173

Every question has its own time for an answer, and that time may not necessarily be in the contract. It's important to be pragmatic in a business setting.</i><p>While I can appreciate being pragmatic in a business setting, I find this to be mildly offensive as someone who writes code that, if it isn't unambiguous and isn't explicit, will not do what I want or will crash.  Wanting code to operate properly is pragmatic, otherwise you're just wasting your time.  Why is leaving contracts ambiguous and open to interpretation pragmatic?<p>Now, I can see that it's not very pragmatic to quibble over wording/structure in a contract up front, that can just end up wasting time.  This is tantamount to purposely writing pseudo-code into your .c file and expecting gcc to do something useful with it -- but programmers don't do that, (the good ones, perhaps those 10x more productive ones) try to write code the first time that the compiler will accept.  It seems like it would be even more pragmatic, from a business standpoint, to be more precise in the wording and structure <i>on the first pass</i> and avoid (even the small) risk of there being debate over the interpretation later on.  The only reason ""being pragmatic"" comes up is because it seems to be the norm to gloss over a bunch of stuff and purposely make it ambiguous (considering your 4 examples) rather than being, ahem, explicitly explicit.",1308993401

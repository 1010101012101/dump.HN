113875,comment,113292,113708,0,0,ntoshev,,,"Perhaps this is a case where Google uses its position in advertising to achieve domination in other markets. Domain sales just can't be enough, and funding is not a long-term way maintain business.<p>I do think they are a nice acquisition target for Yahoo or Microsoft, though - both having their own ad networks and no similar offering, it makes a lot of sense for them to buy Weebly and integrate it with their advertising platforms.",1202802061

113871,comment,113473,113771,0,0,jbert,,,"My hunch is that it's down to cache invalidation logic. It's easier for the app to know when a single memcached entry needs to be invalidated than for the SQL engine, which perhaps tends to be conservative in what it can cache.<p>(e.g. MySQL query cache is flushed if a single write happens to the table, so <i>all</i> your users will be dumped out of that cache whenever any row is updated.)<p>Hence you get a better hit-rate with memcached. Perhaps it is also simply easier to tune memcached than most db memory caches.<p>I benched ""retrieve data and instantiate object"" on a couple of different, unloaded, systems and a simple select-and-instantiate-from-mysql was a bit faster than the memcached equivalent. I didn't measure CPU usage server-side though, so under load things might be different.",1202801661

I was thinking about similar ideas, but didn't come up with two of your clever solutions: aggregation of micropayments to increase efficiency, and giftcards to avoid regulation. But I didn't want to give up on it, because I thought it would be good for the world. I'm glad to see you guys have already built it, and I'm very impressed with the execution!<p>I might make a suggestion though. While Amazon is great, I'd like to think, or home, at a few people getting tips would be basically able to live off them for a time, and that means they'd need to either get cash, or be able to use tips to pay for living expenses. It might be troublesome to get a deal, but I'd love to see grocery stores as a source of giftcards.<p>Many thanks, and a hearty congratulations, Kirigins!",1202801140

I've been working in a lab doing research for the last year and a half, and it sucks. As an earlier comment had pointed out, the post-doc I work along side only makes $40,000/year. He's in his 50's and has at least 30 published papers on everything from cancer research to stuff the lab is doing now on BK virus. For the last year, he's been trying to find a different job, preferably in the private sector and that pays more, but hasn't had any luck. The work is repetitive and boring, yet you must constantly stay focused. While it may not seem like it, it's very easy to lose track of which tube you're adding a chemical to, or which chemicals you've already added.<p>The bureaucracy is ridiculous. My PI doesn't do any of the research along with us. He just sits and writes/revises papers and applies to grants all day. Most of the time, he has no idea how the experiments we're doing even work.<p>From my research experience and from the experience of others around me, I knew research was not the field to go into. That's why I'm working on a startup now and possibly going into an MBA program. Science is a great undergraduate major, just don't expect to be able to do anything with it when you graduate.<p>If you want to do research, at least in biology, don't get a PhD, get an MD.",1203824884

This article describes how you can be financially independent much more cheaply by living overseas.<p>Say you saved up $100,000.  If you then stick it all in a high interest savings account:

you can withdraw about $325 a month from interest alone, which is more than enough to live in some overseas countries.<p>So, if you are interested in retiring early, and don't have expensive tastes, this is a route to consider.  Here's someone who did it, and lives on $319 a month:

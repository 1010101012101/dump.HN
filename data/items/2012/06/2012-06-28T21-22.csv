But this technique is mostly applicable to low-interactivity views (see the view layer overview chapter) - once you start displaying the same data in multiple locations, having your data tied to the DOM structure and state goes from being a easy technique to a complication. Hence I don't really consider storing data in the DOM as a single page app technique as much as an easy way to do low-end interactive components.",1340920764

If your tests fail in just one browser, well, you get the picture.<p>Funny how older versions of browsers such as Opera are never mentioned. IE versions 6-8 seem to be the only ""old"" browsers that exist. Which of course is because they're still in use. Myopia reigns supreme.<p>I've often found that IE versions 4-9 will point out errors I've made in my code, as the IE platform is far more strict than browsers such as Firefox, which scramble to protect bad code.<p>> Accordingly, automating testing in Internet Explorer is much more involved than any other browser.<p>As someone that tests in 20+ browsers, I spend a lot more time on Firefox versions 1-13 than I do with IE versions 4-9, especially with scripting. Nevermind Google Chrome, which makes testing incremental versions nearly impossible (and no, auto-upgrades are no guarantee).<p>> Getting automatic cross-browser JavaScript testing working is a complex affair, and bound to involve some amount of trial and error.<p>Conclusion: test manually.

I'm not 100% sure why people prefer Android or iOS to BBX, but I think it's partly just psychological. Whatever the reason is, I think Samsung and Apple are pretty happy with RIM and Nokia using a different (even if arguably superior) OS which don't sell very well.<p>RIM has over 1B cash, has about 16,500 (soon 11,500) employees. Most of their loss was from writedowns, so their burn rate might not be too bad. They might have time to switch to Android. They can't afford BB10 to flop, but I'm pretty sure it will (even if it's actually a great OS).<p>If they can loose some heads, and switch to Android, they might generate some confidence which could help them get funding.

Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded 460 startups with only a handful of big wins. The rest have faded away, been acquired quickly without growing out of a feature company, or continue to hang on as zombie companies, which are not dying, but not really doing anything either. Who knows how many of these companies could grow into something bigger without the pressure of generating a return for early investors in just a few short years.</i><p>This is always going to be true of every incubator. No startup program can promise to vault a majority of its participants to Heroku or even Reddit levels of success. Similarly, the top tier of VCs famously get the best companies; what's the win rate at Sequoia?

4174157,comment,4166540,4169979,1,0,erso,,,"> Git absolutely cares about files.<p>In a sense. A commit is not a set of files, it is one or more blobs and one or more trees (which may in turn point to one or more blobs or trees.) A blob does refer to a file, both in content and location, but it's the blob that matters. The OP speaks of the files on disk, which Git doesn't copy around. Git does, however, change the state of the working directory to that which matches the trees referenced in the commit. What I don't like about this is that it tries to make it seem like the files on disk matter in a way that they don't from Git's perspective.<p>> I don't understand your objection to this phrasing.<p>I had a chat with a coworker and he agreed that my distaste with the ""current branch"" terminology is perhaps misplaced.<p>> When used as ""git checkout <ref>"", this is correct, but that is not what the author is talking about. ""git checkout <ref> <file>"" or ""git checkout -- <file>"" does exactly what the author describes, copying files from the given commit or index to the working directory.<p>Of course, the files that are being copied are not the files that the OP is talking about. The files being copied are the trees and blobs, not the files in the working directory. The effective result is the same, but thinking in files on disk will not improve one's knowledge of Git.<p>> Only partly true, but true enough. The commit isn't irretrievably lost, but the reflog falls more under ""advanced usage""; certainly a git beginner shouldn't be making detached commits and relying on the reflog to get back to them.<p>Shunning the reflog doesn't do anyone any good. The OP not even mentioning the reflog is in poor taste, and makes the statement in the guide untrue.<p>I did a bit of research into the reflog after some questions arose and should update my prior comment about it to say: Any commit that Git determines to be unreachable (a list of which that you can see with `git fsck --unreachable`) will only be removed from the reflog after both the reflog's unreachable expiration time has passed (by default, 30 days for unreachable) and `git gc` has ran. At the very least, without mentioning the reflog, the OP should state that unreachable commits will remain for 30 days.",1340920291

The reason I insist on that is because the value of their theorems lies in the fact that they have been mathematically proven, and the proof only holds in very particular conditions. Basically, a system that is strong enough to prove statements about arithmetic cannot prove its own consistency. This hypothesis about the difficulty of certain machine learning tasks is a conjecture, at best. I don't think you could prove it, and if you could, it would look very different from the incompleteness proof. I think it has to do with certain AI problems being hard, but this is a rather vague notion; perhaps we simply lack certain concepts or mathematical tools.

These ""Google Now Cards"" hardly share any connotations I have with the word ""card"", except for being rectangular and containing a small amount of information.<p>To the other person calling them ""atomic"" bits of information, neither the information on ""Google Now Cards"", business cards, or index cards is ""atomic"". You can easily split the information and the bits still make sense. You probably meant to say ""chunk"" or ""unit"" or perhaps ""self-contained""--though external links make them not very self-contained either.<p>I kind of get the idea they picked the word ""card"" because it's such a mundane, every-day word. And they want their product to appear like that. It's just a card! Must be easy to use!<p>Calling it a ""message"" or ""notification"" would also make it sound intrusive, like it interrupts your activity whenever it activates. A ""card"" has a very <i>passive</i> connotation, and that's the idea they want to give: It doesn't interrupt you, only when you look at your phone, it's right there presenting you with the info you need right now.<p>The problem I think is, we don't really have a every-day metaphor for such a thing. Maybe a ""personal assistent"", but I don't think they wanted to use a metaphor of something that is ""alive"", because it brings connotations of inaccuracy and doing all sorts of stuff with it, while they want just this thing that, when you look at it always happens to show exactly what you want to see.<p>They should've called it ""psychic paper"" :-) (<i>Dr. Who</i>)<p>Personally I feel a bit of annoyance at calling it ""card"" because <i>if</i> this thing really takes off they've claimed a mundane every-day use word with a rather inaccurate extra meaning.

They're obviously not taking it lightly.<p>You're comparing apples to oranges. Different OSes and devices have completely different requirements. iOS have no true multi-tasking like Android does. So Android naturally is more CPU intensive since you'll usually have more stuff happening in the background. The new iPad has a larger resolution. So it's understandable it needs a powerful GPU for smooth graphics.<p>You can't just compare the bang for the buck you get from CPU vs GPU looking at different OSes. The optimal point will be different for each. I'm sure google tried different setups that would fit the $200 budget. At the end of the day. All the matters is whether it can display smooth UX with a long battery life and good price. And it seems they got there.",1340917327

4173913,comment,4171797,4173382,8,0,tptacek,,,"Thanks for asking this question. To help understand what's being alleged by the DOJ, you'd probably want to know what they found in Mega's email; for instance:<p><i>On or about April 23, 2009, DOTCOM sent an e-mail message to VANDER KOLK, ORTMANN, and BENCKO in which he complained about the deletion of URL links in response to infringement notices from the copyright holders. In the message, DOTCOMstated that I told you many times not to delete links that are reported in batches of thousands from insignificant sources. I would say that those infringement reports from MEXICO of 14,000 links would fall into that category. And the fact that we lost significant revenue because of it justifies my reaction.</i><p>* ""We have a funny business... modern days pirates"", said one Mega- employee to another. ""We're not pirates"", he responded. ""We're just providing shipping services to pirates.""<p>* When an outsider complained that MegaVideo's hosting of the Showtime pay-tv series ""Dexter"" had desynchronized audio/video, instead of taking down ""Dexter"", Kim Schmitz fired off mail saying that fixing the AV problem was a priority.<p>* Mega employees themselves uploaded copies of major motion pictures to the service, such as Luc Besson's _Taken_.<p>* There are Mega emails, on which Kim is apparently CC'd, in which employees enumerate the specific files uploaded to certain high-performing affiliate members, noting (approvingly) that they include copyrighted movies and TV shows. For instance, one line item in an accounting mail: <i>100 USD [USERNAME DELETED] 10+ Full popular DVD rips (split files), a few small porn movies, some software with keygenerators (warez)</i><p>Remember: there are two sides to claiming ""safe harbor"": complying with takedowns, and not operating your service with <i>actual knowledge</i> of infringing activity on the service. Mega obviously operated with extensive actual knowledge of infringement. The operators of Youtube obviously knew that piracy was rampant on the Internet, and even on their service, but no prosecutor or litigator was ever able to show that Youtube's operators knew of specific, actual infringing activity on the site.<p>I found it easier to cite my comments from the last big Mega thread here than to go back to the indictment, which you can find easily on Google. The indictment is <i>hilarious</i>. The craziness at Mega just goes on and on. If you can think of something a lawyer would tell you <i>not</i> to do if you were going to run a file sharing service, Mega probably found a creatively terrible way to do it.",1340917305

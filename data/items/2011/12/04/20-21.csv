Re: asians-<p>I went to a magnet high-school in the late 1990's, and at the time it was about 25% asian. My brother went there later, and by the time he finished (10 years after I had started) the demographics had skewed to 50%+ asian and the culture had changed dramatically. People were a lot less fun and a lot less outgoing, and a lot more intense and competitive.<p>When I went to law school I met a lot of fun, outgoing asians, so I don't want to paint things with too broad a brush, but honestly I wouldn't want my kid going to a school that was 50%+ asian. College is a time when kids should be getting socialized. Drinking, figuring out the opposite sex, even a little bit of risk taking are valuable in teaching people to navigate modern American society, and when you're surrounded by people whose parents spent 18 years telling them not to do any of those things I think you have an impoverished experience. Actually, when my brother was choosing between HYP and Caltech, I helped him lobby my parents for the former for precisely these reasons.",1323032368

Just jump on Google Taxi (I use Google as they're the only company that has working driverless cars that I'm aware of at the moment), log-in using your account (that you either pay per ride, weekly, monthly, yearly, yearly+ etc.), calculate your commute, and reserve a car to show up at your house at that time and place. It takes you to your destination then shoots off to an electric or hydrogen-based fleet of these cars standing by at charging facilities in neighborhoods and cities all over the world. If they became ubiquitous enough you could have as little as a five to fifteen minute wait for a car.<p>However, I think the auto industry would fight like hell to keep this kind of system off the roads as it would severely dent auto sales. I mean hell, I know I wouldn't want a car if I could just have a subscription to a car. Especially if it wasn't just like Sedans. Imagine being able to rent a truck immediately at a moment's notice, then ride back home in a Sedan, all without having to worry about driving anywhere?<p>That's a world I would like to live in.

Perhaps you should explore why the walls happen.<p>On finding something to build, it can be tough.  You have to keep thinking about things that scratch an itch of yours but are also practical to build.  For the longest time, I used to think and even plan out ideas that really seemed to be like science fair projects:  2D drawing using contour maps to design 3D structures like for game design, an app to tell me how to fit a bunch of boxes optimally into a truck/van, a form creator (an ultimate GUI over DB to replace many GUI-over-DB apps).  The problem is that I wouldn't use any of these for my own needs because I don't need these things.  And I didn't know anyone who actually needed this stuff and could use it if I built it.  Find something that scratches an itch.  Do you need something but all the existing tools aren't quite right?  Go for it.  And don't worry about using ""cool"" tech to get it done.  If Clojure can be used to solve the problem and you really want to learn it, great.  If not, then stick to what you know but focus on getting the problem solved and building something of value to you.<p>Perhaps a new job might give you a fresh environment, a change of pace, or something different to learn during work.  That could be used to stimulate more or different learning on the side.<p>As far as feeling depressed when you see hackers who have done a ton of stuff, I imagine everyone looks at someone who has done more than them and wonders the same.

Ignore financial services-based engineering positions, although there are a lot less of those today.<p>Current equivalent in SF right now could be $75-$90k for a mid-level developer and $100-$150k for a senior developer (or more).<p>Keep in mind London is a more expensive city to live in than even SF, taxes are higher (yes even compared to CA+Fed), health insurance isn't included (ok, we have socialized medicine but my point is that's part of your comp here in US), sales tax in UK is 20%, and unlike the US you have to pay property tax (council tax) on the property you live in regardless of whether you rent or own it.<p>Living in the UK, especially London, is incredibly expensive and I sometimes wonder how I managed frankly :P<p>EDIT: Oh and the reason I think wages and rates are low is because software engineering isn't a primary industry in London and a great deal of developers end up working for marketing agencies etc where they are simply ""code monkeys"". The BBC is another big employer <i>(my former employer)</i> but they only pay non-commercial wages as they are a public-service and it (used to be) seen as prestigious to work there.",1323031268

3311724,comment,3310635,3310635,1,0,AmericanOP,,,"The airplay rollout has not been executed well.<p>Overall, it is successful of course. It's a killer feature and highly popular among consumers.<p>I believe it has been mismanaged for the following reasons.<p>First, rollout has been incredibly slow and there is still a major dearth of airplay enabled devices. This is not due to limitations of technology. Airplay comes from a company called BridgeCo, not Apple. BridgeCo did not do a good job of building OEM relations and following through to see Airplay implementations. This is not BidgeCo's fault, entirely. The BridgeCo team was a small (>6) executive staff in the states with an engineering team in India. While I do not know the full extent of Apple's imposed limitations, I know they were a factor. Still, BridgeCo had an opportunity to build a robust ecosystem- instead they were focused on selling SDK's for >$20k and not the front end UX. I do not think they were a Silicon Valley company culturally.<p>Apple has not taken a lead on pushing the technology as a standard at all. For the first year after Airplay's rollout, the only A/V receivers with airplay capabilities were super high-end Denons with a pricepoint near $1k. Not consumer. For the record, I haven't checked recently, this could still be the case. The market for 3rd party all-in-one speakers, the obvious destination for airplay technology, also developed very slowly.<p>Fortunately, apple sells a $99 airplay antenna called the Apple TV which can plug into just about any home theater system. Within the last few months though, Apple has been pushing updates to ATV's which has <i>completely destroyed the airpay experience</i> by locking down the format. I can no longer play downloaded video media on my non-jailbroken apple tv. Apple wants me to purchase streaming media from the Apple TV market- I don't care. I want to play the downloaded media on my laptop on my HDTV. Crazy, I know. Apple says no.<p>And this, of course, is the biggest fail of the Airplay rollout. Airplay is not just audio- it's video. This feature has zero presence on 3rd party devices- possibly positioning for an Apple HDTV launch. Still, BridgeCo (now SMSC) should have pushed the tech on HDTV OEMs.<p>While interesting, and slightly sad, none of this matters since ultimately airplay is the standard and I will continue to watch its development and buy airplay devices since there are no alternatives due to there being no other company developing next-gen core computing user experiences.",1323031103

The US's ACLU seldom condemns the reprehensible acts of some of its clients, for instance. Rather they limit themselves to furthering the rule of law in general. But the BSD communities tend to be small and take on both roles, for if they didn't there would be nobody else to do it. I do not think major players in major BSD licensed projects are confusing these issues, but onlookers and others often times do.<p>The position seems clear: 1) You <i>can</i> use BSD licensed software as per the generous license, and 2) FOSS developers <i>should</i> facilitate sharing code, including sharing reciprocally with other FOSS developers. No violation of item 2 will interfere with item 1.<p>By far the largest part of the past kerfuffle between OpenBSD and Linux developers had to do with violating the BSD license.

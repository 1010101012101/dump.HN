I actually have a better version that's much more accurate and fast:<p>1. It eliminates a lot of false positives (such as detecting that the white sky has been copied when it's simply white)<p>2. It automates manual tweaking of the parameters.<p>3. It's multithreaded.<p>I guess I should be cold calling Reuters etc. to see who wants to license the fast version.",1215763148
243349,comment,243046,243334,0,0,ars,,,"As I replied to someone else, you are right, I was off by 10 in my calculations (a typo in my calculator, sigh). But I did take efficiency, and light weight vehicle into account.<p>But I still maintain that the heating/cooling losses from compressing the air are going to hurt efficiency a lot. It's really hard to do anything with waste heat, especially since this car probably won't be sold in cold climates, so the waste heat can't be used for heating.<p>But, since an air engine is so much more efficient than internal combustion, it might work out.<p>But if it works so well, I wonder why no one did it before now - is the tank the problem?<p>Does it make sense to use a larger, lower pressure tank?<p>I'm very interested in these ideas, and I spend a lot of time dreaming up ideas - basically every time I have to fix something in my car I think of a way to design a car without that part. But I don't know if I could actually help you - I'm a computer programmer, I don't have experience with any of the skills you mentioned.",1215762987

243341,comment,243046,243284,0,0,ars,,,"Ah! That makes a lot more sense.<p>The only trouble with using a gas like co2 that liquefies easily is that once you reach that point (850psi) you pretty much can't go any farther. And they are running this thing at a much higher pressure than that - about 4500.<p>I'm sure there are gases that would liquefy at this pressure, but none that you would want to release into the atmosphere.",1215761876

243339,comment,243046,243159,0,0,MaysonL,,,"In the winter you compress the air at home and use the heat to keep your house nice and toasty.<p>Your calculations are off: energy density of gasoline ~35 MJ/L, compressed air at 300 bar ~ .15, so per volume is ~230 times, so w 10x efficiency, it's down to 23X volume required: tank to be used is 340 L : divide by 23 ~= 15 L ~= 4 gal. Much closer to their claim, no?<p>The compression stations will have heat exchangers, so be able to use at least some of the wasted energy...<p>(Note: energy density figures from Wikipedia)",1215761218

But you're also misleading by saying that these are merely some 130K out of millions of titles.<p>Those are 130K of the highest-selling books by volume on Amazon - I wouldn't be surprised if they accounted for 30-50% of sales, even though they're a much smaller fraction  of the millions of titles<p>So it's not 12% of Amazon sales, but still a significant fraction of that.",1215760542

243334,comment,243046,243159,0,0,DaniFong,,,"You've made a few small mistakes, but they're non-obvious.<p>One big thing is that your current vehicle doesn't push the technical mileage limits as far as the Air Car does.<p>You've assumed the car is the same weight. Cars can be made much lighter than those currently on the market today. You can get well below 1000 pounds. For example, one design prototype is the Volkswagen 1-liter car, which gets 282 mpg. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_1-litre_car"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_1-litre_car</a>). This design uses a variety of techniques to get the mileage up, and does so quite wonderfully.<p>With an Air Car it's even easier: you can even do it in a production, mass market system. You need not have a transmission, or an electrical system, or an air conditioning system, so you can get a very good car, a production car, for under 1000 pounds.<p>Also, unlike gasoline engines, it's a comparatively simple matter to have breaks which recover power. Power recovering breaks become simply a system for compressing and releasing a piston: a fairly mature technology actually. So breaking is not as much of an issue, and the energy you'd lose for it can be recovered at about the 70% efficiency level.<p>Also, compressed air, at 300 bar (4500 psi) stores approximately 16 kwh per 300 liters, (via wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_vehicle#Storage_Tanks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_vehicle#Storage_Tanks</a>), giving an energy density of 0.0056 of gas (in liters). In other words, gasoline takes 176 times less space, not 3000 times, as you guessed. And given modern tanks, the air is lighter than it is large (compared to gas), though weight is a property of the tank, and does not scale linearly. I haven't factored the efficiency of gas versus air engines into this calculation, as both technologies are varied and evolving.<p>When these factors combine, you can get a much, much more efficient vehicle than ordinary. Getting around 80 km is a no-brainer, and 300 km is well within the realm of possibility. You might go up to 1000km before you start to hit fundamental limits.<p>To address some of your other concerns.<p>The temperature regulation of the compressed air tank is not as much of an issue as you think. There are two temperature regulation problems. The first is heating the tank as you compress it. This is not a fundamental problem, but it's actually a technical detail that I think I've solved, and I want to develop it for my startup. You'll just have to trust me that there's a way to heat this cost effectively. The second direction is when the air is expanding. While the expanding air leaving the tank is quite cold, the tank itself doesn't expand very fast, and air simply doesn't have much heat capacity. Oil and water have a far greater heat capacity, and so running a radiator in a gasoline car is actually a much more significant problem.<p>Also, the oil they use is actually a vegetable oil derivative. They use a combination anti-oxidant and mineral (anti-corrosion) additive (such as <a href=""http://www.hexion.com/products/technicaldatasheet.aspx?id=3986"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hexion.com/products/technicaldatasheet.aspx?id=39...</a> though I don't know the exact product).<p>Additionally, there are wonderful, wonderful ways in which to improve the energy economy of these vehicles as compared to gasoline (or any other comparable vehicle, including electric). Email me, if you might be interested, since I am working on them, and actually looking for more mechanical engineering and organizational talent, or funding, or mentorship.",1215760442
243333,comment,243327,243327,0,0,cmos,,,"Wow.  Read this.  Completely.  This is exactly the kind of news I hope to pick up in this group... (the dot dot dot is indeed a reference to the watered down crap that has been posted here recently)<p>How refreshing is to to get a perspective from a former CEO of an enormous corporation.  He writes for a large audience, beyond the easy geeks and enthusiasts.<p>He brought 'global warming', an issue that not everyone agrees with, out of the picture, and more into the 'free benfit' category, a necessary move for a national (i.e. midwestern) debate.  He challenged the current and previous leaders of our free world as to why they have not even come close to upholding the degree of nixon.  Brilliant.<p>We have a problem people should want to solve.  This is a good step in letting people know exactly what will help their kids to be truly free.<p>(I'm sorry for saying the word 'crap' up above but seriously, only 1/4 of the posts here have to do with innovation, hacking, and making something from nothing.

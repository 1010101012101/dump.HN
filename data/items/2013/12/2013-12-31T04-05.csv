For that matter, it is probably not that difficult to insert known vulnerable code into some widely used application without it being detected.  While there will always need to be some trusted code, it is possible to limit the amount of trusted code and the number of sources that code comes from given better OS security models.<p>Since hardware and firmware can also be subverted, IMO a new security model should also be able to track and limit what network traffic is intended so that the network traffic actually generated can be (potentially) verified by additional machines on the network and/or by other verifier virtual machines on the same system.",1388465763

But, the specific components of your encomium do not recommend you.  More specifically:<p>> That he started the seed funding movement?<p>Um, people were doing seed rounds before YC.  For like, decades.  They weren&#x27;t blogging about it, because there was no HTTP and HTML and always-on broadband, but crikey, how the hell do you think half of silicon valley <i>started</i>?<p>> That he was blogging about hacking startups before people even really realised you could hack startups?<p>I don&#x27;t even know what this means.  Every true startup is fundamentally a hack; it&#x27;s probing at the boundary of the risk frontier.  (I&#x27;m not talking about those VC dice rolls on the flavor du jour, manifest as a bunch of brogrammers with zero understanding of the time value of their own risk profile.)<p>For &quot;hack startups <v.>&quot; to make sense, one would have to infer a new usage of the word &quot;startups&quot;, namely, to refer to the pattern-matching herd mentality of tech VC dealmaking and The Great Game of Deal Flow.  Partially driven by real opportunity and partially driven by the wealthy exodus from equity markets in a post-HFT world, the modern funding bubble has led to a difficult climate for seed-stage companies, and Paul & YC are merely taking advantage of that impedance mismatch between them and traditional VCs.  But to imply that there is some fundamental new structure that Paul discovered with YC is absurd.  Incubators & incubation is a decades-old concept: <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_incubato"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_incubator</a><p>> Before lean startup existed?<p>The term &quot;lean startup&quot; started being popularized in 2011 by Eric Ries.  This is less than three years ago.  There are innumerable things older than this.  Actually, there are few truly noteworthy things in the technology space that <i>cannot</i> be described as existing &quot;before lean startup&quot;.<p>> That he&#x27;s written his own dialect of LISP?<p>I think many LISPers have done this.  Isn&#x27;t the whole point of LISP to write your own dialect of it for each problem?<p>Anyways, I just wanted to point out that your list is not very impressive at all, and the fact that they impress you doesn&#x27;t really reflect well on you.",1388465408

Quotes, unfortunately, aren&#x27;t always provided in easily-digestible form. This is particularly the case in informal, spoken-word interviews -- which seems to be the situation here.<p>Most people, when faced with questions they don&#x27;t know in advance, speak in very ungrammatical, broken sentences. They interrupt themselves, they use the wrong words because they don&#x27;t have the time to pick better ones, and (as pg said) they sometimes stop talking when the interviewer understands what they&#x27;re trying to say.<p>If you&#x27;re listening to these interviews, they make sense because it&#x27;s slower, and you can usually intuit their mood, watch their body language, and figure out the point they&#x27;re driving at. Transcribed without edits, it&#x27;ll probably need a few re-reads, and you&#x27;ll question their ability to communicate. I&#x27;d bet a lot of spoken interviews would fail the Turing test.<p>For an example of this, listen to a few random interviews with people who aren&#x27;t in the business of public speaking on a news network, or tune in to a game and listen to the sportscasters. Imagine you were reading it exactly as spoken, and imagine how difficult it would be to make sense of it.<p>Thus: editing. It&#x27;s entirely reasonable for a journalist to make small transcription edits for clarity. Readers get confused or irritated or bored if they need to struggle to make sense of the interview.  It&#x27;s entirely ethical <i>if</i> the edits don&#x27;t change the meaning of the quote. That&#x27;s what happened here -- but do we know it was necessary unethical? (As opposed to being negligent?) Well, as with the quote itself, we need to look to the context.<p>It&#x27;s uncertain to what degree the nature of the interview was made clear to pg. He says it was clearly communicated as one thing, and Jessica Lessin says it was clearly communicated as another. We can&#x27;t really know without seeing the actual communication between them.<p>If we assume that Lessin&#x27;s account is accurate, and the discussion was intended to be used as an interview, then it&#x27;s reasonable to assume those pieces would be polished up and pushed out at some point. It&#x27;s also reasonable to assume the removal of &quot;these&quot; was an honest mistake, for the reason <i>The Information</i> gave; it referred to a group that pg didn&#x27;t explicitly mention. It&#x27;s also reasonable to think that the person making the edits thought it would be obvious pg was referring to female startup founders, since the question to which he was responding <i>does</i> explicitly mention it.<p>With this assumption, and since it was a different publication that raised the controversy, I can very easily see it as an honest mistake -- in other words, negligence. Lessin and <i>The Information</i> owe pg an apology for that.<p>Now, it&#x27;s within the realm of possibility that the quote was altered intentionally, which would be highly unethical. But again, if they wanted to do that, they probably would have pointed it out themselves, rather than waiting for ValleyWag to do it.",1388464341

YC can&#x27;t fix this, but there may be things that can and should be done to improve how it handles that existing bias.",1388464181

Sounds like the list is constrained to failures that really do mean a bug in the code such that <i>something is seriously wrong, let&#x27;s get the heck out of here</i> is probably the only appropriate response if you&#x27;re trying to build a robust system.<p>Take the null reference example: A NullReferenceException means that a value&#x27;s null in a spot where the programmer either didn&#x27;t believe or didn&#x27;t consider that null would be a possible value at that point in the program.  So when it happens, there are two things you can be sure of:  First, things have strayed off into the weeds.  Second, there&#x27;s nobody around to check everything out and make sure we can get steered safely back on track, because the developer&#x27;s been out of the picture since the start of compile time.  These two facts imply that letting execution continue would be A Roll of the Dice, and therefore Not a Good Idea.<p>If having the module crash in this situation isn&#x27;t acceptable, no worries. There are still ways around it short of splitting the component in two.  One much easier option would be:<p><pre><code>  if (x == null) { /* handle null case */ }</code></pre>",1388464103

Try to first write the test and then make it pass (also know as fixing the bug), so you know that the test will spot a regression on future runs.<p>If you are working on a new feature, try to isolate the core logic of the feature and test that. If you can, test it in isolation from the rest of the system and integrate it after you have achieved some semblance of correctness.<p>If your code base has parts that you only touch rarely and you know (or hope) are reasonably solid, leave them for later. The highest risk for breakage tends to be near the spots with the most code churn, so put your tests there.<p>Also remember that tests are code and they must be maintained as you would maintain the rest of your code. Writing tests for implementation details that have no real impact on program correctness won&#x27;t yield you much value when weighted against the cost of their maintenance.<p>If you are after the most &quot;value per test&quot; think about it this way: The most valuable test you can write today is the one that will catch breakage tomorrow.

6988894,comment,6988266,6988266,3,0,abalone,,,"This whole thing is a fascinating demonstration of the power of contextualization to color one&#x27;s perception of the facts.<p>When you read the whole transcript, it&#x27;s pretty clear pg is NOT just talking about a subset of women. He means women <i>as a whole</i> are underrepresented in the founder population because it&#x27;s really hard to get 13 year old girls interested in coding.<p>When the valleywag expose was first published, I thought the comments were pretty damning. pg&#x27;s reponse really focused my attention on the omission of &quot;these&quot; and persuaded me that he was only talking about women &quot;who aren&#x27;t programmers.&quot; This convinced me that The Information are egregious hacks. After all, they omitted a word without an ellipsis and that&#x27;s clearly wrong.<p>But now, perhaps motivated by my fascination, I took the time to actually read the full transcript. And it&#x27;s clear pg is talking about <i>all female applicants to YC.</i><p>Here&#x27;s a fuller excerpt that traces the complete context of exactly what group of people pg is referring to.<p>--------<p>Eric: I want to circle back to women in YC. How much do you think YC needs to be proactive, has any moral obligation to be proactive about this, or anything like that?<p>pg (excerpts):<p>There’s a couple of reasons why there are not as many female founders...<p>If the reason we accept few female founders is that we’re biased against them, we would be able to tell this... I’m almost certain that we don’t discriminate against female founders...<p>The problem with that is... the people who are really good technology founders have a genuine deep interest in technology...<p>If someone was going to be really good at programming they would have found it own their own. Then if you go look at the bios of successful founders this is invariably the case, they were all hacking on computers at age 13...<p>God knows what you would do to get 13 year old girls interested in computers...<p>You can tell what the pool of potential startup founders looks like... You can go on Google and search for audience photos of PyCon... That’s a self selected group of people. Anybody who wants to apply can go to that thing. They’re not discriminating for or against anyone.<p>[at this point Eric asks his question about how Y Combinator could be more proactive]<p>Paul: We can’t make these women look at the world through hacker eyes and start Facebook because they haven’t been hacking for the past 10 years.<p>--------<p>Conclusion: The entire time pg is referring &quot;female founders&quot; and the &quot;pool of potential startup founders&quot;. His only reference to &quot;programmers&quot; is merely in describing the pool of potential startup founders. And women aren&#x27;t in it because they weren&#x27;t &quot;hacking on computers at age 13&quot;.<p>So yes, absolutely pg made a gaffe in saying girls aren&#x27;t hackers. That is in fact what he said, and is now pretending he didn&#x27;t, and that it would be &quot;absurd&quot; for him to say it. But he did.",1388462885

Personally I think backwards compatibility is getting less attention than it deserves, and that software should evolve slowly and gradually and not suddenly make huge leaps, because all these breaking changes start to look like they&#x27;re just creating unnecessary, wasteful work. Imagine if things like mains plugs changed every few months, with appliancemakers all adopting the newest backwards-incompatible version. In some ways software is easier to change than hardware, but at the same time we must remember that effort needs to be expended to perform these changes as well, effort that could be used in other ways, and often there is a lot of interconnectedness in the systems we are trying to change.",1388462635

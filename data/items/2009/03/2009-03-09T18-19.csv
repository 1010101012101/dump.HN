Hust because we make hundreds of billions of numbers available tomorrow, doesn't mean those people will be routable for fractions of a cent. There are plenty of logistical problems (RIB size, portability) besides the artificial ""scarcity"" of IP addresses that retard universal fixed addressing.<p>The rest of your argument just seems like hand-waving. What fraction of ""creativity"" on the Internet depends on end-station addressing? Web applications don't care what number your laptop claims, and neither does email or IM. If addressing is hurting creativity, it's because you're being creative at the wrong layer of the stack.",1236625145

  * find 3-6 solutions, pick the one most valued/recommended/easiest/etc
  * slap down the debit card
  * never think about that roadblock again

Consider this to be the rambling opinion of a guy who likes looking at web sites.<p><i>he complains about snipd (first example) having too many colors on the frontpage, yet praises Basecamp (last example) even though they have even more colors on their front page.</i><p>The problem with Snipd isn't the colors. It's the fact that the colors don't contast well. There's faded-green next to vivid-green, cream with orange, and a lot of colors that don't fit well together. (I think when it was first posted here I said it reminded me of a liver spot, and the blue at the bottom felt like athlete's foot.) The Basecamp one, meanwhile, really pops. You get that really comforting dark-on white, there's lots of padding, and it all feels very cozy. (I particularly like that they contrast the red of the Basecamp page with the green of the sign-up button on top.) It's not perfect, but I thought nitpicking would detract from the message.<p><i>Comparing Snipd's service to Google, and saying that Google does a better job of conveying information because they have less of it on their frontpage is a bit too easy. Snipd's service is substantially more complicated and unknown than Googles (seen from a user perspective, of course)</i><p>That's worth a completely different write-up: it's a big problem if people don't know why they should use your product. I don't get the point of clipping sites, so I don't know what design <i>would</i> work well for one. On the other hand, there are a lot of search sites, and Google was the one that figured out exactly what they were supposed to do.<p>I was thinking about using Zooomr rather than Snipd, but Zooomr is so incredibly awful that I didn't want to use it in an article like this. Zooomr I can't help but laugh at. Snipd actually works very well: they just have an ugly front page.",1236624356

Were it a legal product, they would be entrepreneurs.  There are many aspects of accounting, logistics, and supply chain management that go into being a continually successful purveyor of recreational drugs.  It's a fickle industry - made significantly worse by the fear of legal repercussion.  
Unfortunately, things being how they are, some are forced to continue this risky lifestyle because legitimate jobs are getting harder and harder to come by and ""weed dealer"" doesn't really look that good on paper.

Have a single column of options that can be expanded/condensed accordion style (think the Mac MS Word formatting sidebar).<p>2.  Buttons produced are only a single image.  It would be nice if multiple images/sprites were created (that is, a single image file, with multiple images).  The additional images would enable hover and on click capabilities, providing a user with visual feedback that the image is indeed a button, and that it is working.  That being said, you may also need to include the relevant CSS necessary for a user to select the correct sprite in each situation.<p>3.  Having the Undo/Redo on the top right seems a bit unnatural.

A common misbelief is that Shakespeare only wrote in iambic pentameter and used weird language because his stuff is old. That's not the case. People in Shakespeare's day wrote plays that look and feel like normal plays. Shakespeare believed, though, that he could write plays so grandiose that they transcended everyday reality to become timeless. He wrote challenging lines to force people to dedicate themselves to his performances. His stuff is absolute poetry in a way that writing almost never is.<p>I hated Shakespeare when I was 16. I was lucky enough to get a teacher good enough to explain why Shakespeare is as acclaimed as he is. Since then I haven't said a bad word about him. He's so incredible that it's hard to look at his stuff objectively, so it's easy to criticize him unless you actually look at <i>what he did.</i>",1236622388

A friend of mine can make $900 a week off of CPM revenues.  While this wouldn't be enough money to run a 10 or even 5 person startup, it is plenty for him to cover his rent, car payment, and costs of living.<p>At the same time, I've been talking to a friend who is looking to start up a website that follows more in the footsteps of YouSendIt.  We've had several conversations on whether its more valuable to offer a service for free to build market share and then suffer the pains of losing users when you switch to a paid model or charging from the beginning and seeing much slower growth.  I appreciated that the article at least addressed the fear of switching to a paid model, but I would have been interested to hear how Kumaran thinks YouSendIt would have done if they would have launched with a freemium model already in place.",1236622243

The only argument is over how big they'll be.<p>Run the numbers on every proposal you see.  Compare the total salaries for the ""jobs created"" to the projected revenue (ridership * average fare).

(The train in the US wasn't high-speed, FWIW.)<p>This works nicely in Japan, especially, as the train frequencies on the Shinkansen are almost the same as commuter trains.  If you don't have a reservation, you can just get on whatever train you like.  This convenience would obviously never work for airlines.<p><i>Personally I think the big advantage is passenger comfort. The comfort level of a high speed train, even in 2nd class, is better than first class on a plane.</i><p>I think the convenience is that trains can go to the city-center.  Everywhere I go, it always adds an extra hour on each end to get from the city center to the airport.  (Chicago Midway and NY LaGuardia are a bit different in this respect.)<p>Even with not-that-high-speed trains, this seems to make it convenient enough to consider using.  I know the Boston/Washington DC corridor benefits from this.  (They are all short flights, but it is a pain to go from the city center to the airport, wait a while, spend 30 minutes on the plane, and then go from the airport to the destination city center.  If you take the train, you cut out all the waiting and needless travel, you arrive at your actual destination.)",1236621724

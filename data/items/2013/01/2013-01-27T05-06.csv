On an intra frame in prior testing Theora did enormously better than VP8 on this clip for these reasons.

But this would be an erroneous conclusion.<p>And sure, perhaps you'd get the same result on other clips. Over high-profile H264 the only obvious format feature that come to mind that could really let VP8 get ahead are the 'truemotion' intra-predictor and creative use of the synthetic reference frame (though I suppose the vp8 developers might have other suggestions) and I'd expect those features to only be big wins on a small number of clips so it wouldn't be hard to miss the cases where VP8 really shines over high profile h264.<p>But you (or I) could have said that without doing the test at all, and there would be 100% fewer clueless people going around claiming that something was proven here that wasn't.

I have been following the work of Laurie Santos at Yale on the question of primate theory of mind and her studies of capuchin monkeys.

The example given was that the URL might change, and clients would be able to follow along like humans; but unlike humans, which can autonomously start using new functionality and new site organization, computers are very unlikely to be able to automatically provide a useful submission to a new API - and if the API doesn't change (or is backward compatible), there is no good reason to change the URL unless the URL is excessively coupled to the implementation.  The only other benefit I can think of is that humans testing the API might use the list of available API calls, which is actually pretty reasonable, but the article seems to be articulating this as something more fundamental than a debugging aid.<p>In other words, how is this a good thing?",1359265360

Instead of verifying a single implementation, it's often better for somebody to reimplement the idea from scratch; if a second implementation in a different language written by a different programmer gets the same results, this is a much more thorough validation of the software than going over prototype software line by line.<p>Also, I've seen way too many software engineers come in with an enterprisey attitude of establishing all sorts of crazy infrastructure and get absolutely no work done. If Java is your idea of a good time, it's unlikely that you'll be an effective researcher (though it's not unheard of), because it's not good at maximizing single-programmer output, and not good at maximizing I/O or CPU or string processing. In research it's best to get results, fail fast fast <i>fast</i>, and move on to the next idea. If you're lucky, 1 in 20 will work out. Publish your crap, and if it's a good idea, it will be worth polishing the turd later, but it's better to explore the field then to spend too much time on an uninteresting area.<p>The only time you worry about efficiency is when it enables a whole other level of analysis. So, for example, UCSC does most of their work in C, including an entire web app and framework written in C, because when they were doing the draft assembly of human genome a decade ago on a small cluster of computers that they scrounged from secretaris' desks over the summer, Perl wouldn't cut it.",1359265182

5123171,comment,5123035,5123151,3,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Sounding southern though is (at least for me, living in Arkansas) very different from sounding ""redneck"".</i><p>The problem of many speakers of southern dialects of English in much of the United States is that speakers of broadcast varieties of General American English tend to lump all ""southern accents"" in a category that includes the redneck accents and the plantation-owner-descendant accents without further distinction. And that is why, as the article reports, there is an employment opportunity disadvantage (on average, other things being equal) to sounding like any kind of southerner.<p>(I have been to all fifty states, having traveled to many states as a Chinese-English interpreter on contract for International Visitors Program of the United States Department of State. I can remember one case of a very upper-crust Mississipian, who was then living in Alabama, having an English accent that to my Midwestern ear was quite nonstandard, even though I was aware that in the south it would be taken to be the accent of an educated person from prosperous family.)",1359263737

One of which was to make sure no unauthorized software was installed, and yes they had CD Burners back then and saw that as a security risk for copying information.<p>You will find that not all federal systems are secure and run by experts. Some federal employees are not qualified for their jobs, and that is why federal contractors are hired to make up for it. For example some of our servers and systems were not behind a firewall and had public Internet IP addresses. I agree a shared account is a security risk, and when someone changed the password to the maintenance account we were locked out and had to file a form to learn the new password. In fact to do anything like install software or configure a system we had to file a form first.<p>Yes the federal government and chain of command requires that I file a request before I use a new software product. Even if it can be downloaded and run in the home directory, if I don't get permission for it, I am in deep trouble. So much as refreshing an IP address, if I do it myself I am in trouble, I have to call their help desk and have them refresh and renew it for me.",1359263735

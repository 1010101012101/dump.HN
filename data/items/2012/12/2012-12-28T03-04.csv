There are plenty of people who aren't involved in any given project, but would still be qualified to give decent advice.<p>Developers should consider random opinions, just not if they conflict with the direction of the software. If a number of users have similar grievances, that is an indicator that something needs to be fixed, or maybe the direction of the software should be changed slightly.<p>That's if the developer intends the software to be widely-used, of course",1356667190

And I wanted to add this in because I think its the most important thing, and easy to lose sight of.<p>One more thing, before I forget: another useful thing to do is to contrast ""make things that people want to buy"" with some common alternatives: ""make cool things"" or ""make something the way it <i>should</i> be made"" or even ""think about how to make things"". These are all easy traps to fall into.<p>In many ways, I feel like ""make things people want to buy"" is the economic equivalent of the Buddhist prescription to end suffering, ""Eradicate craving and aversion."" Simple enough sounding, but it has far-reaching repercussions and quite a lot of fruit for thought.<p>I'll look up Dalio - although strictly speaking he is wrong. There are plenty of ways to make money without making what people want. For example, any kind of passive income. You would have to stretch the definition of ""thing"" beyond breaking to let it describe ""capital"". Passive income is at best a kind of 'second-order' ""making things"" fraught with every kind of moral hazard.",1356667078

Most of this is noise. Look for alignment with the advice of the dead, especially if this has withstood the test of time.

PulseOx is useless if your patient isn't perfusing their periphery well (either due to hypothermia, or shock). You also need to consider that it only measures the percentage of hemoglobin that is bound to _something_, that something could just as easily be carbon monoxide.

I had a disk that had slipped gradually over the previous several years. Exquisitely painful episodes 3-4 times a year. Certainly not helped by my weight and lack of muscle tone. After a year of lifting I noticed that I recovered from these episodes quicker, and that the intervals between them were longer. I think it's well over a year now since the last. Obviously, don't even think about lifting if you are currently suffering back pain.<p>I believe there is general agreement that any strength program will be based around low-rep sets of exercises that involve a large number of muscle groups. Typically squats, power cleans, dead lifts, overhead presses and bench presses. Rippetoe's Starting Strength book and DVD are an excellent introduction to these. Eventually (6 - 18 months) you will plateau and need to change program. I'm currently using Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 and so far am very happy with it, but a beginner will progress faster with Rippetoe.<p>If you don't mind some extra, unsolicited advice;<p>- start with much lighter weights than you think you can handle and aim for regular, small weekly increases - even a pound or two is fine and quickly adds up.<p>- Be prepared to end a session the moment you feel any discomfort in your lower back, and don't return until it clears up completely. I didn't do this at first and each time ended up unable to train for a fortnight.<p>- technique matters. While these lifts are nothing like as complex as the olympic lifts, there is still some technique that you need to learn for your safety, and also to allow progress to occur. If possible film yourself from time to time to check you're not developing bad habits.<p>Good luck - and have fun.",1356665897

In the private sector you will either be doing this or working for someone that does it. And when it comes to innovation, it's wierd when you think about it: humans have lived thousands of years without [whatever it is you invented]. So why would they want it? The thing is humans are curious creatures, always interested in new things, so it's always possible to get them to try new things. (It's not always about innovation though, sometimes it's about being more efficient and winning on price.)<p>(Also contained within this directive is the (sad) fact that you can spend quite a lot of time focused on the 'want' side, manipulating people into wanting to buy something.)<p>The innovation route is a daunting task.

As far as Linux having some catching up to do, how often does this situation occur? I also believe the most valuable lesson to learn here is the one you can do nothing about: no matter how adamant you are about your dearest and most basic rules (we've heard Linus many times on code that break user-space), shit happens.<p>His frustration appears to stem from (rightful) presumptions that a kernel developer would not make such newbie mistakes.<p>I totally agree with you that this exchange should not have been so public, unfortunately kernel communication is by design. I would, however, also like to provide a different perspective. Linus is carrying the burden of being a bully, he does a dirty job of publicly berating people from whom he expects nothing but the best, everything about his handling of these situations shakes our moral fibre and makes him appear a dis-likable human being. But then, we're millions to enjoy the fruit of this dirty job everyday, blinding ourselves to what it takes to provide it. Such is often the burden of leaders.",1356664249

It is not possible for ioctl to be called on a valid, open file descriptor that represents a file that is not valid or available. Even if the file is unlinked after being opened, the kernel will ensure that it remains available to any processes that have it open until they close the file descriptor.<p><i>Like when it is returning a cached entry or dealing with some container, where a notion of an entry does make sense.</i><p>I honestly don't know what you mean by this. ioctls, like nearly all Unix system calls, are file system operations, they necessarily and by definition refer to files.<p><i>Insisting that ENOENT is reserved for path operations seems asinine.</i><p>On the contrary, ENOENT has meant ""No such file or directory"" since the early days of Unix history. Arbitrarily deciding to redefine it now would be asinine. There are other errno values to represent other error conditions.",1356663982

Instacart prices are 10-15% above Safeway prices, but their customers don't care on average, and that's how they make money. Delivery fees are a necessary evil.<p>- For premium pizza, ""get it now"" is really great, but their business model is not sustainable: I never paid for delivery, and they only charge 5% out of which they pay 2.5% for CC processing. The fact that they want to scale now and expand to further categories without having nailed their primary suppliers (fancy restaurants that do take out but don't deliver) seems crazy to me.<p>- For other types of goods, one hour delivery is a bit too much, and you feel bad the first time. But then, hell it is practical, and in many ways it seems much more relevant and ecological that having an item shipped from a random warehouse in the middle of the country, boxed specifically for me, etc...Same day/next day would do in 99% of the cases though.",1356663943

To me you'd be better off NOT releasing it, and just keeping it all wrapped up and closed, then you wouldn't have to deal with the non-contributing users who want changes.<p>This is one of the fundamental problems around many (most?) OSS projects. The elitism that comes with believing you are somehow better than everyone else because you contributed, or started an OSS project.<p>This attitude also stumps your growth - many people who probably would contribute often end up staying in the shadows, not wanting to look stupid, or offend the sensibilities of the OSS team.<p>Perhaps a more welcoming attitude might not only make people more supporting of OSS, but might find you some more willing contributors as well?<p>What are you building open source software for, if not to be used by consumers? If you're building it for some sense of self-aggrandisement, why make it open source in the first place? Just keep it nicely closed, so that only the elite chosen few ever get access to it, and keep out those who's opinions apparently don't matter.<p>Open source (for many) is a way to pay it forward, and give back.

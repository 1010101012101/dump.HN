For the most part, computers in schools have been an expensive distraction, wasting money that could have been better spent on things proven to improve student performance like textbooks, better teacher/student ratio's, facility upgrades (hard to learn without good heating/AC), etc.<p>IMHO, the root of the problem is that just <i>having</i> computers (or ipads, or whatever) in the classroom doesn't magically educate students through osmosis.  You need an actual valid plan for <i>how</i> you're gonna use the computer.  Where does it fit into the lesson plan, what activity is time with the computer replacing, etc.   And unfortunately that usually seems to be lacking.<p>The rush to buy computers and iPad's for classrooms never seems to be based on a solid educational plan, it's all about administrators and schoolboard members wanting to show of the ""exciting accomplishment"" of equipping all the classrooms with something shiny and impressive looking.",1281477509

So that gives the current HP an advantage.<p>He also misses the point of Hurd's financial dealings which was to prop up HP's existing business.  The reason for all the acquisitions is because the PC and Printer businesses aren't doing so great (HP's Printer Market Share has fallen 19% since 2003 and while its PC market share is up 3% since 2002 it is lower than the combined share that HP and Compaq had pre-merger).  Meaning a split of the company would only serve to produce a failing PC company, a failing Printer company and a succeeding IT services firm.  A move that would destroy investor value not increase it.",1281477472

I did almost nothing programming-related.<p>At a certain point, about 6 months in, I simply lost interest in playing games, and went back to programming.  I felt rejuvenated -- actually, I felt like a completely different developer.  I was now way, way more productive than I ever had been before.<p>So, take my story for what it's worth.  It may not work for everyone, but the takeaway is, I once had a mindset very similar to ""All day I've been tempted to just pop an Advil PM and go to sleep. But if I stop moving, I'm fucked, so on I go coding.""

The human brain is a wondrous thing, so even with such a horrible method of teaching eventually smart people will pick things up. But it's a very inefficient and error prone method.<p>The right way to teach is to start with an abstract, low-fidelity model and then build upon that. Once students have a good mastery of the model then you can delve down into fine-grained specifics (how each component works, for example) and only then can you evolve the model into a more accurate representation.<p>That's why good teachers are so rare.

It's easier to build robots into the things they automate than to build general-purpose 'human like' robots that can operate things the way humans do.   It''s better to make robots that are decidedly non-human, and even that look decidedly non-robotic,  In fact.  Having a human-like shape and a human-like brain would be a liability, in most cases.  Why do you need a full human-emulation to slap my logo on a hundred T shirts?  You don't.<p>I think that most of the work at McDonalds, actually, is done by robots already.  I mean, the people on the location mostly just reheat mostly pre-molded and pre-cooked stuff.  I bet that the over sized vending machine I describe could do this job cheaper now (especially where land is expensive.)  -  I bet it's cultural issues that prevent the vending machine approach;  people have negative associations with vending machine food, and people like being served by other humans.<p>>I think you forget that the assembly line worker has not really been obsoleted. They have merely been reduced during industrialism and are now being outsourced to india. But many  people are still employed at an assembly line. Quite likely the pants or shirt you are wearing were sewed in Bangladesh, on a slave labor assembly line.<p>Hati and Mexico, actually, I just looked, so yeah, you have a strong point.     I believe the turning point here, though, will be when wealth is equalized a bit more, meaning workers in india demand a little more money rather than when robots get cheaper.<p>On the other hand, I think that if wages were more equal, we have the technology to automate away most of the human involvement in manufacturing.   I also have some shirts made in the USA...  do you want to bet that American Apparel uses fewer man hours to complete a T shirt than the Haitian company that made the shirt I'm wearing now?    Considering that bulk American Apparel shirts usually aren't even twice as expensive as the shirts manufactured in Haiti, I would imagine that they are using a whole lot more automation.<p>Incidentally, the Haitian made shirt I'm wearing now?  my company logo was printed on it by a company running out of the USA.  As I chose the cheapest printing I could find without regard to the country the work was being done in, I imagine the American factory doing that screen printing was extremely well-automated.<p>But my point is that the robotic revolution is here. It has been accelerating for some time now, but it's not a new thing.<p>The thing is, this 'robotic revolution' won't be heralded by walking into McDonalds and seeing commander data manning the deep fryer.  The human shape and the human brain is a very general purpose tool, so optimized shapes for particular jobs will always be the most efficient way to build robots, outside of social constraints.",1281475329

Pointing out interest is not the same as attacking someone's identity.  Your example is false; it is not like saying someone's argument should be ignored because ""he's a senator.""  It's like pointing out that a senator is arguing for a bill that benefits a company he holds stock in.  There's nothing convoluted or ad hominem about it.",1281474477

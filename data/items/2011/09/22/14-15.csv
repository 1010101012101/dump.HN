(CS)",,"Hi, HN.<p>As the title suggests I'm in the process of choosing a university (UK, US) and an undergraduate program for me to apply, and, honestly, I have no clue how to make the right decision. I've browsed university websites, read guides and asked for advice from people I know, but I'm yet to find the proper answer.<p>The thing I want from a university is a solid theoretical background in CS. I'm not a programmer yet, but I care deeply about the ways people approach computing, and my goal in the long run is to be able to build programs even on the lowest levels of abstraction. I probably need CS for that. I don't care about employment opportunities as long as I can support myself and code the way I feel is right. I would be incredibly disappointed to see Java, C or anything corporate in my curriculum. I need theory, not a job at MS.<p>I've got my BS in Management and (if you forgive a lame pun) I've come to realize what a total BS it is. I know Ruby reasonably well; although I'm a total '() in Lisp (Scheme) and Smalltalk, I feel like these two language are gems in their respective domains, and for this reason I'm now making my way through the famous SICP lectures and a Smalltalk-80 book.<p>I really hope to get some response, because I know you are all smart and have a lot valuable experience to share. Sorry for the rant.",1316703586

These days, with the advent of easy to integrate Javascript/Python/Ruby/Lua scripting languages, there is very little reason to write an entire application in C.  My last two projects, I wrote the business logic in a scripting language, and all of the performance bound stuff in C.  There are a few gotchas the first time you do this - your bindings code needs to fit with the object model that you're using in C, you need to force all calls into the VM onto the same thread etc.  I ended up just writing my own IDL parser/bindigs generator, but once you've done that once, you can use it for all of your future projects, and it really isn't that much work.  The pay-off is huge - you can arbitrarily move a module of code between C and your scripting language depending on the optimal split for performance/ease of programming.",1316703456

3026255,comment,3025391,3026127,3,0,dap,,,"It's a relatively common pattern to have a ""collection"" data structure (like a list or hash table) use link structs embedded inside other structs to simplify memory management.  When you append to a linked list in Java, you always allocate a new Link object and then update the various pointers.  Using this pattern in C, the object you want to put in a list <i>contains</i> a list_link_t structure, and the list library takes as arguments pointers to these structures.  This may sound like an argument about convenience, but the implications of this are very significant: if you have to allocate memory, the operation can fail.  So in the C version (unlike the Java one) you can control exactly in which contexts something can fail.<p>For example, if you want to trigger some operation after some number of second elapses, you can preallocate some structure and then just populate it and fill it in when the timeout fires.  Timeouts are usually just signals or other contexts where you have no way to return failure, so it's important that it be possible to always handle that case correctly without the possibility of failing.",1316703229

Please don't get intimidated by such posts.<p>Best case is always when third parties talk about you AND NOT YOURSELF. With third parties I have news sites or at least well know blogs in mind. That's the best reference the net can give you. To come there isn't easy and the result of some work, don't give in to the temptation to post 24/7 your status on Twitter or blogs, nobody cares and there so many douches having ZERO achievements but are the #1 spammer when it comes to social stuff.<p>To come back to the management profiles: a classic CV is still much better because you are able to finetune and direct its content to the potential employee. One full-blown LinkedIn profile won't fit all -- a basic profile is more than sufficient and can be extended in a CV.<p>A last note: when we (friends or colleagues) notice that somebody is extensively working on his/her public profiles (like LinkedIn) and adding information, achievements etc., we know => this guy is looking for a new job and we literally feel his despair. Sometimes it's good to let everybody know that you need a new challenge but again: regarding management jobs you need to be much more subtle and try to signal your strengths in a different way.",1316702203

I never tried to turn these throw away logging implementations into a stand alone project or anything. It took about 20 lines of code to get a simple one working.

He very likely means ""source code"" and not, say, ""FTP site"".<p>> Frankly, it really is just baffling to me that you are defending this so aggressively to the point of accusing others of outright dishonesty when discussing it. Do you really think that appropriate?<p>Yes.  It's like ""pro-choice"" or like ""organic farming"": one group of people is using this term with a specific idiomatic meaning, and there are other people who want to associate themselves with that meaning in order to free-ride off the goodwill that comes with it, but without paying the price.  An anti-abortion politician isn't ""pro-choice"" because they support school vouchers, an apricot sprayed with malathion isn't ""organic"" because it contains carbon compounds, and a free-for-noncommercial-use program isn't ""open-source"" because its source code isn't secret.",1316701007

All the logging packages are focused toward formatting and logging short text messages for humans to read.<p>This is nice initially, but with large volumes of logging you want to perform statistics (what errors / error codes are most common? which users make most use of a certain API call? etc). In which case it's kind of duplicate work to write formatters and parsers for every message type.<p>I know there is the ""RFC5424 structured logging"" standard but it's not really widely supported yet. So generally I end up dumping to some JSON-based format instead of using a logging toolkit.<p>Then again, I'm not up-to-date in Java logging.

Unfortunately, java.util.logging sucks (hard to customize, coupling with J2EE app servers). So people keep using log4j.<p>Library writers now have a problem: How do you choose which logging framework to use? You really want to use the same framework as your users, the developers making apps. Thus was born commons-logging.<p>commons-logging has a number of problems, including non-deterministic setup and being bundled with some common app servers (which creates its own share of problems).<p>Thus: slf4j. Which works.<p>I agree with the author that slf4j is the way to go. Alternatively you can just use log4j directly. But slf4j has one feature which log4j doesn't: format strings. If you've ever had to add ""if (log.isDebuggingEnabled())"" checks to logging code you'll appreciate what a difference this makes.<p>In conclusion: Java logging is a clusterfuck, but if you know what to use you'll be fine.

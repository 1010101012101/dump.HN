I hang out in the #chocolat channel on Freenode. My take on it is the developer sincerely cares about making a great editor, and it has always been pretty simple to use. The economics of being yet another code editor are not great and Alex is the only owner and developer yet he is still dedicated to the project. I am not sure you will ever see the kind of ecosystem that TextMate and Sublime Text enjoy, but if you can see past its faults, chocolat is a pretty nice little editor.",1413561518

8471574,comment,8471355,8471565,0,0,bradgignac,,,"I&#x27;ve had the same experience - very little need for generics in Go on a regular basis. I really appreciated the following snippet from <a href=""http://robnapier.net/go-is-a-shop-built-jig"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robnapier.net/go-is-a-shop-built-jig</a>:<p>&quot;Probably the biggest complaint people have with Go is the lack of generics. And I did run into that in just the first couple of weeks of work on my project, and I wound up with a bunch of duplicated code to work around it. And then, when it was all working, I refactored out the duplicated code. And I refactored again. And in the end, the whole thing was simpler and shorter than what I would have done with generics. So again, in the end, Go turned out to be a language for solving real problems rather than a language filled with beautiful tools, and so you build real solutions rather than finding excuses to use your beautiful tools. Don’t try to make Go what it isn’t. If you’re trying to solve abstract CS problems in their most generalized forms, then you may find it frustrating. But if you’re trying to solve specific, practical problems in the forms professional developers typically encounter, Go is quite nice.&quot;",1413561421

8471563,comment,8470337,8470337,0,0,felixgallo,,,"The fundamental problem here is that desktop Linux users, who have absolutely had a bad experience over the decades, have gotten so tired of incompetently executed half-assed solutions that they now grab at any other solution with the fervor of a drowning victim.<p>Why have they gotten to this point?  Because the people working on desktop have generally been the D-team.  The A-team is working on kernels and infrastructure, the B-team turns out packaging, and the D-team has been coming up with hair-raising stuff like gnome, &#x27;desktop bus&#x27;, pulseaudio, enlightenment.<p>So this weird little monoculture has emerged in which no other concern matters except that they get rescued from drowning -- that their boot times (!?!?) go to 5 seconds from 10, that hot-plugging USB drives (!?!?!?!) be wrapped in with the init system if it helps at all, that DHCP (!!??!?!?!?!!) and core files (!!!!!!!!) and all logging (!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!) be taken over in the name of helping even 1% on the core experience.<p>But at the same time, two basic axioms of reality still bear:<p>1.  Linux on the desktop is irrelevant and will never win, both in terms of the Linux story and in absolute terms; and every scrap of effort that goes into it has been objectively wasted for two decades and will continue to be wasted.<p>2.  Linux everywhere else has been working fine for longer than most of the desktop people have been alive.<p>following from (2), the people who run servers recognize that although systemd has some good ideas, it forcibly bundles together a grip of super bad ones too, and is clearly implemented by people who don&#x27;t understand systems outside of the desktop.<p>The attempt to turn Debian back into a distribution for everyone, rather than a small collection of desktop people, is completely valid and sensible.  That said, it&#x27;s totally clear why the desktop people want it this way, and why they have such a misguided emotional investment in their terrible new windows emulator.",1413561285

A master who can&#x27;t teach, or at least set an example, is going to have employment issues.  Life on the floor was not really different than my experiences in IT... boss selects a new tool, you will use it in at most a couple days of fooling around, or find a new job, doesn&#x27;t matter if its machining or IT.  If you&#x27;re the wisest employee, you can expect to get assigned to the new toy and to train the other employees informally if nothing more advanced.<p>There is/was a continuous and constant struggle between the school instructor component of an apprenticeship and the masters on the job.  The instructors want cool sexy toys and resume stuffers like teaching cutting edge tools, but the masters on the job want the instructors to teach the basics.  There is also a lot of general experience aka &quot;we don&#x27;t do centerless grinding machining here, so I hope your classroom instructor is covering at least the basics&quot;.  And the masters continually complained about instructors who taught the kids the basics of g-code but not how to read a print, lots of &quot;walk before you run&quot; complaining.<p>At least this is how it was at a former employer for machinists, tool and die makers, millwrights, and industrial electricians.  I have no first hand data about plumbers and carpenters.<p>Something that confuses youth culture on HN is it takes a kid 16 or so years of study to learn &quot;2014 work&quot;.  So they freak out that a 40 year old dude would have to stop working completely for 16 years to learn &quot;2024 work&quot;.  Reality of course is that things develop VERY slowly and most of the 16 years of school are focused on 2000-4000 years of human development.  Actual development is so slow in most large industries like machining or IT coding, that its not hard at all to keep up other than anecdotes and complainers and people who&#x27;ve basically retired on the job.",1413559986
8471460,comment,8470337,8471342,0,0,acdha,,,"> Why are you using Debian then? Debian is about flexibility<p>That&#x27;s really a fundamental misrepresentation of Debian. As a Debian user since around 1997 or so, the value has always been that you get solid, tested packages which work out of the box – almost everything you need is an apt-get away and it&#x27;s <i>consistent</i> across all of the systems with the same packages installed. When I was responsible for somewhat over a hundred systems (servers & desktops) that was invaluable for delivering a consistent user experience.<p>Maximum flexibility would be something more like Gentoo where you can play around with config options and rebuild software with arcane flags, with the expectation that you&#x27;re comfortable spending time diagnosing anything which breaks if you hit a combination which hasn&#x27;t been well tested by anyone else.<p>This is highly relevant to the discussion above because consistency starts becoming a LOT more work when you start needing to coordinate between multiple major projects. If you want, e.g., Firefox or Chrome to be able to use a webcam just after it&#x27;s plugged in that requires communication a bunch of large code-bases (kernel, GNOME, audio daemon, browser, probably some sort of permission system which may or may not be in one or more of these, etc.) and all of that is either going to be harder or slower if you have to support a bunch of different systems with differing designs, bugs and it&#x27;s a tax which people who don&#x27;t support Debian won&#x27;t have to pay.<p>Remembering the era where people just accepted that things like audio or video wouldn&#x27;t work on Linux because it was too much hassle, I appreciate the value of a single target.",1413559977

After reading this interview I still don&#x27;t understand. A fork without clear purpose can seem like a waste of resources and market fragmentation and that will lead to some resentment.

In fact, if you asked a lot of people if we should help the Big Three with this sort of legislation, you might be surprised by the answer. Remember, they generate a LOT of jobs in this state: not just the Big Three, but the tier 2 and tier 3 manufactors. While I think logic would win out in the day, I wouldn&#x27;t assume that everybody in Michigan _wants_ Tesla. It isn&#x27;t in their best interest.<p>This is about helping dealerships, not manufacturers so you&#x27;d think that any support for the Big Three manufactures wouldn&#x27;t correlate with support for this bill.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2014/10/16/tesla-faces-direct-sales-ban-michigan/17359253/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2014/10/16/t...</a>\n[1] -<a href=""http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2014/10/17/michigan-verge-banning-tesla-stores/17386251/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2014/10/17/michigan-ve...</a>",1413558152

There are 4 states in the US with larger populations than the Netherlands. However, news is generally distributed at the national and local levels (local news stations and national media outlets). Very few people watch local news anymore, so local news tends to be more like Buzzfeed than informative. National news is headed that way as well.<p>Overall though, people aren&#x27;t interested in stories about corruption. So the politicians get away with it, because stories about OMG EBOLA WILL KILL YOU draw more viewers than yet another political corruption story.",1413558120

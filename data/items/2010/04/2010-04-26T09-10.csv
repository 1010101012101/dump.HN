The fact is that symbols are treated more systematically in Mathematica, and that makes it easier to assemble and dissemble symbolic structures of all sorts.<p>Sounds like a case of blub. You look at Mathematica and see some weird stuff that is probably equivalent in power to multimethods or whatever, I look at Lisp and think how can I possibly live without civilized pattern matching.<p>As far as Lisp-based AI goes, its in fact very easy to miss it, but this is probably not the thread to get into Lisp's cultural issues.",1272275975

1294494,comment,1294483,1294483,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"So, last March, after two startup ideas bombed, I was doing some research on where online advertising revenue was being spent. I figured that if I was going to even partially monetize with ad revenue, it made sense to figure out what topics and niches were paying.<p>As part of that research, I ended up purchasing a list of the top 50k paying keywords off a shady looking website.  The site only took PayPal, and they were only charging 50 bucks, so I figured it was worth it, and I wasn't risking too much aside from exposing my PayPal account, so I bought it.<p>I was pretty skeptical of the data at first, but I randomly spot checked around 50 search terms, with my Adsense account, and they seemed to correlate pretty closely.<p>I then wrote a script to cross reference how much people were paying for each set of keywords with how many results were returned for those keywords.  That gave me a ratio of High cost keywords::number of results, which was enlightening.<p>Mind you, this data is suspect.  Google doesn't charge a fixed rate for their advertising rates, from what I understand, each time an ad is served, the price essentially depends on an auction and the price varies accordingly.  Also, I bought this data off a shady looking website during a really low point in one of the worst economies in decades.  <i>Caveat Emptor</i><p>That being said, I thought you might find it interesting.",1272275092

Of course, internet content was always of variable quality, but up until the late 1990s, maybe early 2000s, <i>most</i> random pages on some subject were written by someone who actually had some sort of interest in it. Given a geocities page on some random subject, it might well be <i>crazy</i>, but it was usually in good faith: the person really was saying it in their own voice, because they wanted to, not because they were being paid some pennies per paragraph to write it.<p>The rise of a few specific sites with decent, non-spammy info is the only thing that's really saved its usefulness for me.

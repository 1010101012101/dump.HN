I've looked into them, and have implemented a similar (and simpler) templating system that is easy for designers to use. Eventually I would like to have lots of built-in customizable web2.0 style templates. I cannot compare too much though because I put in way more features.

Inside that server, various resources we use to organize development such as subversion, trac, irc, build system, etc. are isolated into separate vserver partitions.  Later when we need to move everything onto dedicated server(s) it's clear and obvious how to do it.<p>",1190216138

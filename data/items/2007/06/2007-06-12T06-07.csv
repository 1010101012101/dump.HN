27411,comment,27166,27166,0,0,gojomo,,,"I predict it will be easy in 10 years (and sooner with a large enough budget). High-res cameras will be no larger than a tiny segment of football lacing, or basketball inflation pins/pumps -- as are built into retail balls today with little effect on playability. Advanced optics will allow extremely wide-angle views in multiple directions. Fast computers will compensate for any rotations. <p>As others note, though, placing cameras in balls may not be as interesting to fans as other options, like player cams. (Beyond Justin.tv, what about LeBron.tv or Peyton.tv?)",1181630325

That said, Lisp isn't a really a pure functional language either if that is what you are implying (setf).  I don't know enough about Erlang to say anything about that.  It is odd that they specify ""procedural"" though.  Anyone that knows a programming language probably knows a procedural programming language.",1181629496

It's an ambitious problem for sure but the potential reward justifies the risk.  Actually I think the biggest risk is that Google probably has a team working on natural language search that could beat them to it (this is just me speculating I have no insider knowledge).",1181628707

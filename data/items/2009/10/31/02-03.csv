The people who are most successful in business understand people, and that's what this book teaches.  Understanding people and being good at interacting with people will take you a lot further in business than reading about why our economy failed.",1256957937

913193,comment,912712,912712,0,0,andrewvc,,,"These two services behave so differently, it's hard to do a real cost breakdown. It depends on your app. Here are some issues with comparisons between EY and Heroku (I'm leaving Joyent out because I have no experience with them):<p>1. There's no reason to believe that 6 mongrels on an EY small EC2 instance == 6 thins on whatever EC2 size Heroku is using. They need to be benchmarked.<p>2. DB Performance needs to be benchmarked. EY uses MySQL, Heroku uses Postgres or Amazon RDS (MySQL). I've heard that their postgres db is substantially faster than RDS.<p>3. Heroku gives you varnish, and it doesn't cost you any dynos. If you can use cache control headers, varnish is your friend. On EY you'll likely use Rack::Cache, which is fine, but it hits a mongrel. Heroku also does gzip and SSL before it hits your server, also saving you cycles.<p>4. App server redundancy with EY is expensive since you need a whole other small EC2 instance, with Heroku all your dynos are spread out.<p>5. If you want instant database failover (using MySQL replication), this is a extremely easy on EY, with Heroku it takes more work, you have to launch your own RDS instances. Of course, a small RDS instance is only $80/mo, beating EY and Heroku's DB offerings on price. RDS will have replication soon, probably at a lower price than EY. Of course, neither EY and Heroku haven't to my knowledge announced plans to drop their prices in November when amazon drops their EC2 prices by 15%. This would make both more competitive vs RDS.<p>6. EY likely has a better economy of scale, a 5ECU EY instance ($197 vs $125 for a 1ECU small) is probably more cost effective for CPU heavy requests than Heroku Dynos.<p>7. EY support ain't free. Keep in mind that EY support and monitoring are only there if you pay major extra $ on top of your infrastructure. It can easily nearly double your costs depending on your plan.<p>The cost of either one really will vary depending on which features you use heavily.",1256956860

913174,comment,912409,912939,0,0,michael_browne,,,"While it's true that procuring material/financial support from a man isn't the necessity it used to be for women, I would suggest they are still hard-wired, to an extent, as well as socially conditioned to be attracted to men with available resources (also consider the increasingly popular belief that an acceptable lifestyle requires two incomes.) Keep in mind, too, that emotional support is likely considered by women more important than it used to be. They are less likely today to be satisfied with a man who just goes to work everyday and is then distant and uninvolved in domestic life. This is another reason for women to be selective of their mate for what he can provide (rather than just who he is,) despite their opportunity to be financially self-sufficient.",1256955226

In particular, reading lists via NNTP from gmane in Thunderbird is pretty nice, with real threaded discussions going back as far as you want, and no need to sign up, etc. (screenshot: <a href=""http://hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/TextMate/gmane-thunderbird.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/TextMate/gmane-thunderbird.png</a>)<p>I really think the main problem is not the concept of mailing lists (and email/nntp) generally, but instead, as you suggest, the software that runs it. Google groups/mailman/etc. are all IMO pretty crappy from both maintainer and user perspectives, but they work well enough that no one's really putting effort into better mailing list software. Likewise, most mail clients are pretty crappy –either unconfigurable or with a difficult learning curve for configuration, with insufficiently easy-to-set-up and insufficiently flexible rule systems, etc. – when you get down to it. I should be able to absolutely instantly (<10 seconds) set up my email client to filter for only replies to my topics or mentions of my name in a particular mailing list (for example), but currently this is an involved process in every mail client I've ever used.<p>Of course, email is so so so much better for extended technical discussions than any web forum I've seen, that we all stick with it despite its flaws.",1256954474

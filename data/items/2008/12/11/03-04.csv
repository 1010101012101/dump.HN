Who else can maintain such an ugly beast as the JVM?<p>A nice point in the article is that many (most?) people that like Java started programming at the time it was created. Younger people think it is too clumsy, older people prefer C or C++. I personally started programming with Pascal and C, and hate the way Java downplays the capacity of its users. C#, although inheriting many of the problems in Java, is a much more interesting and inclusive language.",1228967924

393903,comment,393616,393616,0,0,mdasen,,,"What bothers me is how CNN has decided that succession implies insight.  By the screens, they:<p><pre><code>  1. ""saw the mortgage-related meltdown coming""\n  2. ""warned of a subprime contagion back in July 2007""\n  3. ""called both the dot-com and housing bubbles""\n  5. ""predicted two years ago that the credit bubble would devastate Wall Street""\n  7. ""was among the first to warn that the big banks had big problems""\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is that none of these people might have any insight.  Yes, they said something, then it came true.  However, astrologists say things that come true.  They're more wrong than they're right, but you can easily find astrologists who have gotten a few big things correct.  CNN has plastered up at least 5 of them as having the insight to see this mess coming.  If you and I decide today to make predictions - me that 2009 will see a resurgence and you that 2009 will be more of the current pain, one of us is going to look like a financial genius.  Well, at least to those who infer insight from a succession of events.  One of them even says, ""I was right a year ago, and I think I'll be right this year too.""<p>I have made one correct prediction for the future, therefore future predictions of mine are likely to be correct.  I guess I'm sick of the doom and gloom the media wants to sell us.  Part of what happens in economic crisis is that people stop trusting the economy.  In that distrust, people do things that aren't economically useful like hoarding (since they fear for the worst).  It's a natural reaction and these stories heighten that reaction making the crisis considerably worse.  People say credit is tight.  People (banks) hear that and don't want to lend money since they might need it to cover something unexpected.  As banks stop lending, credit actually becomes tight.<p>While I certainly don't believe this crisis is merely a factor of public perception, public perception can (and has) led to real problems in other nations and does cause problems like our current situation to become worse than it is - similarly, when we're all happy about the economy, our perception puts ourselves into a bigger boom than is real.<p>Live simply.  Don't overextend.  Save for the rainy days.  Ignore the news.",1228966806

There are those who simply throw up their hands and give up, and then there are those who just won't let it go. They'll keep it in the back of their mind, mulling it over, poking at it, discussing with others, until they finally have an epiphany in the shower or on the bus or in a dream. They do great things because they go where others fear to tread. Without tenacity, there's little hope of becoming a great programmer.<p>If tenacity is the base signal, working memory is the amplifier. The greater your working memory, the more concepts you can hold at once, which means you can break down problems much faster. Your potential is increased significantly.<p>All of this is capped off by creativity. Tenacity and working memory will allow you to push through a problem, but if you're not stepping back and looking for patterns and meta patterns to exploit, you'll miss any chance of finding novel solutions that save time, space, and aggravation compared to existing practices.",1347191094

As long as release dates are like that I would not buy for fun.I know a lot of people think the same; as long as non US is a second class citizen I don't see any company 'winning' anything. After a keynote you want to order. You don't want to wait and especially not when the product exists. This is even worse for virtual goods (music/software/movies etc), but for physical goods as well; if you cannot deliver it immediately then it doesn't exist for most people. And I know a lot non tech people who won't buy it; it seems that companies like this do not see that announcements are no longer local. When any company does an announcement it's in 'the papers' (virtual or real) immediately all across the planet, not only in the US. So people read, want to buy, cannot buy and go for your competitor who does have the capability to release worldwide. Newspaper articles mostly always mention the competitors. I personally know a lot of people who bought an iPad instead of a Fire in the first release because you simply couldn't get it here (the Amazon.com site doesn't allow you to order from EU for this item, so you need someone in the US). It's rancid and it needs to stop now.<p>Edit: the iPad / Fire price difference doesn't matter for most people from the Netherlands, that is something you need to know before reading this. We are known as frugal but in real life most people make a lot of money and just buy what they want, regardless of price in the < E1000 range.",1347190507

That's the price you pay.  Or you ignore PCI compliance and risk it.  You probably wouldn't be surprised to learn that this is far more common then people will admit (and I'm not even talking about people in high-risk industries).<p>Anyways, there are a few ways you can do this without having to deal with PCI compliance, though it doesn't solve the problem as well.<p>First, you set up multiple merchant accounts.  That way, for a normal transaction, you might send person A to provider A, and then person B to provider B, and then person C to provider A, so on and so forth.  The goal here is to spread the threat over more than one provider.  You don't just allow PayPal, and if PayPal starts receiving too many transactions, you remove it as an option for a while.<p>If you are limited as you mention to PayPal, Google, and a real payment system, the best way there is to offer encouragement to use one system over another.  Which ever system you want to encourage use of.<p>You can also find a PCI compliant provider who you can then attach merchant accounts to.  They handle the PCI compliance, you provide the merchant accounts.<p>Of course, none of these solutions are really as easy as just using PayPal.  But then you start to see why PayPal is so popular.

The most recent incident that really put me off was a month or two ago when I found what I considered a pretty ideal SO question; ie. a ""how to do X programmatically"". Someone (a relatively new user) had already commented that it was a dupe of another question which it clearly wasn't; several of us simultaneously corrected him, and all seemed fine. Until a few hours later when some drive-by mod arbitrarily closed the question as a dupe; they obviously had enough ninja power to do that off their own bat, but it needed four or five of us to vote to reopen and the last I saw it'd only gotten to two or three. The original questioner seemed fairly demoralised by it; I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't come back.<p>I'm sure there are plenty of other cases of good moderation, but to me it highlights a serious problem with the site. One loose cannon (who I can only assume either was a badly written bot, didn't speak English, or was just trolling) and one overactive mod managed to ruin that question for everyone, and the rest of us had little power to really help.<p>I don't know what the answer to this is; it bears a lot of resemblance to Wikipedia, and they still struggle with it.",1347188424

That's why we are growing much too fast; China and a lot of Asia will be unemployed in the future (Foxconn firing their employees in favor of robots will become common with robot prices falling) (not to mention the move back to to west for several branches/markets, but even without that); most people in country X (not only China) can simply do nothing more than repetitive labor and those will be done in the future. I wouldn't give that 100 years.<p>What 'we' (of the HN crowd) will do post-work is easy; we will make new work. That's not an option for most (I'm not sure if it's 99+% but I guess it is). Happiness in a Federation (Start Trek) utopia is not very hard to imagine for people who have hobbies and passions. With real holodecks it's probably not hard to imagine for people with less ambitions or passions, but that's so incredibly 'not here' yet...",1347188415

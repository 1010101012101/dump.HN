7782493,comment,7777149,7777427,1,0,Shizka,,,"I&#x27;ve found the same as you - pasting code from anywhere to a Python application comes with a risk. This risk is however not too different from other languages where you wouldn&#x27;t want mixed spaces and tabs in your code either. In my opinion, Python just enforces good coding style. You might have been as the error messages I get is rather verbose telling me the linenumber with an exception &quot;IndentationError: unexpected indent&quot; or &quot;IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level&quot;. The first is for wrong identation level and the second is for mixed tabs and spaces.<p>Anyways - to mitigate the risk of misaligned code. The usual thing is that the wrong type of indentation is used. I use sublime text and in that editor there&#x27;s a button where I can convert tabs to spaces and vice versa. The other thing is that of misaligned code with your existing code. You can usually get some plugins that handle this for you. In Python I use the Anaconda-plugin with the &#x27;Auto format&#x27; feature which aligns in accordance to the PEP-8 standard.",1400741983

7782476,comment,7781790,7782405,1,0,vacri,,,"Well, the point he opens with is just him being rude, nothing to do with the limitations of the Glass itself. What&#x27;s he&#x27;s actually asking for in that very first point is a way to view content on Glass without the other person in the conversation realising that you&#x27;re tuning them out. As someone else commented, this is the same as pulling out your smartphone and playing with it instead of conversing.<p>The conspicuousness point is also trueish, but overblown. The sunglass clip-ons do reduce the visibility of the unusual headwear, they just don&#x27;t eliminate it. From experience with our set at work, people out in public react considerably less when the sunglasses are clipped on. It&#x27;s not going to fool someone you&#x27;re in a direct conversation with, but you get fewer odd looks. Obviously this is with one of the subtle charcoal colours, and not the day-glo varieties. I would argue that you shouldn&#x27;t be fooling someone you&#x27;re in a direct conversation with anyway. If you want to do that, there are other tools for single-party recordings.<p>So we&#x27;re down to 4.5 points out of 10. Not accounting for uneven ears, sure. Battery life, sure. Bulk, maybe. Voice recognition? It&#x27;s actually pretty good, for voice recognition. It just doesn&#x27;t have the same capabilities as a human (no tech does, hence my original comment). We got a set straight from the US, it was responding happily to my broad, middle-Australian accent, and it would still recognise a colleague with a very strong French accent who passed by me saying &quot;OK Glass, google porn&quot; (&quot;drive-by&quot; commands are a different problem...), all with no particular calibration done. Voice recognition doesn&#x27;t work with background noise? Even humans have trouble with that.<p>So no, it&#x27;s a bad review all around, for both techies and naifs. It sets expectations for naifs that are impossible to achieve, despite there a few real issues being described. I personally don&#x27;t think Glass is ready for the public yet, but this article offers a lot of misdirection on why.",1400741465

As such, I really don&#x27;t mind if people want to continue thinking it&#x27;s a luck based thing. It just means more profit for me since that perspective, oddly enough, doesn&#x27;t stop people from dropping $$$ in the game, it merely stops them from thinking they can gain an edge by putting in time and effort. Recreational players wouldn&#x27;t play if there wasn&#x27;t a certain amount of luck...<p>EDIT:\nAlso, it&#x27;s important to note that every poker player has to <i>pay for their education.</i> Look at my last graph.

Once I gained some knowledge, and decided to take it much more seriously, my profits skyrocketed.<p>It&#x27;s far better to learn how to play poker at micro/low stakes online, where you will pay less for your poker education, than it is to start with mid/high stakes online or in your local casino.

People will know what to work on by simply working on whatever the highest priority issue is in their queue.<p>This goes against approximately everything I&#x27;ve learned about process in the last 10 years. In fact, I think there&#x27;s literally nothing correct in that whole paragraph. It&#x27;s a perfect caricature of precisely what I think doesn&#x27;t work.<p>* Priorities are complicated. What if a high-priority item is going to take a really long time, compared to other items? Maybe the &quot;product owners&quot; would want it earlier. They won&#x27;t know until you tell them. What if the ticket is actually technically impossible? Establishing priorities requires discussion.<p>* Related: how can you possibly have the product owners establish the milestones without figuring out what it&#x27;s going to take to accomplish? Sometimes milestones have external drivers for functionality or deadline, and sometimes they&#x27;re just checkpoints. But either way, it would be crazy to assume they&#x27;re fixed relative to how long or hard their constituent items are. There are probably a million ways to construct a milestone, but I can&#x27;t think of one that would be useful without a discussion with the developers.<p>* What&#x27;s the correct granularity for a ticket? How would the product owner know how to break that down into specific work items? You need to own your own work queue.<p>* What the hell is a product owner, anyway? I understand there are various stakeholders and people whose job it is to play proxy for those stakeholders, and perhaps you have even formalized a PM role for managing all that. But invariably one of the stakeholders is you. That&#x27;s partially because you&#x27;re involved and presumably have applicable experience building products, but also because as the developer you care about aspects like infrastructure quality, and you need to represent that in the discussion of priorities. In my experience, everything works better with developers involved in the &quot;what are we building?&quot; process, not just getting work thrown over the wall to them.<p>* Why does the product owner, whoever they are, get to assign who works on what? What if I don&#x27;t want to work on that item, or have a good reason why it should be assigned to someone else?<p>* How could this level of detachment from the <i>why</i> of the product ever make you happy?<p>More generally, this manifesto seems built around the idea of <i>minimizing communication</i>. That&#x27;s a really bad idea. Building things is <i>complicated</i> and you need to have a process that&#x27;s willing to face that, not bury its head in the sand and tell everyone to just create and assign tickets. Look, I don&#x27;t disagree that meetings are painful and I&#x27;m always the jerk who wants a crisp, actionable agenda and gets pissy when things drag on.

Thanks for the attention.<p>I&#x27;ve had the site for a little over five years now. I had been working on data models and algorithms for analysis of soccer matches and thought I would have a go at creating a company out of it.  I even applied to YC which was a bit of a laugh in retrospect :)  Right now I have another job that pays the bills but there are a few projects I do on the side, the API being one of them.<p>The API is the latest iteration of my data models exposed to the world as well as my attempt to build as close to a REST API as I could.  I don&#x27;t claim perfection and I&#x27;m sure others will have their opinion on it, which I welcome.<p>I wrote the Python client which is as you say a wrapper over the API, which serves well as a starting point.  If you have ideas on how to extend it, please fork and contribute.<p>There are a few software tools out there that do what you wish.  Statzpack is one, SportyBird is another.  I have my doubts about how big the market really is for this kind of service, but everyone is very early in this space.",1400739267

Patrick Walton helped to answer (45:48):<p>~ The overall discipline hasn&#x27;t been too difficult to been follow.<p>~ Most of the issues we hit are issues in the implementation. (e.g. the precise way the borrow-checker checks inveriants, reasons about lifetimes and whatnot.) These kinds of issues are fixable, and we continue to improve them all the time.<p>~ I don&#x27;t speak for the entire Servo team, but I feel like the discipline, the overall type-system strategy that Rust enforces, has been pretty friendly.<p>~ We still have a lot of unsafe code, but a lot of it is unavoidable, for calling C libraries. And also we&#x27;re doing things like: we have Rust objects which are managed by the SpiderMonkey [JavaScript] garbage collector. Which is really cool that we can do that, but the interface has to be written in the unsafe dialect [of Rust].",1400739109

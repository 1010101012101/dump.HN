IR has many pitfalls, and success in one domain is not an indicator of general applicability. Your algo may work well on the subset of Wikipedia pages. It may spit out garbage with other sources or on search terms that would not occur to you.<p>Just as in crypto, IR algorithms have to be kicked around a lot before they get serious attention. I suggest you put something up that people can play with. You don't have to reveal the algo.",1197752323

Too crazy, too basic?",,"I said earlier in a comment that I am stuck, I can not code for a week now.<p>May be the problem is that having been so long into the forest, I just see the leaves. May be. So let's do something: I tell what I am doing, and you tell me if it is as crazy as it sounds, ok?<p>My software reads a page in normal English, in a couple of seconds, and extract quite some information, facts. It relates the phrases between them, and produces a consolidated group of facts that are saved in a database. Then you can query: What, when, how much, how many, who, whom, whose, where and which. The why is answered only if the explanation is explicit in the text. The first thing I plan to read is obviously the Wikipedia, but there is no scarcity of sources on the Internet.<p>Trust me, at a symbolic level, it works, and it has more than 16.000 synonyms to extend the umbrella. At conceptual level it does not, of course, is soft, no hard AI.<p>Well, that's it. <p>How does it sound to you? Too crazy, too basic?<p>Max",1197749626

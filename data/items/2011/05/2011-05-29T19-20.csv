Google has said all along that the code would be going public again once it's been cleaned up and the phone and tablet versions have been remerged for the next major release.<p>>(or were there some copyright claims involved here? e.g. making a TI-89 emulator should be ok for the market, but you can't include TI's ROM)<p>The comments over on reddit are suggesting that these emulators were based on GPL'd emulators and the developer wasn't complying with the GPL.

2597407,story,,,8,10,alecbenzer,"Ask HN: College Advice",,"tl;dr: incoming cs freshmen at uiuc. Is it worth transferring, what are my chances, I think I might have been able to fair better.<p>I'm an incoming cs freshmen at UIUC. UIUC was a bit of a safety for me (though in hindsight maybe it should've been a safety/target). My feelings about going there are really sort of mixed, for various reasons, and I'm, very idly at this point, considering possibly transferring to a different school.<p>1. Should I even bother? I'm very serious and passionate about going into CS - from what little I've seen of the school so far I'm fond of its overall student community and the CS community - the very fact that there is a noticeable CS community is something that's important to me, and part of why I picked UIUC over my other main option, NYU. Anyway, my point is that there are few schools that beat UIUC in CS anyway. In my mind, the places that are better than it for undergrad cs are MIT, Stanford, probably CMU, and possibly Berkeley - I think UIUC is better or at least on par with any other CS department, and none of the ones close to UIUC have other qualities (eg, being a better overall school) that would make me want to transfer there. So, given that those are my choices, should I bother transferring? I hear MIT and Stanford have very very low transfer accept rates. CMU and Berkeley seemed a bit more promising, but the figure I saw for CMU was overall, not for SCS, and I think I heard somewhere that Berkeley only accepts junior transfers. Are any of those departments better by enough to make it worth disrupting my time at UIUC and readjusting to a new place?<p>I have anecdotal bias against this: my dad had been rejected from Wharton as a high school senior and went to NYU. He was pretty happy there, had pretty good grades, liked the people, but he still wanted to try for Wharton and got in as a transfer. He then hated it at Wharton - it took him 5 years to graduate, his grades were pretty bad, and he couldn't get any jobs. He says he would've been much better off going to NYU, which was at the time pretty far behind Wharton for economics and business, what he was interested in. So I don't want this to happen to me - I don't want to leave somewhere I may be perfectly happy at and doing well in for a ""better"" school where I'll end up doing worse for unforeseen reasons.<p>2. What are my chances, at any of the places I mentioned (MIT, Stanford, CMU, Berkeley)? My junior GPA was a 3.933 - it's probably going to drop a bit from my senior year grades, but hopefully not too much. SAT was a 2270 (super score from 2 tests - 690r, 780m, 800w). If I begin to seriously consider transferring I'd probably retake them and actually study this time. SAT II math2c was an 800, chem was a 680 (I'll probably retake, and study this time). My ECs were okay, not terrific, hopefully I'll have some research or an internship at UIUC to talk about.<p>As far as how I faired this year: my two main choices were MIT and CMU - I got rejected at MIT and waitlisted at CMU (I know some people from this year and last who were about as or possibly less qualified than me who got in to SCS at CMU, but they had applied ED - I applied regular decision). I also applied to Princeton, Columbia, and Cornell kind of randomly (ie, without having shown any kind of interest in them) - got rejected from them. Like I mentioned, I also got in to NYU, and also to Rutgers. I had also applied to UMich and got wait listed, though I'd say that was probably because I applied right on the deadline and also had shown no interest - a friend of mine who did get into UMich (and had applied earlier) got flat out rejected from CMU (while I got wait-listed). I hadn't applied to Berkeley or Stanford. I doubt I would've gotten into Stanford, and relatively optimistic about Berkeley, based on how other people from my school faired.<p>Friends of mine were sort of surprised that I didn't get in to MIT and CMU. A friend of mine who did get into MIT had once told me: ""You're definitely getting into CMU. I'm willing to bet that you will get into every school you applied, with the possible exception of Princeton."" Me: ""And MIT?"" him: ""No - you'll get in. I am 100% sure"". He seemed pretty convinced at times that I was going to keep him out of MIT - ended up working out for him, though. A teacher of ours said to me (in private): ""[MIT] took [him] and not you? Well, maybe they only wanted to take one person from our school"" (which wasn't the case, but anyway). Another friend (the one who got in to CMU), also told me (after I had heard from my schools) that he had been sure I'd get into MIT. I'm mentioning this stuff just to explain why it's sort of in my head that I might want to try to transfer.",1306698922

2597398,comment,2596894,2597296,5,0,ugh,,,"<i>Moreover, it must be confessed that perception and that which depends upon it are inexplicable on mechanical grounds, that is to say, by means of figures and motions. And supposing there were a machine, so constructed as to think, feel, and have perception, it might be conceived as increased in size, while keeping the same proportions, so that one might go into it as into a mill. That being so, we should, on examining its interior, find only parts which work one upon another, and never anything by which to explain a perception.</i><p>That seems like too big of a leap. Why can't ""parts which work one upon another"" not create perception? Is this assumption justified? (I really hope the justification is not ""because mills that perceive are self-evidently absurd"". If it is then my next question is: Why?) If that assumption doesn't stand the rest of the argument falls flat. I would like to hear a bit more about why compound parts can't create perception.<p>The brain certainly looks like it consists of compound parts. We obviously cannot (yet) explain consciousness so it is possible that it is impossible to create consciousness with compound parts, we just don't know. In that light Leibniz's argument seems unconvincing, at least as far as I can understand it.",1306698674

Sure, once evolution discovers intelligence it turns out to be a very efficient way to implement a lot of functionality that would otherwise need to be hard coded, but it's not strictly <i>necessary</i>, and nature did just fine without it for a long time.<p>The good news: that also means that it's unlikely that significant evolutionary pressures went into designing the complex systems responsible for intelligent thought, so they were probably accidentally ""designed"" via random drift.  If you think about that, given the complexity of the algorithms involved, it means that the algorithm space at that level complexity is probably fairly dense with algorithms that function intelligently (where by ""fairly dense"" I mean that it's a lot denser than we might assume otherwise, and the solution that evolution came up with is probably not the only possible one).<p>That means if we ever figure out how to do a guided search through algorithms of the right complexity in the right way, we may yet stand a chance of ""accidentally"" discovering intelligence rather than deliberately designing it.",1306698595

(I'm not sure exactly how accurate it is or what the source is, sorry). Apparently, it is illegal for pilots to read while flying. Even if they are heading in a straight line with no one around for miles. This is because one time an pilot wasn't paying attention and due to a series of software failures, the plane turned into a mountain. Interestingly, the plane was tuning at a very exact amount so that the number of Gs remained constant.<p>In any case, this single crash caused regulation to state that computers can never fly planes by themselves. This strikes me as rather unfair. If a single human crashed a plane, it does not make it illegal for humans to fly planes by themselves.<p>Another example is that in London, subways must be driven by a human. Even though driving a subway may be trivial (there is no way to steer), Londoners apparently do not feel comfortable being driven by a non-living thing. They want to be sure that if they die, the driver dies too, adding a level of accountability.<p>It seems that this sort of wide-spread mistrust of machines is driven more by socially normal paranoia than any kind of logic. I for one am rooting for machines to take over all forms of driving. There may be a few mishaps, but it will probably become hundreds of times safer eventually.",1306698104

I'm sure some ""well-meaning"" legislator will make it his or her priority to ensure that speed limits are never exceeded. However, at least in Massachusetts, if you go on the highway, everyone (including police) drive at ~75 MPH even though the posted speed limit is 55 or 65 MPH. Few will buy a car with this kind of handicap, were it to exist -- and I worry that it will. Many speed limits in the US were imposed decades ago, with less safe and responsive cars -- it would be a pity if potentially revolutionary technology advances were thwarted by this fact.<p>Legislation has already crippled or made useless many useful automotive innovations. In the US, technologies that allow for adaptive cruise control (maintaining a distance to the car in front of you) can only decelerate the car, and not accelerate the car. This forces the driver to have to constantly accelerate, greatly reducing the effectiveness of this feature. Many computer-laden vehicles with navigation systems are similarly crippled -- they automatically ""lock"" when the car is in motion, and some (like in Lexus vehicles) cannot even be overridden by people sitting in the passenger seat... often causing unintended risks like drivers pulling over on busy highways just to readjust their GPS target.",1306697646

At some point it will be cheap enough that the additional cost will pale in comparison to the lives that will be saved as well as the simple convenience of being able to do something else while commuting somewhere.<p>Likewise I see this kind of thing replacing many forms of public transportation. There will simply be a fleet of cars. You'll say where you want to go and some system will route people and cars to destinations.<p>But, the transition won't be quick or easy. You need look no further than the aviation industry to see why.<p>Basically, automation in modern aircraft is a double-edged sword. It seems to erode the ability of pilots to actually fly [1], software errors causing deaths [2] and (I can't find the link to this) I also read a study that in more automated planes, pilots are more likely to believe erroneous instruments rather than their own senses and experience.<p>The issue won't be how the car normally behaves because as demonstrations have shown, current systems require very little human intervention.<p>The issue will be extraordinary circumstances plus the huge liability problem of any errors.<p>Example: if someone runs a red light and causes a crash, killing someone, that person is responsible. If an automated car does the same thing, the manufacturer will be responsible.<p>That alone will impede adoption.<p>Instead I think you'll have what we already have: slowly adding automation to cars. Cars already have radars and can stop themselves from colliding, they can park themselves and so on.<p>But at some point the driver will need to go away and that will be a tremendously challenging leap forward for society.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.tourismandaviation.com/news-4530--Pilot_Reliance_on_Automation_Erodes_Skills_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tourismandaviation.com/news-4530--Pilot_Reliance_...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/8.77.html#subj6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/8.77.html#subj6</a>",1306696382

The quote about shareholder value being a dumb idea from Jack Welch, yeah, sure.<p>This article is sloppy though.

I don&#x27;t see how it makes sense.<p>Let&#x27;s fast-forward a few decades. If we have combat robots (not that I&#x27;m advocating this, but I think that&#x27;s where we&#x27;ll end up) then brain-wise one soldier can know everything that another can. I.e. there&#x27;s no need for different MOS. You can have one brain that is both a special-operations infantry assaulter, and knows how to service any aircraft in your arsenal. The real differentiator would be morphology of the units.<p>So, if every unit could conceivably be trained in all tactics and doctrine, what&#x27;s the point of services vs. just specialities?",1417888640

To use an arbitrary time period (who is to say IBM’s returns 10 years from now won’t trounce JnJ’s), and employ a metric (shareholder returns) that is often out of whack with reality (as Montier himself would acknowledge) isn’t persuasive enough for me.<p>The second macro example of comparing returns between two totally different time periods also isn&#x27;t exactly apples to apples either. And also completely ignores the effects of hundreds of other potentially significant factors (interest rates, gdp levels, global trade etc)<p>This article seems to be a strong case of confirmation bias on his part. Ironical given that he&#x27;s written a popular book on behavioral investing.

Its shelf-life has been extended by virtue of it being used in practice against adversaries with unsophisticated weaponry. This makes it immediately useful in practice but the military is well-aware that it would not be nearly as successful against a more sophisticated adversary and this is why they have been angling for an alternative.<p>It is a relic of the Cold War not just in its history but, unfortunately, also in its defenses and weaponry with no obvious upgrade path.

As I said, the actual situation is something we might reasonably have guessed: combining building blocks quickly and cheaply is perceived as more important than quality. Given that it&#x27;s clear a lot of people will pay for cheap junk, that is a commercially sensible thing to produce.<p>I just find it sad that this is the situation we seem to have drifted into. As more and more things we use every day depend fundamentally on software, and an ever more connected society makes issues like security and scalability more important as well, I think the world would be a much better place if consumers were less forgiving of problems caused by badly written software and demanded better. However, the industry seems to have succeeded in convincing most people that mediocrity is inevitable and software that only works for a brief period or requires constant updates for maintenance is the norm.<p>What is perhaps more sad is that so many professional software developers themselves don&#x27;t seem to know any better.<p>For example, part of this study examined attitudes to static typing and unit testing. We might reasonably suspect that a population interested in SaaS has a bias towards dynamic languages like Ruby and Python, so it&#x27;s not too surprisingly that 62% said they saw the value of unit testing compared to only 36% for static typing. The disturbing thing is that <i>both</i> of these figures are so low, given that these aren&#x27;t exactly controversial techniques and there is plenty of evidence that using at least one of them can substantially improve quality.<p>Another telling contrast was that when asked about what they enjoyed using, programmers heavily favoured expressive languages, yet when asked about which language features were important, features that offer more expressive power like templates, generators, higher order functions and macros were all rated much lower than OOP staples like classes/interfaces and inheritance. A majority saw little if any connection between higher order functions and objects, despite their mathematically provable relationship; a third didn&#x27;t even understand the question.<p>When you have that level of ignorance of programming theory that really ought to be general knowledge by professional standards, it&#x27;s not really about letting developers have what they want while also giving them what anyone else thinks they should have. They could already have both today, and they already say they want the benefits that would bring. They just don&#x27;t know enough about the tools that are already available to them to get those results, and isn&#x27;t that just a straightforward education problem?",1417887229

He&#x27;s worth reading much more about --<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)#Aerial_Attack_Study"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Boyd-The-Fighter-Pilot-Changed-ebook/dp/B000FA5UEG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Boyd-The-Fighter-Pilot-Changed-ebook/d...</a><p>He&#x27;s often credited with his later-life grand strategy, but his Aerial Attack Study in the early 1960&#x27;s is actually more impressive to me. He developed a working mathematical model of how fighters (and other aircraft) can gain or lose speed, velocity, turning, etc at different speeds/altitudes/etc based on their specs.<p>A lot of &quot;sexy-looking&quot; fighters performed pretty poorly, and the Air Force command were aghast at many aspects of the study.<p>At the time, the &quot;state of the art&quot; was building multi-purpose aircraft that could do reconnaissance, establish air superiority (dogfighting), bomb enemy targets, etc. But these multi-purpose aircraft didn&#x27;t excel on any parameter: they weren&#x27;t large enough to carry the fuel and payload to be exceptional bombers, and they weren&#x27;t fast and light enough to out-dogfight the leading Soviet aircraft.<p>The book on Boyd I linked talks about the back-and-forth nature of defense contracting and the armed forces in that era, which was a problem. Likewise, it describes the various jockeying for power and budget between the various branches of the armed services: Navy, Air Force, and Army all had aircraft and certain missions assigned to them, and fought to preserve and expand their territory.<p>Close Air Support (CAS) is a mission the Air Force was never so crazy about and was somewhat de-prioritizing compared to air superiority and strategic bombing missions... yet, at the same time, they didn&#x27;t want to lose the mission to the Army for political reasons.<p>Meanwhile, Boyd and the people he worked with, notably aircraft designer Pierre Sprey who led the A-10&#x27;s build -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Sprey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Sprey</a> -- they didn&#x27;t see their roles as just related to being a technician or soldier, but were very deep historians and scientists.<p>They noted that a lot of Nazi Germany&#x27;s early success was the mix of maneuver warfare <i>mixed with close-air support from Stuka Bombers.</i> The Nazi advantage was erased when the Western Allies eventually achieved air superiority, but Luftwaffe CAS was absolutely devastating in the early stages of WWII.<p>Sprey, Boyd, and the rest built around the theory of CAS and seeing the potential of it for turning a ground war, and then sat to work out an aircraft that was about as un-sexy as it gets, but was incredibly safe for the pilot, could stay involved in the battle for a very long time, and could have devastating impact on enemy ground forces.<p>The A-10 thus isn&#x27;t flashy, can&#x27;t do multi-mission roles (at the time, it was the only <i>pure</i> CAS airplane in the U.S. armed forces; it only did close air support and nothing else), it&#x27;s not particularly fast, it doesn&#x27;t look good at an air show, it&#x27;s not particularly prestigious.<p>It is, however, devastatingly effective as a tank killer, artillery killer, convoy killer. Rather effective against infantry too.<p>The lessons from Boyd, aircraft design, etc, are probably worth reading for anyone who deals with technology or organizational development, since they seem timeless -- eventually prestige and politics come to dominate true mission, and how do you navigate around that?<p>The book &quot;Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the World&quot; is worth reading; so are the remnants of various briefings Boyd and colleagues gave with commentary. A useful insight into lots of things, not the least of them how to actually get things done with ingenuity and how to really be service-oriented in a world that often doesn&#x27;t reward that.

While classification involves numerous factors, I personally don&#x27;t see how any of this passes even one of the most fundamental, the &quot;nature and degree of control by the employer&quot; test.<p>Other on-demand companies that use independent contractor classification are facing class action lawsuits [2][3] over classification and given the general trends in the courts[4], there&#x27;s little doubt we will continue to see the number of class actions alleging misclassification grow.<p>Putting aside the costs of defending and settling a class action, or paying damages in an adverse ruling, the real question for investors in any on-demand company that currently relies on independent contractor classification is what employee classification would do to the economics of the business. Think of this as an &quot;employee stress test.&quot;<p>In some cases, on-demand companies are using independent contract classification to shift costs that have traditionally been borne by competitors in their markets, giving them an &quot;unfair&quot; pricing advantage. If they are found to be misclassifying their workers, their ability to compete on price will be affected.<p>In other cases, companies charge a premium for a service that offers convenience. If they are found to be misclassifying their workers and are forced to pay their workers as employees, the premium charged to consumers would either have to increase or the company would need to be able to live on reduced margins.<p>The effects of reclassification would be particularly significant for transportation companies. For example, in California, under Labor Code Section 2802, employers are on the hook for expenditures or losses incurred by their employees &quot;in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties, or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer.&quot; This includes expenditures related to travel/mileage.<p>It&#x27;s going to be very interesting in the coming years to see which of these on-demand companies continue to thrive because I personally think it&#x27;s inevitable that many of them are going to be forced to reclassify their workers as employees. I suspect some investors aren&#x27;t giving this enough consideration in their due diligence.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.morningstar.com/all/market-watch/TDJNMW2014110765/update-delivery-startups-echo-dot-com-boom-and-bust.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.morningstar.com/all/market-watch/TDJNMW201411076...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://uberlawsuit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uberlawsuit.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Handy-com-housecleaners-lawsuit-could-rock-5891672.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Handy-com-housecleane...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-16/fedex-ground-says-its-drivers-arent-employees-dot-the-courts-will-decide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-16/fedex-ground...</a>",1417887003

For the last couple hundred years they&#x27;ve been reliably producing scotch, with their most common version aged 12 years. They&#x27;ve got solid people, many of whom spend their whole careers there. They have a very well-regarded brand; sales and profits are solid and consistent.<p>A corporate raider buys them. They immediately stop putting new whiskey in barrels, fire anybody who has been there more than a few years, and start selling off property and distilling gear. This frees up a lot of cash, making quarterly results look great. They then increase sales volume 3x by buying inferior whiskeys and selling it under their brand while increasing marketing. Quarterly numbers look even better.  The raiders load the company up with debt, extracting cash, then take the company public. There is some grumbling from whiskey aficionados that it&#x27;s &quot;not the same&quot;, but the public, looking at the strong numbers and the beloved brand name, eagerly buys the stock.<p>A few years later, as the aging whiskey runs out and the lowered quality harms the brand, sales fall. Interest rates go up, making the debt hard to manage. The house of cards comes tumbling down and the company declares bankruptcy. People mourn the loss of a once-great distillery, many good people are out of jobs, and a lot of stockholders take a loss on their tax forms. The raider uses its now-larger cache hoard to repeat the process elsewhere.<p>An outcome like that is within the current rules of business, and is depressingly common. But it&#x27;s not why we as a society provide for and support the whole notion of companies. Sure, sometimes takeover defenses are management getting comfortable. But &quot;management operates the company for the benefit of the owners&quot; is an ideological statement, not a descriptive one.",1417886228

Another big contributor to messaging is in the message size.  One can claim 10M messages/sec but for 1 byte messages, 10m messages/s is hardly impressive.<p>I can say that on today&#x27;s hardware, achieving 3-7M msgs/sec in a single-stream, guaranteed, in-order messaging is possible.  This us also with 120 byte messages, which amounts to about 3-7Gbps if sustained messaging in clusters of 2 to 200+ machines. What do you need to achieve this?<p>* Kernel bypass network architecture e.g. Solarflare 10/40gbe<p>* 10gbe switches<p>* decoupling of transport layer into a dedicated processor cores<p>* busy-polling processes<p>* business logic placed on dedicated cores.<p>* use of shared memory and/or memory mapping to transport messaging between processes.<p>It all sounds fairly convoluted to throw up processes and burn a core on rx/tx, but if you need to process millions of messages a second at fairly low latency, this is about the limit of where it goes.  Using traditional application and socket tied to a single process will get you to around 1 million messages/sec with some very large buffers and efficient business logic, but thst eill be about it.

Here&#x27;s some answers hopefully can help clarify things a bit.<p>* Are messages delivered once and only once?<p>A: MQTT allows QoS 0 (at most once), 1 (at least once), and 2 (exactly once.) The performance numbers in the blog are for QoS 0.<p>However, SurgeMQ implements all three and there&#x27;s unit tests for all three. I just haven&#x27;t done the performance tests for QoS 1 and 2.<p>* Are messages are messages delivered at least once?<p>SurgeMQ supports it though the numbers posted are for QoS 0 (at most once)<p>* Can messages be dropped entirely under pressure? (aka best effort)<p>No. Currently no messages are dropped.<p>* If they drop under pressure, how is pressure measured? Is there a back-pressure mechanism?<p>See above.<p>* Can consumers and producers look into the queue, or is it totally opaque?<p>Not sure what this means..sorry..<p>* Is queueing unordered, FIFO or prioritised?<p>Ordered, FIFO...MQTT spec requires that messages from publishers to delivered in the same order to the subscribers.<p>* Is there a broker or no broker?<p>Brokered<p>* Does the broker own independent, named queues (topics, routes etc) or do producers and consumers need to coordinate their connections?<p>Brokers uses topics to route. Publisher publishes to a topic, subscribers subscribe to multiple topics w/ optional wild cards.<p>* Is queueing durable or ephemeral?<p>Ephemeral currently. Though MQTT spec requires that any unack&#x27;ed QoS 1 and 2 messages be redelivered when the server restarts or client reconnects. So once SurgeMQ meets that spec, it could be considered somewhat durable.<p>* Is durability achieved by writing every message to disk first, or by replicating messages across servers?<p>N/A<p>* Is queueing partially/totally consistent across a group of servers or divided up for maximal throughput?<p>Currently SurgeMQ is a single server w/ no clustering ability. However, MQTT spec does mention the bridge capability that is a poor man&#x27;s cluster. Not yet implemented.<p>* Is message posting transactional?<p>QoS 1 and 2 starts to be more transactional. QoS 0 is strictly fire and forget.<p>* Is message receiving transactional?<p>See above.<p>* Do consumers block on receive or can they check for new messages?<p>Block on receive.<p>* Do producers block on send or can they check for queue fullness?<p>Block on send.",1417885236

I&#x27;m working at a distributed queue and those are exactly the set of questions I ask myself when building different parts of the system, but your exposition is something I&#x27;m going to cut&paste and read every time I&#x27;m going to work to my project. Btw, we both work at Pivotal :-) Just a question: &quot;Is queueing partially/totally consistent across a group of servers or divided up for maximal throughput&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure I understand this fully, could you please extend that a bit with some more context? Thanks.",1417885229

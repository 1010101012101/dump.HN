I'm all for keeping it simple and functional, but a little aesthetic snazz can contribute to the end goal.<p>I couldn't find the 'Reply' link for a moment -- and I'm not even THAT blind. ;) Looking forward to that update!",1172227606

654,comment,638,638,0,0,jwecker,,,"I agree with the post.  When an idea is new there is a tendency to feel like it needs protecting.  If you're serious about it, though, and get your hands dirty with the details of implementing whatever it is, NDA's seem more and more silly.  By the time you get a real good idea working you won't care if the whole world knows.  You know that as simple as the idea sounded, it's really thousands of hours of blood sweat dollars and tears.  You'll say- &#34;oh, you want to do it also?  go right ahead and try.&#34;",1172226229

652,comment,278,483,0,0,Harj,,,"I think that's the point Allen is trying to make - if you're trying to build a sustainable company in its own right i.e. not looking to have Google acquire it, then it takes time.  For example take Facebook - they have possibly the most viral product ever seen on the web and after two years they still don't know what their killer revenue stream is and neither have they IPO'ed.  This stuff takes time!",1172226038

Successful single founders is necessary to encompass a lot more characteristics. It's difficult enough to find 2 motivated people to take risk starting up, finding 2-in-1 it will be a lot harder. But if they try to avoid it, althout they don't exclude it, it doesn't mean it can happen at YC, or someone on his/her own.

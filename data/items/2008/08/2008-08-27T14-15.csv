So quickly, that I doubt I was conscious of placing each individual finger.<p>I wonder if mouse + keyboard input could be augmented by head gestures?  NaturalPoint sells an economic mouse that can be operated by placing a reflective dot on a pair of glasses or a hat.  What if instead of being a mouse, this could be an entirely alternate input device?  You could read head gestures in the same way that the Wiimote detects different movements.  These gestures would likely become ""muscle memory.""",1219848556

288073,comment,287851,287851,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The problem with this ""inviolable rule"" is that it's circular:<p><i>if you have a legal question, you should ask a lawyer, and only a lawyer</i><p>I agree, but what is a ""legal question""? Only lawyers are qualified to answer that!<p>Many of those who pose legal questions to the web, rather than to a lawyer, do so because <i>they don't recognize</i> that their question crosses the boundary where they need a lawyer. It's not as if such edge cases are particularly rare, nor are they easy to resolve. Every post that I make to news.YC is a potential libel action; every quote that I cut and paste could be the subject of a copyright suit. (Just ask the folks who post about Scientology... and note that I just substantially increased my legal risk, and YCs, by using the word 'Scientology' in this context. Perhaps my lawyer would have suggested a different example...)<p>Everyone who writes software tiptoes around legal issues of patent and copyright. Should I consult lawyers every time I use Pastie?<p>Everyone who downloads a piece of software risks a lawsuit. Click a link that installs Firefox: legal. Click a link that installs a P2P client? Depends on what you do with it. What about HD-DVD ripping software? If I install it, am I committing a crime?<p>Yes, the ultimate arbiter of all of these issues should be a lawyer. I'm certainly not qualified. But we can't afford to pay lawyers every single day. In the end, we all have to develop our own sense of when we need professional legal advice and when we don't -- and the web is helpful for that, even though any individual anecdote (even the ones told by <i>bona fide</i> lawyers!) may be unreliable or inapplicable to your individual situation.",1219848400

At first you do have to do a lot of remembering of commands, but after a while  you don't really think about the commands you are typing.<p>It's kind of like playing the piano.  If you learn a song and practice it enough times, you probably don't remember every chord or note, but your hands play the whole song kind of like if your hands have a mind of their own.  When a musician is asked something like what the chord progression of a song is, or what the notes to the melody are, usually he sits down at the instrument and plays it out with his hands first, triggering his memory.<p>So I think it mostly boils down to practice, rather than memory.

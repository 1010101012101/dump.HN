I run some other reasonably successful sites in the developer space and Adsense is basically a no-go - results as bad as you've mentioned.<p>If I were in your shoes, I'd dabble with some affiliate programs. I've already been doing this and having success on my developer focused sites. Only high quality stuff but latest books, e-books, courses, events, etc. I notice you have Carbon on there and if I recall correctly, they approached me and the CPM was laughably bad (though this may have changed..), I want/need to be making $5-10 CPM overall from display advertising.",1306277963

To go against them in this way is like sending amateurs out to do a job for which they are highly likely to be overmatched. I thought this piece was thought-provoking and that is why I posted it - but, I am skeptical about an approach like this working, at least when the players are small, independent businesses who have nothing in common with one another besides a desire to resist the threats of the troll.

Which means you dont have to worry about triggering a destructive action by accidentally brushing the screen somewhere and grip-placement is a lot less restrictive, i.e. if it's most comfortable to hold by a corner of the actual screen, you can. The physical buttons mean that I know for sure when I've made an input.<p>Not only that, but part of what made the iPhone's touch screen so much better than all the touch screen interfaces that came before it was it's insistence on a 1:1 direct manipulation paradigm, which simply isn't possible with current e-ink technology. This is more like a touch screen gesture based interface, which simply isn't that much better or more satisfying and is in some ways worse than physical buttons.<p>I find that the non-touch screen makes for a remarkably relaxed experience, but I'm afraid it's probably not enough of a concern for device makers to resist the whizz-banginess of the touch screen.",1306277574

It only takes one complete horror story to drive a lot of patients away, and the person telling the horror story may not necessarily know what he's talking about.<p>At least when I read hotel reviews on tripadvisor I know enough to tell when the one-star reviews are based on real complaints (""Cockroaches all over the room"") or excessively picky customers (""Desk clerk rolled his eyes the third time I requested to be shifted to a room with a better view"").<p>But if I read ""Doctor Smith botched my surgery, and I lost both my legs"" I'm at a loss. Did Doctor Smith really botch the surgery? Or did Doctor Smith's heroic and brilliant surgical intervention <i>just</i> manage save the life of a patient who otherwise would have died? I don't know, and the patient really doesn't know either.<p>If I knew more about medicine I'd probably have a more realistic example than that, but the fact is that some patients always wind up with outcomes from their medical treatment which are worse than they expected, and they're usually pretty ignorant about to what extent the blame lies with ""crappy doctor"" vs ""crappy luck"".",1306277426

Which covers the 'you pay it now with a credit card and you pay it off when the CC bill arrives' scenario.<p>Back in the 80's when I was trying to buy a house, part of the down payment was going to be funded by the sale of stock (I had worked for Intel and had vested a few shares). How <i>much</i> of the down payment was flipping all over the map as Intel's price went up and down and up and down. On the one hand I wanted to hold it as long as possible (the trend was upward) but I didn't want to get caught in a dip either. My wife and I picked a number we felt was ""reasonable"" and put that in as a 'limit' order. When that fired, we picked the best choice of the three houses we had as candidates and made an offer on the house.<p>The stock was up an additional 5% by the time we closed but had been down at least 5% between the sale and the close. Very stressful if we had been under contract and the price was falling.<p>Flash forward to the dot-com days, a good friend bought a house beyond their means and was making payments by selling stock.

Removing these dependencies makes it mostly work in Safari (the 404 example, for example, renders fine when using fallbacks to the standard JavaScript arrays).<p>My big problem with the state of web programming at the moment is that people are generating these examples which, despite being based on ""standards"", are virtually worthless to anyone much outside of nightly build users. Some of these ""standards"" (i.e. WebSockets) are so ill-concived that they get rolled into one browser release, before being rolled out of the next when found to be flawed. These things are not ""standards"" - they're browser makers playing around with ideas. Similarly, this example (whilst cool) is <i>not</i> CSS3 - it's CSS 3 plus selection of other supra-bleeding edge stuff that wasn't needed to demonstrate the issue.<p>Whilst I generally applaud using cutting edge technologies, the entire point of the web (to me) is interoperability.

It's a custom delivery platform for content that happens to piggy-back on HTML, draped in a guise respectability via rushed out and hacked together concepts that many will never implement (as by the time someone's finally got around to doing it, they're onto v(X + 3) of the ""standard"").<p>Sigh, I sound about 30 years older than I am. However, having been involved in real standardisation where we strive to create something stable and reusable, these types of examples make HTML 5 look a melange of disparate and barely interoperable concepts.

2581927,comment,2580383,2580383,12,0,akeefer,,,"Where all these grand proposals break down is when you actually have to deal with real, domain-specific problems.  It's not too hard to clearly express what the split_string() function or the multiply() function do, so namespace collisions aren't a problem.  But what about the function that ""assigns"" an ""activity"" to a ""user?""  All of a sudden, every single person is going to mean something different by those three words, and it suddenly requires a huge amount of context to find that function.  Searching for something that assigns activities to users as some sort of global search is worthless; the only stuff you care about is the set of functions within your code base that deal with those concepts, or perhaps within some library that you understand and whose notions of users, activities, and assignment matches what you need to do.  So you need some unit to pull in that's larger than just a bag of functions; you need a group of functions that collectively operate on the same sets of data in consistent ways.  And that's just a fundamentally hard problem; finding the right split so that you have a set of functions that can be used together, that are reusable, that don't rely on or expose additional concepts or libraries, that's all very difficult.  Just flattening the function namespace, killing modules, and doing global searches doesn't do anything for that problem.  Again, as much as we all wish that the proper unit of reusability in programming is a single function, since it makes life easier, in most complicated cases that's simply not the case.  That's why we have classes, or modules, or namespaces, or packages in the first place:  they're all various attempts to group together functions that work together on the same kinds of data, that share the same understanding of that data and that work towards the same goal.  Just punting on that encapsulation problem doesn't make it go away.",1306275835

Langner studied psychology and artificial intelligence at the Free University of Berlin. He fell into control systems by accident and found that he loved the fiendishly painstaking work. Every control system is like a bespoke suit made from one-of-a-kind custom fabrictailored precisely for the conditions of that industrial installation and no other. In a profession whose members have a reputation for being unable to wear matching socks, Langner is a bona fide dandy. My preference is for Dolce & Gabbana shoes, he says. Did you notice, yesterday I wore ostrich? Langner loves the attention that his theories have gotten. He is waiting, he says, for an American chick, preferably a blonde, and preferably from California, to notice his blog and ask him out.</i><p>This looks bad in isolation. But the piece is enormous; more than 60 grafs long. Langner's complaint makes it sound like a hit piece. It's not; it's simply using those (apparently misleading) details to add some color. The article is ostensibly not even about Langner, even though it quotes and discusses him warmly throughout.<p>I don't want to sound like I'm defending bad reporting, but the VF articles has <i>substantive</i> concerns about Langner as well --- for instance, his prevalence as a authoritative source for lots of other journalism about Stuxnet --- and one way to dodge that is to redirect attention to stupid stuff like what kinds of shoes he <i>really</i> prefers.",1306275612

With communication out Iraqi units that were, on paper, 'stronger' than the coalition forces deployed against them in parts of the battlefield surrendering, in part because they weren't aware of supporting units nearby.<p>Finally Egypt, Libya, and Yemen are good examples of communication infrastructure favoring a disperse group in their efforts to overthrow an established presence.<p>It is no surprise that folks who have used communications superiority as an advantage against their adversaries are keenly aware of the disadvantage of <i>not</i> having the communication 'high ground.' Those folks will work tirelessly both in the open and underground to give themselves the advantage.",1306274538

Variable name length is mainly related to two things:<p>* Scope the variable resides over<p>* Generality of the variable<p>If the scope is large (the variable is global and exposed to a lot of code), the variable name has to be longer, so that far away readers can make sense of it. A variable that scopes over 2 lines is allowed to be much shorter, especially if its definition is as clear or clearer than an arbitrary name.<p>As for the generality, if you write a function addEmployeeSalaries, of course that is a better name than some arbitrary short name (e.g: ""addEm"").<p>But when writing (very very) general code, it is hard to avoid situations where the variable denotes only structure. It is just too general to find a useful long (and specific) name.<p>For example, consider:<p><pre><code>    flip f x y = f y x\n    \n    sequence :: Monad m => [m a] -> m [a]\n</code></pre>\nSingle-letter variable (and type variable) names, but considered perfectly good practice.",1306274507

As we dug into the story, we began to wonder if Medical Justice was taking advantage of medical professionals' lack of sophistication about the law. Doctors and dentists are understandably worried about damage to their reputations from negative reviews, and medical privacy laws do make it tricky for them to respond when their work is unfairly maligned. Although Dr. Cirka declined repeated requests for an interview, his emailed statements (and the statements of his staff) suggest he doesn't understand the terms of the agreement he asks his patients to sign.""<p>Doctors aren't lawyers.  Most just want to stay in business and do their job without getting sued.  That's where organizations like Medical Justice come in.   Attacking the individual Doctors on an issue like this does no good.  Because they weren't the people who thought up the chain of logic that led to the creation of this form.  So they can't argue the pros and cons of its existence.  Meaning they might agree with every counter point you present but still stick with the agreement because they are ""trusting experts""<p>If Ars or anyone else wants to really make a difference in this arena they need to engage those ""experts"" and take the accusations to that organization (they clearly tried to do this, my issue is with their attack on the doctor)<p>The problem with the author calling-out an individual doctor is it makes a case for the agreement.  By singling out one doctor and attacking him for an industry practice it says ""patients can be irrational online"" which will make doctors fear the online world more (and hence give more credence to organizations that claim the best way to deal with patients is to censor them)",1306274468

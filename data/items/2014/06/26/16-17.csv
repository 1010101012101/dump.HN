The point of inheritance taxes is not to prevent you passing it on, it is to prevent the building of family empires which tend to screw people (in addition to being another revenue source). But why? The ONLY purpose of government is actually to preserve order by preventing people from being assholes to each other. Turns out people tend to do that if nobody keeps them in check. Now the rich kinda think the purpose is to keep people from doing anything to THEM, but even that still concedes my stated purpose for government. Large accumulations of wealth can be both good or bad, but from where I sit it looks like the super-rich aren&#x27;t even sure what to do with all their money, so why not? Estate-tax is just another knob to turn in the preservation of society. The only real question is how far to turn it. I&#x27;m open to debate from all sides on that issue.",1403801843

They invariably start with small things (~ “evaluating Plot[…] in one cell”). Then they join communities, accept certain practices and fashions, and pick the tools that dominate the community.<p>Workbench (Eclipse + Mathematica Kernel caller + some build tools) is a universally recommended solution for large programs written in Mathematica. Having no experience with programming, I honestly tried it, used for several months only to come to believe people only recommend it because of fashions and traditions currently dominating the area. There was <i>absolutely no benefit</i> in using it for a [relatively] large project instead of a bunch of notebooks with their cells properly and consistently (and automatically, of course) tagged. I deploy, call unit tests and show project directory tree, with one-word command for each task, it all happens inside FontEnd, and I have no idea why people repeatedly try to float away from notebook interface.<p>I don&#x27;t have years of experience, and may be stupid, but I strongly suspect it&#x27;s only due to old habits, community influence or plain unwillingness to innovate when you have traditional environments at hand.<p>Multi-language projects could present a challenge, though (given that we have to represent text with boxes and not pure strings), but it can be overcome as well, if only people invested their time and effort.",1403801399

Your mentioned table is targeted at a little bit different audience, as you already pointed out TableAir appeals more to users with good taste in aesthetics. Also another very important aspect of TableAir is that once paired with a smartphone true potential of TableAir is unveiled. One of the biggest obstacles when starting using standing table is what we call a hard switch. People start working standing 24/7 - sore legs and back are unavoidable. We believe it shouldn&#x27;t be the case. The most sustainable way of changing work habits is to transform them step by step, so what the app does it suggests you when it&#x27;s time to change a posture and little by little increases standing intervals until you reach your desired goal.<p>And as for pranksters it&#x27;s prankster-proof :) the only way to connect to the table is via our app which utilizes secure bluetooth connection. Also every table has its own custom id and encrypted password, I mean everything is possible and with enough determination one can hack into most secure servers but I can honestly say that table is secure from domestic hacking.<p>And lastly about the lock of the height. The construction of our motors is made in such a way that once the desired height is reached it simply locks itself, meaning that if you wanna lower it again you have to use an app or the smart button - it&#x27;s physically impossible to push it downwards, well unless you&#x27;re hulk or something...<p>Anyway MadMoogle you touched some interesting points, thanks for checking out TableAir and you never know maybe one day we&#x27;ll create something more suitable for you as well.",1403799294

Once I got better at that, we&#x27;d either increase the speed or add &quot;distractions&quot; like having &quot;dog&quot; written on black and white checkered boxes.<p>But more related to what you&#x27;re saying, there are actually therapy systems that use multiple displays to simulate things like walking through a grocery store. Some people after a concussion can&#x27;t even go through a grocery store because all the stimulus of different boxes plus movement overwhelms them. An even simpler thing I did was simply to watch youtube videos of people walking through areas with a shaky camera or a dashboard camera from a car driving at night (dealing with other cars&#x27; lights).

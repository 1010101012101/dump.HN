Trying to support everyone right away is just like premature optimization. Get something out first, then work to support exceptions if you see that you actually have users that would want that.",1211698280

Learning college level material isn't some mystical magical thing that you need the professor who holds the keys to teach you!  Unless they are the only repository of information and no textbook exists to learn the material.  Once you start understanding the vocab (and stop wasting your time by not reading the best books for your topic) it's just like anything else.  Hopefully you can find a professor/writer who isn't horrible at writing and learned less is more.  If not, you'll figure it out.",1211698253

199403,comment,199279,199320,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>race and intelligence?</i><p>I don't think this subject comes up very often with small children. ""Discrimination"" is just a probabilistic decision made wherever imperfect knowledge exists. That is, you look at the demographics of a neighborhood before moving there, knowing full well that it's not an ideal measure. Again, what can children do about such a thing?<p>The OP seemed to be setting up a scenario in which his parents said, ""...and others disagree"" and so made themselves seem ""truthful"". That's halfway to getting to the real truth which is, ""We ourselves are completely without a clue, but prefer Yahweh over Ganesh because an elephant head is bullcrap a mite too obvious for our tastes. Others disagree.""<p>The real secret is that truth doesn't matter too much unless it involves something that can damage you. God, it just so happens, is not among the things that can damage you. And so, feel free to believe whatever you want.",1211698173

199401,comment,198732,199363,0,0,xlnt,,,"As you must be aware, many smart people disagree with you about Rand, and can back it up with something better than a youtube video. And anyway, you said her philosophy contains certain flaws. That doesn't imply it's not valuable and useful overall, so even if I concede your points, it's not very important. The reasons I like Rand have nothing to do with ""axiom of reflexivity of identity"" or that other stuff you said.<p>edit: no online sources? I don't normally pay $35+ because a hostile, anonymous internet commenter said something would refute someone I respect but didn't want to explain the ideas himself.",1211698142

199398,comment,198732,199201,0,0,stcredzero,,,"The language syntax may be the same, but programming approaches might be very different.  I've seen parts of a Smalltalk program where it was coded like spaghetti copy-paste Fortran, and it's actually hopeless to try and fully understand the semantics and still meet your deadline.  But I was able to use a few tricks to prove that certain modifications wouldn't alter other functionality so I could get my work done.  In the same program, there was well factored code with a nice object model, where it would behoove you to understand the part you're working on in a more conventional way.<p>On reflection, I think you may be right that good code is good code.  Size of the system matters most when the code is bad.",1211697554
199397,comment,198588,199234,0,0,mattj,,,"Problem - 1 false negative or 1 false positive isn't usually a problem. Generally, if you have this many interviews you have some sort of voting system. Let's say it's consensus - then 1 false negative will disqualify some good people, but you'd need 14 false positives, you have a (0.1)^14 chance of hiring a bad person. Expected number of interviews in which you would see this happen once? 10^14<p>But, you may ask, what about the case where they should be rejected, 8-6 (assuming majority voting not consensus, but you could apply this to any voting threshold), and you have two false positives and 0 false negatives, is it really that horrible that you might experience the borderline case where you hire someone who might be mediocre, assuming everyone else is pretty good?<p>Yeah, there is a good chance you'll makes some individual mistakes. But having lots of interviews decreases the probability of making those mistakes frequently enough to actually influence the outcome.<p>Hate to say it, but your ""mathematical justification"" is really just another example of geek chest-thumping.",1211697432

This discovery can help people cope with jet lag or adjust to working late shifts.  Scientists have long known that our circadian rhythm is regulated by our exposure to light.

199393,comment,198797,199373,0,0,rory096,,,"I don't see that as true- even tech savvy people seem to do it. I think it might have something to do with email sometimes being seen as a more formal type of online communication, as opposed to instant messaging, or even perhaps less formal emails (there's a distinct difference, in my mind at least, between formal and informal emails; formal emails are written much like letters, whereas informal emails are more like instant messages or Facebook comments).",1211697308

199383,comment,198867,199180,0,0,Hexstream,,,"The more sophisticated and less automatable techniques have higher overhead and can degrade user experience. You don't want to ask users to perform 10 special actions in order to identify themselves as human. And if you pick 10 of those actions randomly out of a bank of 100 types of action then the spammers will reverse-engineer each type of action individually and then will produce a function to map what's displayed by the user interface to each type of action.<p>The problem is that the more the CAPTCHA-like artifacts creation process is automatable the more their cracking tend to be automatable. And if you truly find a way to generate CAPTCHA-likes cheaply and that are impossible to crack by machines then the job will be shipped to the third world or the spammers will set up sites where you have to accomplish the cracking, perhaps without even knowing it, to get to the free stuff.<p>I don't expect to see the <i>Tragedy of the Commons</i> problem resolved this century.",1211695723

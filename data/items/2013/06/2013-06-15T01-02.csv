Dudes that actually break the law are not our problem, government should get them. The problem is all the other people who are doing nothing wrong other than have opinions or beliefs that the government does not like. Or in the case now are simply sending e-mails. If we can make it harder to get their shit that&#x27;s enough.<p>This whole idea that no we can&#x27;t do it, is defeatist. We can and we should do it, and then we should do more. As much as we can to make it as hard as possible. And if the government still wants to do shit, then let them. That&#x27;s their prerogative.",1371261598
5883569,comment,5883421,5883421,49,0,coreyja,,,"I may be part of the minority here, but I have/see no reason to believe the Facebook is lying about these numbers, or lying about the fact they actually check every request, and don&#x27;t have a NSA backdoor. If I am correct, they only thing that shows Facebook has given the NSA/government agency access to their servers is a leaked PowerPoint presentation. 
I believe it is more than likely that one of the following two options is true.
(1) The PowerPoint is just wrong, and was made it up someone working for a government contractor.
(2) The PowerPoint is inaccurate in that these corporations have complied with the government, when asked to and required by law too, through the use of warrants, both secret and otherwise.<p>Personally I think option 2 is the most likely scenario. Facebook (and Google and most of the other named corporations) have done nothing to lose my trust in them. The only party that at this time, I know is to blame is the NSA/government for conducting a cloaked surveillance operation on the entire US population. Until there is proof, or a reasonable argument, showing that these corporations willingly complies with the NSA and were a part of PRISM, I don&#x27;t think they have lost any substantial part of my trust.",1371261583

Drug cartels and organized crime have for decades required the legal system to occasionally resort to gag orders and secrecy to avoid tipping off the &quot;bad guys&quot; before the legal system is able to act.<p>After all, the legal system is deliberate on purpose as to do otherwise would invite abuses of its own. I would be worried to live in a country where you could be locked up, arraigned, indicted, tried and convicted in just a day.<p>Public interest requires us to have enough due process that the system is inevitably slow. But a completely public system must operate much much faster to be effective against some types of &quot;menace to society&quot;. This includes terrorism but is hardly limited to terrorism.<p>So absolutely we should have that public debate to figure out under what criteria we would operate NSA intel intercepts, what would be public, and what would be secret. But just don&#x27;t be surprised if there are still secrets when it&#x27;s all said and done, with a select group of persons to provide the accountability required to keep the system safe.<p>We <i>do</i> use similar systems for other very dangerous programs after all (e.g. nuc weps).",1371261429

5883552,comment,5883103,5883103,4,0,dfc,,,"Some people who are running tor on their pis are getting messages about your computer being to slow. If you see these messages and are curious about the cause arma posted a good explanation today to tor-relays:<p><i>The current theory is that these happen when your relay becomes the hidden
service directory, or introduction point, for a popular hidden service.
So these are basically roving hotspots that move around the network. In
the case of the hidden service directory the pain lasts about a day,
and in the case of the introduction point, it lasts for some function of
the duration of the introduction point (could be a while) and the time
that the hidden service descriptor is fresh (15 minutes or so). Based
on the logs here, it sounds like it might be the introduction point in
these cases.<p>Here are some tickets to look at:<p><a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3825"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3825</a><p><a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4862"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4862</a><p><a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8950"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8950</a><p>Also, the switch to the new ntor circuit-level handshake should reduce the cpu requirements for create cells (in addition to being more secure). So once more people have switched to ntor, these hotspots shouldn&#x27;t be so
  bad.

I wouldn&#x27;t dare to risk it.<p>For me, I just have always assumed that electronic communications are easier to compromise than old traditional ones. In the end, you connect to an ISP and packets can be inspected. OK, you might have encryption, but there have been too many schemes cracked or broken. So, why ever think that electronic comms can ever be secure? In the extreme, if the spooks get your encrypted data and they really believe that the data contains the &quot;ticking bomb&quot;, they&#x27;ll just torture you until you give up the key. So, you&#x27;re still stuffed. Why give them even that much?<p>More over, the one big issue I have to electronic communications, is that it is very hard to know if you are under surveillance. The old methods give you a better chance to discover that you are being watched. It is also easier to hide the fact that you are communicating at all.<p>The clincher for me was that a while ago an &quot;amusing&quot; story appeared in a British news paper. Essentially it &quot;exposed&quot; MI6 spies in Moscow using actual drop boxes to pass along information. Now, if MI6 are still using pre-WWII methods, that has to tell you something, right? They don&#x27;t trust the electronic methods.<p>So, if secure communications really mattered to me, life or death type mattered, then I&#x27;d be looking at things like one time pads, drop boxes, people, etc. Of course a lot of it depends on what you are trying to communicate, how many people are involved, and frankly how much money you have to use.<p>One thing I do know, electronics would be something I would work very hard to avoid.<p>Lastly, if I were going to whistle blow to a journalist on this scale, the first thing I would establish would be several methods of communication. Times, places, codes, etc. I suspect that, given the nature of this exposure, that will have been done, and none of it will be electronic.",1371259918

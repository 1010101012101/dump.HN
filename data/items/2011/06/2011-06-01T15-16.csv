I suspect that this kind of protection may just be a side effect of assuming that it is generally impossible to tell whether or not an invention was arrived at independently and that it is generally impossible to keep the inner workings of an invention secret.<p>These assumptions are not true in the same way for software as for, say, the typewriter or a particular kind of elevator or even a chemical substance.

The only reason domestic unrest is a more likely danger for a world power is because the country we are speaking of already has missile silos and stationary bases in the first place.<p>Actually, I think you're mistaken, but let's think this through -<p>There's 200 countries in the world, roughly. Call the current world powers America, China, UK, Russia, and maybe a couple other European countries.<p>In any given year, there's a lot more chance of any given country having a riot/unrest than there is an attack by America, China, UK, or Russia. Like, much higher. And usually, there's considerable advance warning before attacks so you could prepare.<p>If you like, you can add in places with a decent mix of either high troop strength or very technologically advanced military - even adding in places like North Korea, Iraq before losing its various recent wars, and Israel doesn't seem to change the numbers that much. The chance of serious unrest in any given country in the world is much higher than the chance of attack by a militarily powerful nation.<p>We could check actual numbers if this isn't convincing, but the number of domestic insurrections every year are much higher than attacks by a major world power.

They are bringing with them a statement, signed by 125 economists, stating an assertion regarding a particular economic issue.<p>Our society has a singular fascination with the opinions of 'experts'. They are rolled out, opinions in hand, during any significant politicking, reporting or discussion. The criteria for being an expert, however, is rather loose.<p>Economists, for instance, make a living through attempting to predict the future. Their predictions are notoriously unreliable. You would have no trouble finding an economist who agrees with either side of any particularly contentious topic; obviously, at least one of them is often wrong. Some of them are wrong more frequently than others.<p>I suggest that it would be beneficial for discourse to keep track of the performance of these 'experts', in any field. There will no doubt be some whose predictions are uncannily accurate. There will be others who consistently perform worse than if they had made assertions at random. There is no current way for the thoughtful but uneducated observer to discern between the two.<p>Figuring out a fair way to do this is not a trivial issue. It is, however, a fascinating one. I think it would make a great - and invaluable - project for someone with an interest in data, statistics and community design. How do you allow user submission of information without being vulnerable to manipulation? What kind of hilarious correlations can you draw between the predictions of those with opposing viewpoints?

This is precisely what the patent system was designed to do - protect large research investments.<p>The abuse of the system for things that really don't require research and development is at issue here.  I think proposals to abolish software patents entirely are probably wrong - but granting patents on XOR, or 1-click, or doing something obvious <i>but on a computer system</i>, are equally wrong.<p>Put it this way: if I have a problem to be solved by software that is really hard (such as your algorithm), then I'm going to research it before spending five man-years developing it, find you guys, and happily license your solution.  No question.  And if somebody reverse engineers your solution and sells it, then by God they should be penalized for violating your patent.  This is why we have patents.<p>But if I have an idea like 1-click and pay an Indian developer $10 an hour for a week to develop it, this is simply not worthy of monopoly protection; your disclosing your solution isn't that valuable.  If, seventeen years from now, after I've built an online shopping empire while you haven't, you sell your patent to Lodsys and they sue me for a billion dollars out of the blue, <i>that</i> is highway robbery, and it's not in any way helping society - and that is the situation we actually currently have.",1306940458

With selenium, you record user actions, and verify properties about the state of the site.<p>The record/playback feature is designed to make a copy of the content you look at during a session, allowing you to retrieve it offline at a later time by revisiting the page (or making equivalent HTTP calls).<p>Interestingly, if you use both together, you can design a offline-mode reader for hacker news for use on the train or other disconnected environments. Or, combine selenium and playback mode to create kick ass demos that are less likely to fail on weak wifi networks. :)",1363283981

Can you get a lot done in Lisp? Sure, if you can scan through and make sense of it. I've tried for a long time, almost to the point of barging in on my work time, but I haven't been able to get comfortable. The innumerable parentheses, for example, make perfect sense to those with the Lisp brain, but since I'm reading it in the context of English, where too many of those are frowned upon, it's nearly impossible for me to follow quickly.<p>Whenever I bring this up among my colleagues, I get shot down by the proficient folks.

One of the 9/11 Commission members concluded: ""Much more information needs to be declassified.

If it dumped core, without TCO you would see something like 'rf rf rf rf ...'. With TCO, you would see 'rf' once, just as if it dumped core while on a loop. Which is actually what TCO <i>means</i>: translation of recursive functions into functions that use loops, at the AST level. The result is code that's easier to debug (because it's not recursive at the stack trace level), easier to understand (because it's recursive at code level) and that performs better (because it's a loop at machine code level).<p>So yeah, you could make the case that it's not ""an accurate stack trace"", because it isn't.

The problem that this supposedly solves, is that verbal agreements are non binding and leave wiggle room.<p>If you cant trust the other party, the only recourse is the full legal contract. If you can trust the party then the handshake and the intention is enough.<p>Further more even handshake deals made by trustworthy agents with the best intentions sometimes fall apart before the full legal contract is signed. This will never go away.<p>Bottomline, handshake deals work in situations where the reputation of the individuals with each other is more valuable than the benefit of breaking a given handshake deal. Its just game theory really.<p>Further if the protocol did get buy in and become widespread, it will eventually reach a point where there are true legal ramifications for breaking a handshake deal. At which point everyone will (and should) refuse to make these deals for the same reason no one signs million dollar contracts without having the lawyers review the details.",1363282652

And the offers included some from high profile companies.<p>Once you receive an offer you have the choice to either interview with the company or decline to interview. I actually chose to decline three of the six interview offers I received because one company looked like a horrible fit off the bat, one company offered a small raise but required moving to the bay area (which I was open to for the right circumstances but not that one) and one company offered me a salary below my current salary (Developer Auction allows you to set a minimum salary it would require for you to consider moving to another company, I actually listed my minimum as below my current salary to try to leave open the possibility of moving to an early stage company).<p>If you choose to interview with a company the process proceeds as it would normally and you may have still have to go through a rigorous hiring process. The purpose of the site is less to create an actual auction and more to shift the power in the hiring process toward the employee. It really helps you do a comprehensive job search with a lot of companies in a short amount of time. It solves the job search problem of accepting an offer and wondering if something else is out there that's a better fit.

5376395,comment,5375929,5375929,61,0,tc,,,"This protocol causes a valid and enforceable contract to be formed.<p>In fact, the constraints imposed by the protocol are almost exactly what you might learn about contracts in the first year of law school.  A contract is composed of a 1) reasonably specific offer, 2) acceptance of that offer, and 3) some consideration between the parties.<p>By forbidding vague offers, PG is assuring that obviously questionable or unenforceable agreements aren't made.  The consideration in this case is the startup reserving space in its round for the investor.<p>As far as steps 3 and 4, documenting the agreement is obviously valuable, but the contract is formed at the end of step 2 [2].<p>Now, it does seem unlikely that anyone would try to enforce this in court, in the same way that few are going to start a legal case over someone backing out on a term sheet, but if you could show damages based on your reliance on the other party's performance, you would in theory have a case.<p>Interestingly, it seems that either PG et al. must have aligned this protocol with the constraints of contract law, or in trying to achieve their ends, they independently reinvented the contract formation protocol that has been with us for at least hundreds of years.<p>--<p>Edit #1: Regarding the questions along the lines of, ""this can't be a contract because there are many other terms to address,"" a contract can <i>always</i> be longer.  If you don't address a term in a contract a court will try to divine the intent of the parties, or look at industry norms, or use defaults established by statute law, and try to do something reasonable.  A valid contract isn't dependent on covering every possible, or even every usual, term.  The fact that one party <i>reasonably relied</i> on the agreement and was thereby harmed by the other party's non-performance is often going to be sufficient.<p>[2] (edit): By reducing the contract to writing, even just one sentence in an email (steps 3 & 4), you would fulfill many statutory requirements for written agreements on certain kinds of transactions.<p>Edit #3: To be clear, I believe the contractual nature of this protocol is a feature, not a bug.  You really do want the elements of a contract regardless of whether this is going to be enforced by a court, a person's own conscience, reputation networks, or public shaming.",1363282206

I am a black woman and the founder of Airfordable (fly.airfordable.co)based in DC.  There has been an increasing number of black woman founders in the startup space. They are very much vocal about it. I guess because I seek out to find them and associate myself with the programs they organize. For example, www.DigitalUndivided.com/ @DigUnDiv brings together 100 black women founders in tech startups every fall in NYC for workshops, pitch competitions etc. They also host events during the year in cities like Mountain View, Detriot, NYC, chicago ATL etc. They are very active on twitter as well. There's also www.Blerdology.co/ @blerdology (a movement of Black Nerds) that hosts hackathons to target black techies among other programs. I actually won first place and best startup idea at their very first hackathon in ATL that landed an investor meeting. Both groups had events at SXSWi last week.

Here is my take about this.<p>If you look at papers from Microsoft like Seide et al 2011 and similar papers the reported improvement against state of the art (up to 30%) is really impressive and seems solid. Now, the technique is more or less using a very big multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a technique already established two decades ago (or more). There is some fancy stuff like the deep belief network based initialization, but it does not make big differences. The core of the recipe itself is not very new. What has changed is the scale of data we have available and the size of the models that we can handle.<p>With this I am not implying that this is not a very interesting discovery. But it is important to bear in mind that the change in the amount of data could also make other 20 year old techniques interesting again. On the other hand, neural networks had a bad name in the last years for understandable reasons. They are a blackbox, or at least less transparent than the statistical methods. This makes them prone to cause the ""black box delusion"" effect. You hear a new algorithm is in town, it has fancy stuff like remotely resembling human thinking architectures or cool math but you can not completely grasp it guts, then ""voila!"" suddenly you are overestimating its relevance and scope of applicably. MLPs were hailed as ""the"" tool for machine learning already once, I think for these same reasons. For me the right position here is a prudent skepticism.<p>On the other hand, this should also push people to try new/old radical stuff since the rules of the game seem to be changing, it is not a moment to be conservative in ML research :).",1363281678

And they are poor because of their governments are bad.<p>And if a country with malaria suddenly started to grow quickly, it itself would also quickly solve its malaria problem.<p>So what do charities do? They fund malaria cures, not government reform. They fund the treatment of symptoms, not the root cause.<p>And why don't we fund the root cause? It turns out it may well be much harder than curing malaria. How do you un-corrupt a thoroughly corrupt government?<p>And Europe has a horrific colonial history with the developing world, especially Africa. First worlders attempting to dictate what and how 3rd world leaders should do would be embarrassingly reminiscent of colonialism. And here embarrassing means leader might lose the perceived power which keeps them in office.<p>And lastly donor countries tend to have laws against corruption which would punish charities for paying off foreign leaders. Even if they are paying them off to reduce poverty or something good like that.<p>So here is a totally crazy idea. Make an exception to foreign corruption laws if the cause is worth it.<p>Then offer secret payment to developing world leaders if they meet certain metrics. And also offer them advice on what to do to meet the metrics. And do it all in secret.<p>Imagine Kim Jong Un one day suddenly starts slowl and steady market reforms. Imagine 10 years later North Korea is growing quite fast, and Kim Jong Un is a dedicated fighter of corruption. Imagine Kim Jong Un himself starts to encourage direct democracy, first at village level and then higher. Imagine a few years later Kim Jong Un gives an emotional speech about the two Koreas being one, liberty and democracy in the North, and then resigns leaving a Swiss like democratically chosen group of people in charge, and a North Korean government structure looking quite similar to that of Switzerland. Then Kim Jong Un moves to southern California with a mysterious fortune of several billion dollars, a universal pardon from the US president, and protection from foreign prosecution in the states.",1363281226

Makes me wonder how long he was exposed to Scheme. For me, programming in Scheme is a wonderful experience, way more pleasant that in Python.<p>In Scheme is really clear what is an efficient or inefficient piece of code. Rather in Python, where I found myself going back and forward trying to figuring out what is happening behind the scenes to see if I can do it in a more efficient way.<p>Don't get me wrong, I will take a slow Python against something faster like Java any day.

Lisp because of all of the parens and the sometimes ""backwards"" dataflow of nested functions. Go because of the ""imperativeness"", the frequent manual returns for errors, the mandatory {} for blocks.<p>In both cases, that was a deliberate choice in order to get <i>simple</i> syntax. The beauty they are focused on is larger-scale beautiful <i>semantics</i>. Lisp with macros, first-class functions, etc. Go with interfaces, goroutines, and channels.<p>Where some languages treat the syntax as a first-class feature, I think Go and Lisp treat it more as a means to an end. That being said, in both cases, practitioners of those languages do specifically like their syntaxes. It's just not a major focus of the language designers' time.",1363280601

Now if there were some of that evidence with regard to South America, we&#x27;d be all clear. But there isn&#x27;t as far as I know, which raises even more questions about the sweet potato conjecture.<p>With regard to the glacial maximum, nobody is claiming the oceans were plains to roam around.

10143613,comment,10141798,10143457,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Oh absolutely, I think there&#x27;s also definitely a sense of disdain for the US in the Netherlands for many of the reasons you mention. (democrats being much further right than even the VVD, healthcare had been a joke for decades, substantial debt as a condition for getting a college education, public schools being sub-par, media like Fox News are a joke etc). My point wasn&#x27;t in saying that the Netherlands is like it, but rather that compared to say France or Germany or Italy or many European countries, we&#x27;ve drawn a lot from the US. The vast majority of all popular movies, music, television shows and books are from the US. Not to mention consumer culture.<p>And while we&#x27;re pretty good at standing our ground, we tend to flirt with a lot of American concepts. For example mandatory sentences, a staple of the American justice system, has been numerously put forward by some Dutch politicians, despite fierce resistance from judges and attorneys. Private schools, honours programmes, the removal of study finance during a slow rise of private funding by scholarships. In healthcare we&#x27;ve seen a very slow but noticeable trend to drop fundamental aspects of healthcare from mandatory collective basic insurance towards &#x27;additional&#x27; insurance packages, from &#x27;de pill&#x27; (not insured for 21 and older) to the majority of dental work. Some years ago we flirted with flexible pricing in dental work, fortunately when it turned out to be a disaster the government didn&#x27;t double down but sensibly shut it down. And in the rest of society we saw a period of deregulation (since the crisis the trend partially reversed) and privatisation.<p>You can find these influences all over Europe of course, but the degree of pervasiveness of American influence in say France or Germany isn&#x27;t quite as large. France has Hollywood, sure, but mixed with French cinema, and often dubbed.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget for example that France actually has specific anti-foreign policies. It&#x27;s not often discussed but France has had screen quotas for decades, i.e. cinemas aren&#x27;t allowed to show foreign movies for substantial parts of the year. 40% of TV must be exclusively French and another 20% European, leaving American influence a minority. Stuff like that is intentional, to have France remain French, in the Netherlands it&#x27;s contrary to our international diplomatic and business model which is to be an open economy, which is susceptible to influences from abroad, and naturally in particular from the world&#x27;s hegemony. In France it&#x27;s called cultural exceptionalism, mostly practiced in cinema and literature. As a proxy of its success in sustaining a vibrant French cinema industry you could point to a study (pretty old now) in the late 90s about the number of cinema festivals France held compared to other European countries here: <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/timeline/13255a67eb1bab4307fe904d9e06a964.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/timeline/13255a67e...</a><p>But I do agree with you we&#x27;ve been able to do things a &#x27;Dutch way&#x27; quite well, and sensible Dutch policy is pretty much the only source of nationalism or pride for the country I have.

He had applied to return to GCHQ, in Cheltenham, but bosses were slow in approving this.  Mr Williams, a keen cyclist originally from Anglesey, North Wales, died shortly after returning from a hacking conference in America.  He had been to see a drag queen show by himself two days before he was last seen alive, on August 15, 2010.  Eight days later his naked body was found folded into the 32in by 19in bag placed in the bath of his flat in Pimlico, central London.  His mobile phone and sim cards were laid out on a table. The last computer evidence of him being alive showed him looking at a cycling website.  Detectives are still baffled as to how the maths genius and expert cryptographer died.<p>EDIT: Two weeks ago, there was another &quot;source&quot; with new information.  Somebody wants to keep the investigation alive?<p>> Now a source at the heart of the investigation has told The Mail on Sunday that Scotland Yard detectives believe an agent from an unknown secret service broke into the victim’s flat to destroy or remove evidence.\nThe new claim centres on the revelation that part of the forensic equipment placed in the flat after the body was found was moved – despite the fact the building was under armed police guard.\nSpecial footplates, which allow officers to walk across a crime scene without contaminating it, were moved after the first day of the investigation. This led Scotland Yard to conclude that someone must have scaled the building’s walls and broken in through the skylight to cover their tracks. <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3199587/Agents-killed-body-bag-spy-got-flat-skylight-destroy-evidence-New-theory-solve-mystery-five-years-later.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3199587/Agents-kille...</a>",1440948411

10143508,comment,10142587,10142587,0,0,joesmo,,,"I think the disease model is the primary model of addiction in the US because it helps relieve the stigma and hate of the rest of society against addicts, not because it&#x27;s an accurate model. It&#x27;s popularized by 12-step programs a lot more than it is by doctors, thus most people that support this model have no scientific basis, rationale, or reasoning for doing so other than it&#x27;s better than the alternative, which is to see addiction as a moral failing, a failure of willpower, or a character defect. As another post here points out, those are indeed the old ways of seeing addiction, of society to blame and ostracize addicts. That model is also incorrect, mostly postulated by people who are not addicts, have no experience with addiction, and are generally just looking to place blame and hate rather than for a realistic model of addiction.<p>Personally, I think both camps are wrong and the most evidence is towards addiction being a societal problem, rather than an individual disease. It&#x27;s easy to underestimate the influence of one&#x27;s environment on one&#x27;s actions, but phenomena like the massive drop-off in addiction rates of Vietnam veterans are rather hard to explain otherwise (<a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/01/02/144431794/what-vietnam-taught-us-about-breaking-bad-habits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/01/02/14443179...</a>). This is a hard pill to swallow in a place like America where it&#x27;s ingrained in the culture that people be blamed for whatever wrongdoings they have committed, regardless of the utility of such blame, and regardless of the reality of the blame. A lot of people want to maintain a moralistic high ground and many of those do it simply because they enjoy putting others down and causing conflict (usually because they are suffering themselves). How can people with such attitudes ever look honestly at themselves, their own actions, their communities, and ask themselves if some of these things might somehow be responsible for the suffering of others&#x27; in society? They can&#x27;t and they won&#x27;t.<p>I do not think any one particular societal problem can be blamed for addiction, but things like poverty, disease, lack of opportunities, exposure to hate, exposure to trauma, etc. are likely culprits. In a country where anything related to the common good or community is eschewed and often considered un-American, it&#x27;s no wonder that many people find themselves disconnected, alone, and unwanted. Our society not only shuns the poor and different, but even many of those actively involved in building it, people with jobs who are actively striving to make things better for themselves. Teenagers and young adults who don&#x27;t live in a city are left to their own boredom by parents who may care, but who cannot do anything about the boredom of suburbia. These people often turn to drugs because they&#x27;re essentially being neglected by their parents, peers, and likely the educational system or simply do not have the means to socialize because of the distances involved. They develop addiction patterns they will rely on as adults. These are just a couple of examples I can think of off the top of my head of neglect, abuse, hate, poverty, and trauma than a huge portion of the population in the US experiences. Certainly, not everyone will become an addict, but such extreme societal disfunction is a much more likely culprit for addiction than either the disease model or the morality/willpower model.<p>Specifically, the disease model fails to explain people who are &#x27;cured&#x27; and stop using, people who use for only a few years, people who can stop and use at societally accepted levels, etc. The morality/willpower model assumes that we are in control of all actions, that outside events and the environment have no influence on human behavior, and most ridiculous of all, that humans act in a rational matter 100% of the time (silly Kantian ideas). The failings of both of these models are so egregious, I do think it&#x27;s time to retire both and start to seriously study addiction scientifically rather than provide explanations that we have been pre-conceived ahead of time and fly in the face of evidence.",1440947470

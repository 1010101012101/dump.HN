102234,comment,101703,101703,0,0,jamescoops,,,"i would try doing it on the side for a while and then quit when you physically cant manage doing both any more.  You could use your wages to pay for outsources to help you build a first release e.g. designers, logo etc.  In my view we all waste 50% of our day being unproductive so you might as well get paid for that bit.  Also it takes a long time for a site to start ranking in search engines etc and getting traffic so that's another reason to build something slowly first.",1201017268

102231,comment,101964,102042,0,0,simeonf,,,"Well - yes I can see the need for specialised training when dealing with a lot of kids with a diversity of abilities, disabilities, cognitive levels, etc. And faced with a roomful (30+ kids) - yeah that's a challenge.<p>What about 1 kid though? Maybe Mom-with-a-high-school-education is only 25% as effective at teaching a 6 year old phonics as somebody with a couple years of upper division child development and educational pedagogy would be. Homeschooling can still be a win for the kid, however, because Mom can afford to spend 3-4 hours of one-on-one instruction a day. There's no way the (granted: much more effective) elementary school teacher can match that sort of investment of time.",1201017125

102229,comment,102172,102177,0,0,sebg,,,"Definitely a short term solution.  However, Fed has two prong mandate. Unemployment and inflation.  In the short run they can try to affect unemployment by cutting rates as the economy goes into recession.  In the long run they will have to pay attention to the inflation figures.  Given the recent write downs by financial institutions, the way the equity markets outside of the US are behaving, and the last unemployment number, it makes sense for the Fed to try to help out the economy in the short run.",1201017005

I suspect the latter.<p>Long gone are the days when the ""system analyst"" met with the users, wrote tight functional specifications and handed them to the ""business programmer"".  In any organization that actually gets anything done, the two are now one position, the ""programmer analyst"", and it's been that way for 20 years now.<p>And what does a programmer analyst have to do?<p>- examine and understand almost any business situation<p>- solve technical and logistical problems<p>- present ideas clearly and cleanly<p>- organize and manage time and tasks<p>- play nicely with others<p>- and, oh yea, code<p>And where do you find people who can do these things?  Lots of places, but the 2 that come to mind first are from work experience or college experience.  Nobody actually believes anymore that you'll use anything from class in your work.  But it can be a very good place to develop the life skills needed to be a programmer analyst.<p>Nobody's going to ask you to write a linear programming model using the simplex method to determine how to allocate continuous inventory to customer orders.  (OK, maybe they will.)  But they will wonder why Mary and Joe can't seem to figure out how to use Program ORP560 to generate this month's performance metrics.  Is the problem with them or the program?  They'll tell you to figure it out and fix it.  Count on it.  And count on college to help you become the kind of person who can do that.",1201015266

I also believe I got the most out of radix in my tests. The 4-bit version of radix wasn't trivial, but it was reasonably fast and the mem usage was twice as better than the 8-bit one, as I said before.<p>But even speculatively, on paper if you wish, radix consumes more memory than some good hash table implementation.<p>Upd. forgot to mention, I did some more optimizations as well, like compressing the pointer tables in tree nodes.",1201014952

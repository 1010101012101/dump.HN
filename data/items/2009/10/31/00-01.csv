There's not necessarily a ton of fledgling artists out there who'd actually be good investments but it's a niche where the offer may make a fair amount of sense from both sides.<p>Essentially you should be asking: what potentially-highly-remunerative ""career paths"" are (a) open to people in their early-mid 20s and (b) such that star talents exist and (c) such that star talents would find this type of investing a better option than their existing funding options.",1256950771

913104,comment,911170,911999,0,0,hyperbovine,,,"Taking math classes in school, even at the graduate level, feels like pattern matching to me. On all tests and most homeworks you're expected to stare at a problem long enough until its structure becomes isomorphic to something about which you memorized a theorem. Whether you understand what makes the theorem tick or not is a separate question, but I found a workable test taking strategy in my classes consists of memorizing the theorems that the prof made a big deal about in class, and then just running down the list for each problem.<p>Research math is more open-ended but the idea is the same. The quantity of genius mathematicians who sit down, a la Newton or Gauss, and invent their own mathematics out of thin air is exceedingly small. Most research in math today, even among the ""big"" papers, is pretty incremental.",1256949844

That's why the faces of cubist subjects have both a profile and frontal view. This artist really needs to find a 4D subject to represent in 3D. That would be closer to the spirit of cubism.",1209538689

If you plan on being an entrepreneur anyway, you don't have to give up a decade, you just give up 3-4 years - you don't have to do a residency.",1209538616

In my opinion, you can use the skills and capital to develop a product or service that could help people on a much larger scale. However, in the end, we still need a doctor in the house. God knows you love it all...I suggest you start asking Him what you really should be doing.",1209538337

I was just mainly looking at the idea of fulfillment, and the fact that you can give up a decade for one type, or jump right into real life as a younger individual in pursuit of a different type.",1209538179

With ubiquitous access to seemingly useful resources, it is very easy to give into such and deviate from the intended reading material. Book publishers don't seem to get this when devising their solutions for the declining book readership problem.<p>Another note by me: Good writing is very similar to good programming/programming language design/engineering: a system/text does not get better by adding more to it, but when you can't remove anything from it anymore without changing your intent/its purpose.<p>Petzold could have done with a shorter post ;)",1209538116
177335,comment,177315,177315,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"You have described a very romanticized and inaccurate picture of both medicine and tech startups. I come from a family of doctors and most doctors are not directly saving lives on a daily basis. Likewise, the work in a startup can be incredibly mundane.<p>I could paint an equally distorted portrait of both fields: Do you want to be  stuck at an HMO, explaining to crabby hypochondriacs that you can't just give them a script for oxycontin based on website printout they are waving in your face? Or would you rather stay up until 4 am every night restarting the server while your business partner tweets about doing shots next to Arrington at 111 Minna?<p>Anyway, that was mainly an exercise in creative writing. The only real advice I have is that if you have any inclination to do work in a medical related field, it is a good idea to have an MD. I've worked on biomedical software projects and was always just a paid lackey.<p>I knew a kid in boston in medical school who ran a successful web-based startup part-time while he was in medical school. He was a ""kid"" too, I believe he was 18 or 19 years old. Thanks for bringing this up, I should see where that guy is now.",1209537924

We should have another 1000 pages of printing left, so I'm worried that by the time we run out of toner, it will no longer be made.  I'm thinking about buying one now, but I don't want to be stuck with a $50 toner if my cheap laser breaks.",1209537865
177333,comment,177315,177315,0,0,LPTS,,,"You can probably have a bigger impact on health as an entrepreneur than a doctor.<p>I'm working on a start up addressing the medication adherence problem.  I think a solution to a problem like that helps more people then an MD in most circumstances would and represents the exciting lifestyle you love.  I think you got yourself a false dichotomy set up.<p>It sounds to me like you have a passion for technology and a guilt issue around helping people with health care.  You're saying ""on one hand, I feel obligated towards A, and on the other, I've dreamed of B.""<p>From what you said, I think you should stick with tech and find a way to work on a start up that could produce equal health benefits to an MD.  I particularly think you shouldn't get an MD.  You sound like you really don't want to get one.<p>Feeling like most of web 2.0 would be a waste of your life bodes well for you.  It means you have high personal standards and clearly perceive the big picture when most people are distracted.  You should feel fine belittling almost the whole field.  Most of them are wasting their lives on completely frivolous things.  Especially the ones who get by on ads.  If you don't feel comfortable clearly criticizing people without sentimentality, you will never be able to manifest your high standards.<p>But the frivolity and lack of moral vision common to most start ups are not a prerequisite to starting a company.  It's false that giving up medicine costs you a chance to truly help people.  Apply technology in such a way that it has medical import, with high standards, and you can have your dream and help more people than you would as an MD.",1209537609

Finish your training and practice for a few years so that you understand the issues deeply and can address them with authority. If you are entrepreneurial you will find a way to blend it into your practice. It's not too late to start a company in your 30's once you have gotten a thorough exposure to the issues.",1209537065

Or would you feel a bit like a grounded child having to watch his friends play outside?<p>If you love helping people then medicine can be a good choice. But practicing medicine has changed considerably in the last 10-20 years with managed care. While I come from a family involved in medicine, I was always encouraged to pursue my passion for computers instead because the rewards  of being a doctors are just not what they were.

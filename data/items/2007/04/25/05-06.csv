It warns people not to engage in the activity that my website organizes. Do you think that negative PR is still good?<p>Here's the article<p><a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2007-04-24-student-assassin-game_N.htm"">http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2007-04-24-student-assassin-game_N.htm</a>",1177480178

It should be pretty simple to build a very fast device which spreads the blocks across a large number of flash cards. I suppose you could do a raid array of addonics adapters, but it's unclear how that would perform (and it might be a mess dealing with a large number of them).",1177478859

My wife's phone has a dial-by-voice feature that she uses all the time to select from her contacts, and it's a prepaid phone she bought outright for 19 bucks.  This suggests to me that voice recognition for things like ""Call Mike"" is a solved problem.",1177477634

I don't think that it will be able to sustain high transaction rates (100,000 tps for small transactions should be very doable). If you find that this isn't true and that someone has demonstrated these rates, let me know -- it would certainly be good news.",1177477223

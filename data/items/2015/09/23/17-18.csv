We are more likely to detect a strong intended broadcast and will be so for the foreseeable future.<p>Your parenthetical is a good question.<p>We ourselves have sent a message to M13, a globular cluster ~20K lya. (See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message</a>) The only reason? To say &quot;We are here.&quot; The thinking behind the choice of target was that the stars are close together so for one message we get more likely reception. That thinking was flawed because stars in a globular cluster are hot, young, and short-lived, so unlikely to support life, much less complex life.<p>We will probably begin sending similar messages when we discover more likely candidates. We are very close to being able to detect the atmospheres of Earth and super-Earth exoplanets. If we find one that contains a significant amount of free oxygen, it will be a good candidate for life, and I can certainly see us sending a signal to these planets.<p>The point of such a message is that for relatively small cost, we can potentially discover we are not the only intelligent life in the universe.<p>Additionally, the sheer knowledge that could be acquired if both species beamed constant signals to each other about their cultures, scientific discoveries, and etc., would be damn near priceless. Even if we found a civilization slightly behind ours or on the same level as ours, there would suddenly be <i>two</i> Earths with both similar and dissimilar problems with both similar and dissimilar solutions to those problems. Our knowledge of the universe and our ability to solve problems would grow, even if our mutual civilizations lagged behind each other by (say) 100 years due to the distance.",1443031092

10266718,comment,10264866,10264866,0,0,grellas,,,"The analysis in this article is very superficial.<p>Liquidation preferences do not drive up valuations. Of course, they offer &quot;insurance&quot; to preferred stock investors against downside risk. But they have being so for several decades in the Valley (and elsewhere) and this has nothing to do with valuations as such.<p>Indeed, when valuations are at their very lowest (such as post dot-bomb in the early 2000&#x27;s), the liquidation preferences became so high as to be regarded as absurd (e.g., 3x or even higher). This was often coupled with the idea that the preferred stock would be participating, meaning that the investors in any M&A deal get their 1x (or 2x or 3x or whatever) back <i>and</i> also get to take their proportionate share of the merger consideration on the M&A deal itself.<p>The reason there are $1B+ valuations is primarily because the VCs believe the ventures will come to dominate major areas of commerce, will typically go public with sky-high valuations, and will continue to grow and dominate even after all that. Investing $100M at $1B valuation is risky but pays hugely if the company later becomes valued at $100B+. Yet, when a company goes public, the terms of the preferred stock typically require conversion into common stock and, in that case, the liquidation preference goes away altogether and confers no benefit on the investor.<p>In short, very incorrect analysis and not really worth reading.",1443031086

But from the perspective of the public at large, they are being exploited to engage in pseudo-fraud.<p>Right now, the world treats a company&#x27;s &#x27;valuation&#x27; as a reliable signal of information about how much investors actually believe the company is worth. That information is then integrated into heuristics that influence various people&#x27;s decisions: Will a paper write about a startup? Will a reader pay attention? Will a recruit take the company seriously? A billion dollar valuation goes a long way in each circumstance.<p>The problem is that our collective intuitions are using an outdated algorithm for assessing value. In theory, VCs who invest at a given valuation are providing reliable information by putting their money where their mouth is. But in practice, liquidation preference means that the official valuations attached to their deals don&#x27;t really reflect the limited risks they are taking on.<p>A VC who invests $10 million at $1 billion valuation may officially be signaling to the world that a company is valuable. But if he insists on a two-times liquidation preference, then he is really indicating that when the whole thing blows up he wants to make sure he can get the first $20 million.<p>Unfortunately, that information isn&#x27;t broadcast the same way to outside decision makers. Even those of us who think that startups are grossly overvalued don&#x27;t give enough thought to how illusory those valuations are to the very investors whose capital is fueling them.<p>I hope that will start to change.",1443031060

VW has been in and out of the US diesel car market with every change in the price of gasoline since the first diesel Rabbits in the 1970&#x27;s when famously, they had to remove the assertion that diesel fuel was less expensive than gasoline from their television commercials.<p>This way, Volkswagen Passenger Cars [a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagen Group] does not have to negotiate with its US car dealers regarding a lineup change that removes high profit options and models that bring customers onto the lot who often drive off with some other VW instead of a TDI.

Neodymium for motors, tantalum for capacitors, lithium for batteries - all of those are bad news bears for the environment.  Even stuff like copper isn&#x27;t particularly awesome to produce.  All other things being equal (mileage, emissions, etc), you should prefer the vehicle with a simple aluminum frame and engine over the high-tech wundercar because the impact of producing and disposing of it is lower.<p>To the actual question - yeah, diesels running on biodiesel actually produce less GHG emissions than even hybrids.  Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel is pretty close but just a bit above hybrids.  The National Academy of Sciences published a study back in 2010 on the topic.  The report itself is paywalled but there&#x27;s a copy on the Arkansas state website.  I snapped an image of the chart for ease of viewing.<p>Note that ULSD was only introduced in the US in 2010 (2006 for Cali).  The Euros have had it for quite a bit longer.  So when you&#x27;re reading studies, if it predates 2010 and it doesn&#x27;t specifically say ULSD or Biodiesel then you should disregard it, because the new fuels are vastly cleaner and the playing field has shifted dramatically as a result.  Biodiesel is often notated as something like B100, B85, or BD20 denoting the percentage of biodiesel in a mixture with fossil diesel.  Pure B100 has a fairly high gel point and can cause problems starting in cold areas, so these mixtures include a fraction of ULSD to lower the gel point.<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/FEOo1zB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/FEOo1zB</a><p><a href=""http://1.usa.gov/1gO9jPL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1.usa.gov/1gO9jPL</a>",1443028775

I haven&#x27;t seen Robots, but this kind of constrained, multiple-degree-of-freedom movement would not be possible in an &quot;open world&quot; -- you have to have existing infrastructure, and for something like cables (which &quot;operate&quot; in tension only), that infrastructure has to surround the entire &quot;vehicle&quot;. And cables have an effective practical length limit before you run into a number of physics barriers. Now, you could have something that operates by a cable pulling a car along a predefined route, but it would be a simple linear movement. Not only can you, we already do this: most ski lifts work this way. So do, for example, the SF cable cars.<p>2. Even if you could, should you?<p>The tl;dr here is that in the vast majority of modern cases, other technology is better. If you&#x27;re going to expend a whole bunch of money on infrastructure, which is necessary for public transportation in general, why not make it something higher capacity? Lightrail, or high-speed bus, or really almost any other form of public transportation is more effective. Where the ski lift approach shines is in low-volume, low-speed transport across terrain that would be very, very difficult (read: expensive) to lay tracks or road across, like mountains. Similarly, the cable car approach shines in situations where rails offer questionable traction in adverse conditions, and a positive connection with something is hugely beneficial (like a very steep hill).

I can't stop coding, it's actually kind of ""sick"" since I get like 4 hours of sleep.<p>I have PG to blame because his whole advice on ""learn to code"" was so very true.  I'm not a CS major (I did take a 'few'classes) but Rails really makes sense to me.   Coding is just so..logical.",1178988623

21609,comment,21107,21107,0,0,Leonidas,,,"I'm helping my dad design a replacement for the Digital Signal Processor.  Actually, it's already designed and it actually works through the Phase I testing.  Talk about years of painfully drawing up electric engineering diagrams and deciphering electric engineering language to a way that you would understand it to draw the diagram and write the description out. It's like having a crash course on 4 years of EE education in a week.  (I'm not an EE major).  Not to mention making suggestions upon the improvement of the design and have your dad say ""no it won't work"" only to find out days later that your proposal actually works but your dad is just too proud to admit it.  I think the closest he got to an offer was from Nokia but he chickened out and didn't pursue it.  Sucks for him and especially for me who spent days finding a personal contact information to someone at Nokia.<p>Too bad, he's one of those guys who just likes to invents to see if it works.  Not much of a 'start a company' guy...I think he just wants to sit back and enjoy the rest of his life as opposed to dealing with the politics of a company. 9 years on working on something and the fear of someone stealing your idea keeps you from sharing it to the world. It's a shame but oh well.  It's his 'baby'<p>I have my own 'baby' project to work on.<p><p>\n",1178987557

Getting the distribution and the cross-platform functionality is the challenge. Once you've done that, picking off a couple more browser annoyances would be relatively straightforward. <p>Obviouly feature creep is a problem, but if you want this thing to be widely out there picking off a couple more things might help others push it.",1178986664

Do you have any?'<p>Withdraw if you like.  I'm normally not one to get into political/ideological debates, but a statement like this deserves to be challenged.<p>Yes, my examples are foreigners in a time of war.  But, you said 'anyone', not US Citizens. But even if you ignore this (which I wouldn't really - a society should be judged by how it treats humans regardless of which country they happen to be a part of), you are still misguided.<p>How about Martin Luther King being jailed for anti-segregation protests?  Does that count to your re-framed question?<p>I don't know if this could happen today (although the stage seems to be set with the wonderfully named Patriot Act which among other things has a section 215 which allows the FBI to search your library records), but the fact that it happened only a few decades ago should make you think twice before uttering blanket statements.\n",1178986126

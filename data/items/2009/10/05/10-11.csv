Knowing which applies to you can really help you quit and there's questionnaires that can pinpoint which you are.<p>Sample questions:<p>Do you smoke a cigarette when you wake up?

It's all about the execution.<p>Conversely, many would-be startup founders I've talked to seem to think that their idea is <i>the most valuable thing they have</i>. That they need to keep their super-unique idea under wraps, for fear of it getting out and someone else doing it instead.",1254739594

That in itself isn't exactly exciting.  The non-geeky crowd really only cares (most of the time) about why they should hand you any cash--i.e., what's this going to do for me?  (That is, if you're expecting any cash in the first place...)  You really will come out better describing benefits versus features.  Furthermore, I've found that smart potential customers will interrupt you in the middle of listing a bunch of features to ask, ""Ok, so how's this really going to help me??"" anyway.  Better to start off in a good way than to get embarrassed.",1254737897

So the article's contention that there can be no success without both good execution and a good idea is completely accurate. Selling books is a good idea, selling dead leaves isn't.<p>Also, I think you oversimplify the ideas of Amazon, Google, Zappo and Facebook. I would argue that Amazon's idea was more ""selling a massive range of books online via a simple interface"" not just ""selling books"". And there are many variations of the ""online community thing"". The idea for Facebook wasn't the same as the idea for Friends Reunited and it's easy to see how that helped one to prosper and the other to fail.",1254737168

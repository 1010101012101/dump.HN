T. Jaynes.  Jaynes builds, from the ground up, probability theory as an extended logic that allows you to draw inferences from incomplete and uncertain information. In this logic, a probability represents a degree of belief, and Bayes' theorem becomes a rule for updating prior beliefs in light of new evidence. From this basis, Jaynes recreates the classical probability theorems (e.g., sum and product rules) , giving them clear interpretations.<p>If you want to understand this stuff for real, it's hard to beat Jaynes.

As a result I feel kind of distanced from worries about the platform; in fact, I benefit in several ways by having more platforms because they each have strengths and weaknesses w/r to iteration times, debugging, etc. I couldn't have gotten exactly this outcome if I were working in C++, because I would have been starting from too low-level a basis. Although there's a big effort afoot to get native code compiling to sandboxed platforms, my perception is that it strongly favors the platform owners.<p>Ultimately I think we're actually gaining by engaging in a platform arms race.

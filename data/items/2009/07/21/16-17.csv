They are also fun to write (javascript + map/reduce).<p>It appears that JavaScriptDB just maintains indexes of everything, until you have over 2000 objects of a class and then it only updates the indexes of fields when you search on them. This saves you the trouble of initially specifying indexes, but by the time your DB gets big enough that they become important, you'll have to manage them explicitly anyway, and you don't get anything besides plain old lexical sort. Persevere looks great for rapidly developing small projects, but not particularly scalable. The automatic index thing might be handy for a multi-faceted search, which is a pain to do in CouchDB.",1248195032

There is really a lot of tragedy in the living circumstances of the ordinary people creating so many of our mindless consumer products. But at the same time, the jobs creating such products are highly coveted because they beat the hell out of manual labor on a backcountry farm. When you've got such an enormous population bootstrapping into a modern industrialized economy there are huge disparities while the modernization process takes place.<p>I don't think that assigning blame to Apple is warranted here. Apple certainly is horrified at what has happened - not just due to bad PR, but because an engineer took his life over a consumer gadget.<p>There are no easy answers here. My hope is that within a few generations the societal earthquakes will settle down with respect to modernization. Even then though, what does it take to overcome millennia of societal acceptance of suicide?",1248192146

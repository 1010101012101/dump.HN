1946689,comment,1946133,1946541,0,0,trotsky,,,"It would seem relevant to note that your company openDNS has publicly promoted and rolled out DNSCurve, a non-IETF track set of extensions to DNS intended to compete with DNSSEC.<p>DNSCurve makes no attempt to authenticate the source of the DNS data and instead relies on only securing the connection between the the client and server (or server and server). In this way, DNSCurve does not prevent a service provider like openDNS from replacing NXDOMAIN returns with their own sponsored pages.<p>DNSSEC instead aims to ""protect DNS content from third party modification"" which would include third parties like openDNS. Performing this modification is the basis of DNS redirection. OpenDNS's strong complaints about DNSSEC and adoption of an obscure replacement (DNSCurve - About 6,620 results; DNSSEC - About 6,730,000 results) would seem to confirm my original suggestion much better than I can do myself.<p>Paul Vixie on the matter:<p><i>The problem statement for DNSSEC was: ""how can we protect DNS content from third party modification?""  The first parties in this case are the the zone administrator who produces the primary zone content and the ultimate end user or application who consumes that content.  Third parties include Dan Kaminsky or anyone else who might bombard a client with spoofed replies attempting to guess transaction ID's and port numbers; secondary name server operators or hackers who break into those systems; recursive name server operators who may want to rewrite www.google.com to their own search page or to rewrite negative responses to point to their own advertising servers; firewall and IDS operators who might want to rewrite all answers containing profanity or pornography or other illicit content to point at a walled garden.  From DNSSEC's point of view, only the zone administrator should be able to produce content within the namespace of a zone. There are no exceptions.</i><p><a href=""http://www.isc.org/community/blog/201002/whither-dnscurve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isc.org/community/blog/201002/whither-dnscurve</a>",1290920037

1946686,comment,1945782,1945782,0,0,drallison,,,"Programming languages are useful tools, but their purpose is to allow designs to be expressed in an executable form and not to aid your decision process.  The design pattern books (and a few others) abstract away the details of programs so that you can see the chassis and principles upon which it is built.  They are sometimes helpful as you learn about systems structures.  (For example, the Model-View-Control pattern is very common and useful, but it's in not always intuitive.)<p>Perhaps the most educational thing you can do is to choose a real project and write the user level documentation for it, and the use cases, the APIs and the unit tests: <i>all before you  begin to code</i>.<p>Get other people to read your documentation and comment.

Some of them contain real pearls, while others are undeservedly popular. In my opinion, each language is suited to (and perhaps designed for) certain kinds of problems. There is no 'general' software design approach. Each language has developed its own idioms and patterns, which are best learned by tracing through production code of competent programmers who are solving problems that are somewhat similar to yours. Most books actually need to be taken with a grain of salt, as they often sound more authoritative and general than they really are.",1290918852

Unless he saw the court orders, he just made them up. I could give you a bunch of things he was wrong about.  He has a forum where be bans people who disagree with him. He was right about foreclosure gate and others such as the financial bailouts, but totally wrong on his deflation argument and wrong about gold.  He was so wrong about gold that he deleted the precious metal area of his website from public viewing.",1290917380

I asked one of my professors at my Machine Learning masters course about this, and he said ""if I've never heard of it, how good can it be?""<p>Algorithms that replicate biological processes are popular because people can easily grasp them. Anyone can understand why evolutionary systems work, or why neural networks work (because it's in nature, dummy!), but they don't work as well as other, purely mathematical methods.<p>In the end, these sorts of things tend to be toys or marginally useful, where other, more mathematically sound algorithms dominate the landscape. I got very excited about HTMs too, when I didn't know as much about ML as I do now, but I've realised that it hasn't made even a dent in academic circles (you know, the ones with the thousands of people who study these things for a living).",1290917346

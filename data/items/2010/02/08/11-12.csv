(This one only works for people not within line-of-sight.<p>* Have team leads (approx 1 for every 6 people) who can answer more general questions and so act as a buffer between programmers and people who might need to interrupt them.<p>* Provide people with the ways to find answers rather than the answers themselves (This has the dual purpose of making it less convenient to ask you than to look stuff up, and teaching people to be more independent.)<p>* Have times when you are more clearly interruptible - this groups the questioning / passing the time of day, so you can get a longer uninterrupted stretch later.<p>edit: formatting",1265629777

1109529,comment,1109401,1109401,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This article contains a fundamental flaw. It estimates the upset rate in memory due to cosmic ray flux as upsets/bits/hour, but this is an incorrect unit. Upsets depend on the total <i>physical</i> size of the memory (and thus the total neutron flux) and the sensitivity of each memory cell (bit) to cosmic rays. Sensitivity may increase as you decrease the size of memory cells, but not in lock-step with the change in size. A room full of 4 Mbit memory chips will almost certainly have a higher rate of upsets per bit than will a single 2GB DIMM. The figures quoted in the article are from studies of computer systems in the 1980s, so upsets/bits rates are much higher than would be expected with modern RAM (which has 3 orders of magnitude more bits in the same volume).<p>This error is probably why the article's theorized SEU event rate for modern systems is about 3 orders of magnitude higher than experimental evidence suggests (such as from this Google study): <a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf</a>",1265629555

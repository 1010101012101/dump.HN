Which is to say: I'm probably some sort of neanderthal. In this mode, hashtags are kind of useless.<p>But apparently the cutting-edge users of Twitter spend their days plugged into a client which lets them do nifty tricks like following hashtags in real time. I tried that last month, using TweetGrid. It was hypnotic, and kind of fun, but way too much volume. And it featured spam and trolls. Finally, I understood why some people complain about Twitter spam! It would appear that anyone can create a random Twitter account under a fake name and start spewing arbitrarily-hashtagged crap!<p>So I lost interest. But apparently many people have not. Do other folks just <i>inhale</i> all the hashtagged stuff, spam and trolls and Amazon-hating hysteria-inducing <i>agents provocateurs</i> and all? Or do serious Twitter users just follow so many people that they actually find the hashtags useful, just to sort through the Tweets from people they are <i>following</i>?

564412,comment,564032,564211,0,0,warwick,,,"I used to think that a metadata based file system was a really bad idea until two things happened.  I read Jef Raskin's ""The Humane Interface"" and I watched people use web apps and 'database' apps like iTunes.<p>In THI, Raskin covers the idea that the best filename for any given file is the file itself.  If I save a copy of this comment on my computer, I might call it ""HN - Desktop Metaphor/Hierarchical Filesystems"".  That's a lousy name.  Three months down the road when I'm trying to remember where I quoted 'the best filename for any given file is the file itself', it's much more convenient to type in that phrase instead of trying to remember where I put the file.<p>There are two arguments against this approach, both with good counter-arguments.<p>First, if you love your hierarchy, nobody is taking it away from you.  When you save a file, instead of being asked for a filename, you might be prompted for search tags.  Type in a hierarchical file name there (eg. /comments/hackernews/hierarchical filesystems"").<p>Second, what about files with no good textual metadata?  A movie file, an image, etc.  I can't just type in 'movie' and look through them until I find the one I want.  In this case, the system could detect that there's no indexable metadata attached to a file when you go to close it and request that you add a tag.  This is no larger burden than adding a filename now.<p>Of course, ideally you'd never have to 'Save' a file, just delete files you didn't want to save, so instead of 'Save' in the menu bar, you might have an 'Tag' item instead.<p>The other reason I think metadata based systems are feasible is by watching people use software like iTunes or web apps.  As long as the applications that manipulate your data present a reasonable interface for navigating said data, it doesn't matter where the file is actually stored.  Watch an end user play some music with iTunes and see if they ever even care where their files are.

Your old coworker John? He's at Google now, and you didn't even need to email him to find out - in fact, you didn't have to ask anyone at all. It allows what used to be your ""peripheral"" social network to play a larger role in your life than it used to. Think of it as a tool to improve your general social ""situational awareness"".<p>[edit] Another strength of Facebook is that you don't have to participate to derive value.

But today I received confirmation that I am following the right career path by working towards one day building a startup.<p>Let me fill you guys in.<p>About a week and a half ago I had an idea to take the freely available information from my university's Student Employment Center (http://www.finaid.wwu.edu/studentjobs/index.php) and create my own site that would let student job hunters actually filter the jobs based on pay rate, on- or off-campus, category, employer, etc... Which the Student Employment center is pretty lacking in. In fact the Student Employment site is pretty lacking in any sort of usability; it is essentially just a list. I decided to focus on catering to what student job hunters need out of a list of jobs. Mainly easy but strong filtering/browsing and usability, usability, usability!<p>I made a quick and dirty site in my free time (http://western-jobs.com) but I didn't finish almost all of the features that I wanted to. Why? Because I realized that the Student Employment site <i>does</i> have some of the main features I wanted to implement (durr) such as automated emails and browsing jobs by category (not pay though) but they are hidden away in the corners of the site. Again, highlighting how it is not very end-user friendly, and lacks usability, but they already had all the eyeballs and I felt defeated.<p>I figured I might as well just throw what I had together and put it out so I could be done with it, and move on to the next thing. So I posted it to the WWU forums (http://forum.wwu.edu/node/4203) and that was that.<p>That was yesterday, today I received a phone call from the head of the Financial Aid department (which runs the Student Employment Center) offering me a job, and we had a good conversation. Unfortunately, due to privacy concerns, they are blocking incoming traffic from my site. No hard feelings, I am not joining their team because I already have an awesome job, but I agreed to sit down with their developers and share my opinions on what their site is lacking, and let them do all the work. Now I can have a positive influence on many more students than I ever could have by running my own site.<p>Sorry, I know this is a bit long but it feels really good to get noticed and receive attention, something that I haven't done with web development yet.<p>This elated feeling I have can't be unique though, so I pose a question: When did you have your moment of confirmation?<p>I'm sure there are some great stories of motivation out there.",1239841202

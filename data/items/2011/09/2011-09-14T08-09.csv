2995433,comment,2995194,2995194,4,0,leoc,,,"> The problem with standing is that when you raise desk height for keyboard/mouse use you need to also raise screen height above the desk or you get neck flexion. Also, for standing computer work the computer fixes the persons posture there is greater wrist extension and pretty soon people end up leaning which also compromises their wrist posture, thereby increasing the risks of a musculoskeletal disorder like carpal tunnel syndrome.<p>I don't understand this. In a proper sit-and-stand configuration the torso, arms and head ought to be in almost exactly the same position relative to the monitor, keyboard and table whether the user is sitting or standing, no?",1315990726

It appears that even though this code looks and quacks like C++/CLI, it actually isn't:<p><i>""In this example, you will immediately notice some keywords that are not part of standard C++. Visual C++ defines a few Component Extensions that, in a Metro style app,are essentially syntactic sugar over the underlying COM calls involved in creating and consuming Windows Runtime types.</i><p><i>""If you are familiar with C++/CLI, you will notice that the Component Extensions look very similar to C++/CLI syntax. However, in a Metro style app or Windows Runtime component, all the C++ code is native. The /Zw compiler option causes the Component Extensions to be compiled for Windows Runtime. The /cli compiler option causes them to be compiled for C++/CLI. Currently, C++/CLI is not supported for Metro style apps.""</i><p>(Source: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh454076(v=VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh45407...</a> )<p>I'm fairly confused now.

There are quite a lot of LP tools, many of them being independent from the language.<p>However, LP is not about tools. I've written LP programs that don't need any extra tool[1]. Rather, LP is about putting the documentation (spec, requirements, etc) at the highest level, and make the code a sublevel of that. This is very different from the traditional approaches where code is the highest level, or where documentation and code are separate.<p>[1] This worked because the build script was part of the literate program, too.

It sounds ultra cliched, but if you value success solely by income then you are likely doomed to run the hedonic treadmill and will forever unhappily compare yourself to others. American culture does not really have a framework for other modes of living, which is why so many people fall into the 'income comparison trap.'<p>You can spend months/years/decades delving into this question, but as a starter I would recommend checking out Eckhart Tolle's book, ""The Power of Now."" I don't recommend many books on spirituality since most of them are full of pseudo-scientific garbage, but PoN is a good one for the practical mindfulness tips it gives.<p>I would respectfully not recommend that you move to a lower income community just so you can be the top earner; this is merely putting a band-aid on the problem, and from a practical standpoint your neighbors will likely be less able to help you personally/professionally.",1315990000

Each individual road data (""The road is called main street"", ""Main St. is 200m long"", ""The top corner of main street is at X deg North, Y deg West"", etc.) is just a little fact, and itself is not copyrightable. However if you collect all those uncopyrightable facts together into one database/collection, then that database/collection might be a copyrightable work.<p>Tracing street/road positions from aerial imagery may or may not be making a derived work. It may or may not be similar to your 'photograph of a paining'. This sort of thing is important for OpenStreetMap and tracing from aerial imagery. However in that project, we avoid legal gray areas and just don't trace from aerial imagery without permission.<p>But when it comes to copyrights, IANAL, lots of this is decided by case law in courts, it varies from country to country, and you should get a lawyer if you need better answers.",1315989936

2995379,comment,2994847,2994847,1,0,pavlov,,,"This really is a completely new user-level API. There's no trace of traditional Win32 concepts: no window handles, no window classes, no event loop... (Yes, no more WPARAM and LPARAM either. Goodbye 1985!)<p>For years Microsoft has been trying to come up with a successor for Win32. This looks like the most credible attempt yet.<p>I don't think this API will be accessible from standard C/C++, though. All the code samples require Microsoft's C++/CLI dialect.<p>For example, here's what <i>main.cpp</i> looks like for one of the app samples that uses a Direct3D view:<p><pre><code>  #include ""DirectXViewProvider.h""

  [Platform::MTAThread] 
  int main(array<Platform::String^>^) 
  { 
      auto directXViewProviderFactory = ref new DirectXViewProviderFactory(); 
      Windows::ApplicationModel::Core::CoreApplication::Run(directXViewProviderFactory); 
      return 0; 
  }
</code></pre>
It's certainly a great improvement over the old WinMain() and running your own event loop. However, those ^ symbols indicate managed CLI objects. When these are even in the main() function signature, it suggests that C++/CLI is a hard requirement.<p>I'm not sure how this will affect other compilers on Windows. AFAIK, Visual C++ is the only compiler with C++/CLI compatibility. Will it be impossible to build full apps using GCC on Windows 8?",1315989373

However, should you require any complex logic without js and its practically inevitable, that youll end up essentially writing not one, but <i>two</i>, separate frontends  one client-side and one server-side.<p>To have transparent support for client-side and server-side applications otherwise, is a rather complex task. The only way to do it <i>and</i> handle any kind of complexity is to use server-side continuations to <i>emulate</i> client-side widgets. This means either using an intermediate layer instead of DOM, or coding to DOM and running against DOM server-side. Using continuations of course has its own set of issues  the state for each client has to be tracked and kept server-side (and one client may have several states), and it means that practically nothing can be cached (everything becomes dynamic). And with all of that trouble and added complexity, what are the benefits? Do we really need to support non-js clients to <i>that</i> degree? Not to mention, that there is practically no web-framework, in mainstream use, that gets it right.<p>And indeed, the alternative version that Gmail provides is much more simplistic, and by the way, it does not make any use of graceful degradation/progressive enhancement  it loads an entirely different Gmail frontend.

Because it occurred at the same time there is no way to decouple whether lowering the marginal tax rate or creating barriers for tax shelters caused money to flow from tax shelters.  (most likely there is an academic paper out there on this, but I do not have one)<p>2) Increasing the tax rate may cause people to stay in some securities sometimes, but for the vast majority of institutional investors this increase in tax rate will have no effect on decision making since the majority of investors in these funds are 401K investments that are not taxable.<p>For the taxable investors, this becomes an issue, but the vast majority of funds still have a lot of churn which indicates that your formula doesn't matter.<p><a href=""http://www.smartmoney.com/invest/strategies/the-taxing-side-of-mutual-funds-17616/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smartmoney.com/invest/strategies/the-taxing-side-...</a>",1318201084

3091548,comment,3091269,3091269,2,0,cydonian_monk,,,"Unfortunately, the only way anyone can know for sure is to die.  The scientist and engineer in me says ""nothing"" happens, that you won't know you're dead because consciousness stops and is never recovered.  That these ""paranormal"" cases are creations of a machine that can't accept the nothingness of its demise.  That a belief in life after death is also a construction to allow us to die with dignity and without fear.  That ""Near-Death"" experiences are the result of the memory-recording portion of our brain continuing while the brain stem and other parts have failed.<p>Still, a part of me says no.  No way.  That something continues.  This other part of me wants to believe.  It reminds me that I've experienced things that can't be explained by the above science.  As have countless others.<p>If there really is a part of ""us"" separate from the brain, as suggested by this article, then our ""soul,"" if you will, must live in the ""cloud"" with our brain operating as some sort of radio.  I've not seen hard physical evidence of anything of the sort.  (But if it's true, God help us if we learn the API.)<p>Near-Death Experiences are a curious subject, and one that deserves real examination.  Ages ago (in high school), I attempted to base a research paper on NDEs.  Finding sources from medical research was impossible, as there weren't any.  The subject was strictly reserved to ""New Age Mysticism,"" and ignored by practitioners for reasons of career self preservation.  Not much seems to have changed.",1318200803
3091547,comment,3091241,3091241,2,0,mojaam,,,"Great point on people being terrible predictors of their own happiness. Their own future for that matter. I think it really depends on how much of an optimist or pessimist you are at the time.<p>If you're being an optimist, you may tend to get inspired and get fuel to make what you've just predicted a reality but should you fail and keep failing (most likely because of the ""impact bias"" mentioned), you start to lose that motivation after a while.<p>If you're being pessimistic when predicting your happiness/future, well it's pretty much impossible. It might be easier to predict a pessimistic future like an unemployed person might say something along the lines of ""Today, I'm going to stay at home all day since the economy/I suck anyways"" and by the end of the day, that plan can easily become the reality you've imagined.<p>Basically, you have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Come to think of it, I'm quoting another Steve Jobs quote which sums it up quiet nicely:<p>""You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

I was just trying to express that the current crop of tools is nowhere near a level of maturity where you could recommend one or the other as a no-brainer.<p><i>Could it be you made the wrong design decisions both times?</i><p>Surely. More so with puppet than with chef as the puppet language offers slightly
more rope to hang yourself on the foot. However, I'm quite confident we have maxed out both tools to about the best of their abilities now (short of the more esoteric extensions such as mcollective). There is of course always a next step, but I can't think of something that could potentially change my perception of their respective problem areas (which, as I outlined in my parent post, are pretty fundamental for each tool).<p><i>Can you give more details like how many serves you have?</i><p>Largest puppet deployment is ~70 hosts, largest chef is ~40 hosts.<p>Yes, we've had to migrate the puppetmaster to a pretty beefy host. Yes, chef's claim to scalability is a joke. We experimented with couch replication but quickly went back to running separate (beefy) chef-servers and sync'ing them via git.<p>A tangential reason for running separate puppetmaster/chef instances is the lack of a trustworthy security model in both. Extdata/databags <i>do</i> occasionally contain sensitive information, neither puppet nor chef accounts for that (don't get me started on ""encrypted databags"").<p><i>Do you have a complex combination of hardware(physical + virtual) and operating system platforms?</i><p>We run (only) debian on physical and cloud servers. For cloud deployments chef works better for us. For physical servers we're rooted in puppet but slowly leaning towards chef for uniformity. I wouldn't say our deployments are especially complex. And even if they were then that'd be no excuse for the tools that were created to manage precisely that kind of complexity.<p><i>Did you migrate from the ""hairball nest of Bash and Perl that holds your data center together"" or did you build your infra from scratch with puppet/chef?</i><p>The bigger clusters were built from scratch but we have chef/puppet clusters in various states of finesse.<p>Oh, this reminds me of one of the less obvious issues that I forgot in my initial rant: Updates.<p>You absolutely, positively want to either update your entire cluster (all puppet/chef clients) in lockstep with the server or not at all. The ""backwards compatibility""-claims didn't work out for us when we tried.",1318200336

So I'm not surprised to see that it can be a little shaky.<p>I also looked at cfengine3, and I liked the language, although I am not a fan of the ""promise/promiser"" terminology, the concept is consistently applied and as a result the language grammar is much simpler than puppet's.  It basically came down to not being able to really choose between puppet and cfengine3 without actually trying them, and since I cared less about identifying the optimal tool than just getting stuff done I selected puppet arbitrarily.<p>I rejected bcfg2 mainly because it seemed very server-oriented and although there was documentation for setting up the system there wasn't a lot of documentation about how to actually configure systems.  I've revisited bcfg2 lately and the situation doesn't seem to have improved much. (eg I can't find a decent reference for the configuration language anywhere online.  There's no equivalent to that puppet page that lists all the data types.)  I also think the choice for XML as the configuration language is suboptimal but I could probably work with it.<p>So we went with puppet, and although I left the position several months later (for unrelated reasons) we were already hitting some of those issues you mentioned.<p>Incidentally, you don't even need the daemon to run puppet, so long as you're willing apply your own security model and distribution method (rsync over ssh, etc/).",1318197913

18549,comment,18363,18413,0,0,scaz,,,"SoftLayer is indeed very good.  The virtual LAN is awesome - you can even setup a PPTP VPN connection and access your virtual LAN from it.  <p>VPN in your gateway box at home and it is almost like having the servers in the other room.  They don't charge you anything for data that goes over the VPN, so you can upload/download from your server without using your bandwidth quota - it is a great for pulling off site backups.\n",1178070901

Lucky for you kind souls post here offering invites for nothing.  Unlucky for you I'm not one of them.  This time you have to work for it.<p>I want you to go through the demo on ourdoings.com and give useful feedback.  If more than five people give feedback I'll pick the five most useful.  ""Useful"" is defined as matching the feedback I'm getting from my actively-posting users, or that I imagine would help them.<p>The target market for ourdoings.com is people who have a lot of photos but little time to share/organize.  Parents with lots of kid photos is one example.  Travlers are another.  This isn't a social networking site for photography enthusiasts; it's designed for speed and simplicity.<p>I know there are people who frequent news.yc and are in the child-rearing phase of life.  You know exactly what this is about, and I really hope that both of you give feedback.  For the rest of you who see this as a boring site for old people, just think of all the fun you'll have with your iminlikewithyou invite.<p><a href=""http://ourdoings.com/"">http://ourdoings.com/</a>\n",1178069597

18541,comment,18531,18538,0,0,jward,,,"The killer features I see with Silverlight is it's ability to run javascript four orders of magnitude faster than the current average browser.  Firefox 3 is apparently taking Adobe's ECMA script engine which kicks the speed up a few notches, but for browsers on the market, this is amazing.<p>The other one that makes me giddy is the fact that Silverlight can control the DOM outside of its shell... and I can code in Python.",1178069155

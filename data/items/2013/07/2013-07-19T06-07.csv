This just goes to show how dumb the kids have become in California&#x27;s school systems.  I went back to school this past year to change careers into health care.  I took a year of pre-reqs at a local community college, and then this class as a pre-req for my program.<p>It is shockingly absurd how easy and dumbed down they make classes in California&#x27;s lower echelon schools.  They basically hand you everything you need to know on every test on a silver platter: you don&#x27;t need to read the book; they give you a study guide and EXPLICITLY tell you what will and will not be on the test; they sometimes will outright give you the exam questions, and students STILL screw that up.  I took an abnormal psychology class where the instructor gave EVERYONE the exam questions, and students STILL did not show up for the exam or got questions wrong.  I was like, HOW THE HELL IS THIS EVEN HAPPENING???!?!<p>I don&#x27;t find this system of learning at fault.  I find the students at fault.  I think they should fail these kids as a costly lesson: study or lose out on $2000 bones.  Bunch of nit wits.",1374217037

Some interesting ideas, which may or not be things Jaron is trying to say:<p>* Externalizing risk is a killer strategy for limited-liability corporations, since they can privatize their gains and socialize their bankruptcies, and really for whoever can get away with it; and many more people can get away with it with sufficient compute power.  (He uses Maxwell&#x27;s Demon and the Landau limit as a simile for this, but I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s productive either for producing new insights that are likely to be true or for helping people understand his point.)<p>* Contributions to social networks and commons-based peer production (Linux, Wikipedia, Facebook) are distributed in a sort of crudely Gaussian way, but value extraction from them is instead distributed in a fat-tailed winner-take-all distribution, which will destroy the middle class.<p>* We are moving our core engines of value production out of the economy.  Jaron thinks this is bad, while I think it&#x27;s way overdue.<p>* Jaron seems to be arguing that universal computers, which can trivially copy information and keep the fact that you have a copy of it secret from other people, are incompatible with any semblance of democracy.  This is an interesting proposition, but it seems dubious to me.",1374216683

Many non-profit groups do manage to differ from businesses by not focusing entirely on the bottom line.<p>There are definitely non-profits with really high administrator and executive compensation that don&#x27;t spend money optimally to meet their stated goals. I&#x27;m interested in discussing the degree to which colleges resemble this type of non-profit.<p>What are all the high tuitions being used for, and how efficiently are they being used? To start to answer that question, I think I need to understand more about the goals of non-profit colleges and who sets most of the policy (high-paid administration? professors?).<p>My guess would be the high-paid administration, which definitely seems to be a problem.",1374216655

6068687,comment,6067152,6068210,2,0,ximeng,,,"What software do you use for note-taking? I also have a surface pro and am also very happy with it despite a few minor problems. For me there is occasional poor response to multitouch scrolling on the touchpad, and sometimes the cursor stops responding to the touchpad until I press escape. Also no middle click on the touchpad is annoying, no right ctrl bugs me, and not having separate pgup, home etc. keys is not convenient. Nowhere to put the pen when charging either. I hope at least some of these problems will be resolved by driver updates, e.g. nothing to stop Fn+F acting as Ctrl+F.<p>Despite the above, the specs, design and portability of the surface pro were better than anything I found when buying it . I get a tablet while still being able to work, which for me requires access to MS software including office. It&#x27;s comparable with ultrabooks but with the stylus support and detachable keyboard it&#x27;s just about in a league of its own, though some products are close nothing seemed as well designed, featureful or portable at the price.",1374216422

Yes, there is a problem with &quot;power law distributions&quot; of content like Google and App Store, but that needs to be changed by allowing customization, making of lists, and aggregation - I appreciate this insight<p>My rant on the subject:<p>I think he is fighting the future. Instead of total tracking and micropayments for everything, why don&#x27;t we make a flat copyright tax and distribute it by popularity of content? It would be so much less overhead - we only need to track the number of views and divide.<p>Instead of trying to maintain monetization as it was in the past, into the future, why not embrace free culture and go ahead with basic human income? People create for love a creation too, not just for money. I&#x27;d say the best creations are works of love, not just works for money.<p>His power-law vs bell-curve insight is great but I think I got one that is even better (contains his insight and goes deeper still): we need to apply two criteria for improving society<p>1. differentiation - we need to maximize it by empowering creativity; why should we all see the same news? that would make for a monoculture. Instead, we should to pick and choose our feeds, each one of us differently. Similarly, we&#x27;re better off with unique skills, unique perspectives on life and technology, and so on. We should encourage the variety.<p>2. integration - this is complementary to the 1st. The idea is that people need to be brought together to communicate, travel, make commerce and so on. As long as we are integrated, the system self regulates and can better cope with problems.<p>An anecdote: what is the difference between Facebook and Reddit? I&#x27;d say that the main difference is network topology; FB works by keeping you in your bubble of &quot;friends&quot; while reddit always exposes you to new people, on every page - that makes for better integration. The ability to subscribe/unsubscribe from subreddis improves personalization. Also, the comment history makes each user differentiated because the user will reply to different people. That&#x27;s why we have such a higher level of creativity and participation in reddit compared to FB, that&#x27;s why people get involved in deeper, more thoughtful discussions on reddit - it has more differentiation and integration.<p>Disclosure: I didn&#x27;t invent this integration-differentiation idea. It comes from Giulio Tononi&#x27;s Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness (I reused the concepts on society instead of the brain).

Without explanation it seems hypocritical to me, since you would not know about those NSA activites without Snowden.<p>> That said, I find that whenever I get out of the Hacker News hivemind, and deal with any of my friends from around the world who have actually lived and worked in multiple countries, and especially those friends who have children of their whose futures the friends are working for, there is remarkably little regard of Snowden as a hero or a freedom-fighter.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that you do not have friends from Germany. Having suffered through multiple surveillance states in the past, Germans are very much aware of the dangers that are caused by massive surveillance. New technologies enable surveillance in an amount that has never been seen in history before. If your friends do not seem to care, they just haven&#x27;t realised that there is a sword dangling right above their heads.
Why do you think that <i></i>every<i></i> single constitution of &quot;free countries&quot; (and also the human rights) have passages about the confidelity of spoken words, the confidelity of messages and so on. This is no coincidence. So many people paid with their lives for it. It is the only way of making sure that a democracy stays a democracy. You cannot organize an opposition, if the current rulers know all your moves, all your communications and all your contacts. This has been proven in history again and again, yet this is vital for a healthy democracy. Yet people seem to forget, because they &quot;have nothing to hide&quot; or their &quot;life is not affected&quot;. But guess what, once you are affected, it is already too late and nothing can be done anymore. I would not want my children to live in a fascist surveillance state and I am very grateful for Snowden actions. Please talk to your friends and try to raise awareness. It&#x27;s their children or their children&#x27;s children who will have to pay the price. I know it&#x27;s a little abstract, that&#x27;s exactly why people fall for it again and again.",1374214927

Sometimes, I even decide the vaccine isn&#x27;t necessary, or worth the risk (gasp!), even though I am aware of the fact that I don&#x27;t have enough data to make a proper informed decision. In the absence of data, I often plan for the worst reasonable case. I&#x27;m aware that I may be a little bit too skeptical. That&#x27;s too bad. If you find that prospect terrifying for you or your children, then I advise you to find a better way to communicate, or find a way to make all of the data that one needs for a proper decision available. I advise everyone else who gives a crap to do the same.<p>[1] <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004879.pub4/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004879...</a>

Initially it was found that these experts could recall surprising amounts of information, far more than non-experts, suggesting eidetic skills. However, when the experts were presented with arrangements of chess pieces that could never occur in a game, their recall was no better than the non-experts, suggesting that they had developed an ability to organize certain types of information, rather than possessing innate eidetic ability.<p>Scientific skepticism about the existence of eidetic memory was fueled around 1970 by Charles Stromeyer who studied his future wife Elizabeth, who claimed that she could recall poetry written in a foreign language that she did not understand years after she had first seen the poem. She also could, apparently, recall random dot patterns with such fidelity as to combine two patterns into a stereoscopic image. She remains the only person documented to have passed such a test. However, the methodology of the testing procedures used is questionable (especially given the extraordinary nature of the claims being made) as is the fact that the researcher married his subject, and that the tests have never been repeated (Elizabeth has consistently refused to repeat them) raises further concerns.</i><p>> <i>With the questionable exception of Elizabeth (discussed above), as of 2008, no one claiming to have long-term eidetic memory has been able to prove this in scientific tests. There are a number of individuals with extraordinary memory who have been labeled eidetickers, but many use mnemonics and other, non-eidetic memory enhancing exercises. </i><p>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory</a>",1374214012

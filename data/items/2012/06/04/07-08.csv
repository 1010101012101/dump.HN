4063080,comment,4062695,4062955,3,0,lloeki,,,"Interpreting various equations from my limited knowledge of such a discussed area, I've come up with this:<p>Hawking radiation makes a black hole lose mass, hence diminishing its Schwarzchild radius. The Schwarzchild radius came up because it's a singularity (in the mathematical sense) in a solution to Einstein filed equations. The same way matter collapses onto itself up to creating such a singularity and being encompassed into the now existing event horizon, as soon as there is not enough mass to sustain the singularity, the event horizon vanishes, hence the remaining matter ""pops"" back into our sight.<p>You could view it otherwise with a thought experiment: take particles out of the black hole one by one. Each time it will reduce the mass and maybe the radius. At some point the mass/radius ratio may not be small enough to hold light and the bubble bursts in plain sight as the event horizon breaks down. In such a thought experiment, the worst case would be that the black hole would require every single particle but one to evaporate (unless you assume a single particle could be a black hole in itself).<p>An interesting back of the envelope calculation is computing the mass contained in a Schwartzchild radius of Planck length (the size at which quantum effects take over).<p><pre><code>    l_P = sqrt(hG/c^3)\n    r_s = 2Gm/c^2\n</code></pre>\nhence m = sqrt(hc/4G) = 1.0882546265651108e-08 kg which is a bit more than 1e22 electrons sitting at a position 1e-15 smaller than a single one of them.",1338796727

For example, high up my list of text which is burned into my memory is the opening of Espedair Street by Iain Banks:<p><i>""Two days ago I decided to kill myself. I would walk and hitch and sail away from this dark city to the bright spaces of the wet west coast, and there throw myself into the tall, glittering seas beyond Iona (with its cargo of mouldering kings) to let the gulls and seals and tides have their way with my remains, and in my dying moments look forward to an encounter with Staffas six-sided columns and Fingals cave; or I might head south to Corryvrecken, to be spun inside the whirlpool and listen with my waterlogged deaf ears to its mile-wide voice ringing over the wave-race; or be borne north, to where the white sands sing and coral hides, pink-fingered and hard-soft, beneath the ocean swell, and the rampart cliffs climb thousand-foot above the seething acres of milky foam, rainbow-buttressed.<p>Last night I changed my mind and decided to stay alive. Everything that follows is . . . just to try and explain.""</i><p>When I'm in a bookshop I sometimes find a copy of Espedair Street and read that again, even though I have at least two copies at home.",1338796584

This section of the street has many shops, and all I can imagine was that shop owners wanted fewer obstructions in front of their stores. However, the result as I see it, was to make the area much less pleasant to stroll through, and more barren when seen from afar.<p>Urban trees help create a sense of shelter and alter the character of light (shade, filtered, and dappled), significantly lowering the temperature of otherwise paved areas. They can create a more park-like atmosphere, encouraging people to seek out a place and linger in it, enjoying its relaxing qualities. So one would think this would not only be a benefit for residential neighborhoods, but also retail/commercial ones. Downtown Palo Aalto for instance.<p>But in this case, low tree density correlates to a high degree of conservative small town environmental and architectural ignorance and/or political ineptitude.

However, through shell corporations, they threaten to sue others.  This motivates their targets to participate in the IV pools and IV takes a cut.<p>This idea of threatening enforcement where the patent holder has no intent to ever manufacture is not something new.  But no one ever liked it when it happened.  That's because it serves no apparent purpose in bringing products to the market.<p>What makes IV unique is that Myrvold used his own money to start IV and start acquiring patents from patent holders in bulk.  This was no small investment.  His idea is to make trolling a business.  Instead of trying to fix a problem, he has opted to exacerbate it for his own profit.  He is engaging in exactly the type of conduct companies like the one he worked for had to be in constant fear of: the small inventor who will never be successful in the marketplace but who has received some patents that she can, at her discretion, enforce against some large companies that are successful in the marketplace.<p>For an interesting approach to how patents might be used, consult the history of Hans Bessemer.  He produced some of the most valuable intellectual property in America's history.  He made Carnegie the world's wealthiest individual.<p>Also, note that Paul Allen, one of the wealthiest men on the planet, tried some pure patent trolling a number of years ago.  Why?  He failed miserably.  But what drives someone to try this?",1338794612

This would ensure that the only software that could run on a machine was specifically authorized by the user.  In addition, there would be no worry with regards to leaked keys, because the risk of key exposure is a single machine.<p>Unfortunately, secure boot is not about preventing the spread of malware.  It's about securing the computer from you, the owner.  It's about DRM, and ensuring that the code running on a computer (e.g. Blu-Ray player) is controlled and trusted by a third-party, who is then able to dictate how certain information available to the machine is processed.<p>Don't let the name fool you.",1338794428

I would ponder: is the next action ""go to the studio"",or is it ""turn on the computer"", or is it ""mix the song"" or is it ""organize the drum tracks."" In my understanding (which was probably wrong) one idea of GTD was to break complex tasks down and represent them with a next step. I never found this helpful, as I always new what the next step was.

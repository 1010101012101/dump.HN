5644151,comment,5641799,5641799,2,0,patrickk,,,"Quote from Peter Thiel starting around 39:10 in the video:<p>""<i>Mean wages have been stagnant (not median). Its not an income an inequality issue. Mean wages went up 350% in the US after inflation from 1933 and 1973. [They] went up 22% from 1973 to 2013. Median wages were flat, so its become more unequal. Even if you had redistributed everything, its gone up only 22%.</i>""<p>I feel this is an overly US-centric view of humanities progress. Globalisation produces winners and losers in the short term, and even though manufacturing jobs are being destroyed in the US, millions of people are being lifted out of poverty in China and other low cost developing nations.<p>If you are using the argument that stagnant wages in one part of the world means human civilisation is not progressing technologically, does that argument stand up if you look at global living standards?<p>There was an interesting argument (unfortunately I can't recall where I heard it) that put forward the idea that World War II was like a massive subsidy from the US Air Force to the US manufacturing sector. The US Air Force destroyed many of the industrial cities of America's global manufacturing competitors (mainly Germany and Japan) and other major European nations were destroyed also and were bailed out with the Marshall Plan.<p>All this meant that for decades, the US manufacturing sector had it artificially good because of greatly reduced global competition, as factories and other manufacturing infrastructure had to be totally rebuilt in the other big industrial nations, which took decades. This was great news for US car companies (and other manufacturers) in the decades after the war, who could churn out (relatively) unreliable and fuel inefficient vehicles, which were bought in huge numbers as they were the best available. In the 1970s, the combination of the oil shocks and encroaching competition from Japanese car makers, who innovated with reliable, fuel efficient and affordable vehicles, meant that the good times were over.<p>Tl;dr using US wages from 1933-1973, and 1973-today is the wrong metric to measure human civilisations technological progress, for a variety of reasons.",1367499473

This form of semi-gender-balance is not uncommon; many supporting roles (HR,etc) tend to skew female. As a female developer, I find the technology differential between the genders to be at least as awkward as having a strong but more uniform gender skew across the company would be.<p>Without any individual behaving incorrectly in any way, it feels awkward to be the only technical female in a company. Having a non-zero number of other women present is better than none, but it's completely different from having a non-zero number of equally technical women. When the information flow of technical information is always male-to-female, it just makes me feel uncomfortable, even though no one is doing anything wrong.",1367499411

I do not want to have something on my face and the advantages I see from Glass don't outweigh that desire.<p>For example, I don't see the advantage in being able to photograph things from my head. Sure, you can imagine a situation where having a camera attached to your head is really useful and being able to take an instant photograph would be fantastic, but I'm not ready to pay the price of a thing on my face all the time for that benefit.<p>I can imagine having Glass as a display for a GPS as very helpful.

Designers are easier to find, but not a lot of them code.  That's just my own personal experience plus a general feel for the industry from reading and talking to a few other business owners.  It's funny how it seems like everybody is a programmer or UX designer - until you actually have to hire staff - then suddenly there seems to be none around!  Of course it might be different if I was hiring at Facebook or Google rather than a small tech startup.<p>But anyway, don't confuse my saying I'm an adequate designer to mean that I have no taste or that I produce fugly apps.  Nor am I rotting away in an ancient IT department with no clue about the current state of software development.  I work on a team & we all have our own specialties.

Ultimately, if 90% of developers in the country you're in are male, it's going to be pretty damn hard to keep any kind of balance in your development team. I think you just have to accept that, and continue to hire based on excellence rather than trying to bias towards gender (which is illegal anyway).<p>However, there are completely legal things you can do to try and tilt the balance in other functions, so that at least the company as a whole is balanced. For example, advertising on sites that aren't themselves predominantly male, and wording your job ads so that they make it clear that women are most welcome, helps to tilt the balance of applicants, which allows you to maintain the company balance while still hiring the best applicants.<p>I don't think you can solve macro-societal issues like gender balance among software developers in general just by tweaking your hiring process (though I'll be happy to be proven wrong), but that's not an issue of sexism, just an issue of reality.<p>I haven't yet considered how you'd solve that problem at huge scales, like if you were Microsoft - probably others might have more useful opinions on this.

I visited Puerto Rico in February and decided on a T-Mobile stick because the one I use in Budapest works perfectly.  In PR, though, there were URLs that simply didn't go through - and there is literally no support.  None; you simply can't get support at all.  No phone, no email - just a ""community support"" forum where you can post things if you feel like blowing off steam.  And it still cost $10/GB.<p>Not only that, you can only purchase a new block of 5 GB <i>after</i> your current one has already been used up.  Before then they simply don't take your money - unless you set up autopay.  And you can't purchase time online, because the URL forwards to nowhere - see above lack of any support facility.  You can't even report this breakage.<p>So you have to do it by phone.  But there are two systems; first you have to load money onto your account, then you can use the money on your account to pay for a new 5GB block - but these are two different systems with two different numbers and they each require you to punch in your phone number and a PIN code.  Different PIN codes, if I recall.  And again, no human support at all.<p>But then let me tell you about our T-Mobile cell phones here in Budapest.  My phone started sending me ""premium"" SMS messages at 1500 ft a pop (about $7.50 per premium message) until the entire balance was used up.  As service messages so they don't show in the Inbox.  T-Mobile was able to block that, but my wife's phone started mysteriously ""accessing the Internet"" (it's not a smart phone), again at something like 500 ft per access, invisibly, until her balance was used up.  The only recourse is to go to a T-Mobile store and stand in line for half an hour, because they do kind of have phone support here in Hungary, but the only thing they can tell you is to go to the store and wait in line.<p>The store has no permission to escalate to technicians.  The people in the store ""disabled"" Internet on my wife's phone three separate times; the theft continued each time.  Sometimes they'd refund some money and apologize and swear up and down that everything was disabled.<p>Finally, it seems to have stopped on its own.  Maybe it was a system misconfiguration, maybe not.  It's impossible to know, because clearly T-Mobile itself has no idea.<p>Their Internet stick (in Hungary) works great, though.  So I continue to use them - it's just that if there's ever a problem they are entirely unable to fix it.  The entire company is so Balkanized and so incredibly poorly managed that they can only barely function if nothing goes wrong.",1367497754

We're in 2013 today, things have, thankfully, moved forward a bit.<p>I think if you look at the world today, there are still definitely some issues with institutional sexism, but I do not think they are any more salient in technology than anywhere else. If anything, I'd say tech (at least in the UK) has a pro-female bias, because there are fewer women in the hiring pool, and so if you don't make a deliberate effort to keep your team balanced you'll end up with a sausage fest. In the case of GrantTree, that meant making a deliberate effort to advertise in places which are not predominantly male, and to tweak the wording of our job ads to make it clear that women are very welcome to apply.<p>Last but not least...<p><i>This is sexism by any definition, presumably perpetrated mostly or entirely accidentally, and not by ""jerks"".</i><p>You can be a jerk unconsciously. Surely, most people are - I don't think anyone actively wants to be a jerk. If you look inside your mind and you spot a belief, especially one that you've acted on, that ""women can't be as good as men at X"", where X is any kind of activity practiced by a large number of men and women, then there's a bit of a jerk in you.<p>There are differences between men and women, and some things men are naturally better at on average (for example, world-class competitive sports where the amount of testosterone in your blood simply makes a big difference in your ultimate performance), but no job I've ever seen advertised touches on anything quite so extreme. Even oil rig workers don't need to be world-class weight-lifting champions.<p>Everyone has some aspects of their mind that are ""jerk-like"". What makes someone not a jerk in the long term is the constant re-evaluation of otherwise accepted beliefs (usually handed down by their parents) in the face of new evidence.<p>Again, however, that's not at all specific to technology...",1367497448

For those of you who find all the Haskell impenetrable, let me summarize:<p>1. As raverbashing points out, the key takeaway here is ""removing the impossible and normalizing is equivalent to Bayes rule."" This can be represented in a programming language using a ""die unless X is true"" instruction and some magic behind the scenes. It's nothing more than a trivial generalization of McCarthy's ""AMB"" operator for LISP with some weights attached to each possibility.<p>2. The nicest thing about this approach is that it makes it very easy to reason about probability correctly. For example, the Monty Hall problem, which is known for being counter-intuitive, can be stated very clearly with all the assumptions visible.<p>3. The original audience of this post was programming language designers and people who understand Haskell and monads. For everybody else, I'd like to apologize for the notation. ""Simple"" is relative, and in this post, I take a lot of background knowledge for granted.<p>4. To implement this idea, you can choose between several approaches: explicit enumeration of all possibilities (which explodes exponentially), particle systems, or weighted particle systems. The latter two would be ideally compiled down to GPU code for big problems. Unfortunately, you can't use either Kalman filters or modern Bayesian network solvers, which somewhat limits the usefulness of this approach. Basically, it will scale to lots of data points, but not to complex Bayesian networks.<p>5. Dealing with different false-positive and false-negative rates would add a couple lines of code to this example.<p>If you'd like a more detailed writeup of this idea, see: <a href=""http://www.randomhacks.net/darcs/probability-monads/probability-monads.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randomhacks.net/darcs/probability-monads/probabil...</a> I'll be back online in a couple of hours and I'll be happy to answer any further questions.",1367496917

Ideally they should be using glyphs with much bolder lines, or if they're really set on using the current ones, place each on a solid white circle. Right now they blend in with the text and seem to add to the overall visual noise.<p>Scrolling down the page, why the hell am I looking at a gigantic picture of a girl staring back at me? That image would be better placed on an interior decorating portfolio, not a city council website. Ideally the images shouldn't be so large and vague, but if they're set on using it, they should've overlayed the image with its headline in a large white font (currently relegated to the invisible location of below the image)<p>I have issues with their color scheme too.

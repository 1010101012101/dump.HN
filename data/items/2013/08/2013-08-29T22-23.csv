Google knows a lot about you, and it knows a lot about the people you hang out with and the kinds of things you read and the kinds of things you don&#x27;t read. In knowing all of that stuff they can ascertain that you are part of a community (well a cohort at least) with certain preferences and proclivities, and as soon as a new user identifies as also part of that cohort they can tweak the user experience to &quot;improve&quot; it.<p>And don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does improve. I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;m not bombarded with ads for TJMax on Google properties but think Digikey could back off a bit.<p>From a feedback perspective though it gets weird. And you can see that when you search without any identifying information enabled. I found the whole &#x27;Don&#x27;t Bubble Me&#x27; campaign quite creative.<p>The challenge for search engines though is that being the reference librarian&#x27;s favorite tool for objectiveness doesn&#x27;t woo the mass market.

And that makes this article even more alarming.<p>The problem is that since WWII, the vast majority of these foreign born scientists in the US tended to stay and become naturalized U.S. citizens. It was uncommon, if not rare, for them to leave. In fact, there were waitlists for scientists trying to immigrate _into_ the U.S.<p>The reason for this was very much economic. The U.S., the leader in scientific spending over many decades after WWII, could pay scientists more than how much their home countries could pay. I should also note that in the past, the U.S. was also much more accomodating toward foreign born scientists in regard to naturalization, as well as popular attitude.<p>Now on every other bulletin board in my building, there&#x27;re flyers in Chinese advertising very well-paid positions in China, and I get to read about the growing percentage of climate change deniers and creationists in the U.S almost every other week in the NY Times.",1377817047

Because for a long time users were largely technical, it&#x27;s search for tech stuff has been pretty good for a long time (in general, there are a few sub-categories in that that have lagged[1]).  Where, searching for an author or book might have terrible results.  So, when these people say it has improved, they mean it has improved <i>for the kind of searches that that person does</i>.  As more people use it, and suggest improvements[2], it will approach being good for all kinds of searches.<p>[1] It still isn&#x27;t very good at searching for specific error messages. It definitely used to show obscure projects on GitHub way too often. You&#x27;d do a search for &#x27;getty&#x27; and some 3-commit project with a name containing getty would be the first hit.  Also, I think it&#x27;s actually gotten worse at finding Rails API stuff.<p>[2] It&#x27;s been a while since I tried, but if you tweet at them with a search term with a poor result, they will try to figure out how to tweak the algorithm to make it better.

6299123,comment,6298486,6299090,3,0,gwern,,,"> I think it&#x27;s easier to not be alarmed about foreign-born PhDs returning home (if that is indeed where they go when they leave the us) than if it were US natives leaving, but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s really that much less worrisome.<p>It is a very different situation, and the meaningfulness is likewise different. For a foreign-born PhD holder, they have family back there, they&#x27;ll become bigger fish in a smaller pond, they already know the language, probably have citizenship, are acculturated, may not have kids and wives deeply embedded into American culture & communities, etc. For an American-born PhD holder, most of these will be false. The cost to an American of moving permanently overseas is, on average, going to be vastly higher to them.<p>When you hear of some foreign-born PhD holders on the margin deciding to return home, it&#x27;s no big deal, and is adequately explained by very small shifts in the rewards of being in the US and the rewards of going home. (And a survey means even less.) People simply don&#x27;t want to leave their home countries for very good reasons. Think of how few Jews left Nazi Germany before it was too late, even when the writing was literally on the wall (in the form of anti-semitic graffiti).<p>When you hear of a lot of <i>American</i> scientists leaving America permanently, <i>then</i> it&#x27;s time to start panicking.",1377816251

I love it.<p>I myself just moved to San Francisco ~3 months ago after a lifetime of living within about a 100 mile circle of places on the East coast; a lot of these observations come from this experience.  Ultimately, it&#x27;s been a good experience for me, but it&#x27;s not exactly what I expected from a naive point of view.<p>Packing up and moving your whole life has some pretty serious consequences that are easy to gloss over.  There&#x27;s a big difference between a vacation of a few weeks to a month and actually <i>living</i> somewhere else.<p>Being in SF, for me, meant living in an urban (vs. suburban) environment, which meant a variety of changes.  Hopping in the car to go <i>anywhere</i> is no longer a requirement.  It&#x27;s also not an option if I want to get a load of groceries, unless I want to rent a ZipCar. Am I saying it&#x27;s too hard to walk 2 blocks to the grocery store? No. But it&#x27;s a new way of life.<p>All these changes to your lifestyle can be exciting and fun, but they can also be stressful; especially so if you are (as I am not) socially isolated by language and/or cultural differences.<p>For instance, one thing that was a hassle moving here for me, and would be worse internationally, is ADHD medication.  It&#x27;s a schedule 2 drug in the United States, meaning I can only ever get a month&#x27;s supply, among other restrictions.  So when I got here I had to get a new doctor almost immediately - and most doctors are reluctant to write a controlled substance prescription on demand.<p>Again, I love traveling, and if I was reading this article about a DC company (where I used to live) and I still lived there, I&#x27;d be the first to sign up.<p>But a lot of the differences are subtle, or unexpected, and you should realize that it can be - while enlightening, meaningful, and ultimately fun - a very stressful experience.  It&#x27;s sort of like the difference between telecommuting and working in the office - with google hangouts, teleconferences, etc, the communication should be the same, right?  It&#x27;s the same laptop whether at home or at work, right?  And yet, for me, the experience is massively different.",1377815959

So while it is absolutely true that a junior perl programmer might slowly generate inefficient code and an experienced (lazy) perl programmer might quickly generate optimal perl code, neither of them would produce the same product written in assembly code (or better yet pure machine code).<p>To put that in a different perspective, I once wrote a BASIC interpreter in Java (one of my columns for JavaWorld) and it was pretty quick to do, and yet looking at the &quot;source&quot; to Microsoft BASIC written in 8080 assembler it was not very efficient. But it took Bill a lot longer to write Microsoft BASIC in assembler, and you couldn&#x27;t even <i>begin</i> to port a full up Java VM to the 8080 (let&#x27;s not argue about J2ME).<p>But step back then from that precipice, you have two versions of BASIC, one runs in a Browser and one runs on a 16 line by 64 character TVText S-100 card. (or 24 x 80 CRT terminal). Now you can run the same program in both contexts, unchanged, but the amount of energy you expend to do so varies a lot. So which is more &quot;efficient?&quot; I&#x27;d argue the one written in 8080 assembly is more efficient from a joules per kilo-core-second standpoint. Which was written more quickly? Mine, it only took about a week.<p>That is why talking about efficiency and productivity without getting anally crisp in your definitions can lead to two opposite interpretations of exactly the same statement.<p>[1] I find the lack of a wrist pad to rest on a challenge.",1377815789

A lot of it is just more hardware support and drivers, which is of course only interesting if you have that particular hardware.<p>But some of it is really great new stuff; cgroups for dividing processes up into groups and being able to control them together, monitoring and limiting resources on a whole group basis. Namespaces (user, PID, network, etc), which together with some userspace tools give you containers for lightweight virtualization (this is what trendy things like Docker use to provide you with instant and easy containers for deploying apps). There are a couple of distributed filesystems (Ceph and Lustre) which have landed in the kernel recently, and there&#x27;s btrfs which is developing rapidly as Linux&#x27;s next-gen filesystem, supporting snapshots, checksums, integrated volume management and RAID, and so on. There&#x27;s reshaping support in the software RAID system, allowing you to change RAID layouts on the fly (going from a 2-disk RAID 1 to a 3 disk RAID-5 to a 6 disk RAID-6, say). There are new SSD caching options, allowing you to use both an SSD and large but slow spinning disk, caching random reads and writes on the SSD, getting the best of both worlds. There are new sandboxing tools that give you the ability to run BPF filters on attempted system calls, giving you fine-grained sandboxing support (used by Chrome to better sandbox the renderer).<p>There&#x27;s lots going on in the kernel space if you pay attention. You do have to be interested in infrastructure; if you&#x27;re just interested in applications, you mostly wait until whoever provides your platform (Amazon or Heroku, or Google in the case of Android, or Canonical, or Red Hat) packages these up into a nice, easy to use platform, and you may not ever realize what kernel changes went on underneath to allow these new services.

If you actually look at the number of newcomers showing up in each of the graphs (the 0-1 year bar), you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s generally growing, not shrinking.   And of <i>course</i> over time some people will move on to other projects (example: Jeff Garzik was invited to the Kernel Summit before he started as a freshman at MIT, but he&#x27;s now moved on to work on the bitcoin project).   So you would expect that over time, the number of people in successive generations will start dropping off.   So their analysis is actually quite sloppy as far as I&#x27;m concerned.   If the total number of developers submitting patches is growing, and we have a constant supply of new people joining the project, it&#x27;s all good.<p>Right now, the sense that I get is that companies are having problems finding high quality kernel developers.  So people who are hobbyists and who demonstrate great skill tend not to stay hobbyists for very long; they will get hired, unless they have other reasons for staying put.  (Example: if I had joined Red Hat or SuSE much earlier, before the IPO mania, instead of staying at MIT working on Kerberos and IPSEC and doing standards work for the IETF, and only doing Linux has a hobby until 1999, my financial situation today would probably be quite different; not that I&#x27;m complaining, mind you!  The things that I got to work on while I was MIT was interesting, and I made a conscious choice to stay there.)<p>So to the extent that finding good engineers is hard for many companies, it&#x27;s not surprising that we&#x27;re trying to make sure we can attract new talent.  That being said, those of us who were on the Kernel Summit program committee who decided that doing an explicit call for hobbyists did not consult with Amanda and Angela who decided to hold a Newcomer&#x27;s reception.   There was no grand plan; like many things in the Linux world, we have a decentralized command and control, and this was not the result of any kind of central planning.   The senior engineers on the program committee, and the staff at the LF who have much greater contact with the executives at their member companies may have been reacting to similar observations about the job market for highly skilled developers, but we made our decisions on our own.    So what you saw was emergent behavior; it wasn&#x27;t an conscious decision by any one person to have an integrated campaign.<p>That being said,  a bigger concern I have is not really the greying of the community, but what&#x27;s our next challenge.   We get the most innovation, and new developers (whether they be engineers employed by companies, or hobbyists) when we are responding to a new challenge.   For example, for a while, we had a huge effort making Linux better for enterprise computing and enterprise servers.  That tailed off, and then cloud computing and mobile/embedded Linux started taking off, and folks who had previously worked for HP and IBM have migrated to other companies, and there aren&#x27;t as many people focused on making Linux better for enterprise servers.   So the question is what&#x27;s the next challenge?<p>What part of the I/T industry will Linux be disrupting next?   What interesting technical problems will there be for us to tackle as engineers?   What business opportunities will cause companies to increase their investment in Linux, and thus hire engineers to work on improving Linux so they can make a healthy return on their investment?   What new set of companies will be the next generation of platinum sponsors for the Linux Foundation?<p>The opportunity to make Linux better-suited for the cloud and mobile/embedded computing won&#x27;t last forever.  So long as we can find that next opportunity, I&#x27;m really not worried about the health of the Linux kernel development community.   We will continue to have technically interesting challenges, which will keep the hobbyists and as well as professional engineers engaged; and there will be opportunities to make money, which will keep companies continuing to invest in Linux, and people like me employed.   :-)",1377815077

Illinois - 6.1
Michigan - 7.1
Louisiana - 12.4 (!)<p>States with lax gun laws:
Montana - 1.8
Idaho - 2.5
North Dakota - 1.3<p>Now, admittedly, I cherry picked those to prove a point that you can blur the numbers to show what you want them to show, and I can just as easily pick numbers from strict gun law states with really low numbers and states with historically lax laws with higher numbers.  We could go back and forth all day long like that, but I think that this paper, or whatever it is does make a pretty valid point which is that gun control doesn&#x27;t really have the desired effect.  Whether you look at entire countries, or individual states or municipalities, you will always find examples of strict gun laws with lots of violence, and no gun laws with almost no violence, and vice versa. We really just need to take a step back and realize that we are coming at this violence problem the wrong way and that the time, energy, and money we keep using to push for tighter gun control, is all wasted on something that likely would not work, and we&#x27;re taking all those resources away from research we <i>should</i> be doing to find a <i>real</i> solution to the problem.<p>Links for the numbers I found:

6298952,comment,6298264,6298264,70,0,accelanon,,,"My experience was not nearly this bad, but still horrifying for me, my co-founder, and our families.<p>We had been talking off and on with an accelerator for about a month. We had pitched them, had a few calls, but lived on the other side of the country. They wanted to meet in person which was really not feasible for us. We worked at full-time jobs while hacking away on the side and scraping together whatever money we had to fund our company.<p>A little flashback, first: I had dropped out of grad school and taught myself programming to start my first company. After a year of living on my wife&#x27;s student loans, I got &quot;acquihired&quot; by a startup that was run by one of the accelerator&#x27;s mentors. They gave me 3% equity, a $10k moving bonus, $15k for the company, and a $75k/year salary. I said yes.<p>Three months later, I decided to quit. I was the only technical person in a company consisting of the two non-technical co-founder, co-CEOs, a project manager, and myself. They had burned through $700k already and hadn&#x27;t built anything yet. It was becoming clear that my product was going to be their product. In the best case scenario I would spend the next four years working on my original startup, only now for pennies on the dollar.<p>The purchase of my assets still hadn&#x27;t gone through and I hadn&#x27;t yet been paid, aside from the moving bonus and salary. The co-founders claimed I had acted in bad faith and asked for the moving bonus back. I explained that I wouldn&#x27;t have moved had the moving bonus not been offered (as I couldn&#x27;t have afforded it). If they had wanted that money back in case I quit, our contract should have specified as much. They relented, and we went our separate ways.<p>Fast forward another year, back to our accelerator story. The accelerator decides they want to afford us the opportunity to meet in person. They agree to pay for flights so long as we pay for our own hotels and car rental. We also have to talk up the trip on social media, talking about how they paid for our trip, our meetings with investors, etc. Small price to pay, we think.<p>We make the trip and have some pretty productive meetings. They seem to like us. We fly back, and after some back and forth, they decide they want to invest. Of course, they still need to do their due diligence, so it&#x27;s going to take some time. In the meantime, my co-founder and I get fired from our jobs. You see, our boss found out about our trip to the accelerator since it was broadcast over social media. It was cool when we were working on a startup after hours. It wasn&#x27;t so cool when we were talking openly about actually starting a company.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter, though. We made it into the accelerator. They send over the paperwork. It&#x27;s a convertible note with pretty standard terms, fully signed by all the partners. We sign and send it back. We can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s happening. I sign a lease on an apartment in the new city and my wife and I pack up our apartment. My co-founder does the same.<p>Suddenly the music changes. They go dark for a couple days. I&#x27;m nervous because I have a U-Haul scheduled. I finally get a call with one of the partners; I&#x27;m supposed to start a 3,000 mile move the next day. He explains that they can&#x27;t do the deal. A check isn&#x27;t coming. He can&#x27;t explain why.<p>My mind races and I think: it couldn&#x27;t have been that mentor, could it? My resume was fully transparent. They should&#x27;ve seen the connection. And they did their due diligence before they made the deal. How could that have slipped by?<p>I ask for an explanation but to no avail. They can&#x27;t explain it. Not even a little bit.<p>Now I have to try to reorder my life. My job is gone. My apartment is already rented out to someone else. Luckily the landlord at the new place lets me out of my lease. I reschedule the U-Haul to take us to my wife&#x27;s parents&#x27; house instead.<p>My co-founder was devastated. He wasn&#x27;t used to startups. In fact, to this day he&#x27;s been bouncing around trying to find a similarly stable job. I can&#x27;t help but feel responsible. I recovered better. I decided to start consulting for other startups and have made a pretty good go of it.<p>That&#x27;s my accelerator horror story. Anyone else have others?",1377814251

Actually you&#x27;re launching their entire supply factories too (mining, high-purity silicon boule manufacturing, wafer cutting, smelting metals for busbars and backing, etc). None of this has been done in microgravity before. Everything will need mass optimization, and you need provisions for maintenance and repair on all these systems.<p>Doable? Sure.

We don&#x27;t know whether they&#x27;re hard (there&#x27;s no proof; it&#x27;s an &quot;open problem&quot;).<p>Another is that random numbers selected in encryption are uniformly distributed and unpredictable. (In RSA, you pick two large prime numbers, p and q. If two people share a number, say my p is the same as your q, then we&#x27;re both screwed. This particular assumption has been already been violated a bunch of times in the past twenty years; from the Debian OpenSSL thing, to the Android/Bitcoin thing.)<p>There are many other assumptions (Certificate Authorities can be trusted, etc.) that a paranoid person would have to worry about.<p>I think the new hotness is elliptic curve cryptography (e.g. ECDSA), but I don&#x27;t understand it well enough to know if it&#x27;s substantially better than the RSA implementations that are currently popular. I&#x27;d say what we have now is like a lock on the door -- it&#x27;s enough to prevent the neighbour&#x27;s kid from getting in, but not enough to stop a determined lockpick or the government.",1377813805

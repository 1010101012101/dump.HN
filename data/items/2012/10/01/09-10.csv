My major points were: high taxation and employee laws.<p>Your rebuttal on taxation is: ""In addition, these high taxes are the same high taxes that allow entrepreneurs in France to live off of a 70% unemployment salary for 18 months after they are let go from their company. What goes around comes around.""<p>And? That's fine, but that's not what a startup cares about. Sure, it's what a person cares about, but it does nothing to address my fundamental point about the tax/social charge burden.  And your other point about there being an 18 month delay in the first tax return is pointless: the taxes still have to be paid.<p>On employee mobility, you say: ""well, unless of course, you have a periode dessai (trial period) written into the contract (which is the case ~100% of the time), which allows you to let go of an employee with little to no notice for the first three months. Oh, and you can also request to renew the trial period for an additional three months, legally  but you know, if you suddenly hate your employee after six months, well then, buddy, youre S.O.L.""<p>And?

The entire structure of taxation and social charges and the rights of employees means that French entrepreneurs should simply abandon their country if they want to build a startup as might be seen in the US or UK.<p>Between the inability to fire people who aren't working out, to the huge amount of time off people can claim (on top of their vacation) because of all sorts of rights, to the 35 hour employee work week, to the amount of tax and social charges the employer contributes, France is unsuitable for startups. Various governments have talked about different incentives for small companies, but the on the ground situation has not really changed.<p>I have a good friend who runs a small company in France making medical devices. The litany of employee problems that he has to face because he cannot fire people is a nightmare and then there's the taxation. The reality is that he is working to transfer the company's IP away from France and then leave. At that point France starts getting 0 EUR in revenue from him and his firm.<p>Now, in case you think I 'hate France', here's the thing: I think it's a wonderful country to live in, but it is not suited to startups.",1349084593

Just because patents presently allow the pharmaceutical industry to fund R&D costs (estimates of which might be inflated[1]) does not mean they are the only way. If the cost of patents outweigh this one benefit, we should get rid of them.<p>First, not all research is done by the pharmaceutical industry. In the US, they account for about 36% of research spending[2], behind the government (38%, federal plus state plus local). Note that total funding by the industry (not limited to pharma but including biotech and medical devices) represented 58% in 2007 but the role of patents in those industries is a different debate. The remaining 4% are from foundations and charities.<p>Next, considering that pharmaceutical companies spend far more on marketing than research and development (typically 25% vs 15% of revenues respectively)[3] and considering that a large part of their revenues comes from public healthcare anyway, one can wonder how hard it would be to replace their R&D spendings with public funds, and get the money back thanks to cheaper drugs,since generics are typically 20% of the brand price.<p>(BTW I wonder what part of these 15% of revenues spent on R&D is for important research and what part is spent on looking for the next Botox)<p>Also patents could be replaced with public funding in ways that minimize the impact on the industry, for example by granting prizes for the discovery of important drugs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4591766"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4591766</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3118092/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3118092/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050001?imageURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050001.t001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal...</a>",1349083377

Declared cost would be verified and accepted by patent office. Consequently, the upper bound of possible damages awarded during a litigation should be set to that amount of money.<p>Such approach should repel patent trolls twofold. First, since costs of innovation in the software industry tend to revolve around 0, litigations would not be profitable.

4595929,comment,4593902,4593902,19,0,jdietrich,,,"There is no evidence that segregated cycle facilities improve cyclist safety. The majority of serious bicycle accidents are right-of-way disputes, occurring at junctions. It is just as likely that segregated facilities could increase the number of accidents, by making the movements of cyclists less predictable to motorists when they merge onto general roads. It is known that sidewalk cyclists are significantly more vulnerable than cyclists who use the roadway, possibly because their movements are more difficult for motorists to predict.<p>The evidence for the efficacy of cycle helmets is extremely poor. There are a great many people with strong opinions on helmets, but we simply do not have the evidence and it is likely that they are a relatively unimportant factor. While we know that helmets moderately reduce head injuries, we do not have good evidence that they improve rider safety overall. We do have some evidence of risk compensation, with both drivers and riders taking more risks when helmets are used, based on the belief that the helmet provides safety. Head injuries are an important class of injury, particularly in the most severe incidents, but they represent only a minority of the serious injuries suffered by cyclists.<p>The best available evidence shows that one factor completely overwhelms all others - the number of cyclists on the road. Most Americans believe that the numbers of cyclists will increase when action is taken to improve safety, but in fact the inverse is true. An increase in the number of cyclists invariably leads to a decrease in the number of accidents per km. That is the key message and everything else is just noise. Meaningful improvements in cycle safety are wholly reliant on increasing the number of cyclists and normalising cycling. Motorists cannot be blamed for struggling to predict the movements of a type of vehicle which they encounter rarely and do not understand.",1349082416

It's the whole direction Windows is taking. If they and others can get Windows 8 to fail, and get Microsoft to revert back to the old style Windows, then they win.

We stitch together a jumble of technologies (some scripting language or compile language for the backend, javascript, html, css, SQL and whatever else you want to throw into the mix) in order to produce a user experience that tries to hide all that under a friendly front.<p>The limitations of this non-consistent development environment are all too visible in the end results and result in a ton of ways to shoot yourself in the foot performance wise or in ways that result in security problems.<p>The whole concept of 'a framework' needs to be re-visited, it's ugly.

(If 2-out-of-2-teams succeed, maybe they are geniuses, but the 100% success rate cannot disprove the hypothesis that the solution is obvious. If only 2-out-of-30 succeed, maybe there's rewardable inventiveness there.)<p>Still, when there are 2 or more cases of independent invention, that should be economically/legally relevant. This is especially true if one of the inventors <i>didn't</i> pursue a patent. While not be proof of traditional 'obviousness', it is evidence that the invention was ""evident enough to be discovered as needed without patent incentives""... which sounds to me like the economically-ideal standard.<p>(And wouldn't that be a nice counterbalance to the 'patent everything defensively' scramble?

If you're considering dropping out because you can already do what some people are getting a degree for, then you're probably ahead of your peers anyways. So I'm not sure what you'd be missing.<p>But probably the biggest motivation against dropping out is the social acceptance. If any change is to happen then we've got to set in place alternatives for these drop outs so they can do so without negative social stigma.

While I freely admit that my familiarity with Rawlsian justice now comes from about three minutes spent with Wikipedia, it seems an awful lot like his conception of justice foundationally depend on the involvement of ""rational agents"", which includes human-class intelligence as a core part of the definition of that term. It would seem to me that stripping away that aspect of the system leaves virtually nothing left, and certainly nothing that trivially obviously extends out to not-even-possibly-rational agents (or, arguably, <i>non-</i>agents according to the usual meanings of the term) with only 17 words of explanation.<p>(Actually defining justice in a way that covers all life forms is also a rather interesting question to ponder for a while; given the diversity of ""life"", such as the classic ""virus"" conundrum, it becomes hard to avoid including non-life in the definition as well. And what do you do with an ethical system that has an opinion about a black hole destroying a star, whatever that opinion may be?)<p>That said, fully expanding your point would probably blow out the HN comment limit; you could probably get a medium-large essay out of it. But I would be sort of curious if you could sketch out a bit more. I'm actually not interested in attacking it, because I'm not actually trying to push a viewpoint on the question today; the goal of my first paragraph is to more thoroughly explain my confusion about your statement than criticize something too short for me to even understand.",1274766571

First world nations will have the wealth and access to innovations to convert to cleaner energy but the poor majority of the world will increasingly create the demand. Oil is too easy and efficient to just ignore. As I see it the only options to stop this would be to build clean energy sources for the entire world which seems nearly impossible, destroy or prevent access to the remaining oil sources, or occupy and repress these poor countries to actively prevent them from burning oil. The later two options would almost certainly start World War 3. The first option is ideal but not very realistic. We are OK letting these same people die due to lack of basic medical care and clean water. What are the chances we help them convert to clean energy? Without some massive global catastrophe to change the game letting the oil run out is the most peaceful and realistic approach in my opinion.",1274766543

The paper stated ""we did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described"".  It reported interviews with the parents talking about MMR, but did not conclude that itself.  The conclusion was more about the relationship between gastrointestinal issues and autism (also false, but less obviously so).<p>No decent scientist would draw a sweeping conclusion like ""autism is caused by universal vaccination"" from this study.  One study--especially one so small, with no controls and no randomization--does not demonstrate causation no matter how significant the correlation.  The Lancet study (false, but still subtle enough) was misinterpreted due to Wakefield's spin machine and a gullible media.<p>And to be honest, I have no idea why they didn't retract sooner.

You can use emacs as a modal editor but still fall back on all the emacs functionality.<p>For most of the time it works like the best of both worlds, but it's not perfect . You can't use viper-mode in every mode and it's obviously not full vi(m) emulation. Installing the vimpulse.el script (google it) adds a lot of missing vim functionality though.",1274764186

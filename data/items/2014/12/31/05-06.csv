RESTBase has pluggable table storage backends, starting with Cassandra. Other backends will scale this down for small installations.<p>The medium-term goal is to store all revisions as HTML, so that views and HTML-based saves can become storage-bound operations with low double-digit ms latencies. This will mostly eliminate the remaining 2-4% of cache misses, and should get us closer to actual DC fail-over without completely cold caches.<p>There is still a large amount of work to be done until all the puzzle pieces for this are in place, but we are hard at work to make it a reality.

He&#x27;s very clear that he doesn&#x27;t expect this to necessarily happen because people are not 100% rational. He also does have a sense of humour (I know, outrageous right?) which you have to take into account.<p>2) If you read his writings further you&#x27;ll see that he considers a distinction between the financial system and the US dollar arbitrary, because the USG insures all banks he considers the banking/financial system part of the government. The fact that the banks were bailed out by debasing the US dollar is one of the political realities which he would argue makes it more logical to save in gold as opposed to dollars.<p>3) The housing bubble only happened because banks could take on poor loans knowing that the USG would bail them out.",1420005279

Modern cars measure the amount of O2 in the exhaust and adjust the mixture to keep the moles-of-O2 to moles-of-gasoline ratio roughly fixed.<p>The thinner air means you have to open the throttle wider to achieve the same manifold pressure, which in turn means that with the throttle wide-open, the engine will produce less power.  But the thinner air should have no effect on the amount of gas you need to burn to achieve a particular amount of power.",1420004843

It comes straight from <a href=""http://12factor.net/config"" rel=""nofollow"">http://12factor.net/config</a> store configuration data in the environment.<p>What I do for most projects is keep the tree containing the working directory in a directory that has some other items that don&#x27;t belong on github (like the project brief, my emacs bookmarks file, random notes related to the project etc. ) and in that directory there is a .credentials file containing a set of export statements somewhat like:<p><pre><code>   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n    export AWS_SECRET_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n    export AWS_USER_ID=############\n</code></pre>\nIf I&#x27;m feeling extra paranoid, I&#x27;ll encrypt that into a blob that I only decrypt when I&#x27;m working on said project.<p>Then at startup the app goes looking for it&#x27;s config in the environment. This does create issues for some environments ( solving this for docker is trivial ) but you can usually pass environment variables to whatever is executing your code reasonably securely. Now it&#x27;s not perfect, and environments can sometimes be revealed externally if an attacker is determined and clever and focused on your app for some reason.<p>But it does give you a hygienic procedure that keeps your credentials that are equivalent to an open draw on your bank account out of public repositories.",1420004623

The beginning is a rehash of Philosophy 101, but after a while he gets into neural models of visual processing in the brain which can be implemented in software. That part is quite good. That alone would have been a good talk.<p>Around 13 minutes in, after mentioning and dismissing linguistic representations, he starts talking about simulation-type representations of the external world.  This is progress.  Historically, there&#x27;s been an obsession with linguistic (or worse, predicate-calculus) models.  Simulation-type representations, ones which can answer &quot;what happens next&quot; or &quot;what if&quot; questions, But he doesn&#x27;t develop that concept further.<p>Then, around 20 minutes in, he gets off on dreams and meditation, and &quot;how is it possible to be conscious without a self&quot;, and &quot;free will is a social notion&quot;, none of which is helpful. By minute 26, he&#x27;s off on psychedelic experiences and love.  Around minute 30, he&#x27;s off on dualism, questions like &quot;is the mind part of the universe&quot;, and &quot;could we build a mind in Minecraft&quot;. Then there&#x27;s solipsism, and &quot;are we living in a simulation&quot;, and whether it matters.<p>&quot;Preference criteria for suitable encoding&quot;, at minute 34, starts to explore computational metaphysics, the nature of reality, and other deep subjects. Shallowly.<p>There&#x27;s some good stuff in here, but it&#x27;s not sorted out between what&#x27;s actually known, what&#x27;s conjectured, and what&#x27;s speculated.  If you stop watching at minute 20, you&#x27;ll have seen all the good stuff.  The philosophical excess baggage can be skipped.<p>I would have liked to see more on simulation-type representations of the real world. That&#x27;s where &quot;common sense&quot; is probably implemented. (A useful definition of common sense, from a robotics or animal perspective, is that it is about getting through the next ten seconds or so of life without screwing up big-time. As a practical matter, we really need to get a good handle on that to build useful robots for unstructured environments. Google is trying to do this for automatic driving, apparently as a big-data problem.)",1420002792

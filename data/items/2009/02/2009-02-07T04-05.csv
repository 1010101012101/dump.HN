I'm the opposite.<p>I will admit right now that I copy/borrow/steal design and concept ideas from other websites relentlessly.<p>I find, however, that I tend to do it for stuff around the periphery of an application. For example, how should my forgot password process work? What should my copyright notice look like? How should I format a success or error notification message? What should my button widgets look like?<p>Such things that are not central to the purpose of an application I am working I expend as little thought as possible on, and tend to copy whatever I see someone successful doing (hey, i think, if it didn't stand in their way, it probably won't stand in mine). I spend more of my ""picking apart"" brainpower on the original/unique stuff my app is doing.<p>Admittedly, I do a fair amount of copying of the kind you are referring to as well, but I don't entirely agree that that's the ""only"" kind of copying that's beneficial.",1233982751

Suppose we can simulate interactions between atoms nearly perfectly on a computer... then it's just a matter of making an atom-for-atom digital replication of the brain (understanding of course that this is all easier said than done, but all possible). Once that is achieved, we optimize and make it even better by thinking faster and more accurately than we ever could. What are you missing from this?

If she's arguing that internalizing blame for not being constantly brilliant or being able to maximize your brilliance puts undue stress on amazing people, then maybe learning to live with that fact rather externalizing the blame to something imaginary would be a better idea. That way, you will at least be comfortable enough with your own mind to maybe begin exploring real ways to improve your genius productivity (see also: <a href=""http://nomediakings.org/time_management_for_anarchists/free_anarchomic_released.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nomediakings.org/time_management_for_anarchists/free_...</a>).",1233981824

470791,comment,470254,470781,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Those were quoted a part of the initial public response to Arc, it didn't really go into why they were bad things - and the impact they had. The fact that they were part of blog chatter when Arc was released only is, to be blunt, really at best only marginally interesting. e.g. Have these things changed? Are they still relevant?<p>Being built on top the JVM gives you access to libraries - is this the meat? If so, I think most people already knew that. I think the ""Ipso Facto therefore Clojure will be the 100 year language, not Arc"" is a bit of a leap given all that.<p>I don't think the Author needs to justify anything - I don't need to agree with him - I'm just saying I got no real content out of this article.<p>You're right, probably taking it too seriously, but I'm of the view that even something lighthearted has to have some content (in fact, that's where humour is at it's peak).",1233980745

Well, as somebody with experience developing niche sites, let me explain. Typically a ""niche"" site is appealing to a slim set of users. It's called the ""long tail."" The idea is that by appealing to a single like, you can get a more concentrated bunch of uses. You with me so far?<p>By that logic, this site appeals to bacon likers. It's a diverse group. Hell, I'm sure <i>you</i> know some bacon likers yourself! This site is perfect for them, because it effectively ties into other programs without restraining functionality to any difficult degree. I tried it out on lucrative sites such as Facebook, Google, and Hacker News, and I'll report I was impressed!<p>Now, the fascinating thing is that with their bookmarklet, you can easily add this functionality to any web page you want! Think of it like Web 2.0: sites aren't static any more. People can add their own functionality and modify pages. This one does it simply and effectively. I haven't even noticed a lag!<p>Hopefully you find this site as fascinating as I did. I regret the lack of simplicity and focus in web sites nowadays, and I think that by following the lessons set in place like a simple site like this, a lot of developers could do some genuine good.<p><pre><code>    </div></code></pre>",1233980365
470786,comment,470254,470573,0,0,ricree,,,"True enough, but I do think there might be a lot of validity in the comparison with hurd.  After all, Hurd is still under development, but there is little question that it has been eclipsed by Linux.  While many have certainly become aware of the advantages of Lisp, they also want something that just works as much as possible, and the large collection of Java libraries will be a great help in this regard.  By the time that arc is ""ready"" to be the 100 year language, it may be that it is too late to gain acceptance.<p>Still, I'll admit that only time will tell.  Both languages are still quite young, and it is hardly uncommon for languages to develop slowly in obscurity before rising to prominence.  Maybe it will gain traction, maybe it won't, but either way I think we will benefit from the increase in competition and the ideas that are generated in its creation.",1233980208

If a selector has enough rulesets to justify a wrap I usually let the first line be positioning rules, second box-model rules and third color rules and so on.

However, it would be interesting to know how long a candidate took to develop a solution from the initial proposition of the challenge and the code submission.<p>2) I'm not sure if this would be an issue, but isn't it possible for someone to game the system by using multiple emails?  Perhaps a challenge and response would have more merit if the resume submission was the first step of the workflow.  Candidates aren't likely to enter drastically different resumes in order to submit multiple solutions, and they could probably be detected (manually) if they tried to anyway.<p>3) I'm guessing you just launched this thing recently, but a more complete demo of the workflow (without actually signing up!) would be cool on your home/support page.<p>This is a great idea.  We do code challenges/reviews at work for hiring.  I am really intrigued with this approach of an upfront technical challenge.  It could save us a lot of time down the road.",1339286213

Anyone can build a vehicle that meets a standard inspection, and once passed that vehicle can be used as a cab.  No limit on the number of drivers, no limit on the number of taxis, both inspected but not limited.  The result is that different drivers work different convenient hours, some full time and some part time, with larger numbers of cabs available at rush hours and other times of heavy demand.  All the drivers know how to drive well, all the taxis are clean and in perfect shape, and there's always one available when you need it. This is what makes it truly possible to live better in central London without a car than with one.<p>All the schemes to forbid more competitors simply hand profits to taxi operators and produce poor service for taxi users.

It's definitely given me something to think about.</i><p>Yes, that is huge.  Debt-backed currency means someone is profiting off the mere existence of the currency, typically the banking system and government and anyone who owns the government bonds backing the currency, but at the expense of everyone else who uses and 'saves' it (that's not really saving).<p>The given rationalization for that is that a depreciating currency strongly incentivizes people to spend it or invest it instead of hoarding it in their savings accounts, improving economic growth.  That's also the argument against a deflationary currency like gold-backed or bitcoin - that the ultimate result is decreased economic activity and growth.<p>However, that's an argument that grew out of an earlier time, when the world was less connected and dynamic.  I suspect that a deflationary currency is much less of problem in our modern world, where economic activity happens at the speed of light and electricity and almost the entire world is integrated into a common market and economy.<p>In that world there is already huge incentive to spend an invest, and while a deflationary currency would represent a significant change, I don't think economic activity would ground to a halt under a deflationary currenncy.<p>In fact, the problem we're now seeing in the US and Europe is the opposite - too much incentive for borrowing and spending, not enough incentive for capital formation, eg savings.  Too much debt at every level of society, from individuals to sovereign governments.  I can't help but wonder if a deflationary currency that appreciates in value over time instead of depreciates would provide a higher bar for spending and investment, and alter that dynamic in favor of savings (which also a form of investment, as banks use savings to make loans).<p>Instead of US government bonds being the risk-free rate of return, a deflationary currency would be.  That alone would be a huge economic shift, and might limit governments' out-of-control spending simply by giving investors a stronger alternative to government bonds.  If a deflationary currency appreciates by, say ~3% per year, then government bonds would have to match beat that to attract investors, forcing governments to borrow and spend with more discretion.<p>Anyway, yes it definitely is something to think about.  It's also probably a pure thought experiment, I don't see governments giving up the risk free rate of return status for their bonds any time soon.",1339283774

If invoking a hash twice is prohibitive and you are looking at choosing amongst SHA-3 finalists as an alternative (particularly given that many of them are slower than SHA-2, and I believe they are all slower than SHA-1 on low cost CPU's where you might expect this constraint), you are already talking about a very narrow performance window (literally one iteration of Moore's Law covers the gap). You then throw in that people are making refined selection of hash algorithms taking in to account various security nuances, and I think you are dealing not only with a narrow context, but a degree of cryptographic expertise that you don't have to worry that anyone solving it would be consulting this blog or Hacker News in general. ;-)",1339283772

I.e. only allow a person who had bought the thing directly from the government to use it for driving a cab. Then the drivers could take out loans from someone to purchase a medallion, but that loan would be on the same terms as anyone else.",1339283130

You just know that any time you have any address you want on hand.\n2) With Mailinator you just use any name when you register on some website. (generated names are suspicious)\n3) Mailinator has different domains to avoid blacklisting (domain name doesn't matter. You just need to know the username to check your mail)\n4) There are websites that try to you using Mailinator by trying to log is with the name of your e-mail. For these services you can use another generated name that can only be used for sending mail, not for logging in.\n5) Mailinator does not retain your messages for long. Also everything is stored in memory (as far as I heard), so the messages cannot be stolen.",1339283031

I was clear that they work <i>despite</i> features of a hash algorithm that would appear to address the issues highlighted in the article. I was also very clear that it is the defender's problems that are deceptively hard.<p>In a couple of cases I probably should have said ""simple"" instead of ""easy"". ""Easy"" implies more about effort than complexity. At some points I meant ""little effort"" and other points I meant ""little complexity"", but I used the same word for both, so that's bad.<p>Still, I don't get how you inferred the above from this, which to me reads as ""any efforts you might make to address this problem your own way will almost certainly fail miserably"":<p><i>It's just not nearly as easy as this article suggests, and conclusions one might draw from this article (like you can solve this problem by feeding all source text in to the hash algorithm backwards) are likely ill founded.</i>",1339282976

Of course you do devaluate the entire currency when you create additional BTC, but the same is true when M2 is increased in fractional-reserve banking.<p>Did I get the argument right?<p>I'm sure many people disagree with A (which I have only paraphrased <i>very</i> broadly since it seems hopeless to represent it in a few sentences here). B seems to be a widespread characterization of fractional reserve banking, and fairly accurate to me (but all of this bewilders me) -- is it controversial? C seems interesting; although of course this raises the question whether there aren't other alternatives that could replace/complement our monetary system (and he does discuss some in an article he links to).",1339282948

Brides are a very unique set of users and quite a bit different from the average user set of any given site.  They will picture themselves in your pictures if possible, and pretty pictures absolutely do sell to them, so keep that in mind with the photos you choose.  However, as parent has noted, your front page should show something of what the product does.<p>My opinion here stems from substantial interaction with brides, especially pre-wedding.

We serve it up right next to your email, so you don't have to hunt around for it.  We want to help you engage more meaningfully with the people you email.<p>We've found different people find it useful for different reasons.  Founders, journalists and BD people get a lot of mail from people they don't know, and we've had a lot of love from that demographic because we help them put a face to the email.  But as you say, a lot of people get mail mostly from people they already know.<p>We've got some ideas coming up for that which we think are going to be incredibly useful.  Right now, if you get an email from a friend, you can see their recent tweets right there in your email - I've found this really useful, as I can refer to their tweets while replying to their email, or see who else they've been talking to.  There's a lot more coming along those lines.<p>Is there anything we could do that would make it indispensable to you?",1280786267

So basically the citizens have nothing to do but live a completely hedonistic life.<p>Whenever they encounter ""primitive"" societies, they try to make them more human and civilized. Basically the opposite of the ""prime directive"". The organization responsible for that is called Contact. Unfortunately, in order to make these societies more humane they sometimes have to resort to some dirty tricks (like assassinating evil dictators, instigating civil wars, etc etc). The organization responsible for that is called ""Special Circumstances"".<p>Another author I find great is Sheri Tepper.

It really wasn't all that complex (I just implemented Smith-Waterman directly, as a demonstration), only intended to perform fuzzy matches at Gbps speeds to winnow the working dataset down to a size more palatable to a desktop workstation.<p>My understanding is that all these projects (mine included) were cast adrift when the funding for them evaporated in the post-9/11 climate.

1569167,comment,1568282,1568282,0,0,stevis,,,"THE ROLE OF FIRST NATION<p>Mancur Olson suggested offering generic benefits to attract people to his large groups.<p>The difficulty in that is where do these benefits come from? Small groups don't have the resources to put that together. So we came up with First Nation - something large and stable enough to put together core packages of benefits for any other Nation to offer to their members.<p>Then there's the problem of what groups should be able to get them? A group of 10 people? 1000? 10,000? First nation would have to set some kind of criteria.<p>It's a non-profit. There are a dozen ways you can set it up to avoid it becoming a king-maker.<p>We realized we could also use First Nation as a Watchdog group. They're not necessary for this part of the system to work, but it could be effective.<p>Congress voted on a financial overhaul bill last week, for example. First Nation would have polled the other Nations to see how they felt about what needs to be done, what they'd like to see.<p>The financial industry had lots of lobbyists involved in the bill, but there were few, if any, representatives from consumer protection groups or similar. In this scenario, I'm pretty sure at least one or two Nations would propose some new ideas or have some comment on what was passed.<p>They'd try to convince other Nations to lend support. This ""encompassing coalition"" of Nations could sway the direction of financial overhaul to something that's beneficial to the larger public rather than the bank lobby.<p>SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS<p>These aren't special interest groups.<p>I'd join a Science Nation, for example. What's their agenda in financial regulation? None. But I bet some of the people there might have some interesting and good perspective on what should be done. These are ""general interest groups"". If the bill being discussed were about funding a supercollider, on the other hand, then I think you could say they're biased. And the other Nations would know it.<p>GRIDLOCK<p>That's a terrible argument. If your car can only go 10 mph, then it might help you avoid fatal crashes, but it also makes it difficult to go anywhere. Take Immigration Reform. The system has been broken for 20 years. Did you see the bit in the comic about why negative campaigning works in a winner-take-all system? Immigration hasn't been fixed because right now all a politician needs to do is discredit an idea instead of proposing a new one. There is no ""win"" for anyone who proposes an idea.<p>WHAT'S THE 67,000 FOR?<p>Fair question. I'm running for office and using the campaign to pitch an idea that might help fix the system a little bit. Even if you don't buy Olson's ideas, the <i>worst</i> that happens is that you end up with groups that offer benefits similar to AARPs. I do need to fund my campaign. I didn't think asking for a dollar was so onerous that it would raise suspicion of impropriety.<p>TEA PARTY<p>Well, they really <i>are</i> bogeymen. :-)",1280784796

Not to mention people's resistance to change, especially with something as important as their money. And that is only on the <i>retail</i> banking side. It's even worse in i-banking, with the bigger investment banks making more money than ever on Wall Street, as if the crash of 2008 never happened. They may be crooks, but they have the money and influence to make sure the laws get written in their favour - see <a href=""https://www.banksimple.net/blog/2010/07/21/banks-strike-back/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.banksimple.net/blog/2010/07/21/banks-strike-back...</a> (there was an article on HN recently around this post.)<p>Also looked into providing the ""valuable services"" you mention too, a la Mint.com (no equivalent where I live) and this is something I believe there is certain potential (you will have to build a service that taps into banks online portals and offers more useful features than the banks themselves, e.g. account aggregation, financial product comparisons, tailored financial advice etc.) I think the future is one where virtually ordinary transactions will be done online (paying bills, transferring funds), possibly on smartphones, and where you only go into a branch to get a mortgage or something major - and possibly not even then. Of course you can do all this already online, but the world is still very cash and cheque based outside of the US. It will be a while yet until the majority of people are willing to do 100% of their banking with an institution that is 100% web-based.",1280783787

Basically once you stop paying, you can still access the app but cannot make any changes to your event planning.<p>Regarding the timezone setting, since user can set up reminders in Marrily to get notified (via email and through their phone), it's critical to know their timezone so that the application can send out the notifications at the right time.  The timezone dropdown on the sign up actually tries to be smart and pick out the timezone based on the user's current time.<p>You're right, Marrily at this stage is not yet ready for international usage yet.  All the time-related fields are parsed as %m/%d/%Y (m/dd/yyyy).  Once the main app is finalized, I'll add more international support and customization (like time dislay format, and how to format the contact name:  ""First Last"", or ""Last, First"").<p>Regarding your comment about the Expenses, this is probably the weakest part of the app.  I built a prototype that lets user enter in their budget for each categories and track their expenses accordingly,  but I ripped that off since I didn't think it was god enough to release yet.  I'd need to do further research and ask people for feedback before building this feature again.

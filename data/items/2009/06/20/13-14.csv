The best way to read them is a little at a time, taking the parts that click in your mind and trying them out on problems that seemed insurmountable before. The first time you open a big box of strange tools, it won't be immediately apparent to you what they are all for.<p>Finding a good math book is like stumbling into that room full of all of the weapons on your first time through Doom...",1245506326
666415,comment,665579,666389,0,0,wglb,,,"Well the match.com business model is a bit difficult.  If their service is successful, two people meet and eventually take their profile down and leave match behind.  There is no retention, because a successful experience removes two people from their customer list. In fact, there is a stage of dating that follows First Date: ""I took my profile down"".<p>So attracting customers rather than the long-term experience would be their priority.  I met my wife on match, and many mutual friends met their now spouse there.",1245506269

A good friend of mine described the articles displayed here as a ""rat's nest"" which does not lead anywhere.  At first, I thought he was crazy; then I began critically looking at said articles.<p>I signed up here looking for what the original post posits providing; what I found were articles about startups, business, marketing, the current/next great gold rush, followed by the token (recently it has been improving) programmer/hacker article.  And the articles about startups, business, and marketing were not great on any scale; in fact upon critical review, said articles advocated rather bad strategies.  Strategies which amounted to little more than legalized scams, strategies which optimize for the short term, strategies promoting win at any cost, strategies which advocate me first and to hell with the consequences; in short, strategies of which Phineas Taylor Barnum would have been proud.<p>Before joining the Hacker News community, I was interested in starting my own business.  Now that I see what is advocated as ""startup culture"", I want nothing to do with starting a business in the United States (because my conclusion is the culture and laws of the U.S. have optimized for short term gain, with the resulting push towards the strategies mentioned earlier).  What happened to a business (either startup or established business) having integrity in all of their relationships, being a responsible citizen of the business ecosystem it operates within, and providing a legacy beyond the generation within which it was founded?<p>In conclusion, I would be VERY interested in being involved with the community type proposed by jcapote (in any capacity: contributing member, developer, beta tester, et cetera).",1245505818

How?",,"Do you buy and read math books? do you read them cover to cover or do you just use them as a reference book?<p>I typically buy a lot of math and physics, hard cs books, etc., but they take a lot of time to read so I end up collecting them, while reading them slowly (because hard science books could take months to read, at least if you don't have a lot of time for that!). Is that a typical hacker thing or is it just me?<p>I'm asking because I keep buying books about stuff I want to learn, but I also look at my library and I ask myself: ""why don't I read these first?"" Who knows, maybe today I want to learn something different than yesterday.",1245505394
666406,comment,665284,666103,0,0,Retric,,,"What separates the insane from the sane is the ability to function in society.  Few people have zero problems so as we require ever higher levels of competence the idea of insanity has been diluted.  Now days becoming medicated has lost some of it's stigma, because it helps people function in society.  I fear the ever reducing range of accepted ""normal human behavior"" over time.<p>Yet, many people who have real problems can be helped.  So, removing the stigma is a good thing when it helps people with real problems seek help.",1245505328

666394,comment,666387,666387,0,0,dlnovell,,,"I find meditation to be the best cure when I'm particularly anxious about something. At first I just spend a few minutes trying to completely empty my mind. This can take significant practice if it doesn't come naturally. Then I start into a visualization of the powers of 10 video (yeah, I know it's cheesy but it works!). During that visualization I try to focus on my minute position in the universe, and by the end I'm usually incredibly calm. Whole thing can take less than 10 minutes and I can go from being a wreck to calm.<p>That's just my routine. Everyone who meditates has their own. It's just kinda whatever works for you. I highly recommend checking out the hundreds or thousands of sites on the interwebs that teach basic/beginner meditation. It's well worth a shot.<p>Best of luck buddy... getting a grip on your anxiety probably won't be easy, but is absolutely necessary for good mental and physical health.",1245503972

666389,comment,665579,665579,0,0,Goladus,,,"Unless you are a paid member, you cannot even read messages sent to you.  Also, their homepage is always a gigantic advertisement, with a tiny little bit of text, ""member sign in,"" up near the top.  Old correspondence is deleted after something like 30 or 60 days.  Pictures are limited in size.<p>Match.com is pretty lazy about retaining members and encouraging interaction and seems to prefer to focus on marketing rather than improving its core product.  Okcupid is superior in almost every way.  Match.com has made a few attempts at upgrading their services but they seem to have been mostly cosmetic or invisible/infrastructure changes.  When I left, ""recent views"" was still questionably accurate, the send-email page still had no link back to the original profile (just a partial text dump of it), and generally poor use of screen space.  Not as bad as eHarmony, but okcupid is better and free.<p>I met a few cool women through match.com, but finally got fed up with it.  I don't care enough to sue but I have no sympathy for match.",1245503047

I also went to a doctor and he assured me that I didn't have any physical problems.

Soon there were three versions of the document, so there were threads going back and forth around ""which is the latest document"".<p>As for EchoSign, they authenticate that the person who signed the document must have at one point clicked through a link which went to their e-mail address. This is much better than the authentication of written signatures, i.e. that someone could scribble something on a piece of paper in the same way that you did it.",1245502817

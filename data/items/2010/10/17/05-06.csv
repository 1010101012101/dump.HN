If someone is capable and driven enough to attract these sort of awards, I wouldn't expect their (dis)taste for formal education to have much effect on their odds of success.<p>I think the real point here is that they are making bets on the young and idealistic kids that haven't been tarnished by years of drudgery, beauracracy, and being told that they can't do things. So they do whatever wild ideas interest them, and if any one of those kids happened to be right about something that more 'educated' people would consider idiotic, it's a massive win. Kind of like the old DARPA approach or Google's 20% time. In that respect going after dropouts would make a lot of sense, since those are going to be the types that care less about following the establishment and will be more likely to execute genuinely novel ideas.",1287295182

This <i>is</i> a real issue for new Lua users, though in the long run it's not a showstopper.<p>For roughly half the people using Lua, library choices have already been decided by the big C++ (or whatever) project they're adding Lua to, so the question never arises in the first place. That's the primary use case for Lua. It's a really nice standalone language, too, but it was designed for embedding. Many of its strengths (such as the small, orthogonal, clean design) come from that focus, but so do some quirks. If you use Lua as a standalone language, you'll occasionally need to do some digging for libraries, particularly if you're not comfortable with C. The situation has been improving significantly over the last year or two, though.<p>I don't have a specific Unicode library recommendation, but would suggest checking the mailing list archives (<a href=""http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/</a>).",1287294573

Certain recipes have multiple concurrent groups of steps, so the solution would either have to be perfect or free-form would be better.<p>- When creating a recipe in landscape mode, the keyboard hides a couple of the fields in the modal panel.

Just look at how many people have bunions - they're almost <i>exclusively</i> caused by shoes, plus some genetic causes which typically start <i>much</i> later in life.<p>There's also a <i>very</i> big difference in toe strength from having them be able to move separately, and I've had a noticeable improvement in balance from wearing them.  And I'm pretty stable anyway.  When your toes are stuck moving together, they don't develop any ability to do so, and toes are pretty important to walking / balancing.<p>(edited for toes instead of bunions, as I think it makes a better case)",1287291885
1799717,comment,1799422,1799676,0,0,fnl,,,"Well, that is a good answer, too. I did not read it that way but then seeing it that way (based on pollution) actually is quite agreeable - although not proven. (We simply do not conclusively know the impact of cancer rate increase because of pollution except in special cases where the pollution is above ""normal"" - at least I am not aware of any such publication.) Also, what cancer-related organizations quote as bad - ""There is nothing in the natural environment that can cause cancer. So it has to be a man-made disease, down to pollution and changes to our diet and lifestyle"" is exactly that - a very misleading phrasing. So, yes, you can interpret this article two ways: either ""pro"" Schütz or ""pro"" David/Zimmerman. I understood the article as advocating the latter, however, to my relief most people seemed to anyways see it as it should be understood. So, maybe my question was not clear in the first place - or, more like it, I think, you guys have quite elegantly resolved my concerns :)",1287291870

I can't speak for whether that actually represents any measurable benefit to it, gait-wise.<p>I suspect that it'd make you more stable just because your toes can settle on slightly different levels on uneven ground, but that's just guessing.<p>Mainly I like that it's letting my toes spread out as much as they feel like. My toes are less lumped together now after a day in shoes. (And my old shoes weren't overly narrow or anything like that.)",1287291809

Though I don't know about hiding the free packages, if your not going to promote it why have it and surely a free customer is better than none. I Think this calls for some A/B testing.",1287291677

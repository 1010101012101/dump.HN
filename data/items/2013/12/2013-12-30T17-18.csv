So do my couple mile snowshoe hikes count if I carefully never break a sweat?

BitCoin is treated by 99% of it&#x27;s users as an ASSET not as a CURRENCY. No one is buying services in Bitcoin, if does not want to hide.

But the reason that it often gets glossed over is that it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference when it comes to the complexity class of the problem. In this case, the decision version of the problem is: Does a path exist shorter than K? But once you have a solution to that, you can use binary search to answer the optimization version of the problem: Find k such that there exists a path = k and no path < k.<p>But when it comes to the question of verifiers the distinction does matter. because NP is only concerned with decision problems the OP is incorrect when he says that there&#x27;s no poly time verifier, because there is one for the decision version of the problem, and that&#x27;s all that matters.",1388425971

Or even visual or audio prothesis, made possible with advancements in brain-computer interfaces?<p>Your argument basically boils down to saying that the rate of CPU clock speeds developed in recent history is indicative of an overall slowdown in computer science. Clearly there are other paradigms that need to be explored before we can say that Moore&#x27;s law is no longer relevant, let alone all of computing.<p>Yes, the average of all medical tech is going to always lag behind computing for ethical reasons.

6985745,comment,6984821,6984821,5,0,tony_mono,,,"I have about a year of industry knowledge working with ATMs.  NCR and Diebold hold a huge portion of the North American ATM market and likely European too. All of the NCR and Diebold machines I worked on were running locked down Windows XP as of a couple of years ago.  The PC hardware is fairly standard. Most of the peripherals like cash dispensers connect via USB to the PC in the ATM.<p>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to look at the exploit but I&#x27;d assume it didn&#x27;t necessarily use auto-play.  The OS images that are loaded on these machines are highly customized and would likely prevent auto-loading a usb driver.  However, either it auto-loaded or they exploited some other USB bug in Windows.<p>Once they could load code then they would have been able to manipulate the cash dispenser using an XFS app[0]. This would let them dispense bills from the safe to the customer facing throat.  However, once the machine was restocked the bill counts would be off and the banks backend should detect the tampering.<p>Based on the story it sounds like they were able to load code into the banking application to allow activating their hack from the pin pad.  To me that seems to indicate either a former engineer of NCR/Diebold or someone who got their hands on a used ATM and spent a lot of time reverse engineering the application software and chassis.<p>I&#x27;ve also made the assumption that this was done on a free-standing ATM[1].  Wall mount ATMs that you see at most banks are mostly behind the wall and would be extremely difficult to get access to a USB port.<p>[0] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEN/XF"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEN/XFS</a>  \n[1] <a href""http://www.diebold.com/products-services/atm-self-service/terminals/full-function-cash-dispenser/Pages/522-lobby.asp"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.diebold.com/products-services/atm-self-service/te...</a>",1388425779

Today, age 27, I weigh 205 - 208. I have learned a lot about weight and health management.<p>I am not a fan of the &quot;fad&quot; diets or diets that have &quot;claims.&quot; Throughout the years, I have found that balance in life facilitates happiness/mindfulness.<p>I have found that my body feels best, when it has good rest, good food, and has been active. Those are subjective to each person and their current state of health.<p>I have a few tips for anyone looking to live a bit healthier. These are from my experiences.<p>Exercise is important. But, the opposite is just as important, rest. I used to run at least 5 miles every morning, and sometimes run again in evening. I found that I was increasingly tired, and anxious. Rest days are important, and so is sleep in general. Listen to your body.<p>Throughout the years, I have found that my body responds best to a mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercise. I used to lean 75% aerobic and 25% anaerobic, but today its more like 35% aerobic and 65% anaerobic.<p>Learn proper techniques in everything. Food intake and exercise have direct impact on your well being, there is no reason to injure oneself.<p>Do not compare your physical fitness to others.<p>Set goals. I find that achieving success, whatever you deem that to be, is just a series of steps done in a linear progression.<p>I like to keep calendar/alarms to remind me to eat properly and exercise. For example, right now, during the holidays. I made sure to have cardio built into my week, otherwise it gets pushed aside.<p>Feel free to give feedback or advice.",1388425267

The simplest way to see this is that if you have solved a TSP you have also automatically solved the Hamiltonian Path problem for the corresponding graph and the Hamiltonian Path problem is known to be NP complete.<p>What the op does not state and which is also very important to realize however is that TSP is also NP easy (and hence NP equivalent). In other words if you have an algorithm that can solve any NP complete problem in polynomial time (ie. P == NP) then you can use that algorithm to solve TSP (actually any finite optimization problem) in polynomial time.

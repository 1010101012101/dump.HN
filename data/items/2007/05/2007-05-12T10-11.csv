21570,comment,21377,21527,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Your examples are foreigners in a time of war.  The interview asks them why they were detained without any other information from other sources on their case.  I think most people you ask in prison will say they are innocent.  In any case, this is not an example of a US citizen being put in jail etc for political reasons.  <p>Also, the main point here is that even if the US were prosecuting people for their politics, which they are not, it would not make what Google is doing any better.  What Google is doing is directly aiding in the political prosecution of people in China, and nothing makes this right.<p>I think I've said now more than enough, and so I withdraw from this thread.",1178965828

MySpace also uses ""MSFT technology"".<p>I'm personally not one to hate.  If you can get your rocks off on MS tech, then so be it.  FeedBurner rocks some incredible stuff out in Java, in amazing time.<p>I personally wouldn't start something in anything but RoR or Python these days.",1178964505

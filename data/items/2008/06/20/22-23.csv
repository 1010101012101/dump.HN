It's not even close.<p>Large corporations are big and slow.  They make poor decisions a lot.  But they got big by doing at least one thing right.  Sometimes it's just an efficiency of scale, but it's an efficency nonetheless.  In software specifically, it is <i>sometimes</i> possible for a startup to outcompete an established competitor, but certainly not always.<p>And outside of software it's almost unheard of: try to displace Exxon/Mobil by being ""smart"" and ""agile"", for example.",1214001490

When Kelvin said that, there wasn't even a hint of an engine that could actually power an airplane.  He was basically right: in the middle of the 19th century, the Wright brothers would have failed to produce an airplane.<p>Likewise the Western Union quote about the telephone.  The devices demonstrated in 1878 really were primitive, and competed very poorly with telegrams for rapid communication.<p>But yeah, it's all funny.",1214001207

223282,comment,223195,223267,0,0,run4yourlives,,,">""Measuring inflation requires finding objective ways of separating out changes in nominal prices from other influences related to real activity. In the simplest possible case, if the price of a 10 oz. can of corn changes from $0.90 to $1.00 over the course of a year, with no change in quality, then this price change represents inflation. But we are usually more interested in knowing how the overall cost of living changes, and therefore instead of looking at the change in price of one good, we want to know how the price of a large 'basket' of goods and services changes.""<p>Basically, I'm trying to point out that inflation is a hotly contested complex term, which we are currently demonstrating by linking to different sections of the same entry that somewhat contradict.<p>It is far to large a topic to be understood in a one page primer that states: ""Government prints too much money.""",1214000889

223276,comment,223005,223266,0,0,palish,,,"Yes, you're correct.  That would both eliminate the error for initial replies and dramatically reduce the rate that continuations expire when using other site features.  Unfortunately, that would completely remove the ability to ""reply"".  :)<p>When a logged-in user loads a Hacker News page, the server <i>must</i> generate a unique set of continuations for that user (one per each link that requires a continuation.)  In other words, if everyone shared the same set of continuations, everyone would see the exact same Hacker News.  The username in the upper-right corner would be the same, everyone's comments would be tagged with the same username, etc.  Does that make sense?<p>So the ""reply"" link requires a continuation because you're adding a comment that's tagged with your username.  But the ""link"" link does not require one because you're simply viewing a comment.",1214000409

I was as annoyed as the original poster when this paper (HPL-2007-193) was on HN and I tried to save it so that I could read it later.  I ended up doing Print->Save As PDF from scribd.  When someone later posted a link to the original PDF, it was much nicer looking, smaller in size (4MB versus 164KB), and had the original metadata (e.g. authors, description).",1214000111
223272,comment,223261,223261,0,0,markbao,,,"I'm still sticking with Safari. Firefox's faster, but there's nothing that beats the speed of Safari on Mac, and in addition it is Cocoa (while Firefox is Carbon.) For some reason, this makes Safari <i>feel</i> like a more solid browser, and Firefox feeling like a typical Carbon app (whatever that is - just a weird user experience using it.)<p>If the dealbreaker is extensions, then I have to say that the only extensions I use in Firefox are Web Developer Toolbar and Firebug, which are excellent extensions. I only start Firefox to a) test sites on Firefox and b) use the aforementioned extensions.<p>Safari has a good built-in alternative to Firebug, which is available by going to Safari > Preferences > Advanced and checking <i>Show Develop menu in menu bar</i>. Then go to Develop > Web Inspector (or the other tools there.) Good for quick Javascript troubleshooting, as it also has a Javascript error/eval console.<p>In Firefox, I've found that other extensions usually make the browser more bloated and slower to use. They're nice, and sure, you could have ForecastFox tell you the weather, but it's not worth the bloat, in my opinion. And themes... :|<p>If you're like me, you'll miss a lot of extensions, but realize in the end that you don't <i>really</i> need most of them. del.icio.us was a favorite extension of mine. On Safari, I put the del.icio.us bookmarklet as the first bookmark on my menu bar. Then I hide the menu bar (apple+shift+b.) When I want to bookmark something to del.icio.us, I hit <i>Apple+1</i>, tag, save.<p>Firefox is a great browser, and Firefox 3 makes it even better, but Safari is a fast, no-frills, and great web browser. Although Safari has less 3rd party addons (and most of them superb, like Inquisitor) it's a web browser that does what you should expect it to do, and fast - browse the web.",1214000033
223271,comment,222866,223206,0,0,deathbob,,,"As near as I can tell the authors point is ""all [scribd] does is strip me of basic functionality...So some engineers could do some flash-based masturbation & feel web 2.0"".  It's just an ignorant rant.  Plenty of other people pointed out that scribd has the features he claims it lacks, I didn't feel the need to echo that.  What I did feel was important is that the author of the article missed the point of why scribd exists entirely.  It does not exist to strip functionality or demo flash skills, or to ""lock things up by placing it in their own jackass format"".  Scribd is a service that allows people to share documents.  I thought pointing out the parallels between the service youtube offers and what scribd does, and the compromises inherent in implementing such a service would be illuminating, but apparently it's not helping you.  I also said that since scribd basically translates all the various formats uploaded to one standard display format, it makes sense that they have total control over the end format.  I thought that shed some light on why they chose to use ipaper instead of pdf or any other format, but apparently you don't agree.  Whatever.  \np.s.  Let me know when i can turn my points in for a prize.",1214000000

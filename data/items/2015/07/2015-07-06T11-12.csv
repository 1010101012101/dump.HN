If you ask in the IRC support channel, they will even tell you not to update if things work well! What if I need a new feature?<p>* Documentation is absurdly horrible or even plain wrong. I have been told several times to refer to the source code to find out how something works.<p>* If you face any problem, chances are you will never find an answer in Google. You may find some StackOverflow thread if you are lucky, where several clueless people argue about things they do not know and then arrive to a wrong conclusion. (The programming skill levels of Cordova users on those communities are usually very low.)<p>* Critical functionality (things such as local notifications) is not included. You must rely on 3rd party plugins, that could be well maintained, or could be not maintained at all.<p>Yes obviously a Cordova app does not look native. It&#x27;s not native and it will never be.

It&#x27;s likely that <i>most</i> commercial software a user uses these days started as a demo they were testing, maybe with a few features missing, or nag screens or a timer -- then they upgraded it to a full licensed copy. For whatever reason, we stopped calling it shareware, but that&#x27;s basically the model in use for closed-source commercial consumer-level software.<p>In many ways, shareware has become the &quot;default&quot; method for distributing commercial software, and it&#x27;s non-shareware software that&#x27;s kind of weird. This even happens on the high end. I worked for a desktop software company years ago, and we gave away our software on a 30-day trial, if they liked it, a seat cost $30k. It was called the &quot;30-till-30&quot; model by our sales guys who didn&#x27;t realize it was just shareware.<p>Looking at my own list of software I have installed right now:<p>Chrome - free with open source version<p>Firefox - open source + donationware<p>Thunderbird - open source + donationware<p>MS-Office - shareware<p>Foobar - open source + donationware<p>yed - free, but with commercial tools as part of the ecosystem, this makes it in my mind pseudo-shareware<p>Gimp - open source + donationware<p>Simcity 4 - fully commercial<p>Notepad++ - open source + donationware<p>Sublime Text 2 - shareware<p>FileZilla - open source + donationware<p>Mirc - shareware<p>Anki - similar model to yed, desktop version is free, mobile is paid<p>Bulk Rename Utility - donationware, closed source<p>Caustic - similar model to yed, desktop version if free, mobile is paid<p>Pycharm - shareware<p>renoise - shareware<p>bunch of steamgames - most started as a demo, so I&#x27;ll go with shareware<p>skipping over python, perl and the usual open source suspects<p>and on my phone: most started as a &quot;lite&quot; version so many of the apps are all shareware",1436183860

It&#x27;s almost identical to the system browsers now. Facebook&#x27;s comments about HTML5 were back in the dark ages when the webviews generally used horribly slow software rendering and didn&#x27;t have JIT for Javascript on iOS. It&#x27;s a completely different picture today. In fact, our performance-sensitive HTML5 game engine[1] targets the iOS 8 webview and Crosswalk for Android for making native apps, and they generally work as well as in the browser, which is very good, especially on newer devices. Modern web APIs are also asynchronous which helps offload work from the UI thread, and Web Workers can do that for arbitrary JS code too. For example our game engine runs A* pathfinding in a web worker, offloading any performance impact from the CPU intensive algorithm and running it in parallel to the game.<p>I think it&#x27;s time to stop accusing webviews of being slow.<p>[1] scirra.com",1436183534

But most of the lists include some version of fear, anger, disgust, and joy (but not sadness). &quot;Emotional Brain&quot; by Joseph LeDoux, chapter 5 has more info on various lists. From the same book:<p>James Averill, a major proponent of social constructivism, describes a behavior pattern, called “being a wild pig”, that is quite unusual by Western standards, but is common and even “normal” among the Gururumba, a horticultural people living in the highlands of New Zealand. The behavior gets its name by analogy. There are no undomesticated pigs in this culture, but occasionally, and for unknown reasons, a domesticated one will go through a temporary condition in which it runs wild. But the pig can, with appropriate measures, be redomesticated and returned to the normal pig life among the villagers. And, in a similar vein, Gururumba people can act this way, becoming violent and aggressive and looting and stealing, but seldom causing harm or taking anything of importance, and eventually returning to routine life. In some instances, after several days of living in the forest, during which time the stolen objects are destroyed, the person returns to the village spontaneously with no memory of the experience and is never reminded of the event by the villagers. Others, though, have to be captured and treated like a wild pig - held over a smoking fire until the old self returns […]<p>Averill uses “being a wild pig” to support his claim that “most standard emotional reactions are socially constructed or institutionalized patterns of response” rather than biologically determined events.",1436183390

9838293,comment,9837265,9837265,0,0,lesingerouge,,,"I have a bit of a science fiction scenario. Bear with me for a little bit.
Let&#x27;s suppose for a bit this approximate series of events was the actual goal of Mr. Varoufakis and company.<p>Why would they want this and who would want to risk the fate of an entire country and their own reputation on a &quot;gamble&quot;?<p>Because they started the negotiation game with a huge disadvantage and there was no way that they could bring something new to the table. So Tsipras and Varoufakis chose to &quot;play the dumb communist&quot; scenario that everyone was painting, stretch the canvas a bit and get new offers on the table and start with a different negotiating position.<p>This hypothesis, which I will check the following days, proposes that the Tsipras government and Varoufakis knew and understood very well the nature of the political and economical forces that pushed on them from outside of Greece. Knowing those forces and playing on the predictions laid out by the other side (Germany was already unhappy after Syriza won, expecting to have a difficult time negotiating with them) they followed to the line the &quot;predicted&quot; course. Difficult negotiations, huge differences in views, big political declarations and discourse, etc. The goal in the end was simple enough: get a cleaner slate.<p>Both the turbulent negotiations, with Varoufakis playing the evil marxist scapegoat, and the referendum, after a week of bank closures, were used as a ruse to lead the European leaders through to a &quot;clean slate&quot; phase. It was a very risky move, but I believe that the various contradictory signals that Tsipras sent just before the referendum confirm that it was a game. Like poker player that accidentally reveals his weakness just before he pulls a full house. The resignation of Varoufakis today is the next piece in their scenario: just take out the nasty opinionated communist and all the european parties will clearly feel more relaxed. I believe that this move was planned from the beginning and Varoufakis was used to &quot;stir up&quot; the pot a bit, while apparently being discarded as &quot;peace offering&quot; after a while.<p>So what was gained by this daring gamble? 
First of all, the markets were calmed. The negotiations were so desperate from the start, given the position of the two parties that everybody was sure of the Greek default. Now, with the financial markets accepting the default event in itself, any new deals on the table will have to take this fact into consideration. It&#x27;s not &quot;looming&quot; anymore, it is here and it is indisputable.
Second, the situation now allows for a much needed debt haircut. Refinancing is all fine and dandy, but everybody agreed that the debt could not be sustainably repaid. So now everybody is suddenly ok with the debt reducing. 
Third, the Tsipras government kept its word with its electors. They &quot;fought&quot; valiantly for the good of the people. Actually with the cards they got dealt by the previous government, they played quite a good game until now. And their general appeal has definitely risen from 36.3% (plus affiliated parties) to a 61% (as shown by the referendum).
Fourth, the european hard-liners were blind-sided and the rules for the negotiation were changed. The deal before this referendum was &quot;behave or we will strangle you&quot;. Now, it&#x27;s quite a useless threat given the actual default. So Tsipras most certainly will be able to have better terms.<p>Sorry for the long post, had a bit of thoughts to get out. :D",1436182244

Semi‐automatic and pump‐action shotguns and rifles were banned; a tax‐funded firearm buyback and amnesties saw over 700 000 guns surrendered from an adult population of about 12 million.<p>> The total firearm deaths, firearm homicides and firearm suicides had been falling in the 18 years preceding the new gun laws. In all, 13 mass shootings were noticed in the 18 years preceding the new gun laws.<p>> In the 10.5 years after the gun law reforms, there have been no mass shootings, but accelerated declines in annual total gun deaths and firearm suicides and a non‐significant accelerated decline in firearm homicides. No substitution effects occurred for suicides or homicides.<p>edit: it is interesting that they looked for substitution effects. Like `sdenton4` commented, the lethality of the weapon matters.<p>If it is difficult to access firearms and there isn&#x27;t really a similarly lethal alternative to easily kill someone else or yourself, it seems intuitively reasonable that we might expect to see less death.",1436181532

Oxytocine is responsible for the condition known as The Fanboy Syndrome. Whether by design, or by instinct, each utterance from the lips of Jason Fried and Davie Heinemeier Hansson carries a payload of powerful semiotic messages that alter the target's brain chemistry. Sometimes the target will become a Fanboy, and sometimes the target will feel a threat to a pre-existing Fanboy alliance---then comes the rage.<p>As members of the tech community, we endure constant oxytocine bombardment by masters of manipulation. With each new version of Android, with every semi-annual dose Steve Jobs charisma, with every shift in the Facebook security policy, in the Ruby vs Python vs Java flame wars, we are exposed to massive, and sometimes fatal, doses of harmful hormones. It's important to remember that we are not animals; we can take defensive measures. When next you feel your Fanboy or your Hateboy urge rising from the depths, do not resist it. Resistance is futile.

She typically cuts, pastes it right back to where she came from, and then goes to paste it again elsewhere.<p>That's a pro trick, I think. I consider myself a power user and I switched from copy+paste to cut+paste+paste a while ago. It gives me an extra kick of making sure the copy worked as intended.",1277409818

The templating of the dynamic data would happen on the browser-side machine.  This way, we could use really expensive compression algorithms with high CPU cost for compression, but then cache the compression result.<p>This could be achieved by using Javascript and fetching data as JSON, but it seems to be something that would be very useful and beneficial if it were standardized.",1277409800

Google Analytics and the vast majority of tracking systems would score this as a win for AdWords.  I'd like to be able to track it back to the win for organic SEO.  So I built a way to do that.  But I don't have good data on that yet, aside from one conversion which was literally the above example.<p>However, I have other ways of torturing the data to get at its secrets.  For example, my Halloween promotions (high volume, reaches way outside of my core customer segments) converted at a rate of 1.3%, just among web app users (which works out to several thousand in sales... and it would have been better without that pesky ""Ah whoopsie the signup button vanished in IE"" bug).<p>On the other hand, organic searchers coming for e.g. Spring bingo cards who sign up for the trial convert at 3.4%.  Sadly for me, they number less than a tenth of the Halloween deluge.<p>Looking at uber-niche organic search folks as a group, my conversion rate is better than 5%.<p>P.S. The ""canonical"" post on this subject, and the source of a lot of myths we have to kill in our industry, is the ""SXSW Web App autopsy"" from a few years back, featuring our friends at Wufoo among others.  Google it, you'll find it easily.",1274437456

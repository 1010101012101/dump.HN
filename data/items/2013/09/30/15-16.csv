Those customers are still there, and still buying iPhones (probably gold 5Ses now), and apps for them. But now there are way more, more price-sensitive consumers (the people buying those 5Cs, the people who still have an iPhone 4, etc.) and they have much the same buying behavior as (commodity) Android consumers.<p>In other words, there&#x27;s still money in the market -- but it&#x27;s a fixed supply of money (there are a fixed number of wealthy early adopters) vs. an ever-growing number of developers grabbing at it. The only way to get back to where we were would be to make a new app store that required new apps to be designed from scratch for the wealthy users to early-adopt all over again. (...and that&#x27;s fairly clearly what iOS7 is trying to do, isn&#x27;t it?)",1380556767

In Ottawa, Canada, for example, because it is the national capital there are three police forces with jurisdiction within the city: the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the federal gendarmerie force), the Ontario Provincial Police, and the Ottawa Police Service. As far as I know, and I live in Ottawa, it works out well.<p>But back to France. I imagine that IT costs are a small portion of the gendarmerie or police&#x27;s budget. Most of it would be taken up by wages for the officers and staff and maintenance of equipment and facilities. Merging France&#x27;s two police forces would do little to reduce those costs, since the combined organization would have the union of the two organizations&#x27; duties.",1380556562

Apps cost people something much more valuable than the small amounts of money in question: attention.  Most people find learning new software to be a chore.  So every app they download has a cost in attention, in learning how to use it, however simple that might be, and some of them have a cost in money as well.  If the app is free, they know they can abandon it instantly if it doesn&#x27;t give them value right away, and lose almost nothing. If it costs money, they will feel obliged to get more value out of it, but that means committing to spend even more attention.  When you buy a cup of coffee, you&#x27;re getting attention <i>back</i> because someone else is taking on the slightly fiddly business of making coffee, and once you have it, there is nothing to learn, you can just enjoy it.<p>Viewing software transactions as paying attention, rather than money, for value, makes a lot of these markets make more sense.  Because if you offer something that will reduce the net amount of attention they have to pay, they&#x27;ll often gladly give you money for it.",1380556120

You have made a hypothesis, now justify it.<p>I can come up with no scenario where that&#x27;s possible in the next 200 years. Indeed, the only way I can do it is to have a sizable population on Mars first, so it builds upon its own internal economy rather than through any sort of trade. It&#x27;s expensive to get people from Earth to Mars, and there needs to be a big enough population to be self-supporting, even in terms of education and training, so we&#x27;re talking generations to get to that point.<p>And if we can put a nucleus of 10,000 people on Mars, to start that colony, then we&#x27;ll have developed Earth-to-orbit technologies a lot better than we have now.<p>The explanation you gave - &quot;based on energy/transportation costs&quot; - has not a good predictor of industrial control in world history. Why should it be a given in the Solar System&#x27;s future history? What is the essential difference between space and ground?<p>At the very least, you have to show that life-support costs do not dominate the equation. Why wouldn&#x27;t we have automated mines on Mars, with at most a skeleton oversight crew? Why is it economically more feasible to have a self-supporting colony instead?<p>Over and over again, in reading about asteroid mining and Lunar and Martian colonization, the answer I read is at best &quot;we have no idea if it&#x27;s economically feasible&quot; and more often &quot;not economically feasible&quot;. While you posit that the answer is obviously weighted in favor of Mars, and not in need of further explanation.<p>Give me at least a vaguely reasonable scenario for how Mars becomes the natural industrial hub of the Solar System. Otherwise you&#x27;re handwaving your religion at me.<p>And for any argument you give, explain why the Moon isn&#x27;t a better choice.",1380554600

However that means <i>nothing</i> as development changes so much, especially on the web side of things.  For example PHP 5 (the only version you should use, <i>not</i> PHP4) only came out about 9 years ago.  I would hire you but ONLY when I see your coding skills. (Tip: if you don&#x27;t have a github account, get one now.  It is free and then you can also get ahead with thousands of other developers.  Also a &quot;see me on github&quot; on your CV will really stand out as a good thing.)<p>2.) It looks like you only have done HTML and CSS... both of these have changed so much that if you want to get serious with either of them you shouldn&#x27;t really use them in the &quot;traditional sense&quot;.  By that I mean that you should rather use a framework that works out really nicely.  Responsive design (works on all sized screens, mobile, iPad, etc) is currently a hot topic.  Try out Foundation.  It is a really cool framework for front end design. (and much easier to learn than Bootstrap) <a href=""http://foundation.zurb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foundation.zurb.com/</a><p>3.) If you want to do actual programming, I would still recommend PHP.  It is still the largest server side language... and hence more jobs available.  Just some companies that use it: Google, Facebook, Wikipedia, Amazon and Apple.  However whatever language you do end up using, if you want to get really good at it and get noticed in the job market find yourself a framework and get good at it.  For PHP I would recommend symfony2 <a href=""http://symfony.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symfony.com/</a> as it has by far the largest community.<p>To sum up with, I would say that if you push yourself really hard, keep abreast with the technologies and most importantly <i>practise coding</i> you should be rather good in just a few years",1380554197

On problems that are highly constrained (few/one feasible solution[s]) it would probably make more sense to try a constraint programming approach, but this particular problem has many (too many?) feasible solutions so I don&#x27;t think there is any reason to believe they&#x27;d be better.<p>One downside to MIP is the need to model the logical constraints as linear equations, which is perhaps less expressive than the way you can often express constraints in constraint programming languages.",1380554010

An interesting thing about this field is that although things change constantly, there are concepts that are transferable from one to the other. If you build a good foundation on those things and keep trying to learn new things,your age never enters the equation.<p>Since you already have a design background, I think it would be well worth your while to just learn how to use HTML, CSS and javascript effectively. You should be able to learn them inside and out in comparatively short amount of time compared to something like objective-C. There is also a big market for designers who can work with code (script?).",1380553318

A lot of these apps are being developed by programmers sitting in their underwear watching ESPN Gameday on Saturday morning. Or teenagers with nothing better to do. If they make money... well, that&#x27;d be great... but they really have other motivations.<p>That alone would flood the App Stores with product.<p>The second point, is economics.<p>ie - it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>If you live in an agrarian society... most likely, you have to be a farmer. It&#x27;s largely irrelevant how many other farmers there are... it&#x27;s probably the only thing you can do.<p>I think there is a similar dynamic in the app world. There are an AWFUL lot of unemployed programmers... chances are... they are going to ... well ... program. What else are they going to do with their time? It&#x27;s actually a pretty smart thing for them to do as well. Keeping the skills sharp and all that.<p>So... I think that&#x27;s, most likely, where a lot of the apps are coming from.

There isn&#x27;t one that takes a time_t. So we have to cast time_t to a type big enough to contain it, use the format specifier for that type, and we want this to be as cross-platform as possible, i.e. we use the oldest, most widely-supported type which can definitely hold at least 64 bits and has a standard printf specifier available. i.e. &quot;long long&quot;, exactly as in your example code.<p>So that&#x27;s why we prefer &quot;long long&quot; rather than &quot;int64_t&quot;, which I thought was your original question.",1380553266

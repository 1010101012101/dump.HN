My broader take is that you need gears and know when to change up/down. Sometimes you are going up hill and sometimes downhill. Sometimes you need to brake and sometimes steering is more important than speed. Ahhh car metaphores...",1405594793
8046836,comment,8046568,8046568,44,0,cconcepts,,,"There is something that feels a little dystopian about this article. Not in the George Orwell sense but more the Aldous Huxley sense. In Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; the masses are brought under control, not by force or direct intimidation, but by reducing them to decadence and self-indulgence.<p>To quote Wikipedia&#x27;s article on Brave New World as it discussed how the authorities maintain their totalitarian rule;\n&quot;Recreational sex is an integral part of society. According to the World State, sex is a social activity, rather than a means of reproduction and, as part of the conditioning process, is encouraged from early childhood. The few women who can reproduce are conditioned to use birth control, even wearing a &quot;Malthusian belt,&quot; a cartridge belt holding &quot;the regulation supply of contraceptives&quot; worn as a fashion accessory. The maxim &quot;everyone belongs to everyone else&quot; is repeated often, and the idea of a &quot;family&quot; is considered pornographic. Sexual competition and emotional, romantic relationships are rendered obsolete because they are no longer needed. Marriage, natural birth, parenthood, and pregnancy are considered too obscene to be mentioned in casual conversation. Thus, society has developed a totally different idea of relationships, lifestyle and reproductive comprehension.&quot;<p>People treat articles like this Tech Crunch piece as if they are somehow liberating but, to me, the tone of statements like this are soul-less: &quot;If you thought contraception brought on a sexual revolution, a world without sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy or social restrictions will for the first time in thousands of years allow us to mate in the way nature intended: without restriction&quot;.<p>Sure, the elimination of sexually transmitted diseases would be a great thing, but to herald it primarily for the potential of the self-centered orgy it might bring is downright depressing and reeks of a man who has never had meaningful sex.<p>The assumption &quot;as nature intended&quot; would pass as propaganda in Huxley&#x27;s writings.<p>I saw this quote from Neil Postman on HN some time ago and I think it is fitting in this instance:<p>&quot;What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny “failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.” In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.&quot;",1405594767

Students were being unfriendly and mean to each other for no other apparent reason than to climb the social ladder.  It also seemed like it was a goal to be disgusting - with indoor spitting, food-fights and generally gross behavior.  Not only kids, but also weak teachers were bullied.  Reciprocally, some teachers bullied weak students to an extent I consider clearly unprofessional.  And god forbid if you were gay or something (this was in the mid-nineties, so a while back now).<p>How refreshening it was to return to my native high school after that year!  Although it had is problem too, at least the norm among student was to be nice to each other.  Being &quot;cool&quot; was certainly a thing, but students generally weren&#x27;t obsessed about it.  I am generally nostalgic about my high school days, except the year in the US.<p>This is just my personal anecdote, and is of course ludicrous to say that &quot;bullying doesn&#x27;t exist in Europe&quot;, but I cannot help but wondering whether my experience fit into a pattern.

When you listen to what guys from IBM, Intel, Applied Materials etc. have to say, then it seems that 5nm will probably be the last silicon based process. III-V (Boron, Nitrogen group) type of materials will then be next, with most likely candidate being GaAs (Gallium arsenide) which is already being used in niche productions.<p>What is more interesting than semiconductor base used is lithography process. Deep UV (immersion, using refraction of medium such as water) lithography currently used is showing its limits for ever smaller features. So, they came up with Extreme UV lithography which uses mirrors to project features onto surface, because at that short wavelength everything is opaque. Applied materials has a machine with EUVL apparently (there is one on their site and a nice video with description) as well as ASML (their machine reportedly costs $88 million).<p>There is a probability that with new semiconductor base (group III-V) there will be a reset back to 22nm or similar and a race down to bottom once again.

Your mileage may vary, but i was homeschooled and the end of elementary and beginning of jr high. It was absolutely devastating to me socially. Socialization is honestly the most valuable thing i learned in high school.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t think that you can learn that many adults are horrible people without high school, and at least in high school there is limited damage that can be done, say, economically (of course there is always, on rare occurrences, and god forbid, potentially fatal emotional harm).<p>I sadly think that it may be that the younger these kids learn about society, the better. Humans are evolutionary beings, we have innate desires and drives, many of which are extremely anti-social. The sooner we learn that the better in my opinion.",1405591533

8899,comment,8814,8814,0,0,rfrey,,,"The following post falls squarely into the camp of PG's ""politically incorrect"" statements, and is likely to be widely reviled.<p>Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway has made most of its money by gaming the tax system through their insurance holdings.  Their success is not due to Coca Cola or Gillette, but from their purchase of Gecko and their subsequent ability to exploit tax loopholes, often to the benefit of other held companies.  An analysis of BH's investment history shows that, but their statements (despite WB's wonderful down-home messages) are miracles of obtuseness and require close readings.<p>I'm well aware of WB's stature as everyman's billionaire, but anyone thinking of joining the personality cult that his PR machine has created might consider some independent investigation.\n",1175719071

When they flew in for demo day, they looked like the plant that hadn't gotten the Miracle-Gro.  The upside of that rather expensive experiment was that it showed us how much YC helps people.",1175718687

Even if I cut all the corners, a hypothetical move to Boston would still cost me thousands of dollars.<p>If I was doing YC for a summer, I wouldn't need to <i>move</i>. I could just fly there with a couple of suitcases and a laptop, but I'd need some way to cover my existing apartment rent. That's a pretty significant expense over 3 months.

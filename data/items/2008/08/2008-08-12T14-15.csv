274043,comment,273887,273970,0,0,edw519,,,"<i>...actual methods described in most of the software engineering requirements books...</i><p>Thank you, Matt.  You have just demonstrated my number one concern about the nature of discourse here on hacker news.  The issue of ""book contents"" vs. real world experience.<p>I don't know you and certainly don't mean to pick on you,  but calling my criticism of Steve's article ""way off base"" merits this response...<p>First a little of my background.  Even though I've been a hacker my entire professional life, I had the good fortune to be mentored by an industrial engineer from a user department.  He did one thing extrememly well and taught me how to do it: solve business problems to make money.  This is the stuff that is rarely taught in <i>any</i> book, much less one that is ""considered by many to be a leading reference on the subject"".<p>Shocking as it may seem, many books on business systems and IT offer very little and many are simply wrong.<p>I have not read Karl Wieger's book and feel out of place evaluating it.  However, I did read the synopsis and all 45 reviews on Amazon.  Nowhere did I see mention of any of the things from my OP that <i>I know</i> work <i>every time</i>.  Instead I saw lots of mention of techniques like rational rose, entity-relationship diagrams, use cases, and modeling.  As anyone who has successfully conducted analysis will tell you, these techniques were never actually designed to achieve results; their purpose is to control the people and the process, not the outcome.<p>I stand by my original criticism of Steve's article.  He is dead wrong about analysis.  He doesn't respect it, probably because he doesn't know how to do it.  Your comment makes me wonder if the same holds true for you.",1218552904

We had a big meeting to talk about the new process for product management working with development, and the very first thing he did was play this sound clip.<p>As he put it, he could be more tactful, but the reality of business was that marketing was going to have a lot of unreasonable demands, and the measure of our success would be how we managed the unreasonableness.<p>I don't necessarily agree 100% that it is the role of product management and marketing to try to feature creep and bloat the product and schedule unreasonably, but my observation is that marketing and product management and clients and ""business"" in general always sound unreasonable :-)",1218552025

They came up with the idea (and by came up with, I mean saw Ebay) and it was my job to develop the site and figure out why people would use it over Ebay.

You don't want to waste effort evolving a process that's been badly distorted by existing software, when you could simplify the process immensely by writing something directly focused on the actual goal. This is an intensely creative/intuitive phase of the process, so it often takes several iterations (from a fresh state-of-mind each time).<p>Once you think have the perfect solution, go back and make sure that it solves all the problems noted in step 1.

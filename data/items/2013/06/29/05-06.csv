5961581,comment,5957850,5961199,3,0,creamyhorror,,,"I actually read and enjoyed a book in &#x27;97 that introduced MUDs, including LambdaMOO, so having you bring LambdaMOO up is no surprise. I read bits of that book you linked, and these parts near the end resonate:<p>---------------<p>...&quot;It&#x27;s not your fault,&quot; he said. &quot;But after you came looking for pelts, and traded trinkets with us, the covered wagons of conventional reality followed along the trails we&#x27;d blazed. The trails were cut by animals, the animals have been driven out by suburban sprawl. . . . How could it be otherwise?&quot;<p>Not surprisingly perhaps, Horton&#x27;s fellow anarch and rabble-rouser Finn is also unimpressed with Lambda&#x27;s current state of affairs, though his complaints, typically, are a little more down-to-earth. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing you can sink your teeth into these days,&quot; he says, pointing to a general absence of the sort of MOO-engulfing controversies he once thrived on. &quot;Politics I guess is dead. People have settled into the arbitration disputes; they get a kick out of that for a while, but they&#x27;re mostly frivolous disputes and people just wanting to get attention.&quot; Real life, meanwhile, has taken on more interest for Finn. He finally moved out of his parents&#x27; basement a couple years ago, setting out for Rochester, New York, to found an <i>Internet software business with some other MUDders he knew</i>, and once he got there, he also ended up in a serious RL relationship with a woman he had previously known only as Aurea on LambdaMOO. Two years down the road, both ventures appear to be going swimmingly. His company isn&#x27;t the next Netscape or anything, but it&#x27;s landed some respectable gigs, including a contract to run the official _Sally Jessy Raphael_ chat room; Finn and Aurea remain happily involved. His days as an online Casanova and all-around firebrand are pretty well over, but if he misses them much he doesn&#x27;t show it. He still MOOs daily, but he mostly just sits idling in Lambda House&#x27;s smoking room while he goes about his business at work. &quot;I&#x27;ve still got friends on Lambda, and it&#x27;s still fun,&quot; he says. &quot;But it&#x27;s not as much of a stage where you can play out your political ambitions and real arguments. It&#x27;s no longer really a metaphor for real life. It&#x27;s just not as passionate, I suppose.&quot;<p>...<p>He&#x27;d left his lousy secretarial job as well, his RL in general was gradually getting happier, and the happier it got the less he felt like spending time in virtual reality. &quot;In retrospect,&quot; he says, &quot;it&#x27;s evident to me just how much <i>the misery of my real life</i> (and not my intellectual curiosity, or my gender-role issues, or whatever) was the thing that made VR seem so dazzling back inna the day.<p>&quot;Then there was also the fact that VR had started to seem tacky,&quot; he adds. &quot;By &#x27;96 it seemed like <i>every yutz in the world was on the Internet</i>, &#x27;living the fantasy.&#x27; Whatever <i>elitist pioneer spirit</i> had seemed to me to permeate Lambda back in &#x27;91 or &#x27;92 was completely gone. I missed that, and Interzone was marginal compensation at best.&quot;<p>And so he just stopped going, basically. He let his spares die out, reaped one by one as he let them lie, and he now logs on to Lambda once a month, at most, to check his MOO-mail. It&#x27;s enough for him. &quot;I&#x27;m teaching prep-school English and living in Austin with a woman I really like,&quot; he tells me. &quot;My life is pretty simple now. <i>I feel like I&#x27;ve grown up a lot.</i>&quot;<p>...<p>Weary though she may be, however, she doesn&#x27;t regret her involvement in the political debates that ultimately exhausted her. &quot;I&#x27;m way beyond sick of theorizing about cyberspace,&quot; she says, &quot;and have become completely anti-utopian about VR, but all in all <i>the experience has been good for me</i>. It&#x27;s made me a much better writer . . . encouraged me to go out and get myself published. It&#x27;s also given me a social presence IRL in a way I never used to think I had. After all the practice I got taking stands, making points, influencing audiences who were sometimes incredibly hostile, grad student seminars, for instance, came to seem comparatively amazingly easy places to formulate and express arguments.&quot;<p>-------------<p>Here we see the end of involvement (or infatuation) with a virtual world playing out: with finding real life more interesting and enriching. Maybe that&#x27;s the lesson of virtual worlds - whether MUDs or EVE Online - you eventually tire of them and leave, but they change you and set you on new paths (to another career, or a business).<p>I guess I need to take the nostalgia goggles off and realize things won&#x27;t be the same the second time round.",1372484310

5961557,comment,5951589,5960787,1,0,kijin,,,"I think we&#x27;re getting way off topic, but anyway:<p>1. It&#x27;s my understanding of the present state of affairs in most countries. Apart from religious law, it is rare for criminal statutes to include a clause like &quot;No person shall murder another.&quot; People do tend to interpret &quot;Murderers shall be put in prison&quot; as &quot;Thou shalt not murder&quot;, but IMO the latter is an assumption behind the law, not its content. All the lawmakers already assume that murder is wrong. The law&#x27;s job is to decide how to discourage murders, what to do when murder happens, etc.<p>2. The set of objective moral imperatives that exist at all times and places, and their application in particular circumstances, should exhaust the set of all the moral imperatives that we are ever obliged to obey. By &quot;all times and place&quot; I mean &quot;even in times and places where the state does not exist&quot;, because that&#x27;s the condition in which humans lived for the majority of their existence on Earth. So I don&#x27;t think it even makes sense for there to be a moral imperative that only exists in certain circumstances (e.g. the state) unless it is an application of an all-times-and-places moral imperative. But I cannot seem to find an all-times-and-places moral imperative that could be applied in such a way as to justify obedience to the laws of a state <i>just because</i> they are the laws of a state.<p>3.

Targeting high speed traders gave BATS an advantage because those are the customers that make exchanges money - both because of volume, and the specific types of orders they use. High speed traders traditionally try to avoid the automated routing that traditional orders go through to match and fill. A high speed trader would like to know the fees with certainty, and routing opens up the risk of unexpected fees. Therefore, many high speed traders mark their trades for no routing. This benefits the exchanges since the liquidity stays on their exchange and they will collect the fees when/if it fills.",1248803610

In that case it is not socially acceptable to spend $4,000 on the dog.   To note your other examples, it also irresponsible to borrow $4,000 at 25% interest to go to movies or spend on overseas tourism.<p>Note that I am not just claiming that it is unwise and irresponsible (it is); I am also claiming ""social acceptance"" in that society in some sense backs this up.  My evidence is this: if you bring a child in need of $4,000 in care to a doctor, and don't have $4,000, the child will get the care; you may be dunned for the bills, but the child gets fixed.<p>You bring a dog into a vet, and you are indigent, the dog either gets given away to someone who will pay or it gets the needle.<p>My personal views go further, in that even someone who has $4,000 is being irresponsible by spending it on a dog (in most cases - a breed in threat of extinction or a highly trained dog might be worth it, I am sure many seeing eye dogs are worth $4,000 and not replaceable for that).  But I know that many people hold the opposite, and would even say you should not own a dog if you are not willing and able to pay $4,000 on vet expenses.<p>If you have to borrow at 25%, then you fail the ""able"" part of ""willing and able"".<p>One of the things that will come out of the current economic situation is that our society is going to be less accepting of people who do things like borrow $4,000 to spend on pet bills.",1248802023

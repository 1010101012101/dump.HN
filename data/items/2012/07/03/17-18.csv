How many of them do you think know how to formulate a Moore machine, convert it to a Mealy machine, explain the differences between a finite automaton and a Moore machine, how to negate lambda transitions, produce a context free grammar...seriously, if you are the sort who, when given a problem, thinks of FSMs and Moore machines as a first level abstraction, are able to construct a delta transition function as the cartesian product of the set of input states Q times the set of input alphabets sigma...you are so far ahead of the rest of the pack in both theoretical competence and intellectual ability...you wouldn't even bother with nonsense like MVC at that point.<p>There was a generation where these things were formally taught...but that ship has sailed. The people who get worked up about MVC in web frameworks these days are in the same boat for whom Microsoft once built the FrontPage wysiwyg html editor, because they were too busy to grok the bold and italic tag. Ofcourse a REST api can be modelled using an FSM. But then, so can addition. Division. Subtraction. Arithmetic.

4195194,comment,4193516,4193516,27,0,rads,,,"One problem with a state machine approach compared to MVC is that it isn't as familiar. Do you use a Moore or a Mealy machine? A combination of the two? Most people don't use state machines to model the flow of an entire web application, so if you try it out, you might feel like you're on your own.<p>It can be worth it, though. I used state machines for a client-side UI in ClojureScript a few months ago. It forced me to think hard about the structure and flow of the app. But after that, my state was in an explicit, contained area. If I had been using something like Backbone, the state would have been hidden among the various model objects. I felt like I had a much better mental model of how the program worked after the initial design process. Keeping state in control reduces complexity. [1]<p>Another benefit was that the state machine library I used allowed me to audit the trail of states as they happened. When a user toggled a checkbox to trigger an event, I could look in the JS console and see the moment the checkbox was triggered. If something wasn't working, I could often debug it by seeing if the states and transitions happened in the right order. I wouldn't be able to do this with a traditional MVC framework.<p>There's one very important thing that nobody has mentioned yet: state machines look ugly in your code. When they get big, they are difficult to follow. I started out using a state machine library that was just too simple. Once the interactions became complex, I was getting lost in my code. I looked for a clearer, more succinct way of modeling state machines, and eventually I came to Harel statecharts. [2]<p>Statecharts are a way to model state machines without explicitly writing out a ton of redundant states. The number of states becomes a problem when you actually try to model an application with a basic non-deterministic FSM. If you're interested in using state machines in your web application, you <i>need</i> to read the linked paper. The example of modeling a digital watch with statecharts makes it easier to see how you could use them in a web app.<p>I believe statecharts are to MVC as Clojure is to every mutable state language out there. It feels weird at first, but once you get used to it, it's much simpler. It's just not necessarily easier. [3] If you want to try them out, there's a good library called Stativus for writing statecharts in JavaScript: <a href=""https://github.com/etgryphon/stativus/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/etgryphon/stativus/</a><p>[1] See ""Out of the Tarpit"" for why state and complexity are closely related: <a href=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/249607/all/Out%20of%20the%20Tarpit.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/249607/all/Out%20of%20the%20Tarpit....</a> (The original link is down, so I made a mirror.)<p>[2] The original article on statecharts: <a href=""http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/SCANNED.PAPERS/Statecharts.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/SCANNED.PAPERS/Stat...</a><p>[3] More about the idea that simpler things are not necessarily easier: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>",1341337174

You've abstracted some application functionality into the data storage, ok.<p>I'm speaking to the point that if you are separating Model, View, and Controller, and you have complex objects in your model that can do many things, it would not make sense to put all of the logic about what those things can do, how to do them, and when to do them in the model.  Otherwise, you're simply blending the model and the controller (which may not be a wrong thing to do) - so you just have MV.<p>Let me give a more concrete example: I have a model which represents a network of connected complex ""devices,"" there are five types of devices, each that can do 50 distinct things.  The model can add a new device, delete a device, or retrieve an existing device.  It can also ask the devices what their names, and addresses are, and what features they support, on behalf of any view which needs that information.<p>It cannot, however, tell device 1, which is of type X to take action ""foo"".  That, instead, is implemented by a controller attached to a view that shows a big button that says ""Do Foo"", and a drop-down with the list of available devices that can do Foo.  The view passes the press of the button onto the controller, which asks the model for the selected device, and then executes a ""do Foo"" command on it, and then, perhaps, contacts the device again to check that ""Foo"" was completed.<p>If all such logic were built into the model, I'd have several hundred methods in it, and I'd be very quickly looking for somewhere to move all of this logic, like, you know, controllers.",1341336720

However, I actually am fairly certain that Installer did.

Had you actually been there, in the field, developing for the platform at the time, you might not consider the opinion so naive. I agree, however, that people oft fail to look at how long it takes to accomplish things like this, and somehow take the release date as the point of inception: but here we could actually watch the progress.<p>Regardless, it might be they had it ""on the horizon"" (although I'd even question that, after years of talking about this story with people at conferences), but the idea that it was going to happen at that point--sufficiently early and with sufficient unknowns that they actually slipped on their release dates (not thforties slips got much press)--for that first device.. to me that is far-fetched (but I sadly realize that most of my evidence is not transferable).",1341336599

Do you use stack ranking?  If the answer is yes then you know they aren't performance based.<p>Microsoft and Amazon both seem to think it is ""scientific"". It isn't really scientific when, in advance, you decide that %10 should be on a firing track, %70 should be warned and %20 should be promoted-- without regard to actual performance.<p>Bezos likes to run around claiming he only hires ""A players"", but what it ended up being was C & D[1] players who didn't know how to program or understand technology, ranking their teams, almost completely based on office politics[2] and ones ability to hype their work, rather than the actual technical quality of the work.   Of course generalizations like this will have exceptions and I knew some groups who were lead by software developers who got promoted, and the AWS group seemed to be insulated from the amazon culture.  But HR and Management at Amazon.com were absolutely atrocious.  And that's in comparison to Microsoft (where I also worked) where this ""metrics"" religion was completely accepted as well.<p>If you're a talented engineer, work for a startup, but if you need a big company and you're in the northwest, pick Microsoft before you pick Amazon.

I saw the Kindle at Amazon about a year(?) before it was announced and wanted to kill it on the spot. (not that I had any say in the matter)   I thought it looked like it was designed in the USSR.  Still do, but bad design can still make for a good product financially (and it has gotten better.)<p>[1] I'm being generous here. My boss and my bosses's boss and all the HR people I'd give an F. Absolutely the most incompetent people I've worked with in 20 years of mostly working with startups where even really competent people have to struggle with immense difficulties and uncertainty, neither of which was present at Amazon, except to the extent created by incompetence, though this incompetence went all the way to the top.   I saw other people leading other teams who were C & D players, so I presume my team was just particularly bad.<p>[2] (Talking about amazon here, saw much less of this at MSFT. MSFT was more misguided than... evil.) In order of decreasing effectiveness: Kissing Bezos's ass, Kissing your manager's bosses ass, kissing your manager's ass, kissing your manager's peers ass, making up initiatives that sounded really effective, even if they had no actual effect and then propagandizing them around the company, sabotaging your co-workers products, knifing your co-workers in the back verbally, deliberately mistranslating instructions from your boss to others in the team, hyping yourself with other teams, conspiring with others at other teams, and just generally lying.  I saw all of this occur.  If I'm bitter it is because I was not smart enough to accept that this was the companies culture, and I gave them way too much benefit of the doubt.

For example, if someone delivers well, but is an asshole in the process, do they get rewarded? If they do, then that is the behavior that will be emulated and replicated throughout the company, as that is the behavior that is encouraged. If someone does a good job, delivering for their team, working well with our organizations and providing insight and value to many different projects, and this is rewarded, then this is emulated. It is classic behavioral psychology.<p>It isn't in your advantage to make your coworkers look bad, it is in your favor to make them look great, because they review you! You can ask different people for feedback and reviews, provdiding a great opportunity for growth. I have to agree with you in that it could create a toxic work environment, but I don't see that happening, and there doesn't seem to be much stress or strain around the process. Sure, there are worries, receiving feedback both negative and positive is not comfortable by any means, but the fundamental purpose is for everyone to get better, do better, and to have people rewarded for doing well!",1341336231

A significant amount of basic research in a bunch of fields (like cosmology and more abstract mathematics) is done on public funding. Why? It's simple: companies and individuals rarely want to invest in such ventures because there is no guarantee they will be useful in any reasonable time frame. And yet this is doubtless a good investment for the future--we are much better off thanks to mathematical developments that most people would have thought too abstract initially.<p>If you asked the people on the street to fund research in category theory (before it got all popular :P), nobody would have done it.

Yeah the 4th place finisher is an amazing athlete, but there are only three medals.<p>Suppose you are a manager who manages 5 employees.  If you have $100K to give out as bonuses, you could just divide it up equally.  Over time employees would come to expect to get their bonus and it would cease to be a motivator.<p>While stack ranking imposes a bit of an assumption about the distribution of effort/merit on a team, it's also intended to foster spirited competition for the top spots, much like the medal system used in the olympics.<p>If you are managing a meritocracy and the rules of the game are known, nobody will begrudge someone else getting a bigger bonus.  Many workers idealize working on a team where they are not the strongest, so that they can learn from others.<p>The point is that it's not just about rewarding people, its about rewarding people for the kind of significant contributions to the team that make a business difference.  If managers are letting it get political and it turns into a BS metric, then that's evidence of a larger management problem than a problem with the particular distribution of bonuses entailed by the program.<p>One could argue that any bonus that is uncertain has the potential to alienate the employee if it is not earned.  The converse would be to give all employees motivational bonuses, or, in other words, not to give bonuses but to rename some of the guaranteed compensation ""bonus"" when it's actually just salary.<p>If a corporate culture is so backward that the genius in the next cube getting a bonus is viewed as a bad thing, then it's probably time to think about how/why bonuses (or the equivalent) are given in a smaller business where the bonus comes in the form of options being worth something, etc.",1341335494

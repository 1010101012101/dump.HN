Everyone should know that a company run by co-CEOs is unlikely to be permanent.  This also helps with recruiting since outside candidates know they have a legitimate shot.<p>2) Set up explicit competition between the two biggest contenders to win the slot.  I personally believe this is dirty and guarantees the loser to leave (which I think is net bad -- the loser was a contender for CEO for a reason).<p>3) Reduce the need to fill someone's shoes.  By giving what was one person's job to two people, those two people can focus on their areas and excel individually without unfair comparisons to their predecessor.  This is especially important when the predecessor was a public figure.  Think Tim Cook comparisons to Jobs.

5301344,comment,5300255,5301223,13,0,ahoyhere,,,"If you believe that McDonalds is the only one stuffing natural-looking food with HFCS, you are mistaken. And while educated people expect fast food burgers to be bad for you, the salads look like a smarter, reasonable choice (even though they often have more calories than the burger, even though the chicken is injected not all places require calorie counts on the menu.) You will also find that many sit-down restaurants give the same preparation to their meat.<p>Time and time again has shown that every health (or financial) crisis starts with moralizing. Which never works. Only when reform and legislation occur do things get better. But it's an appealing strategy because it feels good to the moralizer, and doesn't take any work.<p>The food industry knows what it's doing, does it on purpose [1], with government dollars. Government subsidies to individuals go to processed foods (because natural ingredients <i>are</i> more expensive), then those government dollars also end up in the pockets of corporations using government money to undercut prices thanks to industry corn subsidies.<p>Even if everyone were suddenly to start cooking all their meals and never eating out or buying any premade ingredients, that raw chicken at your local grocery store is also a lot less benign that you think. Most whole chickens are injected with all kinds of things.[2] At Whole Foods in NYC, I once bought a (very small) organic chicken that cost $16.<p>Of course, cooking home meals requires A) living in a place where you can cook, B) growing up understanding cooking is an option, C) understanding that food can even be dangerous, D) not living in one of America's many, very large food deserts [3]. And that's assuming you're not relying on government assistance to feed your baby or should we say, feed your baby corn syrup? [4] And let's not forget school breakfasts and lunches for poor kids.[5]<p>Oh sure, in a perfect world, everybody has perfect information and the ability to spend a lot of time researching and thinking about their food. Not to mention access to grocery stores with healthy food. But in THIS world, you've got an ouroboros of government money funding and institutionalizing a crisis: from government subsidies to produce HFCS lowering the cost of very unhealthy and addictive foods, to government money paying for baby formula laced with HFCS made by the companies that benefit from the government subsidies for growing corn (a delicious double dip). Government cheese is even more addictive than HFCS. Hence, legislation.<p>[1] Certainly not the canonical reporting on the problem, but this NYT article about the intentional design of addictive food just came out yesterday <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/04/opinion/la-ed-chicken4-2010jan04"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/04/opinion/la-ed-chicke...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://wicwoes.com/2011/corn-syrup-for-babies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wicwoes.com/2011/corn-syrup-for-babies</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://foodidentitytheft.com/vegetable-or-not-school-lunch-pizza-still-chemical-laden/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foodidentitytheft.com/vegetable-or-not-school-lunch-p...</a><p>EDIT: One last thing. Not only is HFCS/CS a major ingredient in such seemingly trustworthy, reputable foods such as Mott's Apple Sauce, and probiotic yogurt, it's also found in pet food. Yes, pet food. I recently adopted a cat with an autoimmune problem and I ended up researching pet health issues. Pet diabetes is increasing terribly.[6] Cats have other health problems caused by the fact that it's nearly impossible to get pet food, no matter how expensive, without biologically unnecessary sugars and starches -- which cats, pure carnivores, not only don't need, but suffer from. Dogs don't need corn syrup, either.<p>[6] <a href=""http://blog.sfgate.com/pets/2011/05/04/new-pet-health-report-diabetes-increasing-faster-in-dogs-than-in-humans/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sfgate.com/pets/2011/05/04/new-pet-health-report...</a>",1362088593

Over the years that is the biggest mistake that I have seen people make in negotiation.<p>I'll give you an example with domains. I'm in the process of buying a domain for a startup and the startup will pay $50,000 maybe even $100,000 for the domain. But the owner won't even engage preferring to shoot for the stars and thinks he will get a million. He won't even state a price. At this point we will cut bait and find another name. I know fully well this business (I also own names) and I know that this domain has about a 2% chance of selling for anywhere near that amount in coming years. I have domains that I've held for 15 years and have never gotten a single offer on. I've had domains that I've held for 15 years that I've sold for big money. Anytime someone comes along with a serious offer I focus on how long it will take until the next offer will come in - if ever. Business and gambling are two different things.",1362088557

And there are better regularization techniques for backprop now--weight decay, momentum, L1/L2 regularization, dropout, probably more that I'm leaving out.<p>The pre-training (RBM or autoencoder) helps to not get stuck in local minimas, but there's also interesting research that suggests you're not even getting stuck in local minima so much as you're getting stuck in these low slope, high curvature corridors that gradient descent is blind to, so people are looking into second order methods that can take curvature into account so you can take big steps through these canyons and smaller steps when things are a bit steeper.  Or something like that :-)<p>All that being said, anyone care to weigh in on the pros/cons of RBMs vs something like a contractive autoencoder?  No such thing as a free lunch, so what are the key selling points of RBMs at this point?  I keep seeing them pop up, but afaik, they don't provide a particular advantage over autoencoder variants.<p>Great article though, I'm really glad to see more and more people getting interested in neural networks, they've come a long way and people are just starting to wake up to that.",1362088531

I enjoy proving myself wrong, since it means I've probably learned something.<p>The logic is this: evolution is supreme.  It's why our eyes see brightness logarithmically rather than linearly.  In fact, every sensory input (sound, etc) except pain is logarithmic.  Pain is linear.  We see green more intensely than other colors because we've spent a long time hunting for prey that hides in green grass and green tree leaves.  Evolution determines the very nature of our thinking patterns.  It's why some people count ""out loud"" to themselves in their heads, whereas others count by ""seeing"" the numbers in their heads.  Etc.  There are at least thousands of examples of how evolution has forged our state of being.<p>Evolution determines so much of our nature that in comparison we have very little control over aspects of ourselves.  One thing we do control is input to our bodies.  We can control whether we watch TV, and we can control which foods we eat.  The question here is, which foods should we eat?<p>One view is that if we eat foods we've been eating for the past million years, then we probably don't have to worry about which foods we eat.  The answer is simply, ""Eat any which haven't been designed by humans in the past 10,000 years.""<p>In the USA, foods are required by law to list every ingredient.  This is a huge advantage if one were to read them.  If I see corn starch, soy, sugar (if it's added as an ingredient, then that means the food is artificial), etc, then I don't buy it.<p>It's incredible how many foods are excluded by this method.  You almost can't find ham that hasn't had sugar added.  I pretty much have to buy summer sausage, pork steaks, and chicken.  No more bologna.",1362088510

A lot of people/businesses used him and after some time started asking whether he could put together websites for them (you know, because all computer work is roughly the same).  Well, he looked me up and I joined him as the web team.<p>I came on looking to expand on my development abilities, but I soon realized that very little of the is spent actually sitting and programming.  There was meeting with customers, getting requirements, creating some sort of plan then figuring out how to break it all into a roadmap/schedule where the delivery is satisfactory and on the proper date.  I had little to zero experience in any of those tasks.<p>I struggled to gain comfort during meetings and lacked confidence while I would be setting up the schedule, I assume it stemmed from my beginner status and an overall lack of successfully completed tasks to look back on (whether as a sub-contractor or just even hobby projects).<p>There were times I'd ask my father for advice (he had started a company that was rather successful), read a book or two, tried some online resources, but really, I was probably just too young and not wired to be a sub-contractor at that point in my life.  Sometimes I do look back and see the mistakes I made and what I could have done to correct them, so in a way, it was a great learning experience - but not in the area that I wanted.<p>I've since done some ""internships"" (one where I was paid less than minimum wage and worked full days - but I really wanted a job experience) and realized that I came away with way more than I could have ever discerned from my experiences as a sub-contractor.  However, I strongly believe this was due to the fact that I wasn't all that great development back then.  Nowadays, I find that the business aspects come a lot easier now that my programming/development understanding are eons beyond what they were even 4-5 years ago.<p>I should also make certain to mention that my experiences are my own - I wouldn't be surprised if someone younger than I were thrust into that situation and would came out successful.

See ""Structure From Motion"" and ""Optical Flow"" for more information about this. Note that this is technology that is used in some video codecs. You may have noticed in some corrupted videos, the corruption artefacts can sometimes move as if they are mapped on a detailed 3d model of the moving objects. But really all it is are 2D motion vectors moving blocks of color around on a predetermined optical flow path.<p>In this algorithm, exaggerating that same 2D optical flow path has the perceptual effect of somehow ""knowing"" something about the 3d geometry. you could more accurately say the original motion is constrained by the 3D geometry.<p>(more)

Nor is it Symfony or Yii or Laravel or Zend or the framework I'm building in my spare time which is still not quite as ugly as Flow. This article's argument is as arbitrary as it its conclusion is irrelevant.<p>The reasons PHP is not, and will not soon be, dead have to do with its ubiquity and utility in its one and only purpose -- preprocessing html.

You wanna like him, you wanna see Groupon succeed.<p>We get to the part of the talk where questions are asked and answered. He answers some early softballs. Then one brave soul stood up with a real query that only Mason could answer.<p>Is Groupon a sustainable business, given what we'd been hearing from merchants online?<p>It was as if a mask had dropped. Where once there was cheer and energy, there was now a sullenness. The man seemed <i>affronted</i> at the notion that his business would be challenged in this way. Despite the fact the opportunity to ask just such a question was one of the great values of a venue of this sort. Despite the fact that Groupon's sustainability had been the elephant in the room the whole time. This was right after some of the first stories from distressed Groupon merchants had been trickling out.<p>Petulant, absent all of his previous ebullience, Mason asserted the business was sustainable, offered no supporting details, and demanded the next question.<p>A good leader has the intellectual honesty to recognize their missteps and explain them, along with the remedies explored. The expectation for that is even more acute when you've been elevated to the role of mentor.<p>It was in that moment, his phoniness laid bare, that I decided Groupon was likely melting puppies in its basement, Mason knew it, and didn't know how to reverse the operation.",1362088249

I've found that a greater risk by <i>far</i> is predictable modularization, a topic with much less ""engineering"" attention. Any decent-sized project is going to have to decompose their presentation declarations info manageable artifacts, which has the unwanted side-effect of spreading out existing selectors across multiple files. Add to this a tight project timeframe, several engineers that treat CSS as a second-rate language (as almost all that I've encountered do, worsening the more senior they are), and CSS' lack of selector-spacing (in the namespace sense), and you have a recipe for thermonuclear battles over selector specificity.<p>Selector and naming conventions can basically eliminate this problem. Module root elements have a class name that starts with a letter; module nested elements have a class name that starts with a dash. These are combined with the child selector to constrain their applicability.<p>What was once super-ambiguous, e.g.<p><pre><code>  body { color: black; }
  .menu .item { color: orange; }
  .menu .item .menu { color: black; }

Their support was unable to provide any real resolution to this and so I moved elsewhere. On recollection, I should have asked for my money back. Not for the meaningful amount that it cost, but to highlight how stupid this practice is. I'd encourage anyone with name.com to do the same as a form of protest.<p>A previous series of support emails:<p>--<p>I own the joshka.net domain registered with name.com.
When I attempt to resolve a subdomain that does not exist I expect this to
return a NXDOMAIN result.
Instead, the name.com name servers return an IP address of spammers.<p>How can I setup my account to return NXDOMAIN for this domain?<p>--<p>Hello Joshua,<p>I have set your domain to a wildcard 'A' record, that accepts any
subdomain, and points it to your hosting IP address. I ran a 'dig' [ping]
command on 'stuff.joshka.net' as a test, please see the results below:<p>--<p>I think we have a slight misunderstanding. I do not want a wildcard A record
(and have removed the record that was setup).
Resolving any subdomain that I have not explicitly created a DNS record
should return a NXDOMAIN result.
This expectation is in line with ICANN's memorandum titled ""Harms and
Concerns Posed by NXDOMAIN Substitution (DNS Wildcard and Similar
Technologies) at Registry Level"" at
<a href=""http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-2-24nov09-en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-2-24nov09...</a>
Providing this default wildcard service where it is not requested or
required is a disservice. I can't imagine why I would want or need this.<p>--<p>Hello Joshua,<p>I apologize for the misunderstanding with the wildcard DNS record. We have had multiple customers request this in the past, and this feature was used with success in those cases. I have consulted our management team to see if there is a different option that we can provide you. Please look for a response concerning this issue tomorrow.<p>--<p>Thanks Elicia,
I'll look forward to hearing from you.
It's not the wildcard DNS itself that I couldn't see the use of. I
understand why that would be useful in narrow situations.
What I don't understand is why name.com provide the default wildcard A
record redirecting to a site full of advertising. I don't know how this
would be useful to any business or entity that does not want to use wildcard
subdomains of their own.<p>I understand that section 19 of the registration agreement seems to cover
this use of wildcards (though the wording is fairly vague), but it also
states ""At any time, you may disable the placeholder page by updating,
modifying or otherwise changing the name servers for the relevant domain
name.""<p>--<p>Thanks for getting back with us. Yes you are correct, by changing the DNS or name servers for this domain, it will no longer point to the parking page.
I have discussed all options for allowing this wording to show, with our support management team, and the systems administration group. We sincerely apologize, however our DNS servers are not able to show the 'nxdomain' that you mentioned.<p>This option is possible should you wish to use your own custom name servers for this domain. Should you wish to setup your own name servers, here are instructions for registering these name servers from within your Name.com account<p><snip>",1362087116

Rather than take the easier short-term path, which may eventually put Linux's metaphorical balls into a Microsoft vice, he would rather expose some pain now to defend as much as possible long-term autonomy. I would imagine this to be true given Torvald's historic ability to keep Linux healthy and viable in spite of one of the world's most powerful corporations.<p>Thus, in the short term, the user must perform some gymnastics to boot new kernels, but if this inconvenience is really that painful, it will create market disequilibrium that will motivate creative solutions. Some naive, off-the-cuff ideas:<p>- vendors pre-installing trusted root certs for Linux distros or a consortium of them,<p>- vendors making it easy to disable SecureBoot (physical switch?),<p>- vendors forcing SecureBoot configuration/opt-in on very first boot,<p>- UI, tools, or documentation enhancements to make local key management and signing easier, or<p>- simply a slightly more aware userbase (the same way phone locking/unlocking became a mainstream concept).",1362085921

I'm glad the smoking gun has been found.<p>High fructose corn syrup is in virtually everything people buy to eat. It needs to go. Enough people's lives have been ruined. The design and engineering of prepared foods people commonly buy is toxic and addictive.<p>Now we need to re-educate people and make sure long-held views are erased. People have long blamed gluttony for obesity and obesity for diabetes. We now know it isn't true and that the super-sugars we are being force-fed are the culprit. We must all, together, demand that processed sugars such as high-fructose corn syrup be banned or, at the very least, severely restricted. I don't use the words force-fed lightly. Those among us who are on food stamps or a limited income have no choice but to buy the cheapest foods. Those are the ones that most commonly have the highest amount of sugars added. Anyone with a busy lifestyle eats out a lot. Fast foods, including the ones that claim to be ""better,"" are laced with sugars, sodium, and fat.<p>We must demand policies that protect us from harm and the greed-driven irresponsible practices of Big Food.<p>Thank you, Mr. Bittman, for keeping us informed.
""""""<p>So is ""Big Food"" the new scapegoat? I guess the next article we'll see a comment proclaiming how ""Big Grocery"" prices unhealthy foods too low, so now it's their fault.<p>This is a great study, and it's results are extremely interesting, but this article, and the inferences people are getting from it border on witch trials. The article does a great job of doing everything but coming out and saying what the commenter does ""They're force feeding us toxins!"". There is such a clear departure from responsibility in today's culture it's almost astonishing. The blame lies 100% with nobody, but the individual has just as much a part to play as those producing the food.<p>Edit: Does anyone notice the language used in the comment? ""Force-fed"", ""re-educate"", ""We must all, together"", ""Enough people's lives have been ruined"". It sounds almost like something from 1984.<p>Also, look how easily the commenter provides inclusion to victimhood... anyone ""with a busy lifestyle"", or those who ""are on food stamps or a limited income"". Limited income is pretty broad. It's interesting also, how they ""have no choice but to buy the cheapest foods"".",1362085759

Clearly it cannot possibly be their portions that are to blame, but rather society, big bones, genetics, and now the food itself being ""toxic"". Anything to avoid reality.</i><p>This paragraph demonstrates a widely held, thinly veiled contempt for those with a less fortunate metabolism.  This contempt is disgusting, because it is willfully ignorant of all the scientific research that indicates there is a lot more than mere willpower that determines a person's behavior, including eating habits.<p>As with any religiously held position of superiority, people will continue to justify this contempt with all manner of carefully worded excuses for their desire to feel better than those fat people over there.  When does it end?<p><i>I think it is no coincidence that the sensational spin the news has put on this story also happens to be a spin that makes their readers feel better about themselves.</i><p>What point are you trying to make?  That the news should be trying to make people hate themselves more than they already do?  Good grief!  This research isn't about justifying behavior, it's about identifying the chemical processes driving various metabolic phenomena so they can be controlled and corrected!<p>You know what about this reseasrch would make an obese reader feel better about himself or herself?  It's the fact that, finally, someone has identified a specific mechanism that is causing their problems!  It's the hope that comes from having a direction of attack that's more effective than self deprivation.",1362085300

What seems disrupting in a negative way to some people can make others' lives simpler. Removing the obstacles to gay marriage (or legalizing, but that sort of implies that it wasn't already a constitutional right) is one such case.",1362085293

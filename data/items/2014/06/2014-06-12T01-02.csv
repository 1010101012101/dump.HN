7881450,comment,7880676,7880887,2,0,Pxtl,,,"I think &quot;send&quot; vs. &quot;share&quot; is a good point.  Email/SMS/DM/IM all have a recipient - they&#x27;re <i>messages</i> that are sent.<p>A social network or blog does not.  They&#x27;re objects that are <i>shared</i>.<p>Using separate icons for &quot;share&quot; vs &quot;send&quot; would make sense to users.<p>I&#x27;m thinking some kind of &quot;upload&quot; metaphor vs &quot;message&quot; metaphor is right.  Messaging metaphors are easy, but upload is a bit more tricky... Apple might have the right idea - but Apple&#x27;s &quot;out of box&quot; icon is too vague, obviously because of Apple&#x27;s need to keep icons elegantly simple.  I&#x27;d go for a bit more complexity:<p>An arrow pointing at a globe.  When you share something, you share with <i>the internet</i>.  MS Office used globes to represent the Web - like a chain+globe for a hyperlink and whatnot.  Use that - an arrow at the globe implies you&#x27;re sending something to the Internet (and generally a public or semi-public place on the Web specifically).",1402538390

The problem is when you want analytics and you want it to scale to 1,000s or 1,000,000s of counters. That may seem ridiculous (who could possibly need that many counters?). But it happens quickly when you say, &quot;How many DAUs do we have? How many from country X? How many using device Y? How many from country X and using device Y?&quot;<p>Also, to address an idea you mentioned around bitmaps. Bitmaps are great until you have lots of counters and lots of users/things to count. Then the problem is they get very sparse. Imagine user #100,000 does something. You need to allocation 97k of space (lots of zeros behind that 100,000th bit) just to count that one thing. Are bitmaps a good idea? Sure, in a lot of cases they are. The problem is they just break down at some point and that&#x27;s when these other tricks are really nice.",1402538342

Ideally falling within the tax-free lower bracket.\nUnlike regular employment, you can start claiming a lot of everyday things such as food/transport/home office electricity/internet/etc. as business expenses, thus meaning you can claim 20% VAT (sales taxes) back depending.<p>Ultimately, there&#x27;s also the final payout if you manage to sell the company.  If it were classed as regular bonus income, you&#x27;d be taxed at 45%.  Instead you get charged as capital gains at 18-28%.  You can also get entrepeneur relief on the first £10m which means you only get charged 10% instead of 28%.<p>NOTE:  Some of these are loopholes like dividends and employing family.  They tend to get cracked down on every now and again (I&#x27;m not even sure if they&#x27;re valid now)<p>But when you get down to it, there are a heck of a lot of potential savings over standard income tax (currently 40% on anything over £32k, 45% over £150k)",1402537317

Those same people are generally forgoing 100-200k jobs.<p>The equity value of a founder&#x27;s shares is an order of magnitude higher than an early hire, or two orders higher than a late A or B round hire, and 3-4 orders higher than a pre IPO employee.  No one gets rich as a regular IC hire at series B or C, even at a Google -- it probably tops out at 10-15mm, vs 15b for the founders.  Even more so at companies less successful than Google.<p>On top of that, founders get supremely preferential tax treatment.  Founders shares are generally bought near nil, and the entirety of gains are long term capital gains.  If you do it right with QSBS and moving to WA before the sale, it can be taxed at zero.  An employee often ends up paying hella AMT on almost all gain from ISOs since he didn&#x27;t early exercise (or, early exercises at substantial out-of-pocket cost), and gets less freedom to sell in later financings, less return in a sub-optimal exit where the sale is covered with preference but &quot;retention grants&quot; are given to founders, etc.<p>I think the optimal strategy is to work for the most prestigious and successful companies purely as a learning and reputation building exercise, and then either be a founder or consultant to make money.  It might be possible to enter a slightly earlier (series b) company as a director or better and still get a reasonable amount of equity (1%+ in a 100-200mm company), but otherwise either going for the tax advantaged, high variance outcome as a founder, or the high cash, flexible, also tax optimized outcome as a consultant, is the best way to actually get paid.",1402537317

Second, they have a very hard time with their processor software (in camera). The first model they put out a few years ago had awful color rendition and strange casts. And not that great performance in low light either. And I mean compared to the models of the era then. At least, IIRC, they smartly removed the antialias filter, or put a very soft one, which gave them a more sharpness, but that was mostly it. Nothing making the camera (M8) worthy being sold for multi-thousand dollars sans lens.<p>What made Leica legendary (back in the day) was their mechanical construction capabilities in the year of analogue cameras this mattered. In the era of digital they cannot compete with a behemoth like Canon making their own sensors, processors and firmware to drive them. Or even Nikon.<p>Of course they still make good lenses. But that&#x27;s just part of the story -- and they are not that better than comparable in price high ends models from other brands.<p>So, no, a &quot;sufficiently skilled photographer&quot; wouldn&#x27;t produce a better picture with the Leica. It&#x27;s an inferior product in every way except mechanical construction (and re-sale value). Plus it&#x27;s a rangefinder -- the precise focus capability of a DSLR is much better.<p>In fact most accomplished photographers today don&#x27;t shoot Leica&#x27;s. They did that back in the day for reporting (like Bresson or Capa). Today they use either some Canon high end (D)SLR or some medium format (if they want to signal &quot;professional&quot;).",1402536628

Writing in 1925, Austin Clark of the Smithsonian Institution offered a typical explanation for the decline. “In the last 20 years,” Clark noted, the size of ships rapidly increased and steam ships replaced sailing vessels. These maritime advances mean that the “vantage point” for observing the sea serpent moved “from the low and insecure wave-washed deck of a small sailing boat to the high, comfortable, secure, and relatively dry deck of a much larger steamer.” This shift in perspective “removed the element of fear and hence dulled the imagination so that sailors are now able to study calmly and report correctly what they see.”<p>Or perhaps the sea serpents were predators, and they depended on one of the species that our bigger and more powerful ships allowed us to hunt more efficiently, and we destroyed enough of their food source that they went extinct.<p>Much of these stories remind me of the stories of giant waves that come out of nowhere and destroy ships. Sailors told stories of these waves for centuries, and their stories were dismissed as exaggerations from drinking or their judgement being thrown off by rough seas (e.g., you think the wave was 75 feet because it was taller than your 75 foot mast...but because of the rough seas you didn&#x27;t realize the mast was actually pointing at a steep angle at the time so the top was only 40 feet above the water).<p>By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scientists thoroughly understood ocean waves, and stated that it was impossible to have waves higher than 50ft in open ocean. No matter how many sailors saw such waves, they were told that they MUST be wrong because science had proved such waves cannot exist.<p>Then sensors on an unmanned platform in the North Sea reported an 84 ft wave during a storm. The operators assumed that this meant that the sensors were malfunctioning, and sent a repair crew. The crew found that the sensors were fine, and there were clear signs of wave damage showing that the wave really was that big.<p>Now that scientists finally had evidence that they could not dismiss as drunken sailors, they went looking for more evidence and quickly found many instances of rogue waves. They found enough to see a pattern, and were able to figure out some of the conditions that would cause them, and find areas that would have a lot of them. And guess what, those were the areas where sailors had long been reporting ships wiped out by those &quot;impossible&quot; waves.<p>Science is great. It&#x27;s the best thing we&#x27;ve got for finding out the truth about nature. But sometimes science gets arrogant and ignores anecdotal evidence even when it is so widespread that some of it almost certainly is from reliable observers. That&#x27;s what happened with rogue waves, and I would not be at all surprised if that happened with at least some of the &quot;mythical&quot; large sea creatures.",1402535410

That&#x27;s regrettable.<p>Somewhat. As of my last experience with them (which was like a year ago), they will accept abuse complaints for booters. If you can prove to them the site is a booter, by providing documentation on the site itself (not hackforums or anywhere else where it&#x27;s being advertised, which is understandable as it&#x27;s basically hearsay, though a bit difficult) indicating the site offers a DDoS service, they will provide the abuse@ email of the hosting company. They will tell you to have the abuse@ people contact them directly for further details. This is the only action they will take.<p>But my opinion is they should, upon confirming the site is a booter, terminate their service to the site. It would also be nice if they would continue to provide the host details, in addition, so the reporter can contact the actual host and have the site taken down from there as well.<p>> Also, any argument you make about CloudFlare could also be made about Google: I see <a href=""http://quantumbooter.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quantumbooter.net</a> as the second link and <a href=""http://top10booters.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://top10booters.com/</a> as the fifth link at <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=booter+services"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=booter+services</a><p>Very good point, thank you for mentioning.<p>The difference I see is that CloudFlare actively provides a service to them, while Google is merely maintaining a keyword-based search listing for them. That being said, I can see both sides of this one.<p>My views on the legitimacy (rather, lack thereof) of booters: they are a service that serves absolutely no legitimate purpose. The sole purpose is to perform an illegal act against another person. I know a bunch of them are sold on hackforums as &quot;stressers,&quot; i.e. &quot;stress test your own server,&quot; but that also isn&#x27;t a legitimate purpose - I can see no case where one would want to stress test their own services with some UDP or SYN flood over the Internet.

On mobile, icons improve the experience.   \n2. Words in other languages can destroy layouts, meaning customizing style for each language.  For instance, potato in english is pomme de terre(apple of the earth) in Canadian French.  Some other languages I&#x27;ve worked with are much worse.  English can be very terse it turns out.\n3. Drop down menus require more clicks than a toolbar.  Word toolbars without images either read like a sentence and are confusing, or they are well padded and then will take even more space.  \n4. Pictures can be more accessible to many people (if done correctly)  \n5. Our brains react to icon faster than to words.  We actually store words and icons differently as well.\n6.

It&#x27;s a great thing if you can get it.<p>2. Your classmates in school will be smarter and think bigger, which has a significant motivational effect. A larger percentage will go on to have significant achievements. Most of your classmates at an elite school will eventually accomplish nothing, just like a state school.<p>3.

Take two people who receive a 5k bonus, if one expected twice as much they will be pissed off and ungrateful. If one expected nothing, they would probably be very happy.<p>This is why it is so important for companies and hiring managers to set appropriate expectations for their employees. Please do not tell people that they can expect career growth, regular challenges, and tons of opportunity if that is not the case.<p>People will absolutely take decent jobs with no opportunities or career growth, but you have to be honest about that. If you lie and the employee realizes it a year later, they will probably start underperforming and/or looking to leave. Appropriate expectations are paramount!",1454397242

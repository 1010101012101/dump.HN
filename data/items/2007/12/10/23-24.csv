So no matter how much you augment that you still deal with text (unless you propose a completely pictorial system which he doesn't appear to do). So in essence you still use, at the base, a text-editor.<p>He calls Emacs a glorified text-editor - and he's right, but the glorified part, or the extensible part, is exactly what he should look at. SLIME mode makes a good start, but one could do much more if they were motivated like one may expect he is. <p>I also fail to understand: ""...so terrible that you have to re-write it. Because basically, you didn't iterate your design."" If he's arguing that we should always rethink our design after a while and not continue on regardless I agree.  But I'm not completely sure what he's getting at. Thoughts?",1197331122

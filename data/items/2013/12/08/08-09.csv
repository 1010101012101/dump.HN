For example, instead of having to click on the query tool, then clicking on the user, then clicking on the link to their profile, you could just click on their profile picture and get a little box showing their top stats. Minor quibble though, great work!",1386492994
6869318,comment,6867607,6867607,1,0,rpedela,,,"&quot;my CS program was woefully inadequate--the standard Java/C++ stuff&quot;<p>That is the foundation for everything else. You will write much better Python if you are competent with C/C++. The truth is that the major languages are very similar. Yes one manages memory, one does not. One supports the ++ operator, one does not. And so on, but at a fundamental level they are essentially the same. The reason why C/C++ and Java are taught is because these languages are good for teaching the fundamentals: how memory works, data structures, functional vs object-oriented, etc.<p>Like others have recommended, an internship is a great way to get real-world experience. This is exactly what I did, and it helped me immensely. In particular, I worked for Delphi-Delco Electronics who make electronic automotive parts. My job was to automate testing of the automobile&#x27;s main computer. Due to safety and regulations, testing was very rigorous so I had to learn how to be rigorous. That skill has helped me immensely throughout my career.<p>BUT that internship was no replacement for my degree. Without the degree I would be good at testing, but it would be quite hard for me to build an efficient web server because I wouldn&#x27;t really understand how the CPU, RAM, etc work. While it is possible to learn all the fundamentals on your own, it requires immense discipline which most of us (myself included) do not possess.<p>That is my two cents. I wish you the best whatever you decide!",1386492960

Humans have been tapping into stored carbon equivalent to a few hundred million years of fossil deposits, and ... that&#x27;s going to have some really long-lived effects.

6869287,comment,6869033,6869033,3,0,javajosh,,,"I dislike this kind of news coverage very much. It is designed to tease rather than inform. Although, I have to admit I was intrigued less by the <i>claim</i> that the game procedurally generates every atom, and more by the <i>question</i> it begs of how you&#x27;d actually generate every atom.<p>Usually, of course, atoms don&#x27;t matter. The ideal gas law, for example, is essentially a &quot;rule of thumb&quot; which gives you useful ways to predict the behavior of large ensembles of atoms; e.g. to average over the movements of statistically significant (avagadro&#x27;s number or so) individual particles - indeed, one of the most amazing things in physics is the connection between Newtonian physics and thermodynamics via statistical mechanics.<p>In any event, my naive answer to the question of what should we simulate would be &quot;don&#x27;t simulate anything you don&#x27;t have to&quot; which means that unless you have scanning electron microscopes <i>in the game</i> you don&#x27;t simulate atoms at all. You mostly use approximations. In games, collisions are important so surfaces (and their properties) tend to be important. And so those simple geometries defines the data structure you use to define the world. In essence mass is <i>defined</i> in a computer program to be a volume that behaves a certain way in the presence of acceleration. But there is no need to describe materials as a lattice of much smaller particles. It&#x27;s almost never relevant to the simulation.<p>So, yeah, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect a game to simulate a world such that ad hoc chemical reactions can take place, etc. But it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect in-game scanning electron microscopes to be able to realistically resolve the details of any material.",1386491364

9906310,comment,9903935,9903935,0,0,Sephr,,,"I agree that supercookies and header enrichment should be prevented whenever and however possible (e.g. header enrichment will be solved by requiring encryption à la Let&#x27;s Encrypt), but fingerprinting is a lost battle that we should all give up on.<p>We will never be able to solve fingerprinting without upheaving the entire web platform as we know it. So many web APIs are simply not possible without exposing some UA capability and configuration variance. For example, it is impossible to support WebGL without exposing additional UA variance for fingerprinting.<p>Computers will always have varying capabilities and configurations, and developers will always need to consider some of them. A world without fingerprinting is a world without the modern web.<p>It only takes ~30 bits of entropy to uniquely fingerprint <i>all ~3 billion internet users</i>. We already expose this much variance entropy, and it is only going to increase as the web gets new features.<p>I implore you all to simply <i>give up</i> on fighting fingerprinting. Try to stop worrying about it, as there&#x27;s almost nothing we can do short of the nuclear option of removing every API that exposes UA variance (which will make the web less useful).<p>We have already lost, and every new feature makes the hole a little deeper. The hole is already too steep to escape, so accept that you will be tracked by colluding websites whenever you browse the web.<p>---<p>The W3C page comes to roughly the same conclusion, but recommends a very drastic and dangerous solution: legislation. I fear that legislating this issue will legitimize only select pre-approved uses of UA variance entropy, and will hinder developer innovation in the long run. I&#x27;d rather be fingerprinted than be held back by legislation as to what browser data I&#x27;m allowed to read, and in what manner I can act on that data.<p>Please do not lobby for legislation in order to fix this problem. W3C&#x27;s proposed solution will most likely only cause more harm than good. I would be deeply upset if &quot;intent to fingerprint&quot; became an actual crime.<p>One example of something useful that such legislation may make illegal is my navigator.hardwareConcurrency polyfill[1] that runs a timing attack on your CPU (not unlike &quot;The Spy in the Sandbox&quot; linked to in the W3C page) to figure out how many cores you have. This information is actually useful for optimizing heavy multi-threaded webapps, but it is also directly useful for fingerprinting. Future legislation could make it so that using my polyfill, even for benign purposes, counts as &quot;intent to fingerprint&quot;.<p>People do not deserve jail time or fines based on if a tech illiterate jury judges you to harbor &quot;intent to fingerprint&quot;. The future will be a very scary place for developers if you actually have to worry about this.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://wg.oftn.org/projects/core-estimator/demo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wg.oftn.org/projects/core-estimator/demo/</a>",1437184626
9906309,comment,9901515,9901618,0,0,gregpilling,,,"For all those who have not liked my post: I rebuilt my first carb about 40 years ago, sitting on my fathers lap (age 5). He was a mechanic, I was a mechanic until I was 20. After that I spent the next 10 years selling tools and diagnostic equipment, as well as fixing a lot of cars - especially problem cars.<p>I have worked on thousands of carburetors. I can re-jet the 2 carbs in my race bike in about 5 minutes (main jets only). Carburetors are indeed in use on millions of engines. I understand Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, and I also understand that a carburetor is lousy at part throttle metering. What does that mean to you?<p>Part throttle is anything that is not full throttle. Some people have a hard time believing that a fuel injected engine offers no full throttle advantage in total horsepower - it is the barely open part that matters. Fuel injection is massively more efficient and clean than carbs at part throttle. The part throttle issues cause all the emissions problems, cause all the pollution, cause all the smell when following behind a carb&#x27;d car.<p>The electronic carbs of the 80&#x27;s were a real nightmare. Take a mechanical device, put some dozen vacuum lines on it, each controlled by a solenoid, give it a dumb computer that you can&#x27;t talk to, and no tech information anywhere. Not even at the dealer. Caveman tech, dressed up with bunch of patches and cruft. It was done to save a buck, not because the better way wasn&#x27;t known. And the systems are horrible and should be sent to the crusher. It is fuel metering in the worst way; adding miles and wear just makes all the problems even worse,<p>The EEC-IV systems used by Ford from 87-95 only had a 60 pin connector on them, the same number of pins that a Beagle Bone Black has. I have be thinking about how to use that as a basis to replace existing systems with an open source system that would be better and cheaper.<p>But carburetors need to die. They are not great new, and get worse with age.",1437184620

They said that once one wall falls, it creates a domino effect. [...] Shortly after publication of the Kansas City Star article, the technical committee of the Tilt-Up Concrete Association (TCA) formed a task force to investigate the claims presented in the article. With the cooperation of Home Depot, the task group performed detailed engineering calculations, research and investigation of the claims posed in the article. [...] The final report was published on January 12, 2012.[22]</i>&quot;<p>Unfortunately, the Wikipedia article doesn&#x27;t say what the final report says. Fortunately, reference 22 has a link[2], and the report&#x27;s executive summary has:<p>&quot;<i>The Task Force’s findings to date include:</i><p>&quot;<i>1. The failure started in the structural steel, steel joist and wide-rib deck roof system.  This roof system is one of the most commonly used systems in commercial 
buildings, including those with masonry walls, precast concrete walls, and almost all 
forms of wall construction</i><p>&quot;<i>2.
The Tilt-Up concrete panels performed very well and survived the extreme loads 
of the EF-5 event only to collapse after the roof failed due to lack of bracing 
mechanism. </i><p>&quot;<i>3.
Tilt-Up construction methods played no role in the failure.</i><p>&quot;<i>4.
The perception that the nearby Wal-Mart store performed better because it was 
concrete masonry is false.  The Wal-Mart took a glancing blow from the storm and 
the Home Depot took a direct hit.</i>&quot;<p>In other words, the roof of a large, open building is the weak link.<p>On the other hand, as a professional programmer, I wonder how well typical commercial software development effort would perform under similar scrutiny.

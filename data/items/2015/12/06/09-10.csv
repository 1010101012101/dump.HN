Incidentally, the economic system is set up in a way to obscure this basic fact. Example:<p>Say a TV is priced at $100, the raw materials to produce the TV costed $24, and all of the depreciated tools in building the TV costed $1 (the tools wear down, eventually requiring replacement). The labor performed by the worker produced $75 of market value.<p>If the capitalist pays the worker the fair $75, the capitalist makes nothing off of this whole coordination. Why in the world would the capitalist do that? Not only can the capitalist not take some of the money for themselves, they don&#x27;t have any money to expand their business. A company that doesn&#x27;t expand is a company that is eaten alive by companies that do expand.

This is similar to the sort of complains the author has about older research into stereotypes assuming they were inaccurate without testing them - no doubt they made that assumption to protect themselves from allegations of racism/sexism/etc.<p>The self-fulfilling prophecy argument is a way to say &quot;OK, they might be true, but the blame lies with some other group of oppressors and it&#x27;s still not an innate quality of the subjects themselves, so it&#x27;s still not really fundamentally true.&quot;. Why shouldn&#x27;t it be an innate quality? Maybe women really do earn less than men because of something different in how men and women earn money, not because men oppress women with their stereotypes.<p>Without research, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more reasonable to say &quot;stereotypes are mainly accurate because they&#x27;re self-fulfilling prophecies&quot; than to say &quot;stereotypes are mainly accurate because groups of people are naturally different.&quot;.",1449394927

The car mechanic doesn&#x27;t create anything new. Let&#x27;s take the construction worker, then. This is really bad analogy but hold on.<p>The construction worker gets plans, builds the house, and moves on. Architecture, engineering and construction are split to separate people, all of whom have a known cost to their labour. Thus, we have a fixed project and a more or less transparent cost structure.<p>Software <i>is nothing like building a house</i> except in rare circumstances. Real world construction projects are mostly about creating linear combinations of known things.<p>Writing new software is like playing a combined game of sudoku and mastermind in a dark room - in the best circumstances. Sometimes the lights are on and the board is almost done, and you only need to put one piece down.<p>But - you can&#x27;t really tell from outside what the situation is. Is the board ready? Did someone mess up the first steps and now they have to start over?<p>The whole thing is like a black box with input and output. The only measure of quality and value is that <i>is the customer satisfied with the data coming out</i>. There is no metric you can gauge the work reliably.<p>From the point of view of the organization the software project is like a black box, into which the team goes to do their work. They yell estimates to the project manager sitting patiently outside, who then writes project reports. After the team declares they are done, the deliverable can be tested.<p>You can send anyone inside the room, but only software engineers understand whats going on.<p>Sometimes a new programmer needs to meditate months inside the room before starting doing changes.<p>Sometimes the black box blows up.<p>Sometimes the team just goes into the box and cries all day without doing any porgress-for months - unknown to the org.<p>I&#x27;m sure this gets the imagination going - basically, anything that can happen with a black puzzle box and real people can happen.<p>I&#x27;m exaggerating to make a point, of course. But these unknowables make writing software a really risky proposition from the point of the view of the org. And individual can be incredibly productive, or a total failure, and it&#x27;s really hard to point this out reliably if all are not specialists.<p>That&#x27;s why, IMO, personal bonuses aren&#x27;t really helpfull for software projects and fixed company wide bonuses are the only way reward without creating unfair situations. Any KPI based individual bonus system will at worst be destructive, and at best almost completely unfair.",1449394332

10684787,comment,10682378,10682378,0,0,CurtMonash,,,"I think this is a fair critique, if a bit hyperbolic.<p>One point overlooked is that the predominant form of science fiction was, for some decades, short stories. Salvor Hardin was as richly imagined a character as Bayta Darell, but he only appeared in short stories (or novellas); he was the hero for about half of Foundation. The sequels were novels; the women were accordingly more memorable; and by the way, I found grandaughter more memorable than grandmother anyway.<p>Another point overlooked is the happy introduction of the vivid, lovable rogue. Nicholas van Rijn is an excellent example, even if by profession he is a tycoon. Lazarus Long is another; I found him a lot more vivid than the article&#x27;s author evidently did. Fafryd and the Grey Mouser are Exhibits 3A and 3B, although that&#x27;s fantasy, and even Lord of the Rings had vivid characters, so perhaps the criticism never applied to fantasy at all.<p>On the other hand -- as much as I adore Zelazny, his heroes are pretty much all the same. They&#x27;re jaded and cynical, witty in their cynicism, and usually very altruistic even so. Usually they&#x27;re quasi-immortal demigods too, with the most important counterexample that part probably being the poet in A Rose For Ecclesiastes.<p>Dune deserves a mention as being fairly early in the genre for having great characterization. Also Ann McCaffrey&#x27;s Pern books, but those are really fantasies with a thin SF veneer.<p>Getting more modern yet, I agree that characterization is the norm rather than the exception. My favorite is probably Miles Vorkosigan. I have no idea how that series could win so many Hugos and Nebulas and still seem to be relatively unknown.",1449394026

That is why it was RULED OUT OF ORDER.<p>Specifically:<p>Here&#x27;s the proposed language it is looking to overlay:\n<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8245-2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/sen...</a>\n(the Obamacare component repeal)<p>Now, here&#x27;s the Feinstein amendment (scroll down to &quot;SA 2910&quot; portion, read it only):\n<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/senate-amendment/2910/text"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/senate-ame...</a><p>Now, if you look at the amendment in a vacuum, it looks sorta like what it claims (but it looks odd, to the experienced eye, because there is no mention of a specific criteria for &quot;terrorist&quot; or refer to the FBI watchlist by its proper statute name).

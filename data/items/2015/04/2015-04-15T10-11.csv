9380059,comment,9378852,9379850,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> finding it in a context where you can determine the date and place it was dropped and who might have owned it is valuable information that doesn&#x27;t usually follow black market artefacts around (because it&#x27;s proof of a crime)<p>Is it? I&#x27;d guess that that sort of information doesn&#x27;t follow black market artifacts around because the black market is just generally shady. I&#x27;d expect that any evidence of crime would quickly wash out, for the following reason:<p>I recall reading a post on Language Log (here: <a href=""http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4120"" rel=""nofollow"">http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4120</a> ) about finding a cuneiform tablet at an &quot;estate sale&quot; in Seattle. The author brought it to an expert on the ancient near east and was surprised to have it confirmed as genuine.<p>There were indignant comments on the post, to the effect that obviously nobody in the US could <i>legitimately</i> own a cuneiform tablet from ancient Mesopotamia. So why wasn&#x27;t this guy violating the law? And the very sensible answer was that a law prohibiting the ownership of old objects would mainly have the effect that people fearing discovery would destroy their antiquities, simultaneously removing all evidence of any putative crime and preventing anyone from ever learning anything from what used to be a (semi-)valuable artifact.<p>It&#x27;s harder to destroy a metal coin than a block of clay, but most artifacts, like bones, statues, and inscriptions, don&#x27;t pose such difficulties. Is it really illegal to own an old coin while not being illegal to own an old document?<p>edit: rereading the comments, it seems that owning these old things frequently is illegal, although interestingly owning the same item might or might not be illegal depending on the details of how you obtained it (<i>not</i> the details of where it came from). But I&#x27;ll leave my comment up because I think the ideas expressed have some merit, although they don&#x27;t entirely source to the comment thread that I &quot;remembered&quot; them from, and are a little more hypothetical and less factual than I originally thought.",1429095446

While it is certainly good that this study does not show an anti-female bias (not saying the 2:1 preference is necessarily good), I&#x27;m seeing this hailed as &#x27;proof sexism doesn&#x27;t exist,&#x27; which it is not. Several studies, the most notable one being from 2012 (Moss-Racusin is the author iirc), found that at the undergraduate level, men are preferred and given a high salary. If both of these studies are true, it means that as women age/gain higher degrees/prove themselves, this bias disappears. This makes sense when you think about it, but is still a good thing.<p>2. While I don&#x27;t like this bias against men, I don&#x27;t think men need to worry about it yet. Probably, the only reason the preference is so high is because so few women apply for these positions. Were an equal number of men and women applying for the position, it&#x27;d likely be a different story.<p>3. No one against the broad goal of &#x27;sexism in tech&#x27; that I&#x27;ve heard at least is vying for  50-50 representation. If 70% of engineers are men, fine. The problem is that many girls who would become engineers are never exposed to it or are pushed away (some by the attitude that &#x27;women just naturally don&#x27;t like STEM&#x27;—read &#x27;Unlocking the Clubhouse.&#x27;) Much of the barriers to women in STEM come from childhood (women being less likely to take STEM classes due to low confidence in math etc)—it&#x27;s good to see women don&#x27;t need to worry about bias in academia, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But I see strawmen here. As a woman in tech who got a late start because &quot;math is hard for girls,&quot; and who had a programmer cousin who admitted to me that he never showed it to me because he assumed girls didn&#x27;t like it, despite knowing I enjoyed math/physics—I&#x27;m not trying to build a &#x27;fempire&#x27; in which women are preferred to men and the 1950s repeat themselves in reverse.

Nim very much encourages TIMTOWTDI over Python&#x27;s there-should-be-preferably-one-way-to-do-it. Nim also has extremely flexible syntax where Python is rigid. See Nim&#x27;s pervasive use of metaprogramming via macros, or its inclusion of user-defined symbolic operators (as per Haskell and Scala), or the fact that it considers `foo` and `Foo` and `FOO` and `f_O__o` to be equivalent identifiers, or its inclusion of UFCS.<p>Nim is a neat language, but comparisons to Python solely because it has semantic indentation are completely shallow (especially so when you consider that Guido doesn&#x27;t even think that whitespace sensitivity is an important feature).",1429092448

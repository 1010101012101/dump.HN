One of the biggest is that in Chess, you can more easily evaluate intermediary positions by material advantage. Positioning still matters, and there's plenty of times where a sacrifice is worth it, but material advantage is a serviceable enough quantitative measure. Go does not see captures as commonly, and emphasizes positioning more, which makes it harder to quantify.<p>The other problem is that (if I remember right) Go has more possibilities, so it's harder to look ahead as far. All grid intersections on the board are possible moves, and the board is bigger, while for chess the range of moves is more constrained. But really, this isn't the important part, because the forecast horizon of both games are finite, which means in both games at some point you have to stop looking at possibilities and evaluate board position of leaf nodes.

It's not quite the same as the silent film era stars who couldn't make it in talkies but I don't think it's entirely different either. It's just a different skill set and a big transition to make for someone who's been doing basically the same exact show every night for 15 years.",1263873754

If you discover ""empirical evidence"" that a theorem is wrong, you must either propose a change in the axioms or find a flaw in the proof. Contemporary economists often appear to do neither.""<p>That's not how the real sciences work, though--physics doesn't operate through axioms and theorems, it establishes a few <i>theories</i> and as long as they hold within experimental error, they don't complain too much. When they stop holding, we either postulate extra ""stuff"" we don't directly observe (most of the outlying planets as well as the Kuiper belt were discovered by measuring their gravitational effects on planets we could directly observe) or use a more refined theory on the edge cases (Mercury's orbit). But all the while physics gathers more and more empirical data, and spends a lot of time trying to make sense of it.<p>""When I read the Austrian argument that any fixed amount of money-stuff (e.g., gold) is sufficient for exchange, I understand the axioms, follows the steps, and accept the conclusion. When I read the Keynesian arguments for the benefits of monetary expansion and ""fiscal stimulus"", I see---great clouds of fog.""<p>The other problem I find is that most armchair Austrians take their entire economic understanding from an 80 year old dispute and have no conception of what's happened in the field ever since. Keynes is a dead old man and the field of economics has moved on from his work.<p>Incidentally, even if you just take the approach of pure reason, it's still pretty fucking easy to debunk the idea of the gold standard.<p>""Apparently, these restaurant managers are too stupid to realize they're allowed to pay above the current minimum wage, thereby getting those lazy teens off their couches to fill the vacancies without a minimum wage hike. Truly, it boggles the mind.)""<p>And here you see one of the biggest problems with the field of economics in general, a problem that's only been tackled in recent decades--modeling how <i>actual human beings behave in the real world</i> rather than supposing that each economic actor is fully informed, perfectly rational, and perfectly self-interested. How many 16 year old kids would know whether or not Burger King paid above minimum wage? Of course Burger King only pays minimum wage. It's a cultural expectation. The same thinking applies to the manager--is a fast food manager really going to be fully informed, perfectly rational, and perfectly self-interested? For the most part, his job consists of executing a manual written at the corporate headquarters in a different state which dictates that crew are paid local minimum wage, and quite frankly, the corporate overhead of rewriting the corporate manual to allow wage adjustments to recruit people to work at a fucking Jack in the Box isn't justified.",1263873725

Apple loves control and there’s no way that they can have total control over Mac software sales since the current distribution and sales methods are in place and well established.</i><p>Apple could release new SDKs for other kinds of machines, which require software distribution through an App Store.  This would give them control over such a market.<p>I think this may well happen.  The ""Apple Tablet"" would be a great platform to get this started.  Having such a walled garden would seem great from the non computer-savvy end user's point of view.  The user pays an ""Apple Tax"" and the government polices everything and keeps things clean and safe.  As it was and still is (not as much) in the freewheeling ""wild west"" of the online world, if one doesn't have certain skills, one is a second-class citizen at the mercy of the more skilled individuals.  In such a walled garden world, the ""law abiding taxpayer"" would be the one catered to, and those special skilled individuals become the outlaws.  (Or become civil servants and use their skills at the behest of the government.)<p>For better or for worse, I think that this is actually what a lot of the less sophisticated computer users want!

Apple also led with the mouse and with various screen technologies. Haptics aren't brand new any more than multitouch was; it does seem plausible they might do something with haptic stuff, and it would seem to explain that teaser.<p>The main things that we've seen on other platforms which Apple might conceivably copy are wireless charging systems (like WebOS had) or handling NFC payments (like a few Android phones had)",1330491549

If yes, would that hurt? (or, another case is if you had encountered a bug in your code that mistakenly recorded the wrong data thus you have to ""clean them all"").<p>3) I saw your code regarding code optimization, would that cause the code to become a bit brittle by not encapsulating the caching somehow?

To put it more succinctly, everyone wants to be the\nauthority in control.<p>In other words, many authorities are anti-authoritarians. Their refusals\nto cede control is their method to gain and retain control. Similarly,\nthose who abide by existing authorities are merely employing a more\ndeceptive method to gain and retain control.

Removing the home button removes part of the easy transition from one device to the other. If an iPhone owner is thinking of buying a home-button-less iPad, they'll launch an app, and then stare in confusion trying to figure out how to leave it again. Eventually someone will come and explain to them that if you pinch your fingers this certain way, it will take you back to the home screen. And the experience is lessened.<p>I love the system Apple is building. The gestures built into iOS 5 make it faster and easier for me to use everyday. But gestures are like keyboard shortcuts - they require instruction and they're not discoverable. I think having a so-called ""Panic"" button exist on the device is important for the way it functions for consumers (not to mention integral to Siri's interface if that makes its way to the iPad). Will it be a physical button? Maybe, maybe not.

If what you're doing fits the Rails pattern, that's probably a better solution than anything in node.

The rotor itself is composed of a number of alpha-helices that have a single location for a motile hydrogen to attach. In doing so, it causes a rotation of the lower half of the helix, generating a mechanical motion that turns the rotor.<p>In fact, probably the most amazing aspect of this protein is that it is, in every sense of the term, a nano-machine. ATP is generated not by chemical reaction, but rather by mechanical force. The 3 active sites in the F1 unit have residues which hold the ADP and Pi in a favorable arrangement, but it is the spring action, triggered by the crankshaft, that causes a vice-like movement that literally squeezes the two together to form ATP.<p>Very cool...if you ask me.",1330488648

You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode's office and said, ``How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?'' He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, ``You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.'' I simply slunk out of the office!<p>What Bode was saying was this: ``Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.'' Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don't want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode's remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done. I don't like to say it in front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done. There's no question about this. </i><p>And trust me this incremental learning and productivity give mindblowing results over time.",1330488543

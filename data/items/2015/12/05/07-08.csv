For lossy compression, there are lots of unexplored areas.<p>I still like the FrameFree approach to video compression. Motion estimation decomposes sequences of images into a set of layers which move and morph, much like the way 2D movies are converted to pseudo-3D.  This is hard, but can be done, and there are several software packages for it, of varying quality.  Decompression is done by morphing each layer between keyframes, warping a texture-mapped mesh in a GPU.  Decompression can be done to any frame rate, including ones much higher than the original.  This approach is often used to generate ultra-slow motion.<p>(FrameFree was demonstrated around 2006, but the company behind it, Kerner Optical, went bust for unrelated reasons.)",1449302343

If you just figure out the 256-bit key, it would compress well with any compressor - there&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> class of files which would only need 256 additional bits! Why isn&#x27;t there any advance on this front? /s<p>Entropy is not a broken measurement - in fact, it&#x27;s the perfect measurement (proof: Shannon&#x27;s source coding theorem and its converse), its only downside is that it is only defined with respect to a model.<p>If you measure it on the output of one model (permutations) with respect to another model (i.i.d) then, duh, it&#x27;s wrong. And general permutations are so rare, that they might bug the author but there&#x27;s no incentive to consider them. Non general permutations - e.g., addition-modulo permutations, often ARE reasonably well compressed by markov/tree/fsmx model algorithms and their delta counterparts. (And they&#x27;re still too rare to consider on their own).<p>Kolmogorov complexity is interesting, but it is too vast and complicated to consider as a whole (proof: equivalence of computing Chaitin&#x27;s omega to the halting problem), other than as a very useful reasoning device.

At this stage -- the point where you&#x27;ve identified a noticeable spike in arrests on early Wednesday&#x27;s evenings -- it&#x27;s worth trying to ask the SFPD why this discrepancy exists -- if it&#x27;s something related to the reality of arrests (such as drug bust patrols stepping up on early evenings) or even what the Date/Time field represents -- is it the time of the initial report, or when the booking has been made? I&#x27;ve looked at the SFPD data on various occasions and have never been able to figure it out (based on looking at the data alone) and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it varied depending on the crime and disposition.<p>One thing I noticed on a recent inspection (actually, one of my students pointed out) was that the arrest rate is lower in 2015 for certain categories of crime, compared to 2014...and one possible reason for that discrepancy is because the dataset is updated as the disposition of the incident changes...i.e. when an arrest is finally made, a month(s) later, then the record is updated in the dataset.<p>The SF crime data is certainly granular and lends itself to analysis (certainly more than what&#x27;s released by the NYPD)...but it lacks the specificity that can be found in Chicago and Dallas crimesets, which, IIRC, have separate fields for recording the time of the report and the time of last update to that report, among many other fields (though all the various departments have their own flaws and inconsistencies).",1449300350

For most users, the bottleneck is the network and a JSON payload is typically a lot smaller than a fully rendered HTML page. This reduces the overhead (unless your users have crap CPUs and fast network connections - not the norm).<p>- Better separation of concerns. Your server becomes a dumb API and doesn&#x27;t need to concern itself with presentation. Your UI can live in an entirely different repository and it doesn&#x27;t matter which framework or language your backend is written in. Front-end developers only need to know about browser technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) to build the UI. This reduces complexity instead of &quot;needlessly&quot; increasing it.<p>- Thanks to server side Javascript, it&#x27;s relatively easy to have a fallback mechanism in place to do traditional server side rendering for web crawlers or browsers with Javascript disabled.",1449299912

ISPs were no longer incentivized to use deep-packet-inspection to interrupt or throttle connections. Regulations required incumbents to grant access to last-mile networks to smaller ISPs to encourage competition. Users had more choice -- plans differentiated on both speed and on bandwidth caps, so if you needed a small amount of data in a month but you needed it quickly, you could still save money by picking the right plan. ISPs were encouraged to build out their networks more, since increased speed led to increased usage led to more recurring income: if you wanted the fastest speeds now and could pay $200/month for it, you got it; if you didn&#x27;t, you could get Internet faster than the average American &quot;high speed&quot; connection for something like $30/month.",1449299902

See if other companies are willing to make you a decent offer. It may take a fair bit of time to find a company that really wants you, that you&#x27;d be willing to work for, and will make you a strong offer. You are in a good position to look for other options when you are not rushed and are not desperate - i.e. - when you are already employed. Once you have one or more offers on the table, then you are in an excellent position to either take the offer, or begin negotiating with your current employer for a raise to a level that is competitive with the offer.<p>If you go to your employer and say &quot;give me a 20% raise&quot; - or even &quot;give me a 20% raise because <reasons why you are valuable>&quot; without having first cultivated a strong alternative option, and they refuse, what are you going to do?

The pragmatic way to implement this in a real compiler is to add some logic to the lexer so that it&#x27;s working with more information than just the syntax. Theoretically though, all that really matters is that both possibilities are syntactically valid.

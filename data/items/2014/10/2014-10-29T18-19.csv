Web Designer for responsive web page, 2. Industrial Designer (Printer Design) 3. 3D Graphics for video 4. Audio Editor for video 5. Audio Talent for video, 6. Copy editor for corporate speak (probably one for video and one for webpage) 7. Legal department for footnotes. This is all before a single product can be purchased. Compare this to an MVP where there is a video demonstration of the product and how you fit with it.<p>* Video does not show a single printing machine doing just an imagination of what can be, suggesting this is a corporate video for shareholders instead of users.<p>* The product is not available for purchase and there is no time line to expect purchase. There are a number of 3d printers available to purchase right now, no need to wait for this printer to come out.<p>* From the paper and soggypenny&#x27;s quote: &quot;shortcomings of the STL format...&quot; is a great reason to introduce an AutoCad / Microstation / Sketchup plugin software to easily render for a 3-D format.<p>* Call to action &quot;Connect with Us&quot; takes you to a multi-line e-mail form for their internal databases. Compare this with an MVP that just wants your e-mail and your name.<p>HP, great step forward in your effort to try and recover from potential insolvency. Please look at your competition before getting my hopes up and dashed in one web page.",1414609183

8529135,comment,8527932,8528991,0,0,meepmorp,,,">  This is an instant fail company.<p>This is a project largely driven by Walmart with some buy in from other merchants. Walmart has recently announced it&#x27;ll provide low cost checking accounts to its customers[1]. Walmart&#x27;s profits are basically driven by volume and beating up their vendors for low prices so they can in turn sell to customers at low prices - the margins are razor thin. Cutting out 2-3% from credit card fees has got to look attractive.<p>I&#x27;d never touch this product, because it&#x27;s got shitty implementation and security written all over it, but I&#x27;m not so sure if it&#x27;ll be instant fail or not. If they offer a portion of what they save in credit card fees in flat discounts to people, they might be able to make it work.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t really see what non-Walmart merchants are gonna get out of this. Helping them improve their margins seems like it&#x27;d only make things worse for places like Target or grocery stores.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/business/finding-a-door-into-banking-walmart-to-offer-checking-accounts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/business/finding-a-door-in...</a>",1414609131

8529132,comment,8528460,8528460,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"It&#x27;s hard for me to grok this project&#x27;s design goals. I mean, the basic idea is simple enough to understand: I want to run SQL queries on metadata about my hosts. I&#x27;ve built and run several different iterations of that same idea, but they didn&#x27;t require thousands of lines of C++.<p>The usual implementation is simple: take any host monitor (say, collectd) that can export key/value pairs from a host, or take a log stream over the network and pair it with a host monitor/log scraper to create key/value pairs. Then insert into an SQL engine while appending to a log for a historical record (or PTA/PITR/whatever, i&#x27;m not a DBA). Separately you can create a database application to query/modify the database as needed.<p>But we&#x27;re talking like, a handful of python scripts that don&#x27;t ever change except to add new search features. This seems like a big departure from the simplicity of that approach. Am I missing something?",1414609094

8529096,comment,8522032,8525393,0,0,mindcrime,,,"<i>The world doesn&#x27;t owe you property rights either.</i><p>Never said it did.  I don&#x27;t think the world <i>owes</i> anybody anything.  The question is, when is using force / violence justified. My position is that initiation of force / aggression are not justified, but force can be used in self-defense.<p><i>It takes force and coersion to enforce whatever guarantees and protections you feel you are entitled to under &quot;your&quot; system of property.</i><p>Defensive force though.  I&#x27;m against using force to compel people to participate in a system, or do things, against their will.<p><i>And if you claim it does, why can&#x27;t I claim that the government should also, say, help ensure my right to life through emergency medical care in a hospital?</i><p>IF your structure (whether you call it &quot;government&quot; or something else) can accomplish that end without using initiation of force, there is no reason at all why they shouldn&#x27;t do that.  BUT, and here&#x27;s the problem... in practice, &quot;government&quot; as we know it is pretty much always predicated on using violence to achieve its ends.  Taxes are collected at the end of a gun barrel, and people aren&#x27;t given an option to &quot;opt out&quot; in any realistic sense.<p><i>After all it&#x27;s a really barbaric society by 21st century standards that lets a man die if it means that no other man doesn&#x27;t have to give up 2% of his fiat currency.</i><p>Sure, no argument against that.  But I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s an equally barbaric society - or more so - where we institutionalize the initiation of violence to achieve our ends, no matter how noble they sound.<p><i>In short there&#x27;s nothing magical about states or property rights. If you had other organizatonal structures they&#x27;d still have to enFORCE their policies / laws and still have a management team / government. Corporations, co-ops, neighborhoods etc all have these things. They all have to be run somehow and enforce the policies.</i><p>The difference between a State and other structures is that States (in practice) aren&#x27;t limited to voluntary association, and they claim for themselves the &quot;right&quot; to use force in a non defensive mode.  Build a State that is strictly limited to acting as the collective extension to our individual right to self-defense, and I&#x27;d probably be onboard.<p><i>Finally the govt can just print fiat money to pay for this which doesnt &quot;force&quot; anyone.</i><p>Except, by and large, we&#x27;ve seen States refuse to allow anybody else to compete with their currency.  If you try, they send men with guns to come and round you up and take you to jail.  It will be interesting to see what happens with Bitcoin in this regard, since it is so decentralized.",1414608728

Two big things to point out:<p>Firstly, security: &quot;Further cryptanalytic review is recommended before this cipher is used in critical applications.&quot; I echo that. Have fun cryptanalysing it by all means, but please don&#x27;t <i>use</i> it. Many already have deep concerns about RC4, and I know I wouldn&#x27;t feel too comfortable with anything particularly RC4-like, because it&#x27;s not clear to me yet how pending public results on RC4, or unpublished &quot;cryptanalytic breakthroughs&quot; from Nation State Adversaries (cough) may or may not read on ciphers with a closely similar design. Doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence.<p>Secondly, speed. Sᴘʀɪᴛᴢ is <i>not</i> winning any speed contests; in fact, it&#x27;s pretty much coming in dead last. Looking at cycles/byte (lower is better), in generating sustained keystreams, which is the kindest I can be to it, Sᴘʀɪᴛᴢ clunks along at 24 cycles/byte on their Macbook Air&#x27;s Core i5, which I think is an Ivy Bridge? For reference, taking the eBACS benchmark results from SUPERCOP, the modern stream cipher CʜᴀCʜᴀ20 runs on an broadly-equivalent processor (h9ivy) at 2.75 cycles/byte—nearly <i>10 times faster</i> than Sᴘʀɪᴛᴢ! <i>Ouch.</i> <a href=""http://bench.cr.yp.to/results-stream.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bench.cr.yp.to/results-stream.html</a> - actually even AES-256, in software, is faster at encryption. From the paper, I also think it&#x27;s slower at hashing than SHA-512 or any of the SHA-3 finalists.<p>While the authors note that theirs isn&#x27;t a particularly optimised implementation right now, I unfortunately don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s too much scope for improvement, because what it shares with RC4 are the characteristics that bottleneck performance - if you&#x27;re code-golfing for minimum code size, fine, but for speed optimisation it shares the same 8-bit-oriented structure with a huge state (bye-bye hardware implementation) and pipeline stalls due to iterative dependencies. This overall design pattern may have made some sense when RC4 was designed, for an 8-bit CPU with no cache, but not so much now - they acknowledge this in the paper and in fact suggest &quot;other word-oriented architectures may be a better choice than the byte-oriented RC4/Spritz style&quot;. I agree.<p>Should you <i>use</i> it, at all? Oh <i>heavens</i>, no. I see nothing to recommend it whatsoever. I do think it&#x27;s kind of cute though. Made me smile.",1414607353

8528813,comment,8527469,8527762,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"If Toronto is anything like many American municipalities, a large chunk of that cost is pensions. Pension funds are often not fully paid up, and payments into the fund are often subject to rosy predictions about future earnings that lead to shortfalls if the fund manager underperforms. Additionally, public pensions often have a large &#x27;defined benefit&#x27; overhang meaning that many beneficiaries are contractually entitled to fixed payouts. Finally, many public pensions are also based on final salary at retirement or in a short (1-3 year) period leading up to retirement, so it&#x27;s common for in the US (and likely elsewhere) for police to work ridiculous amoutns of overtime in their last few years on the force in order to puff up their pension. Since the administration of a pension fund can involve payment obligations that reach back for many decades, the burdens of past financial or contractual mismanagement are often cumulative and ultimately fall upon the taxpayer.<p>This is not as exciting or scarifying as police spending too much money on military toys, but it&#x27;s a much more likely explanation for budgetary increases. One other possible problem which has recently been an issue in San Jose, California is that police academies sometimes spend a lot of money training new officers, only to see them leave immediately after graduation for other cities/counties that offer better pay or benefits. In the US many municipalities run their own police academies and there are no contractual obligations on graduates. San Jose has been strenuously trying to reform its pension system, so (unsurprisingly) new entrants to the force get a much worse deal than senior members whose benefits are locked in and have to be paid for by cuts to the benefits that can be earned by new members. So graduates train up in San Jose and then take off for some other city in the area that&#x27;s offering a sweeter deal, possibly with the encouragement of of the police union that is not enthused about pension reform.",1414606154

8528788,comment,8527469,8527469,0,0,SyncTheory13,,,"I have a story similar to this, though it didn&#x27;t involve the police actually searching my home.<p>In March of 2011, my St. Louis hosted an Occupy convention - which was mostly workshops/lectures and some very tame marches due to out-of-town folks. My roommates and I had been involved for a bit and some had given our address out when arrests were made.<p>This was prime-time for police intimidation (including of witnesses) and undercover agents. We were aggressively tailed by unmarked cars, had police writing down license-plates of those at our house, and had a constant police presence circling the block and down the alley.<p>Aside from very close friends being intensely beaten for participating in a march that was staying on the sidewalk (a scene that still haunts most of us) - the most corrupt thing that happened to us was when they worked with the local Electric company (Ameren UE) to have our electricity shut off.<p>We called the electric company to find out why it was shut off when the bill had been up-to-date and were told they were ordered to by the police due to the house being declared Condemned and us being labeled as squatters.<p>We had some pro-bono lawyers who advised me to threaten the electric company with legal action - which made their representatives quickly make up a legal excuse as to why our electric was shut off. I informed the landlord, who checked into it and found that it involved a Sergeant with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.<p>The conversation between then went something along the lines of:
- Landlord: Why has the house been declared condemned and the electric shut off?
- Police: This house has been involved with Occupy and often serves as a meeting place for it.
- Landlord: Ok... Is it illegal to hold meetings in a house?
- Police: Well... No...
- Landlord: Then we shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.<p>Probably helped that the landlord is a high-ranking official in the nearby Air Force base. Within 24 hours, our electric was reconnected.<p>My take-away from all of this, and the current events, is that the best course of action in dealing with aggressive and usually illegal police activities is to fight back with an even more aggressive legal campaign as well as establishing a very close and open relationship with all surrounding neighbors. Their fraternity acts as an organizational bully that constantly pushes what they can get away with until they sense actual danger to themselves/their jobs in terms of legal ramifications, etc.",1414605876

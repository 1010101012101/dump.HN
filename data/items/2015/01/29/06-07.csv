I suspect this is part of the reason why it&#x27;s more common with commercial real estate.<p>The goal is to avoid tax reassessment when a property is sold, which is a big deal since the average price of a house in CA in 1940 was $36,700 and is now $211,500 (and much, much higher in places like Los Angeles and San Francisco). Even at the average house price, it&#x27;s the difference between a $367/yr bill versus a $2,115/yr bill. Presumably commercial real estate has seen an equivalent rise over time.<p><a href=""http://www.boe.ca.gov/proptaxes/leopexclusions.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boe.ca.gov/proptaxes/leopexclusions.htm</a>",1422514397

That said, many counties, such as the one I live in, run on a shoestring budget and can&#x27;t keep up with the current request load - the overhead for modernization or even corrections doesn&#x27;t seem to exist, and the whole situation is made worse by the standard &quot;pace of government.&quot; There&#x27;s nothing like local politics to delay any kind of large-scale project.<p>The end result is that I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if, nationally, enormous binders are more common than GIS. The property records in my county are in the form of yellowing pages in 20-pound leather post binders on those rolling high-density shelves. People complaining about 2 minute query times? Here you drive to the county clerk&#x27;s office, ask them your question, and they <i>might</i> be able to tell you which of the giant binders to look in first.

8964690,comment,8959126,8964205,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"> most of the countries of the world are not actually at war<p>It&#x27;s sort of hard to reason about this. War has changed significantly in the sense that were there to be an absolute war between Great Powers the collateral damage would be wholely absolute. That doesn&#x27;t mean the Great Powers haven&#x27;t come close to all out armed conflict, or even that they aren&#x27;t currently engaged in proxy measures to increase their spheres of influence.<p>Take the current crisis in Ukraine. American citizens seem  surprised that events are currently unfolding there, as though all of a sudden Russia decided to be a bully, and as if the events in Ukraine unfolded due to activity local to the region. This ignores the context - that NATO and the EU, under the leadership of Germany (who was hacked recently - again - by Russia) with the support of the US has for the past decade pushed hard to absorb former Warsaw Pact nations. It ignores that both Georgia and Moldova before Ukraine were geographically split into breakaway regions and saw West- and Russian- backed separatists, cluster munitions and the rest. It ignores that the West was involved in the funding and training of Euromaiden groups and the Orange Revolution, that Voice of America pushed for political changes in these Baltic states that led to their distancing with Russia. It ignores the conflict between the United States plans to deploy anti-ballistic missile shields in zones technically illegal according to Cold War deals and Russia&#x27;s responses. It ignores the Russian push to expand influence in parts of Europe and its support of Eurosceptic parties. It ignores the contended areas around the world that both Russia and NATO lay claim to (including areas in the North Arctic, which are important strategic military points). It ignores the stop of disarmament, and in fact rearmament and reassessment of nuclear capability, of nuclear countries (primarily Russia and the United States). It ignores the forming of an alternate world bank between China, Russia, India, and Brazil. It ignores the that the conflict in Syria is both historically grounded as an area of Cold Proxy War and Russia&#x27;s support for the Syrian Assad regime today. It ignores Russia&#x27;s ambitions to build stronger ties with the Latin Americas. It ignores the development of hypersonic missile delivery systems by the nuclear proliferated nations (to which there is no known defensive answer, well besides, to small degrees formerly mentioned &#x27;anti-ballistic shields&#x27;... say located in the Czech Republic or Poland...), and the sharing of this technology between allies.<p>This is a long, roundabout way of saying that there is absolutely conflict that errs on the side of violent conflict today and that in fact the areas of most activity  - Ukraine and other Baltic states, Syria, Venezuela - and where tensions are building like North Korea and parts of Europe are areas that are inherently and intrinsically linked to Cold War spheres of influence and the interests of Great Powers today.<p>The nature of war has changed. It has had to. But nations are still at war. If you don&#x27;t want to call it that, we don&#x27;t have to call it that. We can call it state violence or something.<p>The second point to be made here is that <i>most</i> of the capabilities of the intelligence agencies are geopolitical capabilities whose targets are states rather than violent individuals. From the targeting of nationals&#x27; cell phones and email records, the hacking of national oil companies and infrastructure, the sabotage of nuclear operations in Iraq and now South Korea, the exfiltration of defense data from the United States and from Israel, the hacking and grounding of the Syrian air force, the cyber attack on Georgia during military intervention - these capabilities are cybermilitary first and cyberpolice second.",1422513683

The only way to scientifically test a prediction is to do nothing and see if it happens and then publish the result either way, but the probability of the government doing that is zero. The government playbook is obvious: They&#x27;re either going to arrest the person and declare victory even if the prediction would have been wrong, or send in some agitators to provoke the person into committing a crime and then declare victory if they do or pretend it never happened if they don&#x27;t.<p>One way to prove that it isn&#x27;t working is if there are still terrorist attacks or high crime rates despite all the spying, but then they&#x27;ll just want to use the empirical evidence that their spying is ineffective as an excuse to do more spying or some other stupid/invasive/expensive thing. Meanwhile if (as seems to be the trend) crime and terrorism remain at low levels, that proves nothing either way because it could just as easily be a result of something like the elimination of leaded gasoline[1] in most countries outside of the middle east.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-li...</a><p>A possible solution is to require ultimate disclosure of <i>all</i> criminal investigations.

I was in high school so I had no bills, no kids, and lots of spare time. My grandparents bought a terminal and dial-up modem for me so I had access to timesharing systems from my room. I had two mentors available who both worked as programmers. I read every book I could find, read and wrote code every day for three years, learned every language I could find a compiler or interpreter for. When I eventually got a job as a programmer I was a junior making decent but not great money. I still had a lot to learn at that time.<p>Programming was much simpler back then. The languages and tools were an order of magnitude (at least) less complicated than today. Getting a terminal and text-based application to work is a lot easier than developing a web application or mobile app today.

Now, I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about Haskell, but one of (IMO) the elegant parts of Scheme is that you can choose when and where to use streams instead of lists.<p>The main benefits of streams vs. lists is usually composability, but also that delayed computation can save you from computing something you&#x27;ll never need. In this way, I think that being able to choose when and where you apply laziness is a huge gain. Now, of course this is where people will complain that streams are either a bad abstraction, or that doing stream-cons vs cons is annoying, but I like to think &quot;what if it was the other way around?&quot;. Namely, if you had streams used by default (a la laziness in Clojure), but could switch to lists when it was really necessary or made reasoning about your code easier.<p>Is there a language that does this smoothly? From what I understand, to work around laziness, you typically have to bend over backwards in Haskell, but if there was a good way to just transform lazy data structures into strict structures similar to the relationship between [stream]-map or [stream]-cons/car/cdr and the list equivalents, I think it&#x27;d be pretty exciting.

Contrary to what most people tell you, law can be pretty accessible. The problem is that if you try to become an expert on one issue, you&#x27;ll waste a lot of time and energy getting it right.

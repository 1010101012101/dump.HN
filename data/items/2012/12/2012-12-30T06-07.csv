Although these schools do say that they don't want money to be an issue, it truly is unfair for anyone to ask them for a free education, though deferment is perfectly valid <i>if they deliver their promise of making you good.</i> The initiative goes both ways.<p>The filter is very high. They get thousands of applicants for each cycle, so there has to be some convincing proof that you have what it takes. The implicit question from these schools is very simple: If you did NOT go to their school, would you have gained the requisite knowledge anyways through your own learning?<p>The reason they have to ask this question is multi-fold:<p>1- They are asking you to invest tons of time in very little time to learn and pick up all the skills they ask you to pick up.<p>2- They won't look good unless their students do good at the  class<p>3- They won't look good if their students don't get jobs.<p>And since this is a two-way street, what have you done to convince them that you will deliver on your promise to make them look good?<p>Examples:<p>1- Did you take, and become certified on any of those MOOC courses?<p>2- Have you created anything of significance like a website? I'm not talking about plugging up a WordPress Site without even customizing the CSS, but something where you had to understand the technology you were using, like hand-coding PHP and MySQL. Do you have anything in github?<p>3- What programming languages do you use? Have you attempted to learn anything more special, like Scala or Lisp, or are you still mucking around with whatever you began learning with?<p>I know the above sounds excessive, but it really isn't if you consider the goals involved, which means you are to get a good-paying job, and you were pretty much on your way anyways. Yes, it will probably take a tad more convincing if you are older, have no experience, and don't have any recent tough filters to prove your abilities to them. If these schools are to be taken seriously by future employers, they have to prove that they were tough to get into, because otherwise, saying you educate people to become junior-level programmers in 3 months would actually be a joke, not sound like one. The bar is set very high for these schools or they will go out of business, so set the bar very high for yourself first, then apply. Don't blame <i>them</i> for your age or your gender, because it is not likely that is what is happening here.",1356850009

2) How was the problem detected: automated monitoring, operator vigilance, or customer complaints?
3) When were customers first notified of the outage?<p>This post-mortem starts out with the root cause, but it is likely that was not known until after the outage had ended, so it's important to know how much time passed between the root cause event and when the on-call engineer(s) started treating the outage as such.<p>I'd also be interested in hearing about technical measures they will use to prevent this in the future.  It sounds like their mitigation measures are all social, not technical.  For example, do their configuration tools warn them when they are about the push out a huge delta?  Do they have a review process that forces two people to look at the change before it's put into action?  Would these have prevented the outage?<p>Finally, I think it's appalling (but not surprising) that it took many hours to revert their configs.  It sounds like the tools they are using are way too slow.  Any laptop can do an enormous amount of work in an hour; the computing resources available to Amazon can perform truly insane feats in one minute.

1) Pictures on menu's-Menu's change constantly because of food costs and trends. To have a new photo taken every time you make a menu change is too time consuming. Also, you don't want a crappy picture of your food on the menu and that means professional photographers and that means added costs.<p>2) Electronic Menu's etc-Good idea in theory, does not work (yet) in the real world. #1 and #1A reason restaurants won't do it is because of theft and breakage. To replace an iPad or whatever is too costly (sensing a theme here?)<p>3) CRM system that knows who you are and what you have ordered have been around forever BUT the Server who has 6 tables (and impatient customers) will not take the time to review it. It is not a problem technology can fix IMO<p>4) Technology to entertain the customer is called TV and Bartender (Sorry about being snarky)<p>It has been my experience that a majority of restaurant Owners and Operators will not invest in any technology (outside a POS) unless there is a proven, hard, ROI.

Even with you, comex, and a bunch of other people retweeting it, it ended up getting a grand total of $80.  And that was from a demographic that's deeply interested in such jailbreaks.<p>The likelihood of a device being broken is almost purely a function of interest; the interest just isn't there for the Surface, which is why the money I got is going to the EFF rather than buying a device (my contingency if the project didn't raise enough or raised too much).",1356848234

4984861,comment,4983684,4984131,2,0,quanticle,,,"Another point (raised in the comments to the original article) is that open data, like ""full disclosure"" security practices, levels the playing field. In other words, investment banks, city governments, and who have you already are doing these sorts of things. Open data allows us, the general public, to <i>see</i> them doing it. Yes, in your dystopia of Hobbesian all-against-all competition, we end up in an <i>Snow Crash</i>-esque agglomeration of specialized communities for increasingly narrow demographic segments.<p>But there is an alternate future. With open data (and increasingly cheap computing and communication devices), community organizers and the poor themselves can see exactly how they're being screwed over by the government. It will no longer be a nameless, faceless <i>they</i> that's inflicting pain and misery on them, but instead, specific actions, undertaken by specific individuals in specific offices. Corporations and governments won't be able to hide behind their usual practice of security by obscurity, since, with open data, it'll be possible for any citizen with a modicum of spare time and spare computing resources to run data analysis and come up with possibilites for why things are as screwed up as they are. We're already seeing this, with tech related laws and regulations. Open data makes it easy for any individual with an internet connection to track the progress of legislation. This was a major factor in galvanizing opposition to SOPA and PIPA. Making more data sets open and freely available will, in my estimation, benefit individuals far more than corporations or governments. Open data will do to closed-door decision making what full disclosure did to 0-day vulnerabilities.",1356847567

They target lots of architectures, focus on getting cross compilation working well, and spend a lot of time worrying about doing things ""right"" rather than expediently (for what it's worth; this can be good or bad depending on how you look at it). Their package manager/ports system is known as ""pkgsrc"", and also focuses on portability, such that it also runs on other platforms like Linux, Mac OS X, and so on. If you want to try porting a BSD to your odd little MIPS-based microcontroller, NetBSD is your best bet.<p>OpenBSD is focused extremely heavily on security. If you are paranoid, you want to run OpenBSD. If you are not paranoid, you should be. They are out to get you. Don't let them.<p>And the other major BSDs that you didn't ask about:<p>Dragonfly BSD is a sort of next-gen fork of FreeBSD, a bit more experimental. The biggest new feature is its HAMMER filesystem, which is in the class of modern filesystems like Btrfs and ZFS, supporting things like snapshots, checksumming of data and metadata, mirroring to backups, data deduplication, and the like. It also has other features like user-space virtual kernels, better parallelism, etc.<p>PC-BSD is designed to be a user-friendly, desktop-oriented BSD, which manages applications as separate bundles with installers, more similar to how they work on Windows on Mac OS X, than a traditional BSD ports system or Linux package manager which tries to manage shared dependencies (a PC-BSD package comes with all of its dependencies, which are installed separately from those of other packages).<p>OS X is a hybrid operating system, based on combining the Mach microkernel, FreeBSD, and some NetBSD tools, along with a proprietary UI layer and applications. It runs on desktops, laptops, and ARM-based smartphones. It is well known for its user-friendliness, tight integration between software and hardware, and draconian application development policies for its package management system, the App Store. Luckily, there are alternative ports systems available, such as MacPorts, Homebrew, and Cydia.",1356847489

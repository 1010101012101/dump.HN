Absolutley. 30% is not unreasonable compared to what you would pay a distributor and a publisher for shrink-wrapped software. Even then you would have to manage several stakeholders instead of just one. Visibility is also something Apple gives you if you are fortunate. Once your app hits the Top 100 charts or gets featured sales just take off like a rocket. I've been featured 3 times and while getting an Apple feature is rare, your chances are significantly improved if you have something unique and polished.",1312459113

First is the concern over the depth of the material. I don't have a CS degree and I'm mathematically out of shape (and I never even did a calculus class), so I'm concerned about making it to a certain point and then completely failing to be able to continue on. Second is a concern about copyright and plagiarism. I've never been clear where the line is with regards to the sort of summarizing knowledge of a whole book, since paraphrasing is still plagiarism AFAIK. Less of an issue with SICP, I'm sure, since you ended up with a signed copy, but I'm a very risk-averse individual and like to know exactly where I stand before attempting such a thing.<p>I'm sure that your blog will be a great resource for me when I do my version of your project, so I'd like to thank you in advance for having blazed the trail for me.",1312456066

Also your solution makes it easy to move on to a logarithmic time solution: going from (a,b,c) to (b,c,3a+2b+c) is a linear transformation which can be expressed as a 3x3 matrix, therefore iterating it n times is equivalent to raising that matrix to the nth power, which can be done in log(n) time using square and multiply [1].  Disregard programming, study math!<p>In fact the exact same reasoning can be used to derive the closed form expression for the Fibonacci numbers [2], which are defined by a recurrence relation similar to the one in the OP. You raise the corresponding 2x2 matrix to the nth power by going to the eigenbasis where the matrix becomes diagonal, raising the values on the diagonal (which turn out to be the golden ratio (phi) and -1/phi) to the nth power, then changing the basis back.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Closed-form_expression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Closed-form_ex...</a>",1312455773

You can tell this is the case because the administration has been saber rattling for the last four years, and starting to work their way into currency controls.<p>Did you know, in order to renounce, you have to get the <i>permission</i> of the government? They charge an exit tax too for your funds.  This is a currency control and it is one of the things that marked the soviet union as a bad regime.  If you can't move your money in and out of a country, then you're not likely to invest in that country.<p>I'm not very rich, and I will renounce as soon as my second citizenship gets in.

2845417,comment,2844722,2845315,5,0,gjm11,,,"> Once you've seen a multi-touch touchscreen work, it isn't hard to work out how to make a capacitive touchscreen do it.<p>I can't comment on whatever patents Apple may have, because I haven't read them, but the above is surely an oversimplification.<p>Let me describe how a typical capacitive touch sensor works. It's basically a grid of wires, one set running horizontally and the other vertically. (They aren't really wires, and the difference matters a lot for multiple reasons, but we can ignore it here.) For each wire, you can measure (kinda) whether a user's finger is near to it, and how near if so. (Because the finger will couple to it capacitively, which changes how the wire responds when you wiggle its voltage up and down.) So you use the horizontal wires to measure where the finger is vertically, and the vertical wires to measure where it is horizontally.<p>So far, so good. Now you want to make it work with multiple fingers. Problem 1: if you have a finger at position (3,3) and another at (10,10), what you see is (crudely) lots of coupling to wires 3 and 10 on each axis. But that is also what you'd see from a finger at (3,10) and another at (10,3). How do you tell the difference? Problem 2: if you have a finger at (3,3) and another at (3.5,10) then you can see the y-coordinates clearly enough but the signals on the x-measuring wires are going to be hard to disentangle.<p>These are not trivial problems to solve. (I know of a few approaches. I don't know what Apple actually do. I have worked for a company that makes capacitive position sensors, but not for Apple. Nothing I've said here is anyone's trade secret.) The more-obvious things you might do to try to solve them all have substantial difficulties. And of course these aren't the only difficulties in making a multi-touch capacitive touchscreen. (Making a decent capacitive touchscreen at all isn't trivial, though it's pretty much a solved problem nowadays.)<p>So this is exactly the sort of situation in which, in an ideal world with a sensible patent system, patents might be the Right Thing: there's a tricky technical problem, it's solvable but you can't just Do The Obvious Thing and have it work, so having someone find a good solution, publish it, but still be able to get commercial advantage from it seems like a pretty good outcome for everyone. (Note: this does not constitute an endorsement of how patents currently are in the real world.)",1312455736

636666,comment,636335,636443,0,0,jerf,,,"I reject moral relativism. I have no problem saying ""The government shouldn't be able to kill you and your family when you complain about them in public.""<p>As you might imagine, I'm rather familiar with the arguments in favor of moral relativism, but I can't quite seem to forget that they are, in part, an argument that it's ok for <i>some</i> governments to kill people who disagree with them, merely because they disagree with them. It makes me worry that perhaps someday they'll get around to telling me that now <i>my</i> government is one of the privileged governments.<p>So, even if I'm perhaps stretching the truth about my private beliefs, in public, I'm going to stand up and say that free speech is a right of all humans without shame.<p>(BTW, there's a number of subsets in here. I am aware that free speech is not the sum total of morality, for instance. Moreover, you'll find that my morality is permitted to be more complicated than you might think; an absolutist can freely incorporate relativism when desirable, whereas a true relativist can't let even one absolute in or the whole thing comes down and they are back on absolutist grounds. The moral question of ""how much respect should be shown for elders?"" is much more flexible than ""can you murder someone for arbitrary reasons?"".)",1243886096
636664,comment,636478,636567,0,0,mdasen,,,"I'd argue that it's more a lack of options/timing.  MovableType was once big and then they offended the community which saw an exodus, mostly to WordPress.  WordPress was really they only equivalent back then.  Even today, there aren't a lot of options.  Typo (on Rails) wasn't well maintained for a while and many cheap hosts still don't play that well with Ruby/Rails.  There are a few Python blogs (and more than a few use Django), but again many hosts don't support Python well.<p>WordPress really has that thousands of monkeys banging on a keyboard thing going for it.  There are just so many users who have created little plugins.  Most of WordPress might be crap, but no one wants to spend time on something of such low-value (code-wise) as a blog and WordPress meets most needs.  It's slow, it has poor security, its interface leaves a lot to be desired (keeps getting more complicated in my opinion), but it works well enough.<p>Just look at the options.  You can run MovableType in its Perl/PHP comboness.  You can run an under-featured Python blog based off one of those many frameworks and then get annoyed that there isn't anti-spam protection.  You could try a Rails blog like Typo or Mephisto, but you have to deal with getting a host that supports Ruby well (no problem for me, but definitely for many).  And Typo never seems to quite keep pace with Rails.<p>Users do care about elegance.  It's just that elegance is sometimes not built (like the number of Django blogs that are missing even simple things that you don't notice at first) or just don't see the type of life that WordPress has because they came later.<p>WordPress is elegant enough for most people while other solutions have deal-breakers in them for many people.",1243886040

It's not for lack of options, but like many parts of Drupal, the automated install process hasn't ""stayed still"" for more than a version for the best practices to really evolve.  The most famous way is something called Install Profile.  The definition and underpinnings of this module have changed drastically from version to version, and it is not that well documented.<p>A more recent entrant is a system called Aegir which is a set of multiple modules.  There is also a Drupal shell called Drush that can automate some things, but obviously it itself needs to be present and installed to be utilitzed :D.<p>Myself? I've written an ugly bash script that basically downloads and  moves all the modules into place, and talks to mysql to enable them. I would never advise anybody else to use this method, or at least not use my script ;D<p>In a recent Lullabot podcast (probably the most well-known, and definitely most helpful Drupal-based business I know of), they referred to a database-centric way of automating installs that sounded like it could also be just a db script.  They promised a blog post, which I am eagerly anticipating.<p>Anyway, your main point about Drupal setup being cumbersome, is true.  Most people whose work is all Drupal have ways to deal with this, but if Drupal is only a small part of your computing life, it's not obvious what the best practice is.",1243885089

In that sense, at least, it has some value.<p>The article on the other hand: I've already read it a lot of times. First there were the articles that GM may declare bankruptcy, then there were the articles how GM is more likely to declare bankruptcy, then there were the articles how GM is one step closer to bankruptcy and now, finally, GM declares bankruptcy. All these articles were the same, apart from the headline, every one of those articles were published in a gazillion sources, none adding interesting commentary, and then all of it repeated because some European/local car maker depends on GM and needed to be sold. I've read one of those articles and I've read them all.<p>I think in that sense the ""if it was on TV, it shouldn't be here""-thing is quite valid: You'll encounter it everywhere and there's no value in discussing it here, because it has been discussed to death already.<p>Now, I don't really like the metacommentary either, even though I'm participating in it, but I do think the article gets undue credit.

Culminating in the late financial system coup de grace.<p>My point is that the issue of free speech does not seem to be related to the probability of having poor governance.  And this is coming from a person who was a pretty big believer in free speech being a guarantor of good governance.<p>On a related note, a story from Ningbo.  This is a small place, about 2.5 million people south of Shanghai.  If China has an Austin-Berkeley-Madison feel city, this is probably it.  Anyway, the police chase down a guy for theft and the guy made a such a big stink about it that a crowd couldn't help but to watch.  He protested, vehemently, that the police were brutalizing him.  My Mandarin is good enough to understand that he also had some choice words about their collective character.  Finally, he demanded to speak to his attorney.  What struck me was this . . . the guy never said ""there's about to be a gross miscarriage of justice!"", or ""You have the wrong man!"", or ""I didn't do it!""  He said the police were brutal and he wanted his lawyer.  That spoke volumes to me about the rights of the individual in China.  It was my ah-hah! moment.  I felt like the young Michael Corleone in the Godfather II.  Realizing Fidel would win, after watching a confrontation in Havana between a group of rebels and Batista's army.  The people of China will be fine.  Maybe there are some wrinkles to iron out here or there, but if criminals feel free enough to cry ""police brutality!"" and ""I want my lawyer!"" when they get arrested, you're probably doing ok.",1243883063

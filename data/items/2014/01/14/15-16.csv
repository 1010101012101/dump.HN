7057618,comment,7047001,7047611,1,0,DjangoReinhardt,,,"Sorry for hijacking this comment thread but I&#x27;d like to share a few of my personal experiences in this process.<p>---------------<p>As a high-school student, I remember my entire school participated in the early years of this drive. I remember students being assigned specific areas of my town - groups of three to five, assigned an area consisting of a few blocks of multi-storeyed apartments. Each group was asked to canvass and get names of kids under five years of age in every house in their assigned area.<p>If you were wondering why any of us would bother to put in an honest shift, the collection of said kids&#x27; names was &#x27;gamified&#x27; to some extent. Moreover, for us kids, it was simply time away from school, i.e. no lessons, no teachers, just us friends going from door-to-door. Schools would be given points based on the accuracy of data. (I am still not sure how they decided this but that&#x27;s what we were told anyway. It sure helped to keep the lazy miscreants among us on the straight and narrow.) The data collected by the students would then be handed over to the authorities in charge of the vaccination process, who would then draw up a list of vaccination centers.<p>One of the more interesting things was broadcasting a single, &#x27;target&#x27; date every year for mass vaccinations. The government would broadcast this date (typically the second or third Sunday of January) over various media and also conduct last-mile publicity campaigns with a loudspeaker blaring reminders in every area as the &#x27;target&#x27; date came closer.<p>Bear in mind, these vaccines were usually available at government-run clinics and hospitals on any given day of the year but setting a target date ensured that people allocated time out of their schedules. Furthermore, since the target date was always a Sunday, almost everyone could be convinced to make an appearance. That being said, there was an additional arrangement to ensure that those who didn&#x27;t/couldn&#x27;t make it to a center on a target date still wouldn&#x27;t miss out on that all-important dose of vaccine.<p>As for us students, our contribution to the process did not stop with the collection of data. Since our school was a center for mass-vaccinations, we were expected to sit at the vaccination booths and cross-check the arriving vaccinees (is that a word? Never mind, it is now...) against the lists we created and ensure that every kid on that list got vaccinated. Think elections, but for vaccination.<p>Furthermore, we were made to go to their houses with volunteers carrying medicines and ensure that kids who couldn&#x27;t/hadn&#x27;t made an appearance yet didn&#x27;t miss out on the vaccine.<p>I can&#x27;t remember if any of these efforts earned us extra points on our annual grades but hey, we were happy enough to get &#x27;school-sanctioned loitering time&#x27; on a school-day!<p><TL;DR> As a school student, my school ensured that I played a small part in the early days of this campaign. While most of us did it for shits and giggles, it is only now that we realize that we played a small part in the process and can feel proud of putting in an honest shift all those years ago.<p>Credit must go to the people who designed and executed this campaign ceaselessly over the last twenty years.

The BBC and the New Yorker are both professionally managed news organizations, but I think people don&#x27;t appreciate how practiced BGI is at playing two weaknesses of most news organizations: (1) the gee-whiz factor of China as a still mysterious country where most reporters can&#x27;t speak the local language(s) and the government still controls the press and (2) the gee-whiz factor of genetics research as a developing science that seemingly explains everything. I have a lot of in-person and online acquaintance with genetics researchers, and so far it looks like BGI is overhyping and underdelivering in the usual manner of the science news cycle.[1]<p>Particularly if we are talking about new developments in animal husbandry, an important industry all over the world where people eat meat or use leather, what is economical to do in one country may not be economical to do in another country, and national barriers to free trade in animal products on dubious scientific grounds are still very much a factor in international trade (and thus domestic prices) for animal products. So maybe this is a big deal for hog producers in other countries, or maybe not. The comment already posted here that the scale described in the article kindly submitted here counts as small-scale rather than &quot;industrial scale&quot; in the United States is correct--some of my cousins are hog producers, and they keep track of all the latest technology in the industry.<p>Here on Hacker News, we have had several discussions of gee-whiz stories about predicted future developments in China that end up never happening. (How many of you remember the many stories about the prefab skyscraper that was to be built in a matter of days?) Predicting the future in China is easy these days: just predict something amazing and seemingly impossible anywhere else, and watch the journalists lap it up. But sometimes the future never comes to China. Anyone who raises hogs for a living will follow this news closely, but whether this news will change any practices in the worldwide industry as a whole remains to be seen.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=117"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174</a><p>AFTER EDIT: From another comment in a different subthread here,<p><i>They&#x27;ve already invested in researching the large patchwork of genes that are correlated with high IQ.</i><p>And that is why I think BGI is more hype than substance. So far BGI has not produced any publishable results from that research. When it has publishable results, I venture to predict, the results will show that any one gene, and any assemblages of genes that they find, will have limited effect on phenotype for IQ.

In our view, excitement over the value of behavioral and molecular genetic studies in the social sciences should be tempered—as it has been in the medical sciences—by an appreciation that, for complex phenotypes, individual common genetic variants of the sort assayed by SNP microarrays are likely to have very small effects.&quot;",1389714462

7057579,comment,7056295,7057144,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Am I right in assuming that I can not find any such element with my &quot;intuition&quot;, but the axiom guarantees that there is a least element?<p>Well... the second half of that is true.  As to the first half, it&#x27;s not so much that you can&#x27;t find such an element... you could arbitrarily designate any number in the interval as the &quot;least element&quot;, and that would be fine.<p>Going into it a little more:<p>Talking about ordering a set, we can define an ordering relation, traditionally called something like <= , to compare two elements. It can be pretty much anything at all; for example, over the set {1,2,3,8} I could define the relation like so, with five parts: 1 <= 1; 2 <= 2; 3 <= 3; 8 <= 8; 2 <= 8.  That reflects the idea that they&#x27;re all equal to themselves, and 2 is less than 8.  Any other pair, like 2 and 3, is incomparable under the relation I&#x27;ve defined.  In that set, under that relation, the subset {3} has a least element, 3; the subset {2,8} has a least element, 2; and the subset {1,3} doesn&#x27;t have a least element because 1 and 3 are incomparable.<p>For a set to be well-ordered, you need some additional properties:<p>- the order relation must be total, that is, every two elements must be comparable to each other.<p>- every subset must have a least element under the relation<p>Using the standard numeric comparison <= , the positive integers are well ordered: any subset, even an infinite one has a least element (though not necessarily a greatest element).  The integers are not well ordered under numeric comparison, as they have no least element (-4 is less than -3, but -5 is even less, and so on).  But I can easily define a well order &quot;W&quot; on the integers by saying: a W b iff |a| < |b| or (|a| = |b| and a <= b).  That W relation produces the order 0 W -1 W 1 W -2 W 2 W -3 ....... , and I can use it to define a least element of any subset of integers.<p>But you don&#x27;t have to have an elegant-looking rule to define a well-order.  As long as you can choose a least element from any subset, you&#x27;re good.  So if you say &quot;the least element, in my well ordering, of the interval (0,1) is the square root of 1/2&quot;, there isn&#x27;t any problem with that.<p>However, a constructivist will ask you &quot;what is the least element of the set consisting of all real numbers between 0 and 1, except the square root of 1/2?&quot;.  And it can be hard to justify the numbers you pick.  So I guess human intuition usually doesn&#x27;t extend to the idea that you can just keep picking seemingly-arbitrary least elements indefinitely (and since the reals are uncountable, you&#x27;d actually have to do that an uncountable number of times).<p>The axiom of choice solves the problem pretty directly; one of its standard formulations is<p><pre><code>    For any collection of nonempty sets, there is a &quot;choice function&quot; f\n    which maps every set in the collection to one of its own elements\n</code></pre>\nAnd so to well-order the reals, you just say <i>the collection of sets will be the set of subsets of the reals, and the least element of any given subset is the value of the choice function</i> f <i>for that subset</i>.<p>EDIT:<p>The part in italics above is incorrect (I don&#x27;t know how to produce strikethrough, or if it can even be done).  This always messes me up. In my head, you just repeat the process I described above an impossibly large number of times: least element to be <i>f</i>(R), second least element to be <i>f</i>(R without the least element), etc. But as I mentioned elsewhere, that intuition always leads me into &quot;all sets are countable&quot;, which I know is wrong. :(<p>Anyway, given a subset of R, you can&#x27;t just apply the choice function; you&#x27;d have to start from R and keep applying the choice function and removing values until you got one which was in your subset.",1389714283

7057563,comment,7056614,7056614,100,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Soverain from an adverse ruling by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals that had determined the Soverain &quot;shopping cart&quot; patent to be invalid on grounds of obviousness.<p>2. The Federal Circuit&#x27;s holding by a 3-judge panel <i>had</i> been remarkable and had shocked patent lawyers generally in that the parties before the court <i>had not even raised</i> the issue on appeal as a ground for invalidating the jury&#x27;s verdict below. The court raised the issue on its own, concluded that the patent was obvious and invalid, and gave judgment for Newegg in spite of the fact that the jury at the trial court level had found that Newegg infringed.<p>3. This particular patent had been <i>the</i> original shopping cart patent, dating back to 1994 (well before Amazon began) and it had had a formidable history by which its holder had gotten massive licensing fees from major players over many years for the privilege of using online shopping carts on the web.<p>4. It is easy to say today that everyone knows what the concept of a shopping cart is and that anyone could have come up with the idea of applying that concept to online shopping. That is all well and good but consider this: not only had this patent passed muster as being non-obvious with the USPTO on its original filing but it had also been found to have been non-obvious on two separate patent re-examinations before that same body and by a string of U.S. district court judges before whom the issue had arisen. In other words, Newegg faced a <i>huge</i> challenge on this issue (the legal standard required that it be able to prove that it was obvious by &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidence, which is often a tough standard to meet) and this is why Amazon and virtually all other major other online retailers had long since caved and agreed to pay royalties for use of the patent. In the patent community, the Soverain patent was seen as rock solid and one whose shopping cart idea was deemed far from obvious. The top judges and lawyers in the nation, not to mention the USPTO, had all so concluded. The chances of upending it seemed slim to none. And, as noted, even the parties themselves had not raised the issue on the key appeal as a ground for potential reversal. Thus, everyone was <i>stunned</i> when the Federal Circuit reversed the judgment against Newegg on that ground, invalidated the patent, and threw the case out.<p>5. All that said, when Soverain petitioned the Supreme Court for review of the Federal Circuit&#x27;s decision, it was trying to undo what it perceived as an injustice done to it as a private litigant (&quot;this is so unfair to us and to our valuable patent&quot;). However, from the Supreme Court&#x27;s point of view, the kind of petition filed by Soverain is to be granted, and a case heard, only when it has significance far beyond whatever impact it might have on any private litigant. The Court&#x27;s role in hearing such discretionary appeals is to step in and decide important questions of federal law or to determine who is right when the various lower federal appellate courts may have reached conflicting decisions on such points of law in way that cries out of definitive resolution by the highest court. The Court will not hear cases merely because they might have been wrongly decided unless some such extraordinary factor exists. Thus, in denying Soverain&#x27;s petition, the Court did nothing more than say that this particular petition did not present important issues of the kind that warranted its attention. It did not validate the Federal Circuit&#x27;s reasoning or analysis. It did not weigh in against patent trolls. It did not add its authority to the fight against frivolous patents. It simply did what it does on over 99% of such discretionary petitions: it used its discretion to deny it. The legal significance of its decision goes no farther than that.<p>6. Is Soverain a patent troll that deserved this outcome? Well, its CEO had been a law partner at a major law firm (Latham & Watkins) and the company&#x27;s business was clearly driven by a legal licensing scheme that had little or nothing to do with active business operations or innovation. It had simply acquired the original company that had come up with the patent back in the day. So, it is a troll if you want to call it that or it is not if you want to use some different definition. But this distinction does underscore how difficult it becomes to analyze patent issues simply by placing labels on the parties. The problem with modern software patents is that too many are too easily granted over trivial &quot;innovations&quot; and this has given vast incentives to those who would package them into shakedown licensing ventures and thereby gum things up for true innovators. It is a situation that calls for action by Congress to rein this in. Otherwise, every party trying to defend itself will find itself, as Newegg did, having to go to extraordinary efforts at massive expense to avoid claims of infringement. Very few litigants can do that and, indeed, Newegg is to be commended for fighting this all the way against tough odds. Let us only hope that systemic fixes can help correct the problem so that this is not the only way available for dealing with such patents. Whatever else this system does, it hardly promotes true innovation.",1389714062

I mean, it&#x27;s a good thing that anyone can provision infrastructure with an API call, but there are two things I&#x27;m worried about:<p>- vendor lock-in: by integrating whoever&#x27;s API in your code and making it part of your application you make it hard to switch to a similar service offered by someone else. Example: say you&#x27;re writing a service that has to scale automatically. Cool, you can do this with EC2&#x27;s APIs, so you integrate that in your application. When the threshold of request per second crosses a certain value, you spin up a new VM. If it&#x27;s deeply integrated with Amazon&#x27;s APIs (i.e you&#x27;re using it to its full potential, tracking spot instances, whatever) it&#x27;s very hard to switch to DigitalOcean, because they might have different concepts, and I&#x27;m not talking about just nomenclature.<p>- black box syndrome: you stop knowing how things work.

It&#x27;s about how often heating or cooling is used when the occupants don&#x27;t need it.<p>> 3) The public is stupid, far too dumb to program something, so lets prey on them with something real expensive that tries to avoid that.<p>The only thing I said on this is that most programmable thermostats have bad UI and I&#x27;d extend that bad UI to note that they also tend to assume a rigid schedule. \nIt came as no surprise to me when I read the government studies concluding that programmable thermostats: the Honeywell which my Nest replaced allowed you to set two temperatures per day and there was no way to adjust for changes in your schedule without clicking through the entire schedule — 3 (hour, minute, AM/PM) pairs with two high/low temperature thresholds for 7 days or almost 40 clicks on low-quality buttons which would have shamed a $2 calculator. If you knew you were going to be out late one evening, do you spend 15 minutes clicking through that UX disaster or just say “Meh, we&#x27;ll heat the house for a couple extra hours”? Maybe you plan to go out for a couple hours mid-day? There&#x27;s no way to express that short of turning the entire thing off, which is fine part of the year and annoying during the rest when it means you&#x27;ll come home to a very hot/cold house because there&#x27;s no way to say “Keep the house over 50° (or under 80°) for the next few hours”.<p>That&#x27;s not saying that the public is stupid, it&#x27;s saying that there&#x27;s been a market failure in producing decent thermostats. It&#x27;d be great if there were options between the Nest and the junk $30 thermostats for people who wanted more intelligence (or just the silly auto-away sensor) but don&#x27;t mind, say, cheap plastic fittings or losing some of the more processor-intensive features.<p>> 5) Its OK to rip people off as long as you don&#x27;t rip them off for more money than other people do.<p>You&#x27;re arguing against something which I didn&#x27;t write.<p>> 7) Paraphrase to something like I don&#x27;t like the results of your math equations, so I&#x27;ll call you smug instead.

Using terms like “ripped off” implies a moral judgement rather than, say, people making decisions based on different circumstances.

You have to deliver at scale.</i><p>I disagree there. All the examples you stated developed gradually starting small and expanding. The first railways appeared in Europe in the 14th century and didn&#x27;t really take off until the 18th century with the development of the steam engine.<p>Even air travel, which went from the first heavier-than-air flight to first commercial flight in a remarkably short period of time of about 27 years, piggybacked off of earlier lighter-than-air travel that had existed for centuries. In the Napoleonic Wars, balloons were used for surveilling the battle field, and airships appeared in the mid 19th century. People already knew that air travel was commercially viable and militarily useful. Heavier-than-air machines were a major improvement on the concept, not something entirely new.<p>This is a common theme in technology: a primitive form of the technology exists for a long period of time in niches. Then, after a period of time, there&#x27;s a key invention -- the steam engine for rail travel, the dynamo for electricity, the airplane for air travel, the transistor for computers -- that causes the technology to explode in a short period of time.<p>That key invention is the last piece in the puzzle, not the first. The earlier developments prove the viability of the concept, build up the infrastructure to support it, and justify large investments in developing the key invention. But if you don&#x27;t look at the history <i>before</i> the key invention, you&#x27;d think that computers and electric generators and railroads and aircraft appeared suddenly and had large amounts of capital suddenly invested in them.<p>And that brings us back to my original point: all those technologies had clear advantages over their predecessors. What advantage does an all-solar future have over a mix of sources? Simply getting rid of fossil fuels is not good enough.",1389712991

Theoretically, if you could manipulate a Super Nintendo controller with perfect precision 60 times per second you could reproduce this.<p>Specifically, some objects in-game have pointers to code associated with them (&quot;what to do if this block gets hit by a turtle shell&quot;, that sort of thing).  The P-switch has one of these pointers assigned to a very special value by coincidence: its pointer points to the memory location where button presses are mapped.  This pointer is never supposed to be followed, but by making a bunch of objects very carefully the authors can glitch the game into jumping to that memory address.  Once execution is there, they can write a bootloader by making sure the button inputs on each frame correspond to the correct opcodes, letting them execute arbitrary code that they write in on the controller port.<p>I wasn&#x27;t involved in the production of this TAS, so I&#x27;m not an expert, but that&#x27;s my understanding of what&#x27;s going on.",1389712926

For example, let&#x27;s say you need to often check whether an element matches a specific CSS selector. That&#x27;s easy with `elem.matchesSelector(selector)` but the browser has to assume the selector could be something complex like `#content li > ul input[type=&quot;number&quot;]` just as easily as it could be `#phone`. Plus it has to parse the selector every time (or maintain a complex cache). If you as the developer know the selector always an ID you can just check for `elem.id === &quot;phone&quot;` in JavaScript and that will whip the pants off the C++ code that has to deal with an arbitrary selector.<p>I&#x27;d like to see what assumptions famo.us has made and whether they could have just been addressed at the CSS level. An example of that would be things like overlapping elements with rounded corners and drop shadows, which are very expensive for the rendering engine. So perhaps it was a lack of understanding of CSS jank factors that led them to decide a total circumvention was in order? We&#x27;d really need to see a side-by-side of the two and understand where the conventional solution was bogging down.",1389712360

No, this isn&#x27;t how policing should work. I&#x27;m going to rant a little here. Policing is not a tool to entrap folks or assume folks are negative first and react to it. I&#x27;m guessing NYPD has a bigger budget and have more folks and ran out of things to do, so they need these programs to feed their &quot;quota&quot; or something.<p>I understand that in some situations, being proactive is the only way to tackle the problem but this isn&#x27;t one of them. Larceny cannot be beaten out of folks, it&#x27;s been here forever and never going to work with this program.<p>I&#x27;d go as far as saying that in some cases, larceny is a natural reaction to the society (think stealing bread/money to survive on the street due to oppression or no available resources to help folks).<p>Policing should be about discouraging this in the first place by helping folks and negate the reason to perform larceny in the first place. Why did that person needed to steal the wallet, because it was fun? If yes, then he should be educated in what really happens to the victim. If because he needed money to buy meds for his son, then we as a society need to work on that that no children should ever have to be in that situation (yes, I knew some folks who did this and they were in horrible situations that the city couldn&#x27;t help them with).<p>For me, all this program is doing is:<p>1. Discouraging the society from helping each other. I&#x27;m now never ever going to pick up any wallet or anything to return it to its owners or the cops because I don&#x27;t know if it is a trap or not. This is what China did and well, some of the things the folks ignored were disgusting (such as a kid getting run over by cars and people are just walking around because they fear getting caught doing something wrong).<p>This is stupid. If thieves are going to steal, they&#x27;re going to steal but there are many more good people who will do the right thing. I don&#x27;t see the cops awarding the good behavior.<p>2. They have better things to do, no? How about instead of spending time entrapping people, walk their beats, and helping the community. Spend time getting to know the folks, know right away if they need help or not based on how they&#x27;re behaving.<p>I&#x27;m sure many of you will disagree and thinks this is a good program.

It&#x27;s now just a distinction between who manages a system and who uses that system.<p>If you want to manage a system instead of just using it, you can achieve that by having your own entire system by spawning a container or VM, rather than just being limited to your home directory.<p>The cost in disk space is negligible in today&#x27;s terms.

Universities are non-practicing entities. They share some characteristics with trolls, at least if the term is broadly defined, but they are not trolls. Asking what distinguishes universities from trolls can actually help us figure out what concerns us about trolls. What we ought to do is abandon the search for a group of individual companies to define as trolls. In my view, troll is as troll does. Universities will sometimes be bad actors. Nonmanufacturing patent owners will sometimes be bad actors. Manufacturing patent owners will sometimes be bad actors. Instead of singling out bad actors, we should focus on the bad acts and the laws that make them possible.</i>",1389711694

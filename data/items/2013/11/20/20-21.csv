6771117,comment,6770869,6770869,3,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Instead of creating the atomic elements needed to support generic data structures then adding a suite of them to the standard library, the Go team went the other way. There was a concrete use case for good data structures, and so they were added. Attempting a deep reconciliation with the rest of the language was a secondary requirement that was so unimportant that it fell by the wayside for Go 1.x.<p>For the last year or so, Go has essentially been my primary language. Before that, my primary languages were Python and Lisp (various dialects).<p>I don&#x27;t think that anybody who uses Go extensively will deny that they have some feature $X that they&#x27;d love to have added to Go[0]. (For me, I miss being able to use some common Lisp idioms).<p>However, what I like the most about Go is that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> &quot;just add it&quot; simply because some people suggest it, the way that other languages might. The feature set is incredibly minimal - while it&#x27;s impossible to get rid of <i>all</i> redundancy, programming in Go is a very consistent experience, because everything that&#x27;s been done feels like it&#x27;s been done the right way[1].<p>Also, from the original post (the one that this blog post partially retracts):<p>>  the exhilarating sense of weightlessness that you get when hacking in Python is largely due to the fact that the language works really, really hard to optimize this process. Go has given away this feeling of exhilaration, basically for nothing.<p>Hopefully the author now realizes that what Go gives up (only marginally) in &quot;weightlessness&quot; while developing is made up more than tenfold when maintaining code.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t bat an eyelid anymore when I need to refactor Go code, even if I&#x27;ve forgotten to write tests[2]. It doesn&#x27;t take anywhere near as long as refactoring Python takes me, and I don&#x27;t worry as much about introducing logical errors (or worse, runtime exceptions).<p>[0] Incidentally, &quot;generics&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to be a common complaint among people who have actually programmed in Go for a moderate length of time, anecdotally.<p>[1] Yes, this is subjective.<p>[2] Yes, I know. Always write tests. But still.",1384980926

Buy your PC from one company, and if their memory upgrade price was too high, buy your memory from another. (And your graphics card from another, and your hard drive from another...).<p>It&#x27;s my hope that eventually similar standards will evolve for tablets (and laptops, and perhaps phones) that allow a consumer to easily modify or custom build a compatible device.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have high expectations that this will actually happen. The market just doesn&#x27;t seem to be applying the right pressure to have any companies interested in doing such a thing.<p>(Out of interest, can anyone with more knowledge comment on how this standardization came about for PC&#x27;s.

There is <i>no</i> reason to think that a Gini of, say, .7 leads to plutocrats or monopolies any more/less so than a Gini of .4.<p>Plutocrats derive power from their wealth. The Pluto Problem (haha, couldn&#x27;t resist) is not due to society wide inequality levels, but rather to a political system which enables them to derive said power. Finally, if you look at the richest people in the US such as Gates, Buffet and the Waltons, I don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;ll find they have political power even remotely similar to plutocrats such as Berlusconi. Point being that, in my opinion, Plutocrats don&#x27;t exist in the US. Are there rich, politically powerful people in the US? Yes. Are there people who derive immense political power solely through said wealth? I would say no. It&#x27;s more likely to work the other way around (political power leads to wealth - as in the case of the Clintons and now Obama).<p>People may discuss examples such as Romeny et al, but he&#x27;s <i>only</i> worth $250 million.

That is very well understood now. It had nothing to do with what Greece&#x27;s populace wanted.<p>The irony of the article is that it attempts to use today&#x27;s terrorist actions and claim them for collectivism. In fact al qaeda started by bombing soviets, because they were collectivist. They got help from the US (because collectivist systems hated religion up to two decades ago. Marx hated religion, as is very well known).<p>As if that wasn&#x27;t proof enough you have the &quot;arab spring&quot; and what it was really pushing. That&#x27;s pretty clear at this point. In Egypt, Lybia, ... and it wasn&#x27;t collectivism. It wasn&#x27;t equality. It was the very opposite of that. It was pushing an extreme view of repressive, very capitalist religion. One that espouses a slave-based economy, and a form of society that has a reputation across the planet for being by far the worst society for a slave to live under. A religion that pushes selling humans. A religion that praises trading, pillaging the earth, and all you seem to hate, to a far greater extent than our capitalist system does. 9/11 and related bombings were executed by people associated with this system, not with collectivism of any kind.<p>Another massive self-deception is that most of these collectivists, at least the ones discussing it in European cafes where I live, are universally part of this &quot;elite&quot;. But they themselves are innocent, see, because they &quot;try to help&quot;. Not by working, obviously. It &quot;somehow&quot; escapes their attention that most people in the cafe nextdoor, the cafe that used to be filled with car mechanics, drivers and ... and now is filled with call center employees, hate them for this. And they hate them because they can effectively do nothing and discuss collectivism all day.<p>To me, the article reads like another intellectual looking at society, and seeing exactly what he thought was going on all along. Like with the Egypt &quot;revolution&quot; for democracy. Hah ! In reality US society is fraying in hundred different small ways, mostly due to pressures coming from the outside. But the basic problem is this :<p>We have 7 billion people on this planet, and we only need ~1 billion or so for the economy. That 1 billion figure is dropping fast, and we&#x27;ve reached the point where the US&#x27;s 300 million are not isolated from it any more. But you know what ? Historically, that&#x27;s only strange if you look at the last 100 years. If you look at the last 1000 years, that&#x27;s merely the status-quo.",1384980446

I admit the majority of my interest in this video was to see if the problems with doing cryptography in JavaScript were going to be responded to. The problems are not ignored, as the presenter immediately brings up the requisite matasano article [2]. Then he makes some vague claim that doesn&#x27;t respond to the problems mentioned in the article. The majority of his time was spent on this:<p>His claim: Matasano is worried about a man in the middle attack and thinks that SSL is good enough.<p>His response: &quot;I call bullshit. SSL is protection from other people on the wire. Cryptography is protection for you on the wire. Why should you trust me to store your data without reading it?&quot;<p>This completely ignores the major issue of the execution environment with JavaScript cryptography. He actually does briefly mention these issues before making the point above, but offers no response. So, there is really no content in the talk about &quot;bringing crypto to the masses.&quot; Disappointing.<p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/</a>",1384979851

And not just because they wanted to avoid paying for music, but because the service model is just a pain in the ass compared to the self-service model.<p>&quot;It could have been Pandora&quot; ignores the fact that Pandora basically sucks and people just tolerate it.  People want to be in control of their software despite what the business fucks running &quot;IT&quot; think now, conceptualizing a &quot;service&quot; where none is needed, trying to pull infinite profit from such trivial functions such as routing packets correctly or parsing compressed audio and routing it through hardware to a speaker without pointless and pathetic DRM algorithms trying to detect time-skewed copyright audio.. sigh.  by setting the bar so low that people think that shitfuck-suck software is what you have to put up with unless you have &quot;long term support&quot; or other wedges into your conceptual/computational sovereignty to do something as simple as publish a document and expect it to be readable on another computer in 10 years, a problem that was solved 200 years ago is now the cutting edge of business technology and development, fueling well known multinationals such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.<p>Computing never was meant to be a platform for economic revolution, it just abstracts away paper work.

I won&#x27;t say the internet bubble is over until the world is actually simpler with computers instead of way, way more complicated and outright retarded in many aspects.<p>NO, WINAMP DIDN&#x27;T FAIL, in contrary, economic motivations failed to make Winamp suck, failed to steal a public resource and public work. Failed to co-opt the direction and passion of artists. AOL failed to capitalize on selfless engineering that actually solved a problem the correct way, it failed to corrupt the best solution with advertising indicators and economic feedback loops built into a market, shoehorned into an audio player.

Some of the techniques for cheating on statistics that he has discovered and named include &quot;p-hacking,&quot;[3] and he has published a checklist of procedures to follow to ensure more honest and replicable results.[4]<p>From Jelte Wicherts writing in Frontiers of Computational Neuroscience (an open-access journal) comes a set of general suggestions[5] on how to make the peer-review process in scientific publishing more reliable. Wicherts does a lot of research on this issue to try to reduce the number of dubious publications in his main discipline, the psychology of human intelligence.<p>&quot;With the emergence of online publishing, opportunities to maximize transparency of scientific research have grown considerably. However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=\"http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/the-data-detective-1.10937\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nature.com/news/the-data-detective-1.10937</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2160588\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2160588</a><p>(this abstract link leads to a free download of the article)<p>[4] <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1850704\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1850704</a><p>(this abstract link also leads to a free download of the full paper)<p>[5] <a href=\"http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational_Neuroscience/10.3389/fncom.2012.00020/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational_Neuroscience/10.338...</a><p>Jelte M.

6770954,comment,6769379,6770697,1,0,waps,,,"> It should be pretty obvious by now that capitalism is not sustainable in the long term, because it encourages, or even forces the ever growing consumption of natural resources and the increasing environmental destruction.<p>The same is true of the universe and evolution. Especially evolution has the exact same problem. In practice though :<p>1) 4.1 billion years and counting<p>2) it has overcome every obstacle either humanity or anything else has thrown at it (same can be said for capitalism, and the same cannot be said for any form of collectivism, unless you want to call organisations like Christianity collectivist, which they sort-of are. Christianity is a lot younger than capitalism though)<p>3) it is always using exponential growth and competition everywhere<p>> (And it will require a huge increase in energy use to recycle, which will probably come from more nuclear power as it is more Capitalist - renewable solutions can&#x27;t be monopolized.)<p>Aside from being &quot;more capitalist&quot; (?) nuclear power is also just plain &quot;more&quot;. Furthermore, I&#x27;d argue that nuclear power plants are much more communist. They&#x27;re the sort of thing where everything will be hammered down by regulation, including monopolies for the companies.<p>And the argument about which is more sustainable renewable or nuclear, is not settled. Due to oil-based production of renewable generators, for which renewable power provides no alternative at all, consumption of non-renewable resources is going up, not down.<p>> It&#x27;s hard to say whether socialism would work, because it hasn&#x27;t been properly tried yet. Whatever system we come up with to organize people, it needs to be based around sustainability rather than &quot;wealth creation&quot;.<p>No offence, but the last few attempts at socialism weren&#x27;t exactly environmentally friendly, or sustainable. Nor were they anywhere near equal. Why would this time be different ?",1384979570

I am quite far on the left, thanks. The violent actors that are attracted to just about any cause do not represent the cause, but they are an easy scapegoat to be used by the opposition, and this scapegoating <i>works</i>.<p>Short of changing human nature, this is the limitation we have to work with. Every violent act in the name of some cause directly works against said cause, even if its perpetrators are themselves a minority. A single violent actor in your midst cancels out the credibility of hundreds, if not thousands, of peaceful participants.<p>We can whine all day about how unfair this is, but tough, this is the way public perception works. This is why as supporters of whatever cause you believe in, it&#x27;s of critical importance to root out the violent elements within your group.<p>> <i>&quot;OWS are terrorists? Now I know you&#x27;re a shill. People should really take note of these type of subtle propoganda, and get informed.&quot;</i><p>Jesus, go back to /r/conspiracy already. Look at my posting history, you think I get paid to write this shit? This is what I hate about talking to people like you, I express one thing you find disagreeable, but no, I can&#x27;t possibly hold that opinion in good faith, I must be <i>paid</i>, I must be a planted agitator.<p>OWS aren&#x27;t terrorists, but their protests around the country (outside of NYC itself, which remained relatively peaceful) were mired with rioting, looting, and violence. It made the movement <i>completely toxic</i> to any support from political moderates. Over time it became largely associated with crackpots and extremists, and they never gained the support of the undecided everyman. OWS died <i>because</i> of its violent internal elements.<p>You think people didn&#x27;t identify with OWS? Nearly everyone I know identifies with the core complaints of OWS, but very few ever participated in their protests, because they were known to be violent, because nobody wanted to be in the same crowd as black bloc assholes smashing windows. There is a reason why MLK Jr. preached <i>heavily</i> for non-violence, because every window smashed, every store looted, erases the hard work of many, many more people.<p>> <i>&quot;During class warfare, your poor and disenfranchised are AT WAR with the rich and wealthy. Of course these people have no recourse for representation from the elite, nor do they have police protection.&quot;</i><p>Really? <i>Really?</i> That&#x27;s the best you can come up with, after bringing up single-payer health care in Canada? One of the greatest (if not <i>the</i> greatest) achievements in Canadian history? The one that was won without a single bullet or a single bomb? The one that was hard-fought by people in the political process, by shrewd leaders?<p><i>You</i> brought that up and now you&#x27;re saying that there is no recourse other than violence?

I imagine much of this is allocated towards C-level hires, and anyone else is getting the scraps. I&#x27;ve also heard (but not confirmed firsthand so take with a grain of salt) that VCs don&#x27;t like overly large employee stock pools. I have no clue why - VC stock is preferred and employee stock is common so it&#x27;s not they&#x27;re offering any competition. It might have something to do with founders getting discouraged by additional dilution, which in turn limits the kinds of deals that founder is willing to participate in.<p>2) Paying out more cash to engineers makes it more difficult for your company to achieve a positive (or break-even) EBITDA. Negative EBITDA makes you a much less attractive acquisition target unless you&#x27;re either trendy or have some ungodly large number of &quot;eyeballs&quot; that haven&#x27;t been monetized yet (They&#x27;re paying for the upside). An entrepreneur contemplating offering market-clearing salaries could talk themselves out of it by concluding &quot;I can probably just hire the same engineer for less if I just wait longer and work harder at screening&quot; -- effectively trading time to save money.

During class warfare, your poor and disenfranchised are AT WAR with the rich and wealthy. Of course these people have no recourse for representation from the elite, nor do they have police protection. After years of struggles with police and politicians, I find it insulting to claim that any engagements are terrorism, and that all of it is under the pretense of war. Just look at the locations of these events...<p>> Their only long-term effect was the further marginalization of the political left in the USA, as they became associated with violence.<p>Actually the labour movements had gotten the most concessions out of government between 1918 and 1940. If you disagree, again, feel free to explain how labour laws inhibit society from being truly free/prosperous.<p>> Terrorism gave us nothing except fear, violence, and death. In every place it has shown up it has actively worked against the causes it purports to advance (see: OWS and rioting).<p>OWS are terrorists? Now I know you&#x27;re a shill.

1. Too much pressure.  (even if it is not explicit, given her standing, it is implicit)
2. I don't know if she likes me for me, or just because her clock is ticking.<p>On the flip side, girls it have really really easy on their early 20s.  That might create an ""suply is infinite"" kind of thinking in girls, and maybe perhaps even a degree of narcisism sets in   (I am demanded, I deserver x, and y, and of course z qualities on a bf/ideal partner).   Some girls just fail to realise that past 26 (maybe 28 for asian girls), looks tend to fade.   (fertility peak is 22).<p>So, absent a family presure, it is easy to get comfortable thinking this attention they get is normal, and will last for a long time.<p>Hence, they hit their late 20s/early 30s with extremely high expectations, yet their perceived value has diminished with time  (at least looks wise).<p>Many girls realize this, and end up being in ""settling mode"",  which honestly, if you are a guy sucks.
She will not love you for what you really are.<p>To be honest if I had a daughter, my advice would be find a good one between 25-28.  That's where your should be wise enough to know what you want, but still have time to change your mind if you feel it is not the right thing.",1268267471

Assumptions like 'all TCP ports are open, all the time, between all servers', 'we can put things wherever we want in the filesystem', and 'the server should be configured just like my local workstation' make upgrades and deployment a nightmare, and are nominally difficult to change in a codebase with more than a few iterations underneath it.<p>Oh, and my other favorite pet peeves: Applications that provide no easy way to verify whether or not they are, in fact, up or down, and having debugging information dumped into the logs marked as errors, rather than as debug messages.<p>Keep in mind that these won't bite you in the ass initially, when you're only on a single server, or on a small, tightly controlled cluster of boxes.  They'll torpedo you when you need to scale up, and you'll get a second shot in the boilers if you ever need meet any number of regulatory standards for various industries (PCI, HIPAA, etc.).<p>Fixing these early-on is <i>easy</i>, and you can enforce scaling-and-deployment friendly coding practices through automated unit testing and CI.  Won't even really cost your coding team any extra time.  Fixing them down the road, after you've got a few thousand live customers and a big pile of codebase to dig around in, is... difficult, at best.",1268266948

If it fits you keep it, pay for it and everyone is happy. If not, you don't pay for it and toss it away what apparently Mozilla did. Same thing you do with photographs. You try many of them, but buy only the ones that go into final design. I wonder if MetaLab pays for all the photos that go through its designers hands.<p>There are some screenshot that prove that at some point that design was tried to be fitted. That's all.

Not to mention every variable being defined by what it looks like, no notion of scope, no syntactic sugar like for or while loops, and no notion of methods.

They modeled the new one (that was supposed to be web based) on the old one, and they decided to build it all in COBOL. I'm guessing they repurposed [1] some code, and they definitely repurposed the database. I think the goal was to have employees continue to use the command-line based task system while allowing customers to input tasks on the web. I think they also wanted employees outside the main office to still be able to access the task system if they were, say, at a client's office.<p>I left right around this whole project got started. I even mocked up the original interfaces. Twice. The first time I didn't do the whole thing in a table and my manager couldn't understand it, so I had to rip out any CSS and divs and go back to the 90's. They had two ""graphic designers"" on staff, so I'm not entirely sure why I was given that task, but there it is.<p>My whole time there seemed like some weird trip back in time. It took me a while to get used the copyright date on the COBOL compiler being two years before I was born.<p>[1]: ""Repurposed"" is used loosely.

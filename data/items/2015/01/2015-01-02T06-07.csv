John Harrison&#x27;s screed against worldbuilding as &quot;the great clomping foot of nerdism&quot; [1]) confirms that he&#x27;s basically trying to prove that a writing style he doesn&#x27;t like is, therefore, logically and objectively inferior to a style he does like. I&#x27;m comfortable that my first impression was accurate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080410181840/http://uzwi.wordpress.com/2007/01/27/very-afraid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20080410181840/http://uzwi.wordpr...</a>",1420181726

TLS is rarely supported, and not really ever used, so it&#x27;s not like sabotage is needed to make it viewable.<p>And a lot of this stuff is the result of carrying over design decisions, literally, from the 60s. Someone wrote an RFC codifying what they were doing by hand. And that nonsense gets passed forward for zero reason.<p>Ever wonder why HTTP uses the idiotic &quot;Thu, 28 Jan, 1998, GMT&quot; format for datetime? Because that format makes sense if you&#x27;re hand-reading email message headers. And HTTP just copied it forward, zero thinking involved. Probably the same reason you can have comments in headers. SIP gives an example:<p><pre><code>  Retry-After: 300 (I&#x27;m in a meeting)
</code></pre>
To real-world engineers, we say, wow, that&#x27;s idiotic. Comments will never be used, so they&#x27;ll never be properly implemented and only serve to make things problematic.<p>To an IETF RFC author, that kind of behaviour is &quot;well RFC xxx does it that way&quot;, and ultimately comes to &quot;well, like, if you were sending HTTP messages by fax, extra comments might help&quot;.<p>If you stack up enough hacks like that, then it starts to become the clusterfuck it is. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any maliciousness involved. Just lack of critical thinking, or lack of experience actually implementing software.

(There&#x27;s also the technical observation that CCSS is not the only way to achieve those underlying aspirational goals. I see that Minnesota has decided to not use CCSS, and assume a Minnesota parent may oppose CCSS for the honest belief that the Minnesota standards are better for a 21st century life than CCSS.)<p>I brought up &quot;classical educated citizen&quot; precisely because it is a different mythos. The essay only concerns itself with one specific goal - train the workers of the top 500 companies of the 21st century. There are dozens of often opposing goals for the education system[1], and to focus on only one is a disservice. You suggest I should read some education theory, but omit that the essay author is equally lacking; which was my point.<p>But since you bring up education theory, and elites, I feel it&#x27;s useful to point out your own strawmen. We&#x27;ve long had multiple education methods in American schools. See <a href=""http://cuip.uchicago.edu/~cac/nlu/fnd504/anyon.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cuip.uchicago.edu/~cac/nlu/fnd504/anyon.htm</a> from the 1980s, on &quot;Social Class and the Hidden Curriculum of Work&quot;. It points out that:<p>- &quot;In the two working-class schools, work is following the steps of a procedure. The procedure is usually mechanical, involving rote behavior and very little decision making or choice&quot;<p>- &quot;In the middle-class school, work is getting the right answer. If one accumulates enough right answers, one gets a good grade. One must follow the directions in order to get the right answers, but the directions often call for some figuring, some choice, some decision making.&quot;<p>- &quot;In the affluent professional school, work is creative activity carried out independently. The students are continually asked to express and apply ideas and concepts. Work involves individual thought and expressiveness, expansion and illustration of ideas, and choice of appropriate method and material.&quot;<p>- &quot;In the executive elite school, work is developing one&#x27;s analytical intellectual powers. Children are continually asked to reason through a problem, to produce intellectual products that are both logically sound and of top academic quality. A primary goal of thought is to conceptualize rules by which elements may fit together in systems and then to apply these rules in solving a problem. Schoolwork helps one to achieve, to excel, to prepare for life.&quot;<p>To simply say that the options are &quot;inquiry based learning&quot; as compared to some sort of &quot;info-dump lectures and memorizing algorithms without context&quot; is ahistorical. It&#x27;s like saying that before agile there was only waterfall.<p>You say my argument is &quot;that all children should be part of a liberal elite. Which is not a bad argument, but is not one, at its core, of education.&quot;<p>I find that odd because, sociologically speaking, your statement is that all children should be part of the middle class or the professional class. Consider this quote from <a href=""http://www.academia.edu/2976656/Social_class_and_social_action_The_middle-class_bias_of_democratic_theory_in_education"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.academia.edu/2976656/Social_class_and_social_acti...</a> :<p>> collaboration and teamwork have become increasingly central characteristics of middle-class life over the 20th century. Group success often requires managers and professionals to work closely with people they have no long-term relationship with. Each individual in these contexts is expected to independently contribute his or her own particular knowledge and skills to an often weakly defined common project. Collaboration in these groups is facilitated by the relatively abstract, elaborated discourse predominant in middle-class settings (Bernstein, 1971; Brown, 1995; Gee et al., 1996; von Trotha & Brown, 1982). For the rest of the article, I refer to this particularly middle-class form of joint action as discursive collaboration<p>Collaboration (&quot;teamwork&quot;) is a middle-class value and has been for decades. Why is promoting a middle-class value &quot;at its core&quot; part of education, where so-called &quot;liberal elite&quot; goals are not?<p>Fussell back in 1983 in &quot;Class: A Guide Through the American Status System&quot; also pointed out that teamwork was part of the middle class. I can&#x27;t find a direct reference online, though I found this summary: &quot;Corporations hire [the middle class] from second-tier colleges and teach them that being a team player is the most important thing they can be.&quot; - <a href=""https://danielmiessler.com/study/class/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://danielmiessler.com/study/class/</a><p>A push for teamwork was solidly part of middle class consciousness already by the 1980s, and likely much earlier. Part of my &#x27;baloney&#x27; is to reject as propaganda that idea that it&#x27;s some new 21st century ideal.<p>[1] I would love a school system which educates more about the Participatory Citizen and

This strong correlation allowed them to rule out outside influence (not just lifestyle, also genetics and other environmental factors) as being statistically significant to the incidence of those cancers. Only a couple cancers (the article specifically notes lung cancer and certain skin cancers), had statistically significant deviations from what the rate of division would suggest.<p>The chart at the top is a bit disingenuous - you can&#x27;t really say that those cancers are &quot;caused&quot; by outside influences, but it does indicate that they actually play a role in a statistically significant number of cases, as opposed to the other cancers, which are due largely to random chance (if the study&#x27;s results are correct). There are probably still a large number of lung cancer cases, for example, caused by bad luck.<p>Regardless of the conclusions regarding the environmentally influenced cancers, the impact on our understanding of other cancers, which include very common and deadly ones such as pancreatic and colon cancer, is still immense and important.<p>Disclaimer: IANA doctor or statistician",1420179405

We don&#x27;t stiffle expression. (Unlike those other countries out there...)&quot;. So doing anything too harsh to a public figure, known internationally, is going to create a big hassle.<p>At another level you can argue that he is also a token, and thus implicitly somehow part of the system.  He is a representative example of how &quot;tollerant and open&quot; the country is. &quot;Hey look, a harsh critic of the system is still alive and still working&quot;.  So it is important to keep him around but tighten the screw periodically a bit so he stays in check, so to speak.<p>On the topic of the article. I think the interesting part is how Ai tried to manage the surveilance and how he responded to it. Installing cameras around and basically making his life completely public, for everyone. At some level that mocked and maybe emasculated the watchers. Monitoring, is a power play of course too. This mocking was probably rather infuriating for them. &quot;Oh you want to monitor me, fine I&#x27;ll monitor myself 10x better than you and will let everyone participate&quot;.<p>But also this is also possible because he is already a public figure. His public image is the only thing that shields and protects him and allows him to do this. He knows it of course.<p>The other example, is him approaching the undercover officers watching him.  Also a great way to mock and in way difuse their power.<p>Extrapolating to how we (in US) are watched and monitored by Apple, Google, NSA, not sure how and what can be learned here. The difference that it is rather impersonal and mocking doesn&#x27;t work in the same way. You know people insert signatures with [al-Qaeda, bomb, president, blah blah] in their emails.

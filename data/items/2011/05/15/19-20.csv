In fact the only difference between them is what you do with the information AFTER hacking into a system.<p>Even if you deduce that there might be a flaw in some web site design, you actually need to illegally hack the site in order to prove such flaw exists. In the article, the author noticed he could associate himself with any company that works with the US government and change their info. To prove that, he broke the law. And is lucky he is not in jail for doing so.<p>I can see from the company's point of view, from the FBI, from the government, from senators and congressmen writing the laws - trying to find flaws in a system is by definition hacking, illegal entry, unauthorized use. You don't have to be stealing credit card numbers for it to be a crime. Logging in to a computer system you are not authorized to is a crime. Period.<p>So the moral of the story is, if you want to stay out of jail, don't try to find flaws in web sites. Just don't. Or if you do, have a theory and report it to the company, but don't test your theory.<p>But I do agree companies should have a way to be contacted about security flaws, and be held criminally liable if a flaw was reported and not fixed in a timely manner.

Needs a better 'when' operator."").<p>It sounds like Ryan is saying that he re-wrote it because of technical reasons, when from the email exchange, it is really because of licensing. That's kind of sketchy to me.<p>Right or wrong, I think that if node was using mongrel/nginx stuff at any point they should still give some attribution. It certainly seems like the code was helpful in getting the project started regardless of the fact that all the code has been rewritten in later releases.",1305486249

It seems to be an enormous waste of time so I usually schedule an alarm after 8 hours.<p>It never occurred to me that one can measure whether the amount of sleep received is right. I just downloaded PEBL (<a href=""http://pebl.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pebl.sourceforge.net/</a>), an open source software that includes the P.V.T. test (mentioned in the article) in its battery -- an you can adjust lots of test parameters simply by editing ppbt.pbl. Seems to be working fine (though the test itself is boring and tedious). I'll measure few times a day and try whether 8 vs 10 hours makes a difference in my case.",1305486196

E.g., try adding an index to a non-trivially sized table in MySQL and see how fast that (unnecessary) SELECT performs.<p>We're a postgres shop and the problem we've run into lately is just the sheer number of open connections to the DB.  Using something like PgBouncer helps tremendously, but it still is contingent on there being idle connections.  Certainly read slaves could be thrown at the problem, too.

396771,comment,396435,396711,0,0,lincolnq,,,"I've read Simon Peyton Jones's Beautiful Code excerpt (<a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1964"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1964</a> for those who need it), and it's very nice.<p>I would be interested in the ""too much overhead"" article -- can you track it down? I've been researching STM for a while and seen a lot of papers focused on performance and such, so I'd be surprised if whatever the article claims are the problems are not fixable in the long term.<p>(STM can be nearly reduced to ""taking locks"", especially if you are compiling, so it really shouldn't be worse than lock-based synchronization, and it's much easier to reason about.)",1229187262

396768,comment,395614,395962,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Yes that's the dogma. Alas, it's completely lost on me. I fail to understand how tables are more ""semantic"" than nested divs. Tables only have semantics within the context of some formalism that defines their semantic meaning. Outside of such a context they can be anything, so why not a way of laying out information on a page?<p>I don't see how swaths of divs, some of them used for semantics (according to some metadata standard), some of them used for purely presentational purposes, improve anything.<p>CSS people (or should I say modern web developers) are completely anal about not using tables for layout whilst at the same time the whole notion of document structure is so utterly destroyed in any JavaScript heavy app.<p>These priorities make no sense to me. Laying out web pages with divs and CSS is a black art. It's fragile. It breaks in all kinds of nasty ways. It reduces the productivity of UI development to pre 90s levels and leads ot entire pages done in Flash.",1229187004
396767,comment,396435,396435,0,0,lincolnq,,,"I understand why some people want sequential semantics in parallel programs: it's very easy to reason about, especially for those who are used to sequential reasoning (like most imperative programmers). Certainly, if your goal is to use parallelism to speed up your existing software (and this is, indeed, Cilk's goal) then it makes lots of sense.<p>But most software programs can accept a little nondeterminism. Object-oriented design (at least, GOOD design) is built around the fact that your object's methods might be called at any time; you're just providing an interface. So (this was a programming language idea I was working on for a while) why don't we make it work that way? Make all method calls asynchronous, make methods transactions upon objects, and just schedule as many method calls in parallel as you can get your hands on. Good for server design, potentially good for parallelizing existing code (you'd still have to go through it and make sure it made sense -- no reaching into other people's objects and tweaking their internal state, etc.)<p>I guess my point is that while serial equivalence is a strong property, it's not necessary for many programs, and it completely prevents the existence of some, especially server-type programs.",1229186982

396765,comment,396245,396425,0,0,retyred,,,"absolutely. i was a programmer at yahoo for almost thirteen years and was laid off. i'm not worried about finding work again, but since i have a nestegg i think i will sit things out for a year or so since job reqs will likely be featuring lower salaries. this makes sense, if i was a hiring employer in a valley of perpetually overextended, consumption obsessed workers, i wouldn't offer top dollar either. people will be taking what they can get to pay their bills.",1229186923
396764,comment,396435,396711,0,0,jerf,,,"I've been waiting for a Haskell response to that STM article, because the STM article didn't pay any attention to Haskell at all. One criticism of the article fails in Haskell entirely (in Haskell, you don't get the problem of IO repeating if the transaction repeats, because you can't have IO in transactions (barring cheating)). I'd like to hear how their performance compares, and if it does have a lot of overhead, whether they think it'll ever come out.<p>The fact that there wasn't one leads me to believe that they are susceptible to the same problems and have no hope of getting around it in the future, though; I suspect if that wasn't true, dons would have been all over the comments on proggit, and he was silent. It's thin logic, admittedly, but...",1229186847

396761,comment,395614,396078,0,0,jerf,,,"Oh! So <i>that's</i> why Google is developing a speedy JS interpreter... they want to be able to see JS-based pages! They can load a page into a browser-with-no-graphics, and give the JS a certain amount of time to run before freezing the page and then reading off the DOM nodes instead of reading HTML. If they don't like the results, they can just use the HTML like they used to.<p>(Reading off the DOM nodes also gives them a fresh crack at some more semantic analysis that used to be really hard, since it involved emulating a browser... did you use <span class=""some_header""> instead of <h1>? They can make a better heuristic guess at that if they are ""inside"" a browser and thus capable of seeing that the size is twenty points higher than the surrounding text, no matter how you implemented that.)<p>To really pull this off, you need a browser engine that enough people are using that site designers need to account for it, and it needs to be designed with the goal of running just the engine as quickly as possible on the backend, with the ability to cut it off after a certain amount of time.<p>So... has anybody dug deeply enough into Chrome to have an opinion on the feasibility of running the browser without a UI?",1229186457

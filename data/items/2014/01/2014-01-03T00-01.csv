What if it is about making an impact upon the world? About creating products that touch millions of lives, about doing our small part to make the world a better place?<p>Then again I&#x27;m not good at vacations. I don&#x27;t switch off well, I&#x27;m the guy reading a book or playing a game while watching TV. Heck at times I&#x27;ll play two video games at once, or play a game while reading an article. A two second pause in action in one game is plenty of time to alt tab out, read half a sentence, and alt-tab back in.<p>Heck two seconds feels like an eternity at times!<p>> Ideally, my dream job is to just work for myself (I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s everyone else&#x27;s too).<p>Nope, although a good profit sharing plan would be appreciated! I love working within a team of people, we can get a lot more done together than as individuals!",1388710761

7003578,comment,7003099,7003381,6,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> I take issue with this new generation of developers who seem to have no moral or ethical boundaries on the invasion of privacy.<p>I do too, but I&#x27;m beginning to become convinced that most people really don&#x27;t care and really aren&#x27;t bothered by it.<p>We&#x27;ve had numerous clients -- maybe most of them -- request or expect us to keep track of the passwords for their online accounts for them. Privacy erosions and violations by various businesses really haven&#x27;t been that big of a deal outside of tech circles. Just an hour or so ago, while on an errand, an NPR guest was mentioning something similar, that her Facebook account had been compromised but it didn&#x27;t change the way she used the service. It wasn&#x27;t really anything more than a temporary inconvenience for her.<p>Earlier today, a client&#x27;s personal Hotmail account was compromised. It was being used to spam people on his contacts list. We got in touch with him to give him the heads-up on it. His response was, &quot;it&#x27;s not a big deal, I don&#x27;t really care about that, I&#x27;m not even going to change the password on it.&quot;<p>We had one business client that supposedly took security very seriously. Government funded and all that. They would routinely ask us to put new procedures and safeguards in place, only to then turn around and immediately try to work around them for convenience&#x27;s sake.<p>This has been a tough thing to accept, but I really don&#x27;t believe any more that most people care at all about privacy or security. What they mostly want is convenience.<p>And SnapChat is very convenient.",1388710713

7003576,comment,6999429,7002923,1,0,ACow_Adonis,,,"Lets break down the role of interviews into two parts.  The first part: To ensure the candidate is sufficiently-socialised and isn&#x27;t a dangerous toxic mouth-breather.  For this, current interviews can work relatively well.  An hour or so, face to face, just talking back and forth mulling over problems/theory with an authority in the field or people they&#x27;re working with.<p>I am genuinely skeptical about whether people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about can actually hide that fact \nfrom people who do know what they&#x27;re talking about in such a situation.  The secret of course is to basically ignore qualifications/status and do it as a conversation.  Perhaps in such a scenario, five minutes in me and the original poster would be getting onto ridiculous questions of trading/probability with great big smiles on our faces and forgetting all about whether one can remember bayes off the top of their head.<p>The second part:  Assessing the technical ability of the candidate at hand.  And for this I think current interview culture is horribly toxic.<p>I do not work for Facebook, nor do I believe that such techniques are not without their flaws, and are difficult/expensive to implement, but I think techniques aimed at &quot;actually get the candidate to do the task involved in the job, and see how they go&quot; has merit.  Forget your preconceptions about what is required. Give them a real world task you&#x27;d expect them to do in the job, the time it would be expected of someone in the job.  The resources of the job.  See how they go.: See <a href""http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extractio"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extr...</a> for example.<p>Not perfect, but better than 5 minute &quot;interviewer questions of the year&quot;.<p>Funnily enough, I got into my current organisation answering questions in the interview on analyzing health statistics. Something I knew nothing about.  A senior executive then snatched/let me move across to his area in the more technical side of things without a subsequent interview after I made it known I&#x27;d be interested, and after working with their guys for a bit on another project.

It&#x27;s true that there is a new <i>additional</i> individual mandate that falls on people who <i>both</i> have a certain minimum income level <i>and</i> do not have employer-provide health insurance, but the existing incentives that tie health insurance to employers remain and new mandates that encourage employer-tied health insurance exist.<p>> It&#x27;s not as sensible a system as single payer, but it&#x27;s a big step toward making people less dependent on their boss for their health.<p>This is true insofar that the exchanges by existing, the larger risk pools for individual insurance purchases, and the subsidies for low-to-moderate income workers (and the Medicaid expansion for lower incomes) make it less likely that you will end up with <i>no</i> insurance that you can afford if you lose your job, it doesn&#x27;t do much to make it any less likely that you won&#x27;t be financially able to retain your <i>existing</i> insurance (and access to the particular provider network it has) if you lose your job.",1388710482

Our private ones cost almost $50k per year. It&#x27;s also competitive enough to get into the top universities that the game increasingly starts in high school or before; in New York, it&#x27;s very typical for merely middle-class parents to hawk up $30k per kid per year from ages 4 to 18: admissions are <i>that</i> competitive.<p>Health insurance is another nightmare. Decent plans cost $500 per month for an individual in a employer-provided plan (and, increasingly, &quot;employee contribution&quot; of 25-100% is the norm). If you&#x27;re on the individual market, you&#x27;re fucked: it&#x27;s closer to $1500 per month if you&#x27;re healthy and have no children.<p>Then there is housing. You can actually get a good deal (say, $150 per ft^2) in wide swathes of the country-- but those are in places with imploded job markets. To buy anywhere with an active job market is pretty much unaffordable on the typical software engineer salary, and even rents will typically be 20 to 40% of after-tax income.<p>Europe has a lot of issues and extended liabilities, but the U.S. is far more fucked in the coming decade. I&#x27;d gladly pay $7/gallon for gas not to have to worry about healthcare (even if you have insurance, it will often fail you at the worst time) or, in the future should I have kids, education costs.",1388710467

(by which i mean, in real world interviews.  I&#x27;m not commenting on the specific poster).<p>2) I am not saying that I couldn&#x27;t do the question, per se.<p>On the contrary, my professional work shows not only that I can do the question, but that I&#x27;ve probably done it innumerable times and to the standard of (and sometimes greater than) other professionals.<p>The subtext of my response to the bond question shows that, in an absolute juvenile sense, I &quot;know&quot; the answer that&#x27;s being looked for because I&#x27;ve notionally been trained as en economist.  Which is to say, I am aware of the rote learned current models/theory.<p>I&#x27;m saying that I probably couldn&#x27;t answer it in the interview environment in the way that most interviewers would deem &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;right&quot;.<p>Why? Because I both haven&#x27;t memorized Bayes theorem, and wouldn&#x27;t accept there as being a simple probabilistic interpretation applicable to real world problems.  Now its true, I could probably attempt to re-derive it there in the interview from some even more basic understandings of probability, but is that what interviewers want?  I&#x27;d almost certainly offer the answer of &quot;Can i look at the two sides of the coin?&quot; or &quot;the probability is either 0 or 1&quot;.  And then we&#x27;d go down the path of probability interpretations, and then only after they made it clear that they wanted a Bayesian approach, we could start heading in that direction.  Is that what they&#x27;re looking for?  I don&#x27;t think it is.  But they are all valid responses.<p>I think they want someone who has remembered Bayes and its application recently and then just applied it.  I think in the bond question, they want someone who has rote learnt some economic/finance theory.  And I think the worst aspect is that the stronger candidate, who pauses, who thinks, who questions, and who doesn&#x27;t just go down the regurgitated answer will probably, in real life, be marked as the weaker candidate.<p>And I&#x27;m also saying this as someone who is already employed, being paid and and working professionally on things the questions are supposed to be screening for.  So while the original poster is in a position of authority to speak of such things, so am I.<p>Are you familiar with Project Euler?  I&#x27;ve completed many of those problems as well, but I would never expect myself or some other candidate to be able to do them spontaneously in said interview, or think worse of them if they couldn&#x27;t.  And if they could do them, I don&#x27;t think that would be an indicator of very much more than the fact that they happened to be working on said problem recently, had just taken a course on said problem, or had just been doing interview questions for my field.",1388709570

As long as loans are available and assistance is not, universities (most of which are public) will not have incentive to offer affordable educations.

There are 10^10 possible phone numbers (without country code), so approx 34 bits of information to encode the entire phone number space.<p>If your API accepts a 128-bit hash (pick your favorite) of a phone number and returns the user&#x27;s username, and is rate-limited, it would be infeasible to brute force the hashed phone number space to produce the data dump. Then, rate limit by account (rather than IP address) and flag accounts accessing this API too frequently or in different patterns than your client uses.",1388708314

Most people accept them - they feel like they have to. I&#x27;ve done it quite a few times.<p>But what we really need is more self-realization like this at the top. This is where the change for these sorts of policies can happen. On one hand, it&#x27;s really sad that we&#x27;re so work obsessed here - money is more important than people so much of the time. But, on the other hand, there is still room and freedom to make your own way and write your own rules.<p>I think about this topic a lot, especially because I am fighting burnout myself. I didn&#x27;t do any work for most of xmas break and when I went back this week I kept thinking &quot;I need another few months off&quot;. I even had to push for the two days after xmas off - there was a little push back from the ceo since we&#x27;re a small 4 person company. But, I&#x27;m a little older than everyone and I was thinking &quot;fuck it, I need to chill&quot;.<p>Ideally, my dream job is to just work for myself (I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s everyone else&#x27;s too). Sure, there are tradeoffs with that, but there&#x27;s something about working when you want, where you want. I think there can definitely be a balance between being on vacation a lot and outsourcing all the non-important work to other people who will do it. Time Ferris is a great read for this type of living and it exemplifies the work to live not live to work thing (or work as little as possible and <i>really live</i>).<p>I did a vacation a few years ago where my wife and mother in-law went to Spain. It was awesome, my first time there, but I was &#x27;pressured&#x27; by work to keep crankin on our app. It was such bullshit and I was really pissed about that pressure - vacation was not vacation. I told myself: 1) I&#x27;d never work for someone else on vaca again - ever, and 2) I&#x27;d never make anyone else do that. Needless to say after a few days I was like, &#x27;fuck this, this is the stupidest thing in the world. I&#x27;m in one of the best food and historical places in the world and the guys at home want me to keep coding. Bullshit.&#x27;<p>I think there&#x27;s a point where you either keep going with everyone else&#x27;s rules or you make your own. Get busy livin or get busy dyin. I&#x27;m at the point in my life where I&#x27;m getting to the last of dyin for someone else&#x27;s deal and starting to live for my own. It&#x27;s not impossible, just take discipline and focus. Otherwise, me, and everyone else is working under someone else&#x27;s thumb, by their rules, working on vacation. Dumb.",1388708272

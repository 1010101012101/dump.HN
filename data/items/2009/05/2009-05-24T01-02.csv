I was skeptical when it opened with the perfunctory Terminator reference, and it didn't fail to disappoint.<p>The MSM's conflation of actually existent AI (search, learning, etc.) with AGI is becoming a real pet peeve of mine.",1243129662
624024,comment,623401,623835,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"They wanted to become the ""Youtube for documents"" and they did. Nobody that I know of has a better docstorage method, and, like Youtube, Scribd feels cheap and often gives me results that lied about what they were to get views. I'm not mad at Scribd for doing that, since it worked, but I have to wonder who would willingly demean his life's work for the sake of popularity. Perhaps that's just my pretension speaking.",1243129400

624021,comment,623401,623920,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"Persecution doesn't necessarily mean a lawsuit, when it's an instantly verifiable claim. If everybody is doing it, then it's a matter of finding and reporting those people, and either having it removed or pressing charges against the criminals involved. (Once it reaches that point, a lot of people will find ways to stop ripping off writers. I hope it doesn't reach that point any time soon.",1243129196

624017,comment,623087,623171,0,0,steve_mobs,,,"you are right in marketing its called selective retention and attention. In terms of beliefs people will only pay attention to and remember things that support their current beliefs and values. Most people are like this.

I think it's best to wait-and-see on this one.<p>Perhaps Techcrunch and Last.fm are ""both"" right from their perspectives, and we're seeing a confusing mess?  Time will tell...<p>For now, I think Techcrunch should name their source publicly.  Or, if that source is worried the exposure will do them harm, have a neutral 3rd party verify the source's credibility while keeping their confidentiality.  Is this a current or former employee?  How high-up are they in Last.fm/CBS?  How long have they worked there?  Are they a current or former employee?  etc etc...<p>Last.fm's trust is potentially on the line here.  Techcrunch's integrity as journalists is potentially on the line here as well.",1243128367

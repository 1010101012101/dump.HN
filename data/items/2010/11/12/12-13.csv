Clojure has been coming on strong lately.<p>>Afaik, you don't get language extensions like a new OO system in Java...?<p>You're running into a ""good is the enemy of the great"" issue here.  Perl probably has Moose because the ""OO"" it comes with it is awful.  Java actually has a pretty workable OO system right out of the box, so no one is willing to go to the trouble to put something even better on when they could just write more code with what they have.  I'll give you that modifying the language is easier in perl if you need to.<p>>So after comparing with CL for flexibility -- you compare amount of libraries with a system language, with roughly half the development speed (and a lot more pain) compared to scripting languages and Lisp...?<p>The point of that example was purely to counter the oft claimed ""CPAN has more libraries than any other language!"".  It's not true, though the libraries it has might be easier to find than some.<p>>Oh, please... that was irrelevant bashing.<p>I just get tired of hearing about Larry's supposed linguist credentials.

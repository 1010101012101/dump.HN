It&#x27;s not about &quot;are we powerful enough&quot; or &quot;are we big enough&quot; it&#x27;s not about size or power.<p>Even very small insignificant things can and do have quite a large impact. It&#x27;s more about impacting a system in a way it&#x27;s ill equipped to compensate for.<p>One of the more recent theories of the cause of the worst extinction level event is a particular methane producing microbe. Something far less powerful than a human is, yet a potential cause of an extinction level event that dwarfed the one that killed off the dinosaurs.",1434797919

It&#x27;s easy for healthy, happy, relatively wealthy people to say that we should cut emissions (cf. DiCaprio).  But reality is that, if those people practiced what they preach, they&#x27;d be living in log cabins--without solar panels.<p>And I certainly take issue with your vegetarian example.  What other people eat is none of your business.  It sounds almost funny, but that would be food fascism--is there any other word for it?  Do you really want some bureaucrat sitting behind a desk writing memos telling you what you are and are not allowed to eat?  How can you think that&#x27;s a good idea?  The more governments try to control people, the more people are harmed.  Doesn&#x27;t history make this obvious?

9749628,comment,9749284,9749554,0,0,Udo,,,"<i>> Sure it&#x27;s a mix, but it seems predominantly left to me. I may be wrong, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to prove it either way.</i><p>Personally, I think opinions that match ideologies you&#x27;re really opposed to probably leave a bigger impression than the ones you agree with. It&#x27;s easy to come to the conclusion that you&#x27;re in the minority when you&#x27;re really not. I believe there are a lot of social conservatives on HN, but the same people are not necessarily technologically or scientifically conservative. This doesn&#x27;t fall cleanly into left and right by US standards, but I think it&#x27;s a reasonable model of HN majority predisposition.<p><i>> No, you&#x27;re (probably unintentionally) misrepresenting my point.</i><p>I thought I was taking it as literally as possible, and after reading the response I still believe I understood the core intent correctly. When you said &quot;<i>But now, when it supposedly happens for a sixth time, it&#x27;s our fault.</i>&quot;, I got the impression that you&#x27;re asserting the only reason why we correlate extinctions with human activity is because we <i>want</i> to blame humans.<p>However, what&#x27;s actually going on is more a collection of thousands of observations about these events, made on a case by case basis. For example, these are observations about human settlements impacting wildlife. In another area, they might be data about the results of us restructuring local flora and fauna. Or they might be analytical results pointing to correlations between human-induced contamination of water bodies and changes in the biome that characteristically follow it. It&#x27;s literally a mass of thousands of data points.<p><i>> I disagree--evil is involved, at small and large scales. [...] they are not seeking the truth, but sticking with lies, which is evil.</i><p>You did originally use the word evil in an entirely different context, which I was responding to.<p><i>> And AGW/climate-change is a powerful vehicle to effect policy change for those in power to preserve and increase their power.</i><p>A lot of groups are proclaiming that the opposing organizations have money and power on their side. The environmental protection movement makes the same assertion, only about letting industry and agriculture go unchecked.<p>But let&#x27;s move away from political formulas now. The reality of the fact is that it actually matters very little whether and how often the Anthropocene is publicly declared. We&#x27;re going to continue on the path we&#x27;re already on. There will be some continued wide-scale destruction, and a lot of it will not be happening in western countries. But we&#x27;ll also ramp up initiatives to try and lessen our environmental impact, both to preserve biodiversity for its own sake, but also to improve our own quality of life.<p>You say that you believe any such efforts will harm people, but to be honest I find that line of reasoning difficult to follow, especially considering the fact that we&#x27;re mortally dependent on the integrity of our biosphere and that the measures we&#x27;re putting in place are generally very modest.<p>None of this will change because some scientists make sensationalistic claims in the media. The article we&#x27;re talking about is a total yawner, to be honest. Most scientific people already know we&#x27;re witnessing a huge extinction event, no matter how we actually label it. Talking about that label is the least interesting thing we can do with the observations we made.",1434797547

Being scientifically literate is not necessarily a left wing trait (however, I do make this assertion as a foreign outsider looking in, so I could be wrong).<p>Sure it&#x27;s a mix, but it seems predominantly left to me.  I may be wrong, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to prove it either way.<p>How are my statements about extinction objectively wrong?<p>> Mass extinctions happen for different reasons. What you&#x27;re saying is tantamount to: &quot;well, it was a cataclysmic volcano ice age that got us last time, so this asteroid could not possibly be dangerous.&quot;<p>No, you&#x27;re (probably unintentionally) misrepresenting my point.  It would be closer to, &quot;We have no idea whether that asteroid is going to come anywhere near us, and even if it were, it&#x27;s highly unlikely we could do anything to stop it.  However, devoting enough resources to mount a significant attempt to stop it would definitely harm people.  So we shouldn&#x27;t start doing that until it&#x27;s much clearer that 1) it&#x27;s going to hit us, and 2) we could stop it.&quot;<p>> It&#x27;s not about evil. We&#x27;re transforming the planet, yes, and it&#x27;s important to be mindful about it, but nobody except a very small fringe is advocating human extinction to rescue species. Instead, what we&#x27;re realistically doing is gathering data on how we&#x27;re impacting biodiversity, and how we can minimize that impact in the future. This is going to be a gradual process, but we&#x27;ve been moving in that direction for a long time and will likely continue to do so.<p>I disagree--evil is involved, at small and large scales.  At smaller scales, people are unwilling to admit certain possibilities, because doing so would harm their careers--they are not seeking the truth, but sticking with lies, which is evil.  On a larger scale, certain people want to control other people for their own gain, both in power and fortune.  That is also evil.<p>And AGW/climate-change is a powerful vehicle to effect policy change for those in power to preserve and increase their power.  CC was promoted as such a policy vehicle back in the 70s, and it&#x27;s still being used for it today.  Very little of the &quot;science&quot; is about actual facts--most of it is about politics.<p>This undermines the search for the truth.  But people who don&#x27;t recognize this accept the &quot;data&quot; at face value.  Then they advocate trying to stop climate change.  But doing that would line the pockets of certain powerful, wealthy people and corporations.  And it would keep certain parties and nations in positions of weakness.  This is why it is ultimately about evil.  If all that was being done was &quot;gathering data,&quot; that would be fine.",1434795326

This is a good thing and could make a lot of difference. But for an individual that wants to give, you don&#x27;t necessarily need it. You just need to find <i>a</i> destination for your donation. Try to understand that single organisation.<p>I like the idea of simple things where the money = thing equation is understandable. For example, I have a distant cousin in the Philippines who builds &quot;houses&quot; for squatters with arrangements with land owners. It started after the storm. He lives locally and understands building. It&#x27;s about £400 per hut. Most of the cost is labour. Materials are largely donated. The crew are locals that he knows. The recipients are living rough otherwise.<p>This may not scale to millions, but it works for individual donations. IE, you can find a charity that has the capacity to take your donation. Understand what they do and make an effective choice. It&#x27;s a much easier problem to solve than the &quot;how to make global donations more effective&quot; problem and is really the problem at hand when <i>you</i> make a choice.<p>Also..<p><i>Why was I doing it? Maybe the donation was the equivalent of an agnostic’s prayer, on the off-chance the supernatural listens to altruism.</i><p>I like that. I&#x27;d apply an atheist version for myself.

Is a billion butterflies also a &quot;small thing&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s not a question of fallacy--it&#x27;s a question of judgment.  Are humans &quot;big enough&quot; to have such a big effect on nature as a whole?  This is the question that we have yet to answer for certain.  Many people assume that we are more powerful than we have proven to be.<p>There is a fallacy, though: that of confusing correlation for causation.

But now, when it supposedly happens for a sixth time, it&#x27;s our fault.</i><p>Mass extinctions happen for different reasons. What you&#x27;re saying is tantamount to: &quot;well, it was a cataclysmic volcano ice age that got us last time, so this asteroid could not <i>possibly</i> be dangerous.&quot;<p><i>> All these evil humans, farming and logging and settling, destroying all the other species. If only the humans would go away, then the other species could live in peace.</i><p>It&#x27;s not about evil. We&#x27;re transforming the planet, yes, and it&#x27;s important to be mindful about it, but nobody except a very small fringe is advocating human extinction to rescue species. Instead, what we&#x27;re realistically doing is gathering data on <i>how</i> we&#x27;re impacting biodiversity, and how we can minimize that impact in the future. This is going to be a gradual process, but we&#x27;ve been moving in that direction for a long time and will likely continue to do so.<p><i>> Of course HN is predominantly left-leaning, so here come the downvotes</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true or fair, HN is a mix really. The problem is that your statements about extinction are objectively wrong. Being scientifically literate is not a left wing trait (however, I do make this assertion as a foreign outsider looking in, so I could be wrong).",1434794527

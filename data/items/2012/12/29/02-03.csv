What do you understand it's roots are, and how it works? What do you think your responsibility is, as a man, and as a member of this community?<p>You know what? I don't think I've ever personally witnessed a woman in tech being subjected to sexist behavior. And I know exactly why that is. It's because I so rarely encounter a woman in tech. They're like unicorns. And so we treat them like unicorns, because we, men, are having a new experience. Lo, a woman has entered into our mancave, let us attempt to impress her with our alpha geek abilities. But for them, that must be the experience they have continuously -- they are perpetually in the presence of a woman because they are one, so the novelty of that wore off a long time ago and now they're just constantly surrounded by men who act as though they've spotted a fantastical creature and are suddenly anxious to capitalize on this rare opportunity to try to mate with it.<p>I don't know how to fix that. A woman who knows what data locality optimization means is <i>rare</i>. And it's dangerous to be rare. It's difficult. You don't have safety in numbers. You don't have the benefit of the experience of many others like you. You don't have a strong voice because you don't have a strong population of similarly situated individuals.<p>So if I had a prescription for fixing it, it would be to make it not rare. We need a thousand million new women in tech. Easier said than done, right? But that's what we need. Chicken and egg. We drive all the women out by making them feel awkward and vulnerable, and then there are not enough women to move the needle on the treatment of women.<p>So women in tech to use a popular phrase, a market segment in serious need of disruption.<p>We need to make it cool to be a unicorn.  When we encounter such rare creatures we must make ""respect"" rather than ""capture"" to be the default response.<p>Which I know is hard. It goes against our nature. ""New toy"" and ""human being"" are not equivalent but are far too easily confused, and the fact is, most of the time we don't even realize we're doing it. And a lot of us are going to fail a lot of the time, but we still need to try.<p>And we're still going to fail even when we're trying. Which is why I say to those women who have bothered to read this far into my nonsense: Don't give up! Please don't give up. Because we -- men -- need strong female role models. We need to encounter women we can respect on a regular basis, so that respecting women is something we have experience doing. We need you to put up with our shit when we're embodying human imperfection and throw it back at us when we deserve it, because if you don't, no one does and then it happens again. We need you to call us out. We need you to not quit in the face of adversity, because our daughters should not have to go through what you already have.<p>Being a rare specimen is hard, but we need you. The future needs this to be fixed. And if enough of you hang in there when the going gets tough, eventually it can stop being rare, and stop being hard.",1356749965

It's a pdf, so I am not too worried about what it might post.<p>It asked for permissions to post to access my news, and I was a bit surprised, why would scribd need to access my news? There was no explanation.<p>So I denied it that access.<p>At some point it demanded that I sign up for a paid plan that it assured me was just a $10 per month and easy to cancel. There seemed to be no other way to access that file unless I joined their paid plan. If there is such a way, it seems very non-obvious how to do it.<p>This all so I could download a pdf that it had offered to me in the beginning.<p>Now maybe it's because I am something of a Facebook newbie, or maybe their facebook app was having problems, or maybe my combination of Chrome settings and extensions broke their app somehow.<p>Regardless, it seems terrible that scribd demands access to post on my timeline, to read my news, and that I pay to login.<p>I have flagged this link as spam (sorry sr3d) and though I understand that scribd is a YCombinator alum, I hope more than ever it fails and fails hard.

4980863,comment,4980350,4980350,9,0,zeidrich,,,"To be fair to the author, she doesn't claim that everything is a result of sexism.  The down-right douchebaggery is more apt a description for the majority of it, but there's no question that sex factors into big parts of it.<p>There's a lot of egos in these communities, there are a lot  of young people with adolescent hormones and something to prove. The communities themselves are pretty insular, and distinguish themselves by being exclusive.<p>Girls are outsiders, for whatever reason.  I wont speculate as to how this started, but it can perpetuate by staying hostile to girls.  These communities strive to maintain some exclusivity; you're something special, better than others, smarter than others.  You can't just let anyone new in, then you won't be so special.<p>So in this article, you have a girl (outsider) who is non-technical (going to get ridiculed whether you're a boy or a girl) trying to exert her will (which is going to get you into fights regardless).<p>Sexism is a thing. It's not a good thing. However, I don't think that removing sexism from this kind of community is a possibility, because sexism isn't the basic issue here.  I think that the basic issue is the general exclusivity of the community. It's not a group to educate new people.  In fact it's a group that is hostile towards ""noobs"".  It's a group that is trying to restrict membership to those who are similar, who think similarly, or who can bully their way to the top.<p>I think that the better situation is to recognize that this crowd of douchebaggery does exist.  The way you fight it isn't to try and get into it and start shouting at people to change it.  That's at best going to make you hoarse, and at worst going to make you one of them.  I think that to deal with this is to do the kind of things that the author did.<p>The wiki creation, the creation of the cryptoparty.  These are the things that should be focused on. This is actually some cool stuff, and the author, a woman, was instrumental.  Now the thing about the idea is it's not something that is owned by the author, it's just a good idea, and douchebags can make use of good ideas.<p>I think the problem was that the author gets herself wrapped up in trying to control and maintain the purity of her idea and in the end gets drawn into pissing contests with other people trying to prove something. This is going to happen whether you're a girl or a guy, however when you're a girl, the guys have that knife in the wound already and they just need to twist it.<p>Naw, I think instead the way to do it best is to endeavor to make this knowledge available to more people.  Make it harder to be exclusive.  Make it something that anyone can learn.  People can be douchebags when it's them vs. the world. They can't be when it's just knowledge.<p>So I guess the question is, are you trying to educate, or are you hoping to get people to accept you into their exclusive club?  If you're trying to do the former, then I wish you all the luck and support in the world.  If it's the latter, then even if you get your wish, you'll end up treating others how you hate being treated, whether by race, age, prior knowledge, whatever or else it will stop being an exclusive club.<p>I agree that sexism is a problem.  But it's a big problem. It's a problem that demands a lot of attention. You set up, or helped set up, a framework, and then put yourself under pressure to control how that framework is being used and abused all over the place; all the while still feeling responsible for fighting sexism within this framework.  I think that's far too much for one person to handle, and I can promise that if a guy were to try it he wouldn't have any better success just because the other guys respected his testicles.<p>Anyways, I commend the author's efforts, and I think the best way to combat that form of general douchebaggery is to make the thing that they hold above everyone else available to the mainstream.  You don't stop sexism by going to the men's club and ranting at them to treat women nicely.  You stop sexism by letting women vote, by training them to be doctors and engineers, and otherwise giving them, (and further, any other excluded parties) access to those things that were held over their heads before. And it's not a fast process, it's a very slow and hard one.  But don't be discouraged, I think she did something good. Small, but good.",1356749340

Even in a language without classes, you still have a way of representing your data that you could use. In C you would use structs, in a functional language you'd use a Type or whatever.<p>You're mostly looking at a way to say ""this entity belongs to this entity"" and ""this entity has many of this entity"". That kind of thing. Classes or not, you still have a programming-level way of representing that.<p>Even for languages that don't idiomatically have you use classes for everything, this is still where you <i>would</i> use them.

4980782,comment,4980539,4980539,3,0,keesj,,,"For anyone else wondering what this API is about:<p>It generates a (random) UUID. According to Wikipedia ""the intent of UUIDs is to enable distributed systems to uniquely identify information without significant central coordination. In this context the word unique should be taken to mean ""practically unique"" rather than ""guaranteed unique"". Since the identifiers have a finite size it is possible for two differing items to share the same identifier. The identifier size and generation process need to be selected so as to make this sufficiently improbable in practice. Anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify something with reasonable confidence that the same identifier will never be unintentionally created by anyone to identify something else. Information labeled with UUIDs can therefore be later combined into a single database without needing to resolve identifier (ID) conflicts.<p>One widespread use of this standard is in Microsoft's globally unique identifiers (GUIDs). Other significant uses include ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem UUIDs, LUKS encrypted partitions, GNOME, KDE, and Mac OS X, all of which use implementations derived from the uuid library found in the e2fsprogs package.""<p>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier</a>",1356747642

4980732,comment,4980220,4980220,17,0,windexh8er,,,"So...  A problem here - there's a lot of startup in the home automation space right now.  I've been using MiCasaVerde for over a year now and it's awesome.  Fully controllable and configurable via the MiOS GUI, or hack it to your heart's content via Lua scripts.  The awesome thing is there's plenty of devices you can buy OTS right now whether Z-Wave (built-in) or Insteon (add-on USB adapter).  What confuses me about what NinjaBlocks is trying to do is - they don't cater to anyone who already HAS home automation...  Meaning: I'd buy it for $200, but they don't say what I can integrate with.  I'm not going to spend another grand on switches, dimmers, motion detectors, locks, etc. if I don't know I can reuse my investment.  That's a big part of why Spark is not a good option IMHO (<a href=""http://www.sparkdevices.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkdevices.com/</a>) - because they're using 802.11 WiFi (I don't want my home automation components on Wifi for a variety of reasons, but the first two are: 1) WiFi doesn't have a low-power advantage like ZigBee, Z-Wave, Insteon, etc. and 2) WiFi doesn't automagically create a mesh network for auto-routing and network extension).<p>Then you have a startup like SmartThings (<a href=""http://smartthings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smartthings.com/</a>) that's just reinventing the wheel, creating a pretty iOS interface, and then trying to charge an outrageous amount for a monthly service - something MiCasaVerde doesn't do.  So, at the end of the day would I use SmartThings?  I'd like to - but I won't because I don't want to pay $120 a year for something I can run better in my own infrastructure.  I don't want you selling my energy usage data or knowing if I'm home, with something like MiCasaVerde - I can choose not to use their cloud proxy to control my home.<p>If anyone is listening who's designing home automation and wants to cater to people who are looking at building a service to deploy these types of automation to the masses you need to do it right.  Baby Boomers, at least the majority of them, will think all of the above are too complicated, so they're going to want someone to install and maintain this for them.  There's a huge middleground that needs to be solved here and unless SmartThings and others are going to provide a service, that $10/month is not going to be justified.<p>Back to NinjaBlocks, please answer the following:\n1) Monthly fee if I use your cloud proxy to hit the controller?  If so - how much?\n2) If #1 is true - is the API directly accessible on the controller - or are you locking me in?\n3) Low power integration (i.e. ZigBee, Z-Wave, Insteon, etc.)?  Answered my own Q: No...  From (<a href=""http://help.ninjablocks.com/customer/portal/articles/692139-what-rf-devices-can-my-ninja-block-talk-to-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://help.ninjablocks.com/customer/portal/articles/692139-...</a>): ""The original Ninja Block comes with a RF 433.92 Mhz (433) dongle and future Ninja Blocks will have this baked in. 433 is awesome because you will find it in all sorts of low-cost battery powered devices, its range is pretty good too. That said, its not all sunshine and lollipops - there are good reasons its considered ""low-tech"" - only one device can ""talk"" at a time, labelling is appalling, all protocols are proprietary. So not everything will work out of the box, but a lot of stuff will. ""   <<<<<----- Sorry, but this sucks, I'm out.  You need to have a <i>real</i> and baked solution besides this 433Mhz junk that's not mesh, and has zero security baked in.  There's no way I'll pay $200 for this with zero long term scalability or security in mind.<p>Again, another pretty solution that's just a toy.  For my money I'd go with SmartThings - but for the long term I'm sticking with my MiCasaVerde (<a href=""http://micasaverde.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://micasaverde.com</a>) setup - cost feasible and fully in my control and no monthly costs.

This means I do not have to think much when refactoring my data. And I do not have to worry about production systems crashing due to old data being different from new.<p>When modifying the schema in NoSQL databases I always worry about if I mess up and leave old cruft which will cause my code to crash, or even worse if I lose data (data created between the last backup and the upgrade).<p>With proper SQL constraints there are many fewer ways where you can screw up when refactoring. And easy refactoring of data is key to agile development of systems which have been put into production.",1356746741

The regular groups I am in - one is a local group, one is a memorial group for someone who died young, one was started by a friend for his hobby.<p>The secret group has a lock on its tab and says ""Secret Group - Only members see the group, who's in it, and what members post"".  No one who I am friends with knows I'm in the group aside from people in the group.  Not sure what more to say - it has a wall which is somewhat active, although content was better and more diverse when the group started, now it is mostly 1-2 boring friend-of-friend chatterboxes.  It also had a chat room, although Facebook killed group chat rooms a few months ago.",1356746695

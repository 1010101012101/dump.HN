This may, or may not, seem a bit outlandish but there is a reason it is so lucrative. So my answer would be porn.<p>I read a figure that said something like 70%+ of ALL Internet searches are related to porn, sex, or nudity. Not that I have really given it much thought, but I am positive there are dozens of ways you could get to $1million in porn. I have a couple off the top of my head:<p>1. Tube site: I&#x27;m sure you could get video crawlers that take videos from other porn sites. You could go on eBay and buy views for all of those videos to inflate the perception of the traffic you are producing to other users. Then you could use an ad network for popups, banner ads, or whatever.<p>2. Cam site: These are supposed to be super popular, as pirating (although still an issue I&#x27;m sure) is much harder. There are numerous examples of popular cam sites, but because it is &quot;porn&quot; all of them are shady. There have been numerous complaints filed against the owners of myfreecams for example. I guess for this after you develop the site, you could use Craigslist to find models. Drive traffic to the site (again, it&#x27;s porn, so marketing naked girls would seem to be easier to market than some eBook), leverage social media, or whatever else. You could also promote traffic for some other site, but affiliate marketing is overrated in my opinion. No offense to anyone doing it, but it just seems like an awful amount of work for a measly scrap of the revenue you could be seeing if you owned the site/content or whatever.<p>3. Produce your own content: Now this does need some overhead. Cameras, a somewhat trained crew, models, lawyers, location etc. This one would be what I would stay away from. Too much headache for me personally.<p>I am not saying turn into a &quot;smut peddler&quot; or some porn kingpin, but if your sole goal is to get to $1million as quickly as possible, porn seems like a great solution. Porn is recession proof, there will always be a demand, and you can&#x27;t argue with the numbers. Best of luck.",1371332559

It&#x27;s very hard, as a European, to find any news coverage of world affairs in the US that doesn&#x27;t subscribe to the official Washington party line (with small diversions, according to which of the two parties the outlet/author supports).<p>><i>If you are interested in what their reactions were when this kind of thing happened in China, back in 2010, this [1] (google translate: [2]) was xinhuanet&#x27;s opinion on Chinese human rights activist, Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Liu Xiaobo [3]. They described Liu Xiaobo as an evil man used by western countries to attack Chinese government, while the truth is Liu Xiaobo spent years striving for Chinese people&#x27;s freedom, human rights, and constitution enforcement in China.</i><p>So?<p>There is a way to strive for your people&#x27;s &quot;freedom, human rights, and constitution enforcement&quot; that&#x27;s in accordance to your countries and your people&#x27;s needs (even if your government hates it) AND there is another way to fight for &quot;freedom, human rights, and constitution enforcement&quot; that serves the agenda of foreign powers. The second way is mostly how you earn a &quot;Nobel Prize&quot; (which Obama also got, oh, the irony).<p>It&#x27;s difficult to convey the above distinction to an American, not because they can&#x27;t understand it, but because they haven&#x27;t experienced it. See, the US is a world leader, so there&#x27;s not another country that can even think of using people to influence American politics, topple politicians, grab it&#x27;s resources, etc. Things that happen all the time in smaller countries -- and more often than not, those people (&quot;freedom fighters&quot;, etc) are agents of US foreign policy (or French, or UK, etc -- it&#x27;s what&#x27;s called neo-colonialism).",1371332453

It was a deliberate obstruction built into Windows XP that was meant to stop people from using the OS as a multiuser server.  It is no different from Maltab contacting a license server to determine if there are too many people using the program at a time (as was the case at my undergrad university) or a parking garage refusing to release anyone&#x27;s car because a license expired.  The Windows Server version supported multiple simultaneous remote desktop sessions (with an artificial limit imposed by the software, that depended on the license; Windows XP Home/Professional simply had this limit hard-coded).<p>I think you are lacking citations needed to prove your point that we would not have movie and music players if they were not deliberately restricted.  There were digital music players prior to the iPod that were not so restricted.  CDs never had any restrictions built in; what makes you think DVDs would never have happened without the restrictions?  I know for a <i>fact</i> that you are wrong about HDCP, because <i>the same cable receiver had HD component outputs</i> that had no HDCP requirements.<p>To put it another way, if people <i>demanded</i> Freedom 0, they would have it -- and there would still have been DVDs and iPods.  The MPAA is not going to give up a multi-billion dollar market.

It&#x27;s better to get one tailored to your exact measurements (needs) than to buy a suit mass produced in the most popular, requested sizes.<p>In theory, proprietary software cannot fulfill this function as well as open source, because a programmer could just identify his own problem using his own experience and solve it.

The problem was that the kids were smart enough to know that they could just keep trying random sites until they got through the simplistic measures that flat blocklists were taking, and it was just a matter of time before they&#x27;d finally find something that wasn&#x27;t in a list and get through.<p>I came up with the bright idea of turning the blocking off, and turning the blocklist into a honeypot regex matcher in the squid logs and deep packet inspection on accessed urls.

Or this long letter from John Adams to John Taylor, source of this shopworn quote on democracy [1]:<p>>&quot;You say, I might have exhibited millions of plebeians sacrificed to the pride, folly, and ambition of monarcy and aristocracy. This is very true. And I might have exhibited as many millions of plebeians sacrificed by the pride, folly, and ambition of their fellow-plebeians and their own, in proportion to the extent and duration of their power. Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.&quot;<p>...<p>>&quot;Democracy is chargeable with all the blood that has been spilled for five-and-twenty years.<p>>Napoleon and all his generals were but creatures of democracy, as really as Rienzi, Theodore, Massaniello, Jack Cade, or Wat Tyler. This democratical hurricane, inundation, earthquake, pestilence, call it which you will, at last aroused and alarmed all the world, and produced a combination unexampled, to prevent its further progress.&quot;<p>Currently, our politicians quite rightly talk of the US as a democracy, because it is such a universal suffrage state within the shell of a republic.<p>>What exactly are you referring to? You seem to be arguing that the word fascism is overused, and then go on to explain that democracy would lead to tyranny, and at least the NSA understands that.\nThis is so broken I really, really wish you could elaborate. Call it morbid curiosity.<p>I&#x27;m actually quite familiar with the Chomsky critique of the American system for restricting democracy. That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m referring to.<p>1. I dislike it when people use &#x27;fascist&#x27; as an all-purpose insult meaning &#x27;form of government that I don&#x27;t like that people have been propagandized against.&#x27; I suggest that people actually read fascist tracts (like &#x27;The Doctrine of Fascism&#x27; [2]) if they&#x27;re going to use the term. When people use the word, their brains shut off. It&#x27;s also vulgar to claim that fascism is just the &#x27;unification of corporations and the state.&#x27;<p>Now, part of the problem is that fascists were themselves gooey about the definition of what their system was -- but it&#x27;s clear that whatever economic system they chose to use was subordinate to their &#x27;spiritual&#x27; goals -- and that &#x27;spiritual&#x27; outlook is mostly absent in the US system. While the US system may share certain characteristics of fascist states, it is not itself fascistic, and proclaiming that it is just muddles the discussion. It confuses effects with causes.<p>The reason why that&#x27;s important is because if you believe that secret fascists are the ones corrupting the republic, all you need to do is find the scapegoats and hang them. The truth is that the source of these abuses comes from a deeper source -- the idea that constitutions the source of some strange law-magic that can restrict the actions of people in government. Regardless of how clever it seemed in the 18th century, it&#x27;s now quite obvious that paper with words on it is not a source of eldritch government-restricting powers.<p>2. Yes, the current state under democracy is entirely a predictable consequence of the political form. I would say that Chomsky&#x27;s reading of &#x27;Politics&#x27; is incorrect in a general sense while being correct in a couple specific aspects (saying that democracy is a counter-weight to oligarchy). It&#x27;d be very tough to make a case that Aristotle saw a political system based on the first principle that men are equal in any sense as workable (because he writes the opposite in Book V, paragraph 3 [3]). &#x27;Politics&#x27; is an essentially cynical work that describes how all political systems tend to crumble with time and the influence of human vice. While I can see why Chomsky would interpret it in the way that he does, I&#x27;d say that he&#x27;s cherry picking to make a point for his favored system. Much in the same way that the founders did, arguably, to lend a classical garland to their new republic.<p>Hope I&#x27;ve satisfied your morbid curiosity.<p>Anyway, the NSA&#x27;s actions are consistent with the addled mission of the American state as a whole. You can&#x27;t provide security for Europe, the Pacific regions, certain Middle East states, many parts of Asia, and the Americas without a global surveillance state to support that mission. The main issue is that the broad policies are not achievable and shouldn&#x27;t be pursued in the first place. Trying to limit what the NSA can do while also trying to preserve current US policies is just confused. You can&#x27;t have both privacy and Empire. The former impedes the latter too much.<p>Yet, tyrannical aggression, both internationally and domestically, are popular political platforms. &#x27;The people&#x27; are just getting cold feet about what that requires. Just another point against giving the wheel of state to the fickle and blood-soaked hands of &#x27;the people.&#x27;<p>[1]<a href=""http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2104&chapter=159956&layout=html&Itemid=27"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=s...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.upf.edu/materials/fhuma/nacionalismes/nacio/docs/muss-doctrine.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.upf.edu/materials/fhuma/nacionalismes/nacio/docs/...</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.5.five.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.5.five.html</a>",1371330320

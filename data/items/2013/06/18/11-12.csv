Joy, love, hope, desire, anger, frustration, etc. I&#x27;ll say that a NEAR death experience tends to be more of a gift, it happened to my brother and changed him drastically.  Not all for the better, but much of it was good.<p>I think the idea of calling death a gift is bullshit.  Yes, you can learn and grow from the death of a loved one, but that isn&#x27;t a gift, it&#x27;s the absence of their presence (the real gift) that makes you realize what you had.<p>To me, life without the lows and highs, is boring.

Our electoral system has evolved over the past century to be, quite honestly, one of the most open, progressive and balanced electoral systems in the world.<p>What we in Australia call &quot;exhaustive preferential voting&quot; is sometimes called &quot;instant runoff voting&quot; elsewhere. Having to number every box is a <i>feature</i>, not a bug. If you don&#x27;t have an exhaustive ballot, then in practice political parties will encourage voters to &quot;just vote 1&quot; -- to mark only one box.<p>And then you&#x27;ve arrived at a first-past-the-post system, which is what IRV is trying to get away from in the first place.<p>In the House of Reps, few candidates turn out because it&#x27;s very difficult for a non-major party candidate to win. It happens, but only rarely. So in any given seat it would be unusual to find more than 5 or 6 candidates -- 2 majors, a green, whatever microparty is currently making a push and perhaps the local village idiot or somebody who doesn&#x27;t realise that running as an independent is a mug&#x27;s game.<p>But the Senate is different. The Senate is based on proportional representation. Each State elects 6 senators, and the Senate seats are effectively allocated to parties according to the final distribution of votes. In a recursive process, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes redistributed according to the voter preferences, up and up until there are 6 people with a full &quot;quota&quot; of votes.<p>The thing about the Senate is that the <i>final Senate seat in any given state is usually in play</i>. The top 4 seats are almost always won equally by the majors; the 5th usually won by a major or the Greens. But the 6th seats can and frequently do wind up in the hands of the most unlikely people because of the complicated preference deals I described above.<p>Because there is a <i>chance</i> for a microparty candidate to wind up in the Senate, lots of people run. Being a Senator is a pretty sweet deal. Good pay, your own offices and staff, travel entitlements and the like. And if you luck into holding the balance of power in the Senate, you&#x27;ve just become a very powerful individual.",1371555348

5898570,comment,5893442,5893442,3,0,bjourne,,,"Let&#x27;s begin by stating that Haskell is great, but there are a lot of stuff I don&#x27;t like about it:<p>1. Way to many user defined operators. Haskell lets you define almost anything as an infix operator which library authors love to (ab)use. So you get operators like &quot;.&&&.&quot; (without the quotes) because they are functions reminiscent of the boolean and operation.<p>2. But weirdly enough, many operators aren&#x27;t generic. String concatenation is performed with &quot;++&quot; but addition with &quot;+&quot;.<p>3. Incomplete and inconsistent prelude. It has unwords and words for splitting and joining a string on whitespace. But you dont get to specify what string to use as the delimiter like the join and split functions in other languages lets you do.<p>4. So instead you have X number of implementations of splitStringWith on Hackage, some of which are unmaintained, deprecated or just not working, meaning that just answering the question &quot;how should I split a string?&quot; becomes a big endeavour (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4978578/how-to-split-a-string-in-haskell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4978578/how-to-split-a-st...</a>).<p>5. There are four different &quot;stringish&quot; types in Haskell: List, LazyList, ByteString, LazyByteString. A function like splitStringWith works on one of the types, but not the three others for which you need other functions. Some libraries expect Lists, other ByteStrings or LazyByteStrings so you have to keep converting your string to the different types.<p>6. Most Haskellers seem to content with just having type declarations as the api documentation. That&#x27;s not a fault of Haskell per se, but imho a weakness in the Haskell community. For example, here is the documentation for the Data.Foldable module: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/p"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/p</a>\nackages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Data-Foldable.html<p>7.

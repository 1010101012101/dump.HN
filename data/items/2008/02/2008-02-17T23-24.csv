Few people or organizations are capable of sustained, on-demand, innovation.<p>So, yes, if you can pull that off, you're golden anyway.",1203292086

That's in the UK; whereabout are you talking about?<p>If the taste of the water really bothers you, in the UK they sell large water jugs which fill through charcoal filters (Brita), which remove any chlorine taste and only needed changing monthly or so.",1203291446

117806,comment,117727,117727,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I love Scott, but this shows a fundamental lack of understanding for why wars happen. The American Civil War comes to mind as the first counterexample. There are dozens more.<p>Nations don't resort to armed conflict because the citizens don't know each other that well. In fact, the counterexamples are very interesting -- I'm thinking of German presence in Great Britain before WWII. People demonize citizens of other nations after war is started, but that's more of a moral crutch than anything else. I think Scott confuses correlation with causality.",1203289702

Perhaps this encouragement will make me apply!<p>EDIT:  I even wrote about it a long time ago, when I still updated my blog with any semblance of regularity.  Weebly seems to be down for approximately the millionth time in the last month or so, though.  I'll post the article if Weebly gets righted within the edit window.",1203289700

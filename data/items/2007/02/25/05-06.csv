Also, the VC firm could own 90% of the company now or something- it's not like they handed them a $10m check and said have fun.",1172383074

That's how I submit all my links in reddit.  This site doesn't have that, so I wonder if I'm wasting my time when thinking up or typing in a title for a submission - since it may already have been submitted.  <p>Also, I need the &#34;save link&#34; feature.<p>Good site so far.

Digg and more recently Reddit, are experiencing a loss of focus and quality and as a result are losing their initial users.

Apparently, there arent enough old users around to down-vote the crap posted by the noobal hoard. From a quick read of comments, it seems many long-time users are angry and feel disenfranchised.  Its because of this that those users whose content made Digg and Reddit popular in the first place are now leaving those sites and taking their great ideas with them.<p>2. No troll guards:\nNothing poisons an online community quicker than a few nasty trolls.  Another one of the reasons that Im pulling away from Reddit is because it is getting mean.

2241171,comment,2240878,2241145,0,0,micks56,,,"In college I took a course called ""Physics of Alpine Skiing."" A manufacturing engineering professor taught the course. He was a big ski racer in his younger days. While searching for a college major, and generally just drifting along, a mentor at his school explained to him that skiing is machining. This got the professor interested in manufacturing engineering. The professor ended up having a successful collegiate ski race career AND an inspired academic career. College graduate became PhD graduate and eventually a tenured full professor at a major engineering research university.<p>The professor's interest in skiing gave him direction for his life's work. Professor performs manufacturing and machining research, using his intuition and experience from the slopes and applies it in his labs.<p>This professor is a campus favorite, inspiring many in his courses, and often advises senior design projects that deal with winter sports technologies, which gives those students skills that are valuable in the workplace.<p>Without a ski race program this person would not have even been in college. He would have been skiing and skiing only. The US would not have had a competent manufacturing researcher and professor.<p>This seems to show benefit from sports programs. No?",1298181436

2241159,comment,2241011,2241011,0,0,dkersten,,,"I disagree with most anti-bottled water comments. I drink bottled water. I used to drink it a lot. I have spent significant time trying different brands to find out which I liked best. I always shopped for taste (ie, I have never looked into how ""healthy"" or clean or whatever it is compared to tap water, nor do I care).<p>Dunno about where everybody else is, but this is at least true here, in Ireland. Maybe bottled water in the US is different? I don't know.<p>Until recently, when I got a water filter, I always drank bottled water. I love water and drink a LOT of it and always chose bottled water for taste. The really cheap bottled water usually tastes like crap, but the midrange to higher priced water tastes a lot better. Of the water sold locally, Volvic is my favourite. Tap water here tastes TERRIBLE. Even the filtered water I drink now doesn't taste as nice as bottled water and I'd still drink bottled water if it wasn't so expensive compared to buying filter replacements every now and then. There is a GIANT difference in taste between different brands of water. I don't know if its the water itself or the plastic it is packaged in[1].<p>Some of my friends think I'm crazy and can't taste the difference. I definitely can and I suspect the reason is that for the first fifteen or sixteen years of my life, I HATED all bottled water because it taste terrible compared to the tap water at home. I grew up in the country and the tap water came from a stream from the mountain at the back of the house. It was collected in a stone well and filtered through granite slabs. Thats it. No bottled water has come close to the taste of that water and until I moved to the city, I hated bottled water. I had friends who grew up in nearby towns and I never liked their tap water very much. But when I moved to the city, the tap water tastes extremely bad and I chose bottled water as the better of too bad options. I've since got used to bottled water, though drink it less due to getting a filter. So: mountain water > bottled water > filtered tap water > tap water<p>(Sadly the well has since been decomissioned due to contaminants (the mountain was used for farming and there are a lot of animals kept around where the well was) and while the water it has been replaced with is still nicer than town water and most bottled water, it is nowhere near as nice as the old water was)<p>[1] for example, recently I did a blind taste test with Milk, because I prefer to buy two brands (most shops only sell two or three brands. All shops sell at least one of the two brands I favor and often at least one other one. These others generally depend on the shop and region, some shops do have other brands I like, generally they are sold in tetrapak cartons, see below) of Milk due to taste. I could not taste the difference between tetrapak milk between the two brands that I buy, but I could between plastic cartons of the same two brands. With plastic, I could also taste the difference between the brands I buy and other brands. I am certain the taste difference is due to the plastic used in the cartons, not the Milk itself. I bet its the same for bottled water.",1298180753

Good luck getting soft skills there.<p>Real learning occurs while playing sports.

Stallman is an idealist and attaches moral value to the licensing of code. Torvalds is an engineer and just wants to ship code. His license of choice matches his model for doing this.<p>Basically Stallman is ideologically opposed to the existence of proprietary software and Torvalds is fine with a mixture of free/open software mixed with proprietary software.<p>The two of them are often mentioned together because the largest results of their labours (the GNU userland and the linux kernel) are combined to form 'linux based distributions', generally just referred to as 'Linux' (or 'GNU/Linux' as Stallman insists, because he justifiably wants some more public recognition of the impact of his project even if that just isn't the way things work).<p>Considering their differences and the way in which their works are combined it shouldn't be that surprising that there's some friction and snarky comments that spill out from time to time.",1298178255

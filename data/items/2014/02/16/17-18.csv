7248444,comment,7244109,7247305,1,0,lutusp,,,"> For fun replace &#x27;psychology&#x27; with &#x27;quantum physics&#x27;. Is it also not science?<p>There are fundamental differences. In quantum theory one can craft a theory that makes empirically falsifiable predictions about phenomena not yet observed, even in advance by decades, like the Higgs boson.<p>The theory is the Standard Model, and it predicted the Higgs boson decades ago. Much time passed because we just didn&#x27;t have a way to observe reality in the right energy domain. Now we do.<p>There is nothing remotely like this in psychology.<p>> Contradicts some natural laws<p>Not really. The quantum and relativistic worlds are non-overlapping, but both have copious observational evidence, which means we need to look for a theory that explains both of them in a unified way. That search is underway. One candidate is string theory, very controversial because no single string theory candidate is the obvious &quot;final theory&quot;.<p>> Is not explained by the natural world except in reference to itself<p>This is a non sequitur because it&#x27;s true for any theory -- at some scale it becomes self-referential. Cosmology, a theory about everything, is self-referential at the level of the entire universe.<p>> Not necessarily testable against the empirical world<p>No. Quantum theory is constantly empirically tested and is the best-confirmed theory in existence, both in terms of description and prediction. In fact, the computer you&#x27;re sitting at represents a confirmation of quantum theory.<p>There is no other scientific theory that has so much agreement between an abstract theoretical construct and careful observation. During the debates that led to modern quantum theory, Einstein and his group (the critics) posed any number of seemingly absurd objections to quantum (&quot;... and that would be a perfectly absurd outcome&quot;), but each of the objections turned out to be true -- entanglement, superposition of states and others.<p>There are some quantities predicted by quantum theory that have been confirmed in experiment to ten decimal places -- an outcome unmatched by any other scientific theory.<p>Title: &quot;The Most Precisely Tested Theory in the History of Science&quot;<p>Link: <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2011/05/05/the-most-precisely-tested-theo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2011/05/05/the-most-preci...</a><p>Quote: &quot;Experimental tests of QED measure small shifts, but to an absurd number of decimal places. The most impressive of these is the “anomalous magnetic moment of the electron,” expressed is terms of a number g whose best measured value is: g/2 = 1.001 159 652 180 73 (28) ... Depending on how you want to count it, that’s either 11 or 14 digits of precision ...&quot;<p>> Falsifiable or not depending on your stance<p>Definitely falsifiable. There was much discussion before confirmation of the Higgs that its absence would constitute a falsification of much of the Standard Model, which is technically accurate and was a matter of much speculation before the results were in.<p>Quantum theory is eminently falsifiable in the classic sense, persistently resists falsification, and is the cornerstone of much of modern technology.<p>> As for Kahneman (and many other psychologists), if you believe that he starts with the conclusion and refuses to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation ...<p>Wait, I never said that and I don&#x27;t hold that view. What I said was that Kahnemann&#x27;s work <i>describes</i>, it doesn&#x27;t <i>explain</i>. It is in the area of explanation that psychology fails. To explain (and to put it simply), psychologists would have to seek out root causes of behaviors, but that would require the mind to be a physical organ, open to empirical observation. This is why society is moving away from psychology toward neuroscience -- the chance to offer an empirical, falsifiable explanation.<p>(What follows should clearly demonstrate the difference between description and explanation.)<p>Neuroscience is in a rather primitive state, but there are some very encouraging signs. Depression, for example, a condition that psychology can&#x27;t really treat in a way that distinguishes actual results from the placebo effect.<p>In a recent neuroscience study, a brain area known as Area 25 has become a matter of much interest because deep brain stimulation of Area 25 can cause a patient&#x27;s depression to lift <i>instantly</i>.<p>Title: &quot;A Depression Switch?&quot;<p>Link: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/magazine/02depression.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/magazine/02depression.html...</a><p>Quote: &quot;Deanna later described it in similar terms. &quot;It was literally like a switch being turned on that had been held down for years,&quot; she said. &quot;All of a sudden they hit the spot, and I feel so calm and so peaceful. It was overwhelming to be able to process emotion on somebody&#x27;s face. I&#x27;d been numb to that for so long.&quot;&quot;<p>I emphasize that the patient in this procedure repeatedly experienced a dramatic improvement for reasons she could not see, by means of actions out of her sight. Until this procedure, she had been so depressed that she had given up on life and voluntarily submitted herself to institutionalization.<p>> Medical science moved past simply treating based on symptoms due to a great deal of work. Who&#x27;s to say psychology can not do the same?<p>That&#x27;s easy to answer -- psychology&#x27;s topic is the mind, which, because it is not a physical thing, cannot be a source of empirical evidence. And surely, given the present confidence crisis, if psychologists could produce empirically verifiable, testable results accompanied by explanations, they certainly would. But they cannot.",1392573265

7248432,comment,7247690,7247763,20,0,indygreg2,,,"I can relate to these comments because when I was a Git user forced to use Mercurial for Firefox development, I initially thought much of the same. I have since come around [1].<p>Mercurial has come a long way in the last few years. While I used to see repo corruption semi-frequently, I have not seen it once in the last year or so. This can be attributed to bug fixes and less reliance on mq. mq is a giant hack on top of Mercurial&#x27;s storage model and there were many corner cases in older Mercurials where mq could lead to repo corruption. I use the experimental evolve extension now, but I can&#x27;t yet recommend that to the masses because it&#x27;s very rough around the edges. Hopefully in the next 6-12 months.<p>I strongly disagree with the statement that Mercurial is less flexible than Git. I find Mercurial to be <i>more</i> flexible. If you don&#x27;t take my word for it, ask Facebook [2]: &quot;Our engineers were comfortable with Git and we preferred to stay with a familiar tool, so we took a long, hard look at improving it to work at scale. After much deliberation, we concluded that Git&#x27;s internals would be difficult to work with for an ambitious scaling project.&quot; The article goes on to describe some key areas where Mercurial is more flexible.<p>Some things possible in Mercurial that aren&#x27;t with Git:<p>* Extending the wire protocol. Git&#x27;s wire protocol is the exchange of objects (key-value pairs) and refs to said objects. Mercurial&#x27;s is command-based and you can have client and server talk their own commands.<p>* Revision sets [3]. Extremely useful feature. See [4] for how I&#x27;ve used this as Mozilla.<p>* Phases. Mercurial knows when you are changing a published and should-be-immutable changeset/commit and by default prevents you from footgunning yourself.<p>* Changeset evolution. The mindset about &quot;pushing rebases is evil&quot; has its roots almost completely in limitations of tools. Changeset evolution removes that limitation.<p>As I wrote at [1], I believe the future of Mercurial is bright. Don&#x27;t discount Mercurial because of past experiences with ancient versions or because you assume the Git way is the only and right way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2013/05/12/thoughts-on-mercurial-%28and-git%29/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2013/05/12/thoughts-on-mercuria...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-merc...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.selenic.com/hg/help/revsets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.selenic.com/hg/help/revsets</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2013/11/08/using-mercurial-to-query-mozilla-metadata/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2013/11/08/using-mercurial-to-q...</a>",1392573047

In any serious project, you will want to have lots of small files to ease development, and then concatenate into larger files to ensure optimal http loading. If you don&#x27;t already do this regardless of modules, you probably should.<p>Point 2: If you are intentionally or serendipitously relying on script execution order, that is your bug. The module loader has helpfully exposed a bug in your code for you.<p>Point 3: If you have lots of modules, it is simpler to deal with a module system than mashing together a load of scripts.<p>This complaint should come with a severe disclaimer that it only applies to trivial applications, because as soon as you start building something complicated the arguments are just plain wrong.<p>Software engineering is hard, and robust software engineering practices usually only pay off once you get beyond trivial examples.

7248387,comment,7245205,7247092,1,0,mpyne,,,"> I hope that we as a technological community can fight this on a global scale, not nation per nation. Abusing the internet for espionage and warfare sucks.<p>I agree 100%, but the problem is we don&#x27;t get a unilateral vote.<p>Geopolitically it makes <i>perfect sense</i> for authoritarian regimes to engage in cyberwar. All legality aside, they would be stupid not to.<p>There is not much anyone (UN, EU, etc.) can do about it. We&#x27;re not going to declare war (in the kinetic sense) over the cyber equivalent of spying/covert ops. We&#x27;re not going to engage in sanctions that strangle both our economies over the cyber equivalent of spying/covert ops.<p>And they know that, just as well as we do. There is <i>every</i> incentive for them to do it, and essentially no disincentive.<p>So the cyberwar is on. (And, it&#x27;s <i>been</i> on).<p>And that&#x27;s not even getting into the transnational actors who abuse seams and gaps of jurisdictional boundaries between law enforcement, national intelligence, &quot;dual-use&quot; civilian/military networks, etc. in order to organize their own activities.<p>The best thing we can do is extremely good defense (which due to scale must be mostly passive with few active measures employed). And we <i>should</i> pursue that, but market pressures will always, always go against that.<p>Even if the U.S. were to, say, regulate that computer systems should be designed to combat security vulnerabilities (and NIST has just released a guideline on that), other nations would not necessarily do that and so nations without that requirement could run rings around U.S. software shops by releasing buggier software first and with faster feature iteration cycles. And that&#x27;s assuming you could &quot;fix the market&quot; with proper regulation in the first place, which is certainly unclear.<p>And where would open source software fall into that? Do we want to forbid individual devs from uploading their wares to GitHub until they&#x27;ve completely a 27-page checklist?<p>> Here, the NSA were really acting against their best interest by weakening existing defenses.<p>In fairness AFAICS the one crypto standard they weakened was <i>only</i> weakened against NSA, not in general (though that would certainly not make you feel better if you were trying to hide from NSA). But at the same time I never figured out specifics on whether NSA was convincing companies to ship known-broken code, actively adding other backdoors, or what. But if their involvement was limited to convincing companies like Cisco to default to Dual EC DRBG then that&#x27;s not nearly as bad as convincing Cisco to ship a broken zlib.<p>> Having several barriers of entry is good practice in security, why not just make sure that there are secured channels with stronger security for sensitive data.<p>Even without market pressures, the fact is that cyber defense falls prey to the fact that the attacker generally need only be right once, which the defender must be right <i>every</i> time. I hate to be Debbie Downer here but you&#x27;re speaking to an extremely hard problem, and it doesn&#x27;t get any easier if you take all the other possible tools away.<p>Certainly there are industries taking more stringent precautions, but the problem is that the bum-standard civilian Internet is <i>itself</i> &quot;critical infrastructure&quot;, and is the hardest thing to make secure (just witness the spread of NTP-based DDoS attacks). Having citadels of security in a floating maelstrom of unprotected Internet is not security at the national level.<p>> I believe that having an international net greatly helps in preventing wars by building relations between entities in different countries and spreading culture. Let&#x27;s not forget about the negative effects that would come from shutting this system down by introducing country-nets.<p>Well a counterargument is that an international net has allowed smart propaganda arms from all sources to drum up more hatred for America (I&#x27;m not speaking merely of things America deserves and should receive blame for.... e.g. both sides in Egypt blamed America and thought America was supporting the other). To be clear, neither the U.S. media or government has managed to engage in &quot;smart&quot; propaganda since the Cold War and the Internet has made the USG in particular look flat-footed.<p>Look around the Internet and all I see is Europeans calling us fat, making fun of how we measure distance, write and speak our dates (and all this despite American coders at MS being careful to add locale and translation support to their software), and more or less begging for us to take any overseas extension we have back to America.<p>While I will say that I do prefer an international, open network just as you do, those demanding America to go home may yet get their wish......",1392572139

Even if I were, how does that equate to &quot;angry with the world&quot;?<p>> The goal that RMS has been striving for are: The users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.<p>I&#x27;m well aware of his stated goals.<p>> BSD or MIT provides software to anyone, including people who use it for good, and people who use it for bad.<p>&quot;use it for bad&quot; - if the thing they want to do is so bad, why would they be bothered about breaking a license in the first place? Let&#x27;s come back tot hat later.<p>> non-profit aid organizations try to provided money to extremely poor people. Their goal is to help people not starve to death and help improve their lives. However, they do not want their money to go to criminals, thieves, and drug cartels as that would hurt their overarching goal.<p>Ok so first off. You just compared a HUGE community of software developers who use BSD/MIT licences, to drug cartels and thieves. Seriously? Besides the ridiculousness of the comparison, its downright fucking insulting.<p>A better comparison would be a charity run by a church group, that puts its idealogical belief system before the goal of raising more money for the poor. This actually happened in Australia a few years ago. Basically, the Salvation Army complained because a song given freely by a comedian for a Christmas CD (to generate funds for them to use to, you know, help the poor) makes lighthearted jokes about christianity (i.e. saying he doesn&#x27;t believe jesus is magical).<p>This is no different than RMS (through the GPL) alienating hundreds if not thousands of companies who are willing to contribute to open source efforts, but also expect to be able to viably sell a product based on said code.<p>RMS goal is explicitly <i></i>not<i></i> &quot;better code&quot;. If I wrote a 100% compatible alternative to GCC tomorrow, that produced 500% more efficient binaries, with a 200% speed increase in compile time, but released it under the BSD license, RMS would say &quot;we can&#x27;t use this&quot; - not because its not better. Because someone else might ALSO take that product, package it up somehow, and make money from people willing to pay for it. Does that other product prevent him from using the original? No. Does it prevent me, the original author from using, improving, or even making money from the original product? No.<p>I&#x27;m not telling you that you shouldn&#x27;t use the GPL license. Not at all. If you feel its right for you do that. I&#x27;m saying don&#x27;t get on some high fucking horse telling people who choose not to use GPL, that what they&#x27;re doing is &quot;wrong&quot; (either directly or indirectly, or via comparison to thieves, drug cartels and other criminals) because it doesn&#x27;t fit with your specific ideology.",1392570785

For example, you could easily set up an ad-hoc wifi network in a college dorm for, say, file sharing purposes. But in most other settings, I don&#x27;t get how it could work. Most people don&#x27;t even talk to their neighbors, so even if you lived in a neighborhood that had a high enough density of nodes for this to work, why would you want to share a little ad-hoc network with your neighbors?<p>Of course, wireless networks alone aren&#x27;t going to be sufficient to build a large-scale mesh network that could disrupt existing ISPs. The latency alone makes this infeasible. So you need someone to invest in physical links, especially physical links that cover long distances. That&#x27;s why the BTC part of this proposal is so great -- it provides a way to compensate these people. Of course, this is just a slightly different problem than the one we have today, but instead of being stuck with Comcast we&#x27;re stuck with whoever runs these physical links.",1392570296

3903907,comment,3903694,3903840,2,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Short-term capital gains are already taxed at income rates. Long-term capital gains are lower in part because they are not inflation protected, which can substantially discount the real returns. Having a lower tax rate is simpler than computing inflation-adjusted returns for every long-term transaction. For example, if you buy an asset for $500k and sell it for $600k ten years later, you actually lost money after adjusting for inflation but you still have to pay taxes on the $100k capital gain.<p>Another factor is that long-term capital gains taxes are much less efficient than income taxes in terms of adverse impact on the economy. If you need to raise additional revenue, it is better for economic growth to take it from income (or sales) than capital gains.",1335642989

3903893,comment,3900711,3903082,5,0,kafkaesque,,,"Hm. There is quite a bit of misinformation (I like to think it was done unintentionally) that your comment caused when people replied to you. The biggest one being that the US 'invented' 'electronic dance music'.<p>I can sit here and write an overly, but necessary long reply or recommend a couple of books. I'll do the latter, all of them by Simon Reynolds: Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture; Retromania: Pop Culture's Addiction to Its Own Past.<p>Music history is filled with ambiguities and nebulous, complex definitions that have changed throughout history. What's more, how electronic dance music got from point A to B to C to D to E, and so on and so forth, usually sounds unintuitive to people who listen to mostly only very few music styles.  A linear and extremely compressed timeline of electronic (dance) music can probably start as early as Kraftwerk in the early 70s, then NEU! and a lot of so-called 'krautrock', which morphed into things such as Joy Division, who is said to have influenced rave/club culture. Interestingly, the word 'rave' is actually 1960s British slang for modern day-like, club-like loud parties. These loans (both linguistically and musically from all periods in time) remain very common across all of music and makes it even more complex to explain. Anyway, the whole Hacienda club scene influenced club music in the 80s, especially when Ian Curtis died and New Order adopted a sound that allegedly Curtis had already thought of in the late 70s. The Human League shares a somewhat similar music development in the sense that early Human League incorporated more 'rock' elements with 'electronic' ones, and then mostly switched to pure 'electronic' elements. With the help of hip hop (borrowing and sampling music to form their own music), a type of 'explosion' in electronic music occurred. There were some artists already making electronic dance music but it hit mainstream in the early 80s when hip hop started sampling from other artists and using non-traditional (for that time) ways of making music with electronic equipment.<p>You get bands such as Duran Duran to DJs 'mixing' to, basically, C+C Music Factory. Then comes probably the epitome of rave and electronic dance music: UK garage, dnb, 2-step, jungle, etc.; that all-encompassing term 'rave music'. This is probably when every type of electronic and electronic dance music was created and the rest is history.<p>See, the problem is that by the 80s, electronic dance music had already been invented and various locations took those ideas at the same time, so people sometimes emphasise New York (electro), Chicago or Detroit (house), and at the point the music from these places 'sounded' more like what we relate to 'house music' now, many other places (in the UK, especially) were doing the same thing. If we look back at Chicago and Detroit before this time, they still had house, but it sounded like funk or disco or dance music with upgraded gear. In other words, it was funk, disco, or dance music using more electronic sounding equipment that we now equate to an '80s sound'. It wasn't electronic music using dance elements. It was dance music using electronic elements.<p>The funny thing about the States is that in the 90s, electronic music switched to a mainstream emphasis. There were still raves in the States, interesting DJs, and a thriving club scene, but it was underground. The American 90s were characterized by the rise of underground 'indie music'/'rock'/'grunge'/'alternative' music. As much as I hate to admit it (because I don't like them), but Nirvana is a good example of this, as are bands such as Pavement, Sonic Youth, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains.<p>If that makes sense.",1335642709

3903880,comment,3902697,3903825,6,0,arjunnarayan,,,"This is a very good quersion, and made me think a little. Here's my stab at it:<p>If we define the shortage as ""shortage of people willing to do X for $200,000 a year"", that's clearly a bad definition. You should just pay more (as earl suggested) to get what you want. But what if that's just not possible on a macro level?<p>Consider if you have an aggregate demand of ""the market needs a total of 500 Data scientists"". If there are only 250 data scientists in the world, their salaries will be bid up, then I can see somebody crying that there's a shortage for affordable data scientists (whatever that means). But any capitalist will tell you that they're just looking for a free sailboat. On the other hand, the 250 data scientists are being paid a lot, and on some level skills are somewhat fungible, so you end up with non-data scientists (maybe vanilla statisticians/actuaries) moving sideways to get in on this payday. So you have some retraining, and in the long run things tend to work out. So there's no shortage.<p>But in the long run we are all dead. Thus even if we define a shortage as the shortfall in supply at _any_ price, this isn't sufficient. In the short run there can very well be a shortfall.<p>If it takes 3 years to train a data scientist (I'm just making stuff up here), and there are 250 data scientists on the market, if you have an aggregate demand for 500 data scientists _today_ --- completely price unconditional --- you just cannot fill it. Price is almost irrelevant (on the macro level --- you as an individual can always outbid your competitors). There is a temporal shortage that cannot be filled.<p>I think this is the precise definition of what a shortage is that you are looking for. Shortages exist in the macro scale. Shortages do not exist for individual companies (they should just pay more, and if the benefits are not worth the cost of hiring, there isn't a shortage, they're just cheap).",1335642462

The Swedish academy gave another round of Gaussian-based Nobel Prizes to Myron Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who had improved on an old mathematical formula and made it compatible with the existing grand Gaussian general financial equilibrium theorieshence acceptable to the economics establishment. The formula was now useable. It had a list of long forgotten precursors, among whom was the mathematician and gambler Ed Thorp, who had authored the bestselling Beat the Dealer, about how to get ahead in blackjack, but somehow people believe that Scholes and Merton invented it, when in fact they just made it acceptable. The formula was my bread and butter. Traders, bottom-up people, know its wrinkles better than academics by dint of spending their nights worrying about their risks, except that few of them could express their ideas in technical terms, so I felt I was representing them. Scholes and Merton made the formula dependent on the Gaussian, but their precursors subjected it to no such restriction. /.../<p>> And the option formula went on bearing the name Black-Scholes-Merton, instead of reverting to its true owners, Louis Bachelier, Ed Thorp, and others.",1335641776

Tax laws are subject to regulatory competition like many other things, and ignoring that -- insisting that this is an issue of morality or fairness -- is silly.<p>If the US had a globally competitive corporate tax rate (say 15%), it would make most of these tactics irrelevant. There's no need to shelter income in Ireland if they have the same tax rates. Because of the reduced sheltering, such a reform would probably raise revenue on net. But even if it didn't, it would have many ancillary benefits, such as repatriating many billions of dollars in corporate profits and increasing the degree to which they are deployed in the US, which would far exceed the costs.<p>Even better would be to reduce corporate income tax to 0% and increase dividend and capital gains rates to personal-income-tax levels to make up for it. The main reason dividend income is treated preferentially in the US is that corporate profits are already being taxed (in theory). Those multi-level nature of the US tax code creates unnecessary loopholes, as well as costs and confusion. Counter-intuitively, eliminating the corporate income tax would make it much easier to tax corporate income, because those profits <i>necessarily</i> flow back to investors either in the form of dividends or capital gains. If you are a resident of the US (and california) and you own 1 apple share, you pay taxes on your share of Apple's income. Even better, it would be progressive. Rich people pay more, poorer people pay less.<p>Simple, right?",1335641615
3903839,comment,3902319,3903244,2,0,simonster,,,"I thought about this a little bit, and I don't think this would be very trivial. CoffeeScript is designed to map easily onto JavaScript. A transcompiler that compiles JavaScript with matrix extensions to performant plain JavaScript would likely be significantly more complex than the CoffeeScript transcompiler.<p>Consider that you want to translate the matrix operation A * B into A.times(B). You have two options:<p>1) Figure out what's a matrix before runtime, using static type inference.\n2) Translate the code into JavaScript that determines whether to treat the code as a matrix at runtime.<p>In the first case, you don't need a JIT at all. JITs exist largely because you can't do perfect type inference in dynamic languages. If you can do perfect type inference on all acceptable code (a la RPython), or if you require type annotations, you can compile straight to C or machine code.<p>In the second case, you take a speed hit of 25-50% on scalar operations for the guard, at least in modern versions of SpiderMonkey and V8 (see <a href=""http://jsperf.com/cost-of-multiplication-via-function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/cost-of-multiplication-via-function</a>).<p>You can probably get acceptable performance out of combining static type inference with guards. My understanding is that this is what SpiderMonkey does internally. But at this point, it might be easier to integrate your functionality into an existing JIT than to write your transcompiler with type inference, particularly since you will have to implement matrix and vector ops inside the JS engine to achieve acceptable performance anyway.",1335641598

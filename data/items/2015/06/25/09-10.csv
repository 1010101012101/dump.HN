I saw Huginn, https://github.com/cantino/huginn/, and I think that could be used to build something like Pipes, but it is not the same and does not have the feed focus. IFTTT can only do one thing - send you emails when something occurs in a feed. There are a bunch of other projects that look a lot like IFTTT, but that is not what I search for. I looked at zapier, elastic.io - they are app focused, not feed focused.<p>I&#x27;m asking because I thought a lot about how to build something like Yahoo Pipes - yesterday I realized that a pipe it is a graph of blocks where the root is the pipe output, and not that the feed inputs are the roots. Very early alpha code is there.<p>I think the open web needs some kind of infrastructure to manipulate feeds. But I wouldn&#x27;t mind not really building it if there is already something.",1435226338

The author looks to be coming down fairly heavily on the side of hiring people instead of using subcontractors. In the article&#x27;s defense, it does present some of the other side of the argument -- later on in the piece.<p>I think this is all going to shake out over the next five years or so, with these markets bifurcating into a more expensive model using employees, and a less expensive model using contractors. Each will have benefits and drawbacks.<p>I couldn&#x27;t help but think of a recent interview with one of the LinkedIn founders I read recently. As you know, LinkedIn facilitates a lot of recruiting -- and poaching -- across many industries. The writer asked the founder how, since he saw the massive churn in IT, did he go about hiring people?<p>His response was golden: as part of their hiring and employee management process, it&#x27;s made clear that any full-time job is probably temporary. So there are clear goals that both the company and employee have for growth in order to reach their next level. The employee might want to work in several new technologies and gather up some skills they are missing. The company may want to enter a high-risk, high-stress market to see if there&#x27;s a business model there. Everybody gets something they want and the relationship is understood to both be temporary and mutually-beneficial.<p>I like this. This is the model I use when assembling and managing technology teams, and it&#x27;s the model I&#x27;ve seen work over and over again. Quite frankly it&#x27;s the only model I can see working in a rapidly-changing economy. The real question is how you apply this model to more mundane service-oriented industries like Uber.",1435225746

This is no different to me sending you an attachment over email in some proprietary vendor-specific format (e.g. .ppt) which obliges you to install PowerPoint to read it.<p>This can be used for both good and evil.  The evil scenario is above - rather than using an open standard like ODF, it provides a route to promote vendor lock-in.  The good scenario is that it provides extensibility for technology that simply isn&#x27;t standardised yet, and gives vendors a way to differentiate their product.  For instance, if Oculus jumped on Matrix and started using it to negotiate VR collaboration spaces, it almost certainly wouldn&#x27;t work with any other vendor at first... but it&#x27;s good news for end-users who get a cool feature which some day may be standardised across all of Matrix.<p>The bottom line is that as long as everyone implements the common base line use cases in an interoperable fashion (i.e. IM and VoIP), then vendors having freedom to put proprietary/experimental stuff on top is just a necessary evil... <i>as long as they don&#x27;t break the baseline</i>.  It&#x27;s up to us as consumers to then encourage vendors to make their extensions standards rather than exploit them for vendor-lockin.

Meanwhile we&#x27;re currently replacing the example Matrix Angular webapp with a Matrix React webapp which will improve the performance enormously.<p>In terms of polished UI/UX, we were hoping the community would fork the example apps and put the necessary polish and usability on them.  Features should (almost) all be there, and we&#x27;re doing our best on platform ubiquity.<p>However, as ex3ndr&#x27;s comment below shows, there are people still creating their own per-app proprietary protocols rather than building on something like Matrix.<p>So in order to help bootstrap Matrix, am sure we&#x27;ll end up building a killer client app sooner or later if nobody else does :)",1435223230

Not trying to minimize what you&#x27;re saying -- But I am genuinely curious as to how you&#x27;d test such a vast code-base written by so many different people for security issue?<p>e.g. how will 1.0 be any more secure than alpha aside from developers having more time to &quot;run into&quot; the security issues by sheer luck/accident?<p>Maybe someone vet the code by hand -- or maybe they will use a security testing suite to automate it? If so, wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to do that before accepting code that could potentially introduce security bugs?",1435223168

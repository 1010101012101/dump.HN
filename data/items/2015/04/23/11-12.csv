There&#x27;ll be software engineers who write code that interfaces with hardware and other software APIs. The languages will change, the ideas might change, but the jobs will still exist.<p>What will <i>really</i> change is the sophistication of people who interact with software - the end user. They&#x27;ll start writing code (within the confines of an application suite) in a big way. At the moment I imagine only a single digit percentage of users can write a macro or use a scripting language in an application, but that will change <i>immensely</i>. Everyone will use &#x27;code&#x27; to manipulate data in their job. There will be a fundamental shift towards understanding things on an abstract &#x27;everything is just data&#x27; level. The real question is whether that&#x27;s 100 years away or 20 years away. I suspect it&#x27;s going to be <i>much</i> closer to 20.",1429790374

So why not just add a brief MIT license [1] to your code, painlessly clarifying your legal stance?<p>Because that does not clarify my legal stance at all. My legal stance is that code does/can/should not have a license and that no license is necessary to use any code.

While some genes expressing differently will present clear dysgenic properties, others may not evince until much later in life - or perhaps even in subsequent generations, by altering gametes or epigenetic in-utero signalling or whatnot in unanticipated ways.<p>Yes, we can do epidemiological statistical studies to understand what individual genes affect, yes, we can do this for combinations of genes - but we can&#x27;t study the affect of genes on subsequent generations, apart from in drosophila studies and what-not - which frequently end up demonstrating that yes, these edits do have unanticipated affects a dozen generations down the line, particularly when multiply crossed with other variants, and random mutations.<p>If human genome tinkering ends up common place, we will end up either with strict reproductive controls, or we will end up reproducing through cloning, and our evolution becomes entirely self-driven. The alternatives are likely just too dangerous.<p>Edit: sorry, forgot one of my points. Right now, we rely on statistical studies to understand what parts of the genome do. This could be remedied by having adequate computational power and models to actually simulate an organism from the molecular level up. Only then will we actually have some degree of control, and <i>true</i> understanding of what we are doing.",1429790151

9426059,comment,9424654,9424654,0,0,lfds-admin,,,"To answer various questions people have asked and to make one or two notes of my own;<p>1. The current version of the library contains a profound design flaw - it allocates memory.  This is not viable in any way.  The next release (which is very close to completion, but has been deferred for the last month due to a crisis project at work) does not.  Regarding ConcurrencyKit, it is an excellent project, and I know Samy (I was involved in him getting his last job); he is an excellent programmer.  He said to me about four years ago I needed to make a new release :-)<p>2. Regarding ABA and memory reclaimation.  There is a comment noting that it is hard to find this information in the docs.  I apologise.  It is indeed not particularly explained.  The docs were written with a view to a non-lock-free informed user wishing to use the API, so technical information regarding the internal implementation is lacking.  In the current release ABA is resolved by the use of DCAS (limiting the library to ARM and Intel), and there is no memory reclaimation.  In the next release, memory reclaimation has been implemented (removing the limit of ARM and Intel).  I also implemented on ARM LL/SC versions of the algorithms, but these have been removed, because it&#x27;s too hard to know which platforms they will or will not work on.  ARM is still supported of course, but by using LL/SC to emulate CAS.<p>3. The blog, ah, yes.  It&#x27;s where I let off steam in the heat of frustration, which is off course not always pleasent - however, it&#x27;s nice to vent.  I am thinking of getting rid of it though, because it&#x27;s not very professional.<p>4. The reason for a new github repo on each release, and the naming strategy, is to permit the concurrent use of multiple releases of the library.  By allowing a new release to be used in parallel with old releases, existing code does not have to be modified.  This minimizes work and risk.  For minor releases and bug releases, where APIs do not change, a global search and replace will permit a full change to the new version.<p>5. Regarding frames.  The site uses a number of third-party applications, such as a forum and a blog.  These all emit HTML which assumes they are generating the whole page - they have a <HTML> tag in their output.  Their output then has to exist in a frame.  If I capture it and send it to a DIV, the DIV renders incorrectly.<p>Finally, please note the forum (which is fairly new) needs to be upgraded to reduce spam attacks (I&#x27;ve been too busy to do so).  Currently I see hundreds of attempts each day, by robots, to generate accounts and so it is impractical to continually scan the lists of requests to find any real requests.  The forum does now offer a captch for this, and as soon as I get time (one or two weeks) I will upgrade to this.",1429790092

However, this implies the I agree with and abide by the notion of licensing as it exists today.  This is not quite the case.  I think property rights are correct, but I think freedom (all contracts must be voluntary and well-informed, except in self-defence) is correct, and so the situation as it stands, where other people decide the law regarding licensing <i>and we have no choice but to adhere to it</i>, this is unethical.<p>Be clear here - it is not so much the <i>purpose</i> of licensing which I disagree with (for it fairly closely implements property rights, which I profoundly agree with) but rather the method of implementation - there is a single set of law, decided by others, and we have to obey that law.  This violates my idea of freedom.<p>So with regard to the licensing text on the library, I am attempting to meet the legal needs of users by giving them a carte blanche; they can <i>know</i> their (reasonable, sane) licensing needs will be met, and this I hope simply removes the issue as far as they are concerned, while honouring my ethical views.",1429788965

9425934,comment,9424328,9424328,0,0,EGreg,,,"In the Qbix Platform (<a href=""http://platform.qbix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://platform.qbix.com</a>) the default type of data is a Stream. A Stream is published by a User and one or more Users can be Invited and Participate. Streams are supposed be of different &quot;types&quot; and support posting Messages of different types. The multicasting of messages to participants who are online via sockets is handled by the pltform. Participants who are offline can maintain Subcriptions and receive offline Notifications to their native app on a device (iOS, Android, Mac) or email or sms or facebook. In addition there is Access control which specifies access to the Public as well as individual users and by Labels (like roles, but labels on contacts of the publishng User). Users can be either people or organizations.<p>The whole thing is supposed to &quot;just work&quot; and, at version 0.8, it pretty much does, stably. But we still have a lot to do.<p>The reason we chose this is because it supports everything from updating your status / location / whatever to chatrooms and collaborative documents. A chess game is just a stream of type &quot;Chess/game&quot; which supports messages like &quot;Chess/move&quot; and &quot;Chess/resign&quot;.<p>All the developer has to do is implement their stream type, or &quot;tools&quot; (components) to interact with the stream or &quot;preview&quot; it in listings. We provide typical tools such as &quot;Streams/related&quot; which automatically handles showing streams related to some given stream, and can update in realtime, allow creation of more streams, etc. The developer would jst handle incoming messages and process their effects. Also sometimes a stream might Refresh because the user, say, came back to a mobile app after it was suspended in the background. In this case the stream player or preview gets the latest state instead of &quot;replaying&quot; what would potentially be 100s of messages. And the whole page doesnt need to be reloaded. It all works already.<p>Now we are working on Offline streams. For example, a stream that has been created offline isn&#x27;t shared with anyone so no one else can write to it. This means we ca handle all the persistence on the client and sync it later, when the client connects.<p>We do not attempt to solve issues via &quot;heuristic&quot; diff based sync algorithms. Instead, the source of truth is the Publishing User&#x27;s server and it is also the source of chronological order of the messages. The developer never has to worry about messages arriving out of order, or something else, just use the JS API. In addition, we handle the CAP theorem by requiring consistency only per stream. If one message contains (hashed) info from another message on some other strean, we know it was posted later (like bitcoin).<p>In the end we plan to make this platform completely distributed and power social layer for the web like wordpress powers blogs.<p>So that&#x27;s how wedo it!",1429787994

I wanted to build a new kind of hardware product, one where the lead time of tooling and manufacturing could be cut out, at least for the kit version, I plan a full normal manufacturing process as well. So building was us eating our own dog food.<p>It&#x27;s an experiment to see if the RepRap model can be extended to other areas. It&#x27;s an experiment to see if 3D printers can live up to their hype. The hype is incomplete, as small plastic parts are only so useful. But I think plastic parts in combination with circuit boards, arduinos, laser cut wood parts and commodity manufactured parts is incredibly powerful.<p>This was my thinking on building vs buying a 3D printer when I made the decison:<p>I needed a large build area, and so the 12&quot; Prusa for $650 seemed a good choice, compared to a $1300 Solidoodle that I read bad reviews of, saying that it did not work well, or a $2000+ Makerbot that I just did not have the money for on my bootstrapping budget.<p>When I bought the kit the seller advertised a build time of 3+ hours. I thought that&#x27;s nothing, we can do it in one or two evenings and it won&#x27;t set us back at all. It took much longer, but what really took time was the fine calibration and the learning curve of designing 3D parts that are able to be printed one layer at a time.<p>The instructional videos were  outdated in many places, on older iterations of the kit. We had a heated bed short out, and we had no experience with RepRaps. The parts didn&#x27;t come labelled and just figuring out what was what took a while. I didn&#x27;t realize until the end that Colin at MakerFarm provides heroic, incredibly responsive email support and so many of the questions that stumped us for a while could have been answered almost instantaneously with a quick email.<p>Despite that, Makerfarm still makes a really great RepRap kit that I highly recommend and Colin is seriously a standup guy that replaced the shorted out heated bed for free.<p>I considered farming the parts out, but knew I would need to print multiple iterations and I would not get it right on the first or second or third attempts and it would slow down our OODA loop.<p>I can&#x27;t wait to show the world what we have been doing but we are just not quite ready yet, still in super secret g14 classified startup mode.",1429787279

Free WiFi is standard, most cafes serve a decent breakfast for less than $2, and many of them are quite elegant and beautifully appointed. The biggest downside is that <i>everybody</i> smokes here so if you&#x27;re sensitive to cigarette smoke you might have a hard time finding a seat that isn&#x27;t close to a smoker.",1429786997

Even worse, under certain conditions, we managed to get devices into a repeatable reboot cycle, rendering them useless.</i><p>So it only crashed the whole device if the device was under &#x27;heavy use&#x27;, which seems to contradict the claim that it renders devices unusable immediately.",1429786976

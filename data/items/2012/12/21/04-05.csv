4951554,comment,4950623,4951352,2,0,laughinghan,,,"<i>When I was just starting, everyone screamed about pure ""semantic"" markup and how all css class names should describe what was contained in a node, and have nothing to do with how it was presented. [...] A few years later and that roar is gone. Bootstrap.css for everything, with class names that describe structure. [...] the absolute 180 without even a hint of the old battle cry in the air is startling.</i><p>I don't think a single advocate of semantic CSS class names has changed their mind and now says there are no problems with using Bootstrap presentational CSS class names in your HTML. Just yesterday, on the front page of Hacker News, there was an article about the pain caused by overuse of Boostrap's unsemantic CSS class names: <a href=""http://blog.pamelafox.org/2012/12/a-tale-of-two-bootstraps-lessons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.pamelafox.org/2012/12/a-tale-of-two-bootstraps-l...</a><p>I don't know why you ever thought people were ""screaming"" about it, but if you're hearing about it less than about Bootstrap now, it's definitely from different people.<p>There are objective benefits for maintainability by designing your HTTP APIs to be RESTful, just as there are objective benefits for maintainability by choosing your CSS class names to be semantic, and they have been espoused by the creators of HTTP and CSS since their creation. It is neither ""mania"" nor ""crazy"".<p>Your child-like conversation with an unhelpful strawman notwithstanding, it is true that in the real world, software architecture always has to balance long-term maintainability against short-term ease of implementation. That doesn't change the fact that semantic CSS class names and RESTful APIs improve maintainability, always have, always will, people always have said they do, and people always will say they do.",1356065939

4951542,comment,4951364,4951364,2,0,vitovito,,,"This is an interesting question, but I don't know how many file format neckbeards you're going to find on HN, it's an awfully young community.  Maybe Stack Overflow?  Maybe the File Formats wiki[1] will have links to format inventors?  Maybe read the specs for the formats and ask the authors, as well as the authors of standard libraries for them?<p>1: <a href=""http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Electronic_File_Formats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Electronic_File_Form...</a><p>I will answer what little I can based on some work I did in 2005-2006 that resulted in me abusing JPEG restart markers.<p>1. Part of the reason PNG is chunked is because it's designed for network use (that's the N), where you can lose or corrupt a portion of the file and still get most of the file usable.  That's what JPEG restart markers are for: you can repeat the headers throughout the file (rather than CRC throughout the file) so if something in the middle gets messed up, you can always pick right back up.  Formats expected to sit on a disk and never move and trust rotational media don't have those checks because it's assumed you check it when you write it and then you're fine for a reasonable value of forever.  So: are you transferring over a network constantly like you do with JPEGs and PNGs, or can you do an MD5 sum (or whatever) once and be done with it?<p>1b. I don't know what these words mean.<p>1c. This should be answered by 1.<p>2. This is probably explained somewhere in the PNG spec or the PNG mailing list archives, but specifying the length of a run of data instead of looping until you find a \0 helps you optimize and prevents buffer overflows.<p>3. Yes, lots of things use user-defined chunks and all sorts of crazy stuff gets stored in them.  A video game once stored its character data as PNG files with custom chunks so you could put them online as images, and then right-click-save-as and import them into the game.  But no, most software doesn't understand other chunks and ignores them (but preserves them).",1356065669

There are a variety of focus and window ordering issues. Coming back from sleep each one has different display twitches; nothing worse than the usual Linux user contempt, but definitely unpolished. The Unity stuff is going in a good direction but I don't think they've been doing a ton of user testing; it also frequently feels clunky to me. Network Manager is slow to find networks and regularly crashes. Device support is so-so: the Android tethering that is support to magically work never does; plugging in a phone or a tablet frequently requires command-line incantations and is often buggy. One of my devices has a touch-screen; a minor kernel upgrade broke this a couple months back, and it is still broken.<p>I think they're right to go for a better UI experience, but right now I think they're in a valley between the solid but ugly Linux experience I was used to and the solid but friendly experience that Apple has inspired them to pursue.

I did network administration for a number of title companies, mortgage lenders, real-estate agents, and other assorted firms involved in the selling and buying of houses between 2004 and 2011. Most of these people were what you would consider hard working honest employees, but due to perverse incentives helped in their part of making all of this worse. I saw plenty of lenders have the client flat out lie about their income. It didn't seem to matter, the banks rarely rejected the loans if the paper looked good. The better you lied, the more sales you got. If you were totally honest, people heard that it was hard to get a loan or closure from your firm and would head to others. At the time there was seemly no risk, it wasn't till after the financial crash that I heard of any arrests over paper manipulation. The problem is the people that have the data now are going to be very shy about releasing it. It will show fraud by the buyers, possible fraud by the lenders, poor research by the big banks. By the time the crash came it was a game. Interest only loans? You've got to be kidding me.<p>At a murder scene, evidence is how one determines the cause and the killer, but if your killer has means he can manipulate that evidence.

It's oversimplified because IV is now in a position to pursue multiple patent strategies, including ones that make great PR: ""Look, we're patenting the solution to malaria!""  But let's focus on how they got started, their ""bread and butter"", how they actually make money.<p>The term ""patent troll"" came from an in-house lawyer for a large well-known IT company.<p>The idea is that small inventors or small companies sometimes with the help of NPE's or aggressive litigators would come after the large companies and ask them to ""pay up"".<p>Of course the reality is often that large companies are the only ones who are capable of practising the technology in these patents and actually producing products and services that people use.  So to the large company with lots of cash, these threats are just trolling.  The small guys, the NPE's and aggressive patent litigators trying to shake down the large companies don't produce anything.  All they did was file receive a few (likely bogus) software patents.  They are ""patent trolls"".<p>Now, obviously the definition has expanded, but now you know where it came from and the context.<p>Next an ex-MS CTO with considerable personal wealth has become so bothered by this (or intrigued, take your pick) that he decides instead fo trying to fix the system and solve this problem of trolling, he will stick himself into the space that the NPE's and the aggressive patent litigators occupy.  He will be a middleman.  The new middleman.  One middleman to rule them all.  And he will take his cut.  They'll be no need to produce products.  Of course, there's one problem with this idea.  He does not have control of 100's or 1000's of patents.<p>Now, what nik seems to be missing is that no business is going to donate money or patents to an aspiring mega troll.\nLarge companies don't want to pay unless they have to; if there's no litigation threat then there's no reason to pay.  Small inventors, universities, NPE's, etc. OTOH want payment; they are not going to donate their patents into a trolling pool without cash up front or some guarantee of payment.  And as for VC, at the time, they had better things to invest in, and still do.  One could argue they like the small guy with a great story and huge potential, not some tax collector on innovation that is by and large just a group of patent lawyers with no intention of producing anything.<p>_Our mega troll had to use his own money to get this idea off the ground._  He had to create a threat, a pool of patents that would otherwise be worthless on their own, by spending _his own money._ If this is such a savvy business idea then why did he have to take on the risk personally?  And why isn't every wealthy geek jumping on the bandwagon and launching an IV clone?  Why bother making products?  Why not just be a middleman that produces nothing?  I'll leave those questions for the reader.  Here's a hint: Because no one, other than the trolls themselves, wanted to exacerbate an already vexing problem.<p>Of course, to the troll, the system is not broken.  To the troll bogus software patents are currency.  The only problem the troll has is getting people to pay for his worthless patents; our mega troll does this only by aggregating them into an impenetrable thicket (much larger and broader than any previsouly existing NPE) of remote potential infringement suits and hiding behind ephemeral shell corporations.  It's worthless currency that would otherwise be ignored by anyone producing products and offering services (as his former employer routinely did), unless you threaten to sue them.<p>As with the software bug analogy in an above comment, what the IV founder did was to become part of the problem, inserting himself into the chain of contributors, in order to profit from it.",1356062453

2241367,comment,2241174,2241174,0,0,shiftb,,,"How it worked last year:<p>- Internet: We had 3 Sprint wifi hotspots on the bus. You could connect to any of them, but if one started to get overloaded it definitely slowed down. California, Arizona, and Texas were fine, but Sprint seems to be unaware of New Mexico's existence. I had a Verizon Palm Pre and I used the mobile hotspot a lot. I know a couple others did similar things.<p>- Server: We didn't have an on-bus server. The internet was reliable enough to download things like jquery locally and do all the dev locally. Since my team used git we had an easy time pushing and pulling code from each other even when the internet was spotty. A couple of us are thinking about donating a laptop to run as an onboard server/git repo.",1298188572

This stuff is safe from Microsoft.<p>And that is only thing that is remotely safe. All other is murky. But unfortunately, even that can be unsafe if Microsoft sell patents to CPTN (like they did with Novell patents) and let them sue even for ECMA parts.<p>Moreover, ECMA parts are unusable on their own. Eevery single mono app also depends on non-ECMA parts and Mono is always shipped with non-ECMA parts: <a href=""http://www.the-source.com/2010/12/on-mono-packaging/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.the-source.com/2010/12/on-mono-packaging/</a><p>As for Estoppel, they didn't promise anything for non-ECMA. It doesn't work the way you think it works. In fact, they even promised to sue:<p>""If someone implemented a product that conforms to the specification, we believe we have a patent or one pending thatâ€™s essential to implementing the specification.""<p>or<p>""The .NET framework contains the latest developer platform for the future, and it must be licensed like Windows.

The GPL is for the former, while the WTFPL is for the latter.<p>Regarding practicality, RMS claims that the GPL forces companies to open-source software that would otherwise by proprietary, thus opening up the information contained within to everyone, for their use and improvement.

The phrase 'maximize freedom' is meaningless without context, too many freedoms are contradictory.<p>It <i>is</i> freedom as in speech, because it is the freedom for users of code to take that code and use it to express their own ideas, and to redistribute that expression to their friends and anyone else who may be interested.  
In that context, code is <i>literally</i> a form of speech, and the software an expression of an idea.
Under the freedoms provided by something like the GPL I can take someone else's idea, change it to suit myself and redistribute that change.<p>The GPL clearly does not attempt to maximize the freedom of developers or distributors who wish to deny end users the freedoms that the GPL provides.<p>Again, this is ground that seems to be covered over and over. 
It is hard for me to believe that someone like you, who is clearly intelligent, has clearly thought about the subject and discussed it previously, has truly never had it explained to them, or has entirely failed to understand the distinction.

Since we now have a free kernel that works, namely Linux[-libre], it's no longer essential to develop the Hurd.

An iPhone out of the box can't do very much, you add apps to get more functionality. You do know that someone has to develop those apps, right? Having more of the platform liberated allows for developers to take more advantage of the platform, meaning more apps, more advanced apps, and easier proliferation of those apps and features across different hardware. Also, an Android phone will be the first to be quad-core powered. Know how hard Apple would have to work to get that to work on an iPhone?

I'm always making last-minute copy changes, and sometimes would make a change like this to ""You are logged in"". It's a very simple change, but potentially could break some specs. I'd have to run the suite, see what failed, look at the line numbers, figure out why, then realize it wasn't that my app wasn't functioning properly, but the assertion was tied very closely to a transient message.

In other words, no one wants to believe that men in America could think/act in such a backwards way so they are more likely to pin the blame on the men in an attempt to say, ""See! Those guys are the outliers!"" On the other hand, they view the Middle East in general as a 'dangerous place' that is 10x more dangerous when you're a woman, so the compulsion is to ask, ""Why were you even putting yourself in that dangerous position?"" (effectively placing the blame on the victim)<p>I'm not stating that the above is right, but that's my take on why it happens.",1298186643

Seriously, and I hear he swings my way too.<p>There are many ways to innovate in business and technology and design get a lot of time in the spotlight.<p>Operations, especially of a very large enterprise, with thousands of suppliers which also demands highly precise manufacturing and quality control, while having operations spread around the globe, and a public awareness factor that makes it vulnerable to any ""Watchdog"" who wants to make news... running a less-than-30-days-inventory system is playing on the Nth level.<p>Can anyone name anybody who has done something like that?  Amazon's distribution network is a lot easier, as they control all the infrastructure.  Dell doesn't have the volume or quality requirements or focused product lineup (which reduces substitution- eg: if dell is out of a particular laptop model, they have others to substitute, apple doesn't have that luxury.)<p>It is no wonder Apple is doing long term contracts for supplies like this.<p>Some have accused them of cornering the market, but this is not like cornering the market on Silver (look up Hunt Brothers) -- as anyone with reasonable technology can make a substitute for electronics components which are fungible commodities for the most part.<p>This is just good management of a very sophisticated manufacturing network.<p>Dude deserves and Oscar in Operations!",1298186582

(Engadet had to shut down their commenting system for a few days due to all the vitriol)<p>Also, I think you're missing the point on pricing. It really hurts Motorola that there isn't a low end model at $499, because there are a lot of non-technical users for whom 16GB is perfectly adequate.

Cadets and Midshipmen at our service academies have always been required to participate in athletics because team sports develop leadership, teamwork, and tactical and strategic thinking (in the '30s through the '60s, the service academies were powerhouses in college football).  Academy graduates were a minority of overall officers in the war, but were a majority of the most senior officers.

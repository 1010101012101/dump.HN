I look around for something really good, when I find something I like I then take the laptop out of my bag and I look up the book at Amazon. Quite often one of Amazons recommendations ends up being more interesting to me, so at that point I'll use my mobile to call a smaller, independent bookstore and special order the book. In the several days it takes to arrive I usually just read the same blogs you guys already mentioned.",1219445819

""As a hypothetical example, take the University of Pennsylvania and Penn State, which are two schools a lot of students choose between,"" Krueger said. ""One is Ivy, one is a state school. Penn is much more highly selective. If you compare the students who go to those two schools, the ones who go to Penn have higher incomes. But let's look at those who got into both types of schools, some of whom chose Penn and some of whom chose Penn State. Within that set it doesn't seem to matter whether you go to the more selective school. Now, you would think that the more ambitious student is the one who would choose to go to Penn, and the ones choosing to go to Penn State might be a little less confident in their abilities or have a little lower family income, and both of those factors would point to people doing worse later on.

284269,comment,283666,284191,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Oh, I'm sure there are differences between companies. However, your measure of ""people love working there"" might be misleading. All of my ex-colleagues loved working on games, and almost all were pretty happy at the company, because, you know, the previous company they worked for had <i>worse</i> death marches - 7 days a week, not 6! and from the start of the project, not just the last year of development! - and wow, our company paid up to GBP 7.50 for takeaway dinners when you worked more than 11 hours that day! Plus, the previous company went out of business and didn't pay the last 3 months of salary, whereas this one was still hanging on.<p>I don't know exactly how it happens, either that people talk themselves into being grateful for their situation, or they just drink enough game industry Kool-Aid to not see how it's completely broken.<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't regret working in games for a year - I'd almost certainly be wondering what professional game development was really like if I hadn't. I also don't know if the leap into self-employment had come so soon or at all if my quality of life had been better at some other job. In any case, I'm glad to have left that behind, and glad to have done it when I did.<p>Plus, I discovered I like programming more than I like game development, which means that I'm actually working on more fun and interesting stuff now - although my job at the time was tech/engine programming, most of it wasn't actually that challenging; I wasn't solving interesting problems. There's a lot of reinventing the wheel (and the bugfixing that goes with it) in the game industry...<p>Oh, and by the way: getting into game development as a competent programmer isn't nearly as hard as they like to make it out to be. (I was also involved with recruitment) I'm guessing they have to maintain that air of elitism to keep people interested. If you're itching to work on games, I'm not going to try and talk you out of it; you'll have to decide for yourself if that kind of life is for you.

284266,comment,284205,284205,0,0,smanek,,,"I think the salient issue with big name universities is selection bias. MIT gets to choose valedictorians with perfect SAT scores as its student body; is it any surprise that its students are more successful than a less selective university's?<p>The real question is how well would the students accepted to MIT but who chose to go to less selective schools do (not perfect data, but the best we can get from the real world). I'm personally inclined to believe they do just as well as those who actually attended MIT, but I don't have the data to know.<p>Interestingly, a similar issue comes into play with YC. A surprisingly high percentage of YC accepted companies are successful (for some definition of success), just like a surprisingly high percentage of ivy league grads are successful.<p>The real question is how much of that success is due to the fact that companies yc funds are intrinsically better than the rest of the field versus how much impact pg's help has. Maybe pg is just amazingly good at picking winners, and the companies he picks would have succeeded with or without his help.<p>The only way to get a better idea would be to compare the success rates of people accepted by yc who declined to those actually accepting yc's offer. This wouldn't even be a perfect measure though, since maybe there is some underlying factor (media savvy, proclivity to seek help, etc) that causes a company to both accept yc investment and succeed.<p>The only real way to tell would be to have pg randomly issue offers to half the companies he normally would, and compare the success of companies he issued offers to against those he would have but didn't issue offers to and a random selection of those he didn't plan to make offers to.<p>For obvious reasons that would be an impossible experiment to run. In this case though, I'm inclined to believe that pg's help does provide more than a ""6.4%"" boost to your chances of success.",1219443546

Too many ""alpha geeks"" want to screen for raw coding ability, but don't properly filter out the people who can't <i>read</i> code.

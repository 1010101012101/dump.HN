At a certain point the Nigerian delegation stood up and walked out.  It was quite dramatic -- they were dressed in beautiful African robes.  Then the meeting broke up and I had this conversation with one of the people from the Nigerian delegation who went by.  'Why did you walk out, what's going on?' 'I can't talk to these Americans.' (Nobody thought of me as an American.) 'Why not?' 'Because they say what they mean.'<p>""We're so brought up with the idea that communication fails when people don't say what they mean.  The man explained, 'When two Americans have a conversation, each says what he thinks, and then there's a confrontation -- one's going to be right and the other one's going to be wrong.  We don't do it like that.  We sit around under the tree, and somebody says something, and somebody else does, and we talk and nobody has a position.  It goes on for a long time, and maybe tomorrow, or eventually, everybody agrees on a position.  Then everyone is right and there isn't anybody's point of view left out.'",1267828942

If you'd like something stimulating and potentially useful, more advanced combinatorics, number theory, or algebraic geometry might all be good choices.  The first two tend to overlap a bit when they are presented in textbooks (with some group theory tossed in as well).  If you do crazy graphics programming, or if you program robots' spatial reasoning, algebraic geometry might pay off - though, AG doesn't have as easy an entry. (One exception might be via the book Computational Algebraic Geometry by Hal Schenck).<p>As far as number theory ""paying off"": 1) Many proofs in number theory are algorithmic in nature; 2) Computers understand integers with greater facility than they do the psuedo-reals we call floats - often times efficient integer approximations will be more appropriate than slower floating point solutions, and knowing the integers will help you develop/understand these approximations; 3) If cryptography is your bag, number theory is a must; 4) Martin Davis, Yuri Matiyasevich, Julia Robinson, Hilbert's 10th problem, Turing Machines, computability theory, and (the number theory bit) diophantine equations (sorry to be cryptic, this is getting rather long winded).",1267828557

Sort by being able to disallow keywords, usernames, dates, etc. to get the stories you'll like the most first when you check.<p>In my my brief research (i.e. Google search) it doesn't look like HN has an API. Possibly scraping the data using scRUBYt! (for ROR) or a similar technique would be effective enough. Then, you would re-weight the data based on additional specifications.<p>If you took the last x00 submissions (or top x00 in current popularity) and then taught the application what you did and didn't like, it could remove, raise or lower results as they came in.<p>As an example:
In my case, Look at HN about twice a day. I generally like submissions with ""Ask HN"", ""Tell HN"" and ""SASS"" in the title. I don't like submissions discussing ""Clojure"" or ""iPad"" in the title. They aren't relevant to me. With my example, after scraping the data, the application could bump anything with a keyword I like up the list by 20%, and anything I don't like down the list by 50% (or 100% if I really hate everything on such a subject). There's so much more that could be said, but it seems quite simple.<p>I'm a designer mainly, and wannabe hacker. Any thoughts? Is this frowned upon by HN in general?

Your prototypical geek enjoys discourse to refine a point. Inclusion of qualifiers such as ""I think..."" are antithetical _not because the implication of uncertainty invites argument, but because it dissuades discussion_. In short, if I say that I think something, I imply that I already know someone disagrees and yet I think it anyway. Further dialogue on that topic is dissuaded, because the first author implies that they're possibly already aware of your opinion.",1267827897

The server then reads all sockets whenever data is available and shove status updates into a single in-memory data model which is queried once a second by each client connected to the server.<p>In any case, multithreaded programming is cool. Where else do you get to write test cases that start 1000 threads in a loop 100 times to ensure that funky race conditions have a high probability of occurring.<p>What's worse is right now I have to write non-multi threaded code which is multi threaded. A wierd thing. Basically there is no way for me to write multithreaded code BUT my events get triggered in parallel so any framework I write that can be accessed by multiple requests all of which can happen at once require a sort of setup, store in session, clone, modify, execute methodology.<p>Edit: I tried some multithreading in ruby, when porting between different VMs (1.8 vs 1.9 vs jruby) the code started going into deadlocks.

I know that I might be wrong, but it is far more efficient and honest to simply state my beliefs and opinions without cluttering my sentences with lots of extra fluff.""

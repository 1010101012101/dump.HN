A friend of mine had to order four iMacs untill Apple finally could deliver one without severe production faults. So I think Apple should work on the quality of their products a bit harder...<p>Now I have a Dell Notebook (Latitude X1) which is great, and since it has no fan, it is silent. I wonder when Apple will finally get another subnotebook out of the door.",1190015477

55592,comment,55325,55325,0,0,tx,,,"He believes that Apple is not growing <i>even faster</i> because they do not sell as much in retail. He mentions HP. But not DELL, who is #1 and also sells (mostly) through their web site and have very limited in-store presence.<p>Am I missing something? What's the point of an article like that if his only argument is so weak? I, personally, see exponential growth of apple hardware among my friends and peers.<p>And I just did not get his ""flywheel"" paragraph about Vista. Is it going to suck less because of... of what? \n",1190013987
55591,comment,54977,55295,0,0,pc,,,"Facebook does a lot of almost invisible but extremely smart things. Two examples: when you specify the type of relationship when adding a friend, Facebook uses the info to decide how much information to present about the person in your news feed. Or when two people list themselves as being in a relationship, Facebook will show the most recent picture of the two together (if such a picture exists, and privacy permissions permit it in your case).<p>Nothing fancy. Just extremely well thought out.",1190013968

55588,comment,55576,55576,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I think too many people have been subjected to bad e-mail interfaces for too long, especially with regards to spam. Being exposed to a nice interface like GMail or a personally-configured solution with a nice SpamAssassin learning filter would go a long way towards making people appreciate e-mail more. I always find myself surprised when people still cite spam as a major problem, but those are inevitably the people who are using a default install of Outlook or a crappy webmail interface for their school. E-mail might die for these people, but for those of us who know how to actually use e-mail effectively, I don't think it will ever die.",1190012728

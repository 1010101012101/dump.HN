At first I thought, yeah, it&#x27;s just old robber-baron/intellectual elite hubris, and the first thing that came to mind (as I&#x27;m sure it did for many other viewers of the talk) was that episode of the Simpsons where the &quot;council of learned citizens&quot;  later renamed as &quot;the council of Alphas&quot;  came to power and ruled Springfield until Stephen Hawking rescues the people of the town from the utopia-turned-dystopia of the elite.<p>But in order to compare this sentiment (that, if given as a talk in that forum, is probably not just in the mind of that particular speaker) to other historic notions of powerful elites, we need to examine the details.<p>On first viewing, I noticed a few things. First, he expresses a desire to rule (it&#x27;s obvious though perhaps only in the subtext), though not to subject the general population to his superior governance, but rather to leave them behind. Second, he treats Silicon Valley&#x27;s (SV as a symbol, of course) superiority as fait accompli rather than a continuous struggle for power. Third, he considers himself a pioneer and &quot;frontiersman&quot;, though (I think) he does not take life-threatening risks as others considered frontiersmen did.<p>I wonder if anyone can compare these points (and others  I&#x27;m sure I have missed quite a few) to other historic elites and their self perception.<p>I think that, if taken as a historical document, there is much to study in this talk.",1383043854

And yes saying &quot;oh but it is because it has weak types&quot; doesn&#x27;t excuse it, it is broken and that&#x27;s that. Naming the brokeness with a label or showing why historically it is there, doesn&#x27;t fix it.<p>On the other hand they do have nice closure support, I do like some of that. But in large, the language makes me angry every time I have to use it.<p>Someone mentioned Dart, I am hopeful for that. But who knows how long till dartvm is embedded in Chrome. For now dart.js and source maps might help.<p>There is a bit more palatable Coffeescript. But it only puts some band-aids over JS&#x27;s brokenness.<p>Also agree with callback hell. It is funny people extol is at the next big thing -- whoo, asynchronous calls! You can callback in your callback while you callback. No, no, no. That is a horrible way to handle large concurrency problems! (Good for quick one page examples though!).  Async and friends help. But why the heck do I need to stick a callback in the middle of my logic if all I need to do is make a request to the database or another GET request?<p>The only sane way I know how to best handle concurrency is using a language with support of goroutines/isolates/tasks or even threads and queues. Even deferreds are just sugar on top of callbacks. We all know how Python&#x27;s Twisted has taken over the world, right? Oh wait, it hasn&#x27;t. Calling them Futures or Tulips or whatever doesn&#x27;t fix the underlying problem.<p>> I can understand that some people wanted to escape the MRI infrastructure by going Node, because - you know - learning Japanese is hard.<p>Granted node is fast. (And according to its author scales linearly across CPU cores, sorry couldn&#x27;t resist the mandatory jab at that). Ok it doesn&#x27;t really scale across cores and it will block everything if you do a for loop in the middle of your logic. But it is really fast, amazingly so. And that is like crack. It gets people hooked.<p>EDIT: JS has weak types not just dynamic, one can have dynamic and strong types for example, like Python ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_typing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_typing</a> ).

The battery shape can be designed to go with whatever packaging is chosen.<p>In this scenario, the packaging decisions are already made - or rather, there isn&#x27;t much flexibility. Each device has to be a cuboid, placed next to each other. The same is true of the battery. The packaging of the blocks is going to cost you some space (connectors, case), but you&#x27;re also going to waste space in a block as it&#x27;s unlikely the given chip is going to be exactly as big as the package. The same is true of the battery - rather than fitting in a customised space, it&#x27;s another cuboid.<p>All of these little inefficiencies of space will add up, so that either you&#x27;ve got a very big phone, or one with a very small battery.",1383041049

Normally they would have to go out and hire a custom programming company to use a very high level technology to create a solution. This is very time intensive, complicated and because the programmers don&#x27;t understand your business, often there is a massive communication gap and projects often fail. Cell Master is a much easier way for business owners and people inside of your business to create custom business software. It is effective because you understand the business, you understand what the software needs to do and how it needs to work. All you need is just some basic excel skills, knowing how to use excel formulas, and you can have the same potential as the expert programmer. So this means you are going to be able to create the software faster, you will be able to modify and adapt the software, it will be a lot more cost efficient and you will be able to create the solution that you want, not the solution that the programmers think you want. You will be able to create an interactive web application that solves your business problem with your own custom software. You will be able to do it with only excel skills, you don&#x27;t need HTML skills, web server skills etc. With only spreadsheet skills, you can create your own custom web application.<p>Hello world: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oogKKfbRyMQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oogKKfbRyMQ</a>",1383040964

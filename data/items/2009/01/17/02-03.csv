437684,comment,437623,437623,0,0,azanar,,,"I don't think that holding services legal liable for short-notice service cancellations is the correct way to go, as annoying as the cancellation might for the users involved.<p>It would become yet another diversion of time and money away from the goal of improving and keeping the service running. It might be an absorbable cost for a company as large as AOL, but it might be the difference between living and dying for a small company just trying to get going. Even if they could survive though, it doesn't mean they should be held liable. Forcing them to spend money being graceful at shutting down one service might result in collateral damage of other services to offset the cost.<p>It's ultimately a question between corporate and personal responsibility. In the end, they are another data storage mechanism. And as with all means of data storage, you need to keep backups somewhere else.<p>Metaphorically comparing this to tenant eviction just doesn't work. One's livelihood is not threatened by losing some photos or blogposts, and the cost of maintaining backups is insignificant compared to the cost of maintaining an alternative place to live.",1232161100

437682,comment,437668,437668,0,0,madmanslitany,,,"I'm not sure if I agree with the author's conclusion, which seems to be that the newer generations of computer scientists are going to identify less with its separate sub-domains (science, math, engineering) than with the discipline as a sort of whole.  Typically, I'd expect that undergraduates and graduates going through universities are going to have their perception of the field shaped heavily by which of the three sub-domains the university faculty most closely identifies with.  A lot of the major computer science schools do have a greater emphasis in certain areas--for instance, I went to Cornell, and you could really feel how much emphasis the school placed on theory (i.e. mathematics), and that's shaped my impression of what CS really is.",1232160938

437675,comment,436663,436740,0,0,azanar,,,"I worry about the absoluteness of 2 & 4.<p>I've seen too many places where reasoning similar to that of 2 results in developers prematurely punting to quick and dirty hacks to get a trouble ticket closed faster. It may not be possible to get by with anything but a one-off conditional, especially in tax calculation , but I worry about the claim that it is inevitable. It provides a justification to not look for more maintainable alternatives first.<p>The same thing with 4. The only thing that bothers me is the sense of inevitablility. There are places where specific cases need to be dealt with in code, and it is an entirely different argument of how they should be dealt with once that much is assumed. But the inevitability bothers me, if only because I have run into several cases where things were claimed inevitable, and upon closer inspection caused large amounts of pain that could have been avoided if the existence of alternatives was considered.",1232160063

It took me 10-15mins to discover how to enter a note: you have to click where the cursor is. And not just where the cursor is, but <i>slightly to the right</i>... I had to read the help, and it wasn't even the first thing!<p>Entering a note is the very first thing a user wants to do. For user adoption (which is the what you need when starting), you have to make that first thing incredibly easy: click somewhere, get a note. All the additional sophistication should be additional to that. (IMO)<p>I think they are aiming at existing users of existing tools. But I think that's too hard - they can't beat desktop applications on their own turf. There's a lot of sophistication in the tool - so it's like they are aiming at what the professional applications do. These tools have competed and evolved to meet the needs of professional composers. However, I think a web tool is really in a different market, with a different proposition. They should first focus on where they strong. It's Writely vs. Word.<p>Music layout is hard, and their's gets messy when it's more complex (looking at Moonlight Sonata).<p>The fact that you can't publish to the web, or share (except with people who are already members) makes it harder to get started. Maybe not allow the whole score to be viewed without an account, but a tempter, to entice get people to sign up for the rest. As it is, there's little evidence that it's worth signing up. But maybe focusing on dedicated users (not casual) will work? As I said, it's pretty niche.",1232159448

I've never really been comfortable or understood sales. In school my only few real experiences in sales was selling some product for some benefit or fundraiser.From that, I got the idea that successful selling required convincing some unknown person that the finished product solved their specific needs that I was basically unaware of. So it was pretty much a numbers game, more attempts mean more money.<p>I like the idea of a product development cycle where the customers and users are shaping the product. I also really like the idea that I can easily validate a product concept by seeing if the people advising me would actually buy in to demo. This presentation has helped me feel more comfortable with the process of successful product development and sales.",1232158172

I don't think the facts have quite come out yet.  I do think it has a lot to do with the models of the businesses doing the research.  I bet you'd find that Hulu has a pretty interesting long tail (and plenty of blockbusters, as well), because I go there a couple of times a week, and I'm sometimes surprised by what has bubbled to the top 50 results--quite a lot of back catalog stuff.  Even stuff that has been out of regular syndication for years, like the original Battlestar Galactica, and other old, somewhat forgotten shows, and shows that didn't make it very long on TV, like Firefly and John Doe.<p>I don't know, as I haven't studied things very closely--I saw Anderson give his long tail talk a few years ago, and I've read the article when it was published, but I haven't paid it too much mind.  I do know that my tastes are squarely in the long tail.  I don't watch blockbuster movies, I don't buy blockbuster records, and I don't read blockbuster books, in general.  But, I also know that I'm not ""normal"" or ""average"" in my tastes, so I am and outlier and not a reliable predictor of anything the average consumer is going to do.  I will point out, though, that there are more independent records being made, more independent films being produced, and more independent literature being produced than at any time in history.  That has to be explainable <i>somehow</i>, though I don't know if the long tail is the right way to explain it.  Maybe it's just bigger populations plus the Internet equals ""everybody gets to makes records/movies/literature"" now.",1232158052

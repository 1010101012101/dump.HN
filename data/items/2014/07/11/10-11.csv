Think of Google in 2003, Amazon in 99&#x27; or MSFT in 89&#x27;.<p>None of your medium-long term assumptions can stand on very solid ground. What the market is, it&#x27;s size, it&#x27;s structure and the company&#x27;s potential role in it.<p>Assumption: &quot;the primary market Uber is targeting is the global taxi and car-service market ($100 billion)&quot; - is this correct in 5-10 years? Could Uber target other markets? Deliveries<p>Assumption: Uber are taking over market share. Can other forms of transport, public or private be replaced by Uber? Where do new technologies (like self riving cars) affect things?<p>My own speculations gravitate towards efficiencies from having all that data valuable at once.<p>The 5 seater is a general purpose vehicle for 1-5 people and used for highway driving and for short trips along congested streets. Could Uber&#x27;s smart system offer regular Sedans for 25 mile highway journeys and golf cart like cars for 1 person inner city journeys?<p>Could hub and spoke systems exist where several cars take single passengers to a van/shuttle for longer (more expensive) journeys.<p>Everything is low probability big payoff. Even the the straightforward mission:&#x27;take over the existing taxi-limo&#x27; is still a high risk-reward proposition. Basically, I think this rebuttal is better than the original analysis.

8019507,comment,8019280,8019280,2,0,JackMorgan,,,"I think of software development on a continuum from tactical to strategic. The tactical end of the scale involves faster creation and modification of artifacts. Strategic involves knowing what artifacts to create and why.<p>To be an outstanding developer, you should be skilled all along the continuum. Those who are slow tactically will only every be able to read books about strategic designs etc, which is good but will limit their skills. I&#x27;m reminded of a developer I once knew who thought he had all the answers architecturally, but was such a slow typer and didn&#x27;t know how to use tools available to modify code that he&#x27;d never actually implemented any if the things he dreamed of, and who is going to trust someone with no experience? Also his ideas definitely had a &quot;here&#x27;s a big picture design, you guys figure out how to implement it&quot; view to them, which meant they usually were not really a good idea.<p>As such, I think it is important to learn; fast typing (touch typing), fast editing (Vim, regex scripts, and all available refactoring tools), fast local coding (TDD, proper use of functions as an abstraction, and good naming), good module sizing (either namespaces or objects), then good module separation through services or message passing. I had to learn all of these in the last six years. I think every one was valuable. I had to learn to touch type after 22 years not being able to, but it has helped immensely in being able to fluidly get thoughts to editor.",1405074578

Initial impressions are good, I like it a lot, but if I could make one feature request I would love to have another way to add bookmarks. If there was a big plus button I could hit in the top left that brought up the &#x27;add bookmark&#x27; screen it&#x27;d be helpful. I already accidentally dismissed the &#x27;do you want to add the clipboard&#x27;s link&#x27;, and I frequently copy full tweets with links I&#x27;d like to save (as link + description), (EDIT: these don&#x27;t trigger the &#x27;link in buffer&#x27; prompt). This might also be helpful for pinboard&#x27;s linkless notes? Anyway, thanks for the great app :)",1405073664

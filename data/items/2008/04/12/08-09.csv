The board consists of the founder, the head VC, and two people who are employed by the head VC.<p>To me, this is three wolves and a sheep deciding on what's for dinner.  My feeling is that the appointment of the president (my initial concern) is simply the natural outcome of the overall power structure - and likely just the tip of the iceberg.<p>I appreciate your feedback (in particular, thank you Dennis for the excellent link).  I'll let YC know how this all pans out...",1207990588

I think if Microsoft were not paying the vendors, more vendors would offer PCs with Linux or without any OS at all.<p>Weren't the first Linux PCs by Dell even more expensive than the Windows variants (I am not sure if I remember correctly)?",1207989913
161763,comment,161609,161609,0,0,bubaker,,,"A computer is basically something that helps me think outside of my head, like pen and paper or a chalkboard or camera and printer.  The difference is that a computer helps me write, draw, and design things, and play around (with abstractions like words, numbers, diagrams, pictures, audio, video) in often easier and unique ways.<p>The internet is a way for me to do these types of things on a computer with other people, observing and interacting with their abstractions and letting them do the same with mine.  Often, this creates an opportunity to make $$ because maybe I or others have or can come up with information and other stuff that is valuable or desirable to someone.  It also provides ways of finding out about what people in general are thinking, doing, making, and wanting.<p>Of course, many forms of media also function similarly, but often more slowly and with less integrated ways of communicating.  Take YouTube, which combines ad-driven and searchable video with discussion and polling in relative ""real-time"".  Without the internet, a broadcast TV network might air a program which allow viewers to call-in to discuss and rate various aspects of the show.  However, many aspects are not only different, but asymmetrically so.  Here are some of these aspects:<p>- YouTube viewers register their contributions themselves - little or no effort by the ""network"" and certainly not the producer/provider\n- even if the network had someone transcribe the discussion, it would not be available soon or cheaply\n- ads (which drive so much of the web and so the internet for many) are simultaneous, usually unobtrusive, targeted, and often interactive as well\n- the act of viewing/interacting on YouTube itself is a contribution (via logging/cookies) which in aggregate and dynamically drives further content/discussion\n- eventually the network company can focus on advertising and let viewers budget for content  :-)<p>Much of the above applies in large part to organizational use of computer and internet as well, though philosophies of management, security, IP, etc can determine whether the technology is a boon or dongle.  Then again, the same could be said for how I or anyone else tries to make use of the technology...",1207989726

If App Engine fails to scale because the bandwidth is too expensive then Google can reduce the price. I don't think the article even understands that this isn't simply another shared host. The joyent people didn't get it with their 'give the people root'.",1207988679

That thing over there, yeah the one with the keyboard and screen, that's the advanced telephone we call a ""computer.""  Instead of dialing someone with numbers, you dial with letters.  And we call the big telephone network the ""internet.""",1207987254

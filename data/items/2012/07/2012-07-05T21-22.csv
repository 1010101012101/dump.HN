4205163,comment,4203443,4204875,2,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Thanks, that clarified things. Unfortunately I too know little about actually writing compilers so my depth is limited. But I will offer some thoughts anyways.<p>The slow down in dynamic languages is in more than type checks though. The slow down is because dynamic languages are like some crazy awesome dream world where anything can change at any given moment and things are not necessarily what they seem. So VMs must be extra vigilant, checking many things like assignment, for exceptions, if the object is still the same class, if it still has the same methods etc. The term dynamic is almost an understatement! Add to that boxing and the possibility of heterogeneous collections and slow downs are the price to pay for all that flexibility. This makes things very hard to predict both on the compiler level and also at the CPU level in terms of branching - which alone is very costly. Dynamic language programs are <i>not easily compressed</i>. There are ways around that and languages like Clojure offer a sort of compromise, by being able to lock certain parts down in a solid reality, structures  (in the sense of regularities) coalesce and can be used to speed up parts of your code. You can choose where to trade flexibility for speed.<p>You're right (Subtype) Polymorphsism do incur a cost but modern CPUs can well handle these. But with parametric polymorphism and value types you get no runtime hits and also get some free theorems to boot.<p>That said, how you think has to have some influence. I have never found static types to be constraining, I actually feel like the allow me to more easily plan future consequences. I suppose I trade implementation freedom for the ability to create consequence trees of greater depth and quickly eliminate unproductive branches.",1341524930

There are COMSEC custodians who are experts at implementing, operating and repairing a wide variety of cryptographic equipment, while also managing a program that generates, issues, maintains and disposes of an organization's crypto keying material. There are also security managers who at one time may have been experts in a specific domain, but are now called upon to maintain a bird's eye view of an organization's entire security strategy in order to develop a cohesive plan for minimizing the treats presented to their employer. There are intelligence analysts who make an organization more secure by using their expertise of social engineering to actively track down those who would wish them harm. Each of these types of employees is a security expert in their own right, yet none of these examples really need any knowledge of programming.<p>When you look at the content from the Security+, CISSP, and CISM, the classes lean heavily towards information security, but they address the other areas briefly. More specifically, they focus on information security from the perspective of a security manager. In other words, you don't take these certifications to gain technical expertise.<p>Unfortunately, many businesses fail to understand this, and so they end up making CISSP a requirement for their technical recruits out of ignorance.

The way I explain use of automated tools to our clients is that, yes, the assessment you're paying for is to have a skilled security expert manually assessing your application. That said, in order to get the most efficiency out of manual testing, those parts which can be easily automated should be.<p>A few trivial examples would be finding open ports, or detecting expired/weak SSL certificates. Sure, an engineer could manually connect to all 65535 ports to see if they're open, and manually grab banners, or he could just run `nmap -p- -sV hostname`. Similarly, he could use openssl to check all aspects of an SSL certificate, but why bother when there are tools to do this for you?<p>The same is true in application security, although the examples can be a little fuzzier (pun intended?). The more seamless automation can be integrated into testing, the more time for <i>manual</i> analysis can be allotted.

</code></pre>
Why hasn't the movie/music industry copyright enforcers not capalised on all these wonderfu inventions they portray.  It's not like you have to have a working example of your patent being executed when you submit a patent.  You just have to be first, even if you havn't worked out the small details of like making it work, you can just clevely word around it in lawyerlease.  Then when somebody who knows what they are doing actualy does invent and make it work for some practical use; Well you just sue them as you own the patent, ego you invented it and there stealing your idea, you could afford and had the support staff to word in such a way that you could submit it first.  You don't have to make the product, you don't even have to have the technicaly genius needed to make it into a working product, you just have to word it right and be able to afford the costs to have it processed and get it sumbited first.<p>in many ways patent submission is akin to being able to word and submit something first without even having a clue how to add value, as in having something that actualy works and is physical present.  Much like how computerised stock market programs work by processing there share dealing faster than others so they can see incomming trends/transaction and be able to submit there requests/purchases/sells or patent applications before everybody else.  Funny as the only people who like that approach to fairness are those that are activly doing it and those are only the ones who can afford to do it.<p>I personaly believe that to be able to submit a patent you must be able to demostrate something that works using your patent in the way outlines in the patent.  So a 1980's augumented reality set of glass's attached to a mainframe and battery the size of a small car would not IMHO constitute the ability to submit a patent about a mobile interface in glass's as it is hardly mobile.  But I'm sure there are a fair few patents already pertaining to augmented reality via a computer, just been done so many times it would shock anybody if it was not the case.  I'm sure somebody who is more versed in the patent search process will do a better job in a later post outlining many of them.<p>So on that note I leave you with perhaps a marketing slogan Apple could adopt along with many other companies as well.  ""Patenting your childhood TV SCI-FI show's since after they were made"".  Oh and with that frame of mindset I do wonder how long it will be until `Hollywood` starts to realise there are much bigger pies to chase than the pursuit of stealing there interlectual property.<p>But I could be totaly wrong, like how I think when a product is suspected of breaking a patent then instead of banning it, that the company breaking the patent is allowed to lodge a deposit with a 3rd party of the court a amount money equal to as if the patent had been fairly paid for under liscence and they are allowed to carry on doing buisiness then.  Only if they are unable to do that can a ban be looked at.  Be fairer on companies involved in disputes and less impacting upon wasted resources like unsellable product doing nothing beyond devaluing.  Oh and fair upon the comsumer who can stay ignorant of these petty patent disputes.  But I'm no judge and I'm a nobody who has no say in how the whole World wide patent application process resolves.",1341523605

4205018,comment,4203421,4203734,2,0,jdietrich,,,"Dozens of sports have been dealing with similar issues for many years, with no significant difficulties.<p>Golf is perhaps the most obvious example - the Royal and Ancient rulebook includes restrictions on everything from clubhead size to coefficients of restitution to groove angles, in order to ensure that traditional courses remain relevant. They have taken a sport far more complex than running and established a very effective set of rules to freeze the development of equipment used by professionals. Twenty years ago there was the fear that longer and longer drives were going to render old courses obsolete, but that concern is all but gone - the rulebook sets hard limits on the basic mechanical properties of equipment.<p>If disabled athletes start outrunning able-bodied athletes, the solution is very simple - the IAAF simply adds a paragraph to Rule 143 of the Competition Rules, which currently specifies the regulations for shoes and clothing. A coefficient of restitution rule, like that used in most ball games, would be easy to assess and put a hard limit on the efficiency of prostheses. If the International Paralympic Committee decides not to make such restrictions, that's their business and would have no effect on able-bodied sport.",1341523114

4205000,story,,,13,16,RutZap,"Ask HN: I am forced to write awful code What do I do?",,"So the story is: I got a new job as a PHP web developer at a rather respectable digital studio in UK. I was very enthusiastic about this one but now, after 3 months, I am building and maintaining websites using  a CMS built in 2005. The code is far from being up to standards, MVC being something that I can only dream about.<p>To have an idea about the code I am going to tell you that we have a PHP class called dbConfig which stores database credentials. This class is then extended by a DB class which has query functions and other functions that deal with data retrieval from the db. This class (DB) is then extended by a class called front-end which has some functions that generate forms and escape inputs. this class (front-end) is then extended by a Cart class that deals with user logic and creates a sort of a fully functioning shopping cart (amazing i know!).<p>All this badly implemented inheritance is topped up by the fact that global variables are used throughout the site/app. It is an awful procedural codebase (at one point it even uses magic quotes). Everything single job becomes a bodge job. If I have to change something it then creates an error in a totally different part of the website.<p>I have suggested that we move towards a MVC framework or something that will help with this horrible dependencies and will probably decouple most of the things, so that code maintenance would be easier. Sadly, it seems that the company is more interested in spewing up websites and cashing in the money (from some rather big international clients) than in creating better quality software.<p>Now that you know my situation.. here comes the question: What should I do? How can I speed up the transition to a development process that is up to the industry standards? (did I tell you that we still deploy apps with FTP and have htaccess authentication for the web administration area??) I am sure that there are some developers among you that have been in my situation at one point in their career... so what did you do? How can I say this to my boss? I don't want to be responsible for crappy websites that pollute the internet, I don't want to keep on bodging code.... but at the same time, I don't really want to change my workplace (it's well paid, close to home, etc. etc.)<p>Thank you all, and...

Bridge is the actual downloadable Bridge server, and Bridge Cloud is simply the Bridge server running on a few cloud instances.<p>You can get started with both for free[1]. The benefit of Bridge Cloud is that you don't have to operate the actual Bridge server. This is great for people testing Bridge or startups that want to focus on their product. The downside is the latency of a cloud hosted Bridge server. Each message travels to our cloud first before going to your servers/clients. This is fine for most use cases - there's a  startup that built a synchronous realtime mobile multiplayer game over 3G internet and there are no lag problems. The pricing for Bridge Cloud is to simply cover the cost of hardware and running the service.<p>The primary deployment model is the Bridge server itself. You can download a free version and run it on one server rate limited to 40k msg/min. That's a huge amount of messaging for free. As you grow, we'd like to provide commercial support and charge on a per-core basis.<p>Most startups and developers can use Bridge without paying a single dime. Large organizations whose only other alternative is to pay millions of dollars for bloated enterprise software from the 80s or hire an in-house team of messaging experts will find it cheaper and better to pay for Bridge.",1341522765

You can't do that. You can only bind data to fields.<p><pre><code>    $stmt = $db->prepare('SELECT bar FROM foo

For that, I can unplug the speaker's 3.5mm cord from my phone and plug it into my friend's phone.

4204943,comment,4204606,4204864,5,0,djcapelis,,,"> Could the made in the US selling point of the Q actually be big enough to drive sales? Would americans actually pay more only because of that?<p>Well, generally no.  Which is why you don't see many products actually being made in the US and it's more the domain of obscure kickstarter projects.  (And why the Nexus Q is such a confusing and odd exception that this makes the news.)<p>There is generally a notion that the US should be doing it's own manufacturing and an idea that we should be doing our own sweating for our own goods.  It's seen as a fairly noble goal, but I think the market has generally shown people aren't usually willing to pay that much more for it.  It's a marketing point in your favor if you can get it, but if it's going to effect the cost by a bunch... most people just don't care enough.<p>Also I think the motivations are mixed.  It's not just about patriotism but about a political desire to see products made in a country where it's easier to ensure that the people who poured sweat into them were compensated fairly.  The impression is US labor laws generally will ensure that and most of the countries US products get imported from, do not have those types of frameworks.<p>(Obviously there are other countries which do, but we don't tend to import cheap consumer goods from countries with labor costs as high as ours, for obvious reasons. :))",1341522057

It's tribalism, something deeply encoded in our behavior from many thousands of years of tribal evolution.)",1341522018

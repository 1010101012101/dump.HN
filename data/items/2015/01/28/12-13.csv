8959501,comment,8959211,8959432,0,0,nothrabannosir,,,"Religion is for morality. Your point is fair, but we are talking about prohibition. That is (ideally) not done on the basis of morality alone.<p>A good reason for a law to exist is to protect people from each other. Hence laws against real murder, and real child abuse. Photos of child abuse are clearly illegal because they mean actual child abuse has taken place. Not because they are immoral, per se. They may be, but that&#x27;s not as clear an argument.<p>For the same reason, the discussion about the legality of drawings / enactments of illegal acts centers not around morality, but around whether or not it will lead to more of those acts actually happening.<p>You&#x27;re getting downvoted because you stick to making the morality argument, implying that is reason enough for prohibition.

On the flip side, I work at a startup where out of 7 excellent engineers only 3 have CS degrees and 2 have no college degree at all.<p>A CS degree will help you get your foot in the door for your first job regardless. Once you have a few years of experience your degree matters much less - with a few exceptions (including the large corps mentioned above). If you want to work on &quot;hard&quot; problems, a CS degree (or at least a minor plus a math major) will be valuable for the work as well as the hiring. (A math major or - if you want to work with hardware - an electrical engineering major plus CS coursework are nearly equivalent to a CS degree for many employers in general, but HR departments too often use software to filter by too-narrow requirements.)<p>On the flip side, if you just want to build basic web and mobile apps, you can get started in a career with not much more than basic practical knowledge of a scripting language, one database, and HTTP. (But the more you know and can demonstrate you know, the better!) For entry level jobs in this part of the field, big corporations still tend to care more about credentials but startups care more about demonstrated experience.<p>If you want to go into programming in any shape or form, and if you do have the opportunity to take CS classes alongside other coursework, I&#x27;d particularly recommend taking classes on algorithms and data structures (including the infamous big-O notation), a bit about encryption, and if possible the underlying lower-level underpinnings of programming (from logic gates to assembly, bits, bytes, pointers, and machine language).

It&#x27;s called stagflation [0] which occurred in late 70s in the US.<p>I don&#x27;t believe the macro economy is random.

If you look at empirical evidence (regression) for what most consider economic truths, you&#x27;ll see a shockingly low R^2.<p>That being said, I think some economic truths can be discovered through logic. For instance, all else being equal, an increase in money supply will result in higher prices.

As Nicholson later wrote me, “The fact that people stayed for 48 hours to work on something put them head and shoulders above the thousands of applications we receive, because the participants are people who show up and see things through.”<p>And this event is an attempt to make showing up for a 48 hour &#x27;work trial&#x27; a norm. This favors the younger, single population, and while you&#x27;re working on whatever this event is, you are not putting more resumes out. There&#x27;s the potential for abuse in getting free work out of applicants from other people mimicking this event.<p>(How long until we&#x27;re tossed into an arena with bows and arrows only to survive and rewrite every algorithm from a CS degree on a whiteboard?)<p>Although the 46% percentage figure was shown in this thread to be wrong/bad, even if you consider hiring as a coin-toss, your success still depends on how many resumes you can put out there. You have to balance the time it takes to tailor your resume to the company versus moving on and finding the next company to submit a resume to. At the extremes, some people don&#x27;t tailor at all and throw their resume and cover letter at everyone in a suit. Others will do deep-dive research and make 27 drafts of a resume/cover to the point where they already know more about the company than the person who may hire them. I still think there&#x27;s significant coin-tossery going on: if the companies are having to filter everyone because there is so much volume, then you must at least do as much as you can to increase your own output. The &#x27;trick&#x27; then is to just know someone who can put in a good word (and it really has always been an option)<p>This may work for some job sectors as a novel hiring process (it&#x27;s certainly overblown for retail/fast food) but if it scales up, you&#x27;ll end up taking significant bargaining power from individuals. To say nothing if companies start replacing their current employees with the winners from these kinds of events.",1422448752

I&#x27;ve witnessed my work being plagiarized and edited before. I personally accept it as just the way reality is– some people are lazy about attribution, and other people like feeling talented and special when they diliberately share others&#x27; content without attribution or remixing.<p>The answer to &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t anyone care&quot;- it all boils down to incentive structures. &quot;Parody accounts&quot; can steal with impunity. &quot;Casual randos&quot; can steal with impunity.<p>- If you&#x27;re an artist, and faceless, nameless folks plagiarize your work, going after them actually makes you look insecure or clueless. (Metallica and Napster come to mind.)<p>- If you get plagiarized by someone Bigger, Badder and More Powerful, then that&#x27;s a news story in itself- you&#x27;re the underdog, and everybody loves to root for the underdog.<p>The best response to plagiarism, in my opinion, is to make more art. Some artists get very offended by this- they feel that they are entitled to all the attribution to all their work forever and ever. And that would be a beautiful world, I guess, and maybe discussions like these help to educate people. I also can imagine a world where- when you make a joke that&#x27;s been made before (online), or you post an image that&#x27;s been posted before, a sort of reverse Google / reverse image search will reveal to readers where the origin of the remix is.<p>For anybody who is curious about this sort of thing, I highly recommend the video Everything Is A Remix: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coGpmA4saEk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coGpmA4saEk</a>",1422448001

The second looks up the CLI and checks a number of those &quot;who is calling me sites&quot; if the number is know for spam it does not get to the phone and starts reading the comments back to them about their number (cli will get round this). Both ways have issues. The reason I bring this up is because we become an MVNO and in turn run our own sim cards. This meant that we could have had the blacklist/whitelist without messing with the call flow to much. This also allowed you to dial 9 to block the last number that called you was sexy but meh too much work to run an MVNO and just no money in it.<p>We will see.

For me, it was a routine should-have-been-minor web server update where one of the packages I relied on suddenly became unsupported and every single hosted site stopped working.<p>I&#x27;m not wishing to be inflammatory here, but surely you could have exactly the same problem with something that is updated &#x27;slowly&#x27;. If you&#x27;re relying on the software you get being 100% correct/bug free every time you get it, you&#x27;re building your house on sand.<p>This is where having testing (ideally a good set of automated testing) is invaluable. Having a robust set of tests you run before you roll out changes to &#x27;production&#x27; is important if your &#x27;production&#x27; is &quot;we can&#x27;t afford for this to go down.&quot;<p>Along testing, you need to have a backout strategy. What do you do if it all goes wrong? This is usually very similar to your backup/restore strategy as the problem is generally the same: If your server gets hosed/breaks/fails, what do you do?",1422446722

The interesting thing is that there are areas, even inside tech, that this <i>is</i> the default. And it&#x27;s nto necessarily better. For example, steelworks or the oil industry. A pretty significant portion of the employees in these fields (including IT sectors) are contractors. They have minimal job security and limited motivation to excel (even in the steel industry where perks are fairly decent).<p>I know this empirically because whenever we have a job opening there is a queue of people from these industries looking for a more stable role, even if it means a pay cut. Which somewhat gets to the heart of it - this is about job security!<p>What you are describing works well when you look at the top 0.5%, or maybe less, of employees. For the rest, the current system has evolved to favour the employee and provide stability for them month-to-month.<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong; it&#x27;s imperfect, and we need to evolve the system again! But short-term working is not a coverall solution IMO.",1422446562

Some time ago (early/mid 90s I think) there was a particular problem with pickpockets in the Kings Cross area so an awareness campaign was started with similar posters. The problem got worse. Why?

I closed the browser and thought nothing more of it. The other time I was taken to a registration page where I was asked for some of my details in order to get the data - if I scan a QR code I expect to go direct to relevant information, not to be asked for my personal details (I could have oput in fake details easily, but I should not have to go to even that effort).

4131102,comment,4130035,4130035,1,0,mgkimsal,,,"Have wrestled with the same idea and variations of it for years.<p>As others have pointed out, getting local businesses to use it will be problematic for a number of reasons.  So, another variation would be to turn it on its head and make a 'I want something' system - something for people to signal what they're looking for - and make these requests available to any local business to watch/review and respond to.  The kicker would be they'd have to respond pretty quickly.<p>If I'm looking for X - I may not even know exactly what X is - but I describe X as best I can - few words or exact UPC or whatever - along with my city/location/area, then start getting response/offers back to me within a few minutes.  Perhaps I put a time limit on it - I need to know in the next 30 minutes.  If I get, say, 3 offers back telling me store ABC has it for $y and store DEF has it for $z, I can go to either location, or contact them back and arrange a deal, or just ignore them because it's too high.<p>It's not the instant gratification tied with realtime inventory propose here, but it's a step in the right direction.  And once you have one half built, and see the signals/searches people are putting in, you can more easily convince local retailers to participate.  Perhaps they pay a subscription to review a feed, which they can tie in with automated systems, or they pay a fee on a per response basis (almost like a slowed-down turn by turn google adwords).<p>I'm available to talk about this idea more at mgkimsal@gmail.com if you want  :)",1340102082

The most common issue is with virtualization systems trying to hide the fact that time is being ""stolen"" by the hypervisor and/or other domains.<p>(6) is a case of ""synchronization is really hard"" combined with ""benchmarks measure system performance, not system correctness"".  Most high-performance timing these days involves reading an on-die clock counter, scaling, and adding a base (boot time) value.  For that to work on SMP, the clocks need to be synchronized -- and they don't start that way, since CPU #0 is enabled first and does some hardware probing before it turns the other CPUs on.  Even worse, on many platforms, power-saving features will slow down the clock, resulting in the counters getting out of sync.<p>As alexs says, CLOCK_MONOTONIC <i>should</i> be monotonic... but in reality, it's much faster to return a mostly-good-enough value.  In FreeBSD, in addition to CLOCK_{UPTIME, REALTIME, MONOTONIC}, we have CLOCK_<i>_{FAST, PRECISE} so that applications can choose between accuracy and performance.<p></i>CLOCK_MONOTONIC is what I use for timing quite often. I tend to do soft real time stuff and that clock seems the best suited for my tasks.*<p>As long as you avoid virtualization, turn off all power-saving features, and your ""soft real time"" can tolerate non-monotonicity on the sub-microsecond scale, you should be safe.",1340100546

There's no indication that the bugs found by the fuzzer have become part of the Javascript engine's test cases, but I hope they have.<p>I think we owe a debt of gratitude to Jesse for the work he's done to make Javascript more robust.

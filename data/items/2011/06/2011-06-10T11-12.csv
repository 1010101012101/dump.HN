2640515,comment,2640220,2640384,9,0,roel_v,,,"It would be completely trivial on Windows since mdb files are accessed with the Jet database engine, one would set up a database connection string just like when accessing an Oracle or SQL Server database through ODBC and then use whatever database api is available in one's language of choice (vbscript, javascript (both of them available as 'standard' cscript engines on any installation of Windows since 2001), powershell, visual basic, C++, ...) to extract the data.<p>Or, one would google for 10 seconds like I just did and find for example <a href=""http://timothychenallen.blogspot.com/2007/08/vb-convert-any-access-table-to-csv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timothychenallen.blogspot.com/2007/08/vb-convert-any-...</a> which does that for you and converts the file into a csv file, and then process it like other csv files. No Office or Visual Basic required.<p>So his claim 'this would have taken a couple of hours' (about converting the mdb to csv on Windows) is a load of bollocks and FUD. He didn't even search for it I'd wager, and let his ideologically myopic view cloud his pragmatic judgement. I'm not sure why people are defending this sort of juvenile fanboyism, it's drivel like this that makes the rest of us serious users who propose Linux in situations where it actually <i>is</i> better than the alternatives look like nutcases.",1307707160

The key is that the speed relative to the planet will be the same going in as coming out, however the angle of the trajectory of the spacecraft relative to the planet's orbit can be different.

2640498,comment,2639701,2640417,12,0,bobmoretti,,,"The ""slingshot effect"" or gravity assist involves a vessel robbing angular momentum from a large body.<p>If you launch a vessel towards a planet (so that you come near but don't collide with it), then in the reference frame of the planet your vessel will leave with the same velocity going away from the planet as the velocity of your approach. However, since the planet was moving with respect to the Sun, you will have gained or lost velocity with respect to the Sun, depending on whether your space craft approached from behind or in front of the moving planet. Typically in these assist maneuvers, you wait for a large planet to be a bit ahead of the Earth's orbit. You launch towards that planet, and the gravity assist accelerates the space probe. Some of that acceleration will be tangential (mostly useless to you) but some will be radial, increasing your velocity from the Sun.<p>The Voyager probes took advantage of a once-in-every 180 year planetary alignment, with all of the outer planets mostly aligned. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Voyager_2_path.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Voyager_2_path.png</a> for a good illustration. All the outer planets are traveling in a counter clockwise direction, and you can clearly see the outer planets accelerating Voyager 2 tangentially. It should be clear that there will be a radial component to that acceleration as well.<p>I don't think you can use the Sun in these circumstances; it doesn't have any angular momentum for you to steal.<p>Incidentally, the discovery of this method is sheer brilliance; without using gravity assists it would have taken prohibitively long and required a prohibitive amount of propellant to reach the outer planets.",1307706540

1.  Yes, any storage array should work to first protect the integrity of the data
2.  Yes, a good DR solution is only as good as the testing and tuning that the administrators have done to ensure it is working properly<p>Here are some questions:
-  How many spare drives were in the system when the first and second drive failed?  Netapp does not shut down volumes of storage if spares are in the system to take over for the failed drives.
-  How long was it really before those drives were replaced with a spare that could take over and rebuild?
-  Why don't you publish your DR plan and explain exactly where it didn't go as tested and planned?  Point this out to show where the issue occurred that had been previously tested and shown to work properly.<p>I am not an employee of NetApp and not even a customer of NetApp.  I have used it in the past and like all technologies it requires the care and feeding that is well documented in manuals they provide.  And it requires good administrators to do their jobs to test and monitor things and ensure the resources are available for the system to work as designed.<p>Once you have heard both sides of the story the only thing you learn is that there are more the 2 sides to the story.<p>When these types of things happen the folks closest to them always leave out details or cannibalize the story so that they can be found blameless.  I have been in the IT field for 15 years and seen it time and time again (with many technologies).<p>I read an email from Grasshopper this AM detailing to their customers what this issue was.  It was so vague and left so much to interpretation that it really came across as whiny and misinformed.  It was extremely unprofessional to apologize and then blame (without full explanation or root cause).<p>There's more to this than meets the eye.  Believe me.<p>Since you all are replacing NetApp, I would suggest paying for a full time engineer from the next storage company you buy from.  They can manage the array for you (properly) and ensure these things don't happen.  Otherwise you'll need your sysadmins to start reading product documentation, following best practices, and testing procedures.",1307704543

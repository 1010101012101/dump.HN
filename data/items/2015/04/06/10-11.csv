9327427,comment,9325547,9327400,0,0,tel,,,"I think this is just a vocabulary difference, not a genuine mental one.<p>When I see a ball falling I don&#x27;t think of it moving forward and accelerating in an infinite number of infinitesimal mutations---I see it as being in the state of falling and recognize the space of actions I could perform in time with it. There&#x27;s mutation in the sense that I cannot arbitrarily go back in time. There&#x27;s immutability in the sense that the rules governing that motion are not &quot;staged&quot; in any way outside of the interference of my hand.<p>A better example is perhaps catching a fly ball as an outfielder in baseball. I <i>absolutely</i> cannot be processing that motion as a set of mutations in order to function---instead, I predict according to a &quot;mathematical pattern&quot; if not a formula, where it will land based on scant observation of segments of its space-time trajectory.<p>And that&#x27;s all more or less instinctual, I believe. It must be in order for me as an outfielder to execute my task. That stuff needs to just be built in to my brain.<p>So while ultimately FRP and physics might be &quot;implemented&quot; (ha, ha, philosophers forgive me) in discrete steps, there&#x27;s a vital model of each which is continuous.",1428317483

First, that it&#x27;s easier to teach someone carte blanche to <i>program</i> at some goalpost level of skill via Haskell than other languages. Second, that it&#x27;s easier to teach someone who has no knowledge of programming otherwise to understand Haskell than it is to teach someone with &quot;imperative experience&quot; to understand it.<p>I wonder what your thoughts are these days on each of these. My understanding is that you have the requisite experience to talk about it, like few others!<p>It&#x27;s finally interesting to me to state that I think the best version of that trope, though one that is impractical and untestable, is that it&#x27;s easier to teach a newbie to program Haskell than an experienced Java programmer <i>ignoring some set of standard, non-linguistic training points</i>. This is the most interesting since it gets directly at there being some kind of &quot;imperative mindset impedance&quot; which is presumed to exist, but it&#x27;s the least testable since I&#x27;m certain nobody will ever agree on what those &quot;non-linguistic training points&quot; are.

They strongly reject the label &quot;disability&quot;.<p>&quot;Dan, when someone gives me a document that I can&#x27;t understand, and I tell them that I can&#x27;t understand it, they often say &#x27;well, of course you dont understand it, you are learnig disabled&#x27;.  So what they&#x27;re doing is transferring the blame for the lack of understanding from them to me.  It&#x27;s somehow my problem that I don&#x27;t understand this document.

But I&#x27;m well aware of the messy contradictions surrounding such an issue. Living minimally is a choice you can make when you live in relatively rich country. It&#x27;s not a choice for many millions of others around the world who make do with little because of their circumstances. What&#x27;s more, our economies (certainly &quot;Western&quot; economies) are geared to the production and consumption of goods, if not for our own populations then for export to other countries for them to consume. So can only a small number of us choose to live minimally as long as everyone else decides not to? How else are we going to buy the expensive laptop essential to our minimalist life? (Am I being too cynical?)<p>And does minimal living always equate to sustainable living? If you&#x27;re jetting all over the world in a plane, is that environmentally friendly? Wouldn&#x27;t the locals prefer you spend some of your tourist money on their goods and services so they too can live a comfortable life? Many environmentalists believe the huge amount of resources needed to rear and feed animals is unsustainable. Giving up meat or reducing our consumption could be considered sustainable, but it&#x27;s not what people would consider as part of a minimal lifestyle.<p>And finally, is it really a choice between a consumer/material lifestyle and a minimal lifestyle? Or more realistically, a choice between excessive material consumption (e.g. 70 shirts as stated in the article) or just a more modest material lifestyle?",1428315944

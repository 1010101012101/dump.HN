In both cases, the speakers seemed especially intelligent and cogent, almost like a sage. I always wondered if this was what enabled their success, that is, if their impeccable insight offered them accelerated access to success. Or maybe even that it was the success that enabled their wisdom. Either way, both speakers presented everything in manners that were markedly more insightful than the usual ""fluffy"" answers I'm used to hearing.",1268124512

Different people might learn at different paces, so letting people learn naturally might be a better way for these things to be introduced at the optimal time, rather than forced at some suboptimal time.

So the some children might develop an interest for it at 3rd grade or 2nd, etc. But it would be optimized by interest, and school would serve the purpose of creating the interest (to induce learning), rather than forcing the learning.",1268122294
1177796,comment,1177329,1177329,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I'm actively planning and working towards living to 110 years old - I think it's going to be quite possible. The path is about gradually increasing healthy behaviors and decreasing unhealthy behaviors while looking to eliminate them.<p>So far I've quit cigarettes, recreational drugs, drinking, coffee, pork, beef, and other mammals.<p>I did this in waves - I have a two-fold plan. I quit or seriously cut back on something bad, and/or look to add something equivalent but better to my consumption. So you can't just quit all the foods/drinks you consume without getting used to having new stuff. For instance, I'm working on cutting caffeine, so I axed coffee (and I <i>loved</i> coffee, by the way) and am working to moving to lower caffeinated drinks - green tea, white tea, and herbal teas ideally. Will I quit entirely and go herbal teas, or continue to drink green tea? Not sure, but I'm looking in that direction.<p>I'm working on quitting fructose and sucrose except when they come with a significant amount of fiber and nutrients (so, fruit) - and maybe a possible exception for right after exercise. This means eating more fruit and adding decent snacks and fiber to my diet instead of just quitting and then wondering what the hell to do. Also, I spent all of 2009 trying all kinds of sugar and dessert - I wanted to have those experiences before quitting, and I know I'd need time to prepare for this one since it's such a big thing.<p>I'm working on stretching and fitness programs to my connective tissue, bones, and joints in good shape - especially important for me since I have bad joints. My fitness is light weights focusing on core and large muscle groups, less worried about the ""beach muscles"" and more about core strength, flexibility, and mobility. Also, cardio for the heart.<p>Then taking care of my teeth and skin and constantly looking into how to improve my lymph system, immune system, digestion, and other vital systems in the body.<p>Now, sometimes if I mention this to somebody, they say, ""Man, why bother living if you're having no fun?!"" And I don't really know what to tell them - my happiness/meal I reckon is right around anyone who isn't a serious gastronomical foodie type. I eat fresh fruits, yogurt, nice teas, rice, noodles, chicken, fish, vegetables with nice spices and sauces. Sandwiches and stews and other nice things - do I miss steak or Monte Cristo cigars and Chimay Blue beer sometimes? Yeah, occasionally. But I reckon my happiness/pleasure/consumption of things stacks up nicely with anyone else's.<p>And I plan on having a healthy sex life in my 50's and 60's, and maybe afterwards, I plan on being able to really run around and play some sports with my kids and grandkids, and I plan on being healthy and active for my great-grandkids.<p>I talk to older people and ask them what they'd wished they done when they were younger - they <i>all</i> have regrets, ""I should have taken care of my back... should have taken care of my teeth... should've quit smoking... should've quit drinking... it wasn't worth it..."" And it's like, hey, that's going to be me! I'm going to be that old person with those regrets unless I take action now.<p>Who knows, I do some dangerous stuff, I snowboard, I travel to dangerous parts of the world, maybe I'll catch a bad break and that'll be the end of me. But I tell you, just knowing that I'm planning on living to 110, with good mobility and health and cheer for most of those years, that is worth it for it's own sake even if I don't last that long. I'm planning on living a long, healthy, productive life. That it's own reward - being able to have sex 20 years longer than most people my age will be a bonus, being able to play a decent game of football with my pre-teen grandson will be a bonus, getting 30 to 50 more years to read books, and watch world events unfold, and play with all the cool and amazing new technology that comes out - it's a bonus.

However, with this, offer leniency on individual adhesion. For instance, if someone has an appointment during the day, or needs a half-day, or needs a whole day off, or whatever, and that person has no impending obligations that day, simply require a few minutes of notice and then let it slide without Nazi-tizing the operation.<p>The workplace needs to be concerned with productivity, not draconian enforcement of arcane rulesets. Leniency with the schedule is fine as long as the employee is performing well.<p>It is good to keep general office hours. Fried's approach as quoted here seems naive and reactionary to me; we've all worked at places where hours have received far too much emphasis, but the right solution isn't doing away with them completely because there's a lot of benefit for everyone involved (clients, company, employees) in having generally-followed hours.<p>Generally-adhered-to office hours benefit everyone. It's good to have everyone in the same space. It fosters relationships, it results in collaborative creative spurts, not to mention the personal benefits of getting out of the house, ""grown-up"" time without distraction or the normal demands at home with the family, and so on.<p>The right solution is compassionate enforcement and a focus on productivity and morale, not absolute compliance with pre-defined generalized rules.<p>One of my old employers operated almost this way and it was totally awesome ... until the forward-thinking, ex-NSA programmer boss got supplanted by the business-school manufacturing executive.

Chances are that such folks will do good work pretty much regardless of any formal process, but working out a system that maximizes their productivity, reduces their stress, and increases their job satisfaction can be very important. Often these tend to be ""non-traditional"" systems or even unique solutions depending on the various traits of the individual, sometimes people have different ways of working. These are the sort of 99th percentile workers that would be running their own startup if they weren't working with you, they work because they love it and they are not just cogs they are artists, their work is creative and creative work often requires non-traditional work environments and hours.<p>Second, for individuals with average talent and average individual motivation process tends to be more important. Indeed, process is often a critical element in the success or failure of teams that are primarily composed of average workers, whether developers or otherwise. Many of the non-traditional work environments and work rules that translate into success for 99th percentile workers will result in catastrophic failure when applied to groups composed mostly of average developers.<p>This is what makes generic advice so difficult. Advice that applies to one group will frequently cause consternation and failure in the other. The advice of Jason Fried, coming from 37signals, often applies only to the first group. Both Jason's advice and this critique from MetaLab are perfectly valid but neither is suitable as blanket advice for every developer across all skill levels and in any organization.<p>People need to first understand that there is no one-size-fits-all process that will maximize developer productivity in every situation and that different processes are necessary for different skill levels, personalities, and levels of individual motivation. Once that is understood then they can move forward towards figuring out what sorts of work environments and schedules work best for each individual.",1268121709

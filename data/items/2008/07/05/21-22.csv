237329,comment,236853,237001,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Mountain View is indeed expensive but $110K is $50K more than the average household income in the Bay Area. Aside from packing 3 people to a cube, Google pampers its employees above and beyond almost any other company in the area. There is free food, health insurance, free gym, free laundry, free haircuts and so forth. Taking this into account, a Google employee doesn't have to spend much money on anything other than rent, transportation and food for the kid. Even if renting a $3000/m apartment and leasing a Lexus a Google employee making $110K a year would still have $50K a year left over. ""Making ends meet"" perhaps isn't the most accurate way to describe the situation these people face.",1215294368

Experiences are not always under your control and therefore you can't always repeat them even if they are true. This is true in relationships with other humans and it seems likely that it would also be true with a personal god.<p>Let's say your girlfriend does something nice for you and you feel like you love her for it. Let's say she then dumps you for hottie that doesn't even know how to code and never talks to you again. You can't repeat that experience with her because her free choice made it possible. That doesn't mean that the experience was fake, it just means that it is outside of your control.<p>I'm sure there are some wholes in that logic, but hopefully it was able to shed some extra light on the subject.",1215294319

Being written in PHP also means that you are not limited in hosting.<p>If you're a startup creating a single web app, then fine, use Python with mod_wsgi or Rails and five mongrel servers. But if you're creating basic CRUD websites, especially more than one, then there is nothing wrong with PHP. I can fit dozens of low-traffic websites on a $20/mo 256MB RAM server using Apache and mod_php; try doing that with Rails.<p>As I said, if I was going to focus on a single <i>web app</i> with its own dedicated server, then I would definitely look at Python and mod_wsgi, but since I create a lot of 'smaller' websites (nothing too complex), it is much less of a hassle using PHP since I can fit all of them nicely on a single, cheap server.",1215293567

237312,comment,236747,237179,0,0,time_management,,,"The S&P, which models a portfolio of 500 large-cap stocks weighted by market cap, is adjusted for splits and dividends. Splits effect neither the index value nor the weights, and dividends are implicitly assumed to go back into the portfolio, altering the weights but not the cash value. So what the S&P tracks is the performance of this portfolio, with cash dividends immediately reinvested. In other words, the returns calculated include dividends.<p>The S&P index is a damn good measure of market performance, since, although only 500 stocks are included, it comprises about 80% of US equities by market cap. (Wiltshire 5k is theoretically better, but the practical difficulties in index arbitrage on 5000 stocks, many illiquid, make S&P futures more popular.) The Dow, on the other hand, is a terrible index. It's not weighted for market caps, which means that if a Dow company splits its shares, its weight in the index declines, for no good reason.",1215293481

How does that balloon into ""put off having kids until things are perfect""?<p>Of course, there are extenuating circumstances which can waylay any planning; I never intended to imply that there weren't.  Go back and read my post, and you'll see that my criticism was conditional.  If you did have a plan in place, and then extenuating circumstances derailed those plans, then fine.<p>Twice now you've taken statements that were pointed at a specific issue and acted as if they were broad indictments of your parenting skills that amounted to nothing more than ad hominem attacks.

237309,comment,236808,236808,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I would say by and large ""geeks"" subscribe to Occam's Razor, meaning the simplest self-consistent explanatory theory for a given explendum tends to be correct. If the explendum, is, for example, the Universe, then Occam's Razor would point to a well-defined, self-consistent theory of quantum gravity (as yet not entirely done), then positing say, the flying spaghetti monster. If ""God"" is defined as some sort of disembodied ""macro-intelligence"" then said notion becomes a casulty of Occam's Razor. If however, ""God"" is co-terminous with Nature, or the Universe, or the ""creativity"" of nature as some would have it, which I would take to mean emergent forms or fluctuations spontaneously arising from a system in thermal equlibrium in the macro-scale, then one can carry on using the word ""God"", without running into Occam's Razor. Personally I prefer the word ""pantheist"" to ""atheist"", meaning the former term is ""glass half full"" whereas the latter term is ""glass half empty"".",1215293426

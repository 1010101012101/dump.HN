I've noticed a good vibe on YC, and I also enjoy using IRC (most often on #joiito on freenode). Is there a good IRC channel where a lot of startuppers go?",1180137378

Its intention is definitely to make google look less desirable.<p>Apparently this meetup ceo guy has a reputation for attacking others; most of the entries are unprovoked attacks on other companies (for instance, he rails on SixApart because they're offering a non-blog page-creation tool on TypePad).",1180135344

This means you can use version control with impunity and not worry about giving bad code to colleagues. You can commit a broken work-in-progress without harming anything. You can also create branches with impunity and not have to worry about naming conflicts, polluting the space of branch names, etc. If something turns out to be a bad idea, you just zap it and nobody ever has to know.<p>I can do all those things without involving the source control system, so what do I get by involving the source control system?  For example, why would I want to commit broken code?  What does a local commit do for me?<p>In most cases, ""distributed"" is a necessary evil that folks work to hide, with varying degrees of success.",1234922348

485244,comment,482257,484130,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>Do you really think 80% of government health care money is wasted? [Citation Needed]</i><p>The Singapore government spends 1.3% of GDP on health care and the private sector spends around 2% of GDP.  Overall, their health indicators are slightly better than our indicators in America.  The U.S. government spends 7% of GDP on health care and the private sector spends another 7%.  The delta between what the U.S. spends and what I think would be spent with a well run system is what I consider the waste.  Singapore is an example of much better run system that exists in the real world.  It's not an 80% difference in spending, but it's close.<p><i>Most study's suggest that private inshurance is less efficient than public spending so I am not really sure what your talking about there.</i><p>I do not find that surprising.  ""Private"" healthcare in the U.S. is really a system of government licensed cartels.  The nurses unions, AMA, insurance companies, drug companies, big hospitals, etc have all manipulated the political system to drive up the cost of care.<p><i>In 1900 the recorded homicide rate in the US was under 2 per 100,000. 3.7 is about twice that and today Milwaukee has a little over twice the national homicide rate.</i><p>The crime rate for Milwaukee statistic was from 1911, the immigration stat was from 1900, since I couldn't find one from 1900.<p>You can ( and I have) read accounts from the time, and the difference in crime and levels of decay becomes even more apparent.  Read <i>How the Other Half Lives</i> and then compare it to <i>The Corner</i> or <i>Gang leader for a day</i>.<p>Either way, the point stands - these cities, with a high proportion of poor immigrants, did not have anything like the underclass problem that exists in the same cities today.",1234920594

But how do they get back to the cart once they've closed the lightbox? Clicking the buy button again reveals just one item in the cart. So in essence closing the lightbox means ""discard this cart"" rather than ""continue shopping"", right?
That means your findings only work for pages that have one single item for sale (or items similar enough that buyers only want to purchase one of them, as in your case).<p>Your sample size is also quite low (94% increase = from 8 conversions to 15), and you're using absolute values in the graphs.

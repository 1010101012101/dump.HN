I've experienced it in periods of my own life, depending on how financially secure I've felt - and so far as I can tell, my intelligence hasn't changed. Abraham Maslow discussed the psychology behind this half a century ago. (1)<p>Of course there are many other issues affecting the poor, which this article doesn't address and which you completely ignore. The fact is that it's simply more expensive to be poor. Not having a car can mean you might have to sacrifice an entire day of work just to take your child to the doctor by bus (and this isn't an abstract hypothetical - I've treated these families). When you don't have extra money you sacrifice income to late fees, pay higher interest rates, are unable to benefit for long-term or bulk discounts. And don't even get me started on predatory services like check cashing or rent to own companies.<p>Bottom line, it's cheap to be rich, and expensive to be poor. And when every day is a struggle you see the world differently than a high paid yuppy with a secure tech job in an otherwise miserable economy (that's not a personal jab, I put myself in this category as well).<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs</a>",1309042330

2696811,comment,2696283,2696283,13,0,chrismealy,,,"Mike Konczal:<p>Heres the normal story. Picture you are in a room with 10 people. Each of them has a slice of cake. How much you are willing to pay for a slice of the cake is the marginal utility of having it, and the more cake you have the less any more cake is worth to you. Youd be willing to pay a $1 for the first slice of cake, but youd only be will to pay 90 cents for the second slice. Youd only be willing to pay 10 cents for the 9th slice, and a penny for the 10th slice. Eating the 10th slice of cake in that room would probably make you sick, hence you want it a lot less than the first slice, which is delicious. Thats declining marginal utility.<p>Now picture you are in a room with 10 people screaming. You hate it when people scream, and you can pay a person to get them to stop screaming. Would you pay in a similar way to the cake example? Would you pay a $1 to get the first person to stop screaming, and a penny for the 10th person to stop screaming?<p>No. Getting one person to stop screaming would make very little difference in how much you dislike being in the room. Modern psychology tells us you might not even notice it. Youd probably only pay a penny to get that first guy to stop screaming. However getting the second guy to stop screaming might be worth 10 cents. And the last guy, the difference between some screaming and no screaming, might be worth the full dollar to you. The more quiet it got, the more a marginal difference in how quiet it is would be worth to you. Theres increasing returns to this good; the 10th guy not screaming is worth more than the first guy not screaming, which is the exact opposite dynamic of the 10th cake being less delicious than the first.<p>-- <a href=""http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2009/12/03/persistence-of-poverty-and-increasing-marginal-utility/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2009/12/03/persistence-of-pov...</a>",1309042224

2696808,comment,2696283,2696672,2,0,daniel-cussen,,,">""The basis of their diet, therefore, is white bread and margarine, corned beef, sugared tea and potatoes -- an appalling diet. Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread or if they even, like the writer of the letter to the New Statesman, saved on fuel and ate their carrots raw? Yes, it would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn't. When you are unemployed  you don't want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit ""tasty."" There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you.""<p>So, calories, or not enough of them.  Cooked food has more net calories than uncooked food.

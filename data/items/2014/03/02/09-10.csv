7328508,comment,7245205,7248387,1,0,strictfp,,,"I see where you&#x27;re coming from, but I don&#x27;t really agree with your conclusions. Yes, authoritarian regimes will keep trying to subvert freedom and abuse friendly initiatives. But the real question for me is whether we need to listen to them or not. Why not just ignore them? Maybe they can get the source for some business system in a successful financial company. But they will most likely never be able to replicate that company, so why bother? Maybe the freedom that an open internet gives is worth the downsides? I mean, it has worked thus far.<p>Weapon systems and other national security is another thing entirely. Here I&#x27;m all for heightened security with the whole shebang: physically separate networks, drives in safes, you name it.<p>Industrial espionage is a borderline case. Here you might want to heighten security for vulnerable companies, especially the ones working under government contracts. The good news is that these are most likely easily identifiable entities. You could maintain a list of high-profile companies who would have to follow stricter security routines. I&#x27;m sure this happens already in the real world, so why not use the same type of policies for internet security?<p>But I would really like to avoid bringing war mentality onto the open internet. Just like you, I think that the 27-page checklist is completely unrealistic.<p>> Having citadels of security in a floating maelstrom of unprotected Internet is not security at the national level.<p>No it&#x27;s not. But why would you need the national level security? I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m buying you point about the internet itself being &quot;critical infrastructure&quot;. If the army want&#x27;s to claim the whole internet &quot;just in case&quot;, then fine, introduce national borders. But isn&#x27;t it better if all countries work together to make the internet stronger as a whole, and not abusable (prevent these NTP-based DDos attacks for instance)?<p>The difference is that I don&#x27;t think that introducing borders are a good long-term strategy. The example which you bring up about anti-USA propaganda is a good one I think. Because what I see in younger generations is a whole new skillset: the ability to see through propaganda, ads and other manipulative media. Thanks to the internet young people can receive several subjective messages and still form their own opinions. Being on the internet exposes you to trolls, liars, false information, propaganda and phishing attempts every day. And people get better at forming their own opinions.<p>What I&#x27;ve seen over here in Europe regarding pro- and anti-America propaganda once free information was introduces was the following: First people stopped believing the US hype. The US wasn&#x27;t such a great place after all. Weaknesses such as poverty and gang violence was exposed. Secondly, anti-american propaganda came in from the east. This was listened to to some extent, but pretty soon it became clear that these guys weren&#x27;t completely honest themselves. And after 9/11 and the Madrid  bombings, I don&#x27;t think anyone think highly of eastern propaganda anymore. Lastly, more information started to flow in from the &quot;real US&quot;. Not sitcoms or fox news, but sites like Reddit and hacker news exposed people to the daily lives of americans. And people started to bond and understand one another. And this is what I think is the power of the internet. If we know each other on the small scale, the large scale fights just won&#x27;t happen. If the news tells me that Kiev is full of terrorists and war makers, I can just happily ignore that having seen live feeds and talked to the people on chats over the internet. It is worth considering, IMO, just how much this communication is worth. It could be that the Internet is the best enabler of Democratic peace that we&#x27;ve seen this far. Maybe so good that democracy isn&#x27;t even required for enabling &quot;democratic&quot; peace. And borders could ruin that. For proof, just look at dictatorships. They see this power in social media and are deadly scared of it. They&#x27;re scrambling for the power to shut it down at will.<p>> Look around the Internet and all I see is Europeans calling us fat, making fun of how we measure distance, write and speak our dates (and all this despite American coders at MS being careful to add locale and translation support to their software), and more or less begging for us to take any overseas extension we have back to America.<p>This is just little brother teasing big brother. It&#x27;s not serious IMO.<p>>While I will say that I do prefer an international, open network just as you do<p>Well then, let&#x27;s think up a strategy which would work without building borders between countries! While isolation is the fastest fix, I think it could be worth it if we could find better ones.",1393754017

7328503,comment,7325534,7328330,1,0,Dylan16807,,,"> This is the code that gives us the classic buffer overflow vulnerability all because checking for a length isn&#x27;t elegant.<p>The few characters it would take to check length didn&#x27;t effect this API, it was just part of the decision to use null terminated strings instead of storing lengths.<p>>Also, how does this code work if what one of those pointers points to are declared volatile? What if both pointers point to volatile things?<p>I can&#x27;t imagine any way in which volatile would cause problems.  What are you pondering?  strcpy doesn&#x27;t take volatile pointers anyway.<p>> What happens if one of those pointers crosses through 0 because it rolled over from max?<p>That&#x27;s just a very specific type of buffer overflow.  strcpy is the wrong function to use in such a scenario.<p>> Thanks. I doubt you could have provided a better example of the precise problem.<p>strcpy is for very specific situations.  Writing it in a simple way isn&#x27;t the problem.  It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s even theoretically possible for strpy to avoid overflowing.  It doesn&#x27;t have enough information, only two pointers.<p>In short, this is a bad <i>API</i>, it is not a bad <i>implementation</i>.",1393753942

This is like complaining that your Mercedes was too expensive when you could have bought a more reliable and efficient car for less money.<p>The article states that the average year at college today costs $18,497, yet this guy is going to rack up $400k in dept over 6 years? by my math that is $111k.

I think having children is one of the biggest impacts someone can have on their life, both financially and mentally. How is this going to affect the business?

The cfo initially refused to go along. Of course some of it was due to his desire to keep cost down, as every good cfo should. But then he joked every dollar saved would mean more for his christmas bonus. we were a small/friendly company so I guess that&#x27;s why he felt it was ok to joke about it. But I do believe his ultimate reason was to keep cost down at any &#x27;cost&#x27; so that his bonus check would be bigger, as his performance is evaluated on how he manages the cash flow.<p>What the cfo didn&#x27;t see was the productivity gain that could be gained by the programmers having bigger monitors. And these programmers were making near 6-figure salary. Their combined man hour cost was greater than his. But a cfo was making a decision to fatten his bonus check. Obviously this was not a good choice for the firm to make but it had been going on for awhile until the new senior programmer spoke up.<p>And I think this kind of logic in executive suite is probably common everywhere.<p>Lastly, I think it&#x27;s about time these big tech companies add profit sharing ON top of the base salary as part of the compensation package.

You have a web service for developers, and you want human-editable config files that can be parsed safely on the server side.

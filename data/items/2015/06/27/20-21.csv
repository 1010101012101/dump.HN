So SF can continue to host and enjoy links on unmaintained websites, search engines etc.<p>Note 2: If their business model is offering popular binaries and source, they can just copy these from other sites and repackage them. Open source software allows you to do this. If no one else is interesting in bundling and monetizing, then they can buy traffic and still succeed.<p>Note 3: Remember that academy award winning movie from 1943? Not so great it today&#x27;s light. While perhaps one of the goals of the Internet and cheap storage is to keep a copy of everything, and its often better to <i>not</i> re-invent the wheel, if something fall by the wayside, and its needed, it will be created.<p>Note 4: There are plenty of websites which catalog useful abandonware, that someone had to find a physical disk drive from.

I would no more be surprised to learn that Young genuinely thinks what he is quoted as arguing, than I would be to see, say, yet another misinterpretation of p-values in a peer-reviewed published research article or yet another article where the power is closer to 0% than 100% & the results near-meaningless or another study with scores of described hypothesis tests and no consideration of false-positive issues or any of the dreary litany of problems we all know about.<p>Being a published biology researcher does not make one an instant meta-analyst, qualified to say that there is no need for any additional replications (to say <i>that</i> sort of thing, you should be drawing on something like a trial sequential analysis indicating futility of additional studies, not saying &#x27;well it seems to me like one (successful) replication of my result is enough and this second replication is a waste&#x27;).",1435438677

Personally, I think this has more to do with the types of guarantees (or lack thereof) that node gives you on the backend. I see a lot of rails and jvm language backends for building services these days. You might want to consider familiarizing yourself with the jvm and picking up clojure or scala.<p>I tested out go for a couple months and found it to be a very interesting language , but I still wouldn&#x27;t build a rest api with it unless that api was very simple. Its a great language for many things, but I can&#x27;t imagine a lot of people are using it to build larger mvc service based applications and don&#x27;t see this happening for the foreseeable future.",1435438630

If an attacker is already in the network, I think we need to distinguish between two types of boxes. Servers, and clients. Honeypots are nothing new, so having a few servers that are honeypots in the network doesn&#x27;t seem that interesting to me.<p>If someone wants to break into your network, they&#x27;ll probably target a small amount of users and try to get a RAT on their box to spread from their, I don&#x27;t know but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d do.<p>If you want honeypot Clients, things get a bit harder, since you will need to mimic user interaction. But even if a box clicks every link for a decoy email account a drive-by exploit or something can easily fingerprint the system and bail out if it&#x27;s a VM since it&#x27;s unlikely for clients to be VMs. Depending on the exploit, that could be hard to detect.<p>So, we&#x27;re back to honeypots as servers?

Despite Singapore&#x27;s best efforts to forcibly integrate immigrants (i.e. racial quotas on public housing blocks) Sg has a race problem. They had their first race riot since the 60s last year. It was incited by a Chinese truck driver injuring an Indian laborer in the relatively impoverished Indian district of the city. The coverage from the Strait Times might be interesting to you: <a href=""http://www.straitstimes.com/little-india-riot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straitstimes.com/little-india-riot</a><p>>Both were, nevertheless, the law, and he broke both repeatedly, including breaking bail.\nNo one is disputing whether Amos broke the law. It&#x27;s more of a question of whether the laws are intended to keep people safe or control public opinion. Everyone knows about the libel prosecution of political threats, but the PAP&#x27;s crusade of information control goes far beyond that. Protests are essentially illegal. Dissent is illegal. When I studied at NUS for a semester, I was forced to sign a waiver going through customs that stated, along with many other conditions, that I wouldn&#x27;t criticize the government in any way, online or off. Singapore is an extremely thoroughly policed country, and riots are just not an acceptable excuse for draconian policy.<p>>By the way, congratulations on the first HN Singapore thread that does not mention chewing gum!\ninb4 someone excuses the human rights violations by fawning over how excellent their metro system is. weev went into my Twitter mentions to do this once.",1435438581

A &quot;senior engineer&quot; might become a &quot;lead engineer&quot; or just an &quot;engineer&quot; at a different company—which means there&#x27;s no objective measurement going on there.<p>I much prefer a guild-like system for measuring actual aptitude:<p>• <i>apprentices</i> know one thing well enough to do it (the average &quot;Java developer&quot;);<p>• <i>journeymen</i> have a good picture of the field, know what &quot;the best tool for the job&quot; is in most cases (even if they don&#x27;t <i>know</i> that tool), and have the meta-skill required to <i>efficiently</i> pick up a new language/framework/paradigm/whatever else in order to solve a problem that requires it;<p>• <i>masters</i> have enough experience to flinch away from bad design/architecture. They&#x27;ve been burned by every <i>category</i> of problem it&#x27;s been possible to be burned by, such that they have a complete high-level picture of all the moment-to-moment considerations involved in &quot;the art.&quot; They know <i>what questions to ask</i> about a proposed pull request to determine its quality. To get here, they&#x27;ve likely completed a major &quot;masterpiece&quot; work on their own, and maintained it under heavy use by others.<p>These aren&#x27;t categories that match social standing, or seniority, or experience, per se. In fact, they don&#x27;t even form a tight match to the kind of &quot;skill&quot; people look for in job ads; you can become a &quot;master&quot; at 15 if you accidentally build something really popular, even though you still need a cheat sheet to remind you what&#x27;s in your language&#x27;s stdlib.<p>But these categories <i>are</i> able to be objectively fit to people (it&#x27;s pretty clear in which one a particular person sits); they can be carried between organizations with no loss of meaning; each category is a strict superset of the skills of the former; and they tell you something that&#x27;s very useful to know.<p>Interestingly, it would be fully possible to set up an educational curriculum that could make every graduate a &quot;master&quot; by the criteria above.

9791465,comment,9790437,9790437,0,0,x0054,,,"I tend to agree that the biology papers often lack proper documentation of procedures and methodologies. This is a wonderful effort to reproduce some of the key experiments. That being said, I think it&#x27;s also very important to look at the quality and qualifications of the labs doing the reproductions.<p>I don&#x27;t have any direct link to cancer research, so I can&#x27;t speak with authority on the subject, but I have been involved in the past with a company working in the Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis field.<p>The basics of their procedure is to create one or more human embryos via IVF, incubate the embryos for up to 6 days, than either freeze them, or transplant them into the prospective mother. On day 3 or 5 of incubations the embryo is biopsied, and the genetic material is tested to make sure there are no aneuploidy defects. We were also able to test for some other types of genetic abnormalities. This is for people who are having problem becoming pregnant.<p>In any case, some time in the mid 2000s there were 3 papers published in Europe claiming that performing biopsy on Day 3 is extremely detrimental to the embryo, and their conclusion was that PGD with Day 3 should not be performed. The experiments were conducted by people who were unskilled in micro manipulation.<p>They did follow proper protocols, and I am sure they did their best to replicate proper procedures. But micro manipulation is as much skill as it is knowledge. For instance, I can write a detailed procedure on how to shoot a compound bow, and you can follow that procedure exactly. But, without practice, you are not going to hit the bullseye on the first try.<p>Because we were in the business of providing services to doctors, not publishing papers, we constantly tracked our embryo mortality rates, birth rates, and accuracy of testing. The better our results were, the more business we would get. And we couldn&#x27;t fake the results, because clinics ordering the test would be the once recording all of those statistics for us.<p>Any way, long story short, none of our data agreed with the papers claiming that Day 3 biopsy was detrimental to the embryo. In fact, quite the contrary, many of our statistics suggested that Day 3 biopsy and Day 4 or Day 5 transfer would result in better implantation rates. But, the papers were published, and referenced, and then it became &quot;common knowledge&quot; that Day 3 biopsy is bad, and the medical industry moved on to Day 5 biopsy and embryo cryopreservation, and so has the company I worked with.<p>To the company I worked for it&#x27;s all the same, money is money. Day 3 or Day 5 biopsy, they make money all the same. But the patients are not more limited. From the stats we have seen, it doesn&#x27;t look like Day 4 or 5 biopsy is worse for the embryo, but being frozen isn&#x27;t a walk in the park. With Day 5 biopsy you have to freeze the embryo, in order to allow time for the test results to come back.<p>Any way, it&#x27;s my 2 cents. Reproducibility is important, but I think it&#x27;s just as important to change the incentives of those who publish papers. If you goal is to be published, then of course your research will suffer. It&#x27;s the publish or parish mentality in academia that is the problem, I think.",1435437673

I believe that Qt did just that, for example. So this is a subset of C++.<p>> * Inner classes automatically have a reference to the containing class (not in C++, though Java &quot;nested classes&quot;[1] behave similar to C++ structs/classes).<p>That&#x27;s a good example of simple sugar. Inner class just have pointer to the outer class and constructor with this parameter. Java compiler emits this code automatically. Yes, there&#x27;s no such thing in C++, but it&#x27;s very simple to emulate.<p>> * C++ has pass-by-reference semantics which is completely missing in Java.\n> * C++ supports destructors intrinsically.\n> * All definitions must exist within a type in Java. There is no concept of a &quot;free standing&quot; definition.\n> * Java does not support stack-based allocation except for built-in POD&#x27;s.<p>Yes, Java is subset of C++ in that regard. C++ has more features which were stripped out.<p>> * java.lang.ClassLoader has no corresponding abstraction in C++.\n> * Java provides meta-objects by way of java.lang.Class for all classes (not present in C++).<p>Actually those systems could be emulated more or less in C++. Windows does have COM (and there are a lot of less known, but similar systems) which allows to dynamically load classes with virtual methods, etc. Qt implements (with some preprocessor magic) reflection for C++. But generally yes, C++ does not have any kind of runtime reflection (except dynamic_cast) and dynamic code loading, I agree here. What I want to point out is, that those features are provided by JVM. Java as a language does not have anything related to reflection or class loading. So probably it&#x27;s not fair to compare Java + JVM to C++.<p>> As an aside, it has always cracked me up that a language touted as having no pointers has a &quot;NullPointerException&quot; class. (I am easily amused)<p>That&#x27;s very unfortunate mess of terms. Pointers should be pointers, even if there&#x27;s no pointer arithmetic in the language.

I&#x27;m still trying to not be blinded by my idealism but is there really any value in making source proprietary if it&#x27;s a SaaS business?  Would GitHub&#x27;s popularity be affected appreciably if it were closed?  Google&#x27;s?<p>I remain hopeful that the standard SaaS business model dovetails nicely with free and open source software.",1435435581

I believe this started with the advent of Rails where some things seemed &quot;magical&quot; at first due to Ruby&#x27;s meta-programming features. Many writers and speakers have adopted it since.<p>However, there is nothing occult about software development and we shouldn&#x27;t use &quot;magic&quot; as an excuse for not understanding or describing things thoroughly.

As I understand things, biology experiments are still a matter of craft, of doing things by hand.

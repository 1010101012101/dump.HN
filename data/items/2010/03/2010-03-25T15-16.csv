For the unpredictablility, if global, any portion of the application can modify the values.  This means you don't have any access control or format enforcement.  This leads to the potential of unintended changes at any point in the application (say, the level was changed somewhere else) and you now have to catch all possible changes in the game loop rather than providing the proper update on assignment.<p>On 3, I had to read through the code several times to even make sure the last loop would run for each object.  You could have one loop (with one inner loop) and perform the updates (one was 1 line, the other 3-4 if I remember right) and keep the same clarity.  It can also be performance impacting given too many objects.<p>On 4, some of them are subjective (the rbc/wbc for sure), but letters are free and these are being used as code samples.<p>Code reviews are always subjective, but if it's going to be a code sample, it should stand on its own using best practices and comments when they're not reasonable to follow.  Given the sample, I'd ask things like ""how does it perform with 1000 game objects?"" I hope I didn't give the impression I thought it was bad, it just has some common mistakes that, given a project of larger scope, would quickly become unmaintainable without lots of effort.",1269532782

I have to pay a good portion of my Stanford tuition somehow or another, but I could see you determing that that's not ""need.""

I could get a real job (and make >$5k). I could hang out with my friends every day.<p>Do you really expect college students, most of whom have little money, to line up to forgo ~$10k of income (roughly the amount you can make at a programming internship, varying wildly of course) so they can do an open source project?<p>Sure, it would probably be more fun; it would be have completely flexible hours; you might not end up quite having to work full-time on it. But still. I'm a lot more likely to do it if I at least get a good portion of the compensation I could get from working.<p>And even if you do find people to do it, the quality of people will be a lot worse. For the most part, you'll get the people who <i>don't</i> have an opportunity cost of $10k because they're not good enough at programming to land a good job over the summer. So you'd probably just end up wasting a lot of the mentors' time because you'd have to accept lower-quality people.

The risks of developing a game are:<p>* Technical. Modern games of the retail console variety are incredibly complex pieces of technology. I would not be surprised if building an MMO was comparable to designing a car in terms of engineering effort expended. If your schedule slips, you need to rework major pieces of code just so your engine is no longer dated.<p>* Artistic/Creative. The game world needs to be interesting, believable and engaging. Asset production is very expensive. Let your schedule slip, and it will all feel dated.<p>* Gameplay. The game needs to be fun! This is much, much harder than it looks.<p>* Market. Distribution is incredibly hard, and even very good games often fly under the radar. Is your game the genre of the month? Is
it fun enough that everyone talks about it? etc<p>Very rarely is someone great at all 4. I'm reasonably good at #1 & #3 and hopeless at #2, and average at #4.If you manage to somehow succeed at all four points, then you have a game that makes essentially a one time income of $x (it's spread out over a few years, but it spikes high and rapidly diminishes). Hopefully you made a profit!<p>And that's <i>per game</i>. All you need to do is mess up your next game (for instance by being too ambitious and letting your success get to your head), and you're bankrupt.  The trouble is that you're essentially engineering new products each year or two. There's none of that nice, slow maturation of product and increased customer base you may get if you make, eg, bug tracking or database software, operating systems etc. Each release is potentially a very big, maybe-the-company-won't-survive flop.<p>There are a lot of companies that are established enough that they can survive on their fan base and income, but they're the exception, not the rule.

1218605,comment,1217839,1217839,0,0,thwarted,,,"One thing that I couldn't find mentioned is exactly what the pixel addressability is on the display.  In figure 2, the layout of the first two rows is (using RR and BB for the double-wide subpixels):<p><pre><code>   RR G BB G RR G BB G RR G BB G RR G BB G RR G BB G
   BB G RR G BB G RR G BB G RR G BB G RR G BB G RR G
</code></pre>
Is the upper left pixel in this (RR G BB), which the article seems to assert, or (RR G BB G) ?  If I set the screen to entirely black and turn on pixel (0,0), which subpixels will light up (I don't find Figure 1 shows this well enough)?  If (0,0) lights up (RR G BB), then the second pixel at (1,0) is (BB G RR) and overlaps the first?  If it doesn't overlap, then the second G from the left in the first row is not part of any pixel.  If one pixel is composed of two green half-sized subpixels and one each of red and blue full-sized subpixels, then the ratio of screen area to colored subpixels actually is the same for all pixels, it's just that the green subpixel is spread out more and the order of the subpixels is different in each row -- the later would undermine traditional, plain subpixel smoothing that assume a consistent, regular layout on all rows.<p>Notice that if you count subpixel groupings in figure 2, it's exactly 5 pixels across if you use (xx G yy G) subpixel layout (where xx and yy are either RR or BB depending on which row the pixel is on).<p>I find this paragraph confusing considering the layout given:<p><i>You can see from the photo above that each logical pixel on the Nexus One screen contains one green subpixel and either one double-width blue subpixel or one double-width red subpixel. So the red and blue color channels on the Nexus One display each have half as many subpixels (480</i>800/2) as the green channel. Basically, half the red and half the blue spatial information in the 2D image being sent to the display is simply thrown away or spread to the nearest matching subpixel by a convolution or intensity-dispersion process.*<p>And if (xx G yy G) defines one pixel, then this paragraph's math is just plain wrong:<p><i>One way to count raw pixels, ignoring the effect of all the signal processing on the PenTile display, is to calculate total effective RGB triplets on the screen. You can do this by taking a weighted sum of total number of red, blue and green subpixels, and then converting back to an effective screen size. The total number of effective physical pixels, counted using a weighted sum, is (480</i>800/2)<i>2/3 + (480</i>800)<i>1/3 = 256,000, exactly two thirds the claimed total number of pixels (480</i>800=384,000). This is equivalent to a screen with edge dimensions sqrt(256/384)=82% of the claimed length, or (480<i>82%)</i>(800<i>82%) = 392</i>653 = 256k.*<p>... as the ratio of the <i>areas</i> of each of the subpixels is the same, at least in figure 2.<p>If green has more prominence in the way the human eye picks up color, then it actually makes sense to spread out the green over separate areas (or different shaped areas) to give greater prominence to the harder to pick up colors of red and blue, which are more concentrated and thus brighter/richer.  It seems from figure 1, the subpixel smoothing takes into account that the red and blue subpixels are ordered differently.  It's also possible that the subpixel smoothing recognizes that the alternating ordering of red and blue can be exploited along the vertical axis to achieve the following layout (this is two pixels side by side):<p><pre><code>   RR G BB G
   BB G RR G
</code></pre>
which is also the same total subpixel area per pixel, but the whole pixels are more square (1.5 subpixels wide by 2 pixels high vs 3 subpixels (6 half-sizes) wide by 1 pixel high).<p>I personally don't see ""waviness"" in the lines on the screen, but I do see some stippling at the screen edges (easiest to see on an almost fully white lit screen, like the background (not the white border) of the HN content area).  This would seem to be caused by the ordering change of R and B subpixels, not of the half-wide G subpixels.",1269530758

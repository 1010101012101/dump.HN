I was working as a mortgage broker (back then it was a good business) and my friend was working at a restaurant. I would get off work at 5 or so and my co-founder left work at 11-12.<p>So 4 nights a week we would meet at kinko's at 1am and work until about 4 am together. I would sleep for a few hours early morning and I'd also sleep for a few hours after I got home from work.<p>We weren't coding, just writing a business plan. We actually won an SBA business plan contest and got a little money to start the company. This was definitely the craziest hours that I've ever worked.",1206370634

144585,comment,144390,144390,0,0,iamwil,,,"I've also noticed a lack of interesting articles on the front page ever since pg's ""troll"" essay.  The current general hubbub over zoo vs savanna comparisons takes up too many slots.<p>I think there are a couple ways to go.  One thing to try is to show points, but no upvoting on the front page, and allow voting on the 'new' section, but no point totals.  That way, articles that that get upvoted are interesting articles from people browsing new articles. Without the influence of points tallys, people will be voting more or less independently.<p>As it stands now, social news isn't a 'wisdom of the crowds' sort of thing, but more like a positive feedback system that relies on a catchy title and a chance on the front page.  This probably makes it more of a hit-or-miss for good articles.<p>Secondly, as any community gets bigger, the common ground between them gets smaller.  There was some quote about television being stupid and inane, not because people that watch it are stupid and inane, but that the common interests we have are stupid, but our refined tastes are varied.<p>I find myself upvoting very little on the front page now, and the I have to spend time scouring the 'new' section to find the interesting stuff.  To be honest, I see no reason why we shouldn't fragment the top news.  This isn't like a newspaper where we only have one page to print on.  However, I don't mean, breaking it up into ""subHNs"" like reddit did.<p>I mean, I should be able to alter the weighing of the front page.  The simplest scheme would be to allow a user to follow certain people's submits.  I regularly like nickb (other than his xkcd submits) and chaostheory's submits, but not as much edw519.  A mere difference in taste.  However, my own news snobbery shouldn't affect what goes on the front page.  Everyone then has their own 'view' of the top news.  That way, if Hacker News sucks ass for you, it's because you voted for ""haha news"" and followed submitters' articles that you don't actually find interesting.<p>One of the arguments against this is that the articles would homogenize, because people would follow the same types of things.  Though potentially computationally expensive, one might be able to characterize a user based on the articles submitted/voted in some parameter space, and then you can show a distance measure between this user vs you and all the people you follow.",1206370474

144580,comment,144127,144127,0,0,joshwa,,,"IDEA: A Karma ""bank"" for email.<p>I set up an account at emailkarma.com (sadly, taken, by Xobni, no less!) as a recipient. I set a default free karma amount (say, 100) for new senders, a default karma amount for unsigned emails (say, 50), and route all my email through the service. I also set up a whitelist of known good senders with an infinite karma balance.<p>People who email me for the first time will automatically be issued 100 karma points by the system. They have one of two options:<p>1. People who don't know about the karma system can email me directly, but their emails will ""spend"" the default amount for unsigned emails. When their balance reaches zero, their emails get de-emphasized.<p>2. People who know about the karma system can choose to spend their remaining balance with me by tagging the email subject with [karma: pointvalue]. Unimportant emails can be assigned less value, and if they absolutely need to email me, then they can spend more of their karma.<p>Incoming emails are sorted by date and by karma spend. I can reward relevance by giving them more points to spend, and/or by setting their default karma spend to a higher value. I can punish stupidity by adjusting karma accordingly. Webmail interface, or a thunderbird plugin, maybe?<p>Senders can view their karma balance for a given recipient and default spend (both uneditable) by emailing the service to prove identity and signing up.<p>Arrington, for instance, can reward good tipsters with more karma, and punish PR trolls by slapping them with a karma penalty.<p>You could apply this to other forms of communication, too-- your facebook/friendfeed, twitter, etc., though those would have to be passive (relevance weighted by karma balance, no discrete spend available per post/recipient).",1206369929

144561,comment,144389,144389,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I did that for about 9 months before going full-time 6 months ago.  I'd usually work on the startup for an hour before work and then 1-2 hours after dinner, so maybe 15-20 hours/week.<p>I've found that my coding time hasn't really increased much since going full-time, and yet I'm vastly more productive.  The limiting factor in startups does not seem to be time: it's attention.  Having that extra 8 hrs/day to think about the problem - and more importantly, <i>not</i> having to shift gears and think about my employer's problems - makes all the difference in the world.<p>I've found it also changes the incentives around development and leads to better development practices.  For example, I was much less likely to use frameworks or large libraries when doing this part-time, because I didn't have a solid block of time to thoroughly learn the library.  If there was a major problem in the design, I'd be inclined to hack around it rather than tackle it head-on, because I didn't have the necessary brain-cycles to hold the whole problem in my head.  I'd often cut the design down to what I knew how to do, rather than the product I'd want to use, because that was all I could handle in blocks of an hour.<p>I don't think it's really speed that suffers when you work part-time.  Rather, it sets a ceiling on the difficulty level of the project you can do.  So you're fighting over the same problems as all the other folks who're doing startups part-time, while many of the harder problem lie unsolved.",1206368344

It's the name of the game hop from one useful skill to the next or become obsolete.<p>I don't really care about these lost jobs but saying it's their fault that they become redundant is missing the point.  Luck is a large factor in both the generation and retention of wealth.  The risk of true poverty limits society’s just as excessive crime by reducing people’s willingness to take risks.  Young people are more likely to do a startup because they have lower risk of failure.  Losing everything at 25 is vary different than losing everything at 55.<p>Note: I am not saying we need to do anything with the 3rd world but I feel limited job training and basic welfare help many people bounce back.  Spending a small percentage of GDP on such things is an investment that may or may not pay off but saying it's useless as an ideological stance is missing the point.

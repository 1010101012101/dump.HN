Don't bash the FDA - they're the most evidence based, scientifically minded regulatory body in our government.<p>Preclinical and Phase I - II trials aren't too expensive, in the order of millions of dollars.<p>But also remember, for every ~10,000 candidates that enter preclinical trials, about 1-2 will actually pass FDA approval.<p>The billion number isn't just for one drug, it's also for the 10,000 failures that you had to weed through to find that one drug.<p>Phase I is safety trials in healthy humans (young males generally). Phase II starts using it in the target population (the sick)  and begins looking at dosing requirements and preliminary efficacy data.<p>But the big one, Phase III, that's the big group, expensive, efficacy trial. This is the trial that has to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt scientifically, that the drug does what they say it does. A good Phase III trial can cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars easy. I've heard of $250,000,000 Phase III trials before.<p>If ""the most rigorous evidence requirement in the world"" is your example of ""inefficient and corrupt"", than I guess we'll just disagree.<p>But the FDA is the most strict drug regulatory body in the world, and the amount of evidence for efficacy that they require from the industry is truly impressive and truly does warrant the billions price tag.",1331647111

One of the real issues here is that there are effective treatments for many conditions which do not get to market because they are unpatentable. For instance, St John's wort, which is about as effective as SSRI's is rarely used because it hasn't been through enough trials.<p>Claiming that the cost of clinical trials is the major reason that the drugs need to be priced that high is true, as far as it goes. The issue is that the pharmacuetical companies lobby for more regulation to keep out other treatments not backed by themselves. In addition, they focus on drugs that can cure lifestyle choices (obesity, for example) as rich people can afford them and these will provide a good ROI. Malaria, a disease which is eminently treatable is not focused on as it is a disease which effects poor people.<p>Another major issue is that the companies suppress negative research and studies which show defects in their products. Its an extremely broken system.<p>What I would propose is the following:<p>1) new development of drugs should be carried out by private companies and universities.<p>2) Patents arising from this research should be under a compulsory licensing scheme, based on the outcome of clinical trials.<p>3) Clinical trials should be paid for directly by healthcare systems, to avoid duplication of research and to prevent the suppression of negative research.<p>4) Manufacturing should be completely separate companies who can tool up and down plants. Currently, plants get built in anticipation of approval and then shut down if problems arise, which is extremely wasteful.<p>This would allow the private sector to retain development and manufacturing (but in different companies) and the governments would have much more incentive to conduct good clinical trials, and the results would be public so others could re-analyse the data and find better links with conditions, drugs and outcomes.",1331646539

Why are web pages designed with Photoshop in the first place?<p>Photoshop was never meant to be used for web design, any more than Visio was meant to make wireframes. It's simply the best tool available for the job, and requires a lot of workarounds and good behavior on the part of the designer.<p>Spending days or even weeks designing Photoshop comps that then have to be cut up, converted, and manually translated into suitable graphics for coders to work with is inefficient, and often leads to final products that don't match the designer's work. Text is the most obvious example, but I'm sure anyone can think of myriad places where this happens.<p>Is there a tool that lets designers think about the structure coders will have to build WHILE they're designing the screens? I'm not talking about a WYSIWYG code generatorthose have been tried over and over again, and they all suck. I'm talking about a tool that lets designers design, lets coders code, but helps the designer think about what the coder will have to do with the graphics, including keeping text as text, identifying UI elements that need to be reused, seeing how layouts will look when the browser resizes, etc.<p>If this tool doesn't exist, it sure would be a great project for someone to build.",1331646349

Looking at the docs, 2.0 [appears] to make an attempt via the callAction helper [1], but you still can't inject dependencies via a constructor and call instance methods. Static members in static languages make testing a real pain.<p>Second, JSON felt like a 2nd-class citizen. Dealing with JSON in either the request or the response felt barbaric. I don't see that they've improved things.

Until the late 1800s, American IP law <i>explicitly excluded</i> foreigners from IP rights. That's right, forget about lax enforcement (like you often see in developing nations nowadays) - you could violate foreign IP rights in public view and <i>not a thing would be done about it</i>.<p>And that's exactly what Americans and American companies did - they went to Europe, took the latest IP, brought it back to America, and copied it. Charles Dickens went on a tour of America to try to get people to buy legitimate copies of his books, which no Americans were doing at that point. By the end of his tour, he realized this was a pointless venture, referring to America as a ""nation of pirates"". Doesn't sound that different from what contemporary American industry trade groups call China and India, does it?<p>And it wasn't just international - domestic IP rights violations were endemic as well. The reason the movie industry developed in California was because the movie studios (the <i>same people</i> that are now crying foul about copyright violations) were trying to escape Thomas Edison and his patents on moving picture technology. Not only was Edison's lab in New Jersey, distancing them geographically, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (which covers California) took a more ""relaxed"" view of IP rights.",1331643919

I wrote elsewhere [1]:<p>> A point about the morality of companies angle: the so-called ""fiduciary duty"" of companies that is an overriding duty to maximise shareholder returns within the constraints of the law above all other ends is a legal obligation in only a few countries. In most countries, including most states in the US, executives have a legal responsibility to be honest and open about their performance and honest (if not very open) about their strategy, but have no legal obligation to prefer a more profitable course of action over another, which is obviously right since there is usually no knowable fact of the matter about whether one business plan will turn out to be more profitable than another.<p>> In short, the idea that companies have a moral obligation to act immorally if it pays is mostly or always a myth.<p>There is no chance that Yahoo executives would go to jail if they decided not to pursue a cursed-earth patent troll strategy.  Fiduciary duty is about executives not putting their personal interests before that of the shareholders.<p>It is not even obviously in the company's interest, what they are doing.  If cash-rich FB refuses to settle, all 10 patents get invalidated, and Yahoo has to pay heavy legal fees, then Yahoo is left with a smaller warchest of patents, and one whose firepower has been seen to be lacking.

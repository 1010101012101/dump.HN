Hickey answers the question: if we take this list-processing/decimating function like &quot;count-if&quot; or &quot;map&quot; or whatever, and express it with reduce, what is that reducer function which we will need? And how is that reducer derived from or related to the function that goes into the list processing function, like the mapping function in map?  He then makes those functions behave as methods (when called with one less argument) which give you that reducer.<p>Now what if this is done to reduce itself? What should a reduced arity (reduce fun) return? I think that is a noop: nothing needs to be done to fun to make it reduce under reduce, so (reduce fun) -> fun. I.e. to transduce the reducer &quot;fun&quot;, an arbitrary function, into a function X such that (reduce X list) will do the job of (reduce fun list), we simply equate X with fun.",1409449735

8248172,comment,8245581,8247309,8,0,userbinator,,,"A possible interesting side-effect of really learning Asm is that you start discovering just how <i>horrible</i> compilers/high-level languages actually are at exploiting the full capabilities of the machine, despite &quot;common wisdom&quot; suggesting the opposite. I started with Asm, and when I eventually decided to learn C, I remember the first time I looked at the compiler output of a program I&#x27;d written, compiled with full optimisation, I was astounded. Unnecessary moves and other instructions, very poor register utilisation, and blindness to status flags were just some of the things that compiled programs regularly contained.<p>This was many years ago, but I still see the same today. I do RE so I&#x27;ve read a lot of compiler output, and I&#x27;ve seen some isolated instances where a compiler did something &quot;clever&quot; (Intel&#x27;s is not bad at this), but it tends to be rare and it&#x27;s easy to see the rest of the code still has that &quot;compiler-generated&quot; feel to it.<p>I said &quot;really learning&quot; above, because I think there&#x27;s two ways that people are learning Asm: the first, which is probably more common, is that they only learn the ways in which compilers generate instructions. Those who learn the first way would likely not do any better job than a compiler if asked to write a program, and not see the inefficiency of compiler-generated code, so they wouldn&#x27;t find any particular advantages to using Asm.<p>On the other hand, I believe that if you learn Asm by starting with the machine itself, independent of any HLL, then you don&#x27;t get any preconceived notions of what it can and cannot do, which leads to what I&#x27;d call &quot;real Asm programming.&quot; Then you can see the inefficiencies in compiler-generated code and what HLL abstractions introduce, and can easily beat the compiler in size or speed (often both). Good hand-written Asm has a very different look to it than compiler output.<p><i>This is especially true if you manage to find a novel solution that just wouldn&#x27;t exist when the hardware capabilities are abstracted away by a high level language.</i><p>For some entertaining examples of what Asm can do that compilers cannot, look at the sub-1k categories in the demoscene:<p><a href=""http://www.pouet.net/prodlist.php?type%5B%5D=32b&type%5B%5D=64b&type%5B%5D=128b&type%5B%5D=256b&type%5B%5D=512b&page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pouet.net/prodlist.php?type%5B%5D=32b&type%5B%5D=...</a>\nOne of my favourites: <a href=""http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=3397"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=3397</a>",1409449434

The weakness of the FCC data is mitigated by the fact that you can look at Ookla data to see that the region in question is getting advertised speeds, at least in aggregate.<p>> Why would we expect the U.S. to be competitive on that front?<p>The issue is whether the US has better broadband. Price is central to that question, regardless of what we should expect about it.<p>> The premise of your question is flawed. The urban centers are not the hub of life and wealth in the U.S. like they are in European countries. The word &quot;urban&quot; is a pejorative here.<p>It is in New York. But what is your point here? That the reason broadband is worse in US urban centers is because there isn&#x27;t as much income in urban centers compared to those abroad? Or that broadband is going to be worse because the US population prefers suburban areas?<p>> It&#x27;s really not useful to judge national telecom policy by comparing U.S. cities to a few European cities that have invested heavily in telecom infrastructure as a way to differentiate themselves.<p>Again, the question was whether broadband was better or worse in the US. (And Poland was merely an example I remembered. Romania is another. There are many more).<p>> Almost all of the wealth of the area lives in the suburbs outside the city, which are served very well by fiber service.<p>Except they pay drastically more than international counterparts.<p>I am a bit confused by your position, can you summarize it as concisely as possible?

None of them want an American that looks weak, but there is nothing approaching a consensus about what action we should take instead - for every proponent of bombing ISIS or funnelling arms to Ukraine, there&#x27;s someone else questioning what exact interests we have there.<p>This isn&#x27;t so surprising; Europe&#x27;s internal politics are badly fragmented (IMHO due to a failure to pursue full federalization over the last couple of decades following the introduction of the Euro) and Middle Eastern politics are in a weird flux that I don&#x27;t know how to read at all.

It will be a long time before it&#x27;s cost effective to run fiber to every farm and and shack in the woods in America.

Which is really quite unfortunate because the justification doesn&#x27;t require the remedy. Most of the urban poor neighborhoods might not be profitable but they&#x27;re at least close to break even.

8248129,comment,8247525,8247525,3,0,graycat,,,"Here&#x27;s how I relax, avoid both frequentism and bayesianism, and just love probability:<p>I assume that there is a non-empty set, commonly called Omega, which I regard as the set of all experimental &#x27;trials&#x27; that I might observe.  But, actually, in all the history of everything in the universe, we see only one trial, only one element of this set Omega.<p>Next, there is a non-empty collection, usually denoted by script F, of subsets of Omega.  I assume that set script F is contains Omega as an element and is closed under relative complements and countable unions.  By <i>relative complements,</i> suppose A is an element of script F.  Then the <i>relative complement</i> of set A, maybe written A^c, is essentially set Omega - A, that is, the set of all trials in Omega and not in A.  Then set script F is a sigma-algebra.  Each set A in script F is an <i>event</i>.  If our trial is in set A, then we say that event A has <i>occurred.</i><p>Next there is a function P: script F --> [0, 1].  P assigns 0 to the empty set (event) and is countably additive.  Then function P is a <i>probability measure</i>.  So for each event A in script F, P(A) is a number in [0, 1] and is the <i>probability</i> of event A.<p>Now can define what is means for two events to be <i>independent</i> and can generalize to two sigma algebras being independent.<p>Next, on the set R of real numbers, I consider the <i>usual topology</i>, that is, the collection T of open subsets of R.  Then I let set B, the <i>Borel sets,</i> be the smallest sigma algebra such that T is a subset of B.<p>Next I consider a function X: Omega --> R such that for each Borel set A, X^{-1}(A) is an element of script F.  Then X is a <i>random variable</i>.<p>Essentially anything that can have a numerical value we\ncan regard as a random variable.<p>Then we can state and prove the classic limit theorems -- central limit theorem, weak and strong laws of large numbers, martingale convergence theorem, law of the iterated logarithm, etc.<p>Now we are ready to do applied probability and statistics.  And we have never mentioned either frequentism or Bayesianism.<p>For more details, in an elegant presentation, see J.

I think that shows that the overall structure of our telecom market is not inferior to that in the U.K. or Germany or France.<p>Re: 2, the question is why certain European cities have much faster internet than comparably dense U.S. cities. And I think the answer to that is the same as the answer to: why do certain European cities have much better public transit than comparably dense U.S. cities?<p>The status of Stockholm within the political structure of Sweden, or the status of Warsaw within the political structure of Poland is very different than the status of New York or Chicago within the political structure of the U.S. Large U.S. cities don&#x27;t have the political pull to get national-level infrastructure investment.<p>I&#x27;ve never been to Sweden, but I&#x27;m familiar with Bangladesh, where Dhaka (10% of the national population), is the center of political life.

I&#x27;m not implying anything, just asking to provoke thinking.<p>Can people change? Can large companies change their character? Is Microsoft changing or we are seeing some schizophrenic good actions lately? Food for thought :)",1409446807

That latter option actually saved me one time, but that&#x27;s because I was astronomically lazy in that class and didn&#x27;t do anything (didn&#x27;t even show up to some quizzes, I think, when two quizzes added up to an exam). I definitely think that giving students the option is good, though, because if you asked me which I&#x27;d want I will always choose the small incremental tests over one huge test.",1439391573

I think liberals are people who have a very inclusive ingroup, potentially including everybody on Earth; while conservatives have a smaller or better defined ingroup (e.g. Americans).<p>From this follows that there is only one type of liberals, but many types of conservatives (depending on their ingroup). So the view of liberals and conservatives to the others is different, because conservatives tend to perceive liberals as just another group that has them as outgroup, which is confusing to liberals.<p>I think in fact it&#x27;s similar with religion. Atheism is often understood by religious people as another form of religion, but it isn&#x27;t in fact, it has a unique position among all the types of religious belief; like liberalism is just an edge case of all possible conservativisms.",1439391375

The best way to prevent this decay is by reviewing and testing yourself on the material you want to remember.  Unless one reviews or uses specific knowledge regularly, corresponding memories will fade on courses taken, books read, bugs fixed, technologies or languages learned, code that&#x27;s been understood (read) or written, etc.<p>If you only spent a few weeks working on that new project, then you probably didn&#x27;t spend near the amount of time Bill Gates spent writing, thinking about, and reviewing his Altair BASIC code. Even though he whipped up his code in less than a month or two prior to the first MITS demo, he likely spent weeks or months after that demo modifying and polishing the BASIC interpreter for subsequent releases.  You didn&#x27;t mention your experience level, but Gates&#x27; years of prior programming experience likely benefited him as well, providing him with a nice cognitive framework to which lots of these facts could &quot;stick.&quot;<p>One additional thing:  when Gates says he still knows the source code for Altair BASIC by heart, it probably doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;completely, line-by-line&quot; by heart.  I&#x27;m guessing it means he still remembers some snippets by heart, or that he believes he could re-write it from scratch from memory (which would still be exceedingly impressive).<p>Some useful resources on memory and learning:<p>Memory and Learning: Myths and Facts (<a href=""http://www.supermemo.com/articles/myths.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supermemo.com/articles/myths.htm</a>)<p>Want to Remember Everything You&#x27;ll Ever Learn?

When strong property rights exist (and it is feasible for all parties to negotiate), then parties may reach an efficient allocation of resources regardless of how the resources were initially allocated.<p>To use a typical example, imagine a train track runs through a farmer&#x27;s land and sparks from the train sets the farmer&#x27;s wheat on fire, causing monetary harm. If the train company owns the tracks, then the farmer should be willing to pay to put spark guards along the tracks to protect his crop. Alternatively, if the farmer owns the tracks, the train company should be willing to pay for the damage to the crop to ensure that it can continue to operate.<p>In practice, there may be costs associated with negotiations (e.g. lawyers), it may be infeasible to negotiate between all parties (e.g. if there are many farmers affected), or property rights are not sufficiently strong for one party to bar another from producing negative externalities, all of which can lead to failures of the theorem.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem</a>",1439389442

I&#x27;d be more confident in homeschoolers meeting people with different &quot;biases, backgrounds, and abilities&quot; than in traditional school.<p>It&#x27;s worth remembering that schools are an incredibly artificial construct that are barely a hundred years old, and school as we know it is younger than that. It&#x27;s cognitively tempting, but wrong to treat schooling as the obviously-correct &quot;default answer&quot; against which everything else must strive to be measured... in reality, it&#x27;s a fairly new idea with <i>at best</i> a mixed track record, and if viewed with historically-informed perspective, one with a lot of serious problems, not least of which is the observed fact of systematic squashing of intellectual curiousity.<p>And remember, when observed fact and theory clash, observed fact wins. It doesn&#x27;t matter that <i>theoretically</i> school shouldn&#x27;t do that. It does.<p>(In fact, to the list of school&#x27;s crimes personally I&#x27;d add that it has created an entire society trained to trust academic theories over observed fact. But that&#x27;s another discussion.)<p>Further, there are plenty of people who come out of school exceedingly poorly &quot;socialized&quot;, which can also often be traced back to the artificial social conditions of school itself, combined with the cohort system&#x27;s effect of requiring each new class of kindergarteners being required to construct a new social system from scratch, which is, of course, inevitably a very childish and immature one compared to one in which younger children are folded into a richer social structure formed by children of many ages. I reject the idea that schooling as we know it produces &quot;perfectly socialized&quot; children. It produces <i>school</i>-socialized children, which isn&#x27;t the same thing. It&#x27;s a great deal of the reason why we seem to be infantalized at an older and older age and this failed &quot;socialization&quot; is one of the major reasons I believe the current school system needs to be fully replaced... the &quot;socialization&quot; the current system produces is not a triumph but one of its major glaring flaws.",1439389401

Random forests, as the name implies, involves randomly setting the decision tree parameters numerous times. You can run the same algorithm with the same implementation and get different results.

For most crimes the motive is a huge factor in the severity of the punishment, the intellectual property utilisation industry desperately tries to prevent that kind of nuance from being applied to IP violations.<p>Even if you buy into the &quot;file sharing is theft&quot; mantra, the lack of proportion should be obvious: you don&#x27;t punish casual shoplifters the same as career criminals who turn a profit on stolen goods.<p>Justice should be blind, no doubt, but context and motives matter. Cutting a decade out of someone&#x27;s life for privately hoarding data[0] is absurd.<p>That said, punishments are only reasonable if they are in proportion to the damage (financial, but also social or mental) caused by the crime. The reason most ordinary people consider piracy a trivial offense is that the damages claimed by the industry have barely any basis in reality -- although what damages would be realistic is difficult to say because any research into the non-adverse effects of file sharing tends to be shot down.<p>I agree that piracy should be illegal. I just disagree on what should be considered piracy and to what extent it should be punished. Jaywalking and fare-dodging are illegal, too, but there are very few occasions in which they could result in punishments that would ruin someone financially (or socially in the case of jail terms).<p>[0]: An addendum: I prefer to distinguish between &quot;normal&quot; piracy (e.g. downloading the new Hollywood blockbuster) and hoarding (e.g. downloading every Hollywood blockbuster of the past decade including films you&#x27;re not even interested in watching just for sake of completion). Hoarding isn&#x27;t new (although the Internet makes it a lot easier compared to cassette and VHS recorders or stacks of CD-Rs) and I think it&#x27;s better to consider it as a mental health issue rather than simply a &quot;more extreme&quot; (and thus more criminal) form of piracy. My personal experience is that most hoarders in fact also spend more money on legal media (e.g. cinema tickets, blu-rays or music albums) -- which is of course considered less of a problem because it&#x27;s legal, although it&#x27;s as much of a symptom as their piracy.",1439388587

It is so profitable it has given rise to factories that pump out cheap junk &quot;content&quot;, overwhelming anything of merit on the web[1][2]. Then, to extract even more from the devil in this Faustian bargain, we invade our very customer&#x27;s privacy, selling our soul twice over.<p>Most of us avert our eyes from this moral abdication because it funds our high salaries and our get-rich-quick startup schemes[3].

8026945,comment,8026415,8026813,3,0,klodolph,,,"No, this is wrong.<p>In order to work with infinitesimals in any reasonable way, you have to define how they work.  There <i>is</i> a reasonable way to extend the real numbers in a larger field containing infinitesimals.  Such a field is non-Archimedean and has very surprising properties: for example, you can construct a geometry in which Euclid&#x27;s fifth postulate is false, and yet the angles on a triangle still always add up to 180.  These fields also allow you to formalize your intuition about the way infinitesimals like &quot;dx&quot; and &quot;dy&quot; in calculus and analysis work: you can take an equation and multiply both sides by dx, for example.  This is ordinarily meaningless, since the term dy/dx is ordinarily just notation that does not actually signify a fraction.  In non-standard analysis, it IS a fraction.  I think it&#x27;s a shame that analysis classes in college don&#x27;t use non-Archimedean fields because the proofs are so much simpler.<p>However, even in these fields which admit infinitesimals, there is no definition for x/0.  You can prove it for yourself.<p>Suppose x = 10/0.<p><pre><code>    0*x = 10\n    (0+0)*x = 10\n    0*x + 0*x = 10\n    10 + 10 = 10\n    20 = 10\n</code></pre>\nSo this is just an all-around bad idea, because it permits us to say that 10 = 20.  And all we had to say that 10/0 had a value... we didn&#x27;t even say what that value was.<p>P.S. Although infinitesimals exist, non-standard analysis still does not permit you to, say, plug ∞ into an equation, because there are many different infinite numbers.  However, other systems (projective geometry) admit ∞ as a value.",1405239820

The association has successfully aided the defense of subsequent coffee burn cases.[30] Similarly, as of 2004, Starbucks sells coffee at 175–185 °F (79–85 °C), and the executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America reported that the standard serving temperature is 160–185 °F (71–85 °C).

8026930,comment,8024067,8024067,9,0,pmeunier,,,"Thanks for your interest in our project, that hasn&#x27;t released any version 0.1 in three years, and yet manages to concentrate a lot of (maybe necessary) love and hate.<p>First, about the technical points:<p>- Ocaml has been backward compatible for the last 20 years, which is why we rely on it for backward/forward compatibility. After some time, we obviously hope to release a forward compatible version of Patoline. As a side note, I&#x27;ve got several papers written in LaTeX on my hard drive, that don&#x27;t compile anymore after only eight years.<p>I imagine that debugging and improving packages written in TeX is hard enough that authors who manage to do it do not bother about compatibility. With the exception, of course of those &quot;who know TeX and LaTeX pretty well&quot; (at least until the day they write their first package, like I did shortly before beginning Patoline).<p>Moreover, there is something called &quot;a type system&quot; that OCaml uses, that makes your code more likely that any other non-functional language to remain stable through time. I know there are people who do not acknowledge the existence of this, and confuse it with older systems such as type checking in C, or who believe functional programming is a parenthesis writing competition.\nI would like not to use the kind of authority arguments I&#x27;ve seen in this page to convince you. Trying ocaml or haskell is a good way, but you need to be willing to be convinced, which is usually not the case in this kind of discussions.\nAt least it makes sure that the program cannot run into an &quot;undefined behavior&quot; without the author being aware of it, something that my own daily experience with programs such as svg2tex does not do.<p>- In our first project meeting about Patoline, it was decided to <i>not</i> choose a definitive language. This is probably the only design choice. Of course there is a default one (intended to be forward compatible, if you are still following), but you can change it. Like markdown? Write a compiler to Ocaml, it should not take more than a couple of hours, and you won&#x27;t have to rewrite 20000 lines of code to handle the crappy font formats that Microsoft, Apple and Adobe have designed for you, nor 3000 to output reasonably portable PDF documents that most printers can print (maybe this is an explanation of the size).<p>- Knowing quads, struts, \\expandafter and \\futurelet is cool knowledge. Did you also known that TeX uses its own fixed-point algebra? While these are certainly &quot;inventions of a genius&quot;, using 21st century numerical methods to adjust spaces is efficient use of science and technology, and that&#x27;s what we do.\nBy the way, have you heard of IEEE-754? It doesn&#x27;t begin with a slash, I&#x27;ve seen it used at Caltech, probably Stanford knows about it too.<p>Now about other points:<p>- What is &quot;feature-completeness&quot;? I know &quot;Turing-completeness&quot;, which is the ability to simulate any Turing machine. On the operating systems we have today, &quot;Turing^OS-completeness&quot; (the ability to simulate any Turing machine with the OS as an oracle) is probably a great feature too. This is something Patoline has, that TeX doesn&#x27;t. Querying online bibliographic databases in Patoline is a matter of writing a few lines of OCaml. In TeX, it means writing pascal code, for a variant of pascal that can talk to the OS (web2c probably can, I&#x27;m sure, although it was not written by a genius).<p>- We also seek to provide a development platform for new typesetting algorithm. While Knuth may be regarded as &quot;the man who invented dynamic programming&quot;, he was ten years old when Bellman discovered it.\nToday, we have other methods, such as approximation algorithms. We could even imagine learning good typographic choice using methods from machine learning.\nThere is space for innovation on this planet, and although I use emacs and vim, and even pdflatex on a daily basis, I do not consider them a full stop to software.",1405239284

8026922,comment,8026117,8026555,6,0,waps,,,"I come from &quot;the low lands&quot; in Europe, and trust me when I say this : it took two major disasters to make people redesign the water infrastructure. This occurred in the Netherlands in 1954, and was what created &quot;Rijkswaterstaat&quot; [2] (this is a Dutch ministry, and they&#x27;re serious assholes to be frank, but without them ...), and the development of the &quot;Delta works&quot; [3].<p>Incidentally, apparently they won&#x27;t even be maintained without a major disaster. It&#x27;s now 2014 and a project to raise the Delta works was scrapped for the funds, which will go to some bank related measure instead (the dykes that form the Delta works are sinking into the ground due to their weight and should be raised to avoid the risk of water spilling over them : if the conditions of 1954 repeat, currently a disaster of about 1/3 the proportion of the 1954 floods would occur. It gets worse every year, and apparently by 2065 the Delta works will no longer provide any defense at all, meaning yearly flooding disasters will start occurring at that point).<p>Just providing a data point. Sea level rise is not a significant factor for the delta works (rather the standard deviation in average sea level is. In and around the channel there is an average sea level, and you see sea levels up to 6 meters higher than the average in most locations once per decade. A few centimeters don&#x27;t really change the calculation. Hell, even a meter wouldn&#x27;t significantly alter the situation. But the dykes are just barely 5.5 meters high anymore, and will fail entirely if water starts spilling over. Meaning once the water level goes more than 10 centimers or so above the top of the dykes, they will most likely fall over. Average sea level rise creates a problem for ground water, but that won&#x27;t really affect anyone for quite some time. Btw: go to the page of the delta works linked below. Look at those towers. Just think of how much tonnes of water these guys are keeping out, yet those towers, impressive as they are, will fall over (more likely torn to shreds, but ...) in the next decade or two if nothing is done)<p>In general, I&#x27;d look at the Delta works though as an example of how everything can be fixed, but it comes down to this simple fact, and environmentalists won&#x27;t like it. Humans need to take direct control of the ground water table, by erecting concrete barriers that make it look like the sea level drops several meters from the perspective of inland water tables. Those barriers can also prevent flooding by providing a large coastal basin of water where levels are maintained much lower than sea level (by opening the dykes at ebb and closing them at flood times), where storm floods can drain into. This will destroy fauna that depends on being exposed to waves (I&#x27;m sure they can be maintained in a few locations, like &quot;Het Zwin&quot; [1], but they&#x27;ll no longer dominate the coastline), and will be replaced by inland river-fauna (frankly, I like that much better, but again, environmentalists will object to what amounts to artificial habitats).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwin</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijkswaterstaat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijkswaterstaat</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Works"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Works</a>",1405238800

The only thing you need to resolve is how to handle proprietary source code.<p>Oh and also what if everyone doesn&#x27;t want to code in ocaml?<p>I think we need something similar but built on a type of ontology or description logics or something that represents the program in a common way that is not tied to a particular language representation or model. So I would start with research that does automated program generation in Ocaml and create a semantic model of those concepts.<p>You want to convert the functions from mirageos into this common knowledge representation in a way that integrates with the program generation ontology.<p>You then want to create a projectional editing system which allows for different representations including but not limited to ocaml.",1405238719

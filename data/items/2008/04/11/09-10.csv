160896,comment,160704,160704,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I'm very much in favor of banning Valleywag.<p>They picked up a comment that I made on HN about a friend of mine at Yahoo.  They picked up my one comment, and turned it into two articles about Yahoo's attitude towards the Microsoft merger.  They also posted information that personally identified my friend as the source of the information.<p>Granted, it was my mistake to begin with in posting that here, but I tried to make it right.  PG edited the offending comment for me, and I wrote Valleywag asking them to remove the identifying information for fear that my friend might loose his job in the upcoming layoffs.<p>Not only did they not remove the identifiying information, but they were really nasty to me about the entire affair and I though needlessly hurtful.<p>My friend did get laid off.  I don't know if it had anything to do with the article or not, however.  I don't think it did, and either way, he's doing rather well for himself consulting.<p>So, while I do have some issues about quality of the content over at Valleywag;  I have bigger issues about the editorial process there.  If they can take a random post from an online forum and turn it into two articles about Yahoo's attitude towards Microsoft in the takeover process, all of their content is suspect in my opinion.<p>My opinion is that the majority of their content has a gossip rag/tabloid feel to it, and I would love to see that removed from the Hacker News listing.  I see no reason to reward their trollishness with traffic from Hacker News, even if 15-20 people vote up a post linking to them.",1207907244

It's not like they're bad ideas (asterisk), but they'd be a little bit less tinged with the negative association if they were to pop up independently, and not seemingly as a reaction to a failed attempt at YC.<p>(asterisk) I am not in a position to try for YC myself, and live somewhere where I basically have zero contact with hackers/startup people, so I'm actually pretty enthusiastic about utilizing the internet in order to participate in that ""scene"".",1207906903

Personally I'm not much for using Ubuntu on the desktop, because the standard installation contains way too much bloat. Like a `bluetoothd` running standard.

160891,comment,160133,160220,0,0,yariv,,,"Strictly speaking, Erlang processes have a type of shared memory -- ets tables -- but the semantics are somewhat different from other languages that use traditional shared memory. However, when you need synchronization, you just use Mnesia transactions, which make working with this kind of shared memory a piece of cake. Also, Mnesia is distributed, a nice attribute that other STM implementations lack.",1207906422

Anyone can say ""I'll write a book,"" but very few people can tell you the plot in any great detail, let alone the motifs or themes they'd try to work in.

160883,comment,160732,160819,0,0,Tichy,,,"Why do you think it still has a long way to go? It works fine for me (also Ubuntu) - more than fine actually. So fine that I don't want to use anything else atm.<p>Sure, there were some rough spots in the beginning (solve them once and you are done), but every operating system has them. Overall Ubuntu seems more usable than the alternatives to me (unless you can wrap your mind around the Apple way of thinking maybe - I can't).<p>Everybody is laughing, but I'll say it again: the single coolest move Microsoft could make would be to switch over to Linux. They could provide a fancy theme (they are actually reasonably good with user interfaces, having a research lab and all), port their applications to Linux, and everybody would be happy. I don't think Windows itself is the big moneymaker, anyway. Rather, I suspect they tend to pay people for using it, so they could save money by moving away from it.",1207905135

I am male but I don't care about beer or football, and I would never spread porn in the workplace. If I got lucky with hot babes frequently, maybe I would brag about it - but I wonder, what exactly would you be interested in talking about with men?

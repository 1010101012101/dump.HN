Do you really think that you've come up with an idea that one of the thousands of minds at Google hasn't already thought of and dismissed (or back burnered)?<p>This is a great opportunity.  The likeliest responses by Google when evaluating applicants are (in order):<p>1) That's a really stupid idea.
2) That's not a terrible idea.
3) That's a pretty interesting idea.  We should keep an eye on these guys.
4) That's a really interesting idea.  We should talk to these guys and maybe hire/buy them.
5) That's a REALLY interesting idea, but a lousy implementation.  We should clobber these guys.
6) That's a fabulous idea, and they seem to be doing it right.  Let's buy 'em.<p>Check out the app here: <a href=""http://techcrunch20.com/wp-content/Submission_Form_TC20.doc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch20.com/wp-content/Submission_Form_TC20.doc</a><p>(Word doc?!)<p>They ask for no information you shouldn't be happy to discuss with just about anyone IMHO.

This is one reason why lisp is a compelling choice. You can create your own sub-languages to solve any particular problem. <p>But for lots of reasons lisp may not be suitable. There are lots of other languages to choose so pick the ones that suit solving different problems. There is not one <i>""universal programming hammer""</i> (though lisp is pretty close)  but an array to choose from that may suit different types of problems. <p>esr in his faqto (faq + howto) recommends python, c/cpp, java, perl and lisp. Each language chosen for their abilities to solve different types of problems ~ <a href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#skills1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#skills1</a><p>Tall order?

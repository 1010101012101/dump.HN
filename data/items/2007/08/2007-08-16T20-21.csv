But that's much better than the alternative, which is people banding together to bury certain stories that reach the front page (or before they do, if the karma threshold is above 2).",1187296232

43193,comment,43118,43118,0,0,portLAN,,,"Repeatedly on Reddit, e.g. <a href=""http://science.reddit.com/info/1rssu/comments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science.reddit.com/info/1rssu/comments</a><p>Agriculture simply multiplied everything.  Hunter-gatherers still had and have tribal wars, murder, rape, rapine, torture, high infant mortality, much lower male life expectancy (due to fighting), plus the usual disease, famine, and social inequality of women.<p>The average college student in a dorm room enjoys greater luxury and comfort than kings of yesteryear; they have climate control, hot and cold running water, antibiotics, corrective eyewear, and of course a far greater selection of food year-round, not to mention a better selection of healthy mates.<p>Whether people are happier in modern technological society or hunter-gatherer society is almost beside the point; evolution seems to have selected for worried, discontented people -- they outcompete the easily satiated.  Even as we precipitate the extinction of traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyles, we can imagine them at some point in the past wiping out even less technologically-savvy people who perhaps were even more happy and contented, leading an existence akin to our bonobo relatives.  A similar article written then by gatherers might blame the widespread adoption of hunting for increasing societal violence and leading to a new class division: warrior, due to the ensuing upswing in human-human ""hunting"".<p>Increased population can be thought of as a tool; it has been exploited for ill much of the time, but it can also be used for the betterment of all.  When we start to live in ""The Matrix"" (a pleasurable one), we may well rely on aquaculture to produce high-yield algae we farm for biofuel and for nutrients for our IV drips.  At that point we may instead regard agriculture, regardless of temporary blips, as the best thing to happen to humanity.

43191,comment,43150,43179,0,0,Darmani,,,"That is true, but my point was merely countering the assertion that ancient farming cultures had more average free time than ancient hunter-gatherer cultures. I don't dispute that agriculture allowed technology to eventually flourish in the slightest; hundreds of millenia of slow-progress pre-agricultural prehistory are strong evidence of that.",1187295652

I went by the definition of ""is not shown on TV"". It's 20 years old, but old articles have been posted before, and I only found it today... If nobody is interested, nobody will mod it up?<p>Besides, I thought this article also relates to startupping, because of the average work hours aspect.

43183,comment,43118,43151,0,0,Darmani,,,"I think it is moreso the ability to settle in one place that caused the growth of technology. The hunter-gatherers, no matter how numerous, certainly did not spend their free time building forges and experimenting with metal.<p>Also note that the time spent gathering food likely does not include preparing to gather food (e.g.: making weapons). Although they could spend plenty of time playing games, note that games originated to prepare children to spend time gathering food (and practice other necessary survival skills).",1187294591

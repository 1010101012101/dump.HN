2326724,comment,2326545,2326668,0,0,_delirium,,,"The core algorithms are pretty creaky as well. Knuth did a brilliant job coming up with efficient algorithms that could do a fairly good job at breaking lines/paragraphs/pages and could handle book-length documents even on 70s-era hardware, but they've had minimal improvement since then. Figure placement in particular is pretty bad, especially for two-column, relatively short conference papers, which is currently a frequent TeX use case. And all of those things are really hard to exercise any control over, with black-magic parameters that often don't have obvious effects (""goddammit, why won't it put the figure at the top of page 5?!"").<p>LuaTeX does seem to be experimenting with some improvements in these areas though.",1300183188
2326723,comment,2326545,2326545,0,0,akjj,,,"I feel that the OP misunderstands TeX's virtues: it is a very powerful typesetting system whose macro system happens to be Turing complete. Typesetting is the hard problem and TeX has solved it so well that most people wanting to build a text-driven typesetting system has built on top of TeX rather than trying to replicate it. This is especially true for typesetting equations.<p>If you try to use TeX as a programming language, you're going to be disappointed, as the OP seems to have been. The macros work well enough for saving typing by making simple substitutions, which is what most people use them for. But using them for anything more complicated is a bit of a black art. Somewhere I read that Leslie Lamport wrote out LaTeX in pseudo-code first and then translated it into macros. Knuth was impressed by what Lamport was able to do with a system which was not meant to be a general-purpose programming language.<p>In the end, I think Knuth was correct to make TeX's input focused on document entry and not on programming. I've never used it, but LuaTeX seems interesting because I think it's better to use an external language for programming rather than one embedded in a document layout format.",1300183171

And it is also funny how lots of these people try to downplay the effects of the Chernobyl disaster, if that's even possible. When it comes to the number of casualties they hurry up in bringing up the 4,000 mentioned in the IAEA report, which is like asking Dick Cheney or Donald Rumsfeld of writing up about the effects of the Iraq mess.<p>Just today I was reading about how in one of counties of Romania (of which I am a citizen) the number of deaths caused by cancer is double the number of deaths caused by TBC (which used to be the number one killer before 1986) or diabetes. One might argue that this may be caused by a sudden change in the the conditions of living or anything related, but I can assure you that's not the case (if anything, heart-related deaths should have been on the number one spot). Of course, you won't see these cancer-related deaths taken into account in any of IAEA's reports.<p>I also have some sort of personal emotional involvement in all this, as one of my childhood playmates and best-friends died of leukemia in 1990. He was 5 when Chernobyl happened, but of course no-one can link his death to that disaster, can it? It doesn't matter that I can't even remember one case of my parents telling me about kids dying of cancer in the '50s or the '60s, because that just didn't happen (although child mortality was way higher back then). It all miraculously started to happen after Chernobyl.",1300182911

The explosions happen because the steam separates into Hydrogen & Oxygen due to a reaction, and once outside that is an explosive mix.<p>The chamber is pretty large, several meters deep around the core.<p>The explosions are as a result of the release of the hydrogen/oxygen mix - which does not take much to catch - but they occurred outside the pressure vessel. Such a situations is technically planned for, the building structure ""fails outward"" allowing the blast out and away from the pressure containment. It is relatively unlikely to damage the integrity of the vessel in such a situation; they are very very strong pieces of kit (at three mile island the explosion took place <i>inside</i> the vessel and I believe it did not compromise its integrity).<p>At this stage is somewhat unclear but it appears that the <i>third</i> explosion has damaged one of the pressure vessels. However the technical explanations I am seeing are stating that it hasn't compromised the integrity of the containment; instead it appears to be saying that parts of the mechanism inside the containment are damaged (in this case the ""torus"" which is used as an emergency pressure relief system).<p>This is actually, though, a significant problem, if true, because it could affect what happens if it finally does meltdown (as I mention in another comment, my working knowledge of this form of reactor is incomplete, but IIRC the torus also forms part of the final emergency response to a meltdown).<p>Bottom line is; at this stage we know there have been 3 hydrogen explosions at 3 of the units, and one fire at another of the reactors. But it is still unclear the level of damage and risk with each unit - TEPCO (and indeed Japanese companies in general) tend to play down or not discuss details and risk publicly. Take this fire; no one really picked it up <i>until it was out</i> - at which point TEPCO appear to have started mentioning it.<p>If I had to lay a claim I suspect that reactor 2 at this stage will probably meltdown; loss of the torus is significant enough that it raises the risk of what they are currently doing (i.e. trying to cool the core).",1300181713

(Notice that the black and white  notes are arranged so that you skip some keys-- whole steps-- but sometimes you can't: half steps). I always teach how to build scales based on this pattern- WWHWWWH. Using this pattern, you can build any major scale beginning on any arbitrary note-- including notes that are sharped or flatted, which is neat. From here, you can figure out all of the scales, and thus all of the keys.<p>The advantage of learning in this fashion is that you can tackle <i>intervals</i> first, which are the distances between notes. (Note that major and minor intervals are named as such because they fit into our major or minor scales). Since a chord is simply collection of intervals, you end up with a more powerful understanding of them by learning which intervals (and which scale degrees) build which chords.<p>All the same, I really think the more ""practical"" approach here is really interesting, because you can start writing music earlier, albeit mostly in C Major.<p>Cool link, it really gives me insight as a fellow music educator.",1300181131

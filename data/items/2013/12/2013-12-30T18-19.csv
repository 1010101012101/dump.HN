Also, on many systems space is king (the last embedded system I wrote had 6 bytes left over in code space, and 16-bit operations were incredibly expensive and nearly unaffordable).<p>#3: Just make the code clear. This rule is lunacy.<p>#4: Well, maybe. Except that variable initialization can often be made quite compact by the runtime (e.g., an expansion of a compressed data segment into RAM), and so save you code space.<p>#5: Again, the compiler can screw you here. Also, it&#x27;s possible to take the address of a constant and have it be wiped out (for naïve implementations, anyway).<p>My basic rules:<p>#0: Don&#x27;t make assumptions.

Since TSP is not a decision problem, it is not in NP, therefore it cannot be NP-complete. However, it is NP-<i>hard</i>.<p>One can call this a minor nitpick.

However, the really important thing is that we haven&#x27;t found a way to solve NP-hard (and hence of course NP-complete) problems efficiently on a deterministic Turing machine (and hence computers as we can actually build them). An informal way of saying the same thing is &quot;TSP is really really hard to solve&quot;.<p>Either way, I&#x27;m always surprised at how many problems we encounter in our every day lives are actually NP-hard.

All of my final changes are in my working directory, but for cleanliness I want to break them up into several commits by staging them.<p><pre><code>   $ git status\n   <git prints a bunch of &quot;Changes not staged for commit&quot;>\n   $ git add foo.c bar.c\n   $ git status\n   <git prints foo.c and bar.c as &quot;to be committed&quot;, baz.c\n   is still &quot;not staged for commit&quot;>\n   $ git commit\n</code></pre>\nAt this point I have committed my changed foo.c and bar.c, but the commit does not reflect my changes to baz.c.  That means that I have not actually tested that the tree state at this commit works.  If I run my tests right now, they will not reflect whether the commit is broken or not, because my working tree still includes my uncommitted and unstaged changes to baz.c.<p>I do have a couple of options now.  I can stash my changes to baz.c and run the tests; then &quot;stash apply&quot; them if the tests pass.  This is probably the best option for ensuring that my staged commit is not broken.  I can also commit my changes to baz.c, then checkout HEAD^ and run the tests, but this solution forces me to mentally keep track of which commits I have tested; if there are many commits in the series, this is burdensome.<p>Both of these solutions are entirely possible; I&#x27;m not denying this.  The &quot;stash&quot; solution is probably the best option for this.  But that said, it is fundamentally true that when you (partially) stage a commit, you can&#x27;t test your commit prior to committing it.  So when you write your commit message and mentally perform the process of deciding that you like this commit enough for public consumption, you don&#x27;t actually know if your tree is broken or not.  Even though there are workarounds, I still think this is a bit clumsy.",1388428336

Here&#x27;s a short summary of why:<p>To begin the migration, we needed to move from Python 2.6 (which is the default on our CentOS6 production boxes) to Python 2.7. This transition is actually rather hard. We can&#x27;t use the packages provided in CentOS base or EPEL, because they are all complied against Python 2.6. To re-produce all of our package requirements would require us to either build new packages of the compiled libraries (such as MySQL-python, python-crypto, PyYAML, etc), or load down our production environment with a compiler and all of the development libraries.<p>Migrating from Python 2.7 to Python 3 would have required a nearly identical effort (there&#x27;s not a lot of Python 3 packages for CentOS, in particular the packages that we need for our application).<p>Frankly, it&#x27;s just not worth that effort at this time. Python 2.6 is the default environment, there&#x27;s solid package support for it, and it just plain works.

Mars requires a map of the sky and a pair of binoculars, at least.<p>The Moon is important because it motivates the nonscientific people of Earth to support more productive forms of space exploration research.  It reminds people that this is not only a very small world, but the only one we have.  And it creates a seed economy with a shorter possible cycle of iterations than a few missions clustered around the same 3-month launch window every 780 days.  There is some merit to having regular shorter missions to a closer target, so that when that window comes around, you have people with steady jobs and experience around to run the longer missions.<p>It isn&#x27;t just about the scientific benefit.  You also have to consider the human factors.  Nobody wants to train for years to be unemployed 90% of the time, waiting around for the next time someone needs some specific skill.  The thing about Moon missions is that they can be done with resources that would otherwise be mothballed and rusting, or used once and discarded.",1388427006

6985876,comment,6984970,6985283,4,0,theseoafs,,,"> If you need macros to hack C to enable some functionality not inherent to the language, you should change the approach or switch to a different language.<p>I think if you continue to do serious C hacking, you&#x27;ll find a lot of places where macros are legitimately a good choice.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve found that macros are very, very useful when it comes to implementing error handling in a robust way.  In C, the only real way to detect whether a function has failed is to return an error code.  The caller then has to test for the error code and take the appropriate action if there was an error.  I&#x27;m working on a side project now that was doing a LOT of this because it does a lot of IO and memory allocation (and basically any operation you do on a file or any call to `malloc` or a function that calls `malloc` can spontaneously fail in C).  So my source code, after a while, ended up looking more or less like this:<p><pre><code>    if ((f = open_file()) == NULL)\n        return ERROR_CODE;\n    if ((s = allocate_string()) == NULL)\n        return ERROR_CODE;\n    if (write_string_to_file(s, f) < 0)\n        return ERROR_CODE;\n</code></pre>\n... and so on, and so forth.  It got to the point where basically all of the function calls I did needed to be manually checked for an error, which made all of my code really messy and hard to read.  The only real way to refactor these checks in pure C without sacrificing robustness is to use a macro:<p><pre><code>    #define MY_ASSERT(c) do { if (!(c)) return ERROR_CODE; } while (0)\n    MY_ASSERT((f = open_file()) != NULL);\n    MY_ASSERT((s = allocate_string()) != NULL);\n    MY_ASSERT(write_string_to_file(s, f) >= 0);\n</code></pre>\nThis has the same effect as the code above, without sacrificing comprehensibility or readability.<p>> Also macros are usually used to &quot;speed up&quot; the code. You should never optimize before finding the real bottleneck in your code. And thus always use functions instead of macros.<p>I think a lot of people on HN and /r/programming fail to understand why premature optimization is a bad thing.  A lot of programmers hide behind the &quot;premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot; thing to justify their pre-existing biases or their inefficient code.  The point is that you shouldn&#x27;t <i>spend a great deal of time</i> optimizing functions or algorithms unless optimizing those functions or algorithms will be productive.  It&#x27;s wasteful to spend a bunch of time optimizing your IO operations, for example, if 95% of the time is being spent in the database.  The macro-vs-function debate has nothing to do with that.  Writing a macro definition takes no more effort than writing a function definition, so you shouldn&#x27;t be opposed to writing<p><pre><code>    #define SOME_OPERATION(x) (((x) * 100) / 3 + 500)\n</code></pre>\nrather than<p><pre><code>    int some_operation(int x) { return (x * 100) / 3 + 500; } \n</code></pre>\nThat isn&#x27;t premature optimization, you&#x27;re just guaranteeing that the compiler won&#x27;t introduce the overhead of a function call.",1388426941

I&#x27;m already in bioinformatics, but wasn&#x27;t very focused on any subdomain of biology, so there&#x27;s a lot to catch up on. I&#x27;m excited about Calico, but there&#x27;s so little information available that it&#x27;s hard to know if there&#x27;s going to be any way for someone with just an MS in bioinformatics to wedge their way into helping with that effort (though I&#x27;m going to try!).<p>It would just suck to fail at figuring it out (result: death) and it might also suck to succeed (crazy fundamentalist shoots me in the head, result: death) but indefinite procrastination is probably the most assured way to die and be unfulfilled on top that... so it&#x27;s worth having a go. Maybe I should work on cryopreservation instead, and leave the living forever bit to someone else to figure out?<p>Thanks for the mprize link, hadn&#x27;t heard of that.",1388426503

I like the games, but they could use some improvement in concept and overall quality, which shouldn&#x27;t be hard for you if you spend enough time on each and every one. Focusing on one app would allow you to spend enough time, and would help you succeed further in the Windows App Market :)",1388426487

Does a daily hour of walk or having a regular sex life qualify as doing exercise? What about biking to work daily or nearly so?<p>It kinds of remind me of a survey that a friend conducted a few years back in Nantes (France) on alcoholism. To the question, how many liters of alcohol per day do you drink?, alcoholics would reply a certain amount. The next question was: how many liters of beer or wine do you drink in addition? Quite a few added liters. Go figure.",1388426443

The situation with threading in PHP and Python is really the same:  &quot;it almost works&quot; but the PHP community is responsible and says you shouldn&#x27;t really use threads and the Python community is irresponsible and says &quot;come in the water is fine&quot;.<p>The developers of languages such as PHP,  C# and Java value backwards compatibility.  Certainly things break from release to release,  but some effort is made to minimize the  effect,  whereas in Python 3 they rewrote important APIs and broke a lot of stuff that they didn&#x27;t have to break.",1388426439

The first thing I&#x27;ll do is interview them about any problem I&#x27;m investigating, and while they are masters of hindsight, they&#x27;ll not always be masters of foresight. My coworkers and I have spent a lot of time talking about this sort of thing, and we&#x27;re often flabbergasted that they don&#x27;t point out these obvious things sooner. As in, your typical person just gets used to broken things, or they just never think about it. Literally, they&#x27;ll never think &quot;there&#x27;s got to be a better way&quot;. But the operators who do have that foresight, they are just living gold (though not quite as rare).<p>Mind, I&#x27;ve had my share of &quot;why not get a 100 foot tape measure&quot; instead of attempting to use laser measurements, but they&#x27;re in the minority. I emphasize them in practice because people need to feel like they&#x27;re smart enough to see the simple solutions (because they _are_), but often I have to work to merge their solutions into something workable.<p>TL;DR: operators should be consulted first, last, and during the development.

Only after those insights are accepted by the psychiatry community they are worked into the next version of the DSM; DSM V is (as it looks now) going to contain a lot of updates on ADHD in children, and progressive insights on adult-onset ADHD are probably going to be too cutting edge to be included (now this <i>is</i> of course something fairly new and I agree with the methods used to compose the DSM - better to be conservative here; my point is that the DSM is not the most up to date 'standard' to follow).",1288536780

1853310,comment,1852309,1853080,0,0,fnl,,,"But there is a minute, yet important difference: the App Stores are entirely controlled by Apple, whilst Microsoft never restricted or controlled your access to their platform as a software provider. So, maybe they ""dominated"" because of Office et al., but they never pro-actively locked out other providers - a policy common on the iPhone, formerly on the old Mac OS, and now apparently coming ""back to the Mac [App Store]"". The same thing was (and, in parts, even still is) the case with hardware: it was a piece of cake to sell hardware for the Windows platform (worst case you had to write your own device driver), but particularly tricky to do so for Mac. Apple now has the lead because they were first with many neat things on OSX, the iPod, then the iPhone and now maybe the iTablet. So they were first with a clean mobile platform. But Android has caught up and Windows 7 has just downright copied the entire OSX experience and maybe even added a few features of its own. So can Apple stand its grounds with their tight policies? I say, only if they manage to constantly stay ahead of competition, just as now maybe with the tablet PC approach. But how much longer will they be capable of delivering ahead of everybody else? And if they don't stay ahead, will they open up to let independent and innovative developers to maintain the lead or will they not? And in that respect I think current signals are rather discouraging.",1288536042

But unlike regular companies, they are 100-percent owned by their members, not outside investors.  With consumer cooperatives, the members are the people who buy things from the business.  And the cool thing is, when a co-op makes a profit, it goes back to the members, either in the form of refunds or lower prices.<p>My instinct is to emphasize the ownership aspect -- e.g., ""When we profit, you profit.""<p>But is that the best angle to play up?",1288534416

1853252,comment,1852560,1852736,0,0,ajb,,,"Okay, here's a trick. The goal is to detect people who can't discriminate bad stuff from good, can't restrain themselves from replying to a troll (or can't identify when they are doing so).<p>The mechanism is, counter-intuitively, to allow people to rate their own comments. However, this rating is not to be directly used to affect how the comment is displayed, since that would obviously be easy to game. Instead, it would be used to identify people who can't restrain themselves from engaging in a low quality discussion; ie, replying to a troll or similar.<p>Obviously we can't expect trolls to rate their own post as trollish, but we can expect at least some people to have the   self-knowledge required to admit when they are posting while annoyed or similar.<p>So, the system assumes that a comment is only as good quality as its parent, or at least, not much better. Obviously, one can make a good contribution in reply to a bad one, but it's not necessarily a problem to discourage this - since the reader of such a contribution has to read the bad contribution to get to the good one.<p>Internally, each user has their own scale, which their replies - and the replies to their comments - relate to the scales of other users, using the above assumption. A user would then be shown  only comments to which they are likely to reply; this means trolls see all the trolls, but quality users see only other quality comments.<p>There are a couple of potential problems. One is that it would bias people against replying to deeply nested comments; and ultimately, towards making submissions instead of replies. One rather drastic way to deal with this would be to remove the submission mechanism, and only have one conversation tree; the frontpage items would then be the roots of current discussions inferred from the structure of the tree.<p>The second problem is that while this mechanism would help current users filter out trolls, it would do nothing to help new users find the best discussions. There is a conflict between preventing the system being gamed, and allowing new users to find the best discussions; because the former would prefer the ratings to be secret, but the latter would allow information about them to be public. It is not obvious that there is a workable trade-off.",1288533816

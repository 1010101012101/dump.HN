The discussion is about C++, which shares the same heap management as C, so I don't see what you are trying to say here.</i><p>You were the one who brought up C.  But basically, all languages that require manual memory management fall into the category of ""you probably shouldn't use them"".  Memory management is too hard for people to get right.  Computers are much better at that tedious task.  (As an aside, it is interesting that it's easier to write a generic memory manager than to remember to do it right every time yourself.  Programming is an interesting art.)<p><i>Until you have, please don't condescend to tell Guido or Linus or Larry how to write their code.</i><p>Honestly, this is a bad example.  When Python and Perl were started, there was no other option for writing a language that would run on UNIX.  UNIX software was written in either C or shell.  Now that Perl and Python exist, they are much better choices than C for almost any class of problem.  That's why they were written.  If Guido and Larry actually wanted to use C for everything, they wouldn't have needed to write their own languages.<p>BTW, the Perl6 implementation written with Haskell came together in about a weekend, while the C implementation is about as complete after 5-or-so years.  C is a pain.<p>Finally, I find it condescending that you want to throw away the last 40 years of programming language research because UNIX is written in C.  Remember the Lisp machines?  It's a shame that UNIX lost out to them, because it was much easier to write software (and libraries) in Lisp than in C.  Oh well, at least we have emacs.<p>C has its purpose, but its purpose is not for writing programming languages, web servers, or desktop applications.",1222481143

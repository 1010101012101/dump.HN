This requires Facebook&#x27;s cooperation.<p>To get data from European data centers, the NSA can intercept data from direct network taps in the ground, under the sea, at peering points. They can intercept router or server hardware during data center construction and plant backdoors. In short, they can take all sorts of action that might be illegal domestically, but which they can&#x27;t be prosecuted for in the US if done overseas.<p>At best, European police/counter-intelligence could catch them in the act and arrest them as spies. So basically, European data held on domestic US soil has a greater level of bureaucracy get, compared to say, European data held on foreign soil, where all bets are off.<p>Remember the Echelon scares of the 90s? That was the NSA using SIGINT interception of European cellular traffic with zero oversight or regulation.<p>My point is, this seems to be solving a non-problem.

Reddit is a weird place where content grow out of distinct subreddits, and sometimes, that content end up on the front-page (which I bet is the most commonly visited on Reddit). The discussions and &quot;We are the Reddit army&quot; is often a big fat joke (or circlejerk as Reddit calls it). People get eachother riled up, and start to believe that they have &quot;a right&quot; to dictate anything and everything regarding to the site politics. Just watch the whole fat-shaming incident. People were acting like someone was put on death-row, while pretty much all the management of the site did was take down a few horrible sub-reddits that made a laughing stock of people with serious problems. People started arguing that &quot;condoning fat people was wrong&quot; as if that was ever an argument. I think Reddit is beyond management.

It can be used entirely from an object-oriented point of view, or entirely from a functional programming point of view.  This is construed to be a feature of the language.<p>Flexibility is Perl&#x27;s greatest strength and weakness.  Perl forces you into dealing with other people&#x27;s thought processes as a consequence of allowing your own code to be expressive and better reflect your thought processes.  If this is not a tradeoff you&#x27;re willing to make, Perl is most likely not for you.

These people are going to New York or the Bay Area, maybe Chicago or LA at best. They can ignore the US&#x27;s massive inequalities because they&#x27;re reaching for the best of their professions and available quality of life, and they know that if things go sour they can go to their homelands with a pile of cash and live like kings back home, which is a seriously good Plan B.<p>* Truly wealthy people can move around freely throughout the world and can enjoy the best that the US&#x27; global cities offer with none of their drawbacks, so long-term issues are mostly irrelevant unless we&#x27;re talking business, and the laws in the country favor corporations massively.<p>So yeah, a lot of people in academia go to Europe, a lot of the educated middle classes in developing countries nowadays choose to stay put because they enjoy good benefits from a globalized economy and fewer of the drawbacks of their countries.

Its also a problem if the $10 option pre-supposed you buy in bulk, have access to refrigeration, and use spreadsheets to minimize wastage which otherwsie might be as high as 30% (making it $10 for 1400 calories down the gullet). My understanding of what little research has been done in this area has highlighted that the logistics and economics of fresh fruit/veg are heavily biased towards the upper/middle classes in many ways that are not obviously apparent nor addressed stricly by &quot;guidance&quot; on what is a &quot;better&quot; mix of foods. To use an analogy that people with white priveldge may be more able to understand: if I tell you to pack a weeks worth of fresh fruit and raw meat for a hike in yosemite, which you have to carry, and forbid you from eating anything like nuts/granola/raisins/cliffbars/dried meat, you probably would have a bad time lugging around that backpack over 10,000 ft passes and what not. The reality is that rich white people in the backcountry eat the same crappy food as inner city poor people once they lose access to refrigeration/storage and frequent/convenient resupply options. It doesn matter if you look at a pro bar or a nature valley or a power bar or a snickers. They are all interchangeble in that context and do the job, despite some being up to 7x as expensive. And nobody would call a diet of 8 probars and a pack of beef jerkey a day either healthy or well rounded, but you will survive your trip. Of course, if you eat this diet in a sedentary culture, you&#x27;re BMI will get out of wack. But that is the power of the explanation.",1444202259

U.S. law supposedly doesn&#x27;t allow the NSA to conduct domestic intercept on US citizens except through &quot;legal&quot; means. There is no such protection for the NSA monitoring overseas communications.

There wouldn&#x27;t even be a need for a kangaroo FISA court or NSL.<p>To me, this all seems like a total break with the spirit of the internet. I grew up on the internet in the 80s, where we actually imagined it transcending national concerns and local politics. Remember John Perry Barlow&#x27;s Cyberspace Declaration of Independence? (<a href=""https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html</a>)<p>The whole point around federated decentralized networking, was common carriage of data, non-discrimination, and the fact that you could host a server and serve anyone from all around the world without having to worry about hundreds of different legal regimes stepping on your toes.<p>Now it seems we&#x27;ve got the exact opposite of the internet imagined in the 80s and 90s, free of political interference. Instead, if you set up a server on the internet these days, you&#x27;ll have to worry about European &quot;rights to be forgotten&quot; and privacy laws, Chinese or Russia censorship, Thai insults to the King, and on and on.<p>The simplicity of &quot;here&#x27;s my site/app, if you don&#x27;t like it, please don&#x27;t use it&quot;, has been replaced with &quot;please track the geo-ip of your users, make sure you host copies of your server in the EU, Russia, China, and elsewhere, and route traffic appropriately.

After PCMCIA picked up speed, a &quot;non-practicing entity&quot; pulled a patent out of their portfolio for a &quot;programmable connector&quot;. Because the PCMCIA ethernet card itself plugged into the computer and presented a different connector to the outside world, the NPE was able to sue and/or settle with something like 90% of the companies making PCMCIA ethernet cards & modems.<p>3COM had a cool connector on some of their cards called XJACK. It was a little tray you slid out of the card. It had a hole that your RJ-45 plug slid into and some pins. It would certainly make for thinner devices today, but the connectors broke pretty easily and you ended up with an ethernet cable sticking out at a weird angle.<p>Before everybody standardized on RJ-45, there was a standard called AUI which used a 15-pin D connector. Your network card would have an AUI connector and you&#x27;d buy an adapter for whatever kind of network you needed to attach to. Apple had their AAUI which was much, much smaller (about the size of 2 mini Display Ports?). But I think licensing kept that from taking off as a standard.",1444201507

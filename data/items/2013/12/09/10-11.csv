Cows are a certain size, overhead is relatively low, and so twice as much beef costs roughly twice as much.<p>With pharmaceuticals, cost is highly unlinked with volume. Marginal cost is almost nothing, but fixed costs are very high. Its like the restaurant: because most of the cost of the product is overhead and per diner rather than the food cost, half as much food sells for way more than half the price. This is true even though restaurants are in highly competitive markets.",1386586697

This could have been avoided had there been more fake terror plots &#x27;foiled&#x27; by the hard efforts of the snitches. The rationale for the mass surveillance could have been more credible had that happened. As it is nobody really believes they spy on us to catch the terrorists, paedophiles and drug kingpins.<p>Perhaps greed got in the way too. Had the intelligence community contractors outsourced some of their work to the &#x27;normal&#x27; internet companies and not seen them as &#x27;enemy&#x27; then it would have been harder for them to complain about what has been going on. They could have co-opted Microsoft to build their tools, got Google to build their data centres, helped out Yahoo and bought a few more Apple boxes, making Silicon Valley dependent on them for a large chunk of their revenue stream. They would then have towed the line that bit better, portraying themselves as good patriots for helping the government win The War Against Terror. As it is we now have two types of tech mega-corp, those wanting the surveillance state and those that don&#x27;t want it. Had greed not gotten the better of the likes of Lockheed Martin this could have been avoided. This is a sad day for big brother.",1386586526

Daniel Ellsberg is in a better position to comment on this than just about anyone else; here&#x27;s what he said (<a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-07-07/opinions/40427629_1_daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-snowden-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-07-07/opinions/40427...</a> ):<p>&quot;Yet when I surrendered to arrest in Boston, having given out my last copies of the papers the night before, I was released on personal recognizance bond the same day. Later, when my charges were increased from the original three counts to 12, carrying a possible 115-year sentence, my bond was increased to $50,000. But for the whole two years I was under indictment, I was free to speak to the media and at rallies and public lectures. I was, after all, part of a movement against an ongoing war. Helping to end that war was my preeminent concern. I couldn’t have done that abroad, and leaving the country never entered my mind.<p>There is no chance that experience could be reproduced today, let alone that a trial could be terminated by the revelation of White House actions against a defendant that were clearly criminal in Richard Nixon’s era — and figured in his resignation in the face of impeachment — but are today all regarded as legal (including an attempt to &#x27;incapacitate me totally&#x27;).<p>I hope Snowden’s revelations will spark a movement to rescue our democracy, but he could not be part of that movement had he stayed here. There is zero chance that he would be allowed out on bail if he returned now and close to no chance that, had he not left the country, he would have been granted bail. Instead, he would be in a prison cell like Bradley Manning, incommunicado.<p>He would almost certainly be confined in total isolation, even longer than the more than eight months Manning suffered during his three years of imprisonment before his trial began recently. The United Nations Special Rapporteur for Torture described Manning’s conditions as &#x27;cruel, inhuman and degrading.&#x27; (That realistic prospect, by itself, is grounds for most countries granting Snowden asylum, if they could withstand bullying and bribery from the United States.)<p>Snowden believes that he has done nothing wrong. I agree wholeheartedly. More than 40 years after my unauthorized disclosure of the Pentagon Papers, such leaks remain the lifeblood of a free press and our republic. One lesson of the Pentagon Papers and Snowden’s leaks is simple: secrecy corrupts, just as power corrupts.&quot;<p>(ii) when they forced down the Bolivian presidential plane, they forfeited the moral right to criticize Snowden for staying in Russia.",1386586209

The difference between us and East Germany is now mainly a matter of scale. But as Snowden showed, we were scaling up pretty fucking fast.<p>Snowden blew the lid off of it, he exposed the massive scale of it, and then he was literally <i>running for his fucking life</i> like some kind of Jason Bourne figure. He had a massive, ruthless security apparatus chasing him, willing do who knows what, and if they caught him it meant he was going to be <i>tortured in solitary confinement for the rest of his life</i> like Bradley Manning.<p>Nobody in their right mind would begrudge him from going any fucking place he had to in order to escape that.<p>And to my Cold War-shaped mind, it is impossible to think of him as anything other than a whistleblower that this country badly, badly needed.",1386585625

Good freelancers will often have a few offers on the table at the same time and can pick and choose between jobs.<p>One of the ways we have attempted to deal with the problem is by building in the option for available and qualified freelancers to state an interest in a position. Hiring companies are still returned a list of matched candidates, but can further refine it by showing only those interested in the job.<p>We are looking at also building in a simple 1 click update via email (I&#x27;m booked next week, I&#x27;m booked for 2 weeks, I&#x27;m  booked this month) that will allow freelancers to update their availability without having to sign in. Unfortunately people don&#x27;t like emails much either. So this will require careful testing.<p>Agree that curation is important. Nobody is going to pay for access to a list of people of dubious quality. They would rather have 4 good results than 200 bad ones.

Good job for the PR people behind that move! Here&#x27;s why:<p>* It says &quot;Governments&quot; (plural). That means because US security agencies have thoroughly breached the borders of acceptable privacy, now all governments should diminish their control. I&#x27;m aware Eu agencies do the same, but they don&#x27;t build as big datacenters as the NSA does. By not having the same budgets, Eu agencies don&#x27;t overreach as much as the NSA does.<p>* As a European, the best protection I see against all-spying programs is to have competitive European web services. For example I would support a Eu decision to require a European email address for communication with governments, or similar rules designed to make sure Europeans communicate through safe channels with their governments. It is also EU&#x27;s role to make sure we have enough competitors so that citizens can use local providers (competitors to Fb, etc) to store their data in Europe, if those consumers trust European spying agencies. As a desired side effect, it is a way to grow our economy.<p>The Reform Government Surveillance would prevent us from passing reforms to locate European citizen data in Europe.

Any time I edit a new type of file, I look for packages that work well for it.<p>* helm, much better than flex matching for my purposes. I use helm for all list completion except find-file, for which I use ido-find-file. helm-git-grep completely changed the way I work with mixed-source RoR projects, to the point I&#x27;ve fully abandoned RubyMine.<p>* projectile, mostly just for finding files across a whole git repo. I use helm to complete the file to find (setq projectile-completion-system &#x27;helm-comp-read).<p>In addition, it helps enormously to not be afraid of Lisp. Emacs isn&#x27;t really worth it if you&#x27;re not interested in tweaking it, IMO. I had to tweak it quite a bit in order for it to play well with rxvt, my preferred terminal; and even further to get it to work well with screen in rxvt, and with mintty on Windows, and screen inside mintty. A familiarity with how termcap works, the esr&#x27;s showkey utility, and a bunch of time with define-key got it sorted.<p>Here&#x27;s a function I use a lot (bk-helm-occur at the end):<p><pre><code>  (defun get-point-text ()\n    &quot;Get &#x27;interesting&#x27; text at point; either word, or region&quot;\n    (if mark-active\n        (buffer-substring (mark) (point))\n      (thing-at-point &#x27;symbol)))\n  (defun helm-occur-1 (initial-value)\n    &quot;Preconfigured helm for Occur with initial input.&quot;\n    (setq helm-multi-occur-buffer-list (list (buffer-name (current-buffer))))\n    (helm-occur-init-source)\n    (helm :sources &#x27;helm-source-occur\n          :buffer &quot;*helm occur*&quot;\n          :history &#x27;helm-grep-history\n          :truncate-lines t\n          :input initial-value))\n  (defun bk-helm-occur ()\n    &quot;Invoke helm-occur with initial input configured from text at point&quot;\n    (interactive)\n    (helm-occur-1 (get-point-text)))\n  (global-set-key (kbd &quot;M-o&quot;) &#x27;bk-helm-occur)  \n</code></pre>\nIt lets me press Alt-O on any symbol and see all occurrences of that symbol in the file. I can then jump to uses, then use helm-resume to find the earlier occurrence and jump back. I have a similar function for a pre-initialized helm-git-grep.<p>It&#x27;s these kinds of customizations that make emacs shine. Any time you find yourself doing anything repetitive or tedious, you can usually hack a function up in a few minutes that improves your workflow. Prototyping Lisp functions is completely trivial owing to the ability to evaluate Lisp in the buffer.",1386584627

No matter how much variation there&#x27;s in your game if the algorithm to create it is simple people will quickly develop intuition about what to expect, and get bored.<p>The only game that I&#x27;ve seen doing procedural generation right is Dwarf Fortress, because it&#x27;s too complex to model it in your brain as you play.",1386583808

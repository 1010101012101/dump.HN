7478991,comment,7477801,7478702,18,0,colin_mccabe,,,"The brain stores information in physical ways that don&#x27;t get lost just because neural activity ceases for a while.  One way is in the physical layout of the brain (what neurons are connected to what) which changes over time.  Another is epigenetic changes in the genes of the neurons themselves which alter their behavior.  The brain isn&#x27;t a CPU or an artificial neural network where you turn off the power and lose all the state.<p>We&#x27;ve already known for a long time that people&#x27;s EEGs can flatline without wiping out their memories and personalities, so this isn&#x27;t exactly new information.

I read the whole article, but I missed the quote you excerpted. I am boggled by it. Systemic death means nothing if neurons don&#x27;t die (apoptosis) and the brain remains structurally intact - it&#x27;s structural and chemical properties of neurons that determine self, and if those are preserved then it&#x27;s fairly shallow notion of death. I mean, what does he say about people that suffer strokes or TBI and are completely changed by it, even though they never were clinically dead?  Sorry if I misinterpreted you, but you utilized the passive voice in a way that made it seem like you were strongly implying it.<p>edit: you may be unaware of the enormous structural complexity of the brain (see purkinje cells) and the fact that sensitivity to input can result in structural changes (synaptic plasticity).  It&#x27;s the graph structure of the billions of neurons and hundreds of trillions of connections combined with the structural changes at those connections that effect their sensitivity to neurotrasmitters - not the series of impulses at any point in time - that encodes self.",1395903441

Why? The ability to manage entire groups should be left to people higher up in the administration chain where individual users should be delegated to HR or other staff.<p>Bob should have permissions to manage users but not groups. Sally should have permissions to manage both. If Bob deletes a user, then Sally deletes the group, there should be no reason that Bob should be able to anything outside his domain. The group should not be restored and Bob should be given a clear, &#x27;plain English&#x27; reason why he can&#x27;t do such an action.<p>If both Sally and Bob are managers of a group and said situation occurs, no group should be restored when Bob restores a user. Only a readable error message should occur. In fact no data to be restored should be there in the first place unless it has been backed up or cached.<p>What is a possible solution to this logic?<p>1.) You could implement an optional backup system. All deletes are final in the context of the action. Think of a common tree structure: if no main branch is there to support a twig then no twig can hang. No restores via users can be performed until the group has been restored. The deleted data could be stored in a cache until certain parameters are met; once these are met the data is deleted (IE: Recycle Bin)<p>2.) Users could be restored belonging to a default group. If a recently deleted member of a recently deleted group needs to be restored, they could be assigned to a default &#x27;holding&#x27; group or other similar group with restricted permissions. This retains all specific user data which is not lost and by default the user will not be given extraneous or extra permissions. They can then be assigned to an appropriate group.<p>3.) Removing a group does not affect users within it. This is the opposite of a tree structure. This is analogous to Linux group and user permissions. A group can be assigned to users so they can access a resource. They are not interconnected in any way other than their usage to control permissions. Users can be removed and restored at will and so can groups.

When an earthquake hits, they are within a liquifaction zone. This is a zone that during earthquakes, behaves a little like a liquid.<p>The buildings they are putting up there, however, have foundations drilled down so deep, they are well in to the bedrock below. They aren&#x27;t going to come down.<p>I don&#x27;t know how I feel about being on the street if that happens, though.",1395900150

The console market is a different beast altogether.<p>> Instead of relying on a single instance of a product making money for years to come, focus more on new games<p>Sell it at a loss, make it up in volume? Right.<p>> or in-game content sales.<p>That's exactly what I DON'T want. Dragon Age has a guy in your camp with the ""I have a quest!"" marker above his head. Except it's a paid quest. And you can't make him go away. Die. And what, exactly, is supposed to prevent someone from pirating in-game content sales?<p>DRM sucks. But so do people. LGP is a small company fighting the good fight. They have clear evidence that piracy is taking place. There are only a few things they can do about it:<p>- Suck it up and take it. This is the route that most indie/small companies take. Estimates at the piracy rates from other indie devs seem to be about 80-90% [1][2][3].<p>- Build DRM like 2k games, using SecuROM and like technologies, that make users despise you. This option is expensive in both money and reputation.<p>- Build DRM like Steam or Stardock's Impulse, where the pain of DRM is offset by the community aspects and other perks. This option is expensive in money, but the reputation damage is minimal.<p>- Do something quick and simple. LGP seems to have implemented this option.<p>I posit[1] that DRM does reduce piracy. It cannot stop it, but it can reduce it. Most vendors try to come up with a 100% solution that turns out to be an 80% solution while screwing the legit user over. LGP has chosen to aim for an 80% solution, and I bet it will be just as effective as the other DRM schemes (which is to say, maybe 10-20% of people who would have pirated won't. It only has to pay for itself, remember!). The LGP solution isn't described in much detail, but if it works the way they claim (no internet connection, etc) it seems to fail open. How common is that? I really hope this works for them, because evidence that this works would be a great precedent.<p>Due to this scheme, when LGP says they're giving you a license for the game and not the game itself, they really <i>mean</i> it. They're giving you the benefits of a license-based scheme rather than just the usual punishments. This sort of scheme is <i>exactly</i> what I want the RIAA to implement; I want my collection in the cloud, and I want to be able to download and play the music on any computer I want, as many times as I want.<p>1) <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17350"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17350</a><p>2) <a href=""http://2dboy.com/2008/11/13/90/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://2dboy.com/2008/11/13/90/</a><p>3) <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/25809/TapFu_Developer_Claims_90_iPhone_Piracy_Rate.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/25809/TapFu_Developer_Cla...</a>",1268089188

Yes, Spring does not require iface proliferation - it just makes life easier when you decide you need different implementations of the same idea if you've committed to ifaces up front. YAGNI still holds true since it's usually easy enough to refactor in an interface when it does become necessary.<p>As far as comments about the ugliness of Java in this regard, I couldn't agree more. However, Java is Java and Python is Python, etc. If you are working in Java, and a lot of people are and don't have the option of switching to something else (think corporate, where what is common and familiar is good), if you are committed to Java, then you must embrace its paradigms.

We need to look at profits in the health care industry as similar to a VAT. If you have a profit margin at the end of the line, even if it's 18%, it's not that big of a deal. However, if each segment along the line adds a VAT, even a 5% tax of every segment can add up to a third of the cost, depending on how deep the pipeline goes. Each segment of the line is taking a profit. 3% of the health care industry, x% of the hospital (less than you would think because they subsidize so much of the uninsured) y% from the pharmaceutical industry, z% from the individually owned clinic...

The extreme disparity between CEO pay and other vital executives encourages people to backstab in order to ascend the hierarchy. So ""work"" for those who are in line to be CEOs is more about jockeying for position and trading favors than about building a company.<p>2. In addition to (1), such disparities are bad for morale, especially when the CEO is a ""hired gun"" instead of someone who has been part of the company for a long time.<p>Except in athletics, where talent is objectively measurable, the ""star system"" tends to piss off everyone but the stars, and let's be realistic: non-stars are 99% of people, and probably 3/4 of those who would be considered objectively the most competent.<p>3. When the CEO makes $500,000/year, he's drawing a good salary but still has the incentive to build a legitimately strong company for the long-term. When he has a ""performance bonus"" that will give him fuck-you money in 12 months if he plays his cards right, his incentives are in the short term.<p>4. When there are massive discrepancies in pay between the bosses and the people they are managing, the social class and lifestyle disconnects become problematic and can damage morale. This is why the best CEOs try to appear middle-class in terms of dress and work habits.<p>CEO pay is at such a level that it actually brings <i>lower</i> quality of management. This is what's truly alarming. Decades ago, when CEO pay was much lower, American companies were well-managed and produced great products like (imagine this for a second) cars that people actually wanted to buy. Now, big-company CEOs command stratospheric salaries and generally such ass. This is because executive pay is so high that it has pushed these people completely out of touch with reality.",1268087925

From Ars' point of view it would be great if these people shut of their ad blockers, but the advertisers would probably be getting the short end of the stick, in that case, which would (over the long term) drive advertising prices down, etc.  Ars would pick up some profits in the meantime, but solely at the expense of the advertisers, who are now getting screwed by paying for eyeballs that are worth less on average than the ones when people weren't shutting their ad blockers down.  I'd certainly pay less for per-impression ads on a site that wouldn't show content to people with an ad blocker, for this very reason.<p>It's a grand circle of life, and frankly, it's hard to say what second order effects any of these actions might have.  It very well may be that the presence of ad blockers raises the average value of the eyeballs that <i>do</i> see the ads enough that advertising prices end up higher and Ars does better overall.  It's equally possible that they're correct, the ad market hasn't adjusted to the presence of ad blockers yet, and they're still getting paid too little per-eyeball.  I'm not sure.  Neither are they.<p>But in theory, at least, over the long term, if people with ad blockers really aren't paying any attention to ads anyways, the market should correct for this and the results for both advertisers and the sites providing ad space should approach the true value.",1268086522

We've run donation systems in the past and they haven't really been worth maintaining, but I'm sure we'll consider running them again.

They'll tell you how many pages you have submitted, and how many are indexed.<p>While you're in Webmaster Tools, check out if your site has crawl errors. Check out the HTML suggestions.

What we have at the moment, where a lot of people get harangued by malicious advertisements, and a lot of people block even the most harmless ad content, is a really unfair to both sides. A way to auto-negotiate what you're willing to 'pay' would be excellent.  As things stand, I don't block ads, but I'd really like to be able to block the worst of them without screwing people over.<p>This would also separate out the people who are legitimately concerned about malware and excessively intrusive ads from those (sadly, I suspect, the majority) who simply don't want to pay for others' work.",1268085662

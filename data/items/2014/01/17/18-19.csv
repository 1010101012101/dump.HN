7077670,comment,7077234,7077234,55,0,drewcrawford,,,"At present I derive all my income from part-time work and side projects.<p>The first thing is to figure out what <i>not</i> to do.  You can&#x27;t work in a field where people routinely hire full-time employees with ease.  So you can&#x27;t do Java work part-time, for example.  (Well I mean you <i>can</i>, but it&#x27;s like saying you <i>can</i> be elected to Congress.  Let&#x27;s do something easy.)<p>So, you have to start in some field where 9-5ers can&#x27;t be easily found to fill the position.  iOS/Android dev are like that.  Maybe there are web specialities that are like that.  If you have some deep expertise like machine learning or computer vision or graph algorithms, maybe those specialties are like that.  But the operative criteria is to find some field that full-time employees are not easily had.<p>The next step is to filter by projects where time is not the biggest criteria.  Because in spite of Fred Brooks and his MMM, ordinary people still believe that if you work more hours the project will get done faster, and will pressure you to become full-time.  So you have to find people who are unconcerned about delivery dates, or rather, who have overriding concerns.  Quality concerns.  Cost concerns.  If you find someone who has a fixed budget for his project, for example, if that person can get a better developer at 20 hours/week than he can at 40 hours that starts to look like an attractive value proposition.  Because not only does he get a better developer, but with a lower burn rate it&#x27;s easier for him to get deep visibility into where the money and time is actually going.  Those benefits outweigh the benefits of completing the project faster, but only for projects that have these sorts of overriding concerns.<p>There&#x27;s more you can do, but those two steps are probably all you need to start consistently landing part-time gigs.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out as well, there are a variety of near-part-time deal structures you can negotiate (for example rotating 1 week on, 1 week off).  These might be worth exploring depending on your specific motivations for seeking part-time work.",1389984947

Remember, the whole point of Snowden going in with <i>sysadmin</i> access, and then stealing credentials and otherwise impersonating 20 other people, is precisely <i>because</i> the stuff Snowden wanted to leak was so compartmentalized.<p>Your 1) has already happened, AFAIK. Perhaps we need to have different (i.e. more active and intrusive) Congressmen on the subcommittee so that they don&#x27;t act so shocked when details come out, but that&#x27;s a different issue.<p>Another key note is that unlike almost every other subcommittee, these Congressional overseers don&#x27;t get the ability for political patronage out of what they do. The Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, for instance, can be greatly influential in drawing massive DoD dollars to their district, but there&#x27;s not much the Intelligence committees can do in the same vein, aside from random data centers perhaps.<p>Even then, I know there was a determination by Sen. Feinstein earlier that EO 12333 collection was not in their oversight bailiwick. That wasn&#x27;t NSA refusing to discuss it, it was the subcommittee deciding it was out of their jurisdiction.<p>There are many Federal agencies and groups that <i>do</i> monitor EO 12333 (though it is certainly unclear what type of oversight they are providing across the totality of programs).<p>Beyond all that, I do agree that nothing going on within NSA should be out-of-scope for oversight (including Congressional oversight, if it comes to it). From the nuclear propulsion perspective, we had routine audits of essentially every major program, institutionalized. I don&#x27;t know how the Congressional subcommittees do their business but it would be a good idea to institute the same there, and also ensure that NSA/IC staff (contractors too) can always feel comfortable coming to a staffer from that Congressional subcommittee with details of abuses.<p>I&#x27;d give the NSA some credit on security through obscurity because you&#x27;re talking about intelligence programs, not computer code or algorithms. A rule of thumb from crypto research does not necessarily directly apply to anything with the word &quot;communications&quot; in it. ;)<p>In fact the only real problem I see in 3) is that (assuming you&#x27;re talking about public discussion) the people who most need to care (the American <i>public</i>) are going to have their eyes glaze over immediately, the people who might actually be able to craft countermeasures would be intensely interested, and it wouldn&#x27;t even prevent government abuse; how easy is it to craft a good system of access controls for public approval but then add workarounds as needed in practice?",1389984750

Recent syslog-ng comes with one built in.<p>There&#x27;s so much confusion over /etc/rc, /etc/init.d, /etc/rc?.d, init(8), inittab(5), initscript(5), what they are and how they are related.  Getting the machine setup an in a usable state should be divorced from the services that the machine runs, but this is a fine line.  Personally, I consider a machine &quot;usable&quot; if the filesystems are mounted, the machine is network accessible, and a configuration management system starts and/or sshd is running so one can login (and even then, this last one is not a strict requirement).  Service management beyond that should be handled as just another process running.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that systemd is being pushed as an init(8) replacement, and doesn&#x27;t seem to support running as a service itself.  This being the default, with the <i>option</i> to replace init(8), would most likely lessen the controversy and reduce risk as systemd is developed and rolled out.  &quot;Look, you&#x27;ve been doing process management of individual services with systemd already, and you see the benefits; did you know that systemd can also replace init, to get those benefits system-wide?&quot;  It&#x27;s not presented like that, however.",1389983916

What, however, would happen if they all decided to go into STEM instead? Assuming they all did amazing, we&#x27;d wind up with a glut of people with degrees in &quot;good&quot; subjects, which does nothing to magically create jobs (having a STEM degree does NOT mean you&#x27;re going to start a company!) - it only helps where there are shortages. Once those are filled, we&#x27;re back where we started (and wages may get pushed down due to a talent glut.) That&#x27;s the best case scenario, too. What would be worse? What would the reality likely be? If everyone did rush into STEM, a good portion would fail out (not everyone is cut out for it. Really, some people just do not have the attitude, mindset, demeanor, worldview, interest, etc.) and be left with no degree (or they&#x27;d switch to one of those useless ones) and still be debt - right back where we started again. For some real world examples, just look through some other discussions on HN about this subject about people in countries who DO exactly this and they&#x27;re stuck with unemployed and underemployed STEM grads up the wazoo.&#x27;",1389983899

7077541,comment,7075608,7077154,6,0,electronvolt,,,"This unfortunately happens fairly routinely even at high level universities.  Not always as publicly, though, but it does happen.<p>I&#x27;m a faculty brat (professorial parents) at one of the top public universities in the nation. There are always students that will complain to professors that things are too hard, or that grading schemes are unfair, or etc. with very little cause. Possibly worse is that sometimes people&#x27;s /parents/ will call or email their professor to appeal a grade.<p>It does seem to be somewhat major dependent:  I have /never/ seen it occur in a math class, for instance, whereas it apparently routinely occurs in my mother&#x27;s English classes. (She&#x27;s known for grading more stringently than many other English professors. Complaints also don&#x27;t usually work.)  However, I think that it&#x27;s a mark of an experienced teacher that they don&#x27;t let bullshit like that faze them: the one time I&#x27;ve seen it really affect how a class was taught, it definitely made the class worse as a learning experience. (Some vocal computer science majors thought that an algorithms course was too difficult, and the professor made it easier, which definitely was a net loss for everyone. I&#x27;m very glad that I wasn&#x27;t enrolled in it.)<p>I think it&#x27;s disgusting.  Sometimes professors make mistakes: in class structure, or assignment load, or grading something, or the like, and bringing that up politely is appropriate.  But if they know they are assigning hard, long assignments, or the grading is fair, or the like, then it&#x27;s usually for a good reason.  The professors who don&#x27;t care about teaching usually also don&#x27;t teach hard courses or grade harshly, because it means more work for them.<p>I agree that generally the people who do things like this are less likely to do well post-college. Either because their parents are hovering over them (see parental phone calls) and they won&#x27;t ever learn self-discipline and reliance, or because they expect that if they complain, the world will magically bend itself to their will.  I think some of it happens when people are taking courses they don&#x27;t want to take for a requirement, but I agree that there are a good number of people who get sold on the &quot;college degree -> good job and happiness and money.&quot;",1389983710

Some are pure ignorance: for example, most people do not know how tenuous the security of the Internet already is, and thus how harmful it is to try to actively subvert it.  But those can only really be part of the story; security protocols seemingly haven&#x27;t been affected all that much in practice (c.f. Dual EC&#x27;s brokenness in OpenSSL), and the core question of whether it is acceptable to spy on private communications doesn&#x27;t really depend on technical details (indeed, there was plenty of anger over just spying on plain-old-telephone-service records, which most of the people here <i>don&#x27;t</i> know those details about).  So I would also nominate...<p>- More technically inclined people have more (for some, I&#x27;d say an order of magnitude more, however you want to define that) of their life online, so they (a) have more data online and thus more to lose, and (b) tend to care much more about anything which affects their activities, since it is more important to them.<p>- Having a connection, direct or broad, with the technologies and the people responsible for securing things can make their subversion feel more violating; so can knowing that many things (email, Google&#x27;s backend) could have been secured better but weren&#x27;t, partially due to a false belief that the US Internet didn&#x27;t need to be treated as an adversary.<p>- Connections in the &quot;tech community&quot; causing a bandwagon effect in topics that spread well beyond technology itself.   In the context of one forum, such as this one, this is quite clear (the political norm here is very far from the mainstream in areas that have nothing to do with tech); less so the more broadly you define the community, but I think there is some group bias to be found even if you include every programmer in the US.",1389983510

There isn&#x27;t a &quot;standard CRUD app&quot; that people are building with front-end js, often js is just being used for a single effect or widget.<p>2) Performance tradeoffs are very tangible to end-users. For instance, in most cases, straight HTML is still lighter and snappier than an AngularJS app (until you click on something, then that&#x27;s another tradeoff) but an app served by 2 rails servers will usually be indiscernible from one served by 1 sinatra server.<p>With rails, you can say that the performance penalties are worth productivity gains because those penalties are really only going to effect deployment costs, not the UX. With JS, every extra bit you add to your framework is going to effect UX.<p>For me, the biggest pain is still dependency management. Bower is great for pulling stuff in but then I have to blend it with requirejs or an AMD loader or hand-wire it into my html. Likewise, when I want to remove something I have to touch a bunch of files. I&#x27;d love to just be able to &quot;bower install backbone&quot; and get back to writing code but building such a feature would require bower to be able to understand my project&#x27;s structure.",1389983432

Package managers are a time saving device, and these days they&#x27;re generally very good. If you have a need that isn&#x27;t met by a modern package manager, I can&#x27;t help but think it&#x27;s an exceptionally niche use case.<p>I used to compile many of my packages from source because of tunings that weren&#x27;t present in the pre-built packages or pre-built packages that weren&#x27;t available/out of date (this was probably on FreeBSD some 10+ years ago, although I&#x27;m reluctant to include building from ports in this because that is mostly automated and doesn&#x27;t <i>really</i> count). But when I migrated to Gentoo where builds are automated (and then to Arch) and later experienced the Debian/Ubuntu side of things, I began to appreciate what a colossal waste of time it was to dig through configure options, set flags, etc., much less doing everything else manually. It&#x27;s just more convenient to allow the platform itself to take care of things or offload worrying about dependencies to the package maintainer who probably knows more about building these packages than I do (or care to).<p>Again, it&#x27;s not to disparage the value of building from source (or knowing how), but I have other things I&#x27;d rather put my time into, like whining about compiling from source. ;)",1389983322

Typeclasses enable polymorphism in Haskell and polymorphism allows for boilerplate reduction and code reuse. Monads can be factored out using typeclasses and usually are in Haskell. You use monads whether or not you&#x27;re using Haskell and whether or not your language has built-in state manipulation. Certain types in Haskell are monadic and thus provide examples of functionality which shares that common pattern. Haskell exploits all of this in many ways. First, by tagging effects with types you have better documentation and safer programs. Second, by organizing many distinct types along their common monadic pattern you reduce boilerplate and provide a simple API. Third, by exploiting that API generically you build up a set of language constructs which operate &quot;over all monads&quot; which makes for a powerful construction kit. Fourth, by exploiting some algebraic structure that is a natural consequence of the generic pattern of monads you can decompose and recombine them into what are called transformer stacks.<p>Monads have no relation whatsoever to boilerplate reduction besides the fact that if you (a) notice their existence and (b) operate in a language with powerful enough generics then you can factor that common pattern to reduce boilerplate using that generics support.<p>If you recognize monads exist and don&#x27;t have generics support you can still use the concept to better analyze your code and seek out ways of layering in new effects if desirable.

NSA can&#x27;t be completely outside of elected governance.  There should be NO level of access that is &quot;too classified&quot; for this committee.  If &quot;super access&quot; like that needs to exist in some fashion it should NOT be under the jurisdiction of the NSA.  As it stands, that excuse is a loophole that undermines the concept of oversight and the NSA is way too big of an organization to have that power.  Just moving &quot;super secret&quot; stuff to a smaller, more concentrated organization would improve things immensely.<p>2) Clear and open communication over access rights.

That project has no direct equivalent to any of the current frameworks, other than approximately following MVC for its overall architecture and using message passing/publish-subscribe in various places to keep things modular and testable.<p>I imagine you could achieve some of the same behaviour using data binding tools in modern frameworks, but either way you&#x27;re typically looking at a little boilerplate to connect things up in the first place and then one-liners to connect individual fields from a model to the corresponding parts of the DOM. It&#x27;s not clear whether there would be any savings at all, but if there were, they wouldn&#x27;t be significant for any framework I&#x27;ve considered so far. In any case, that represents a tiny fraction of the overall code base for this application.<p><i>IME any application which grows that large without using a framework ends up inventing its own.</i><p>All software has an architecture, sure. As with any framework vs. library debate, you&#x27;re trading off the benefits of having some of that architecture predetermined for you and having some of the laborious plumbing work dealt with automatically against the overhead of managing a major external dependency and any extra costs you incur if you need to do something that goes against its natural capabilities. Sometimes using a framework is a win, and sometimes it isn&#x27;t.<p><i>If the code&#x27;s maintainable by people other than its original author you&#x27;ve presumably ...</i><p>You&#x27;ve made some assumptions there about how web apps work, but they aren&#x27;t necessarily true.<p>For example, much of the complexity in this particular UI comes from providing many views of the same underlying model. Some of them are graphical rather than text/form based. Some of those rely on intermediate cached data structures for their source data because rerendering an entire view from the raw data in the model can be prohibitively slow. We have an efficient and simple architecture using the same basic principles as MVC for dealing with this kind of caching. We&#x27;d derive very little benefit here from the kinds of data-binding and template-rendering functionality found in the major frameworks.<p>Just to be clear, libraries designed to render interactive graphical page elements efficiently, allowing for portability across browsers and different image/scene formats, are another question entirely. I&#x27;m not arguing for reinventing the wheel or arguing against using tried-and-tested code from external sources. I&#x27;m just arguing that it should only be done when the benefits outweigh the costs, and that this won&#x27;t necessarily be the case when considering whether or not to use one of the modern JS frameworks as the foundation for your web app.",1389982869

7077392,comment,7076632,7077026,3,0,mpyne,,,"As a father of a child with autism myself, I&#x27;d <i>hesitate</i> to leave the prevalence of libertarian and anti-authoritarian tendencies in tech to such a simple explanation... but I&#x27;ll admit there are parallels.<p>The &quot;theory of mind&quot; is a known challenge (<i>not</i> an impossibility) with those with autism [1]. This is basically the degree of awareness a person has on the fact that other persons have their own thoughts, prejudices, levels of knowledge, etc. Essentially the idea, can you put yourself in the mind or worldview of someone else?<p>With the types of libertarianism followed in the U.S. there is simply no need to <i>care</i> what other people think: The idea is that the rules are simple and easy to follow, and as long as they&#x27;re rigidly applied <i>anything that happens</i> must be fair.<p>When you combine the difficulty of understanding why other people feel the way they do, with the very real awareness of how intelligent and knowledgeable our prototypical tech libertarian is, it starts to make sense <i>why</i> they believe that the outcome of these rules are fair. <i>They</i> are able to motivate to work, <i>they</i> are able to produce good work (at least, in their opinion), <i>they</i> follow the rules that respect others&#x27; things; why can&#x27;t <i>you</i>?<p>When you scale that up to the idea that a society of people all trying their best to do good work and live by the rules <i>must</i> obtain the ideal outcome, the appeal is more understandable, if not actually obvious. Why should the government tell a person how to live or what to do, when that person obviously knows best what&#x27;s good for them, especially when government in general has long historical examples of failure. Even if you point out successes of regulation, the rejoinder is simply that such successes <i>could</i> be replicated with the simple set of rules, if people would only follow them. And either way, how difficult could it be to make rules that are good at an individual level also be good at a national level?<p>The problem with the failure to understand the theory of mind is probably most pronounced with that last question... a difference in scale has always been a difference in kind, but how can you perceive that what&#x27;s best for society is not always what&#x27;s best for one person, when you can hardly understand that other individual people are not mirror images of oneself, let alone understanding societies at a macro level?<p>All the same, this is all just a bunch of supposition. I am sure there are better explanations (though I should hope that it&#x27;s not considered surprising that one&#x27;s ability for empathy, sympathy and theory of mind may play a role in one&#x27;s natural political tendencies).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.autism.com/index.php/understanding_theoryofmind"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.autism.com/index.php/understanding_theoryofmind</a>",1389982535

I assume you consider that their problems are, at least partly, a consequence of poor wealth distribution and poor governance of the powers that be.<p>Libertarians, as much as most other political thinkers (of non-Machiavelli type) care about roughly the same thing: well-being of people. It just so happens that the libertarian discourse is usually concentrated around rather deep root causes: unjust property laws, the seizure of power and wealth by the elite, obstacles built by elites that prevent people from producing their own subsistence.<p>This is a bit different from, let&#x27;s call it, philanthropic discourse that usually concentrates on more immediate problems, e.g. providing hunger relief or better education in affected regions. These problems can be very serious and long-term (like elimination of diseases that may take decades) but usually are not about principal changes in the structure of the society.<p>There are, of course, other schools of thought that offer deep social changes to help people live better. But a significant number of geeks is attracted by libertarian ideas because they are so minimalist (as compared to e.g. socialism, as seen in much of Europe) and so pro-freedom (as compared to e.g. corporate etatism as seen e.g. in Singapore or Russia).<p>On topic: unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know about a philanthropic geek community hub. My philanthropic activity is limited to monetary donations.

Subordination doesn&#x27;t seem hard to handle in such a system; a duke&#x27;s word, for example, would be God-given law save where it happened to conflict with the dictates of the Queen, an earl&#x27;s likewise in relation to a duke, and on down the line, and presumably such conflicts could be handled by any noble of higher rank than the one found to be in conflict -- an earl, for example, might censure an unruly baron.<p>…come to think about it, given a few global string replacements, haven&#x27;t we just more or less reinvented both the British peerage and the Roman Catholic Church?",1389982408

In this society, every exchange of wealth occurs between pairs of randomly chosen individuals. On each of these exchanges, more skilled individuals have advantage in relation to the less skilled ones and some individuals are more willing to make business than others.<p>I thought about a simple model to simulate a society such as the one described above. Considering that skill is randomly distributed, I was hoping that, after some simulation runs, about half the population would prosper while the rest would be in debt. To my surprise, the society rapidly converges to an inequality scenario where 90% of the population ends in debt! Then, I decided to check the influence of taxes.<p>To simulate the influence of taxes, suppose that on each exchange a tax is collected. The amount collected from the taxes is then homogeneously distributed among the entire population.<p>Experimentally, I verified that a tax rate of about 20% is needed to guarantee a stabilization of the society where only 50% falls in debt.<p>Simulation code is as follows: http://pastebin.com/N4g6ATuW",1389981914

7077296,comment,7076294,7076601,7,0,Karellen,,,"Debian &quot;unstable&quot; is the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; version. New packages go in there on a pretty frequent basis, and things change often. Sometimes there is breakage. I would strongly advise against running this unless you&#x27;re capable of and willing to fix serious breakage every now and then. And dealing with package upgrade conflicts. Sometimes you can&#x27;t just &quot;update everything&quot;, because someone just uploaded X version 2.1, only package Y has a strict versioned dependency on X <= 2.0, so you need to decide what you want.<p>I used &quot;unstable&quot; on my desktop for a while, but once every 2-3 years I&#x27;d end up with a bug that would break the early boot process, and I&#x27;d have to muck around with rescue disks and chroots and reconfiguring grub and the like. So I&#x27;d advise against this, unless you want to actually get involved in the Debian project.<p>Now I run &quot;testing&quot; on my desktop. When packages have been in &quot;unstable&quot; for a certain period of time (typically 10 days, although this is changing) without having a Release Critical (RC) bug filed against them, and if the move won&#x27;t break any other packages, then &quot;unstable&quot; packages migrate to &quot;testing&quot;. It&#x27;s fairly up-to-date, although sometimes a large group of packages that need to transition all at once will take a while to synchronise.[0] And there are explicit &quot;transitions&quot; for some widely-used base libraries when they undergo ABI changes.[1] But you generally don&#x27;t need to worry about this, as it&#x27;ll mostly happen behind the scenes.<p>Still, if you&#x27;re going to run &quot;testing&quot;, I would still recommend installing apt-listbugs, which will tell you if there are any new RC bugs in any packages you&#x27;re about to install/update (e.g. that were discovered only after the package migrated to testing), and allow you to decline the update.<p>Then, every couple of years or so, Debian is &quot;frozen&quot; for a few months, and no new updates are allowed that don&#x27;t fix RC bugs. Once all the RC bugs have been fixed, and these fixes have all migrated to &quot;testing&quot;, that version of &quot;testing&quot; becomes the new &quot;stable&quot;. (&quot;unstable&quot; and &quot;testing&quot; can get a bit out-of-date during this time, but generally not too badly). &quot;stable&quot; is then &quot;stable&quot; in that it doesn&#x27;t change at all, except for security updates, until the next &quot;stable&quot; is released a couple of years later. (There is also &quot;backports&quot; which packages newer releases of some software to go on top of stable, but you can&#x27;t really rely on anything in particular getting a backport version.) This is handy for large deployments where you need to support users who will freak if their menus move around, or servers, or if you want to create your own distro and need an unchanging base platform to work from.<p>If you&#x27;re moderately technical, and want fairly up-to-date shiny, I&#x27;d recommend Debian &quot;testing&quot;. If you&#x27;re interested in Free Software in and of itself, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.[2]<p>[0] <a href=""https://release.debian.org/migration/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://release.debian.org/migration/</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://release.debian.org/transitions/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://release.debian.org/transitions/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.debian.org/social_contract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.debian.org/social_contract</a>",1389981671

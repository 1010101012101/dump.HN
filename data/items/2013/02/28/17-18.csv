Other perks put in place also helped boost the morale of the rank-and-file a little bit. But it appears she thinks about morale and vibe as quantifiable, something that can be managed relative to the available morale quotient that she can tap.<p>If this is part of an overall strategy, Mayer looks like someone who only knows how to manage things on paper using spreadsheets. I'm sure she's trying to replicate many of the successful approaches she took at Google, but Google and Yahoo are not the same.<p>This nursery story just adds to my impression of her that she's tone-deaf to how her actions affect the organization.",1362074395

5299909,comment,5296898,5298691,1,0,will_brown,,,">I clicked your links and I read your description but I don't get how they are tied together. For example, how does your opening sentence have anything to do with the Google Docs links?<p>I would have posted a link to the live search engine, but as the OP says it ""folded"" after a year, so I did the next best thing and gave links to 2 screen shots of example search results pages. Sorry, I just do not understand why the description of my search engine leaves you lost, especially to the point you feel the description and actual screen shots are not tied together - the only difference between the description and screen shots is that because they are screen shots you do not have the benefit of continuing to scroll down and have infinite results populate, also most of the results are not favicons but custom uploaded logos (but I mention that function in the OP).<p>>are you trying to offer a more visual display for the favicon next to the search results? Is that your ""differentiator"" I assume? I'm just so lost here.<p>As the links show, my results display the favicon only - no text based results.<p>>EDIT: No one wants a ""web search engine that displays results as an infinite list of favicons by default."" People might want to view the favicon next to the search results but no one wants an ""infinite list of favicons by default.""<p>I asked for insight, but ouch.  Did I shut it down for lack of traction? Yes, but starting from day 1 I had over 10,000 queries/day so I would not say ""no one wants"".<p>Besides I can build a search engine right now that people do want, that does not mean anyone will jump ship from Google for it. For example, I know from posts on HN that people have been waiting for years for Google to permit infinite results (see: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4875463"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4875463</a>) instead of x results per page, so in minutes I could create a Google API search engine that provides identical results to Google and offers infinite results on the first page - but do you know how many people will use it?  None, and for anyone who thinks it is as easy as building something people want, then test your theory now and build the infinite Google search engine that people on HN have posted about and see if building something people want actually gets people using your engine instead of Google.<p>Disclosure:  I know you commented on the post I linked above about infinite scrolling, specifically that you do not like infinite scrolling for web search but you like it for image searches - a reply comment to yours was another HN user saying they prefer the infinate scroll feature of DuckDuckGo but find the actual Google results to be better quality.",1362074347

It may make good business sense - Richard Branson certainly seems to think it does, but that's not a moral issue, it's a strategic one.  If good employees who have options no longer wish to work for yahoo, they will leave.<p>I do think Yahoo managed this poorly from a PR perspective.  I think it would have been wiser to announce Yahoo's plans to make the campus a perfect place to be, with everything a working parent could want.  Play up the daycare, gym, dry cleaning.  If they're not doing this, start a plan or two and make a big deal about it.  I'm speaking cynically here, this is about managing the press.

Preview should be immune to these.<p>Aside from that it's mostly market share - they're different code bases, so they'd need different attacks.  There is a chance of buffer overflow issues in the font decoding, image decoding, certificate processing, etc.  But outside of iOS, few people have made the effort to attack non-adobe PDF Readers.<p>Something like Chrome or Firefox is likely to be the most secure choice. Firefox's PDF reader is written in javascript, and I believe chrome's is sitting in a process that can't do anything to your machine.

I have a rather unique perspective on the war. He also showed me the road where Stukas gunned down fleeing Parisians in 1940. He showed me the trenches and the woods where people would run to and hide. We used to walk around in those woods. It's near Nemours, in Seine-et-Marne. His son (my grandfather) was the commander of a tank unit in 1940. He was captured and sent to a work camp in Germany, near Baden-Baden. He returned in 1942, to work the more fertile french farm. My mother was born in '43. There were two SS officers quartered at the house, in the upstairs bedroom. I slept in the same beds when I stayed with them. The more senior of the SS officers, according to my great grandmother, made sure that my mother had eggs and milk in the first year of her life. They left in June of 44 and she did not hear of them again. She told me the younger one came home crying one evening. She asked him what had happened. They were sitting on the stone doorsteps, side by side, just as she and I were when she told me the story 35 years later. He said, through sobs, that US bombers had bombed his town and killed his entire family. His parents, grandparents, sister, and much younger brother. Last but not least, my great grandfather told me that in July of 44, an american bomb exploded near our house, in the rear field, and a shapnel fragment broke a hole in the back courtyard door, raced across the yard, barely missing my mother's head by 20cm, then crashed into the water cistern. He then walked over and ran his finger over the discolored patch. He said: ""This is where the hole was.""<p>All this to say that while I have read the history books, some in French and never translated into English (apparently some french material isn't suitable for a British audience's taste and sensibilities), I also have some more intimate knowledge that transcends the written page and the maps with arrows and dashed lines.<p>Note that I don't disagree with you, and as you point out, it was partly new technology that won the war for the allies.",1362073475

Feed these impulses into a robot's control interface/""API"", and the user's brain will be able to adaptively learn to control the various functions offered (e.g. flick a finger to make the robot's hand perform the same action). Even better, the robot uses a learning algorithm to associate the nervous data with the correct action through feedback from the user, so that eventually, the user's moving his hand causes the robot to do the same. Voila, exo-suits controlled directly  by the brain.<p>If you can pass data back into the brain through the jack, you can return tactile feedback from the robot arm, or even sensations that represent other information, e.g. light or gas levels in the environment detected by mechanical sensors. I doubt human brains can process information that doesn't fit in our spectrum of senses, e.g. mathematical patterns, or abstract conceptual knowledge like an understanding of democracy, but maybe they can accept visualizations or memory vignettes generated by other users. Brains are adaptive and can learn to process unfamiliar stimuli.<p>It's all far in the future and raises a lot of strange and worrisome questions, but it's interesting to think about.",1362072350

It takes a lot more effort and money to move a large mass.<p>> Kindly explain how some foreign countries with highly regulated or state-operated telecommunications companies already have faster internet connections than major American cities.<p>Because their infrastructure decisions come after our infrastructure decisions.<p>It takes N years to ""wire"" a large city like Los Angeles.  After that you have to get your money back.  Yes, that is not a criminal act.  Meanwhile country ""X"", many years later, looks at what was done in Los Angeles, checks out the more current technological offerings and installs a system that yes, probably leapfrogs what the average customer in Los Angeles has.<p>The true test would be the next evolutionary step.  When a city like Los Angeles is ready to make the next big shift in connectivity it will be really neat.  Country ""X"" will then fall behind and it will probably be very, very difficult for them to make the next leap 'cause, well, they have to pay for the investment just as well.<p>The technology that is going to make a huge difference is fiber to the home.  We already have it in certain places in Los Angeles.  I happen to know that there's fiber in the telco box right outside my house.  Why?  I saw it being installed fifteen years ago.  Not lit yet.  It will be, eventually.  Fiber is great in that you can greatly enhance transmission rates by driving it differently.  There's probably a few more evolutionary steps ahead of us before fiber bandwidth is tapped out.<p>There's another issue a lot of people might not consider when thinking about upgrading the infrastructure of a country like the US.  If tomorrow we all had 1Gb/s service at home and at work it would probably crash the Internet.  The infrastructure required in order to support something like that at our scale is massive and cost a ton of money.  I don't know if costs are geometric or exponential. They are huge.  A small country has advantages here as well.<p>No, government and regulation is not the solution.  It never is.",1362071267

5299583,comment,5298417,5298417,63,0,trotsky,,,"Having read through the entire thread instead of just the expletives, in my opinion it's a rare case of Linux and Greg being totally wrongheaded on the issue.<p>The problem crops up because redhat submitted a pull request to enhance the existing in kernel live inclusion of additional trusted x.509 certificates. Note that this is 100% upstream and live. The pull was to add the ability to extract these x.509 certificates from UEFI PE binaries, as this is the only format they are available in from the only CA UEFI secure boot computers are guaranteed to trust - Microsoft's CA.<p>Linus decided he didn't like it because he didn't like the idea of extracting a certificate instead of having it alone. Understandable, probably, except that leaves you in a situation where a secure kernel that was executed due to a microsoft CA chain of trust now can't make use of that CA's code signing services to decide if it wants to run a module solely because linus doesn't approve of parsing the file format that contains the key.<p>The biggest place this comes up is binary only graphics drivers from ati and nvidia - without changes os's like fedora are going to refuse to run them because they're unsigned, which is unfortunate considering how uneven some of the open source 3d drivers are and the heavy reliance on 3d in all modern desktops environments.<p>Meanwhile microsoft is perfectly willing to sign these drivers and has an existing substantial CA operation. Both ati and nvidia submit their windows drivers for signing to this CA all the time, so it'd be almost no extra effort for them to get their linux shims signed as well.<p>But because linus thinks parsing a PE for a signed module key is asinine, he goes on to provide a series of rather off the cuff alternatives:<p>a) Every distro should parse the PEs and add every key of every 3rd part module they wish to allow to run and embed these in their signed kernels, issuing a new kernel every time a driver revs.<p>b) ok, maybe that's not ideal. how about every distro that wants to allow binary drivers to run builds their own CA infrastructure, verification and qualification team and revocation infrastructure. So that's a team at cannonical, redhat, novell, mint, oracle, ibm, etc. etc.<p>c) ok, maybe full ca teams are a bit burdensome. How about all you distro guys just blind sign the binary drivers with your own signing key - worrying that MS might revoke your key because you blind signed an exploit is pointless fearmongering.<p>d) ok, you're right this is harder than i thought. let's just collectively decide that users with secure boot enabled will be prevented from running any module not shipped by the os vendor. Aka fuck off unless you're using intel video.<p>e) alright, maybe that's a little severe. Instead let's just punt entirely - even though we're going through the trouble of  a chain of trust from firmware to boot loader to kernel to most modules, let's allow any unsigned binary module to be loaded by default.<p>f) ok, i guess that kind of defeats the purpose. None of this is good security anyway - what we should be requiring is any user that wants to use secure boot should generate their own signing keys, add them to the firmware and then parse and sign everything they trust, repeating the process every time they update while of course protecting the signing key from attackers.<p>I think that about covers it. Linus is really smart, but sometimes he makes a snap decision and then will perform whatever mental gymnastics are necessary to defend it to the death. And most of his inner circle will publicly go along with it because of the real chance he'll pay you back by randomly torpedoing something of yours sometime in the future.<p>Linux's signed code infrastructure is currently the worst in the industry and Matthew and Redhat have provided the bulk of the improvements that everyone is using. It's going to provide real user benefit, even if the users are paralyzed by FUD. Getting in the way of the process or trying to punt it out of mainline and onto everyone who ships a distro isn't going to help anyone.",1362071117

5299565,comment,5298902,5298902,3,0,cpleppert,,,"The author structured his article as a rant and it shows, so I won't respond to every point. The central premise of his post is that B&N is in an innovators dilemma situation and will find it impossible to build ereaders. Then the author suggests it should build a reading app instead and just plow all its resources into that. Except it would have no content network behind it. Ergo:<p>>>Or, if B&N can talk publishers off the DRM ledge and onto the watermarking perch, they could just switch to using iBooks when on iOS and have a book delivery app that doesnt do anything but notify people when new books are ready to be copied into iBooks.<p>Wow, why isn't this guy CEO? So in other words Amazon and B&N should get rid of their delivery networks and build a better reading application that will compete against apple which has:<p>1) a device 2) a content delivery network 3) a proprietary delivery format that they can add new features to 4) a builtin application<p>And the value proposition is the reader app is better? Well, it if its you don't need to do anything the author suggests. You just need to improve your e-reading application.<p>The author confuses needing to understand where the market is going with making up a fantasy world where nothing you have done to support your existing business should be accepted.",1362070843

It also means there is an upper cap on your income.  The upper cap is the amount of tax saved.  As your price approaches that number, the likelihood of a ""yes"" decreases.<p>Do not set your pricing based on easily quantifiable criteria, unless you're working on huge deals where you can take a small fraction of the value as compensation.  (By small I mean low single digit percentages).<p>The second is where the true value sits.  People are willing to exchange money for a peaceful brain.  People are willing to exchange money in exchange for more time in their lives.  It is here that personal value choice discontinuities work in your favor.  Set your pricing based on intangibles.<p>A business owner is willing to throw money at a problem to not have to think about the problem at all.  This frees up the owner's brain to think about stuff that really matters and will make money.<p>An hour spent by a CEO looking at tax returns could be an hour taken away from making a deal that brings in $1 million for the company.  It's worth spending $1,000 to make the problem go away.  You are happy to take the $1,000 because it takes you $125 of time input to solve that problem.<p>I have seen this with very large companies.  There is a reason why their compensation packages include ""your employer will pay for a lawyer, accountant, and personal financial planner.""  You don't want an executive with 10,000 employees under him/her to be sweating credit card payments, or ""Is my will up to date?"" or any trivia like that.<p>Moreso, however, I see this with entrepreneur-driven companies.  The owner is the manager and this person's time is incredibly valuable and should not be spent on trivia, especially emotion-laden trivia.",1362070828

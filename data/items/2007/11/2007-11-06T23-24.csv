So is that true? How many technologies do you know? And to count, you need to have developed more than two systems that went into production and has real, live users.<p>If you know more than 2 or 3 of these technologies, speak out! You can help make me look like an idiot. (Not that I need help, most days!)",1194392598
76817,story,,,1,0,shayan,"Ask YC: Did Facebook F*** Microsoft?",,"this is a quote from TechCrunch regarding Facebook's social ad announcement, earlier today (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=76722"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=76722</a>)<p>""Big point: Microsoft won't be serving Social Ads. This will be controlled by Facebook. Zuckerberg clarifies: ""Microsoft is the exclusive third-party provider of IAB standard ads. This is not going to go through Microsoft. We think it is a different kind of advertising.""""<p>The only reason I could see why Microsoft would purchase so little of shares in Facebook for so much money (i.e. the 15b valuation, buying 1.6% for 240M$) was the advertising exclusivity they got in their contract.  But now Facebook doesn't want to give them all the ads???? <p>If the Social Ads will be as efficient and as successful as Facebook is hoping then how would there be room for any IAB standard ads? wouldn't all companies just want to do the social ad instead?<p>(I know Microsoft was also trying to get in and try to cut Google out, but the point was to get in and take advantage not to get in, get Google out and give all the power to Facebook)",1194392311

Instead, I'm moving down to some of the more interesting ones.<p>Do you really think most readers have 8 languages under their belt, with real, live, production systems written in them? It would be interesting to put on an AskYC question. I don't know the answer one way or another. For some reason I kind of thought most of the readers, while super hot on the technology, were newer to the party than that.",1194392159

Just because a smallish-yet-largish (hundreds? thousands?) community of people has got together and decided to show their support for a particular candidate by overparticipating in online polls and social news sites doesn't mean that there's anybody organizing these people. <p>Of course they must be exchanging information somehow, but it doesn't look to me like anybody in particular is in charge.

76812,comment,76604,76604,0,0,greendestiny,,,"If you go to the store without much prior knowledge and grab an expensive bottle of the shelf your chances of getting something great aren't that high. Some things to consider: wines sell for the same price whether or not it was a good or a bad year. A premium wine in a bad year is likely to be less enjoyable than a cheap wine in good year. Premium wines are generally made to be aged, so if you don't cellar your wines you are wasting your money buying an expensive wine. Even the snobbiest wine collector doesn't suggest there is a linear relationship between price and enjoyment, but premium wines generally take more effort to make.<p>A lot of the quality of a wine comes down to the fruit. Do you doubt your ability to identify a beautiful strawberry? ",1194391670

I believe many people have been waiting for this news for quite some time now? this means a huge deal to Facebook's future and also all the other exsisting networks and bigger companies such as Google and Microsoft... this is the kind of reason why Microsoft would value the company at 15b$ and why Google would feel threaten and come up with OpenSocial and be able to convince everyone to join",1194391240

76804,comment,76792,76792,0,0,shayan,,,"I think this is a valid and interesting question, and I hope we get some useful answers here.. but I personally think the market structure is also important, i.e how saturated it is and what not... <p>also if you know how big your market is I believe to some extend you can think of how much of a market share you can get, and with those two you can obviously estimate how much your company would be worth (on a good day).  
If your question is to know how much money you can raise, the estimated value of the company will obviously help you a lot.  If the market is worth $100M and you will only have a percentage of that market, I doubt you would be able to raise millions of dollars from the VC's, and if you do, you are probably looking to give up a lot of shares.<p>But if there is a ""rule of thumb"" I would like to hear it too",1194391068

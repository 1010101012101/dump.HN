10897371,comment,10892660,10896291,0,0,gwern,,,"> In general, I cannot understand why people continue to use frequentist methods on policy problems -- that is, problems where you are inherently looking for Pr(Hypothesis | Data), and where, due to all of the many, many pitfalls from the above sources and elsewhere, you can be sure that Pr(Data | Hypothesis) is not at all a suitable proxy for Pr(Hypothesis | Data).<p>To some extent, this is inherent to the application of the tools. In an A/B test, done by a business, it is incomplete to apply &#x27;just&#x27; a frequentist hypothesis test (whether or not you fall into any of the traps) or just a Bayesian test with a relatively arbitrary threshold like 99% probability of improvement. As has been pointed out many times, your standard A/B test is focused solely on precisely whether there is an effect or not, while ignoring all the costs and benefits; which means you get precise expensive estimates of the wrong thing. You need to broaden the picture and explicitly acknowledge that it&#x27;s a <i>decision theory</i> problem and this is why multi-armed bandits are the right framework for A/B testing.<p>Unfortunately, it takes so much time and effort to understand all the statistical material about testing and power and binomials and whatnot that anything to do with decision theory tends to be relegated to advanced courses or later textbook chapters, if people ever hear of decision theory (or reinforcement learning, or sequential trials, or multi-armed bandits) at all. You might consider decision theory to be the flower of statistics, in which all the cookbooks and algorithms reach their justifications and you know when you can break the various rules of thumb you&#x27;ve learned, but it requires so much time to teach the biology of plants that few students get there or are still interested.<p>I&#x27;m trying to consolidate decision theory materials at <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/DecisionTheory/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/DecisionTheory/</a> (submitted at <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10897324"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10897324</a> ) if you want to read up more on this topic.",1452718124

The solution is simple enough that most people understand it instantly: person A divides the cake into two portions however they please, and person B then selects one of those portions, A receiving the other. Everyone will agree that this is intuitively fair. But it&#x27;s certainly <i>not</i> fair for either of the two reasons I dispute -- A might still envy the portion of the cake that went to B, imagining a different world where the entire cake was theirs... or A might slip up with the knife and create one portion which is obviously better than the other portion, which B then chooses.<p>Rather, I think the benefits of envy-free division come from two other points:<p>- The parties involved agree beforehand that the process is fair. This requires them to be able to understand it, which is easy for the two-person division and quite difficult for more than two.<p>- Instead of assuming that division goes off without a hitch, we can observe that if you receive a portion you&#x27;re unhappy with, it&#x27;s because <i>you messed up</i>.

In order for it to be worth $930M in present value, the assumed rate of return can only be about 3.7%.  If you have even a bare inkling that you can invest at a rate better than 3.7%, you should take the lump sum.  For reference purposes, the worst historic 30-year rolling rate of return on a S&P500 index fund is 8%, for a period including the entire Great Depression.  Mostly, people get at least 10% over that span of time.<p>Accounting for federal taxes, which I assume to be 39.6% for a sum that large, the lump sum winner takes $930M and keeps $562M.  For tax reasons, you arrange for your ordinary annual income from the low-risk investments to be $400k, on which you pay $116k in tax, and spend $284k.  So you set aside $13.3M at 3% for this.  With the remaining $549M, you invest at an average 10% over 29 years, occasionally paying 15% long-term capital gains tax, to get $5850M.<p>The annuity winner pays $19.8M in income tax every year, resulting in a net annual payment of $30.2M.  If you subtract $284k as expenses, and invest the rest at 10% with occasional 20% long-term capital gains tax (the tax reason from the previous paragraph), you end up with $3390M after 29 years.  This is almost 7 years behind the lump sum investor.<p>Conclusion: take the lump sum payment.",1452716354

First, it does not expose Chakra’s private bindings to the browser or the Universal Windows Platform, both of which constrain it to a very specific use case scenario. Second, instead of exposing the COM based diagnostic APIs that are currently available in Chakra, ChakraCore will support a new set of JSON based diagnostic APIs, which are platform agnostic and could be standardized or made interoperable across different implementations in the long run.

Quite often pieces by guest writers are published too, but usually still under one of these themes.<p>Quite often they&#x27;ll publish a series of articles, diving into one topic, or write an article as a response to reader feedback (one example being the Operation Easy Chair, which they also published in English and as an eBook: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10789987"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10789987</a>).<p>So far they seem to be doing pretty well, which is amazing considering that it&#x27;s (almost) entirely in Dutch, and entirely reader-supported. I think they&#x27;re working on an English version as well.<p>One could argue that it only works because their audience mostly consists of educated readers with a decent income, but I&#x27;d argue that &#x27;non-educated&#x27; readers would often be better of with little to no news instead of the crap they&#x27;re presented with through the low-quality papers. And if demand for such news is large enough, people will end up willing to pay for it when it&#x27;s gone. Finally, there&#x27;s acceptable news coverage provided on public broadcast as well.<p>This will suck for many journalists, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the decent ones will be happy with whatever alternatives pop up. Most decent journalists I know are miserable at the papers they work for, for various reasons. The Wire&#x27;s last season, while perhaps a bit too slanted against mainstream newspapers, does a pretty decent job outlining many of the problems.",1452715700

It’s information, and we know how to build \n  computers that process information.\n</code></pre>\nThe fundamental error here is trying to explain <i>consciousness</i> through the concept of <i>information</i>. The thing is, <i>information</i> can&#x27;t be explained except by reference to consciousness. A physical entity X (e.g., a radio signal) might hold information for a conscious agent Y, but X doesn&#x27;t intrinsically hold information in the absence of an agent.<p>I know there&#x27;s a growing trend in modern physics to treat information as a real physical property, akin to matter or energy, but I hold that this is a category error, akin to treating &quot;risk&quot; as something you measure in the world, rather than a measurement of your own uncertainty about a situation. They&#x27;re both examples of the Mind Projection Fallacy, projecting properties properly belonging to the mind out into the world.<p>Dualism gets a bad rap, but you can posit a non-religious form of dualism, whereby matter & consciousness are both natural elements of the universe, but possessing different properties. Perhaps future science will be able to explain their relationship in more detail.<p>Attempting to dismiss consciousness, on the other hand, by taking monist reductionism as axiomatic (everything is matter, consciousness isn&#x27;t real), end up with the proponents attributing properties of consciousness to matter, and ultimately flopping back over into monist idealism (everything is consciousness) and precisely the mysticism they were trying to avoid.",1452715661

There are things that _have to_ use Windows (Azure AD, MS SQL, Exchange, Sharepoint), but everything else is only harmed by it. So the litmus test is going to be whether they actually move their major backend systems to Linux in the coming 2-3 years.

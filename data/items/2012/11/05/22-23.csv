So it would be important to make sure it's not in plain-text. And of course if Chad wants to do that, he can easily build a rainbow file, but he can make it easier for himself by just lying about storing the ips.\nNow another problem with this approach, would be the ability to change the salt. The moment it's changed, all data is lost (or meaningless). So in order to make it secure, it would be very very long, and unpredictable. Also encrypted.\nAnother thing, if an attacker would access the server where the code is running, if it's in the memory he would get it. So when it's in memory, it should only reside there when it's being used, and destroyed immediately. So it makes it harder to the attacker to get it, (until the moment it's used).\nBut come to think of it, if the attacker is that good, I think he would be interested in other things, like things that would get him more money than a list of IP addresses. :-)",1352156254

4746276,comment,4744544,4744544,3,0,fjorder,,,"As Neil Young put it, ""Piracy is the new radio"".<p>A pirate torrent site providing promotion for artists at the artists' request is not something new.  Private music torrent trackers have been doing this for several years now.<p>For example, take Anamanaguchi (a NY based band).  Their 2009 album, ""Dawn Metropolis"" was featured, at Anamanaguchi's request, on Waffles and soon became the #1 most downloaded album on that tracker.  A year later Anamanaguchi was cutting the soundtrack for Scott Pilgrim vs the World.  Yes, this kind of promotion <i>really</i> works.<p>What scares the big record labels is not that piracy is the new radio, but that <i>they don't control it</i>.  It becomes very difficult to predict what will become successful if music trends are left to arise organically from the listeners themselves rather than board-room focus groups.  A lack of predictability is bad for an industry that is in the habit of throwing millions of promotion dollars behind artists in order to manufacture success.  If the labels can't predict the trends, how do they know which horses to back?  While theft of music is certainly an issue, I think it's of secondary concern to labels.  It's the unpredictability that piracy is injecting into popular music that is really going to mess up their business.",1352156220

We sometimes describe ourselves as a ""mobile analytics backend as a service"", although that is kind of an awkward mouthful.<p>Our target customers are mobile developers who would otherwise need to roll their own analytics infrastructure for their apps. Generally people build their own analytics backends because other tools on the market don't provide an easy way to get data back out. That makes it hard to build analytics into custom interfaces or do data analysis across other areas of your business, for example. We provide full export and expose analytics via API.<p>We are trying to make our product extremely developer-friendly and make it as easy as possible to get data and metrics in and out of Keen IO so that people can do whatever they want with their data. For example, you could build a tab in your iPhone app that displays your custom event data metrics.<p>Hope that makes sense. We welcome any feedback you might have for our startup :)",1352155190

Since you only need to do key-value lookups, there are many (easy) approaches, that can scale better than MySQL. You could do JSON files on a filesystem (with some nesting, as you don't want to put 20 million files in 1 dir). Or Redis: 20 million x 1 KB is 20 GB. You will need more with overhead, but a few machines would work. Or Riak (we went > 1 billion items with Riak).\nBut even MySQL should be able to handle this: We had over 100 million records in MySQL (on SSD's) before switching to something else.<p>That seems to be the quickest win to reduce the number of requests, but it will depend on the overlap of your usersets how much this will help.",1352155161

The combination of enterprise customers with special needs would fork out $$$ for special-needs units.  This actually did happen -- look at pictures of the NYSE trading floor from the time. People with a lot of money (and more to be made) underwrote secial-use tablets (complete with wireless 28.8 modems, etc)<p>Today, an iPad likely does not need modification to do most tasks, that were the placeholders discussed in the 1990's. It would have to be 10x better than the iPad, to be compelling to a vertical market player today.  But, I don't think there is an order of magnitude opportunity on the sidewalk.  The main constrains seem to be power/weight.  As soon as you get to 2x Ipad4 you are looking at something like an 11-in MBAir, but that's already on the market for 1.5x the iPad cost.<p>So a speciailst unit would need to be something like the size of the iPad mini but with the power of a MB air.  All in some kind of form factor (hardened/waterproof/secure) that was unique to a specialist application. I do think there are opportunities for that, but I'm inclined to think AAPL might be better to have a go at them.  They would need an OSX competitive operating system, something like 512GB of flash memory, and some unique specialist application SW to be written.<p>That seems like a lot for a new entrant to pursue, and its unlear the market is large enough for a new entrant.

I have tried to inquire about it in my past (I'm 23 now) and every attempt to even discuss it with people that are otherwise open to discussion about most anything (e.g. Planned Parenthood) have been stonewalled.<p>I haven't seriously considered it and was approaching it more from a curiosity point of view, but the reaction I got was mindblowing. You are pretty much interrogated about and judged on why you're asking about it even if the doctor has no intention to perform any such procedure on you (""it's for your own good""), and sometimes it doesn't even matter that you already have kids. One of my friends has even gone to multiple doctors to find one that would tie her tubes despite having 3 kids in a marriage going on 15 years and problems with most forms of birth control. (I have no idea how men fare in this regard.)<p>The other unfortunate thing is that there's still no 100% effectiveness with almost all methods of sterilization: worst case it's no better than near perfect use of the pill, best case it's just slightly better than IUDs/implants - it's a matter of arguing whether one or a couple of 9s go after 99%. The only real benefit is that it's a do-it-once-and-forget type of thing as well as something men can do, unlike IUDs that need replaced every x years or similar that are only for women.<p>And my 2c to politics: I don't think abortion is an edge case as it ties into a greater freedom of reproductive choice for women that make up half the US population before we even get started on how this affects their partners and families. Obama is not incorrect in saying that this is an economic and also crucial issue, as even everyday things like easy access to birth control (one less stressor for me and my partner! thank you!) are being assaulted by the super far extremist right. How serious they are shall remain to be seen (and on a state level it seems pretty serious), but as a woman I am scared shitless by the idea that a presidential candidate is included in that group of people.<p>This is not to say that SOPA and many, many other issues aren't also important, but absolute single-issue voting doesn't help anyone in any regard because there are plenty of non-tested, extremist, and pointlessly single minded people that support SOPA. There just is no such thing as a candidate that represents everything I care about the way I want, so I choose the one that I feel will do the least damage across more issues.",1352154219

Renewable power has problems doing this which creates demand for energy storage.<p>Many powerplants such as Nuclear or Coal can take hours to startup and shutdown.  The power markets and grid management orgs spend a lot of time scheduling power production and balancing supply and demand.  Plants tell grid operators, we're running from 2-6pm on Tuesday - and face fines if the power isn't delivered.  Some plants get paid to be on ""standby"" to deal with surges in demand.<p>The price of power can at times become negative, because for some plants it is cheaper for the operator to get zero or even negative revenue for a short period vs. shutting down.  Wind power Tax credits and carbon offsets at times mean windfarms can make money with a negative powerprice.<p>Wind power can have problems meshing with the grid and scheduling/dispach of power.  If you're producing power when you're not scheduled and demand is low the price a plant gets can be very low, even negative, because it isn't needed.  Part of this is because of market rules, and part of it is actual operations.<p><pre><code>  So if the wind is blowing during a period of time that people are not using much power the windfarm operator makes very little or nothing.  If you can store energy for even a few hours it can be moved from periods of low demand to high demand which makes a lot of money and ensures you are not fined for failure to deliver power.    \n</code></pre>\nThe big economic impact here is that there are a lot of powerplants called peakers that only run durring periods of peak demand.  Peakers tend to be the least efficent plants out there because they are run so little, like burning 1.5-2 times more natural gas per unit of output.  If you can store energy then you can build efficent power plants that produce all the time and use a lot less fuel.<p>Yes, I was an Energy Economist and part of the Enron Power Trading desk years ago.",1352153912

4746070,comment,4738587,4738587,2,0,chubbard,,,"Man this article has created all sorts of strange discussions.  I've watched in on G+, Facebook and now here, and eventually they get soooo derailed talking about odd ball stuff not really related.  I guess this means Mr. Christensen is onto something stirring up this much discussion.<p>One thing is common among all of the discussions which is the fixation on the tax proposal, but I think it was just a swag at what a policy might look like.  I thought the real interesting part of his observation is that we are rewarding efficiency innovation too much and transformative innovation almost nothing.  Try and develop a new power system not based on fossil fuels and see how much money people want to give you when your time horizon is 10-20 years out.  It is the transformative innovation that recreates jobs for the jobs lost through efficiency innovation.  I think that is the more important discussion over a regressive capital gain tax.  Remember, most entrepreneurship would qualify for preferential capital gains taxation (except for ISO options oddly) because even the efficiency innovation takes more than 1 year to payback.<p>His tax would mostly affect wall street and the trader mentality: HFT, ETFs, day traders, etc.  Remember people buying or selling securities don't actually give companies money directly.  Companies only get more money when the issue more shares (or hold their own shares).  If I buy a share for 1 day or 10 years the company doesn't benefit at all from my action.<p>If you look at the green energy movement a few years back was going to be very transformative, but VCs backed off when it was hard to turn a profit as quickly as information technology.  It's that kinda of calculus that needs changing if we really want to do what Christensen is outlining.",1352153254

4746062,comment,4744544,4744800,1,0,jacquesm,,,"> Competition with lower price is not good for business.<p>It's not that simple. Competition with lower price points can drive innovation and reduce costs and hence can lead to an increase in volume that more than makes up for the reduced prices.<p>In the case of digital music with a potential market of 100's of millions of consumers and a baseline of anywhere between 10K and 200K for a professionally produced piece of music it could very well be more profitable to sell your content to a much larger audience at $0.30 than to a smaller one at $.99 Without competition people would get stuck at unrealistically high price-points and we'd all be that much poorer (culturally) for that. Musique pour supermarch is a nice example of how far you could push that. It made a fraction of what it would have made if it were released.<p>Competition driving lower prices would unlock a much larger market. Of course from a monopoly position such competition always looks bad, especially if you can squeeze both the consumer <i>and</i> the producer.<p>This mechanism doesn't hold forever, here is a lower boundary where you will no longer be making more profits and that sweet spot is the point where most of all the sellers will congregate. Given that the cost of distribution is negligible (music tends to spread for free) you'd need a way to piggy-back onto the music being played rather than the music being transferred to side-step the issues of piracy.",1352153132

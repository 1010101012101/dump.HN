It wasn't until a year after my statistics course that I realised its importance..<p>I used statistics in a uni project to analyse audio data to perform event detection. The goal of my part of the project was to determine the most optimal balance between accuracy of event detection and power consumption (it was to be run on embedded hardware). I wrote some tools which gave different statistical data of an audio clip, which we could then use to determine a power-efficient, yet accurate, algorithm to do real time event detection. The program gave such data as root mean square of the audio clip, its skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation and a bunch more, as well as combinations of these (and graphed them visually, superimposed on the sound wave).<p>That was my first hands-on intro to statistics. Other things I've encountered since then is statistical clustering for the purpose of data classification and pattern matching, statistical analysis of text for spam detection and other such things.<p>I wish I'd payed more attention in class as I find statistics to be one of the more useful things which I <i>didnt</i> learn.. though I bought an intro book on statistics recently and am working my way through it, hopefully learning what I missed.<p>The problem with my course was that it wasn't very hands on. It was too abstract, so it was difficult to see the value in it and therefore easy to neglect. The thing is, though, that a lot of technology we use every day relies on statistics. If I can give you any advice, it would be to force yourself to do well in statistics - it'll pay off in the long run.",1252071584

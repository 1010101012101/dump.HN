The Erlang community is also incredibly practical. I enjoy programming languages that are born out of research, such as Rust and others, but I really enjoy Erlang because it was born out of solving a problem. We&#x27;re very fortunate that the problem Erlang creators were trying to solve back in the 80s and 90s is a pretty common problem today.<p>It&#x27;s easy to get hung up at the aesthetics of Erlang. But the parts that really change you as a programmer are the ideals that Erlang embodies. I urge you to continue on, or learn Erlang by way of Elixir.",1413554380

8470971,comment,8470125,8470792,0,0,mattmanser,,,"My opinion is that it&#x27;s <i>very</i>, <i>very</i> hard to avoid this.<p>I would say that in all the software I have ever written, some part of it sucked. It&#x27;s actually quite upsetting if I think too hard about it, I wish it wasn&#x27;t that way. This is mainly because of four reasons (in no particular order):<p>1. I didn&#x27;t have time to really finish it<p>2. I didn&#x27;t test it thoroughly enough<p>3. There was some part of the underlying language or framework that I was unaware of that behaves unexpectedly (e.g. the framework encodes output, the int in the language can only handle up to 16384, or you can add a general error catcher, but if you invoke a web method in a particular way, the framework &#x27;helpfully&#x27; circumvents the error handler, leading to weird bug that you never hear about)<p>4. I was using a new language/framework that I didn&#x27;t know quite how to use. It&#x27;s not just inexperience, quite often the examples for new frameworks/languages turn out to be bad practices or inefficient ways of doing things in the long run.<p>Even if you&#x27;re a good programmer and try and plan ahead, quite often you&#x27;re writing something you don&#x27;t quite understand until you actually write it and as you go you make, in hindsight, a couple of poor decisions. It&#x27;s often a big job to go back and change those poor decisions, and even if you did it might not completely fix the problem. Some remnants of the old design stick around like a bad smell.<p>And there&#x27;s also bad design decisions that don&#x27;t come out until the program is out in the wild, you might have thought the purpose of your wheel was to make bicycles, but in fact only a couple of neckbeards make bicycles, everyone else is making cars out of them and they&#x27;re completely the wrong design.<p>And worse, only the neckbeards are on the mailing list so you get a disproportionate amount of feedback from a vocal minority and don&#x27;t even realise it&#x27;s not really suitable.<p>And on top of that, some software suffers from the first mover advantage though it&#x27;s badly written and then gets almost, but not quite, abandoned, so no-one ever moves to the much better alternatives.<p>And then all those little warts and mistakes, as you say, propagate.<p>I have screamed at my screen in rage at how <i>stupid</i> some programmer has been while designing a program that almost does what I want but quite spectacularly (or worse silently) fails at some key part. But they probably tried hard to make it good.<p>In truth, writing excellent software is still the domain of a very elite few, the rest of us write ok, but very brittle, software.<p>EDIT: Added reason 4",1413554200
8470970,comment,8467772,8470907,0,0,kibwen,,,"I&#x27;d love to compile such a thing, but doing it properly would involve both cataloguing every change <i>and</i> recording the rationale for each. And because the rationale for changes is so dependent on the context of the-language-as-it-was-at-that-moment-in-time, random access of the archive would leave your understanding incomplete. For example, I just said that we removed `Either` because nobody was using it and because it was structurally a complete duplicate of `Result`... but I omitted the fact that `Result` was almost universally shunned at the time as well, in favor of `Option`. :P<p>Part of me wonders if the best way to do it wouldn&#x27;t be to to start at Rust 1.0 and go on a tour backwards through history, i.e. &quot;here&#x27;s a great language, now let&#x27;s all make terrible decisions to make it worse!&quot; :)",1413554189

8470962,comment,8470206,8470206,0,0,aaron42net,,,"We&#x27;re moving all of production in EC2 from an old CentOS 5 image managed by capistrano to CoreOS, with fleet deploying images built by the docker.io build service and private repo. I love it.<p>Every week, we rebuild our base image starting with the latest debian:stable image, apply updates, and then our apps are built off of the latest base image.  So distro security updates are automatically included with our next deploy.<p>We had been deploying multiple apps to the same EC2 instances. Having each app&#x27;s dependencies be separate from other apps has made upgrading them easier already.<p>This also means all containers are ephemeral and are guaranteed to be exactly the same, which is a pretty big change from our use of capistrano in practice.  I&#x27;m hoping this saves us a lot of debugging hassle.<p>Instead of using ELBs internally, I&#x27;m using registrator to register the dynamic ports of all of my running services across the cluster in etcd, with confd creating a new template for NginX and updating it within 5 seconds if a service comes up or drops out.  Apps only need to talk to their local NginX (running everywhere) to find a load-balanced pool of whichever service they are looking for.  NginX is better than ELB at logging and retrying failed requests, to provide a better user-experience during things like deploys.<p>Some of these things could be solved by spinning up more EC2 instances.  However that usually takes minutes, where docker containers take seconds, which changes the experience dramatically.<p>And I&#x27;m actually reducing my spend by being able to consolidate more.  I can say things like &quot;I want one instance of this unit running somewhere in the cluster&quot; rather than having a standalone EC2 instance for it.",1413554089

So I wonder if it&#x27;s just being made more complicated than it really needs to be, the same way GUI libraries always are. GUI libraries are generally terrible, but this is self-perpetuating as people making new GUI libs absorb bad assumptions from the old ones. There&#x27;s an interview up with a Mir developer who mentions Mir is structured as communication via a protocol over sockets. And, like, I have literally NO IDEA why you would build a window system like that in 2014. It makes no sense to me at all. (But if you do decide that&#x27;s how things should go, things become a lot more complicated, so that&#x27;s at least part of the problem.)<p>A major reason computers are so unreliable and un-fun to use is because software is now a massive pile of overcomplication. When it comes to a core thing like a window system, that many programs will interface with, simplicity should be a high design priority. Because every bit of complication that goes into the window system propagates. EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM becomes more complicated. Every piece of software becomes harder to develop. The toll in man-years becomes HUGE very quickly. Yet for some reason people don&#x27;t learn. I think there is some Stockholm Syndrome happening: programmers can&#x27;t even imagine how much more they would get done if the underlying systems were as simple, reasonable and solid as they should be.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m curious about HN&#x27;s opinion on this.",1413552271

It would be nice if Apple included system fonts and other UI elements adapted specifically for such a 1:3 ratio of virtual size to actual size, which we might call &quot;pixel tripling&quot; in contrast to the &quot;pixel doubling&quot; that Apple has already implemented (a.k.a., HiDPI mode) in which each virtual pixel is made up of a square of 4 actual pixels.<p>Apple is very unlikely to go through the trouble of implementing &quot;pixel tripling&quot; just to accommodate people like you and me, but wouldn&#x27;t it be sweet? :)<p>[1]: A rectangle 1706 pixels by 960 pixels contains .93 as many pixels as one 1680 by 1050 contains.",1413551246

Let&#x27;s revisit this:<p><pre><code>   &#x27;but while it is hard to generalize, there is a strong \n   tendency&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nI went out of my way not to generalize. I stated a tendency. There is no hard and fast rule here.<p><pre><code>   &#x27;The truth is that most muslim women in Germany, \n   especially the Turkish ones, don&#x27;t even wear a \n   headscarf.&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nI did not mention headscarves. Not once. I stated &#x27;misogyny&#x27;. The two are not the same.<p><pre><code>   &#x27;I almost never hear &quot;Multikulti&quot; except from extreme \n   right-wing people, and those who share racist opinions,\n   but don&#x27;t consider themselves Racist.&#x27;\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Multikulti&quot; was a concept was popularized by the liberal Alliance 90/Green Party. Merkel, of the right leaning CDU stated multi-cuturalism has &quot;utterly failed&quot; back in 2010 [1]. This is a partisan concept. I therefore struggle to see how you can associate the attempt by the German people to have a multi-cultural society as racist. I don&#x27;t understand how you make that connection?<p><pre><code>   &#x27;There is a well documented effect in that the teacher&#x27;s\n   expectations are reflected both in subjective grades and\n   objective performance.&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nThat I agree with.<p><pre><code>   &#x27;Another confusing factor is that most Turkish \n   &quot;immigrant&quot; children are anything but immigrants. Their \n   parents or grandparents immigrated to Germany decades ago\n   and helped build the country.&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nAgreed, these children come from a migration background. I should have made that clearer. My observation was that specifically the boys have a problem with women teachers telling them what to do. This includes female teachers that come from a &quot;Migrationshintergrund&quot;. Women having a position of authority over these boys is a problem for them.<p><pre><code>  &#x27;pin this complex problem on a mysterious genetic factor\n  that makes Turks dumber&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nThis one baffles me. I stated that these boys have a discipline problem. I also stated that these children are not achieving their potential because of the misogyny, <i>not</i> because they are dumb.<p>Bottom line is that a misogynistic cultural attitude is prevalent in Turkish society. That misogyny concerns the role of women in the work place. It especially causes problems in schools where women teachers hold positions of authority over young men who do not like, and are not used to, that scenario. As a result come discipline problems that (as you so eloquently put it) &#x27;the teacher&#x27;s expectations are reflected both in subjective grades and objective performance&#x27; results.<p>It is a vicious cycle. Hence, I went out of my way to state that both sides are to blame. You appear to have overlooked that fact.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11559451"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11559451</a>",1413550886

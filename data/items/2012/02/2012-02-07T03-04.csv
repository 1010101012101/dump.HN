The product I worked on was written mostly in C++, but we weren't allowed to use the STL. The reason was that the early versions of the product were written before the STL was stable across all platforms used at the company* (which included things like IBM AIX, HP-PA, etc.). So the original developers (back in the late '90s) wrote a number of container class templates that were used instead. Of course, once those were in place, you had to keep using them, as mixing STL and non-STL containers would have been a maintenance nightmare.<p>I would suspect there's a lot of old C++ software that falls into this category.

Some get traction, some don't.  Many successful ones are companies you may have never heard of because they sell custom versions to government agencies instead of marketing them directly to end-users.<p>I had launched a website similar to RideJoy 4 years ago, although I gave up on it before getting as far as they are now since mine didn't get much traction.  I even returned Craigslist postings in my search engine similar to what RideJoy does.<p>I came to realize that with all of the ridesharing systems out there, we really should start working together to keep the userbase from fracturing into too many systems.  Any useful rideshare system requires a critical mass for it to be useful, and I worried that having too many websites, each separated on their own island, would divide up the userbase by too much.<p>The answer to this: Share data between services, or otherwise aggregate searches on multiple services.  If we did this, then it wouldn't matter how many new rideshare websites launched as we'd still be able to search the aggregate of trips posted instead of dividing up the pie even further.<p>A few years ago I invited people from the rideshare industry, then developed and evangelized OpenTrip, a common data exchange protocol for sharing rideshare trips among the various systems.<p>I had some backing from a government agency at first.  Unfortunately, this too didn't end up taking off.  Perhaps I was too much of an idealist to think ""open sourcing"" carpooling could take off.<p>I am happy to see new interest in this with RideJoy.  I hope you guys are successful.

""Stupid"" and ""idiot"" aren't precise words, so we shouldn't build arguments around ""ideal developers"" who use ""ideal language."" Helps no one.<p>One could easily write a follow-up, ""What Designers' Really Mean When They Cry 'Stupid!'""

That is, ""stupid clients are stupid."" I want the client to respect their role as a client. For points like ""graphic design,"" it should be handled in the contract, to some degree, how to deal with creative freedom and UI decisions. The client has input: most developers give their clients input. It's when the client realizes they have input but are unsure of the scope of it: (1) because they're not hired to do review wireframes, etc to produce a holistic picture (they're the client) and (2) they're trained at being untrained critics (meaning, as a designer, e.g., one trains or practices at being a trained critic: a client is hiring _that_: so, I assert the stupidity of the client when the client lacks the sense to understand _what it is they've purchased_ by hiring me).",1328585490

Connecting bands to bands?<p>Personally, I've seen a lot more musicians switching from myspace to bandcamp than facebook or soundcloud (though I think soundcloud has gotten a lot more traction in more electronic scenes). Last time I tried was a few months back but the interface in facebook was simply terrible for posting music.<p>I think that tightly combining social and music is not really so important. Bandcamp provides a beautiful and easy way to present, give away, and even sell your music. You get a professional URL to your work with only a tiny bandcamp footer which can be shared (organically and via like buttons, etc). In some ways, combining bandcamp and facebook/twitter is the unix philosophy in action.",1328583957

Since they have listings for each version of OS X, I decided to take a look at how much software they were using that was only available under the GNU public license. The results are illuminating:<p>10.5: 47 GPL-licensed packages.\n10.6: 44 GPL-licensed packages.\n10.7: 29 GPL-licensed packages.\nThis clearly supports the idea that Apple is aggressively trying to remove all GPL-licensed software from OS X. While the removal of Samba and GCC got some attention, the numbers show that there’s a more general purging going on.<p>The 29 remaining GPL-licensed packages aren’t too healthy either. Lion apparently ships with bash 3.2. That’s from 2006. The current version is 4.2.10. Why no upgrade? Because Apple’s shipping the last version of bash that was under the GPL version 2.<p>The message is pretty obvious: Apple won’t ship anything that’s licensed under GPL v3 on OS X. Now, why is that?<p>There are two big changes in GPL v3. The first is that it explicitly prohibits patent lawsuits against people for actually using the GPL-licensed software you ship. The second is that it carefully prevents TiVoization, locking down hardware so that people can’t actually run the software they want.<p>So, which of those things are they planning for OS X, eh?<p>I’m also intrigued to see how far they are prepared to go with this. They already annoyed and inconvenienced a lot of people with the Samba and GCC removal. Having wooed so many developers to the Mac in the last decade, are they really prepared to throw away all that goodwill by shipping obsolete tools and making it a pain in the ass to upgrade them?",1328583773

10286341,comment,10285337,10285337,0,0,daniel-levin,,,"I agree with the premise that it is destructive for students to merely learn tricks in order to pass classes.<p>However, the existence of tricks is enormously useful once understanding the underlying mechanism of a particular tool is not the focus of a problem at hand. Abstraction is a fundamental human cognitive faculty. For instance, if a student understands why the cross-multiplication &#x27;trick&#x27; works, then they should be free to use it as they please, provided they can actually explain why it works if prompted to do so. The notion that there was a &#x27;right&#x27; way to do something (like use common denominators) was stifling and frustrating during my school years. If I can explain and justify the trick - then let me use it. On the other hand, being boxed into doing things the instructor-sanctioned way can lead to equally vacuous understanding: &quot;Teacher says find a common denominator so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do even though I don&#x27;t know why&quot;.<p>Additionally, I will argue that <i>all</i> methods for doing computations with fractions are &#x27;tricks&#x27; at some level. After all, they are just theorems on the field of quotients of the integers embedded in the reals. One should not be precluded from using a &#x27;trick&#x27; because one of these theorems (&#x27;common denominator method good - your trick bad&#x27;) is more familiar to an instructor. Replacing one &#x27;trick&#x27; with what is <i>actually just another</i> does not facilitate understanding.<p>Of course, this is predicated on actually understanding the tool in the first place.<p>I take an opposite viewpoint from the author(s). Students should be encouraged to develop and use tools. The utility of hiding complexity [0] with tooling is part of the very essence of what it means to be a hacker. It is also very useful in other fields. For example, a physicist solving for the flow of some fluid does not need to think about why a particular fraction trick works. This would draw precious cognitive resources better served elsewhere.<p>Once a concept is understood, tricks become useful tools. In a field such as building construction, short-cuts are often expensive in the long run because the benefit of making some compromise (e.g. use cheap plaster) is outweighed by its consequences (e.g. need to re-plaster after short amount of time). This mode of thinking does not apply to mathematics.<p>Tricks are not &#x27;bad&#x27; and should not be nixed. They should be embraced and presented as tools of great utility.<p>[0] Such as how fractions work<p>edit: spelling",1443358486

I think a lot of these tricks were a result of George Bush II&#x27;s &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; testing mandate (2002? around there), where test results directly correlated to the amount of federal funding you&#x27;d receive. In response, teachers adopted quick tricks in order to optimize for test performance (i.e. &#x27;teach for the test&#x27;). I&#x27;d wager these &quot;tricks&quot; are what teachers are forced to use to cater to effectively get the average student to perform optimally on those standardized tests. People just now entering their undergraduate programs, I speculate, will be familiar with these shortcuts.<p>Math is taught in a wide variety of ways, depending on where you live, what type of schools you&#x27;re going to (private east-coast Andover/Exeter vs inner-city Chicago), how rich your city is (higher taxes => more money for schools => safer/better environments => fosters a better learning experience & a life at home that values rigorous grasp of academic concepts), etc.<p>I was one of those lucky guys to grow up in an environment that had a heavy emphasis on academia at the &#x27;publish or perish (then tenure)&#x27; level and my school systems emphasized concepts over rote memorization (i.e., a course on geometric proof formulation where you are given a set of axioms from which you must derive all consequential Lemmas, which is basically the opposite of &#x27;heres a few tricks&#x27;),<p>If your class size is 35, and you have even one or two disruptive kids in class I&#x27;d imagine even the most dedicated teachers would start &#x27;teaching by the tricks, for the test&#x27;.<p>To answer your question: America is a big place. The difference between most Euro countries is culturally less than the difference between NYC and Harlan, Kentucky.<p>An interesting corollary of this is (let&#x27;s choose to ignore ethical implications here -- I believe everyone has the right to free, high quality education, housing, and food), but purely from the POV of workplace-competition-over-jobs, the more schools continue to teach poor analytic skills, the less competent my competitors are.

A lot of the backlash against Common Core Mathematics is from people who want Mathematics education to stay that way.<p>The reason is that a huge amount of mathematics educators in American secondary schools aren&#x27;t properly trained in even elementary Mathematics.<p>At the lower grades (ages < 15 or 16) it&#x27;s mostly because you can go through all of high school and university in America without understanding anything about Mathematics. For example, most people at the university I attended never took a Calculus course. Everyone was required to take a Mathematics course, but there are math courses that are essentially repeats of what you would expect a non-exceptional sixth grader to understand -- matching linear functions to their graphs and the like. These courses even get recommended by teaching colleges because even Calculus I was perceived as &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;advanced&quot; &quot;math&quot;. And Calculus I itself was entirely superficial and mostly trick-based (because calculus isn&#x27;t proof based except at a tiny handful of elite universities).<p>Result: most Mathematics educators a typical student encounters before the age of 15 have never written a proof (with practical consequences; e.g., they don&#x27;t know what induction is). Even worse, these educators would probably have a hard time defining a function in terms that a working mathematician would find meaningful (educators now have their own cutesy but non-rigorous definitions for things like &quot;number&quot; and &quot;function&quot;).<p>At the upper ages (~15 until university), I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s because teachers are not properly compensated and so teaching doesn&#x27;t appeal to the best students. Many high school teachers that teach math at least complete an undergraduate degree in Mathematics, although even that is not actually required in many states. However, based upon my anecdotal experience tutoring and interacting with peers while in university, Education students are typically in the bottom half of Mathematics students and often rely on (and prefer :-( ) &quot;trick&quot;-based &quot;mathematics&quot;, even in proof-based courses (memorizing formats of theorems and corresponding proofs, then figuring out what symbols/numbers to plug in. But with zero understanding of the underlying argument).",1443356646

A second fixed up version (something like Ceylon) could be mixed in with old Java code. Just change the suffix to .java2 to signify a class using the new language spec.<p>In my opinion basic type inference, name parameters, better support for immutability* and multiline strings represent the majority of the deficit in terms of making java more expressive and convenient. Other things such as higher order functions (would require an extension of the type system) raise issues that make the benefits less clear cut.<p>* my view on immutability is that it should be possible to 'bake' a class or an interface. So it can be manipulated before being made immutable.<p>(Apparently something like this is possible in Java 6 using annotations and compiler plugin extensions, but apparently it is not straight forwards to get working with IDEs (and as such, given the importance of IDEs one may as well change language).",1302680253

But here's what works for me:<p>* Cramming/putting stuff off to the last minute helps with motivation.  I did it too much and burned out.  Find the right balance.<p>* Oftentimes I find that lectures are a really inefficient way to learn stuff.  For example, in one class I can get through the slides of a 90-minute lecture in 45 minutes on my own, have more fun, and understand better.  The key is actually getting myself to do this.  Also, it's important to have a timer and glance at it frequently to make sure I'm keeping a 45-minute pace.<p>* Use triggers and condition yourself to concentrate on the triggers.  For me it's original-flavor Trident gum + rainymood.com + somafm.com/play/groovesalad.<p>* I generally work in cycles: 50 minutes of work followed by a 10-minute break where I change my scenery and daydream.  I rarely try to make myself work when I'm seriously not in the mood, as I don't get much done and I create a negative association.  I don't hesitate to take much longer breaks if my morale or energy are really low.<p>* Every evening, I plan out the next day and have a rough idea of what I'm going to be doing at any given time.  I generally don't follow my plan very well, but having a specific thing that I'm supposed to be doing seems to lower my activation energy for tuning out distraction.  I use cron to open a tab in my browser reminding myself to make a plan, and I stick my tongue out until it's done.<p>* I'm pretty good at sleeping 8 hours a night.  I think this helps me because it increases the portion of my days on which I feel energetic.<p>* Studying with other students always helps with motivation.<p>Why are you taking so many classes?  At my university you need special permission to take more than 5 or so.<p>This site is probably good for more advice: <a href=""http://calnewport.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calnewport.com/blog/</a>",1302680245

Rather, it is a list of facts.<p>It's not about me WILLING to take the risk, its about me actually being ABLE to take the risk. The short codes themselves cost upwards of $1000 (I need multiple) per month. A high frequency of messages can surge that cost much higher. Being a student, my credit limit will not be very high. With more capital, it is possible to buy messages in bulk or go into unlimited messaging plans that are much more economically feasible when scaling; That way, more users are sustainable. A high cost is fine as long as the cost to user ratio makes sense. With more starting capital, the cost to user ratio is greatly reduced.<p>If any company with an existing ability to send text messages at sustainable rates wants to work with Vepler, that is something that would be equally valuable to me as raw capital. I can come up with the funds for the servers and such on my own if necessary. Getting in touch with such companies is the tricky part.<p>As for the matter of charging for the service: As I said, I am open to it. However, I want to explore all options before going there. Having the site work through twitter involves an added layer of complexity to the site that might simply be beyond the scope of many people. Texting is a core feature of the site. I can launch it without it and I'm sure some people will still find it very useful. I just want to find out if I can avoid doing that, especially since texting makes the site so much more useful.<p>Also, the 2 job offers I have pay fairly well. Enough so that I can afford to pay for the site myself after a few months. However, I would not mind giving up an equity stake to an investor to accelerate the process and potentially have more resources available (investors often provide value through their connections and knowledge that exceeds that of their capital).",1302679085

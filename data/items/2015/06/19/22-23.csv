I think you might just want to say you&#x27;re crowdfunding your Series A.<p>I found it weird that I couldn&#x27;t immediately see how much you were looking to raise, what the terms were and how much you&#x27;ve raised so far right from that page. I found on the deal terms page that you&#x27;re doing it at a $16M pre-money valuation, but I&#x27;d still want to know the other numbers.<p><a href=""https://invest.onevest.com/dealroom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://invest.onevest.com/dealroom</a><p>As I signed up, I laughed at this question:<p><a href=""http://cl.ly/image/2E3H2Z2V0V3R"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/2E3H2Z2V0V3R</a><p>What do most people put down for that? We have effectively infinite time horizons for our investments at YC and we&#x27;re always worried when investors come to us with expectations of returns that are short of many years. The way you&#x27;ve set it up, it makes it seem like shorter expectations for returns are what investors should expect on this platform. I know, probably a subtle conclusion, but still. Good investors think long.<p>It&#x27;s nice to know that I was confirmed right away, but it would have been nice if you took me back to the deal I was trying to look at when you forced me to sign up.<p><a href=""http://cl.ly/image/0D1d302g3J3T"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/0D1d302g3J3T</a><p>Basically, I had to go check my email. Click it. Go browse investments again. Find yours. Click on that page and then to the deal room (since I&#x27;m trying to get more numbers) and I hit this at the bottom of the page:<p><a href=""http://cl.ly/image/291U1E2S071H"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/291U1E2S071H</a><p>Why do I have to request it? Why don&#x27;t you just give it to me? Now I have to wait again. You&#x27;re making me work way too hard to figure out how to give you money. I&#x27;m concerned that you&#x27;re forcing me into this flow so you can measure this activity over doing what&#x27;s best/fastest for making an investment just happen. Of course, now that I have an account, I&#x27;m sure further investments on this platform will be easier, but still. I didn&#x27;t love this process.<p>This all being said, the best way to attract the best investors is to have the best startups. If you have that, people will jump through your hoops.

And of course it&#x27;s a lot easier to prove that someone is selling counterfeit goods from your brand than for them to prove that you intentionally wrote a web crawler to exceed unauthorized access.  And IIRC it&#x27;s considered legal to exceed unauthorized access in order to report a crime (I think that&#x27;s been the case a few times with people who&#x27;ve hacked into computers and then reported child porn they&#x27;ve found to the Feds, which is kinda moral hazard IMO because it&#x27;d be very easy for a hacker to frame someone that way).",1434754750

When I was out looking a few weeks back, my realtor got a call from another realtor who had just closed on a house for $402k, which had been listed at $365k. Lots of people getting blown out by all-cash offers. Every house you look at, the sale history shows it was bought in 2014 for $172k and it&#x27;s on the market for $300k, a lot of that sort of thing. I looked at basically a dilapidated shack that was $300k because it was near the New Seasons on NE 33rd.<p>I waited until I had a full 20% to get in the market, turns out I should have bought earlier because the 20% isn&#x27;t going to help me now anyway given the all-cash offers out there. From what I have heard, a lot of this is due to foreign capital looking for a value store. But I also think this will just continue and get worse, as people in the Bay area look at the quality of life in Portland, compare housing prices, and conclude (rightly IMO) that the move is a no-brainer.",1434754695

9748113,comment,9744059,9746630,0,0,comex,,,"This is somewhat different from the parent&#x27;s view, but personally, I try to turn the list of commits in a given PR into a readable, reviewable &quot;story&quot; of the general steps that need to taken to implement a feature or fix a bug.  (This starts when first writing it, because splitting up changes after the fact is a nightmare.)  However, I do not want to limit myself to finishing and polishing one step before proceeding to the next.  For one thing, my intuition might turn out to be wrong and the overall approach I&#x27;m aiming for might not be a good idea at all, something which I might only figure out when trying to implement the final feature/fix on top of the foundations.  Or it might be a good idea overall, but I might end up realizing later that, say, out of the code I was fixing up in a previous commit, a lot of it is going to be removed by a later step in the refactoring <i>anyway</i>, so I should probably merge those steps or otherwise shuffle up the order.  For another, I will probably just end up making mistakes, some of which I&#x27;ll notice myself and some of which may be noticed in code review; while the &quot;story&quot; is primarily for code review, it is also useful for bisecting, so even changes found in review are good to integrate into the story.<p>As a result, when working on the project I&#x27;m thinking of, I use git rebase -i constantly, as if each commit were a separate file and I were switching between them in my editor.  However, I don&#x27;t actually like that old versions of my code are being thrown away (aside from reflog); I&#x27;d prefer if Git had two axes of history, one &#x27;logical&#x27; and one &#x27;real&#x27; (even if that gives people who already don&#x27;t like branchy histories nightmares).

9748051,comment,9746297,9746297,0,0,themeek,,,"This is the future (but really just one small step) of defensive measures that need to be taken against computer network exploitation.<p>There is essentially no computer network that can not be breached by dedicated and patient (and especially funded) hackers. With increasing importance it is crucial to merely assume that your network has been compromised and work on continual investigation for evidence of full compromise. Assume breach methodology also calls for better credential management: most networks - once on the inside - are very &#x27;flat&#x27; in the sense that it&#x27;s only a couple hops from any user to a network superuser.<p>This is the reason, for example, why Google&#x27;s internal corporate network is now internet accessible (corp.google.com). Google has taken the stance that they can not rely on a network perimeter to keep adversaries out and are proving it by not relying on that perimeter for security.<p>Assumed breach philosophy dictates that detection (e.g. by finding anomolous activity, and alerting on signatures) and response/recovery (e.g. isolation of machines, rolling credentials en masse, forensics to determine scope of compromise) are at least as important as prevention.<p>Another layer of protection is the cloud where scaled efforts can be made to provide security. Here patches, access controls, isolation, logging and audits can be performed more cheaply by the provider than it can be done as a sum over all individual corporations. Of course, the hypervisor and virtual networking themselves provide a strong security container.<p>Many of these cloud providers and large US industries (finance, energy) rest on top of segmented parts of the US&#x27;s DISN (the Defense Information Systems Network) where the DoD can monitor the periphery for cyberattacks and alert companies.<p>This is one example of data sharing - another large investment being made by the US to secure its cyberspace. Corporations can buy services from Mandiant, Fireeye and a number of other private parties for real-time information about threat intelligence (exploit/behavioral signitures and hacking group MOs). While expensive, these subscriptions can pay for themselves if they prevent or mitigate costs associated with a large breach.<p>Data sharing is also done between companies on legal agreement. Large companies form networks on threat intelligence - sharing information about malware signatures, activity, source IPs and account names of malignant activity. This is a cheaper option, though the intelligence is less &#x27;curated&#x27;.<p>Finally, the US provides threat intelligence to onboarded corporations using formats like STIX and TAXI. At the speed of computer networking detection capabilities for tooling and tactics of adversaries can be proliferated cross industry so that, even if a breach is successful, if it is detected the cost for attacking other corporations is raised - malware must be recompiled, etc.<p>Computer intrusion is a cat and mouse game and none of these things, even their sum together, will stop successful breaches. They are, however, cheap means that increase the cost and required sophistication of attackers. Attackers continue to grow in sophistication and today, still outpace all layered defenses.",1434752827

9748048,comment,9746866,9747936,0,0,StephanTLavavej,,,"Yes. In fact, the usual mechanism for doing so is referred to as tag dispatch. For example, an algorithm can take an arbitrary Iterator type, and select between a correct-but-slow algorithm for weak iterators like forward iterators, and a fast algorithm for strong iterators like random-access iterators. The easiest way to achieve this is to call a helper function and pass a tag object whose type is iterator_traits<Iterator>::iterator_category, which might be forward_iterator_tag or random_access_iterator_tag. The helper function is then overloaded on those tags, achieving the effect of a compile-time if. Everything optimizes away (the compiler is very good at noticing do-nothing tag objects).<p>Expression SFINAE offers the ability to detect more properties of things, like is_callable or has_member_function_meow. This can then be used in tag dispatch, or other mechanisms (SFINAE can be used directly to dispatch, but it&#x27;s a more lengthy explanation).",1434752813

I don&#x27;t understand -- why do people think it&#x27;s a good idea for web pages to style my scrollbar?<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s something of an age/cultural separation at play here.  Back in the 90s when desktop environments were a point of wide discussion and interest, there was a piece of &quot;common knowledge&quot; that it&#x27;s important for all the user&#x27;s applications to have a consistent look+feel.  Furthermore, that look+feel was in their control via desktop manager settings: so you could choose large font-sizes, high-contrast window borders and cursors, scrollbar widths, stuff like that.<p>The web used to follow that same themeing, or at least tried to; hence specific UI controls were part of HTML, and the browser could defer to the platform toolkit to render them.  That mechanism has been abandoned by the Web as it has moved towards a full application-platform, where every webpage re-implements its own toolkit and decides how things should look+feel.  Which is directly the opposite of the &quot;consistent-look desktop&quot; philosophy.<p>There are some good reasons why that happened, but I think a whole lot of bad ones too.  Taking the user&#x27;s scrollbar out of their control, into the webpage designer&#x27;s, is just another UI control ripe for abuse.<p>I guess the only question is that, since webpages render their own controls for everything else, shouldn&#x27;t they be able to make the Firefox scrollbar consistent with the rest of it?  But then, why is the Firefox scrollbar coming into play at all, when they could already just implement their own as a Javascript control?",1434751769

In more than three dimensions, that&#x27;s impossible, because there&#x27;s no <i>single</i> direction for that new vector to point.<p>It&#x27;s a hacky way to express the more general concept of <i>orthogonality</i> and <i>handedness</i>: The magnitude of the product we want is proportional to how orthogonal the two vectors are, and the sign is due to a handedness convention we&#x27;ve adopted.<p>Well, if two vectors are orthogonal to any degree at all, they span a two-dimensional surface, so why not define a product which takes two one-dimensional vectors and makes a signed two-dimensional surface out of them, with an area proportional to their lengths and how orthogonal they are and a sign due to a handedness convention? That&#x27;s the wedge product in Clifford algebra.<p>The fun comes when you realize that these signed areas are quaternions and can be used to rotate vectors in arbitrary-dimensional spaces simply by picking vectors which span the desired plane of rotation and choosing apt multiplication rules.<p>The <i>real</i> fun comes when you realize that choosing your metric cleverly gives you one plane where rotations are <i>hyperbolic</i> instead of Euclidean (circular), so you can model accelerations as rotations in the space-time plane.

It may turn out to be a very good thing in moderation.<p>I think people forget that until very recently, San Francisco was actually rather fond of its tech industry.  It was viewed as a creative, slightly quirky, and generally positive culture that fit right in.<p>Tech is actually a pretty good industry to have around.  Supposedly tech jobs create wealth and, as a result, stimulate more non-tech job creation around it.  The problem isn&#x27;t necessarily tech, it&#x27;s too much of a good thing[1]<p>There&#x27;s also a secondary issue, which is that pacific northwestern cities have a middle-to-recent history of not really wanting Californians around, so you might be getting a more negative response from Portland or Seattle to &quot;silicon valley moving north&quot; than you would from Baltimore or St Louis.  An occupational poll I read recently suggests that the computer industry is still looked on positively [2].<p>Overall, though?  If this just means that tech is <i>finally</i> spreading out a bit, so that people can earn a programmer salary in SF (about 114k according to US news best jobs) in a place where this means they can now buy a house, raise a family, and stimulate the local economy (and perhaps an anemic housing market), I see this as a good thing.<p>[1] Perhaps.  There is an argument to be made that tech culture has gotten much uglier with the amount of money that poured in.

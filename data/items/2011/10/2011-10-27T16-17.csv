3164103,comment,3162573,3163930,9,0,WiseWeasel,,,"There are several significant problems with this that <i>do</i> impact regular people as well:<p>1) Developers must invest more time and money in order to support a wider range of firmware revisions, as the user base is more fractured. This leads to less app selection for users, and more buggy behavior on apps that are available. If you're an iOS developer, you can focus on just the last major firmware revision and reach 95%+ of the market, or support the last two major firmware revisions and reach 99%+ of the market, whereas on Android, you're forced to support a few more than that, and the populations stuck at each older revision are much more significant. Read the article for Android stats by revision. Here's an article with a bit more detail on the iOS side:<p><a href=""http://www.marco.org/2011/08/13/instapaper-ios-device-and-version-stats-update"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marco.org/2011/08/13/instapaper-ios-device-and-ve...</a><p>2) Performance and security updates are unavailable, making the user experience sub-optimal, and potentially putting users' personal information at risk.",1319734507

Which is one of the general problems the device has.<p>I'm going to end up getting one because my DS Lite is biting the dust after 5 years of service, and they've structured the prices so that I have no real reason not to just go for it. (I have a significant enough DS backlog that it isn't economical for me to just abandon it, either.) For me, the touchstone game will actually be Super Mario 3D Land in mid-November. Does 3D solve some of the problems that have plagued 3D platformers since day one, like the extreme difficulty in judging depth that we've just sort of hacked around but is still a problem, or not? If it doesn't add anything to that genre, stick a fork in it, 3D is done, or at least portable 3D. But I'd like to see it before I make that call.<p>Even Ocarina of Time isn't a good judge, because that was built for 3D-on-2D screens like everything else. SM3DL will have been built for 3D from the beginning. If that doesn't cut it, nothing will.<p>It's still possible for the 3DS to follow the DS trajectory of recovering from an initial release slump, but only if there's some sort of real benefit to the 3D beyond the first two minutes.",1319734499

The problem I see with this is that the product is directly competing with Macs.<p>For instance, at the high end of Rent-a-Mac you will be paying $49 a month or around $600 a year. In this case it would make more sense to buy a mac mini for $600 which will no doubt perform much better than a virtualization.<p>I think there is probably a pricing model for this type of service, however I'm guessing it would be geared toward large groups (companies) that don't want to invest in buying 20-50 new Macs. It would need to be much much cheaper than the current model or most companies will choose to just buy new Macs especially because they can get a tax write off for new equipment.",1319734352

Its just $10, why not just buy it ? Guess what, I watch tons of movies, don't buy a single DVD. If I like the movie I put it on my netflix queue & then watch it right there. If its not available, no skin off my back - there's plenty of other movies that are available on my queue, some 300+ are unwatched, last I checked. My wife averages 3 books a month. We don't own a single ""book"". She's on her 2nd kindle and all our books are essentially on the AWS. When she moves to her 3rd kindle & so on...the books will continue to be on the cloud. She downloads one book, reads it & then deletes it & downloads the next. 
So yes, owning a Mac, or even a PC is not on my to-do list. The bank gives me a laptop, why should I go buy my own PC ? And for what ? 8 hours of Scala per day at my desk is quite enough. I don't bring my work home. Objective-C will start out as a hobby. I don't know if I'm going to be able to complete my app, put it on the app-store, get customers etc. Seems like a daunting task. So no, I won't buy a Mac. And yes, the world has plenty of people who work for big-corp and pull in 150k coding business apps, with no desire to own Macs & PC, while still doing some hobby coding in some fringe language on the side just to retain their sanity. Office work gets boring after a while, and I plan to write silly time-waster apps in objective C, not your standard issue portfolio optimization code which I do at work anyways.",1319733989

I didn't see blatant sexism, I didn't see harassment, I didn't see something that I was comfortable changing to encourage women in my industry.  I still occasionally quote South Park or make a dirty joke, but nothing targets women specifically: I just can have a crude sense of humor.  Was that what women were concerned about?  Were they offended by my jokes, expecting me to be stiff as a board to avoid offending them?  In my opinion that's expecting special treatment and is sexism in and of itself.<p>In my YC class the 4 women were respected and treated like peers.  Yes, I'm sure there was some flirting, but I didn't see anything that I wouldn't consider more offensive than I've seen guys do to each other on a regular basis.<p>What I learned was actually very interesting: from their perspective I was not the problem.  Somehow in the middle of the media hype about sexism, I had assumed I must be doing something wrong and was trying to figure out what was inappropriate about my behavior.  It turns out there's a whole group of men in tech who are blatantly offensive, harassing, and generally sexist towards women just because they were women.  I genuinely think most men are in the better bucket: we aren't offensive, and provide mostly non-hostile work environments.  We are not part of the problem.  On the other hand, I bet a lot of us aren't part of the solution.<p>This needs to not be a ""men vs women"" battle: this needs to be a ""people vs jerks"" battle.  There are a few sour apples poisoning the environment for everyone, and it needs to stop.  I do think the only way to fix this is for there to be a social change, but most men just need to change the way they act towards other men.  Don't allow it to be ok when one guy crosses the line, and don't just assume HR will take care of it.  Call him out on it.  I'm confident that that's all 99% of guys need to (and can) do to help with this problem.",1319733899

However, there are some problems with the F/OSS type of development in practice. First thing is developers need to put food on the table. In practice, when someone asks ""but is it Open Source?"" about an application/web app, more of them are interested in the ""free as in beer"" aspect or in using it in commercial business for free rather than about customizing it and releasing it to the original devs/other users(regardless of the requirements of the license). This happens all the time on HN when new and cool projects are announced.<p>No one is still able to crack the make money while open sourcing something unless the tool is completely tangential to the way the company makes money(see Google/Apple for examples) or tease it as a way to sell the real ability to use it in closed app(see MySQL).

3164007,comment,3160663,3162311,3,0,othermaciej,,,"Thanks for presenting an actual argument. However, I am not persuaded by your argument. First, there is the timing issue noted by the commenter below. Second, in general, speculative bubbles are <i>not</i> driven by retail savings, or the idea that they are some how extra easy money. Speculative bubbles tend to be driven by (a) sustained periods of market irrationality; and (b) low interest rates. Interest rates are driven primarily by the Federal Reserve, not by retail depositors. The housing bubble in particular was inflated in large part by overly liberal granting of unaffordable mortgages on the expectation that housing prices would continue to grow. Issuing mortgages is a classic commercial bank activity, not an investment activity. The contagion to the wider financial system was through repackaging of mortgages into derivatives, something that was largely done by entities with no commercial banking activity, such as Lehman Brothers, Goldman-Sachs, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Combining commercial and investment banking under one roof was not particularly involved as a driver of the crisis.<p>I am also not persuaded by your linked argument as an argument for Glass-Steagall. It argue for the Volcker rule, which is <i>not</i> the same thing as any former provision of Glass-Steagall. I am not sure why the author relates the two, other than perhaps the fact that Glass-Steagall is a popular talking point. To be more clear on the difference, the provision of Glass-Steagall that tends to capture the popular imagination, and which was repealed in 1999, was a rule against combining investment banking and commercial banking within the same entity. The Volcker Rule would instead forbid banks from trading for their own account, while still allowing them to combine commercial and investment activity. I don't have enough knowledge of the Volker rule to argue for or against it, but I the sketchy argument made in its favor and the attempt to conflate it with Glass-Steagall are not terribly persuasive.<p>Finally I don't think there is any onus on me to offer an argument against Glass-Steagall, until someone presents an argument in its favor. Surely the burden of proof should be on those favoring a new regulation. That being said, the major reason the rule was repealed is that it made US banks uncompetitive compared to foreign banks, with no clear sign that the US banking system was more stable than foreign banking systems as a result. There is no particular reason to think this has changed. So reinstating the rule would make US banks less competitive and perhaps drive more financial activities overseas, for no clear gains.",1319733596

A floating city configuring an independent libertarian utopia nation. A billion-dollar indoor ski resort just outside Atlanta. A bridge from Spain to Africa sporting a 5 mile suspended span. A world-class [fill in the blank, how much ya got?] facility annex to a super-mall in ""why would anyone move there"" Syracuse NY. A ""fast ferry"" across Lake Ontario connecting Toronto with ""why would you go there"" Rochester NY. And so on, one project after another with big flashing ""ain't gonna happen"" signs over them.<p>Then I realized. It wasn't success of the project that was the goal, it was keeping a small team of creatives employed in a perpetual state of promotion and study-funding: find someone with deep enough pockets, and they'll shell out a livable fee to be able to say ""hey, look at this..."" to other deep pockets. No way that Atlanta ski resort would happen, but the idea was exciting enough to elicit enough funding for studies to pay the bills (at least until the vital-to-snow-making nearby lake almost dried up) for a few people in modest offices.

Let's say Germany as a nation holds financial claims on Greece denominated as X. If, as a nation, they intend to continue running net exports, this means that those financial claims never need to be redeemed. If the assets are in the form of e.g. 10 year bonds, then Germany could just exchange them for new 10 year Greek bonds at maturity. So long as Germany and Greece both accept the game, their will never be any problem of insolvency.<p>This rollover game could continue <i>indefinitely</i>. That's my whole point. It would only have to stop if, at some point, Germany decides that it wants to become a net importer, which is equivalent to running down net financial claims against other countries. Then at some point they would want to reduce the amount of financial claims against Greece, and Greece would have to cancel their liabilities, ostensibly by sending real goods to Germany. The point is, however, that the German elite is totally hell-bent on staying a net exporting country forever.<p>Of course, this is not what happens, because micro economics is different from macro economics. The micro actors behave like you explain, and their behavior is perfectly reasonable from their individual point of view (well, except that it is totally unreasonable for non-capitalist Germans to be in favor of net exports, but they have no say in the matter at the moment). However, on the macro level, this creates behavior that is quite literally schizophrenic.",1319733333

Even better, now that iOS5 has arrived with (very pleasantly smooth) support for the 3GS, the choice is ""do I support 3.x or 5.x"" since the last years of devices ALL support the APIs in the most recent OS.  That is huge.<p>Just yesterday I realized that a long-standing bug is fixed by iOS5, and that since nearly all of our customers will be running 3GS or newer hardware, I can depend on that fix with confidence when we release our next version soon.",1319731880

I was planning on writing some idea giveaway series in my blog, and post the links here. Anyway I'll just list my ideas.<p>1. A Backup Service for all Cloud Data. Eg: Imagine if you google account stops working, then all your gmail, gdocs, blog posts all gone, But, services like google give access to your data, but its not easy to figure out for users, so, a service with monthly or yearly subscription, that backups all users data from multiple sites, automatically and periodically.<p>2. A Market Place for T-Shirts, I love the customink, Just stumbled upon it today. But, I was looking for a market place to sell T-Shirts, Like, I create a T-shirt with some wording, which is inexpensive. Then, the site prints and sells/ships it to costumers, who want one.

It's true that evolution (that is, the gradual changes in the characteristics of populations) was nearly universally accepted relatively quickly, but natural selection as a mechanism was not. In fact, for some decades in the late 19th and early 20th centuries natural selection was widely regarded as a minor contributor to evolution.<p>This was not a matter of anyone believing that natural selection didn't occur, but simply an argument over the relative magnitudes of different forces. Alternative drivers of evolution included neo-Lamarckism.

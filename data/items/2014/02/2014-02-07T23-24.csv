7199617,comment,7198957,7199422,4,0,wlievens,,,"I&#x27;ve never met these elusive mysterious men in the software industry that are negative towards women, or towards the idea of women working in the software industry. I have however met plenty of women (high school era mostly) who were very negative about the software industry because it &quot;is not about people&quot; and involves &quot;sitting at a desk all day&quot;. So I guess these same women today just work some other desk job that just pays half as much, so they complain about gender income inequality.<p>Don&#x27;t want to be sexist here; I would strongly encourage anyone (male or female) to work in our exciting industry. I just don&#x27;t think men are more to blame for the imbalance than women.",1391817571
7199616,comment,7194907,7197908,2,0,icu,,,"I believe it goes much further back and is much more deeper than 911.<p>In 1975 Senator Frank Church said the following:<p>&quot;In the need to develop a capacity to know what potential enemies are doing, the United States government has perfected a technological capability that enables us to monitor the messages that go through the air. Now, that is necessary and important to the United States as we look abroad at enemies or potential enemies. We must know, at the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left such is the capability to monitor everything—telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn’t matter. There would be no place to hide.<p>If this government ever became a tyrant, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capability of this technology.<p>I don’t want to see this country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.&quot;  (For verified sources of this quote visit the Wikipedia page on the Church Committee: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee."" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee.</a>)<p>These words almost exactly cover the situation now as they did nearly 40 years ago!!!<p>If anyone thinks the conduct of the Government in the next 40 years will be different they are dreaming.  The United Surveillance Sates of America is an entrenched practice.<p>My conclusion is that technologists hold the key to hope in what would otherwise be a hopeless situation.  The hackers here can create technology that can subvert the Government&#x27;s tyranny.<p>Civilian counterintelligence starts with counter-technology.",1391817568

I&#x27;ve never been convinced.<p>I hear an incredible number of stories about people who wanted to use Ubuntu, but couldn&#x27;t because of one Windows app.  Increasingly, I hear the inverse -- people who are happily using Ubuntu now because Wine works well enough.<p>Data is hard to come by, but my best estimates put Wine&#x27;s install base at something on the order of 10-25% of Ubuntu users.  That means millions of users of my packages.  Most are running games.  Some use it for some sort of critical business function like a legacy app.<p>I&#x27;ve contracted with a good number of companies who use Wine for critical business purposes.  Wine is quickly becoming the porting tool of choice for making Mac and Linux versions of Windows software -- often times the game will work without modification, and when it doesn&#x27;t these days it is dramatically cheaper to improve Wine than to rewrite applications.<p>I do understand some of the skepticism though.  A single bug can render an application completely unusable, so from a user&#x27;s perspective it&#x27;s very hard to tell whether Wine is 99% done or 5% done.  But in the future, you won&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re using Wine -- it&#x27;ll silently be powering your steam games.",1391817531

That may mean that you have to get a code, connect to the manufacturer&#x27;s server, etc. to get the app to disable the bricking chip unlocked or downloaded, and the additional security theater that would entail - and the bitrot that would happen for older model phones when you had to download it (after a &quot;hard reset&quot;) and the manufacturer is either defunct or doesn&#x27;t care anymore.<p>This bill has too many goodies for too many entrenched interests not to pass.<p>edit2: &quot;Rightful owner&quot; is <i>really</i> creeping me out.

It needs a specific version of Wine to work (some 1.5.x release), so I&#x27;m using it on a PlayOnLinux virtual drive (that way I can easily have multiple Wine versions and configs on my system, tailored to each software). The hardest part was making the file associations work correctly (because that was not explained in the tutorial, but it was easy to figure out). Word, Excel and PowerPoint work fine. VBA does not work (not something I need).<p>It suffers from some graphic bugs (mostly in the properties dialog, for objects in PowerPoint for example; usually you can fix it by reloading the dialog), also, TrueType doesn&#x27;t look perfect. I can&#x27;t remember having it crash heavily.<p>I needed MS Office because while Open/LibreOffice is good enough for most things, and is actually more than sufficient if you write your materials from beginning to end in them and never export to proprietary formats (i.e., always keep saving in ODF), the compatibility layer with MS Office is not perfect and is not sufficient for more advanced things (such as the fancy 3D-and-the-like styling options my colleagues insist on using). The imperfections* of the document compatibility layer become a problem when working on the same document with people who use MS Office.<p>Using a virtual machine would probably work, too... if I had an infinite amount of Windows licenses. I can&#x27;t use the license from my real-hardware install, as I still need Windows-on-real-hardware for a few things (to do with drivers and device flashing).<p>Using Office was the main reason why I had to reboot into Windows, and so I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this setup. My productivity has increased a lot (no need to wait for reboots). Besides Office, I also use Wine to run the emulator of a platform for which I develop software (the emulator is not open source, and are not available for any Unix but OS X, which I don&#x27;t have access too). So Wine does a really great job for me, doing things that I think can be called &quot;effective usage&quot; (in fact, I don&#x27;t run any games under Wine).<p>* MS Office import/export is actually quite good for a FOSS piece of software, and while the &quot;imperfections&quot; are being perfected as new versions are released, Microsoft too keeps releasing new Office versions with more shiny features, so I understand the difficulty on keeping up with the compatibility on closed formats.",1391816789

It wasn&#x27;t really necessary, but for our blog I chose to use a Rails CMS, and hosted it on Digital Ocean with Nginx and Unicorn managing requests.<p>Below are some examples of my work.<p>My personal blog, which is responsive -- it takes inspiration from other blogging platforms but I wrote all the code from scratch. \nhttp://blog.tommaxwell.me<p>My personal site, which is also responsive and written from scratch:\nhttp://tommaxwell.me<p>I also have some projects on my Github profile that I worked on. Chakra is the Rails app that I wrote all myself.\nhttp://github.com/tommaxwell<p>I have a solid understanding of OO JavaScript, CSS3, responsive design, Rails, and more. Preferably the projects I&#x27;m looking for are front-end oriented.<p>You can also find me around the web:\nhttp://twitter.com/tommaxwelll\nhttp://medium.com/@tommaxwelll<p>If anyone has any small projects -- maybe even some small work here and there that you need done -- I&#x27;d love to talk to you.<p>tommaxwell95@gmail.com",1391816004

Features are easy to add on to an application, but time, once lost, can never be regained.<p>Optimization usually requires fundamentally changes to architecture, and in the case of Django it is well-known that it is not for building fast or highly scalable apps.<p>Functional Reactive Programming is far better for building high performance apps.<p>Specifically, you are asking about code swapping which is something that is only used by developers during development, not during production. Most developers deal with such problems by getting faster hardware.<p>And finally, even if Django development stops today and it never gets any new features, it is still an ideal tool for building apps that are in its sweet spot. And it is easy to supplement with things like Celery or RabbitMQ to communicate with scalable non-Django backends. Nothing to fear here, move along.",1391815895

It&#x27;s rare that you can come in the door and start reinventing a place, but given a solid track record - you absolutely can or at least be given the autonomy to work on more satisfying things.<p>* I don&#x27;t have start-up experience to make a direct comparison, but I do know that the typical rates I&#x27;ve seen for equivalent roles in a few start-ups and even some of the prestigious SV BigCos are low to terrible relative to what&#x27;s available to competent people with a track record in &quot;enterprise&quot;.<p>* If you take it seriously, I think there&#x27;s actually something a lot of satisfaction to be had in an enterprise.

In fact, I would say that the moment a hard and fast rule is discovered, is the exact moment that it becomes invalid.<p>However, even in your example, the higher prices will only come in time.  This is assuming we are talking about a commodity good that is traded on an open market.<p>The immediate effect of a sudden reduction in demand is an increase in inventories on the sell side.  If there is no expectation of resumption of demand, the inventory holders are likely to panic and sell at a reduced price to cut inventories.  This is a classic case of &quot;first out the door wins&quot; and is what crashes are made of.  They will also cut manufacturing (or mining or farming), but the affect of this on the price will only manifest once the reduction in production makes it through the supply chain.  For something like corn, this could take upwards of a year.<p>Obviously, all this is affected by a large number of variables: warehousing costs, profit margins, manufacturing complexity and lead time, pricing power, tooling costs and other capital expenditures, etc.",1391815036

It&#x27;s not my fight, though, so I wish you luck. I agree it isn&#x27;t equal, in many definitions of the word, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily associate it with manly or womanly in terms of sexuality/identity. It&#x27;s simply a field. A field that has, up until now, been primarily men and perhaps even primarily negative men and perhaps, again, men who are negative towards women because they are insecure about it. I think it says more about them than the field, but I could be wrong. I still stand by the thought that programming is inherently nothing other than a field, ripe for societies to use or abuse as they will. I could say the same about any field, teaching children I guess is the opposite at least in terms of number by gender.<p>Not sure what the large, burly man colleague of yours has to do with my point, though. He could be a four foot tall waif and I wouldn&#x27;t think any differently of the field.

Your bottom line is interesting, but mine is more or less, &quot;Don&#x27;t feel bad about falling short of something you have complete control of.&quot; There&#x27;s no reason to feel as though you need to live up to some definition of sexuality when it involves identity.

My wife, back when I had one, never seemed interested in an egalitarian split for chores like, say, replacing the car&#x27;s serpentine belt and tensioner, or sorting out the electrical fault that&#x27;d stopped the taillights working -- or, for that matter, taking out the garbage. (Which, incidentally, I gather from empirical evidence <i>does</i> count as a &quot;manly activity&quot;, presumably because garbage is often heavy and occasionally malodorous.) So also for yardwork and most repairs to the domicile; in general, if the job seemed likely to involve sweating, swearing, or a risk of ending up bleeding, the job was mine, and the egalitarian split business applied only to the rest.<p>Which got galling after a while; I don&#x27;t mind mowing, weeding, edging, and sweeping, or spending six hours getting filthy with my arm jammed to the elbow up the ass end of a car engine, but when I&#x27;ve been doing that all day, and have finally finished up and got a shower, a beer, and a piece of the couch, I don&#x27;t <i>give</i> a damn if it&#x27;s my turn to cook -- and nor should I, because I&#x27;ve <i>done</i> my fair share.<p>> We have at least two viable role models for women: girly woman and equal breadwinner woman.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about that.

While I&#x27;ve known rather fewer people whose marriages have involved men and women who more closely followed what the modern age pleases itself to regard as outdated, patriarchal, oppressively stereotypical gender roles, almost all of those whom I do know are still married, and indeed many have been for longer than I&#x27;ve been alive. Causation is always a tricky beast to corner, but at the very least there&#x27;s a strong correlation there, and I tend to think there&#x27;s a reason for that.<p>(I&#x27;d also note, parenthetically, that the men I&#x27;ve known who&#x27;ve been married to your &quot;equal breadwinner women&quot; haven&#x27;t been men I&#x27;ve found particularly worthy of respect, nor for the most part have I had the impression they had much respect for themselves.

Your question appears to relate to the efficiency of vacuum storage bottles, but that&#x27;s a different case with a different logic.<p>For a vacuum thermos, the presence of the vacuum represents a less efficient heat conduction medium than air (or foam), which uses conduction and convection to transfer energy. The difference in temperature between the contents and the environment also plays a part.<p>But for a planet, no atmosphere means radiation operates at maximum efficiency, and radiation is a very efficient energy transfer method, especially when there&#x27;s a large temperature difference between the object and space.<p>Even on earth (with an atmosphere), radiation directly to space turns out to be more efficient than atmospheric conduction and convection, such that objects on the surface can fall well below air temperature if the sky is clear of clouds.<p>It&#x27;s not uncommon for earth&#x27;s surface to drop below air temperature overnight, which can produce such effects as &quot;radiation fog&quot; near the ground, caused by condensation of water vapor in the air cooled by the surface.<p>It&#x27;s common to believe that on earth, air conduction/convection is the majority heat transfer method and radiation is less effective, but in fact it&#x27;s the other way around.",1391814079

there was a comment on why Winer recently purchased a Eee100 with MS Windows and the answer was because his tools are Win/Mac. The point I was making is Outliners have a long history, Winer was there early.

273625,story,,,32,48,hhm,"Ask HN: why do we have less science related posts now that in the past?",,"This is something that I don't really understand well. Why do we have less science (or music, arts, whatever not directly programming & startups related) content here? If I remember it well, we used to have about 50% programming & startups, and 50% content that was interesting to hackers even if it was outside of those subjects. I even think the name change to Hacker News was to avoid focusing too much in startup & programming content (the previous name was Startup News)... why did the community almost entirely drop it?<p>I think the problem isn't that we don't like it when it appears, but that for some reason people isn't posting it so often. I haven't had problems posting maths, science, etc content into the first page, so maybe if everyone is interested in this we could try to post such content more often?<p>What do you think?<p>(Sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker.)",1218509148

Much like most ""high performance proprietary video compression methods"" these days are just ripoffs of H.264 (see SVQ3 and RV30/RV40), I would not at all be surprised if even their non-vaporware tech is copied.<p>1.5x better image compression than JPEG-2000 is rather easy; H.264 can pull that off handily with intra compression.  2x better than MP3?  They're probably using HE-AACv2.  2x better than PNG isn't difficult either; lossless wavelet or just something FFV1-style should be sufficient.  25% better than zip?  LZMA.<p>Of course, eventually people will realize that almost all this stuff is patented up the wazoo...<p>Another thing I found rather amusing was ""5x better than JPEG, 1.5x better than JPEG-2000""; implying that somehow JPEG-2000 was over three times better than JPEG...<p><a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/JPEG_JFIF_and_2000_Comparison.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/JPEG_JFIF...</a>",1218508144

273611,comment,273577,273577,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"The video that is being shown is a rip off of a movie that is actually fairly famous in 3D graphics circles.  It has been around for years, at least 3 by my count.  This demo was made almost certainly without the author's permission.  Further, it demos only video editing skills, as the actual rendering was done years ago.  It is interesting that they are leading the viewer of the video to believe that this is a world in the cloud that is being rendered real time.  It seems a little less than honest to me.<p>By the way, the video can be found at:<p><pre><code>    http://3dblasphemy.com/personal/CITY.html
</code></pre>
For those who are interested, the 'tell' is that the camera angles are exactly the same as those in the 3D Blasphemy video.  Additionally, the apartment that is rendered a few minutes into the video is rasterized and not raytraced, like the city is.<p>I am curious, now, to see OTOY in action.

273601,comment,273034,273554,0,0,tom234,,,"Good reply. Thanks for replying. I personally think it ultimatily boils down to content that the search engine has. That is the index in this case for Google. I think the semantics and the semantic web will make a huge difference. How I look at it is that because Google's result for ""c# string replace"" <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=c%23+string+replace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=c%23+string+replace</a> is much better than Mahalo's <a href=""http://www.mahalo.com/C#_string_replace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mahalo.com/C#_string_replace</a>, Google is good. I was thinking about how the search will be in the next 2-3 years. The main problem I see with is the discovery of new content in search engine, and I think Google basically brute forced the whole thing by trying to index everything and hope that the results are there and which works alright for the query above. It basically boils down to 100 thousand crawlers and huge index. If social search engine cannot discover this page <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fk49wtc1.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fk49wtc1.aspx</a> for this query ""c# string replace"" for instance, it is game over. Google is alive because of these kinds of results. My main concern is how to discover new content and without the burden of updating the index and bruce forcing the whole thing by indexing every word on a webpage. I know Google indexes pieces of webpages but still it is ton of words to index. I just see huge problem with creating huge index like Google and maintaining that index which is also a lot of work. Also I don't have the resources (money) to create a huge index, which is another main reason.<p>Good discussion by the way.",1218506687

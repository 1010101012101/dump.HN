That would become nearly impossible to do correctly with a proportional font.<p>Another thing is easily formatting tabular-looking data (e.g. array initialisers) reasonably well. Proportional fonts mean this can&#x27;t be done, and existing formatted data looks like a mess. Moving the cursor vertically with a proportional font also causes it to distractingly jump left and right instead of in a straight line.<p>Has anyone who prefers proportional fonts considered whether they&#x27;d like proportional <i>vertical</i> spacing (i.e. the height of each line varies depending on what characters are in it)? That would be the other extreme of variable spacing.",1442026660

Well, it was just an excuse for me to go off on a tangent! :-)<p>For the example you posted, I would classify that as column alignment rather than indentation. Just to clarify my terminology, what I call indentation is something that happens at the beginning of a line only. Any additional spacing after the first nonblank character is column alignment.<p>So the spaces before the if and elseif are indentation, and the extra spaces within the lines are column alignment (in my nomenclature).<p>The column alignment in your example is pretty appealing, but it does have some of the same problems as other forms of column alignment. When we get to ten or eleven tests, things have to get juggled around again. Do you do this:<p><pre><code>    if		( $test[0] )	func1()\n    elseif	( $test[1] )	func2()\n    ...\n    elseif	( $test[10] )	func3()\n</code></pre>\nor this?<p><pre><code>    if		( $test[0]  )	func1()\n    elseif	( $test[1]  )	func2()\n    ...\n    elseif	( $test[10] )	func3()\n</code></pre>\nor go all-out with something like this?<p><pre><code>    if		( $test[ 0] )	func1()\n    elseif	( $test[ 1] )	func2()\n    ...\n    elseif	( $test[10] )	func3()\n</code></pre>\nI think basically I am just lazy and found all of this alignment so tedious that I looked for ways to avoid it. :-)",1442024291

I don&#x27;t put a space before the open paren on a function call, so I don&#x27;t put one there on a statement that has parens either.

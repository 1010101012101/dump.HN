2367634,comment,2366954,2367533,0,0,JoseVigil,,,"Hi Anm,<p>Years of work worth reading your feedback, appreciate very much.<p>I am very interested what you say here:\n""My concern is that the primary multi-touch gestures chosen are two handed."". I think that ultimately there will have to be a standard for handed, but an evolved set of gestures. I am working on that, you know why?<p>I strongly believe that there has to be a balance in terms of handed gestures to execute on what has been selected (our innovation, do a gesture on a selection). There will be a time when gestures have to evolve to cope with demanding tasks at home with multiple touch devices in almost all glass/crystal/plastic surfaces, so there is going to be plenty of need. New types of gestures that can be learned and reproduced fast. Nor the palm graffiti type nor the imagery type (pinch, stretch, and swipe). New types.<p>Something is in the middle that can be worldwide interpreted and very easy to execute, that is the key. As an example we created the Twitter peak "">"" gesture cause is fast and symbolic. That creation process has to be applied many more times again for new gestures with an implicit action and a symbol. Also the key can be to synthesize the gesture to a minimal expression.<p>Also, once the user has done the gesture four times, the fifth goes on its own. So its all about learning curve. We humans have a great ability to remember mechanical movements. I would love to have a more consistent scientific background. Any doctor around?.<p>This is the way I think we can overcome the real problem and concern you are pointing out and that I agree 100%. Of course tablet will be a superb place to run PadKite.<p>Great feedback, really.",1301039962

I would say this has nothing to do with age, just a certain sense of what's valuable.<p>While time has shown that the average person can find a use for Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare, I still find it very difficult to see how ""another"" social app... and a photo-sharing one at that... is going to draw the kind of crowd that would make this extremely high valuation reasonable.<p>I would agree that, based on numerous comments across the web, the only reason for such a high valuation is because of possible acquisition. But this article specifically mentions that the company is not interested in being acquired, so I guess I just don't ""get it"".<p>During the dot-com bubble, ""eyeballs"" were becoming as important a metric for companies as ""revenue"" or ""profit"".

2367600,comment,2366896,2367139,0,0,derleth,,,"Basically, I'm a little tired of people using JavaScript to implement the basic functionality of a text-oriented website.<p>A blog is, by definition, fundamentally text-oriented, as opposed to, say, a vlog (video log) or a podcast, and so should work acceptably well, if not attractively or with all of the intended features, without JavaScript. Ideally, it should degrade gracefully without CSS, too, but that amount of respect for your readers is probably a lost cause.<p>And it is all about respect for your readers: Books don't demand you read them on a veranda attached to a five-star hotel in New Delhi regardless of how much that would improve the experience. Books are quite happy to be read in a grimy bus terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, if that's the best the reader can manage. Text-based web pages are quite capable of being read, at an ugly 'bus terminal in Hoboken' level, in browsers like Lynx or Netscape 4 or Internet Explorer 6, and the designer should not presume to demand that their readership have access to first-class tickets booked on Firefox 4 or Chrome 11.<p>Sometimes this isn't possible. Sometimes, you really do want to put video on the web and people who can't handle video are out of luck. However, you and I both know about the impact open formats and captioning and other measures of respect for the audience can have.<p>Finally, I could mention the blind tied to screenreaders, but that's insulting both to the technology of screenreader software, which I hear is fairly advanced these days, and to the authors of web pages, who should not need their noses rubbed in the existence of physical limitations simply to be convinced to show basic consideration for their audience.<p>(Personally, I find a .30-06 at medium range quite suffices.)",1301038476

Some believe up votes can mean agreement, but that obviously this has a limit.  Since a down vote definitely doesn't mean disagreement, it only follows that the opposite shouldn't mean agreement. That would only serve to dilute the conversation. Like I said though, this is just a rough consensus.<p>Here is a previous HN discussion on comments [1].<p>And I'll save you the trouble of reading through to an even earlier discussion[2] where PG weighed in to say <i>""I think it's ok to use the up and down arrows to express agreement.""</i> But this was on a different topic regarding troll-like behavior, so it's not entirely clear what his thoughts are.<p>But a person is going to use their up votes to mean whatever they want them to mean. If you want to up vote in agreement, go ahead, no one is going to stop you. I only up vote things I agree with if I think it adds to the conversation.

People specialize at tasks to hopefully increase the total effectiveness of a system to more than it would be if everyone did everything. However, this means that if the only people who have the power to do something unionize, other people can’t get that thing without agreeing to their demands.<p>You could say in this situation, the core devs of Arch “unionized” to demand either coding help or patience from those who want the feature. I’m not interested enough in this situation to be bothered to research whether this is a reasonable demand. If it is unreasonable, c) is the case, and if it is reasonable, a) or b) is, but that’s as far as I care to investigate.",1301037306

I'm not sure how much of this will be blocked out by the fading social graph but I thought of some pretty cool examples that make this app more interesting than I thought:\n1. Photos from a house party, I'm sure you could see some entertainig pics.\n2. Buying a house, it would be cool if you could actually get a ton of pics and videos from the previous family to see if you'll enjoy the house and if they appeared to take care of it.\n3. I've never been extremely drawn to social media or even taking tons of pictures all the time. This, however, finally made it interesting to me and I will use it. Assuming there are others like me, there is a market for that.<p>I really have nothing to hide that would cause me to fear the data from this app. Perhaps ignorant of what they could do (I can think of a lot of kind of creepy things) but it doesn't bother me if they know about my location surroundings, etc... Someone did say privacy matters much more when you have kids, I guess that mint be the case down the road.",1301037276

You usually have to add a force argument for it to do anything that can cause irreversible damage.<p>Which can be frustrating as well, at least with git the commands work the first time :)<p>A better approach (as long as no external pushing/pulling is done) IMO would be to execute the command immediately, but allow undo functionality.",1301037245

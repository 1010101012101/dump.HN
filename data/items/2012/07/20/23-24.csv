It is offensive in that it squashes any possibility that whatever service it was the startup had would compete for their similar service.<p>In cases like instagram, it was an obvious choice for Facebook as Facebook is the largest picture sharing service which also wraps all sorts of meta data around the users who are viewing those pics.<p>Thus, with instagrams reach it fractures attention from facebooks services/user. By acquiring them and ultimately layering the instagram features into facebooks pic offering the attention is not diverted from Facebook.<p>Attention is the resource that social services are harvesting from their users and monetizing.<p>If you're not looking at it from this perspective, then I don't believe your critically thinking about what it is that the Internet is, or how to build something that will last.<p>Companies that provide features, utility and services that keep the attention of users (especially when providing no physical product) are those that will have longevity.<p>So, capturing those that would build things that direct user attention away from your product is critical to these huge companies.",1342828688

4273381,comment,4270445,4273248,1,0,nirvdrum,,,"No, it's as I stated initially.  If you're unable to keep track of the rules of your native language, something that should be second nature, I have severe doubts about your ability to keep track of the rules in Scala, Ruby, or whatever else.  If it's simply that you don't proofread or don't care to, I have no reason to believe you'll do so when dealing with code.  That problem is exacerbated in dynamic languages where typos won't be caught until runtime.  Both writing natural language and code are forms of expressing ideas, problems, & solutions cogently -- you just have different grammar forms for the various languages, each with their own rules.  The two are even merging with things like Cucumber.<p>No, I don't have exhaustive studies on this.  That neither proves nor disproves anything.  I never stated any of this beyond my own opinion, which has been formed and reinforced by 15 years of working in open source, running & working at startups, and working at big companies.<p>That aside, code is typically only part of your job.  Documentation, blog posts, interacting with customers, partners, team members, etc. are all part of engineering. You don't have to like it or think it's just, but people do and will form opinions about you on this stuff.  Many times it won't be other engineers, which you may be fine with, but engineering alone often doesn't make a successful business.

Can Google just hire a lot more programmers and give them something to work on? Can they just gobble up a lot of startups and with the cash horde turn them hugely profitable. At least from what Schmidt says in the interview, it looks like there is no easy answer to the question of what to do with the money. I guess even companies like Apple will have this problem. Lots of money, no idea what to do with it. Even things like self driving cars and google glass are really peanuts in terms of investments when it comes to googles finances.<p>Things like Space, energy seem too risky and biotech, medicine etc. seem to be too regulated. While I have no idea who is right or wrong, I was certainly surprised that Schmidt did not dismiss Thiel's comment about not having a clue about what to do with the cash.<p>I am not an economist, but I feel scared when the wealthiest people have no idea how to rapidly grow the money they have gathered. Coz they own most of it... and if all they can do is slosh it around from account to account and not directing it towards making employees/machines produce ""stuff that matters"", we will rather stagnate quickly. Once the developing countries catch upto the west and we automate whatever we can easily automate, the whole world will be left with stagnant economies. A whole planet with nothing much to do apart from fighting over depleting resources.<p>I desperately want google to be able to spend that cash heap on making something people want.

4273263,comment,4272928,4273051,18,0,earl,,,"The app store for ios has exerted massive negative price pressure on apps, including creating a norm of free or $1 apps.  I know it's basic psychology, but it still amazes me that tons of people using a $200 phone that costs on the order of $80/mo to use bitch endlessly in reviews and negatively rate apps for charging the ginormous price of $3.  Or something equally out of line.  This is exacerbated by shitty discovery in the app store.  There's massive returns to being on the top app in category X list, and that's very difficult to do at higher prices.  Plus you can't create paid upgrades without creating a new product in the app store, forcing you to start from zero with marketing and list rank.  I predict the mac app store will likewise exert downward price pressure on app prices.<p>Sparrow is really really cheap.  A generation ago I used eudora, which cost $50 to $100, for email.  So between the mid to late 90s and 2012, the price fell something like 80 to 90 percent to $10 for the mac program.  The above is worsened by the rise of decent free email clients since it diminishes the audience.<p>If you do the math, you have to sell a fuckton of $2.10 cent apps to afford salaries for good developers: say four people at $200k/year fully loaded (salary, health insurance, ss, medicare, office space, internet, diet coke, coffee, macbooks).  That's 380k sales just to tread water.  And we didn't deduct marketing expenses which are probably significant: you'll have someone fulltime doing seo / sem / banging on blogs and reviewers to get organic / etc.  Plus, again, Apple has created a norm where apps get updated forever for free.  So that $2.10 is close to being a <i>lifetime</i> value for a user.  That means you probably can't use sem for user acquisition: a <i>wildly</i> optimistic 10 percent clickthrough <i>and purchase</i> rate (an order of magnitude high for most things) and 20 cents per click (also wildly cheap) puts you at $2.00.<p>I presume Apple does this because of classic economics: increase demand by decreasing the price of complements.  But if developers can't get paid, users can't have nice things.  And I'm not an ios or mac dev, but looking at the interactions in their apps, they seem super custom.  That means you have to go to the bottom of frameworks, increasing development costs.",1342825220

Just releasing a new app doesn't reward or encourage existing users to upgrade, and as an end-user, it kind of sucks to have a bunch of copies of the same app lying around.",1342825206

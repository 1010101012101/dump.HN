This is not Arrington's money, so why is he being rewarded for investing it? Shouldn't the investors themselves be the ones rewarded?<p>The answer I see to this is that Arrington is rewarded because he is making the investments <i>on behalf</i> of the investors. I would hazard a guess that many of the people investing in Arrington's fund made their money outside of tech, and therefore do not possess the skill set to critically analyze tech investments. But they know the technology sector is a good place to invest, so they hand their money to someone with the proper skill set to invest in it. In this case, that person is Arrington.<p>He is rewarded because were it not for him, the people investing in his fund would be unable to intelligently invest in the tech sector.",1357117096

Because of this, people do not like hearing the financial sector described in positive terms. So, often when people are confronted with a positive viewpoint of it, they have no recourse but to caste it as ""spin.""<p>Society has harbored a distaste for finance many times throughout history. The Catholic church even went so far as to forbid usury, preferring to delegate tasks as inferior as money lending to Jews. Not surprisingly, this distaste becomes most evident following an economic downturn. Before the current recession, society's view of ""Wall Street"" was generally very positive. Now, things are a bit different.<p>The fact of the matter is that we do not live in an ideal world. But we want to move toward one. The best way to do that is through a strong economy. A financial sector is a necessary part of a strong economy. But I worry that people discount its value to our country.<p>As long as people view the financial sector distastefully, we are going to need to incentivize working in it. Otherwise the only people working in the financial sector will be people who don't care if they are viewed as working in the dregs of society. That is not the type of person we want in charge of the economy.<p>(FYI - No, I am not going into finance.)",1357116886

And if you're not constrained by power use or computing power, you can also use redundant subsystems: I imagine something like a satellite, receiving high radiation that consistently corrupts cache or RAM but runt 5 identical OSs on five identical subsystems and on every ""high stakes"" decision it does a ""voting session"", choosing the result of a function with the most out of 5 votes and resetting the state of the disagreeing systems with the winning ones, and a similar type of reliabilty by duplication for medical devices or aircraft systems... And going further, you can always replace an expensive reliable satellite with a swarm of cheaper ones that can fail. I think we'll choose the ""swarm way"" for more and more things and this will relax reliability requirements for individual components and at the whole swarm level we'll have ""good enough"" statistical reliability instead.<p>And any ""swarm"" can conceptually be seen as a black box, once you accept its probabilistic nature and the low but measurable likelihood of it being wrong, and maybe using a ""swarm of swarms"" if one swarm's <i>p</i> value of being true is not good enough for your application.<p>The ""fractal attention to detail"" seems needed when you need <i>both</i> reliability and you have serious power or computing resources constraints.

4995850,comment,4994792,4994792,6,0,jinfiesto,,,"I can't help but feel that the recent mindfulness fad, and some of this blog, misses the point. While meditation, and mindfulness in general, does have plenty of wonderful side effects, to meditate for any reason other than because it's the truth will eventually be self-defeating. The only thing that any of us are truly capable of losing is the present moment. Meditation is simply a pure expression of that fact. When you meditate for any of its myriad benefits, without framing it in the context of an expression of ultimate reality, it becomes just another form of grasping.<p>This is not to say that you should never use meditation as a tool. Samatha meditation is practiced explicitly to improve concentration, and Vipassana to improve insight. That being said, be mindful of your grasping and try to avoid meditating into your preconceptions. Ultimately meditation is a pure surrender to what is; not striving towards what you believe should be.<p>""Those who have great realization of delusion are buddhas; those who are greatly deluded about realization are sentient beings.""\n-Zen master Eihei Dogen",1357116423

4995816,comment,4989327,4994119,1,0,ttiurani,,,"The problem with one JAR is that you will then have to configure runtime in production which delivery is used and also, if there are alternative plugs (or jacks), what set of plugs you activate. That would have to be done with an external config file or database row, command line parameters or some super GUI. The problem is that those are really dangerous configuration options, because changing any of them, results in catastrophic failure: e.g. someone might accidentally change a plug configuration option to another value, and your MySQL turns into MongoDB which you don't have.<p>That makes you want to _not_ have one JAR and then keep your fingers crossed that it is configured right. Optimally things should just work (tm) in production without any configuration. (Not to mention if you try to sell your software, you can not sell just one package because just by changing the configuration from delivery1 to delivery2 you get the second product for free.)<p>With dynamic languages what you presumably would want to do is just zip the right files and that's that (although you still need system tests that verify that the zip has the right stuff in it), but with static languages it's more tricky. One way to get that would be to have A-core.jar that has all code that is common to every installation, and then A-installation1.jar with the right delivery and plugs for the first installation, and A-installation2.jar for files for the second installation etc.. Because in the installation JARs there would be only one delivery, and only one plug per jack (and one jack per contract), things would work without any additional configuration.<p>Now the problem with Maven is that you can't easily get many JARs from one src/main/scala. Or can but things get complicated when start releasing stuff to repositories. Which results in the really messy directory structure I outlined above, or then you would have to figure out some other directory structure that would work better. Of course the best would be to hack Maven to work around the ""one JAR per src/main/scala"" limitation. Or write a maven-obvious-plugin. :)<p>The backstory here is that packaging tools easily mandate directory structure. Directory structure in turn directs source packages (inverted URL in Java), and source packages tend to influence the architecture.<p>The cool thing in Obvious is that by making the directory structure itself reflect the architecture, code is automatically steered towards good practices. Of course you can create a great code architecture with any directory structure, but in many cases _where_ you can put stuff, influence _what_ you put in there.<p>So in some cases, it's actually the supposedly trivial packaging of sources that is a culprit for bad decisions. Which IMO makes packaging also non-trivial from an architecture standpoint.",1357115264
4995815,comment,4994208,4995550,2,0,gruseom,,,"OK, I get you. The inline :WHEN in that FOR form makes me go ""what?"" as well. The syntax feels halfsie to me; it abandons regularity but doesn't want to go full mini-language a la LOOP, so it ends up in a syntactic no man's land. It doesn't feel very composable to me, either  does it scale to more complex expressions? I'm biased, though. The following seems far better to me; slightly lower-level, but clearer and more composable:<p><pre><code>  (loop for x in '(0 1 2 3 4 5) for y = (* x 3) when (evenp y) append\n    (loop for z in '(1 2) collect (list y z)))\n\n  => ((0 1) (0 2) (6 1) (6 2) (12 1) (12 2))\n</code></pre>\nThe reason why LOOP has keywords for all its loopy things is that the set ""stuff you often want to do while iterating"" is too varied to be supported by an entirely regular syntax. Of course it can all be done with the utilities of the underlying Lisp (which is all that LOOP expands to), but often not as concisely and especially not as idiomatically. I like crossing out of universal Lisp into Loopland to do those little plumbing jobs. Because LOOP is so limited and specific, I know why such a construct is there and can grok very quickly what I'm looking at and what it evaluates to. Having such forms stand out from the backdrop of the far more powerful language the main program is written in is a major clarity win. (Good god, I sound like someone arguing against Lisp syntax altogether!)<p>For the same reasons (concision, idiom, and clarity), forgive me but I don't like the monads/with-monad versions you've given. ""monads/with-monad monads/sequence-m"" is much too verbose  I want an operation this simple to be lightweight. It doesn't feel idiomatic to me for looping and pairing things, though that may just be my ignorance. And it feels like some powerful and general infrastructure is being invoked to do something whose triviality I would rather see the code bring out. Looping is the canonical example, I think, of something that one does so often and has such repetitive-yet-assorted patterns that a little language is perfect for the job. But I'm biased, as I said.<p>By the way, I've been puzzling over that FOR form trying to make out how it ends up producing a Cartesian product out of '(0 1 2 3 4 5) and '(1 2). In CL, if you make the bindings parallel like that, as in (loop for x in foo for y in bar...), it means ""take an x from foo and a y from bar and keep going as long as they're both producing new values"". So to get a Cartesian product, I had to make an explicit nested loop in my translation above. Both idioms are useful, but I use the parallel one quite a bit more than the nested one. Does FOR handle both?<p>p.s. You're missing a square bracket after [1 2]. I was puzzling even more before I realized that :)",1357115227

I feel transformed.<p>I find myself able to communicate with others in a more effective way; I can place my full attention on individuals and the conversation benefits as a result. I especially feel more connection to others.<p>I find my cognitive faculties sharpened since I am not in constant use of them; I feel as though they are well rested and are now under my control.<p>I find myself enjoying taste more; if I eat too fast, I must slow down so that I don't miss the experience.<p>I find tears of joy in my eyes when I listen to beautiful music; how could I have not noticed such beauty before?<p>Most importantly, I find myself able to simply feel; I have never been able to feel like I can feel now.",1357113851

This speaks more to a ""I am so rich and I made my money so easily that I don't care what I get taxed at"" attitude.<p><i>>Nothing the government agreed to in the last few days actually affects the asset wealthy in this country.</i><p>The increased tax rate on dividends and capital gains definitely affects the ""asset wealthy"" in the country. In fact, both the top income tax rate and the dividend/capital gains tax rate for those making over $400k has increased by roughly the same amount [1].<p>However, complete inaction by government would have increased the dividend tax rate even more, so that it would have been considered ordinary income (43.4% top rate) [2]. The legislation passed on 12/31 and 1/1 by Congress definitely <i>helped</i> the asset wealthy. Oracle pays a 18c dividend per share, and Larry Ellison owns roughly a billion Oracle shares. The dividend tax savings he'll receive from this legislation is massive.<p>[1] The top income tax rate goes from 35% to 43.4% (39.6% + 3.8% health care tax) and the top dividend/capgains tax rate goes from 15% to 23.8% (20% + 3.8% health care tax). If person A makes $100MM in salary and person B makes $100MM in dividend/capgains in 2013, their relative tax rate increase compared to 2012 is about the same: 8.4% increase vs 8.8% increase.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.atr.org/trillion-obamacare-tax-hike-hitting-jan-a7393"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atr.org/trillion-obamacare-tax-hike-hitting-jan-a...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-02/bipartisan-house-backs-tax-deal-vote-as-next-fight-looms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-02/bipartisan-house-ba...</a>",1357113759

For real web development anything other than javascript should be providing you with a massive benefit to offset the disadvantages of adding a build step to your workflow and having to debug in a language different to the language you're coding in.

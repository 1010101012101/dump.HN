633232,comment,632702,632702,0,0,thristian,,,"Some responses to various parts of the article:<p>""No easy_UNinstall"" - I'm one of the lucky few who has access to an extensive and sensible archive of easily installable and uninstallable Python library packages; I call it ""Ubuntu"". From what I can see, distutils is a good metadata format that helps real packagers like Debian and Ubuntu create real packages - but trying to write a cross-platform installer is just asking for trouble. Just unpack the package somewhere and set $PYTHONPATH in your startup scripts; that's what your startup scripts are for, anyway.<p>""rm -rf"" - my understanding is that the contents of the ""os"" stdlib package are a thin wrapper around POSIX, and rmdir(2) won't remove a non-empty directory either (although Zed says Python's rmdir will remove a directory with subdirectories, but not files... that's odd). ""shutil.rmtree"" isn't in POSIX, so it isn't in ""os"" either.<p>""Time Converstion"" - Zed says ""If all they did was give me the exact same POSIX C API Iâ€™d be happy."", but so far as I can tell, the 'time' stdlib module basically <i>is</i> the POSIX C API, with braindead awkwardness fully intact. I'll grant that ""calendar"" is stupid and ""datetime"" is crippled, although the third-party ""dateutil"" module fills a lot of the holes in ""datetime"". (also, for as long as I've known of it, mx.DateTime has been freely available)<p>""API Documentation Generation"" - It's not in the standard library, but I've been quite happy with the third-party tool ""epydoc"" for Python API doc generation, and it pretty much is as easy as ""epydoc path/to/package"" (and predates Sphinx and a lot of the other tools).<p>I have to agree with the rest of his examples, though - Python's had a long, rocky road from ""procedural Unix scripting language"" to ""Object-oriented, Internet service-providing language"", and although Python 3.0 has cleaned up a lot of the cruft there's still some oddness that remains (like the len function, or the del keyword). A lot of the standard-library crud has come from people saying 'here, I've found/written an 80% solution to this particular problem, let's put it in the standard library since it's better than the solution that's in there at the moment' rather than 'here's a problem, let's design a 90% or 95% solution for the standard library'.",1243654924

633226,comment,632374,632812,0,0,rue,,,"Well, here is the thing: <i>no, there does not have to be a reason</i>.<p>Nearly all of the problems ""accepting"" or understanding evolution stem from the mistaken assumption that evolution has ""goals"", or ""reasons"" or even that it is the ""survival of the fittest."" Essentially, from conceptualising it as an active force.<p>Mutations happen. Some will cause fewer offspring in the same genetic line, some will cause relatively more. Some just stick around because they are not actively harmful.<p>Your question has many facets: at its simplest, it could be asserted that the benefit outweighs the hazards. You are already making one assumption, though: that they are external because they need to be cooler than body temperature -- but that relationship could be inverse (and in my opinion actually makes more sense if it is.)

If you're using some not-too-powerful language to do it, it will take too long and you'll never catch up.  If you're using a language powerful enough to actually accomplish it, you'll never develop a community or a culture of libraries, because the number of people who feel they can just build what they need faster than learning and using someone else's library will be high enough that libraries never get enough attention, and you'll end up with an archipelago instead of a continent of libraries.

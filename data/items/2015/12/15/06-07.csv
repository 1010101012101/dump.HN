10736359,comment,10731415,10731415,0,0,sillyhealthcare,,,"This post is unrealistic in medicine, and really only works for less serious/elective care issues, not primary medicine, or where doctor and location choice actually matters.<p>As a starter: I&#x27;m woman with an extremely strong family history of breast cancer before age 50.  Standard clinical guidelines is to start doing heavy monitoring 5-10 years before the youngest person in the family tree was affected, since usually cases get progressively younger start dates.  Since one of the people was around age 32, I&#x27;m under the age of 30 and I go for mammograms, ultrasounds, and MRIs every year as if I were a cancer patient already.<p>Mammograms, ultrasounds, CAT Scans, MRIs, (any form of medical imaging radiography) are actually a perfect example of how the market internationally could be more efficient, but it turns out that&#x27;s impossible.  At its core we&#x27;re basically talking about photographs, something facebook manages to serve from location a to person b that is nowhere near location a every day.  Why couldn&#x27;t I go to any imaging place in the US, and have my images sent to the lowest cost provider somewhere in india to be read and interpreted by a radiologist, and then have the results sent back to me.  Unlike Chris, I don&#x27;t even have to meet my doctor, all I have to do is send him images.<p>It turns out that medically this is blatantly difficult if not impossible to do.  The reasons are 2 fold<p>1) It turns out that age and variations in how and why the machines that used, as well as technician speciality, matters a ton in image quality.<p><a href=""http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2010/09/mri-places-good-quality-machines-obsolete.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2010/09/mri-places-good-quality-...</a><p>As a patient, I have no idea if the price I am being quoted is reflected of image quality or price inflation (and this is before being read)<p>2)Quality of the radiology report is highly dependent on the MD reading the images.  This has been well studied since the early 2000s (one of the latest examples being here: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23737538"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23737538</a> )  At under the age of 50 with dense breasts, I&#x27;m significantly more likely to have imaging misread if I went into a community imaging location, even if they had top notch equipment, because the radiologists do not have enough volume of high risk cases to make sure I am not falling into false positives/recall on a regular basis - which would mean even more imaging costs.<p>In order to effectively export my images, I would have to find a way to duplicate part of the specialized cancer wing I go to.  Cost savings actually would be minimal - I&#x27;d be running more tests, seeing more doctors, and probably have a delayed diagnosis if/when my expected inevitable happens (which means more expensive drugs, longer treatment times, ect)<p>And while my example is specific to me, many people have similar sorts of conditions where treatment location, equipment used, and people involved have higher initial costs but lower lifetime costs for all sorts of conditions.  Pretty much any semi-serious disease falls into this category.<p>I&#x27;m game for better ways of paying (insurance does cover this, because as I said, lower lifetime costs to them by paying for preventive care).  I experiment with things like telemedicine - I use a compounding pharmacy and Specialized RN over the internet to manage acne that refuses to go away.  I&#x27;d totally go to the Caribbean for teeth whitening or LASIK.<p>None of these things need regular, serious followup, or run risks of painful drawn out deaths/longer painful medical care with much higher costs if done very incorrectly on a regular basis.<p>Medical tourism isn&#x27;t the answer - understanding what these services are in relationship to risk is.",1450162488

You go out to eat with coworkers you like, then you sit back and chat. The Japanese image of someone who&#x27;s really busy is someone who eats a lunch box or rice ball at his desk while working.<p>Edit: They&#x27;re sitting on the floor because they&#x27;re in a Japanese-style restaurant, so it&#x27;s easier to lean back on your elbows because there&#x27;s no chair.<p>> Staring into nothingness in Hakodate.<p>This guy isn&#x27;t staring off into nothingness because he&#x27;s depressed or so tired he can&#x27;t think; he&#x27;s smoking.

The word itself just means someone who works in an office. Imagine if you gave a single label to every full-time employee in an office in America -- that&#x27;s how it comes across when Western media uses it.<p>[2] Another popular &quot;exotic, overworked Japan&quot; meme that comes up is the fact that there&#x27;s a compound word (過労死, karoushi) for &quot;death by overwork.&quot; This is no more exciting than the fact that you can say &quot;death by overwork&quot; in English.",1450160474

10736269,comment,10731586,10734645,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"While I agree with a good deal of your argument I think a LOT has changed.<p>I have been flying all manner of R/C planes and helicopters for about thirty years.  I have planes that will do 120 MPH with the motor off, weigh in the order of 8 lbs and have a wingspan of 2.4 meters.  I have helicopters with 10,000 W power (peak) systems that come in at over 10 lbs.  I used to have model turbine jets that could rip across the sky at nearly 200 MPH.<p>What&#x27;s the difference?<p>The difference is that for as long as I can remember no model airplane hobbyist would even think about the idea of flying one of their aircraft anywhere near full scale aircraft, airports, around fire-fighting aircraft, over crowds, around buildings or at altitudes that could represent danger to full scale aircraft.<p>That is the difference.  And it is huge.<p>The other is the American Modelers Association (modelaircraft.org).  I have been a member for over 30 years.  Which, among other things, also means I carry a one million dollar insurance policy covering any damage I may cause while flying my aircraft.  My teenage son is an AMA member, he too is covered by a one million dollar policy.<p>In order for this insurance policy to provide coverage the modeler has to abide by AMA rules, which, among other things, requires you to fly at AMA sanctioned club locations.  Clubs, just like the one where I fly, are located such that model aircraft activity will not pose danger to people an property.  Clubs have rules beyond those of the AMA.  We have safety officers, etc.<p>Oh, yes, the AMA requires you to label your aircraft with your AMA member number, your name and contact information.  In other words, you are accountable for what you do.<p>You also needed training and skill to fly.  At most clubs you can&#x27;t just buy a plane and go flying, you have to be certified by the club instructor or established members or trained and then certified.<p>In other words, flying R/C aircraft has always had a degree of professionalism, care, consideration, responsibility and enough procedures and rules to not put anyone in danger.<p>What has changed, then, is that any moron can now buy a flying device that can be flown with almost no skill.  As you indicated, it is hard to fly some of these models in windy or gusty situations.  And that&#x27;s not necessarily because of the model.  I fly gliders in 50 MPH winds all the time.  I fly my R/C helicopters in gusty Santa Ana conditions all the time.  There&#x27;s a dedication to training and skill building that comes with the hobby.  Joe Quadcopter couldn&#x27;t give a shit.  He just wants to fly it over the beach and take pictures.  He has zero interest in becoming a good pilot.<p>The manufacturers could not give a crap about how they are used, therefore, they do not educate their customers at all.  And, of course, either out of ignorance or lack of caring, Mr. Joe Moron thinks nothing of taking his brand new DJI quadcopter up to 1,000 feet right above a park full of kids, neighborhood homes or the local news helicopter because, well, it&#x27;s cool, it has a &quot;return home&quot; feature and it is perfectly safe, physics be damned.<p>So, yeah, if you ask me, those morons need to be identified and they need to be made responsible for their actions.  Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to suck:  These morons are the very people who will absolutely, positively NOT register and absolutely, positively NOT have any ID or registration number on the machines they fly.  People like me, who have enjoyed the hobby for decades without placing anyone or anything at risk are the ones who end-up paying the price for the morons.<p>What I find really ironic is that this is EXACTLY, to the letter, the same scenario we have with guns.  Law abiding citizens never hurt a sole.  Criminals and crazies do.  And everyone ends-up paying for it with the exception of those who truly need to be kept away from them.<p>I am not necessarily bothered by the registration.  I am already 100% identified in every single one of my aircraft.  If I crash one anywhere, whoever picks it up will have my AMA membership number, name and phone number.  So, registering with the FAA is not a big deal.  What pisses me of is that, just like guns, this is going to do exactly ZERO to stop the crazies, morons and criminals.  Zero.",1450160373

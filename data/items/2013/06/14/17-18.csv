A 128 bit key is 2^128 or 3.4e38.<p>Numbers about total world computing power (most of it probably stuck in GPUs doing windows animations and playing Call of Duty) bandied about are in the Ne18ish ops/sec range, age of the universe is in the 4e17 range.<p>And I have a great deal of margin by treating a &#x27;decrypt and verify&#x27; operation as a &#x27;basic operation&#x27; and using a completely preposterous time period like the age of the universe instead of say, 10,000 years. Nobody is brute-forcing 128 bit keys anytime soon, that&#x27;s a pretty basic mathematical and physical given. But if you&#x27;re particularly paranoid, you can just as easily use 256 bit keys - nobody is brute-forcing those until we hit the singularity and become a galaxy-encompassing brain.

As for advancements in technology the answer is likely no - producing that technology requires an entire toolchain/industry that the NSA is unlikely to replicate with its size.  The only shot the NSA has at pulling ahead of us is with entirely mathematical things like crypto (which they did at least in the 70s with differential cryptanalysis).  With math you can simply hire a bunch of smart people and throw them in a room together which is much less capital intensive than the massive, fundamental research needed to advance technology ahead of the industry.",1371232731

Except it&#x27;s not that easy.<p>Let&#x27;s say that you&#x27;re using OTR to provide very strong end-to-end encryption for a conversation between yourself and a buddy, Bob. Maybe he&#x27;s in a hostile area, and you&#x27;re worried that if his government sniffs his traffic, that he could be executed for speaking to Americans.<p>Data in transit that is intercepted, if configured correctly, is almost certainly safe. No one will be able to immediately decrypt it because of the strong encryption.<p>So are you safe?<p>Probably not. The next step that government would take would be to raid your friend Bob&#x27;s apartment, arrest him, and take his hard disk. His OTR key (and, if using Pidgin, account credentials in plaintext if stored) is plainly available on the disk. You now have the private key.<p>But what if he used Truecrypt or PGP full-disk encryption? His data would be safe from decryption then, right?<p>Sort of. If they&#x27;re trying to break the <i>actual encryption,</i> they&#x27;d likely be unable to do so. Unfortunately, the weak point for Truecrypt disks or volumes isn&#x27;t the crypto... it&#x27;s the <i>passphrase.</i> The passphrase can be brute-forced <i>significantly</i> more easily than breaking the encryption itself. Furthermore, as xkcd so accurately pointed out, a hostile government will throw you in prison (or, worse, hit you repeatedly with a wrench) until you divulge your passphrase and data.<p>Encryption is great, and I encourage everyone to use reliably strong crypto. Will that keep your data safe from the criminals that stole your work laptop? Absolutely. Will it keep your data safe from the NSA? You&#x27;re kidding yourself.",1371232555

At the time, it wasn&#x27;t classified information; it was just something that nobody knew.  Approximately 15-20 years later, satellites with that capability became well-known.  This indicates to me that top secret technology is probably somewhere around 15-20 years ahead of what the general public knows about.  This may be less true today than it was back then since nowadays the equipment and factories to develop state-of-the-art technology run in the billions of dollars.<p>Where I&#x27;m going with this: is it reasonable to assume that &quot;future technology&quot; 20 years from now could crack AES-256 or PGP?  If so, it seems reasonable to me that the NSA could already crack today&#x27;s encryption for high-priority data.  Add that to the fact that they tend to hire the very best experts in the field (mathematicians and cryptographers) and it doesn&#x27;t seem entirely unreasonable to me that their decryption technologies are pretty good.  Of course, I&#x27;m not talking about better technology in a brute-force sense; it would still be impossible to crack 256-bit encryption.

Probably their biggest success has been raising the tax thresholds in a way that benefits many of the less well-off but working people in the country. And for all the current mess about mass surveillance, you have to remember that compulsory ID cards for everyone were being pushed strongly by the previous administration and have been scrapped since.<p>The trouble is, the Lib Dems have terrible PR people who haven&#x27;t played up their strengths to any significant extent at all, so they&#x27;ve just got lost in all the negative stories. They totally mishandled the tuition fees issue (at least, those of their MPs who didn&#x27;t rebel did) and that cost them dearly, because they lost the credibility they so desperately needed to get things done in government and they&#x27;ve been playing defence ever since. Add in a couple of scandals costing Cabinet-level people their jobs, throw in this Lord Carlile guy that no-one had ever heard of until he became the Lib Dems&#x27; chief apologist for anything not really very liberal at all and Vince Cable as possibly the most overtly business-hostile Business Secretary in recorded history, and their top brass is looking more like a bunch of school kids playing at government than senior members of an actual national government. This in turn just plays into probably the Lib Dems&#x27; biggest PR problem coming into government, which was convincing people that all those nice-sounding policies they were free to advocate when they had no chance of winning the election could actually work for real.<p>As a point of interest, we were within a few metaphorical steps of &quot;Papers please&quot; on ID cards and it really was popular revolt that forced the political class to roll it back, so I&#x27;m not ruling out that significant public backlash you mentioned against the on-line surveillance. Almost everyone uses Facebook and Google, but a lot of people don&#x27;t really like them very much, particularly the constant invasions of privacy, and I suspect a lot of people are getting fed up with the US overtly throwing its weight around one way or another too. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine that this could become an issue with significant weight by election time unless it&#x27;s all water under the bridge by then, and I don&#x27;t see any chance of that happening if anyone in government really does try to force through the snooper&#x27;s charter.

A better statement is that &quot;Libertarians are right of Right and left of Left&quot;.  So depending on your existing world-view, you would probably see the Libertarians as either radically Leftist or radically Rightist, and - in either case - you&#x27;d be partially correct and partially wrong.<p>For example, Libertarians align with the left, and would go further than the standard American Left on many social issues:<p>Abortion - Libertarians tend to be pro-choice and the LP platform specifically says that the State should not be involved in making those decisions.<p>Drug laws - a typical American &quot;Leftist&quot; position might be &quot;legalize marijuana&quot;.  A Libertarian position would be more like &quot;The State has no authority whatsoever to regulate what you put into your own body. End ALL drug laws&quot;.<p>Death Penalty - Libertarians are generally opposed to the death penalty.<p>Gay marriage / minority rights - Libertarians believe the Govt. should have no say in marriage at all, which implies that homosexual couples should be able to marry if they want.  Of course, it also implies that others should be free to choose not to recognize that marriage, but hey... that&#x27;s the price of freedom: You want to be free, you can&#x27;t compel other people to behave the way you want them to.<p>OTOH, yes, Libertarians tend to be more closely aligned with &quot;the Right&quot; on economic issues: taxation, trade, business regulation, etc.  But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to call the Libertarian movement &quot;an extreme right wing movement&quot;.

In production, the URL will come from somewhere, not written by hand, so it would need to be checked anyway. Sadly there&#x27;s no quick-prototyping mode in Java where you can say, just call this URL string an don&#x27;t bother checking.\nAnother example is the inability to just read a local file into a string with a simple API call. It&#x27;s this way, again, because in production the program has to reason about paths and file systems and can&#x27;t make assumptions about the validity (or size) of the file you just want to load and play with.<p>In production code, no matter the language, you have to guard against these issues. The nice thing about typed objects (immutable, anyway), is that once constructed and validated, they do not require tedious validation at every method and client they are passed into. That actually results in less boilerplate, and less test writing.<p>So just remember, Java always assumes your code is production-bound and requires upfront planning and checking.

A single zipcode is just a collection of USPS postal routes; nothing more, nothing less.  They don&#x27;t have to be contained within a single city, or even a single state, nor do they have to be contiguous, and they can overlap with one another.  New ones are also added all the time, and no publicly available databases of them handle any of these problems well.  Most applications that try to use them for anything end up running across edge cases that show users incorrect data, often without ever realizing it.  It&#x27;s especially unfortunate because so many startup-y people live in urban areas where zipcodes cover small, regular geographic areas, and have no idea they&#x27;re potentially creating terrible user experiences for people who live elsewhere.<p>For a particular case study of sorts, see: <a href=""http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/01/19/dont-use-zipcodes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/01/19/dont-use-zipco...</a>",1371231050

Realistically, my understanding is that they are essentially using Vanguard ETFs. Their trick is that they actively manage your portfolio. If you are willing to spend the time to constantly rebalance your holdings (and have a good knowledge of ETF betas so you choose them correctly from the outset), then it is definitely better for you to do it yourself. The fact is that most people don&#x27;t do this -- I know I won&#x27;t. Not rebalancing can have a MAJOR negative effect long term on your portfolio, so I would rather be guaranteed to give up a small percent of returns than have exposure to future economic/market downturns as I get older.",1371230458

CenturyLink is the world&#x27;s 3rd largest telco. They provide fiber-based networks to businesses around the world. A year ago, CenturyLink acquired Savvis and entered the IaaS cloud space. Savvis has a global presence with more than 50 data centers across North America, EMEA and Asia. Now they have doubled down on cloud and entered the PaaS space by buying AppFog. Go to http://www.appfog.com/savvis/faq<p>AppFog will continue business as usual with substantially more investments into our product, support, operations and community. We will continue to have free as well as paid offerings without any change to the service as you know and love it. We will add more infrastructure options, increase our support operations and accelerated launches of new features. We will soon be adding high-speed Savvis infrastructure options for deploying applications.<p>CenturyLink is a great partner to accelerate our business efforts. Fiber Networks + IaaS + PaaS = Awesome. As you need to scale to infrastructure larger than AppFog currently supports, Savvis will be able to provide dedicated virtual machines on demand with great performance and reliability.<p>Most importantly, CenturyLink shares the core values of support, honesty and dedication that have made AppFog community so great over these years.<p>I am incredibly excited to continue this journey with you. I know many of you have been waiting for a long time for AppFog to get a few key features out the door, thank you for your patience! I believe this is the catalyst to making that happen, we are doubling down our investment to making AppFog the world&#x27;s leading PaaS. Thanks again for continuing to be an AppFog user!

In our first past the post voting system, not having an (R) or (D) next to your name basically ensures you&#x27;ll not get elected, so you have to caucus with one of those parties. Your only concern is about which one.<p>Now, given that, it makes sense to target the Republican party. The party is in a period of disunity, and as a natural tendency Republicans are more amenable to arguments based on distrust of government. Democrats will oppose government when they dislike negative effects that they can see actually happening (e.g. as the Iraq war dragged on), but arguments along the lines of &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t trust government with these powers, even if you can&#x27;t see the negative effects yet&quot; work better on Republicans.<p>Moreover, people don&#x27;t care about &quot;privacy.&quot; Abstract arguments about &quot;privacy&quot; aren&#x27;t going to get votes. You have to put those abstract arguments in concrete terms that people understand and that relate to things they care about. Paint the issue as giving the liberal administration the ability to snoop on conservative political organizations (&quot;Obama is reading the Tea Party&#x27;s e-mails!&quot;). Paint the issue as secularists being able to snoop on religious organizations (&quot;Obama is reading your church&#x27;s e-mails!&quot;). Figure out how to tie it to something Biblical and you&#x27;re cooking with fire.<p>This is not a cynical argument, by the way. The whole reason to be worried about surveillance is because of its chilling effect on freedom of political assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, etc. &quot;Obama is reading your cypherpunk IRC logs!&quot; would resonate with a lot of people on HN--but ordinary people don&#x27;t care about cypherpunks or pirates or groups like that. But there are groups they care about. The chilling effect of surveillance impacts cypherpunks and pirates and anti-abortionists and religious fundamentalists alike. If you don&#x27;t caucus with those groups, you&#x27;ll never establish a coalition large enough to have any political impact.",1371229837

Something like score voting, approval voting, or instant runoff voting is needed to break the deadlock.<p>Approval voting is probably the best bet because people who want to support a third party candidate could also vote for the first or second party who is closest to their position.

5880984,comment,5880317,5880317,11,0,gee_totes,,,"Ok, so I strongly disagree that the raid was part of a deal to film The Hobbit. It would imply some extremely poor negotiation on Warner Brother&#x27;s part since the raid happened AFTER production had moved from New Zealand. If Dotcom was really such a big deal to WB, why not make filming contingent on him being raided?<p>Yes, there was a big brew-ha-ha around moving the production of the Hobbit offshore (from NZ). But that was due to negoations falling apart with the New Zealand actor&#x27;s union[0][1]. This is the dispute that lead to negotiations with NZ&#x27;s prime minister on 27 October 2010[2]. These negations take place <i>after</i> the film was greenlit and Peter Jackson (not Guillermo Del Toro) is confirmed as director.<p>The result of these negotiations is that film workers in NZ loose their right to organize.<p>Now if I were Warner Brothers, and had actually made this deal to have the government raid Kim Dotcom in exchange for filming The Hobbit, wouldn&#x27;t I wait until the raid happened before starting filming to make sure that New Zealand holds up their end of the bargain?<p>But, in fact, principal photography on the Hobbit begins on 21 March 2011. Dotcom is raided 9 months later, in January 2012. By this time, all photography in New Zealand is finished.<p>This timeline doesn&#x27;t add up. What guarantee did Warner Brothers have that New Zealand would hold up their end of the bargain?<p>Furthermore, there&#x27;s no mention of this deal in the e-mails and memos that were released around the Hobbit filming negotiations in February 2013[3].<p>[0]<a href=""http://screenrant.com/the-hobbit-new-zealand-peter-jackson-kofi-83734/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://screenrant.com/the-hobbit-new-zealand-peter-jackson-k...</a>\n[1]<a href=""http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10682024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&o...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(film_series)#Industrial_dispute_in_New_Zealand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(film_series)#Indust...</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://www.3news.co.nz/Hobbit-files-released/tabid/1607/articleID/288190/Default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.3news.co.nz/Hobbit-files-released/tabid/1607/arti...</a>",1371229239

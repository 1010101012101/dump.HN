Carve out your areas of incompetence:  There was some debate about the downside of such a principle (ie: young girls jumping quickly to say ""I'm bad at math"" when they might have a tremendous, although dormant, capacity for mathematics) but overall there are some apparent benefits to this practice.  One tangible example was given of a consultant who joined some firm and, rather than follow suit with his colleagues and claim he could handle any of the potential tasks thrown his way, he chose to be very upfront, to carve out his areas of incompetence, and tell the people he worked with exactly what he wasn't good at.

1188942,comment,1188009,1188391,0,0,SeamusBrady,,,"- ""I would call earthquakes and smallpox evil.""<p>Ah, that you see is the challenge of Stoicism. A Stoic does not believe that there is anything evil in nature, impersonal perhaps, but not bad. There is nothing evil about death, earthquakes, viruses or asteroids. They just do their thing and sometimes happen to go against human interests. This does not make them evil.<p>This is a difficult way to think at first, but it makes sense to me. Stand out under the stars and look up. Take a look at the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra_Deep_Field"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra_Deep_Field</a>). The universe is just so much bigger than me, so much bigger than my species. Why would I be surprised that it does not always operate directly in my interests?<p>Think about an ant in a busy railway station. If she gets trod on, does that make the commuter evil, or just indifferent to the ant's interests?<p>That is one of the lessons I have learned from observing nature. The complete absence of self pity, ruthlessly so.<p>The short poem 'Self Pity' by DH Lawrence illustrates this well:<p>""I never saw a wild thing<p>sorry for itself.<p>A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough<p>without ever having felt sorry for itself.""",1268491635

Likewise, if a search reveals nothing, one need simply press return to create a note with the appropriate title.<p>If a note's title starts with the search term(s), that title will be ""auto-completed"". This selects the note and consequently displays it.

1188923,comment,1188881,1188881,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Obviously Android is growing, but this rhetorical trick to make the growth look RIDICULOUS is... ridiculous.<p>I'm not sure why this analysis stopped in October 2009. Why not go back to October 2008? Then the stats would look something like this:<p><pre><code>  all other phones:\n    sales in October 2008: finite\n    sales in Jan 2010: larger\n    percentage increase: big\n\n  Android phones:\n    sales in October 2008: zero\n    sales in Jan 2010: large\n    percentage increase: INFINITY!!!\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, I assert that one big reason why Android has grown so fast since ""the three month period ending in October 2009"" is that before then there was only one or two Android phones, they were all from HTC, as I remember they were rather poorly marketed, and as a result they sold modestly but not spectacularly. When you're down that far, there's a lot of upside potential.<p>Take a look at this chart:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Android_devices"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Android_devices</a><p>What you will see is that the bulk of Android-powered devices, including the ones with the big popularity and big press from Motorola and (of course) Google itself, all came out after October 2009.<p>Cherry-picking certain parts of the sales growth curve and then extrapolating them to infinity does not add additional information. Take the data for what it is: The newest Android-powered devices are selling much, much better than the old; Apple's three-year-old iPhone platform has reached a marketshare plateau (not astonishing: three years is a long time in the phone market; unlike Android the iPhone OS is only available on a few types of device from one vendor; and in many markets the iPhone is chained firmly to specific telecom vendors, as Bay Area AT&T customers know all too well). Meanwhile, it sure is nice to be RIM, Microsoft's marketshare is doing about what everyone expected, and, well, it's really too bad about Palm.<p>EDIT: Oh, wait, these are <i>smartphone subscriber</i> stats. As such they probably don't include Apple's iPod Touch or other non-phone devices. (e.g. Does the Nook count?) When judging the installed base of the <i>software platforms</i>, rather than the size of various markets for cellphone minutes, this is a big omission, since Apple is known to do a huge iPod Touch business.",1268490588
1188922,comment,1188859,1188876,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Thanks very much for the links, I haven't seen most of them.<p>In my opinion, upvotes should be used to promote any comment that provides a unique or underconsidered point-of-view on the topic at hand, to indicate enthusiastic agreement, or to encourage users. For instance, if someone posts a comment that says what I would have said if they had not said it, I upvote it, because I enthusiastically agree and that user has saved me the time I would have spent typing it out, and usually introduced an element I hadn't considered. Or, if a user has posted a thoughtful comment with a divergent take from the rest of the group, even if I don't agree or don't care, I will often upvote that because it will get people thinking and hopefully generate good discussion. I will also upvote comments that have caused me to reconsider an opinion, or that make a point I hadn't yet considered. Those comments expand my mind and experience, and are good.<p>I find myself upvoting a lot of things I otherwise wouldn't upvote recently, primarily because I don't think the comment is worthy of downvotes it has received. For instance, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1188846"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1188846</a> is the comment that pushed me over on posting this, and it had a score of zero when I found it. I didn't find it particularly useful or insightful, and I didn't really have much opinion on its content, but I didn't think it deserved a downvote, and I upvoted it to get it back up to 1.<p>I try to reserve my downvotes for lines of thought or discussion that are either useless or actively damaging to the community.

Chances are you can run some flavour of Unix on your watch. Or toaster.<p>Salvation comes from understanding the system and making it work for you. Merely downloading it is not enough. Unix is user friendly, it's just very picky about who its friends are.<p>> > To make the system work you need to interpret the program yourself<p>> No way. Running most programs is a point-and-click business. On any modern Unix (such as Solaris, Debian or Fedora), installing a programs is a point-and-click, very app-storish thing.<p>> Without the DRM part, of course.<p>Configure, Make, Make Install. Remember, this was written in 1994, when point-and-click was still very alien to Unix.<p>(all in good fun, of course)",1268489153

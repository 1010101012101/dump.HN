Amazon India isn&#x27;t a bunch of white people from Seattle arriving en masse and setting up shop. They hired locally (including from Indian incumbents) and localized their operations to include stuff like COD, local language support etc. Amazon is well on its way to becoming as &#x27;local&#x27; as McDonalds or Honda have already. Their capability to deliver in Tier II and III cities is already ahead of Flipkart for example. GMV is currently about 35% of Flipkart and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they overtook them in two years.",1412668477

The nodes are called &quot;bolts&quot; and the edges are called spouts&quot;<p>Not really. Edges are streams and nodes are either spouts or bolts. Spouts have no predecessors and inject external data into the system. Bolts gather one or more input streams and produce zero or more output streams.<p>These names are a bit confusing, but only during the very first steps of a project. Quickly every developers grasp the concepts.<p>I have nevertheless a concern regarding spouts and bolts. In practice, when a topology is refactored, bolts have frequently to be transformed into spouts. This occurs when a topology is split in two to ease deployment; and when a persistent queue is added along a stream. This highlights that the distinction between spouts and bolts is bit artificial.",1412668438

Several years ago we decided to build an amazing trip planning, that allowed you to plan your trip day-by-day.

Just 5% of our users used it.<p>So because we were a startup we decided to kill it and we focused on capturing user wishes, and recommending those things for their trips (kind of Google Now for trips and offline). That&#x27;s what gave us more usage, more income and finally it was one of the reasons of our exit.<p>So, yes. Trip planning sucks as a business. But all our team remembers it proudly.

I looked at count of his answers, length of average answer and estimated that he must have spent 4hr per day each working day for past 4+ year to get that many points.<p>That&#x27;s interesting.Doesn&#x27;t this defeat the very purpose of having reputation points mentioned in CV?<p>> This was on minimum side. If you convert this to hourly rate, it&#x27;s same as he donated about half a million to StackOverflow.<p>So that&#x27;s how this so-called zero-sum-game looks but its more driven by priorities than perspective.We don&#x27;t know how many people were saved from excess time and energy spent on understanding the same because of one persons generosity.<p>>Now if you can upvote this answer, that would be great ;)<p>wish i could do it twice :)",1412666889

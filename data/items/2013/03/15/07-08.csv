You're coming from this imagined position that you deserve license to others' work on your terms at your price. The companies offering media with DRM for sale on the market have no such delusion that they have an innate right your money; they're OK with you not taking their offer. That's fine, since the value proposition is suitable to millions of others who will make the purchase on the terms offered -- watching a movie today is still worth some number of dollars even if you might not be able to dust it off 20 years from now to watch again. They're not OK with you infringing their rights to their property instead of declining the offer. But really, your moral and ethical compass won't be turned by logic or debate.",1363334371

Android was more flexible and could address more users.</i><p>More users, but not more users that really matter. That is, more users that generate more profits. Hence the difference between Samsung and Apple. It's similar to how Apple can have ten times the profit of Dell even if Dell ships twice the units.<p>The Android companies are like the PC companies: they have a commoditized OS and sell to all tiers, low and high, but mostly low and mid, and for smaller margins. Apple only sells to the higher end of the market, as they always did with their laptops and desktops.<p>><i>Now it may well be that Apple doesn't care about this at all. But please do not make arguments how technically Apple never led in the smartphone market.</i><p>Smartphone? I thought you meant ""mobile phone with touch UI and great web browser"".<p>Which is BS btw. Apple made a smartphone. Competing with entrenched smartphones. The fact that none (or few) shared it's design and particular qualities at the time means nothing.<p>In the smartphone market (which is a real market segment, instead of the ""mobile phone with touch UI and great web browser"" which is an ad-hoc thing you came up with), the iPhone was never top in market share. It was however top (and still is) in profits.<p>Apple does not care about the lower end (or total market share) for the iPhone. They care for the same things they do in their PC department: capturing the upper end, the more expensive, better margins and more headroom for build quality, end of the market.<p>That's why you have Android users be 3-1 to iOS users but iOS users still are 80% of those actively web browsing from their mobiles. Because beside the ""tech-enthusiasts that don't like Apple"" (a small-ish market) Android also caters to the lower end of the market, people who could not care less about mobile browsing or ""computer-like phones"", and just use it as a glorified phone that they get for free with their low-tier subscription.",1363334011

They created a new experience and that experience became necessary to sell advanced phones.  The article talks about how apple pioneered the 'more computer than phone' over the 'more phone than computer'.  That's nonsense revisionist history, there were plenty of 'more computer than phones' out there years before and the iphone was significantly behind some of them in terms of computer-like behaviour.  What Apple did was create a swipe friendly experience that became mandatory.  What 'smartphone' <i>meant</i> changed dramatically, to the extent that people don't classify phones that can run apps, browse the web, play mp3s, ssh into servers, etc as smart phones these days unless they have a swipe friendly UI.<p>To be honest though, I find the whole article pointless. I don't care about whether the media is using the wrong metric to call winners and losers in the 'smartphone' market.  I'm not really interested in the media's view on this matter.

Everything he wrote rings true to me, and nothing is off. Yet, I never had the slightest problem in sticking to, and finalizing my degree, nor disliking my work or profession. In fact, the parts where I have found myself procrastinating the most, is when setting out to do my own pet projects, the ones I would LOVE to do. And why is that?

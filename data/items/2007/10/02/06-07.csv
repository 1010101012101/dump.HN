61972,comment,61901,61901,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"pg has a deeply felt longing for brevity.  Our application, which did get us to the interview, was long, as I tend to chatter on quite a bit more than strictly necessary--I feel the engineers compulsion to cover all of the caveats and interesting (to me) details--but I don't think that helped our case.  You should fight the urge to chatter on.<p>Think about the following questions:<p>What are you going to build?<p>Why should we believe you are willing and able to build it?<p>Everything else is fluff...so, for every sentence you write, think, ""Does this answer one of those two questions?""  If not, cut it.  That's pretty much what all of the questions on the application are about--they just want to hear it from multiple angles.",1191307191

61970,comment,61901,61901,0,0,sgoraya,,,"After my first visit with a VC last week, and inline with a lot of the advice already given, the point the gentleman stressed was having a concise and tight pitch/overview document.  <p>\nThe verbose application/business plan can wait until the VC is actually interested in your company and requests a more detailed plan.  (not to say that you should wait until the last minute to draft your BP though)   ",1191307125
61969,comment,61762,61816,0,0,neilk,,,"That's an interesting point. But... I'm someone who came from an arts degree and sort of turned myself into a reasonable facsimile of an engineer. I personally regret not having done things the other way round.<p>The problem with arts degrees is that very few people end up doing what they originally wanted to do. Most of the journalism grads are going to end up in PR, or something even less related to what they supposedly studied. <p>So yeah, one might be more content if one had the talent and passion and stuck with the dream. But so many people don't and that's a ticket to a midlife crisis.",1191307087

61965,comment,61762,61902,0,0,neilk,,,"Unfortunately, he's right.<p>This isn't so much because engineering is great, or the only way to make your mark on the world. The problem is that today's arts faculties just suck. It's possible to graduate  knowing things that <i>only</i> matter within the walls of the university, and you may not realize this until the very last minute.<p>That said, it's possible to graduate from engineering schools and not have a clue about history, current events, different sorts of people, what matters in life, and the fact that one cannot wear socks with sandals. You may not be starving, and you may be in a sense contributing to society more than many artists, but you may never have really stretched your own mind -- merely let your geek tendencies do their thing.<p>I think the best possible thing to do in university is to take the hard science courses, and then supplement them with intense and challenging arts courses. The ones where you have to do learn some serious art history, or do some sort of performance. This is the best of both worlds.",1191306265

61962,comment,61762,61834,0,0,auferstehung,,,"Marc is telling it like it is, even if it is a little difficult to hear.<p>A Ph.D. is a huge opportunity cost with an extraordinarily high risk/reward ratio.  I have often had undergraduates ask me if they should pursue a Ph.D.  I first ask them if it is their desire to teach at a research university.  This desire is a little like becoming an NBA player especially in certain technical fields like physics.  A horde of Ph.D. candidates is good for tenured Professors and research universities, but not necessarily for the students.  Post-doc hell is left as an excercise for the reader.<p>If they don't have a burning desire  to be a professor or happen to dislike trees,  I don't really see the point of a Ph.D.  I tell them to at least take a hard look at the costs of their decision either way: real financial, opportunity, time, etc.  An objective tally will rarely be in favor of a Ph.D. ",1191305226

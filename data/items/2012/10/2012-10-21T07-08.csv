David Rusenko (Weebly) was still in college when he and his buds started. So to me it seems like college boys dominate. And the kinds of technically oriented women that would be interested in Startup School aren't as interested in hanging around with a bunch of drunk college kids where there are not that many women.<p>Id be curious if the gap was smaller watching the webcasts?",1350806081
4679245,comment,4678363,4679062,1,0,gilgoomesh,,,"No, I don't have data. I'm running off memory from when I worked at a printing and display company (8 years ago so memory could be faulty).<p>The point is actually related to the way your eye adjusts to ambient brightness levels. It's not about the contrast on its own but about the contrast, the number of brightness levels of the display and the brightness level with respect to the ambient conditions.<p>The rule of thumb was that less than 300:1 starts to cause eye strain on an 8 bits per channel (256 levels) gamma power curve (non-linear) device when the device had a limited maximum brightness output (for LCDs at the time that was 200cd/m^2) and the room was bright (for an office).<p>Kindles are 4 bits per channel (16 levels) linear and their contrast ratio isn't a complete lie (unlike most LCD makers contrast ratios who report only the absolute best case). But that's not the biggest reason why they're different. Kindles don't emit light, they reflect it (not including the Kindle White and Fire). This means that they maintain their brightness level with respect to the environment much better.<p>Of course, Kindles start to suffer at <i>low</i> light (for similar reasons -- they lose their apparent contrast level).",1350806046

India was never industrialized, So, even if innovation occurs, it never becomes part of the industrial-government machinery.

The only connecting fabric underlying india is its spiritually, beliefs and traditions ( Hindu/Vedic traditions ). Their lifestyle is very different from industrialized west or terror based middle east. India itself has two major kinds of people, city folks who are westernized and rural folks who are relatively non-westernized. depending on who you talk, you may get a different answer.<p>Anyway, this is great question.

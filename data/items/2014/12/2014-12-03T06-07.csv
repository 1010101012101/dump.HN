But there is one good reason why that happens - OPT.<p>Foreign students graduate out of US schools and join companies here and work legally by enrolling in the OPT program that can last upto 28 months. During this time, the only way the company can hire them full-time is through the H1B program. The whole charade with creating these oddly specific ads and posting them where no one can see them is because there is no other way to continue employing the same people.<p>The same thing is repeated as part of PERM because the company is supposed to post an ad to hire someone for a job to make sure no one local is available, but that person has already been hired!",1417589799

8692235,comment,8690206,8691218,0,0,gioele,,,"Interesting, this is similar to the discussion going on for &quot;int&quot; in Rust (or the exact opposite, depending on how you view it). [1, 2]<p>One the one hand &quot;implicit int&quot; are being phased out in favour of explicit int size. Your variables cannot be `int` anymore, you have to sit down, think and choose: u8? u16? u32? i32? u64? i64? This avoids all the pains of programs behaving differently or crashing when compiled on different architectures.<p>On the other hand, a new &quot;native integer for sizes that do not matter, minimum 32 bits&quot; is being brewed, for example for pointer offsets or collection sizes. The idea is that you will not be able to have a collection with more of 2^32 elements in a 32-bit architecture nor more than 2^64 in a 64-bit architecture.<p>After this discussion, my hope is to see the introduction of a fast-ish dynamic bigint (that starts native and grow up to 256 or 512 bits) that can be used in all the cases where you do not care about the exact size type, yet you want to be future-proof (this `private int index` fits this case, IMO).<p>[1] <a href=""http://discuss.rust-lang.org/t/if-int-has-the-wrong-size/454/23"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discuss.rust-lang.org/t/if-int-has-the-wrong-size/454...</a>

And you still need some organization that certifies that you know what you claim you know. Medicine is an obvious example. Engineering is another. No-one would like to live in a tall building made by somebody who claims to know how to build tall buildings, but didn&#x27;t go to college.<p>I bet not many pharmaceutical companies would like to hire someone without a degree to design a new drug. Regulations, insurance, credibility, lots of problems.<p>> Getting ahead in life by going to college is a dying notion.<p>So, yes... you can earn a lot of money without a degree, but if you want to work in some areas that need a degree, you must go to college.<p>And I see that with my sister today. She&#x27;s 2 years older than me. She left university after 3 years, went to live to another country for 6 years,  and came back with no money. She worked there, but spent a lot living large, having fun and enjoying her twenties. Meanwhile, I studied and worked (to pay my studies)..<p>Now, I earn almost 4 times what she earns. And it&#x27;s difficult to her to find a job that she likes. She tried having her own business, and burned all of her savings. She started studying again, realizing that without a career, she&#x27;s going to have a really hard professional future.<p>I know that the choices we both made are based on very different philosophies. She prioritized enjoying her youth, and that&#x27;s OK. I prioritized investing in my future, and that&#x27;s OK too.<p>But a formal education, is still a great tool to help you in your professional life, even when you can learn all by yourself.",1417589578

8692213,comment,8687804,8690053,0,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,">Proper average market salary and inflated market salary are two different things<p>I don&#x27;t think you can have &quot;inflated market salary.&quot; Instead what you have is the <i>true</i> market salary (for an experienced engineer that&#x27;s good, that&#x27;s a minimum of $200k at this point), and then you have the amount that most companies are willing to pay (which typically caps at $125-150k).<p>In the US, until the 1970s, average income (in constant dollars) rose at a pretty compelling rate. After the 1970s, a number of factors have combined such that we&#x27;ve not seen the same rise in real income -- despite the fact that <i>productivity</i>, as in, the amount of <i>value</i> we&#x27;re adding to companies&#x27; bottom lines, has been rising.<p>This is why the gap between the rich and the rest has been growing so quickly. The added productivity is enriching the few at the expense of the many, except for a <i>very few</i> exceptions; one of those is exceptional software developers, who can take advantage (at the moment) of their rarity to actually negotiate salaries commensurate with their productivity.<p>I&#x27;m one of those who was able to secure a $250k+ offer from a big company, which is awesome, and I&#x27;m really lucky to be in this position. But the reality is that I know a lot of developers who are really good and who should be making over $200k/year, at a minimum, but who make $125k or less.<p>Importing H1-B workers in large quantities keeps those salaries lower than they should be. Instead companies need to raise compensation to keep up with demand. Maybe it means they can only afford half as many developers, but they&#x27;re likely better off with fewer good developers anyway. :)",1417589061

I have several pieces of equipment with balanced connections, but only a minority of the balanced connections are XLR.  Most are TRS.<p>I think you are using a different definition of &quot;noise&quot;.  &quot;Noise&quot; is unwanted sound.<p>The GSM noise you hear is caused by demodulation of GSM radio, in the 800-900 MHz range.  At these frequencies, even a very small wire works well as an antenna.  For example, an 8 cm wire makes a quarter-wave antenna.  In my experience, there is often a trace of at least 8 cm within an amplifier or monitor which picks up the signal.  In these cases, balanced connections do not help.  The nonliniarities in semiconductor components then demodulates the GSM signal into the audio band.  The worst offenders at picking up GSM interference are cheap amplifiers and radios.  Good equipment is well shielded and doesn&#x27;t suffer from radio interference, and in my experience, using unbalanced connections over short distances (1-2 meters) won&#x27;t change that.<p>Balanced connections fix ground loops and let you run cables over long distances.

I don&#x27;t think anybody&#x27;s proven that the overtones of notes below 20khz are unimportant, or that the ear doesn&#x27;t use edge detection for example to determine phase differences for location determination. These would require faithful reproduction beyond 20khz.<p>Also to clarify a technical point, sampling at 192khz doesn&#x27;t extend the frequency response to 192khz, it only extends it to 96khz (Nyquist in action).",1417586797

All but the last are doing OOP badly -- but any paradigm can be done badly.<p>The last is <i>not</i> OOP, though its something that can be done in most OO languages. OTOH, there&#x27;s no real reason to oppose it other than OO fundamentalism -- an object or class that contains only behavior and not state may not be really an example of OOP, but its not a &quot;Con&quot; of OOP, its just a manner in which modules as found in many procedural/functional languages can be implemented in some languages where OOP is the paradigm from which the primary syntactic structures are drawn.",1417586777

&quot;My own feeling is that object-oriented programming is a useful technique in some cases, but it isn&#x27;t something that has to pervade every program you write. You should be able to define new types, but you shouldn&#x27;t have to express every program as the definition of new types.&quot;",1417586636

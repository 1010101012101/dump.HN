Marriage is a human decision and we are known for making mistakes, aren't we? And if we did make a mistake, we have to rectify it or try to rectify it.<p>Over the time, the increase in divorce rate has has a lot to do with (personal) freedom, education and exposure especially of women; and not to the mention the era of women-emancipation and after.<p>Each period in the article correlates with women's status in society at the time, and is mentioned in there.<p>It would be interesting to know what were the % of divorces where women initiated it(it's recorded, right?).",1365004790

George Lakoff has and others from cognative semantics provide strongly supporting views from linguistics.<p>And in Machine Learning, Deep Learning is now providing new support for these views on analogy. This isn't immediately obvious until realizing that analogy is not necessarily an active process more likely a passive result of how thoughts and memories are encoded and stored. I'm curious as to whether Hofstadter will address this in this book - I would imagine so as he was long ago excited by earlier similar ML approaches (Sparse Distributed Memory).",1365004768

In what way is e^i*pi = -1 a metaphor for anything?  What role does analogy play in this idea?<p>Looking back, I am open to the fact that mathematicians use analogy to come up with their ideas (but perhaps not metaphor, which seems essentially literary)  Mathematics is funny because it is presented in ""reverse"", i.e. not the way it was derived.<p>Anyway I will have to read it, although I am slightly skeptical of ideas that try to explain ""everything"".  In retrospect Taleb's Antifragile had some of that flavor, although I thought it was very good.<p>EDIT: I think it's probably accurate to say that the brain is fundamentally an association machine. Analogies are a form of association, but not all associations are analogies.

When a currency is supported by a government that government has some degree of control over that currency and that government, if it is democratic, can act on the currency based on the will of the people. (Obviously we could get into a big debate about oligarchs undermining democracy, etc, but let's skip that for now.)<p>If a currency like Bitcoin is adopted by too large a population of a given country and becomes a de facto currency it wrestles the fiat currency out of its position and eliminates any democratic control over currencies.<p>I understand that there are many, many hard-money libertarian types around here who see this and cry, ""yes! freedom!"" but my understanding of the scholarship on this sort of thing is that fiat currencies are very important for economic adjustments due to shocks. The Euro is showing us what a hard-money environment looks like as a natural experiment for Spain and Greece and it is not going well.<p>If I am an asset-holder I am a big fan of ensuring that devaluation can't take my riches away but if I am a technocrat trying to build a functioning economy for the long term that can deal will all sort of unexpected events and treat people without assets fairly I want a fiat currency. To me this is where the nihilism comes in, or at least Bitcoin represents an ""I got mine Jack"" view of the economy. That being said, now it is here and if it gain acceptance the world is going to need to deal with it.

(As for the content: It's bogus mainly because they're at best pseudo-anonymous, or rather: Actual anonymous payment via bitcoin takes a lot of effort to conceal. And it may only be frictionless <i>for now</i> - looking at the way transaction fees develop in the future is one of the most exciting concepts about it, to me.)<p>> Inflation is bad, but deflation is worse. [...] People hoard their cash, and spend it only begrudgingly, on absolute necessities.<p>I see how that is very different from the way capitalism works at the moment. But, conceptually, would it really be that bad?<p>I think an economy that builds on people buying loads of crap they don't need is at least comparatively bad. We certainly seem to have a problem with using more than we need from the planet.<p>> And they certainly dont spend it on hiring people  no matter how productive their employees might be, theyd still be better off just holding on to that money and not paying anybody anything.<p>Again, wouldn't the result just be that you only hire people who create more value than deflation? And wouldn't ""nobody paying anybody anything"" eventually cause inflation?<p>Finally, a lot of the arguments employed seem rather shoddy.<p>This is the argument against being your own bank:<p>> In Hollywood, if you show someone counting out huge sums of cash, thats an easy way for the director to say that hes a criminal.<p>This is the argument trying to discredit bitcoins principle of mistrust:<p>> Bitcoin, in that sense, is anti democratic.

That it's artificial limit is a rather clear ""we will have to come up with something better by then"". Not as a ""we will never need more bitcoins than this many"".<p>I may be wrong here, but didn't Satoshi set up bitcoin precisely to be a testing ground? Beta Software?

Have you ever tried replacing the packaged Perl on a n RHEL box?  It's not fun.  Also, since it's relied on by so much within the distro, the chances they are going to go through the trouble of updating the version and risk problems is very small.  On enterprise distros, you are essentially stuck with an out of date Perl before the distro ships, and stuck with it for the long support lifetime.<p>This is frustrating to the perl community, as anything that requires ""new"" features faces limited adoption as a significant portion of the community can't run those versions.<p>That's not to say that packaging perl isn't the way to go. I believe in many cases it is. I also think it depends on your  targets.  Three webservers does not make the same argument as a farm of boxes.

I am a university student, and the freedom and independence that comes with being a student is invaluable. I transitioned from the narrowly rule-bound high school to the liberated, independent university life. I feel it is <i>my</i> responsibility and mine alone for my attendance. I would feel like I was back at school if my attendance was monitored. So many universities are places that engender freedom of thought, movement and expression. It seems as if this ""were <i>you</i> there?"" Big Brother system stands in opposition to the liberty offered by universities. The system that can offer you freedom unlike in any other institution instead clamps down on you, Theory X style [2]. If I were to attend a university using this system, I would feel <i>less free</i> than I do now. I don't think that removing someone's freedom to guarantee attendance is a worthwhile payoff for the education they'd be receiving<p>[1] www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_Theory_Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_Theory_Y</a>",1365001662

There are already plenty of sick patients left over, not everybody gets world class healthcare at affordable costs. If you had more of them healthcare costs would go down and so the capital saved could go to other endeavours. Secondly, you heal people who contribute more to the pie. Finally, healthiness IS the pie, it is itself a type of wealth, arguably one of the most important.<p>And yes, skilled immigrants create wealth. But the same reasonable arguments that can be made for bringing in skilled tech immigigrants (NOT on indebtured servant visas) could be made for bringing in skilled healthcare immigrants.

The others were all more relevant - most of them were more topical with the ""'08"" or ""change"" in them, but the final logo just works so well.<p>Obama's logo reminds me a little of Bank of America's.  They both evoke an image of the American flag as well as farming/middle America (BofA's logo looks like farm plots to me and the red/white stripes of Obama's logo make me think the same).  The blue semi-circle looks somewhat like the arc of a rainbow over the horizon evoking (for me) a hopefulness that something is better over the horizon and an idea of inclusiveness.<p>It's one of the best logos I've seen.

396065,comment,395970,395970,0,0,sachinag,,,"What they're doing is most probably not illegal.  What they are doing is leveraging a lot of little things to make themselves good cash.<p>Let's be very clear - they use auctions.  This is not a lottery.  At the end of the day, the high bidder ""wins"" and pays the amount of the high bid to win the auction.  Then Swoopo adds the (.75 * number of bids placed) to that figure.  It's not inconceivable that that sum is less than MSRP.<p>At the end of the day, you can ensure that you win by placing the last (and highest) bid.  Because there's certainty of winning - it's not random - it's not a lottery, and as such, doesn't need to be state-sponsored (as is the case with lotteries in most jurisdictions).<p>What's fascinating about that is that very few retailers use auctions to sell goods that they own/control/are obligated to ship.  Auctions historically have only really been done by venues - eBay doesn't sell their own goods on the site; neither does eBid; and neither did Yahoo Auctions or Amazon Auctions (remember those?).<p>So Swoopo reinforces online marketplace psychology and eBay-style dynamics by having auctions.  This is even though Swoopo is the retailer and has to ship the good (whether Swoopo's dropshipping or not is irrelevant; they still make sure the high bidder gets the item or its nearest equivalent).<p>On Dawdle, we initially launched with a structure that eliminates the ""sniping"" problem that you have with eBay.  We had a structure where you could name your own price and any seller that had what you wanted could sell to you.  However, your offer was blind to the seller and the seller's minimum price was blind to the buyer.  It was very similar to the Priceline model, except that on Dawdle, the selling price was limited to the amount of the next highest offer + a bid increment.  So when the listing ended, the price that the item sold for was the 2nd highest amount + bid increment.  (On Priceline, whatever the offer is is the selling price; we wanted to give the impression to the buyer that they were getting a deal as they were paying less than what they had offered.)<p>I bring this up only to show the difference between having a different kind of auction structure (like Dawdle did, and we retain in a limited fashion with our StandingOffer technology) and what Swoopo is doing.  All Swoopo is doing is charging people to bid, setting the bid increment, and being a retailer disgused as a venue.<p>The question is, can this last?  Given the limited amount of differences between Swoopo and eBay, my guess is probably.  They'll have a branding issue if people keep attacking them, but at the end of the day, it's transparent.",1229115357

395997,comment,395833,395927,0,0,yters,,,"As for the term ""meaningless,"" I think I can see what the researchers are saying.  For example, when I first started programming in QBasic, I was trying to modify a game called Gorillas that came with the language.  In the game, there are two gorillas that try to destroy each other by throwing exploding bananas.  I saw one variable in the code was called 'banana' and thought changing it to 'baby' would make the gorillas throw babies at each other (yes, I was a strange kid).  Anyways, that would be an instance of looking for meaning where there isn't any.  I ignored the syntactical context of the variable in favor of the semantics of the variable name, though this was more due to me not being familiar with code.<p>So, the tested students who focus on the syntactical context of variables and keywords will probably be better at understanding programs than those who focus on their understanding of these words' semantics.  The problem is not ""meaning"" itself, but that they are using the wrong frame of reference to derive meaning.<p>Perhaps a better distinction, then, is objective vs subjective meaning.  Those who look for the objective frame of reference to infer meaning will understand programs better.  Once they do so, they can analyze programs more semantically.  For instance, now that I've been exposed to many languages, I know something called ""print,"" occurring in a certain position on a line, probably outputs textual information somewhere, such as stdout.",1229112946

Exacerbating this, demand for cars - even for Japanese cars - has plummeted as consumers are scared and are pulling back on all purchases, to say nothing of having difficulty securing auto loans. This in turn makes it even harder for the Big 3 to secure already difficult to receive credit.<p>The proximate cause of this potential bankruptcy is the credit crisis. If the Big 3 disappear because of the credit crisis, and suppliers go bankrupt as well, experts estimate that could mean the loss of 3 million jobs. Suppose you worked for a fairly well run auto supplier, and suddenly you don't have a job. Instead of considering buying a car - or any major good or service - you wouldn't be able to. If you worked in an industry either directly or tangentially related to autos - say auto dealers, gas stations, hotels, steel - you'd likely start to fear losing your job. Just the fear of losing your job would change your consumption habits. Fear becomes a self fulfilling prophesy, creating even lower demand, necessitating even more job cuts, lower prices, and even less demand. A Big 3 bankruptcy would lower aggregate demand, and have potentially massive consequences through the rest of the economy. An event can both be the result of supply/demand, and create new supply/demand - financial markets and the economy are a chaotic system. That's why it's so hard to predict exactly what the consequences of a Big 3 failure would be.",1229112928

The latter is especially important when I think I've already tried all possibilities.  It's a constant check that keeps me from thinking it's a problem on the computer's end, instead of a problem on my end.  I can think of a number of times when I've been able to solve the bug precisely because I kept the right mindset.",1229112627

17157,comment,16603,16603,0,0,cwilbur,,,"There's a <i>lot</i> more to being a web design expert than learning to code in HTML and CSS.  <p>So sayeth Jeffrey Zeldman:<p>Information architecture. Usability. Accessibility. Web standards. If you don't know about these things, stop designing websites until you have learned. Competence in graphic design is merely a baseline; it does not qualify you to create user experiences for the web.<p>Every time I think I can stop talking about these obvious, simple truths, some crazy bad 90s style train wreck hits me headlong and makes me weep anew.<p>(<a href=""http://www.zeldman.com/2007/04/18/cant-link-with-em/)"">http://www.zeldman.com/2007/04/18/cant-link-with-em/)</a>",1177617245

Things come apart and rattle around inside, the monitor connection starts to get fatigued and the screen develops snow, and it's heavier and thicker for less functionality than other laptops. <p>Much better to get a Dell preinstalled with Linux if they start doing that, or look at Emperor Linux: <a href=""http://www.emperorlinux.com"">http://www.emperorlinux.com</a><p>Much better experiences with them. I even got one for my girlfriend, who doesn't know anything at all about computers; they put Ubuntu on it and she adores it. <p>I'm currently on a Dell M70, which works fine; if I were to buy a new one, it'd be from Emperor.

It's a Java Application with an ""interesting"" UI (seems a bit ironic).  It's probably worth a few minutes of downloading and checking out to see if it suits your style.<p>Personally (and I'm more of developer than a designer), I'm with wammin, pencil paper or many white board sessions are where I start for the first few dozen iterations.  The last thing I want is yet another tool to get in my way, providing more complexity than value.  Once things settle down, or if you have to work with off-site people, electronic versions make a lot of sense.  ",1177616782
17148,comment,16803,16844,0,0,Goladus,,,"Being kind to your employees should really just be obvious.  Unfortunately it is not.  Many people with rank in a company treat others terribly, simply because they can.  Probably they don't know any better, and haven't considered the downsides.  Joel does a really good job of packaging ideas from books like Peopleware and Mythical Man-Month in a way average people will respond to.  No matter what his software company does, that's valuable service.<p>I don't know all that much about bug tracking software, but at my last company the trouble ticketing system they used was a monstrosity (Peregrine Service Center).  Everyone hated it.  It had a sluggish java applet client.  It was an enormous resource hog, it was buggy, and had a horrid interface.  It took forever to log in and logged you out after 15 minutes of inactivity (taking over your desktop to inform you of that fact).  I'd guess this load of crap was costing the company a fortune compared to a shrink-wrap solution like FogBugz.  <p>Here's a picture of the interface: <a href=""http://www.goladus.com/_.jpg"">http://www.goladus.com/_.jpg</a>

It is one of the places which usually lacks because many VMs assume a calling convention, like the one in Java, say. The JVM is a bit better here as it uses a stack-based engine, and as such is somewhat simpler to handle.<p>Functional compilers rarely, if ever, uses the standard conventions for handling this. Especially if they want to avoid boxing polymorphic parameters, and expand them for speed.<p>We could have had far better client-side and academic penetration of the JVM by now, had Sun played their cards differently.

Sadly it seemed to work at first, but now it is basically a tool for Gnome/Fedora to bludgeon the rest into submission by sheer weight of code.<p>Frankly it seems that Linux has grown its own &quot;internal&quot; MS. A massive, overfed gorilla in the form of Red Hat. And it is now swinging its weight around, thinking it has &quot;won&quot; some kind of unix war. Sadly it may well be right, as there is few that can match it in the amount of man hours it can throw at a project.<p>Damn it, <a href=""https://github.com/subuser-security/subuser/issues/216"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/subuser-security/subuser/issues/216</a> is a &quot;blog&quot; entry related to Docker that holds a mention of such weight throwing.<p>&quot;A number of developers from RedHat were once very involved in the project. However, these developers had a very arrogant attitude towards Docker: They wanted docker changed so that it would follow their design ideas for RHEL and systemd. They often made pull requests with poorly written and undocumented code and then they became very agressive when those pull requests were not accepted, saying &quot;we need this change we will ship a patched version of Docker and cause you problems on RHEL if you don&#x27;t make this change in master.&quot; They were arogant and agressive, when at the same time, they had the choice of working with the Docker developers and writting quality code that could actually be merged. Another thing they often said was along the lines of &quot;systemd is THE ONE AND ONLY INIT SYSTEM so why do you care about writing code that might be portable?&quot; Or &quot;even though the universal method works with systemd now. A redesign has already been planned in systemd, so do it the new systemd way and don&#x27;t be portable.&quot;(This is in response to the fact that Docker writes to cgroups, and systemd would like to be the &quot;sole writter to cgroups&quot; some time in the future.)&quot;",1440931828

10142962,comment,10142186,10142186,0,0,yason,,,"To me it is obvious that the way to go would be to abstract out the power source by using an electric drivetrain regardless of the engine. When the car has electric motors connected directly to drive shafts you can eliminate lots of the mechanical linkage and you are also free to redesign and relocate the power source as you wish.<p>But, most importantly, once you accept the slight inefficiencies in converting energy to electricity and then to radial forces, you are free to experiment with whatever power source you like:<p>- use batteries like Tesla: you can simply fill with batteries any compartments of the body that you wish. The car runs as long as the batteries have charge.<p>- use fuel cells if those ever become viable.<p>- design a small, self-contained turbocharged diesel engine that runs at the optimum RPM to drive a generator when the batteries need charging: put it in the boot or the front bay, but you don&#x27;t need to consider how it connects with the wheels mechanically, and it can be lighter and doesn&#x27;t have to support a wide range of RPMs like current engines.<p>- or maybe linear generator engines powered by gasoline or diesel (like what Toyota has been developing) turn out to be optimal for mobile electricity generation for some period in the future.<p>- or maybe a low-cost turbine engine hooked to a generator like the Whisper concept car: the engine can burn nearly anything and provides high power output at high RPM that would otherwise be in the impractical range for a car.<p>But if you combine any power source <i>and</i> a small battery, that allows you to buffer energy and only use the combustion engine to occasionally recharge the battery. You can drive the rush hour traffic or a downtown route using mostly electric power only, and rely on the combustion engine to recharge the battery when parked (but not plugged in to mains) or while driving during longer trips. A reasonable compromise for range anxiety would be to drop down to limited power when the battery runs out and you need to rely on the combustion engine only. You could still reach your destination but at slower speeds.<p>Nevertheless, the options are quite unlimited. Buffering of energy is more useful than raw power in the future just like an Android phone is more useful than a desktop PC in the general case even if it&#x27;s slower and runs only a day or so without charging. Only serious usage warrants desktop PCs with stationary power supplies: most online activities can be done with a low-power device that runs on energy buffered in the battery.",1440931750

10142940,comment,10142186,10142368,0,0,ThePhysicist,,,"I think BMW has been working on technologies for electric cars for a very long time already, probably even longer than all-electric car manufacturers like Tesla have existed. In Munich you already see quite a lot of electric BMWs and charging stations, so the technology seems to be pretty mature as far as I can tell.<p>I think the main reason they did not make the transition to (partially) electric cars earlier is that they did not want to cannibalize their business with non-electric cars. Another point is the still-missing charging infrastructure and the (to my limited knowledge) lack of some universal standard for charging stations. The final point is that today potential buyers of electric cars still have many good alternatives that are as much or even more ecological than all-electric cars. If you look e.g. at the new models from Volkswagen or BMW, many of the smaller ones use 4 liters of gasoline / 100 km or less (i.e. > 71 MPG), which is pretty hard to beat in terms of eco-friendliness and efficiency considering that electricity is still much more expensive than gasoline in terms of energy / price.<p>One driving factor in the transition to partially electric cars might be that there are not many other possibilities left to further increase the efficiency of conventional engines. In fact, most of the increase in efficiency that we have seen in the last decade was not due to better thermodynamic design of the motor block but better control of e.g. the fuel injection through more advanced sensors and electronics. As this optimization path seems to have reached is maximum potential it probably makes a lot of sense to use electric motors to e.g. recover braking energy, which should shave off another few percent in fuel consumption (Toyota already proved the feasibility of this very successfully with their Prius series).",1440930838

Just think of American sign language, which has 26 letters only one of which includes motion (the Z).[1]  And that&#x27;s on a single hand, so just counting the letters in ASL only - and no other gestures, you can count to at least 676.  Add a few more static hand shapes - there are lots of shapes in ASL- maybe try to learn a hundred per hand, which is good because you can encode two digits in each hand, I could confidently count to 10,000 using just my fingers.  It would probably take no more than a few days to learn.&quot;<p>Would I pass your interview?  Probably not, because it wasn&#x27;t what you were thinking of.

The Swiss cycle infrastructure is clearly driven by compromise in terms of money and space, but it always respects the cyclist and is very good at avoiding safety pitfalls like dedicated cycle infrastructure at roundabouts.<p>In Germany, otoh, cycle infrastructure is everywhere (even in placed where law doesn&#x27;t actually allow it) but suffers a lot from a tradition of building cycle infrastructure for the benefit of cars, dating back to you-know-whom. Instead of picking the type of infrastructure by how well it matches the specific needs of the place where it is built, this decision is mostly driven by one size fits all best practice ideas that change like fashion. The result is a dangerous, inconsistent mess that makes some cyclists envy American &quot;cyclists share the road&quot; signs.<p>Unfortunately, Swiss cities don&#x27;t have the modal split numbers required to be internationally recognized as a template to copy (even Basel!

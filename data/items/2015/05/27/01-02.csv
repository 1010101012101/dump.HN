Saying things like that make you look really bad - no one will take you seriously.<p>I got that 16 ns with cache-line aligned carefully tuned assembler. No false sharing. And it most definitely didn&#x27;t use CAS, but FAA. I used CPU TSC timers.<p>That said, I&#x27;m pretty sure you can achieve close to that in Java as well. 20-40 ns latency between two CPU cores on same socket wouldn&#x27;t surprise me at all. Throughput can be even higher, if you start to batch messages.<p>Anyways:<p>1) Cost of CAS depends on contention. About 15 ns in any case without contention.<p>2) Timing accuracy on Java... Well not that I really use Java much, but I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s exactly same as on C++, if you can access TSC somehow. Nothing prevents from ping-ponging messages between two threads either a few million times -- that way even low resolution timer is more than enough. Yes, 20ish ns latency is doable.<p>3) Who cares about memory latency, the point is to communicate by cache line sharing. Main memory would defeat that.<p>4) ?",1432691610

Bringing some modern server-grade sandboxing techniques (containers, VMs, chroots, etc.) to the desktop and mobile realms in an easy-to-use manner would alleviate the need for browsers to try and implement this themselves.",1432691369

I think this is where some of us might be talking at cross-purposes. Given that implementing robust architecture typically requires work, even if the expectation is that it will be efficient in the long term, I don&#x27;t see how one can reasonably argue for a flexible architecture to support future developments without considering what sorts of development are most likely to be necessary. Whether you choose to assume general programming principles or something more domain specific is just a matter of degree -- even a simple modular design is more work than spaghetti code in a trivial case, but I imagine most of us would agree that trying to keep things modular is highly likely to pay off for any project of non-trivial scale.",1432691175

What I would dispute is the implication, typical of many pro-YAGNI posters in this thread and elsewhere, that the alternative to YAGNI is somehow diving in and developing everything up-front without reference to the relative risks of requirements changing vs. incurring additional costs by delaying. That is a false dichotomy.<p><i>For instance, I can&#x27;t recall an application I&#x27;ve developed wherein it wasn&#x27;t clear where to separate responsibilities (i.e. impose boundaries) for the current problem. These separations are generally applicable to future iterations.</i><p>I suspect this is where our experience differs. To me, one reasonable guideline for modular design and separation of concerns is that each module should roughly correspond to a unit of change, in the sense that a change in requirements would ideally affect a single module without interfering elsewhere in the system. However, if your basic premise is that you can&#x27;t tell anything in advance about what your future requirements might be, you might model the current known situation in all kinds of different ways, but some will be much more future-proof than others.<p>Consider the old chestnut of modelling bank accounts. If you only have to model a balance on a single account, you can have some data structure that stores the balance and some functions to increase or decrease it. As soon as you need to model transfers <i>between</i> accounts, it turns out that the above is a very unhelpful data model, and your emphasis on single accounts was a poor choice. Even the most basic assumptions about likely future applications would have led to a more useful path, but if you follow YAGNI you have to start with a single-account model and then follow an onerous migration procedure precisely when you need to work with multiple accounts for the first time.",1432690629

To say that F/OSS doesn&#x27;t refer to 2 different features, &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open source&quot;, is to advance only one of the viewpoints from the 2 movements.<p>As much as it would be convenient if it were not the case, &quot;free software&quot; and &quot;open source&quot; software do, in fact, refer to different (although similar) things in many people&#x27;s minds.<p>I am not the right person to explain the differences and if gnu.org were not down I would simply point you to the arguments that the FSF have against referring to free software as &quot;open source&quot;.  However, I will do my best to explain.  Please verify what I&#x27;m about to say when you get the opportunity.<p>The intent of free software is to ensure that all users and programmers can deal with the software on a level playing field.  By this I mean that one programmer can not use legal or technical mechanisms to have more capability than another.  Everybody has the same access and ability to run the software for whatever purpose they want.  They can inspect the source code in an un-obfuscated way.  They can modify it in any way.  They can distribute it, along with their modifications, to others.  Most importantly, they can not do anything that will take away these abilities (either through legal or technical means) from others.<p>The licenses in the free software movement are a means to that end.  The free software movement defines licenses that are free (in other words licenses which do not impose restrictions that would remove the level playing field).  Some licenses, though, are free in and of themselves, but do not actually stop people from working in a non-freedom-oriented way (I&#x27;m sure I am not the only person frustrated that there is no antonym for &quot;free software&quot; -- all commonly used ones being deprecated by the FSF).<p>For example, there are many licenses which are free licenses but which allow people to leverage the code in software that is not free.  This creates an un-level playing field because those people can build on top of the software, extending it in a way that only they can use and then compete against the original project without being free.  In other words, if project A is free software licensed with a permissive license, someone can make A+ which is essentially A but with more features.  They can release this under a non-free license, competing against A and taking mind share without giving people the freedom to modify or distribute A+.<p>For this reason, people in the free software movement prefer some free licenses over others.  Their entire reason for having the licenses in the first place is to avoid the situation described above.<p>The open source movement is not as concerned about the issue described above.  While they advocate nearly identical methods, their goal is to encourage licenses that allow people to interoperate smoothly if they choose to do so.<p>In the open source movement, it is unreasonable to prefer licences that enforce software freedom over other OSI software licenses.  In fact, many people in the open source movement consider these kinds of licenses to be undesirable because it stops them from using F/OSS to build products that are not free software -- in other words, they are diametrically opposed to software freedom and only cooperate in a similar fashion when it is advantageous for them.<p>In my opinion, the term &quot;Free and Open Source Software&quot; is useful for discussing the very large amount of area where the free software movement and the open source movement overlap.  It is important not to conflate the two movements, though, because whether or not you value software freedom there are many people who do.<p>In my own usage, I prefer to use the term free software when I think that the freedom aspect of it is important.  I use F/OSS when I am just talking about interoperating with people using free software/OSI licenses.  I use OSS when I am talking about leveraging F/OSS into software that is not free.",1432690429

It mediates your senses, your reality is &quot;augmented&quot; in a number of ways, you have information being fed to you from various subsystems. You&#x27;re empowered, but you&#x27;re also somewhat isolated by the cockpit, too, and it&#x27;s easy to start to think about reality in terms of what the various feeds and subsystems are telling you and think about your actions largely in terms of the controls in front of you. Perhaps at first you focus that way because it&#x27;s all so new and awesome and exciting, then later because you just got used to it while barely noticing how totally you accepted this interface to the world. Over time the system itself shapes your perceptions and thinking, and you think less like what you were before you climbed in and more like the system itself.<p>That&#x27;s a colorful metaphor for saying that once you&#x27;re in the leadership of an organization, you see like the organization does, because you &quot;see&quot; via the organization, but I think it adds something.<p>(BTW -- it&#x27;s also true of everyone to some extent. It&#x27;s a useful exercise to think about exactly what kind of mecha you&#x27;ve climbed into and how it&#x27;s influencing you.)<p>I think this tendency may be more pronounced in organizations with strong mission-oriented and ends-justify-means cultures.. like, say military/defense/national security orgs, which we intentionally staff with people we train to set the value of human autonomy and even life (theirs and others) below various goals and &quot;interests.&quot;",1432689642

Errors in pricing can occur, and when there is an arbitrage opportunity and a market maker loses money then it is assumed (possibly) due to a pricing error which the arbitrager shouldn&#x27;t have taken advantage of.<p>A bit of history how the messaging protocol works might make things clearer.<p>In the old days a trade would take place over the phone as follows:<p>You: &quot;I&#x27;d like to buy USDJPY, $1 million worth please&quot;\nMarket Maker or broker (MM): &quot;Ok you can get $1 million dollars worth for 123&quot;<p>At this point there was a gentleman&#x27;s agreement you would respond within 4 seconds whether you want that price or not (as the market may move)<p>You: &quot;Mine, I&#x27;ll take it&quot;<p>Here you have completed your side of the contract and cannot back out. You just need the MM to confirm that they can still get your USDJPY 1 million 123 (this was traditionally confirmed with a trader sitting nearby who could see all the prices and volumes being published in the market and could give a price at which they could hedge the entire volume and still make a profit. These days traders still perform this role to a small extent but generally the broker would read a price off a screen themselves).<p>If they can, MM: &quot;It&#x27;s yours, USDJPY 1 million at 123&quot; and the transaction (contract) is confirmed good. The position is transferred to you, and the trader who provided the original price hedges the risk and gets out of the position, flattening his trading book.<p>If the market has since moved and the trade is no longer profitable, MM: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry the price has changed, you can now buy at 123.1&quot; and you jump back up to the previous<p>Ok, so all this has been upgraded with technology over the years, specifically messaging is now done via the FIX protocol (same as is used for other asset classes). But the basic flow is still the same:<p>You: Request price at a quantity\nMM: provides price\nYou: decide whether to take that price\nMM: confirms that the price is still good, then sends you confirmation the trade was good (and hedges the trade), or otherwise rejects the trade.<p>The issue arbitraging causes is that if the prices in the market move and those moves are known to the arbitrageur but not to the market maker then the market maker gets into a position where they accept and confirm the trade, but can&#x27;t hedge out at the price they thought they could, and so lose money on the trade. A few of these trades and the losses start to build up, and if it keeps happening with a certain client (remember, no anonymous exchanges here) then it&#x27;s easy to punish that client (show them worse prices, cut them off completely, etc). If an arbitrageur is hiding behind a third party then the market maker might have enough clout to punish the entire third party (in which case it would be in the third party&#x27;s interest to seek out the arbitrageur and punish them themselves).",1432689574

Swift is a disaster, the app store approval process feels like going back 10 years in a time machine, debugging XCode is like trying to solve the riddle of the Sphinx, testing is hard, a reloaded dev workflow is non-existent... It&#x27;s no wonder startups can&#x27;t get out the door and quickly iterate on mobile.<p>It&#x27;s crystal clear that using web tooling and compiling Javascript to native components is the way forward here. It&#x27;s just that tools like PhoneGap, Titanium, Cordova ... were half-baked solutions and never really excited me. This is why React Native is such a game-changing technology. If a startup can get to iOS and quickly iterate without being held back by XCode/Swift it&#x27;s a massive competitive advantage. Let other companies spend millions and 9 months hiring &#x27;iOS only&#x27; developers, and struggling to get a V1 to market when you can take just your existing model layer which is already rendering JavaScript somewhere anyway, and have it target iOS native without missing a beat.<p>Really interested to see the fallout from React Native, especially once the Android library is released later this year.",1432689268

It&#x27;s pretty great for those looking for a way to read/consume links you fnd on social media faster. It&#x27;s much quicker than loading up your browser everytime. It also laods links in a stripped quick read mode to display only the relevant content. This saves you load time and data. It has a few quirks, like some lagging, and a few features you&#x27;d miss from a real browser, but nothing too big that can&#x27;t be added or fixed later on, in my opinion of course.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, check out the full review at http://claytonwrites.com/flynx-a-smarter-way-to-read-the-web/<p>Has anyone tried Flynx, or any other browser like this? If you have experience with it, let&#x27;s discuss. It&#x27;d be pretty cool to see the other side of the spectrum. Let me know what you think about it.",1432688628

In the process, you may (or may not) find the truth, and you may (or may not) be closer to it. What did you actually mean by ""hope of a search for truth""?<p>Now, trying to ""find some agreeable progress in mutual understanding"" sounds like a damn good substitute to ""searching for truth"". Mutual understanding is the best approximation of truth I know of, when truth actually has something to do with the conversation.<p>Now that I think of it, mutual understanding may not be such a good substitute, but merely a prerequisite. Meaning, until the different parties understand where they agree, and where they disagree (and maybe even <i>why</i> they do), search for the truth is hopeless.",1277722454

Also, having the speakers being some kind of rockstars (Peldi is been 'on tour' all summer so far, does he ever work on Balsamiq?) might create a huge gap between you and them, and this dosen't help creating solid connections in most of the cases.\nI'm not sure if the 'you've got to spend money to make money' motto applies here, but again, I may be wrong.

You could have also transferred your funds into Paypal.  I didn't get from the conversation that he would have been a guy to screw you over with non-payment, but you could have been screwed over by changing scopes and unrealistic expectations.

Distraction is not necessarily a bad thing when we are reading.<p>One of the reasons that we are told to read a lot is to increase our vocabulary. But how is that supposed to happen? We're supposed to come across a word that we don't know in a book, and then look it up in the dictionary. Isn't this the ultimate form of distraction? Unless you read next to a dictionary, you have to put your book/newspaper/magazine down, go find your dictionary, look up the word, and reapply that new knowledge to the content again.<p>Not only that, when we read content, aren't we supposed to be inspired by it (at least sometimes)? I was inspired by this small revelation to drop reading the essay/blog post and come back to HN to post this comment. The article triggered a small epiphany in me that inspired me to create/share information. Isn't this a good thing?",1277721431

It's absolutely true that role models help extremely.<p>When my cofounder and I were in the really early stages we often were looking for inspiration and while we knew very well that lots of US and many UK bootstrapped SaaS products exist and thrive, we feared their success wouldn't easily translate to us.<p>We were thinking ""Oh maybe people from the US and UK won't buy from continental europeans, who aren't native speakers, wo live in a different time zone, where (in the US case) totally different laws apply"" and while in no way this was going to make us stop, it was constantly nagging in the background of - at least - my mind.<p>It has turned out this is not the case. As of today there was exactly one case where a company from the US told us they'd love to use our product, yet feared to export their sensitive data to the EU.<p>But before we knew that from hard evidence we had inspiration: letsfreckle.com (Vienna), mite.yo.lk (Berlin) and mindmeister.com (Vienna and Munich) exist and thrive just as well as US based SaaS providers.<p>And this is IMHO what Amy Hoy is talking about in her blog post: These were our role models and while I don't think we would have stopped creating letsannotate.com if we wouldn't know about their success stories, it certainly helped to know we weren't the first to step into this unexplored terrain of bootstrapping in continental Europe.",1277720036

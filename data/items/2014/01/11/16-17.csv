Programming is <i>hard</i> to get right, no matter what the language. I hate these people who come along saying &quot;hurr, durr, C sucks, project X should have been written in language Y!&quot; All the while ignoring the facts that a) they can go and rewrite X in Y any time they like, and b) if it was written in Y, people would be bitching about issues with Y (eg, speed). Shortsightedness and lack of will to put your code where your mouth is are two of the most despicable traits a programmer can have.",1389459582

I would like to compare a twitter account a lot more to a e-mail address. Celeberties and brands ( lets not forgot about brands ) have worked very hard (or waited rather long, at least) to get their millions of followers and their @username signature.<p>I think this is what causes a kind of lock-in: moving away would mean that your messages would get a lot less attention and having to wait a long time to be back at a million followers AND abandoning your @username, which many people have come to know you by.<p>Now I don&#x27;t know anybody by their Facebook profile URL, while I know many celebrity @usernames, even though I don&#x27;t use Twitter. Finding somebody on Facebook is the same as finding anybody on any profile site. You have to use the search, there is no added value. Twitter has a very strong weapon here with their @username offering.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think a new platform could offer enough extra&#x27;s for them to take the step. Another platform would have to offer something so special that it justifies leaving a million followers behind. I don&#x27;t see this happening because the strength of Twitter is its LACK of features. You type something and move on. You see how that cancels out any newcomer?<p>I&#x27;m from Europe, and I see a lot of people using Twitter. If I look at my Facebook stream, a lot of the status-updates are coming in through Twitter, or at least apps that post to multiple networks.<p>Also, I think that I should add that both you and me are commenting from own experience, neither of us is saying anything based on market research.

Samsung&#x27;s apps are extremely poor quality. I own 3 of their devices (two phones and a tablet) and I don&#x27;t use a single Samsung app on any of them. I would actually pay extra for a Samsung device with stock Android installation modified for Samsung hardware support and <i>nothing</i> else.<p>Not to say I don&#x27;t have problems with Google, I do. Privacy, in particular the lack of granular control to lock down feature access by application, the scenario is this:<p>You&#x27;re looking for a app particular type of app, you find a simple one that does everything you need, requiring only access to store data locally. Perfect! You install it, then a month later an update comes out that requires additional privileges, network access, because the developer has decided that everybody must want to store their notes in the cloud. Obviously you can elect to remain at the previous version for something as simple as the notepad, but when you move to more complex apps that&#x27;s no longer an option. If you stopped updating apps a year ago for instance, you&#x27;d now be vulnerable to a myriad of attacks due to improper SSL implementations that&#x27;ve since been corrected.<p>I&#x27;m aware that in that context I could install a firewall and remove the apps network access, but how could you prevent an app accessing your contacts, messages, SD card, etc.<p>Surely there&#x27;s a market for guaranteed apps that guarantee zero feature-creep?

The average home is under 2000 sq ft and pretty nice for the time (lots of split levels). 3 or 4 bedroom etc. Lots are .25 to .5 acre. But being older homes you can&#x27;t, for example, fit a king bed in any of those homes. Or modern bathrooms, where 2 people can get ready in the morning at the same time don&#x27;t exist there. You might be able to cram a grand piano into one of the larger basements, with nothing else, or replace the family room with it in a tight squeeze.<p>The crime rate is up in this area, and last year a woman was found chopped up and stuffed into a set of suitcases that were dumped behind some dumpsters at the nearest McDonalds. Schools are old and run down, they just shut down the last remaining library, there&#x27;s 1 public pool and though shopping is plentiful, it&#x27;s all a 15-20 minute drive away.<p>The next area over was built in the early 2000s during the boom and the <i>town houses</i> start at 2400 sq ft. It&#x27;s almost insane. A smaller single family with a finished basement starts at around 3200 sq ft and the average size is pushing up on 4000 sq ft. Lots are about .25 acre.<p>The difference in price between the two locations is $0 for the town houses and about $100-150 for the smaller single-family.<p>I&#x27;d also add that the schools in the newer area are all new and very nice, shopping is better, there&#x27;s convenient walking to local town centers, public transport to the metro system and the nearest cities. The neighborhoods are all fiber internet have in-neighborhood police/fire &quot;public safety centers&quot;, several neighborhood pools and plentiful community activities -- among other amenities.<p>So all things being equal, you may not be happier with the larger home, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt, and the neighborhood is a lot nicer.",1389458566

I terminated the interview, and sent a complaint about this kid to the Amazon recruiter who set up the interview (never heard back, obviously).<p>I&#x27;m terrible at writing code in interviews or answering quiz type questions.

I enjoy talking to people, and usually in these sorts of open ended interviews, I do pretty well.<p>The OP seemed uncertain about going to this interview in the first place; he had a pretty good situation, he doesn&#x27;t really like the interview process and is not that comfortable with that type of social situation.  He didn&#x27;t like breaking his routine, either.  Therefore, it&#x27;s not too surprising if his lack of enthusiasm came across.<p>What&#x27;s inexcusable is for him to have invested all that time, and for them to have invested all that time, and not to give him the courtesy of a one liner email followup, especially after a verbal offer was made.  Annoying, but not at all uncommon.  It&#x27;s happened to me, too; I remember in particular an all day interview at GTE, a verbal offer, then nothing.  The only thing you can do is just shrug it off and move on.<p>(If it&#x27;s any consolation, I&#x27;ve cut back on Amazon orders since they started charging state sales tax where I live.

Burchfield, editor of The New Fowler’s Modern English Usage, has written that it’s only a matter of time before this practice becomes standard English: “The process now seems irreversible.” Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed.) already finds the singular they acceptable “even in literary and formal contexts,” but the Usage Panel of The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed.) isn’t there yet.<p>—nytimes.com, 2009",1389457031

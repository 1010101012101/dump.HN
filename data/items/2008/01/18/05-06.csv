100189,comment,100170,100170,0,0,mynameishere,,,"A few of the privations of the Chinese were listed: Heating, housing, vegetable oil, and a clean environment. I'm not sure if these things are related to trade imbalances so much as overpopulation.<p>So China is holding a lot of bad paper. I don't know why in god's name you would buy debt from the US when it's basically low-yield junk, and has been for a while. The old saying is: When you owe your banker a 1000 dollars, you're in trouble. When you owe him a million dollars, he's in trouble. So China's in trouble.<p>Their odd dollar-centric twist on mercantilism isn't likely to help them in the long term: Once the export markets (and jobs) dry up, the people will have all the iPods they want, but the heating/oil/living space/environment problems aren't likely to be solved.",1200635771

100186,comment,100175,100175,0,0,boucher,,,"This is a good refutation of the linked article.  The authors of the original article definitely seem to misunderstand both the purpose and the usefulness of MapReduce.<p>The claim that MapReduce is a poor implementation, for example, is particularly silly.  Most large scale relational databases rely on very powerful centralized machines, and replicas of those machines.  MapReduce, by contrast, relies on a large number of commodity systems.  The decentralized nature makes hardware failure much less likely to cause problems.  The system knows how to dynamically reallocate tasks, and new nodes can also be added while the system is running.",1200635270

Just ask NBC or USA Today. Then ask them about their plans now that their audiences are declining.<p>The great thing about the massive-eyeballs model is that it's very easy to measure, very easy to pick and choose between advertisers, etc.<p>The bad thing is that it reminds me of that saying ""if X is so easy, why isn't everyone doing it?"" Well, everyone <i>is</i>. So they need lock-in mechanisms like subscriptions.<p>In short, it's fragile & cut-throat but it has a great potential for buckets of easy cash.",1200633676

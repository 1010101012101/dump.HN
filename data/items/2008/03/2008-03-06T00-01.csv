In most company hierarchies QA ranks pretty much near the bottom, somewhere between development and support.<p>In my (limited) experience, those who are good at testing also tend to hate doing it, while those who enjoy it tend to be mediocre (the third category being those who both hate testing and are bad at it).  A good tester who enjoys testing seems to be a lot harder to find than a good programmer who enjoys programming, and chances are the pay is lower.",1204765188

130165,comment,129407,129756,0,0,tel,,,"Regular and mobile browsing is one major exception. It's also generally not the trend that I'm referring to. A good site probably does make up to three versions for screen, mobile, and print views. Some sites might even, serendipitously, make out by just changing the stylesheet.<p>Avoiding table based layouts is not the definition of accessibility and I never implied that. They are frequently a symptom of poor accessibility, however, and then they almost always obscure the intended hierarchy of a page which defeats accessibility for text based browsers and screen readers and messes with SEO.",1204765104

But then again in my experience when this is not mandatory there are always 1-2 ""I'll stay in and seem extra dedicated"" people.  Then other people start growing roots at their desks.  Then it all falls apart.<p>Plus think of this way: how many times do you resolve ideas passively in the shower, out on a walk, picking up dry cleaning/doing laundry, out shopping, etc.?<p>There's a reason that happens and just like exercise, if you don't schedule it, it's easy to let it slide when things get busy.",1204765067

2. If you don't make decisions based on data... Just how are you making decisions?<p>I am serious about question #2. We aren't talking about face to face interviews here, we're talking about looking at 200 resumes and deciding which ten people to call with the expectation of bringing 3-5 of the ten in for interviews.<p>In my experience, when people tell me they are using their ""experience"" and ""judgment,"" They are actually using a highly biased process, such as selecting people who went to their University or preferring people who share the same hobbies.",1204764998

130145,comment,129517,129517,0,0,arthole,,,"Do it.<p>Based on your question, you are looking at the visual arts.  So, what kind of art are you going to do?  do you want to sell work in galleries?  If so, do it.  but don't commit half way.  Be prolific.  Don't paint for 4 years and then give up.  Because, unless your paintings are Rembrandts (in which case why give up?) your paintings will be worthless in the long run to whomever bought them... or to their children.  Antiques roadshow price... $50.00, not $50000.00<p>So consider at least the people you will interact with, and the contribution you make back to the world.  Paintings accrue value because of the longevity and quality of the artist.  This is true for the other arts as well.  Compete against the world, but more importantly compete against your friends.  It raises your skills and qualities.  Follow your own vision, because that is the great difference between you and the other guys.<p>It's other artists that decide what is good art.  not galleries or collectors or anyone else.  so hang out with your peers.  only good things come of it.<p>Be serious and have fun.<p>In the great scheme of things, it really doesn't matter what you do, except to you.<p>Reading these comments, I am reminded by Yoda's sage wisdom.  ""Do or do not.  There is no 'Try'"".<p>For the record, you can do both.  It's just harder.  Because you should never use one interest as an excuse for poor performance in another.<p>So do it.  It is an entrepreneurial life.  Work your ass off and you can become a great success.  it is true in any field.  The real success comes from those who do the work.  And it's a startup world, just like Web 2.0.  You can be too far ahead of the curve, or yesterdays news, or provide products the market really likes or miss completely, or come in as a poor second.  The art world like silicon valley is very forgiving especially to people who keep on bringing new work for people to experience.<p>Not many people remember when the Blue Man group were crazy street performers in New York.  They worked hard and adapted  or tried different things and are now a big success.  It's just like a startup.  work hard; be adaptive; see what works; do your thing.    Sounds kind of familiar doesn't it?",1204763589
130144,comment,129689,129838,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Some data is not always better than no data. Sometimes data can provide a bias that you don't want. So it has to be the right data that you have. For example knowing that someone attended a prestigious university is likely to create a bias towards hiring that person and ignoring clues that indicate otherwise.<p>If your classification filter recommends somebody it's possible to let that piece of information provide the same kind of bias. So if the data you have is likely to be unreliable you might want to just ignore it.",1204763588

130130,comment,129517,129517,0,0,lee,,,"The most successful transition I ever saw from one to the other was a gentleman who started out as an electrical engineer and used the money he made very wisely to launch and systematically market his photography. It took about three years, but he was already a very good hobby photographer - in other words, his work was of professional quality. He got very familiar with the market - decided to go with gallery marketing. Then he was very careful about which galleries he went with. (They like to 'discover' someone, so if you've already been with a lesser gallery, it's a big strike against you. This absolutely kills a lot of artists who never find this out.) Then he spent several big grand creating his marketing materials, and carefully targeted his market - the right gallery owners. When he launched, he had figured out his prices - for a limited edition there would be graduated pricing - if you get in early, then you pay less.<p>He's also very sensitive to the larger market - he knows that people don't like to have stark pictures of despair in their living room. It's not his favorite picture to take, but that's his brand. This enables him to work maybe ten days out of the year. He lives in a penthouse apartment overlooking the Pacific. He's a darn good photographer, but there are many as good who never hit it big. The reason people hit it big in the arts (just like anything) is marketing and developing a well-crafted brand over time. He went for where the big money was - the galleries who deal with very upscale clients - and he never deviated from that brand. Being in tech means that you can save up enough to make the transition right and jump in at a higher market. Take the time to evaluate several different markets before you decide - figure out your best approach and then don't be stingy funding it. You can be very successful.",1204762379

The most prominent brand I interact with is a major grocery chain. This is because they have a huge store 5 minutes from my house. I&#x27;m not going to start going to another store even if it carpet-bombs my browser to get brand awareness. VC-funded adtech won&#x27;t help anyone scale brick and mortar.<p>My purchasing decisions are based mainly on whatever is the cheapest. I do find brands useful, to the extent that if a product is brand-name, it&#x27;s likely to be more expensive than the no-name variety one shelf below. Saves some mental effort of comparing prices more closely.<p>The muesli I purchase is store-brand.

10574730,comment,10573325,10574053,0,0,sageikosa,,,"Also Dawkins posits a relatively good empirical definition of species boundaries (although I&#x27;m not quoting him verbatim, and I may be extending/synthesizing some of the ideas somewhat), but...a species is basically the pool of organisms available at a period of time that can generate progeny that themselves can generate progeny.  That is, they have replicator compatibility...<p>Under that definition, humans make a species.  Horses make a species, donkeys make a species, but mules do not.  Apparently in the world of Star Trek, Klingons and humans make a species: Worf (Klingon) had a child with a half-human/half-Klingon woman, and Tom Paris (human) had a child with a half-human/half-Klingon woman.  Not sure about Vulcans and Romulans...obviously they can mate, but I&#x27;m not sure Spock himself can have children, perhaps we&#x27;ll find out in a future movie.  In Futurama, Kiff reproduced with Leela.<p>As to the concept of a human as a &quot;super-organism&quot;, the problem with bacteria being part of the equation is that they do not transmit their replicator payload through the germ-line transmission vector.  They are not integrated into the next generation in whole or in part.  Via the concept of the extended phenotype they may alter and extend their environment to improve their chance of success (and often mothers and children have the same bacteria flora), but it&#x27;s better to think of it as symbiosis (or in the worst case, parasitism) than true &quot;super-organism&quot; reproduction.

I definitely agree with most of the author&#x27;s points, especially the Argentine skittishness around seasonings and spices. The beef is fantastic without any embellishment, though. Two things that I&#x27;m surprised at is the author&#x27;s lack of mention of the Argentine obsessions with mayo, and the separate but equally baffling obsession with ham and cheese (as a combo). I saw mayo abused very frequently when I was in Argie. I also saw ham and cheese plastered onto every menu.<p>&quot;Items are preventatively glazed with sugar whenever there is be the slightest doubt as to whether they are supposed to be sweet or savory; this is what prevents the otherwise excellent Argentine croissants (medialunas) from being the king of breakfasts.&quot;<p>Ah yes, the heavenly medialuna. I don&#x27;t consider them to be ultra-sugary, but they do have a lot more sugar than a typical croissant. I know my girlfriend (who is Argentine) is crazy for medialunas, and I quite enjoy them also. They&#x27;re much more flavorful and properly sized (small) than other croissants I&#x27;ve had-- I even prefer them to the Parisian kind.<p>&quot;Thank God, therefore, for the ice cream. When the Italians came here at the start of the century, they took one swig of the fine pampas milk and knew what they had to do. The ice cream in Buenos Aires is easily the best I have ever eaten, and the parlors that serve it are everywhere.&quot;<p>Yes. The ice cream in Argentina is heavenly, and they will deliver right to your door. The other icecreams I&#x27;ve had don&#x27;t remotely compare.

In the author&#x27;s regex example, if you use a regex subset and later realise that you need the full power of regexes, you can relatively easily switch to a full-fledged parser. But if you choose a simple programming language and later realise that you need a more powerful one, you have to rewrite all your code.<p>Ideally, languages would be scalable so that you can easily flip the &quot;more power&quot; switch without rewriting everything. One way of achieving a scalable language is to consciously design it as a subset or a superset of an existing, widely used language, as with a safe regex parser vs a full regex parser. Another way of achieving scalability is a language that supports the more powerful features, but with a clear barrier that you have to consciously cross, as with reflection in Java (as opposed to making everything dynamically typed).<p>Absent a scalable language, erring on the side of being more restrictive runs the risk of a lot of rework later on.",1447685281

It should perhaps be driven from some concrete and critical use case.<p>For example, I can imagine a language that you can analyse statically to determine not just whether it halts, but how long it will take to do so. As an extreme example, imagine a language with only the four arithmetic operators. No functions, no classes, no references / pointers, no recursion or loops or goto, nothing else. You can statically analyse a program in this language to determine, for example, that if each arithmetic operator takes 1ms to execute, then a program containing 100 of them in its source file will be done in 100ms.<p>Now, what can you add to this language while still keeping it analysable? Maybe functions, as long as they are not recursive. You&#x27;d add only things you can mathematically prove have a bounded runtime. Maybe fixed-length arrays, like int[10], not int[n]. Maybe loops that run a constant number of times, like:<p>repeat (10) {\n...\n}<p>not:<p>repeat(n) {\n...\n}<p>What good would such a language be? Maybe for document macros, where I won&#x27;t be able to hang or crash your document viewer or editor with a macro that runs forever? Maybe there are better uses for such a language than this made up example.<p>Or maybe bounded running time is not the most useful subset of Turing-completeness one can design. Maybe a language that&#x27;s immune from side-channel attacks, if that&#x27;s possible? Or something entirely different?",1447684093

This is a plus and a minus, but in the long run, amortize cost makes that a bigger plus than a minus. My experience so far, iOS devices can live up to at least four major OS updates. That&#x27;s at least 2 years. I think my iPhone 3GS lasted about 4 years before I switched to iPhone 6 (at that time the power of 3GS was simply too slow to handle map and instant messaging).",1447682672

10574428,comment,10572863,10573973,0,0,AJ007,,,"Yeah, &quot;placement doesn&#x27;t work&quot; happens, and it is because another party keeps increasing their bid. Sometimes that was because they blind bid, sometimes it is because they have funds to burn through (Groupon, Zynga, all the big mobile games, Uber, Lyft, all fit in this category, and they bought enough in their time to really move ad rates), other times the company just had a better model and it forced me to make other adjustments to my campaign.<p>Is the question the expansion in adtech companies? If that is so, I think a huge part has been the Facebook traffic dumps to publishers like news sites. Basically the available display inventory something like doubled. That isn&#x27;t sustainable, Facebook fully intends to recapture that external traffic back in to their platform. The drop is already visible to some publishers. Many companies certainly are turning a blind eye to fraud so as to hide the bad news from their clients and investors.<p>At some point the shift from offline to digital ends and the growth moves more in line with GDP. That will bring down valuations. Google and Facebook probably want to integrate the ad model with every human transaction. One could imagine getting in a Google car and saying &quot;pizza&quot; and be driven to the highest bidding pizza shop.<p>Certainly ad costs get baked in to some products in a big way: Coca-Cola, Geico, hotel rooms, for profit universities, and so on. Sometimes the costs are so much the profit center moves to another area, such as investing the float from insurance or maybe just straight up stealing money out of a person&#x27;s bank account (pay day loan lead aggregators selling bank info to criminals, has happened many times, see FTC.)<p>As a whole, I don&#x27;t know how this plays out. If the ad competition is brutal enough the costs will be driven up to the point where the parties not spending money on advertising are just far better deals. If it isn&#x27;t the prices running up, the cost could be offloaded somewhere else like cutting maintenance at a hotel. Eventually the advertiser&#x27;s reputation tanks.<p>These are marketplaces. On a micro level there are many perverse distortions because of some condition at a given time. Over time they should re-balance.<p>Some things like Coca-Cola, which has probably physically harmed and killed people on the scale of cigarettes, just last a really long time. Coca-Cola has a truly perverse combination of trademark law enforcement, addiction (caffeine+sugar), general scientific ignorance by consumers, and a long list of government subsidized cost advantages. All of these strengths save trademark law are being chipped away at right now. Which, at some point it flips and they have the McDonalds problem (toxic brand.)",1447682542

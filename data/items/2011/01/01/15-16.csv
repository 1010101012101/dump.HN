2057731,comment,2057415,2057492,0,0,ant57,,,"Comments like this demonstrate <i>why web _applications_ will lose</i><p>The inertia and individual investment in HTML and JavaScript is so incredibly high that web players (from the browser makers such as Mozilla to the individual web developers) absolutely steadfastly refuse to evolve with changing requirements.<p>The belief that JS+HTML is ""just fine"" and no significant evolution is required to support application development is absolutely incomprehensible; what other application platform available today has seen iteration as glacially slow as the web? The browser makers have consistently stuck to their ""HTML+JS is fine for everyone"" guns, ECMAScript has failed to evolve almost entirely, and no common <i>application</i> development framework or platform has emerged.<p>HTML+JS libraries -- such as jquery -- are just fine for interactive document publishing, but are no replacement for Cocoa, Android, or Qt. The lack of common re-usable and extensible UI components is a travesty. Proponents like to advance the idea that this chaos is a benefit -- choose whatever tools you want -- but the rising popularity and the massive investment in application development on native app stores demonstrates a market desire for something simpler: A common well-defined application development platform is valuable, and the only barrier to adoption in the web world was a trustable distribution mechanism -- app stores.<p>The fact that you think App Stores will fade away is demonstrative of a failure to understand <i>why</i> the app store is so popular -- ease of distribution, easy to use common development platform, ease of payment processing, common UI (instant user familiarity), performance (!), open development platform (no JS sandbox, not all languages must be filtered through JS).<p>Ask yourself why Google has ChromeOS on one hand, Android on the other, and is working on technologies like NaCL that could bring many of the advantages of Android to Chrome?<p>Lastly, hopefully I can pre-empt the ""JS is a common bytecode platform, just target that"" crowd. Yes, you can emulate any other turing machine on top of a turing machine, but that doesn't mean it will be fast, clean, easy to use, easy to debug. It absolutely makes no sense to halt the evolution of the browser as a platform and instead tell everyone to use a <i>high-level language</i> like JavaScript as a common <i>bytecode</i>.<p>[Addendum]<p>I also should mention, anecdotally, that I've had some long-winded conversations with a member of the Chrome App Store team -- me from the perspective of a long-time native developer, them from the perspective of being tasked with coming up with ways to improve the web as an application development platform.<p>From my conversation, which may or may not reflect reality:<p>There seem to be two schools within the Google App Store team. The first (and seemingly most common) belief that there's nothing terminally broken with the DOM, HTML and JavaScript, they just need to find a way to make it easier to implement re-usable UI components, perhaps a common model for namespaces, objects, and other small improvements to JS.<p>The second seems to believe that a fundamental re-imagining is required -- perhaps dropping the DOM entirely in favor of rendering with canvas and a traditional view/event hierarchy. Consider opening the playing field for more languages (eg, via NaCL).<p>I think the competing strategies within Google and the clear differences of popularity between them -- Android, Chrome/ChromeOS/Chrome AppStore -- provide an enlightening view as to the likely future of application development on the <i>internet</i>.",1293896445

Minified JS source is about as ""open"" as LLVM bytecode - you won't read both with your eyes. And they are both standardized, have FOSS implementations etc.<p>Openness vs obscurity is almost completely irrelevant to Javascript vs PNaCl. One can obfuscate code in any language. Openness is important, but it's a completely different matter.<p>> Low level memory access, pointers and the likes are the 'horrors'<p>It seems that everyone are missing the main point of PNaCl. PNaCl is <i>NOT</i> a tool to give programmers a headache with manual memory management. It <i>IS</i> a tool to give them ability to write in Python, Ruby, Perl, Haskell, Go, C++ and so on - in any language that can be compiled to LLVM bytecode. And mix them to their heart's content.<p>PNaCl is - as I see it - primarily, an attempt to get one important thing right - to not misuse JavaScript as a weird sort of bytecode. And to give Web-as-platform so much needed language diversity instead of The One Standard Language (JavaScript).<p>> This seems to imply that the browser should have a compiler that complies the low level bytecode<p>They already do that for a long time. V8, TraceMonkey and Carakan are the examples. The whole point of PNaCl is to give browsers a proper bytecode, and use JavaScript properly - as a programming language, not as universal assembly code for the web.<p>There are many obstacles, unsolved problems and distractions (like x86-only NaCl), but the overall direction is right.",1293896234

2057723,comment,2057415,2057415,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"And so the pendulum has swung back. I believe Mozilla's action is rational assuming my logic is not flawed. See if you can unravel it.<p>Premise: The more indistinguishable a browser gets from its underlying operating system the more of the properties of said system it must share. Thus stretching the nature of the abstraction, making it shallower (till the machine) hence also increasing the probability of leaks in said abstraction.<p>Speciation will occur across system architecture peculiarities and cause splintering of browsers. Destroying their main advantage - which is the strong guarantees it makes on your deployed code being accessible across a vast range of platforms. That is, physical constraints and combinatorial considerations will make it very hard to write code that uses architecture specific optimizations and assumptions while still falling back robustly across all devices. And if it can work everywhere then it must not be directly exposing  such a hardware layer and then, what is the point. The same can be acheived by optimizing javascript JITing. The JITter can take care of that optimal device specific optimized code generator. Google wants to create an OS, Mozilla wants to improve the browser.<p>In particular, as margins from speed, ui and features decrease; each vendor will become incentivized to avoid commodification and distinguish themselves from their competitors  by moving faster than the glacial speeds of standard bodies and introducing incompatibilities. While being slow to pick up those of others. In essence each browser would basically evolve into and become indistinguishable from a current OS with all its pitfalls (isomorphic rather than homomorphic as currently). And if we are targeting specific VMs then we may as well factor out the browsers as they are no longer a vital component of the equation. Completing the cycle. To be restarted with metabrowsers.<p>Seems to me that pushing for native into the browser without carefully considering the tradeoffs is foolish. You cannot have uniformity without sacrificing diversity. This seems like the original Java dream rebooted. But it seems to me that wanting the same UI and code to work everywhere while taking advantage of underlying hardware, while automatically adapting and falling back on visuals and optimizations is a pipe dream. That is of course, until OS's and programs become intelligent and partially alive. At least microbe level intelligence. And virus like adaptibility.<p>Aside: NaCl appears to have a decent amount in common with silverlight. Particularly in terms of tradeoffs, weaknesses and gains.",1293895829

What is the difference between putting someone in jail for producing a particular type of content and censorship?  The FCC fines television stations for saying ""fuck"" on the air or showing female nipples -- is there a difference?  I'd rather my fuck be censored out than fined for it. If it is censored, I don't <i>lose</i> anything.<p>Frankly, if I was producing some kind of illegal content that today would land me in jail, I'd rather the government just censor it and leave me my freedom to walk around and produce other types of content that aren't illegal.<p>I don't see a lot of difference between censorship and threats from the secret service for putting a picture of gwb on your myspace page with a knife stabbed through his hand.

Perhaps it is being drawn between what <i>most</i> of us find acceptable and that which we don't.<p>Perhaps China is drawing the same sort of line in what they require Google to filter?  Perhaps the stuff they censor creates a social environment that most people don't appreciate just like fuck and nipples in the U.S.",1269363137

NO? Well here it is anyway--my hypothesis. I am going to keep it relative to this blog post, although you will find much of what I say below very well can apply to most:<p>Here is what you are quoting from the article with a bit more context ""Later, we went to an engineering job fair at Columbia, and hired a couple of college kids. We didn’t have any cash, but we said, 'How about if we give you an iPhone and pay your bills for a couple of months?' They’re amazing.""<p>SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS/ENGINEERS - let's stereotype
- I see a similarity among many software developers/engineers who comment and get blog posts on HN.  Simply, I find them to be a group where an unprecedented percentage of them do it for the love of it, passion, to achieve the ever elusive mastery, and so on.  They feel it is in their DNA.  They remind me of veterinarians who also are a group that you will find mostly comprised of people who do it foremost because of their love of animals.<p>- They do what they do because they love it.
- They spend an absorbent amount of free time on personal projects because it is (I) doing what they love to do (II) honing their skills (III) solving a need for them or others--mind you, normally without any upfront monetary incentive (IV) and so on and so forth...
- You will always find a blog post or possibly know a developer/engineer where opinion about their ability vs. income are skewed NOT in their favor, just the opposite of other professions where opinion about ability vs. income is typically about the person being overpaid.<p>Psychologically, you could deduce that software developers/engineers are mainly a bunch that is motivated by INTRINSIC value.
(intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Intrinsic_and_extrin...</a> )<p>""COLLEGE KIDS""
Matt didn't say what academic year or program these students were part, but let's make the assumption these students he ""hired"" were developers/engineers and were still not too far from the ""nest"" (parents or guardians still provide support for basic needs).<p>If these assumptions about the students are true, then this becomes almost a perfect storm for Matt Mireles and company's situation. The students he found at this job fair all most certainly were seeking EXPERIENCE over INCOME (intrinsic value).<p>---<p>So you have software developers/engineers that as a group most seem inherently intrinsic + Matt offering a job that has much more intrinsic value and motivation (get experience, do what they love, etc.) than extrinsic (he was offering to cover the expense of something that has arguably become a need/necessity) + students who were motivated to find an opportunity most-likely for intrinsic value (experience) over extrinsic (income) = WIN/WIN.<p>On top of all this, the position Matt and company were in made working for him and his ""cause"" more of an altruistic act, or an intrinsic desire to do something good.<p>Very interesting situation that makes me want to deepen my assessment, argument, and theory as to how this worked for Matt.<p>And by the way, I bet these ""college kids""--because of all this intrinsic""ness""-- were the best hires and decision he could have made, and not because of his situation.",1269362663

I worked on some software for a company doing federal compliance consulting for employee hiring processes and requirements. We found that most people don't read (MM-DD-YYYY) type notifiers most of the time and immigrants were most likely to write dates as DD-MM-YYYY where as those born/raised in the US would write MM-DD-YYYY. When dealing with hiring issues getting those things wrong can lead to fines for the employer, incorrect eligibility for benefits for employees and other issues. What we ended up doing was having the date picker automatically show up and start moving to the date as it was typed in. If you entered 03-05-2010 and you meant May 5th 2010 you would see the calendar on March and then most users would switch to the date picker widget to correct the error.<p>Localized date pickers such as datejs don't solve this particular problem because all that happens is the assumption about what format the date will be entered in changes. So an American in Germany might enter MM-DD-YYYY and the date picker will just assume that it's DD-MM-YYYY because that's the format specified in the de-DE.js file.<p>I agree that flexible text entry fields are preferable, but I've seen several business cases for preventing the user from being able to enter the date any way they want due to the ambiguity in date formats.",1269361567

To me it's strange when people expect Apple to conduct their platform in a wholly different manner than a traditional business.<p>To put the icing on this cake, it would be a non-issue if Opera-for-iPhone simply augmented the built in browser components instead of shipping something which unnecessarily violates the terms of the store.  We could easily see a Firefox, Chrome, or Opera on the iPhone if they used WebKit for their JS and DOM parsing and rendering.  Maybe that is too much to expect from a browser company, but I certainly don't expect companies to pout and stomp their feet when Apple doesn't give them what they want.",1269360749

I would guess that commercial vessels cannot have military on them in order to have access to other countries' ports, but the private security can just disembark before going to national waters.<p>So here is a business proposal then. Lease a large enough vessel. Hire a bunch of guys with guns. Latest and greatest millitary equipment. Add some deterence devices ( high powered water  jets, stink bombs, directed microwave radiation, regular firearms).  Then escort and embark on commercial vessels when they are in international waters. Charge by the hour and world region. Provide security.  Before the commercial vessel sails into its destination port, disembark and wait in international waters to escort the next vessel out to another destination. Would that work?",1269360725

In straight C you start at point A and code until you reach point B. In C++ if you're not careful you create a map of the known world in Portuguese and then start defining what the word ""is"" means.<p>I think back on my C++ production code -- heavy-duty COM stuff, device drivers, embedded software -- and I'd still stick with C++. The trick is that I wouldn't pull in every feature from all over the place.<p>Modern languages -- especially those that have been around for a long time -- have a lot of cruft. Do you need templates on every project? Most likely not. Do you need the STL? Maybe bits of it but not all by any means. Do you need a freaking class graph with 50 nodes to start sorting integers? No, but bad programmers will make one.<p>One of the reasons I love C++ is that <i>it makes you understand how to differentiate the bullshit from the solution</i>. This is the flip-side of the exact point you made about having so many options. Got a problem with allocation? Roll an allocator. C++ is the nuclear bomb of power tools, and there are a million ways to cut your arm off.<p>But for small utilities where you don't touch the metal or interact with some larger, more complex system? C++ isn't the tool.<p>I completely agree that C++ has some really bad/ouch-don't-do-that things in there. I just think that overall the pluses outweigh the minuses for a certain small set of problems. (and coders)",1269360589

If I have a problem that needs a custom data structure and any degree of performance, C is how I can keep from wrestling with metadata bloat and garbage collection.<p>The problems I tend to solve with C are tightly scoped. They tend to admit to libraries, where I can get a foo_t from foo_open(), and then pass it to the foo_bar() functions. They're inherently encapsulated and reusable.<p>There are things from C++ that I tend to want when I'm writing C. Most importantly, I want vector, and I want a lookup table that returns results in sorted order. So, I backported those things from STLPort to C and never looked back.<p>There are also things C++ offers me that I think are bad medicine. Classes with access control (and thus graphs of ""friend"" relationships): not a win over ADT-style C libraries. Smart pointers: not a win over pool allocators (also: knowing how to write a dirt simple allocator is one of <i>the single biggest</i> performance wins I've seen in my career, and C++ makes that hard). Templates: not a win over clear, simple code and discrete components.<p>My experience with C++ is that it creates drag. There are more decision points in C++ than in C. Do I write a class or do I abstract into a template? Do I need a special type or is this just a container of primitive types? Do I decompose into a hierarchy or do I write straight-line code? Do I use a functor or do I use abstract classes? C is a get-things-done language. C++ is a talk-about-getting-things-done language. And then code-about-getting-things-done.<p>It's OK to downvote me.",1269360075

connie_lingus,-27,"Many of the points made in my comments are probably wrong.<p>It is also likely that there are considerations of critical importance that I fail to take into account, thereby invalidating some or all of my conclusions.<p>I have gone to some length to indicate nuances and degrees of uncertainty throughout the comment&#x27;s text encumbering it with an unsightly smudge of possibly, might, may, could well, it seems, probably, very likely, almost certainly. Each qualifier has been placed where it is carefully and deliberately. Yet these topical applications of epistemic modesty are not enough; they must be supplemented here by a systemic admission of uncertainty and fallibility.<p>This is not false modesty: for while I believe that my comments are likely to be seriously wrong and misleading, I think that the alternative views that have been presented in the threads are substantially worse.",1417790939,1450267840

convmedia,7,"Conversation Media is a new company with three products in different stages of development: \nTouchBase  a geolocation app with a twist targeted strictly to parents and their children\nLessons Learned  a community knowledge, education tool\nOddjobs  an interactive social media marketing application whose goal it is to increase click-throughs and the overall effectiveness of advertising that gives a whole new meaning to the term social media marketing.<p>I have been working on Conversation Media since June of '09 and it's my biggest passion of all. I spend all my time working on it, and when I'm not working, I'm thinking about it. I've been lucky enough to bring two other great people on and am in late stages of negotiating with a salesperson as well as bringing on two interns.<p>TouchBase is currently in private release with the goal of attaining 40 parents and 60 children by November 22. We will release the app in the third week of December if all of our plans don't get a major overhaul. Hope to see you there.",1271874896,1452889144

costan,203,"Victor Costan got infected with a passion for coding at the age of 10, and proceeded to earn a M.Eng in Computer science from MIT. Victor also holds a B.S. in Management that he pursued as he fell prey to the belief that great software requires legions of developers manipulating bloated code bases in repetitive ways.<p>Thanks to Paul Graham&#x27;s essays, Ruby, and Rails, he re-discovered the joy of coding, and came back from the dark ways of management. Nowadays, Victor is still crazy about building software that he can impress his friends with, but he also dreams of contributing to making coding even more enjoyable. Victor likes developing mobile and Web 2.0 applications, and occasionally enjoys building some distributed systems behind the apps.<p>When he is not coding, you will most likely find him reading up on some new programming language or software development technique. At times, Victor likes to pretend he&#x27;s mentally sane, and can be seen catching up with friends, watching a movie, or exploring Boston.<p>[ my public key: https://keybase.io/pwnall; my proof: https://keybase.io/pwnall/sigs/I1Vine_PdNepU6Sn-s9TOSooWaVBmAzUVlm_OVuOM0A ]",1241664785,1450207814

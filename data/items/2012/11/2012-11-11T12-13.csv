The typical response I usually get: ""But we got so many resumes, we didn't have time to acknowledge all of them."" WRONG. Acknowledging resumes is your job. Just like doing x, y, and z is my job. Your do your job. Period.<p>#2 Get this, all prospective employers: You may give your employees money but they give you something far more valuable: their time. You can always make more money, but they will never get those 8 hours of their life back. They could have spent that priceless non-recoverable part of their life doing many other things, but they gave it up to you. So show a little respect.<p>Bottom line: Employment (and the process of establishing it) is a two way street. So treat it that way.",1352638773

For anti-semitism to qualify as a euphemism, we'd have to establish that:<p>1. It actually has some substantial meaning outside of 'prejudice/discrimination against jews'
2. It is offensive beyond the offence that one might take from being accused of prejudice/discrimination against jews<p>As for (1), here's some dictionary definitions:<p>Merriam-Webste: hostility toward or discrimination against Jews as a religious, ethnic, or racial group
Collins: prejudice or hostility towards Jews
Cambridge: the strong dislike or cruel and unfair treatment of Jewish people<p>I'm not clear on what sort of historial narrative you could provide that would 'load' this term with substantial additional meaning <i>and</i> offense, but it would have to be very convincing.",1352638671

4769374,comment,4768789,4768789,2,0,deviloflaplace,,,"I interviewed with both Google and Microsoft when I first graduated. MS one was way more smooth but it was largely because they've sent a team out and we did face-to-face interviews. At the end of the day I was told that I was not a good fit. The only thing I was pissed about is that they haven't told me they wanted a Software Tester right away. Since I wasn't interested in such a position, it'd save both parties a huge time.<p>Google one was quite a story. First of all, they reached out to me. Then it took them 3 weeks to schedule an over the phone interview. I've changed like 4 recruiters along the way, and no one told me way. This is a bad practice since for international hires, recruiters are way more important.<p>This is where it gets interesting. My interviewer failed to call me at appointed time, I mailed my recruiters, got a big lie, they scheduled for a week after. It was ok since accidents can happen. Over next to weeks I did two interviews (why on earth can't they schedule them one a day?) and I was told to wait for a committee. Ok, no problem. After 10 days, and a pissed off email, they told me that I had to get a 3rd one. Another week of waiting, and interviewer failed to call again! I was raging by that time. Another week. The interviewer failed to call again. I wrote an email telling them to not to bother with excuses. Right before I hit send, interviewer calls. I was raging so the interview was a bust. They waited 2 weeks to give me a response.<p>Moral of the story: If you need to have 3 or more interviews do them in a short time. In that 2.5 months time I've did so many things, Google became irrelevant, a joke for me. I do get that hiring is hard, as I'm doing it myself; but I always try to return to an applicant in a weeks time. Still now and then Google recruiters ping me over Linkedin. I've told every single one to send an offer right away and skip the interview process. I get the silent treatment =)",1352637889
4769373,comment,4759642,4761231,1,0,davidkatz,,,"Sorry, I don't see the offense in framing a discussion around one instance of something. Don't get me wrong, if someone claims to be fighting for a general cause and then repeatedly talks about one instance, that's wrong. But I really don't see a problem with someone offering a story about one instance. At no point did the OP imply that there was no discrimination against other groups.<p>Claiming that the Holocaust (I'm guessing you don't like that word either) was the worst catastrophe in all of history is a different matter. Now you're dealing with a statement of fact that should at least in theory be either 'right' or 'wrong'. In practice though, I don't think it makes any sense to split hairs around wether it was the 'worst' catastrophe in human history. Who cares, it was pretty damn bad. It's hard to see why you would be offended - there's plenty of defensible views of the word 'catastrophe' that could make the holocaust the 'worst' catastrophe, and if by some other reasonable view of 'catastrophe' the holocaust only comes in at number 7, why would you view it as offensive if someone disagreed?<p>Same goes for your insistence on the right way to call 'prejudice against jews', where you also manage to find offense. Any mainstream dictionary will define anti semitism as something around discrimination or prejudice against Jews, which would make it's use in this discussion 100% legitimate.<p>Perhaps you could enlighten us - what exactly is the problem with Jews talking about ways in which they were hurt as a group in the past?",1352637884

I think that people are relaying Linus's opinion on desktops so much because he's sharing our thought process and gives us an opportunity to spread our own opinion through his fame, rather than just following everything he says just because of his kernel expertise.<p>Look at the reaction people had when Gnome 3 was introduced, and Unity in Ubuntu. People didn't wait for Linus to complain against those changes driven by UI designers gone insane.<p>Lots, and lots of linux users had the SAME reaction Linus had, BEFORE he even publicly talked about it. I went to Gnome 2 from the KDE4 transition since I liked KDE3 but hated KDE4, and went to Xfce after the Gnome 3 and Unity debacle. And I didn't wait for Linus to talk about his thoughts on the linux desktop to switch everytime something bugged me.<p>Aaron Seigo is asking us to not care about Linus opinion ? But <i>we</i> don't give a crap about yours, man, you're the reason why KDE4 went to hell, the man behind Plasma. After so many years acting like you know better what your users want than they do you're getting all hurt when people listen to someone like Linus instead of you ? the thing about Linus is, he's just a user like the rest of us rather than a desktop developer, but with his fame he can make his opinion reach your ears and it seems you don't quite like what regular users think of your ""innovations"".",1352636349

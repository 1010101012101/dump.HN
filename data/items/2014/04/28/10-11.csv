The biggest of Tech IPOs are chicken feed compared to the money going through New York on a daily basis.  If you want to be at the top of finance, you have to be in New York.  Anybody who wants to work to the top, will end up in New York.  The reverse applies to Tech, which is why both will stay top of their game for their respective current strengths.<p>It&#x27;s completely wrong to think of New York in terms of just JP Morgan as it is wrong to think of Silicon Valley as just Apple.<p>New York doesn&#x27;t care about the origin of the wealth.

The good news is that there&#x27;s huge amount of research going into advanced energy technology:  new methods of capturing, converting, storing, or using it.  And virtually <i>ALL</i> of it is absolute, total, complete, 2000% bullshit in terms of actual informational value.<p>In one case (the Haberno enhanced geothermal well project in Australia), I found that reading the company in question&#x27;s own financial filings with the Australian securities regulator was far more informative than the ... whitewashed is putting too pretty a face on it ... completely useless press &quot;progress&quot; report.  If attaining 2% of your initial generation goal in 5x the time and 10x the budget is &quot;success&quot;, well, I don&#x27;t know what to say.<p>The problem is when the crap reporting of useless bullshit makes it difficult to see through crap reporting of the <i>good</i> stuff out there.  The US Navy Research Lab&#x27;s recently (past month) publicized research on electricity-to-fuel synthesis from seawater was <i>abysmal</i>.  But the underlying technology and story are actually among the better prospects out there in terms of not only providing moderate-scale liquid fuel sources for the future, but very large (national or global) potential, with high-but-tractable costs, and with applications to utilizing surplus intermittent generating capacity for fuel synthesis and long-term storage (diesel fuel stores well).

Employers have capital, they have inertia so they can absorb a lot more risk. There are fewer employers than employees so it is easy for them to form a cartel or engage in price fixing. This especially goes for low end jobs, where a small number of large corporations make up much of the retail and fast food market. Unemployed individuals are under a lot of pressure to find employment quickly, and they know there is a lot of competition. So, employers can set wages artificially low. This power is not absolute, which explains why not every job is at minimum wage. However, this is an observable effect. The gap between rich and poor is ever widening, the middle class is eroding away, yet all the while production has been increasing. Wages are being driven down artificially low.<p>I wanted to ask &quot;where does it all end?&quot; but then I realised from the rest of your comment, you actually seem okay with slavery. Which is odd really, because you argue about human rights, but the right to freedom of movement is actually a far more fundamental and clear cut human right than the right to form contracts and do trade. In fact, if your ideals about the right to form contracts result in other people losing their right to freedom of movement, then that&#x27;s a clear sign that you have lost your way.",1398680603

I told them that would never happen on time and between bus jitter and kernel scheduling we could never pull this off.<p>I dug deeper and found that the application could figure out 5ms in advance the GPS time code of when it needed to fire,  With that in mind what they really needed was the ability for the firmware to have a time trigger that was programmable through the device driver from the application.  That way the dedicated board would fire the pulse exactly when the application wanted it fired.<p>Basically I turned their logic on it&#x27;s head and it fixed the problem.

There&#x27;ll likely be optimisations with respect to node lookups, but the fundamental issue of locality of access is still there: it&#x27;s simply a hard problem in graph data storage.  Depending on the flexibility/declaritiveness of the query language provided, there&#x27;s still the issue of intermediate result set explosion that also plagues triple stores.<p>This isn&#x27;t meant to say that graph databases aren&#x27;t very useful: native graph stores will certainly offer some useful technical specialisations and ease of use benefits - it&#x27;s more to say that there&#x27;s not (afaik) anything wondrous under the hood that means that native graph databases fundamentally solve the performance challenges of graph-structures-on-relational-dbs.",1398679942

I think the rpi makes a better stab at being a general purpose computer than an android tablet, and I think that the wayland port should improve it further. However I agree it&#x27;s no replacement for a power hungry intel box.<p>Post the instructions here, I will test on mine to see whether it&#x27;s a general problem or just your box - there have been faulty ones shipped, but it&#x27;s a tiny percentage of the total.<p>Having threads deleted seems to be a common theme on popular forums, it doesn&#x27;t usually signal a cover up - the moderators can take exception to your tone and then you have no recourse.<p>When my rpi posts it seems to look for a hdmi cable, if none is present it outputs to the yellow composite - how does yours differ?<p>I can&#x27;t understand if you mean brownouts in terms of power or in terms of connectivity - what was dropping out?<p>I can&#x27;t say I have any experience with embedded systems but typically when people say that they aren&#x27;t referring to computers that the rpi is comparable to - e.g. hdmi out, usb, ethernet.

So, for example, page layout is still done with Django&#x27;s template system, and new page types are just Django models with some additions. As a result, using Wagtail is actually not massively different to the DIY route, at a functional level - but you get the extra bells and whistles like revision tracking and workflow as well.",1398679731

7659031,comment,7657701,7657701,14,0,jwr,,,"I have considered and purchased a number of commercial libraries and development tools over the years (in particular, some Lisp implementations/compilers and databases, and some libraries), so I&#x27;ll drop in a few notes on the subject:<p>* Price does not necessarily correspond to quality/capabilities. I have seen very expensive software that was disappointing, and very cheap (or free) software that was impressive.<p>* Paying a lot for software does not mean you will get the support you expect. You <i>will</i> get the attention, but your problems will not necessarily get fixed. This is just a business reality: some problems are too expensive to fix.<p>* A commercial licensing agreement you enter into is usually a huge problem that crops up later. It&#x27;s baggage that you will carry along and will need to look into regularly: when you make a huge new sale, when you sign an escrow agreement with a customer, when you go through due diligence, or when you sell your company.<p>* A licensing agreement with revenue sharing is an even bigger problem. Setting apart the management costs, it is something that not all of your investors/partners/buyers will approve of.<p>* Commercial software, in general, has fewer users than free software. Which means you are more likely to end up the first or the <i>only</i> user of certain functionality. Not a good place to be in when you have systems to ship.<p>* If a company does not have a clear pricing structure, the negotiations might take too long to be worthwile. Just hearing a price is sometimes difficult and requires exchanging multiple E-mails („let us assess your needs so that we can provide you with a custom quote”).<p>* If you build your product on top of a commercial library, take into account that you are now dependent on the company you bought it from. Unless you have the source code and the rights to modify it — but even then, if the company goes under or gets bought, you might end up holding the bag and having to develop and support the code you bought.<p>Put another way, when I make a decision to use a commercial library, in general I will avoid it, unless:<p>* the pricing is transparent and immediately available,<p>* there is no revenue sharing, quarterly reporting, etc,<p>* there are few licensing restrictions,<p>* there are enough users I know of that I can assume the library has been used and tested,<p>* I get the source code,<p>* I get the rights to use the code after the company goes under or gets sold.",1398679284

8448717,comment,8447768,8448459,0,0,dragontamer,,,"The better social safety nets are damn obvious. Much of Europe (including UK) has free education up to College-level, truly universal healthcare (State-Sponsored for all citizens).<p>As for income inequality, the statistics are pretty telling.<p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/08/news/economy/global_income_inequality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/08/news/economy/global_income_i...</a><p>But it is the goal of liberalism to have strong social safety nets and equalize pay to all. The US has a different culture with different values... tending towards the &quot;conservative&quot; and with great trust in market forces.<p>&quot;Obamacare&quot; is seen as Socialism and half the population seems to hate it. But Obamacare only establishes rules for the free market to operate under... standardizing health care plans across insurance companies. There is no state-sponsored health care from the law, and yet people are still worried about socialism.<p>Obamacare is closer to Credit Card reform, in that it forced all credit card companies in the US to standardize upon the &quot;Annual Percentage Rate&quot; / APR so that everyone can comparison shop across credit cards. With Obamacare, all insurance companies have to offer similar plans (bronze, silver, gold, platinum), and they must cover certain provisions (contraceptives make the controversy here). So now when you see a &quot;Bronze&quot; plan from say... Aetna Health Insurance, you know it is similar to &quot;Bronze&quot; plans from Kaiser Permanente.<p>As far as the &quot;Socialism&quot; goes... US has had Medicare / Medicaid for nearly 80 years now. The &quot;socialist&quot; part of our health care system has existed for a very long time, but no Republican seems to want to attack it.<p>But inside the US, <i>any</i> new laws upon the market is seen as a &quot;Market Distortion&quot; and is criticized as &quot;Socialism&quot;. Because most American&#x27;s don&#x27;t even know the meaning of that word. The absurdity in the &quot;Net Neutrality&quot; argument is more proof of the free market sheeple ignoring important issues and placing their trust in the free market instead.",1413208719

8448714,comment,8446597,8448431,0,0,tel,,,"Monad/Monoid are a different category of things from transducers—think of them more like an interface than a thing. For instance, a basic model of Transducer is as follows<p><pre><code>    type Trans a b = forall r . (r -> b -> r) -> (r -> a -> r)\n</code></pre>\nand it turns out that this is isomorphic to (e.g. an optimization of) the list Kleisli arrow<p><pre><code>    type KleiList a b = a -> [b]\n</code></pre>\nand lists are monads. For a slightly different reason, this argumentation leads me to believe that Transducers ought to be monads via the Reader/List transformer stack. I haven&#x27;t verified it, however.<p>Transducers could be monoids, too. You&#x27;d need to have two operations like so<p><pre><code>    zero :: Transducer a b\n    add  :: Transducer a b -> Transducer a b -> Transducer a b\n</code></pre>\nand perhaps there would be necessary restrictions on the choices of `a` and `b`. It&#x27;s immediately obvious we could make this work if `a` and `b` were equal<p><pre><code>    zero :: Transducer a a\n    add  :: Transducer a a -> Transducer a a -> Transducer a a\n</code></pre>\nas this is now just the &quot;identity&quot; transducer and transducer composition which satisfy all the laws of monoid.",1413208671

However well intentioned VCs are they are more goal oriented.<p>Bell being huge and not unlike government organizations had bell labs - i am sure you all know that transistor came from there. Idea for bell labs was to put many great scientists together and wait for things to happen. Internet is the other thing - one cannot imagine private money investing that much in such nebulous goal - where everything from microcircuits to software stack had to be developed to birth the Internet.<p>VC doing science is not a bad thing but in the long run government can provide a steadier hand to people that do science than market driven entities. Financial market cycles are detrimental to projects that run on 20-30 year span or clusters of research projects.<p>If VCs can do a hybrid model where government can step in during lean times and help science projects survive with minimal bearacratic interference I think that could the best IMO.",1413208457

Not all DNS requests are cached by the OS, but by providing your own caching resolver, you can cache all requests used by any application on your network. 4. You can provide your own ranges and domains for internal hosts so that resolving names for private IPs reduces resolution time in local apps. 5. You can control negative caching and TTLs. 6. You can prevent unscrupulous DNS providers from redirecting NX lookups to internal [ad-supported] services. 7.

You might want to change your form of autodidacticism in order to draw a larger distinction between the two.<p>For example, consider the two statements &quot;Seems like a radioactive power source with that type of protection.&quot; and &quot;Odd, no?&quot; They imply that you know enough to make a reasonably confident statement about 1) the different types of clothing used for different hazmat situations and what&#x27;s appropriate for space operations, and 2) that you understand enough about space power systems to judge what&#x27;s odd.<p>You received many responses pointing out that these are standard chemical hazmat suits for this sort of task, with decades of examples and pointers to multiple space agencies, and not similar to what&#x27;s used for space-based radionuclear power sources.<p>That should have been a pointer that you don&#x27;t have enough knowledge to be able to say if something is &quot;odd&quot;, as regards spacecraft. Your default assumption should be that nothing is odd, and that it&#x27;s your lack of understanding which is the source of confusion. Resolve that first before looking outside for the point of confusion. Eg, &quot;Thanks for the comments. I don&#x27;t know much about spacecraft. Could you also help me understand why ... ?&quot;<p>You could even have done so in your original question. There was no need to add &quot;Seems like a radioactive power source with that type of protection.&quot;<p>While on the other hand, those who believe (perhaps correctly, perhaps falsely) that they&#x27;ve uncovered something secret will use that sort of phrasing to imply that something is secret, even though they don&#x27;t have the ability to outright say that something is secretive without taking the large chance that doing so will reveal their lack of actual knowledge on the topic.",1413207789

8448653,comment,8448265,8448555,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The value of a common design language thing really can&#x27;t be overestimated, I think. I&#x27;m working on a new wiki, a new UI for our products, and a new Drupal deployment for our forums/issues/shopping cart. Making all of these look consistent would have been unrealistic on our budget in the past...given that there are now Bootstrap themes for Drupal and MediaWiki (with varying degrees of completeness and quality), it becomes much more reasonable. We may still fail to provide perfect consistency, but it&#x27;ll be a lot closer than was possible in the past.<p>Also, the &quot;bloat&quot; arguments that I keep seeing are kind of no-op arguments, used against languages, operating systems, applications, etc. when you don&#x27;t have useful criticisms. &quot;Bloat&quot; means, &quot;it has features I don&#x27;t use&quot;. Which is true of most things that have been in development for a while. It also ignores the ability to roll a custom Bootstrap which is missing the stuff you don&#x27;t need. Sure there are some inter-dependencies, but nothing too offensive.<p>I like that we now have a higher level abstraction for UI components. I hate it when desktop application designers throw together their own UI components and ignore the OS guidelines and API. That&#x27;s not to say there isn&#x27;t room for innovation and novel UI concepts. Just that if you&#x27;re building a thing with buttons and tables and forms and crap like that, it probably doesn&#x27;t need to look completely unlike anything else that has ever existed...and it&#x27;s probably bad design if it <i>does</i> look completely unlike anything else that has ever existed.",1413207763

8448638,comment,8448058,8448058,0,0,byuu,,,"Oh, wow. I know most people dislike C++ language extensions, given how complex the language already is. But as a library author, I truly believe this is the most powerful and useful addition we can add to the language now. I&#x27;ve been wanting this exact thing for years, but unfortunately you can&#x27;t even do it as a preprocessor due to the complexity of ADL and SFINAE on lookups.<p>First, I like Herb Sutter&#x27;s propsal more ( <a href=""http://isocpp.org/files/papers/N4165.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isocpp.org/files/papers/N4165.pdf</a> ), as Bjarne&#x27;s proposal to favor x.f() when encountering f(x) would be a breaking change. However, Herb&#x27;s suggestion to accept x in any position in f (eg x.f(a, b) could match f(a, x, b)), in order to wrap libc interfaces such as FILE* more easily, I feel is a mistake. I&#x27;d rather we keep the complexity of parsing down and write wrapper headers around libc to support the new syntax instead (which is also a wonderful opportunity to get the functions and #defines out of the global namespace.)<p>Onto utility ... as stated, nearly all of my time writing C++ is spent creating libraries. This is always a huge struggle: you don&#x27;t want users to have to remember that some functions are class::func() and others are func(class&), and indeed it makes for some really ugly code, eg c(b(a()) instead of a().b().c(). Further, since C++ classes cannot be reopened, it&#x27;s a real problem to just rely on users to extend your classes to add desired features. Person A makes class fooObject : object, person B makes class barObject : object. But now fooObject and barObject are incompatible, unless you slice back to object, and lose the whole point of your extensions.<p>Unified function call syntax (UFCS) solves this nicely: member functions are now only those that need access to private state. Your classes are much smaller, which aids in encapsulation. Further, you don&#x27;t have to code everything but the kitchen sink into your classes anymore, the user can simply add functionality that they need. Or you can offer the extensions piecemeal in separate headers. So not only do we get UFCS, we also get a nicer form of C# extension methods for free.<p>Further, it&#x27;s a real boon to IDE auto-completion features to be able to know available functions after object.[function] than it is after function([object]; the former is much easier. Imagine an IDE trying to auto-complete &quot;begin(&quot;, for instance. That list is going to be hopelessly long.<p>Lastly, it will be very interesting to see what rules they put in place around this and primitive types. If you can have square(int&), then you could call int x = 5; int y = x.square(); But even more interesting will be if this is allowed for constants: int x = 5.square(); string y = &quot;hello&quot;.toUppercase(); ... there is the potential to allow C++ to be a truly object oriented language where everything is an object, if this is done right.<p>On that note, I haven&#x27;t seen much talk around the implementation of f(x), but they definitely need to allow for both x::f() -> f(x&) and x::f() const -> f(const x&). I&#x27;m also a little concerned about x->f() -> f(x*), and how that might play in with overloaded operator-> that you find in smart pointer classes.<p>For those in favor of f(x, y) over x.f(y), please consider the history of ambiguity around operator arguments. strcat is (target, source) whereas rename is (source, target). There are thousands of examples like this. Putting the target before the function call is an absolutely wonderful way to remove the burden of having to remember each and every function&#x27;s exact ordering. For cases where there is no clear &quot;target&quot;, regular function call syntax can still be used, eg intersect(x, y)<p>But, complexities aside ... I really hope this feature makes it in, and that the naysayers to all language extensions do not ruin this. It will completely change the way I program in C++.",1413207572

That makes sense since you list several other non-IBS related disorders (&quot;stomach flu (sic) / food poisoning&quot; as well as gastroparesis).  The thing that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me is why you attribute these things to IBS?<p><i>If simply upping my fiber solved the problem then I would be set, but fiber lead to more gas and pain for me.</i><p>There is nothing &quot;simple&quot; about increasing your fiber in a manner to solve IBS.  As I mentioned in my original comment, it takes actual work.  First, you have to eschew eating anything at all throughout the day that doesn&#x27;t have dietary fiber.  Second, you must gradually increase your fiber intake over a period of a year to avoid gas buildup and pain.  Third, you must actively seek out fiber rich foods to eat throughout the day.  As I said, there is absolutely nothing simple about it.<p><i>This all happened to me after I went swimming in a river with friends and got ill later in the evening.</i><p>Again, I&#x27;m questioning why you think this has anything to do with IBS.

Maybe for your program there are some missing methods that would really handy to add, like maybe .urlencode().  Today in C++ you can&#x27;t though: if the method isn&#x27;t mentioned in the original definition of std::string in its header file it&#x27;s permanently missing.<p>This leads to pressure to make a custom version of the class, either inheriting or encapsulating the original.

APU failure.  Control system failure.  Total computer crash.  Total electrical system failure.  Exploding main engine takes out the back 15 feet of the shuttle.  Engine gimble hydraulics jams one engine full one direction, maybe damaging the other engine nozzles by smooshing into them.  Window blows out, probably taking out the deck crew but maybe the guys below survive.  Back when the shuttle was in the commercial space truck biz, one of the boost stages in the cargo bay ignites (well that probably takes out the whole ship, how about the vibration of launch causes a short circuit that causes an electrical fire or propellant breach that damages stuff passing thru the bay, like electrical power and control lines.)",1413205634

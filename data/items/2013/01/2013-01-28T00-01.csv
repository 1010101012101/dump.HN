The similar argument that science is particularly suited to the religion of western  europe suffers from similar flaws and is generally overdrawn.<p>It isn't really accurate to describe science ""as flowering in muslim lands"" when in reality the patronage of rulers with disposable income was far more important than any religious beliefs.

You ignore everything that is not tested.  This gets you children that pass the tests.  But it ignores all the other work that schools should be doing, and it reduces education to the worst, least inspiring, mechanical drudge work.<p>> <i>I don't know off the top of my head whether the latter should be learned by 3rd grade. Ultimately setting the goals of our educational system is up to the various bureaucrats in the school system.</i><p>They can't agree.  That's why I listed nonsense words in one of the requirements. There's an argument about whether phonics or whole-word approaches are better, even though we have good research showing that phonics is better.  And so when you look at phonics methods (include nonsense words in the tests), you get disagreement in the phonics camp, and you also have all the non-phonics people piling on.<p>But this should be easy to discover, right?  We have millions of children learning to read each year.  We randomise them, we set up a control group, we give other groups different methods.  Then we test. (assuming we can get agreement on what and how to test.)<p>I can't imagine any politician agreeing to that.",1359334436

I'll spell out the analogy though: Anything worth trying once for, is worth trying twice for.<p>The context of the case is the war on drugs. That's the pretense for the government trying to steal his hotel, and I get the analogy. The problem is the premise. Even if everything worth trying once is worth trying twice, that doesn't do anything to prove you were right the first time, without which trying again is just compounding the error.<p>>Judges throw out cases on non-obvious reasoning all the time.<p>And is that what happened in this case? Because it seems like in this case it was ""obvious"" that the government was trying to take this man's hotel because it had no mortgage, they expected him to have insufficient liquid assets to successfully contest a seizure and when law enforcement seizes assets they get the resale value added to their budgets.",1359334424

One of my friends had an acquaintance who thought it was amusing to 'hack' their chat client. It wasn't particularly complicated or malicious, but she would do it persistently every night and this made it impossible to chat. We knew who it was because they would quite openly brag about it. But we also knew who their dialup ISP was. So we faked an email written by the ISP telling this person to stop what they were doing or legal action would be taken etc. We just changed the 'from' address in the email from a throaway hotmail account. They could have easily worked out that the email was fake, but we figured they would be so mortified that they wouldn't get that far. We were right.

5126457,comment,5124060,5124710,2,0,saurik,,,"This implies that they are only being paid for their added value, when in real situations they are often getting all of the benefit as they are in control of the customer relationship at that point; if a system like redis allows you to build something really complex and profitable with only a few days of effort (whether it be another developer tool or a website for end users that allows you to comment on cat pictures), when it took antirez an immense amount of time to build redis itself, then the question is whether the value you got for your profitable business is really yours to have, or whether ""by all rights"" a good chunk of it should have gone to antirez (who then might use it to cause more open code to exist, such as working on redis).<p>In this case, honestly, antirez's opinion seems to have an internal contradiction. On the one hand, he is perfectly fine with someone taking the things he's done, forking them for their purposes, making something theoretically valuable out of it with minimal effort, and then sequestering all of the value. On the other hand, his article clearly states that what he feels is missing in the world of open source is that the people who make the systems that people rely on to build their empires don't get paid for it, and don't get any money in return to pay their time to maintain their software. As someone who made this same mistake on various occasions, this really seems like someone who has caused their own problem: giving something away for free under the least restrictive license possible, and then wondering why they are unable to hold on to any of the value from it.<p>To quote his article:<p>> In my opinion instead what the open source does not get back in a fair amount is money, not patches. The new startups movement, and the low costs of operations of many large IT companies, are based on the existence of so much open source code working well. Businesses should try to share a small fraction of the money they earn with the people that wrote the open source software that is a key factor for their success, and I think that a sane way to redistribute part of the money is by hiring those people to just write open source software (like VMware did with me), or to provide donations.<p>^ antirez: If you really believe this, why not encode it into your license? You could easily say ""if you want to use this for a project larger than X or making more than Y, you have to be willing to hire me in a support capacity"". Alternatively, why not use one of the existing ""tried and trusted"" open source business models, such as ""redis is awesome, but it is under a restrictively-free license; if you wish to use it for a purely selfish and commercial purpose, you thereby must contact me to get a special re-licensing of this program for your purposes, the royalties from which can be used to pay costs associated with redis, hire people (including myself) to work on redis, and generally can compensate the community for the success that using our product will bring you"".

Here's the list of things I've tried:<p>Rosetta Stone - probably spent about 2 months working my way through this.<p>Language school - 6 weeks, spent most of it feeling utterly confused and wondering why they were trying to teach me Spanish, using fluent Spanish...<p>Pimsleur - this did really improve my accent and some of the words I'd been using along the way started to become second nature. Still a long way from conversational though, did this for about 4 weeks.<p>Michelle Thomas - by far the best of the bunch for learning grammar, by the end of the basic and advanced courses I pretty much knew the various past/future tenses. Great base, but conversation still isn't happening...<p>Memrise - yeah actually, this really did help my vocabulary, spent about a month using it before christmas, learnt a lot and I can see me using this in the future to expand my vocab.<p>Duolingo - a good base for getting started, not sure how much if sticks though, it has the ""lack of context"" problem.<p>Private tutor -  this is hands down the winner. I've only had a few lessons but I find this really works for me. The big difference is you can have conversations with complete understanding of every word that is said by either of you i.e. if you don't understand a word they say, they can write it down for you, explain what it means (falling back to english if necessary but generally avoided) and then move on. Likewise, if you make an error in something you've said it's corrected on the spot, often going off on tangent to explain some grammar before continuing the conversation. If you want to learn at a consistent pace I think a private tutor is really the only way to go. You're trying learn to converse in a foreign language, until computers can do the conversation bit the other approaches are all going to fall short of the mark. That's not to say they don't have value, and they're obviously far cheaper than a private tutor but without the conversation part they're never going to be enough to get you speaking fluently.",1359333552

Or to get children to read a sentence, and obtain meaning from it?</i><p>I don't know off the top of my head whether the latter should be learned by 3rd grade. Ultimately setting the goals of our educational system is up to the various bureaucrats in the school system.<p>However, regardless of what the goal is, you still haven't given an way to game the system apart from ""teach kids to read [words/sentences]"".<p><i>While schools may not have stopped teaching students to read they have cut out other parts of the curriculum to focus on what's being tested.</i><p>Indeed - if the school system is not achieving their primary goals, they should cut secondary goals and focus on the primary ones. That's a good thing.<p><i>Do you spend extra time and money on the few strugglers (some of whom are going to fail whatever you do), or do you concentrate on the majority (and get most of them through the test and thus look good)?</i><p>This depends on what the goals of the school system are. If you want to ignore the strugglers, set the goal to be maximizing this function:<p><pre><code>    student_scores.max() 
</code></pre>
If you want to help the strugglers and ignore the strivers, choose this one:<p><pre><code>    student_scores.min()

Choose this one if helping a struggler is equally important with helping a striver:<p><pre><code>    student_scores.mean()

This one is like the previous, but strugglers get a bit of extra weight:<p><pre><code>    log(student_scores).mean()

I had a senior programmer mentor me and usually ended up doing little, usually week long, tasks for him. He was a great guy and really made this enjoyable.<p>His main task was the cover system. I helped him with this as an introduction to the game engine. Once I had a grasp of the existing code and demonstrated that I was competent, he offloaded some of his simpler tasks on me. This usually involved modifying the game editor for the artists.<p>The modification I remember most clearly was enabling the artists to control the camera's FOV and the depth of field effect. The game engine didn't support this so I had to use a hidden bone in the models to control these values.<p>Working at Eidos Montreal as an intern was a great experience. It enabled me to work in video games (childhood dream) before realizing that it wasn't quite for me (I'm now trying my hand at entrepreneurship, it's all the rage).",1359332507

I think he couldn't afford his medication because he was homeless and without work. He often said as a software contractor they would go without work and being stiffed by clients, but still owe the money to the IRS because it is income even if he isn't paid for it.<p>After he lost his contracts and couldn't collect on money owed him that he was stiffed on, his web sites got taken down, and then auctioned off, and they had the only evidence on them that could have cleared him and proven his mistreatment. I think some domain squatters got them because they were at the top of certain Google searches and they bought the domains for high traffic advertising.<p>The mystery is this isn't the first time he's been in that jail, he was in before and no charges listed, and 90 days later he was released, only to be rearrested over and over again and released, and then finally they got some charge of threatening with intent to terrorize or something. I have no idea why. I think it is a BS charge like they did with Aaron Swartz and others, but I am not 100% sure on that.<p>I thought I would cite his case as it is relevant to the topic as a worse case scenario that happens when one isn't paid for their contracted work.",1359331504

5126294,comment,5126020,5126242,1,0,AaronBBrown,,,"I suppose that depends on your definition of ""database."" This argument is very close to the No True Scotsman fallacy.  Nowhere in the definition of ""database"" does it say that it won't default to truncating your data when you try to stuff it into a field that is too small.  MongoDB, Riak, VoltDB, PostgreSQL, and CouchBase are all ""databases"" and they all have varying levels of strictness.<p>""it's the wrong tool"" is an opinion and it is unsupported by history.  It many cases, it's exactly the right tool and users are given the power to control the level of strictness they they require.  Want to allow GROUP BYs that don't include all non-aggregate columns?  Sure, you can do that.  Or not.  Want MySQL to accept what you give it and throw warnings instead of errors?  Yep, you can do that, too.  Or not.<p>The defaults are bad.  No one will defend that.  They are also easy to change.  A privilege level allowing/denying the ability to change the sql_mode would be a welcome addition, also.  Yet, MySQL is a capable tool that does some things really well, something things not so well, and some things terribly.  Just like every other product out there. It is a tool.  It works well for many, but not all cases.  Apparently, you find it inadequate for your particular needs.  I get that.  You shouldn't use it.",1359331291

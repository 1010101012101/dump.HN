So I guess there is hope.<p>If one tag opens another, it's a child of the first, so they should thread together.<p>Javascript already has threads anyway (setTimer, and events), they are just serially scheduled - on a single core it's identical to regular threads. So you already have to deal with concurrency issues in javascript apps (although it's not as bad as full threading since I think a single function is allowed to run to completion before something else is scheduled).",1219600547

We then no longer remember how life could have existed without them.  Before the age of the university, young people would meet interesting other people through fraternal associations, clubs, coffee houses, and pubs.  In these societies you could find a rousing chess game, talk politics, start a charitable activity or even purchase group health insurance.  The University of Pennsylvania, was originally founded by Ben Franklin as society for his friends to promote their mutual intellectual advancement.  The cost was nearly free.  The idea that we need government to subsidize ""making friends"", that finding a group of intellectual peers requires spending $50K a year in tuition, is preposterous.",1219599750

285269,comment,285066,285229,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Good point about Smalltalk. Not all IDEs are created equal, nor are IDEs in themselves necessarily a bad thing.<p>To be fair, all good languages can be used to create something that's more complex than humans can understand. That's what they're for. Languages in which complex things are impossible to create are incredibly frustrating.<p>Good software systems have three features: Most of the complexity is invisible at any given time (Ruby on Mac OS X is horrendously complex, but the author of <i>Hello, World</i> in Ruby needn't know that); the visibly complex things are built out of conceptually simple parts (e.g. Smalltalk Objects), and the visible complexity is <i>needful</i>: You build complex things to solve complex problems, but you don't bolt a lot of complicated stuff onto the side of <i>Hello, World</i> just because there are automated tools to help you do so. I think Java fails test two, and I'm certain it fails tests one and three: My impression of a page like this:<p><a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList...</a><p>... is that now a beginner can't even instantiate a simple list of objects in Java 5 without understanding generics and their syntax. Or, rather, I'm sure he can, but he does it by typing in some code, watching his IDE complain at him, and accepting the fix that the IDE suggests without bothering to understand it. And so begins his Java career, a career which will largely consist of standing by as his IDE conducts an automated, <i>visible</i> running dialogue with his language's increasingly complex spec. And for what benefit?",1219599501

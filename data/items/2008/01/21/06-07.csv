101467,comment,101380,101414,0,0,Nicolay77,,,"<i>Separating interfaces from implementations is ALWAYS good design.</i><p>If I understand correctly, a pure virtual interface avoids inline functions. And there can be a lot of one-liner inline functions in a large project.<p>So there's a diference between standard good-design and this yet-another-thing-that-became-a-pattern.",1200897738

Trying to come up with a per-user or per 1k user metric for the server costs.  I'll take a look at your links and post back when I get some data - thx",1200895814

It's just entertainment with a few extra morsels for hackers.  When you look at it that way, it's easily in the top 20% of what comes out of Hollywood.",1200895235

Are we talking 1000 hits per second?  Or are we talking about 1000 unique people viewing some portion of your site/app at a given time?<p>If it's the latter, you can get away with a lot less.<p>Also, if you have shared-anything, it will become a bottleneck long before the mongrels.  Your database especially will have to be replicated (for read-mostly apps), or sharded (for heavy read-write apps).<p>If it's a read-mostly app, consider aggressively caching fragments or even pages.  (1K users hitting static pages will just hit Apache, given the right set of mod_rewrite rules, and you can have a lot more Apache processes (or threads; is Rails threadsafe these days?) running on a given server than mongrels (which, when I last used Rails, were very resource-hungry).<p>Consider also ways to extend the functionality of cached/static pages.  You could have mod_rewrite check to see if the user has a login cookie and only then hit the non-cached app, OR you could have client-side javascript on the static cached page check for the same cookie and only then display the login name or do an XMLHttpRequest to the server (which then may cache a static html subpage named for that username, which can then be checked by mod_rewrite as well).<p>Just don't trust non-signed user cookies for looking up private information, or for making any database writes.  Signed cookies, however, are a great alternative to centralized sessions (just remember to encrypt anything that you want the user to store, but not see: signing just protects against tampering).  Jam the user's IP address into the signed cookie text and guard against replay attacks, as well!",1200895215

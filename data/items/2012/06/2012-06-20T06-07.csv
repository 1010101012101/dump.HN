4135920,comment,4135690,4135690,1,0,spaghetti,,,"I enjoyed this article. The emphasis on firing someone and still being friends or peers is a nice separation between business and relating to other people.<p>I'm curious about employer/business owner and worker relationships going forward. There's major downsides to full-time employees: it's difficult to hire someone that's skilled and gets along with others and firing a full-time employee is not a pleasant experience for anyone. There's also additional overhead associated with benefits and hr departments.<p>The modern tech ecosystem has eliminated much of my need to hire other full-time employees. Github takes care of version control. Mixpanel takes care of analytics. Even Airbnb simplifies traveling to the extent that I don't need any help. I can just pay contractors and freelancers for the work where I do require help.<p>The point is that full-time employees are looking less and less attractive to someone like me who's starting a new company. The path of least resistance is to just adjust my business structure or model to minimize the number of full-time employees I might need in the future.<p>There are certainly upsides to having full-time employees. And many companies require them. I think the extent to which I'm avoiding full-time employees long-term is interesting. I doubt I'm the only person considering this. So I'm curious how the employer/business owner and worker relationships will change in the next decade or so.",1340175347

4135912,comment,4134426,4135807,18,0,angersock,,,"Sure, here's my attempt at explanation:<p>OpenGL is a gigantic mess, one which only somewhat recently has started to get better. For those that don't know, it's lineage goes back to IrisGL and big-iron Silicon Graphics machines. There's a wonderful recap of its history on Stack Overflow ( <a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/60544/why-do-game-developers-prefer-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/60544/why-do-...</a> )--long story short, design-by-committee and squabbling vendors (especially the CAD folks, whom I until recently counted myself among) resulted in bloated, sad, crufty APIs.<p>Having to maintain a codebase to mimic old OpenGL functionality, especially when in some cases it wasn't particularly well-defined/standardized, in addition to coming up with a small profile for new features on embedded systems, would present a nontrivial burden on the driver and hardware writers. Hell, even Intel has only somewhat gotten it right recently--and they've had the OS community via Mesa do most of the work for them (as I understand it)!<p>These aren't features that are hugely important, these aren't features that are game changing, these are a lot of things that simply obsolete or unnecessary. jwz laments the lack of quads support, so let's start there:<p>OpenGL 1.x supported the following primitive types: points, lines, line strips, line loops, triangles, triangles strips, triangle fans, quads. quad strips, polygons (see <a href=""http://www.opentk.com/doc/chapter/2/opengl/geometry/primitives"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opentk.com/doc/chapter/2/opengl/geometry/primitiv...</a> for examples). Several of these options are quite redundant, and supporting them is not really helpful. Moreover, several of them present interesting questions for a driver writer: what is the preferred way of decomposing quads or polygons? Strips? Fans? Discrete triangles again?<p>Sphere mapping has, I believe, been replaced with cube mapping. OpenGL ES 1.1 has cube mapping as an extension, but I don't know if Apple decided to implement it or not--such is part of the evil of OpenGL, this use of extensions.<p>1D texturing (and 3D texturing) were omitted, again presumably to make implementors' lives easier. To face this, fill a whole 2D texture with a gradient, and clamp on the edges when sampling (glTexEnvi I think should do this...?). Hopefully that would work. Only recently have 1D and 3D textures gotten really useful, for clever tricks in passing LUTs and such to the programmable shader pipeline; I think the older use for them was ghetto cel-shading and palette mapping--cool but not critical.<p>~<p>Anyways, the problem with requiring that the library writers support all that is again that they would have to create most of the OpenGL environment (which is terrible), and then map it onto their new environment (even more terrible), as well as develop the new environment. This is nuts.<p>It's similar to asking if people could write a portability layer atop Win32 to support Win16 to support old DOS system calls--anyone can do a subset of that and complain that ""Hey, it's easy!"" but to do it right (and you <i>must</i> do it right, or else somebody else will complain!) is very nontrivial.<p>For a more timely example, consider the issues folks have had getting people to move on to Python 3--and contrast that with what the Rubyists have accomplished by just moving fast and fixing things as they break.<p>Or think about the amount of time/money spent on keeping the COBOL infrastructure up, or supporting legacy VB6 installations.<p>Honestly, sometimes we should applaud vendors for Doing the Right Thing and trying to force users into fixing outdated code.",1340175139

4135893,comment,4135690,4135690,26,0,physcab,,,"This article is half as good as it could be.  The underlying assumption here is that you already know an employee is bad and that you need to fire them.  But how do you know an employee is bad?<p>This is a question that no one seems to get right, unless its fairly obvious.  If they stole something, no brainer.  If they sexually harassed an employee, <i>should</i> be a no brainer. And if the company is in a financially distressed position, it may be unpleasant to fire someone, but atleast its understandable.  What if the company is healthy and employee did nothing obviously wrong?<p>Then I guess, you look at the quality of their work.  But judging quality is subjective, and you're likely to have a sliding scale depending on employee's past experience and delta to their start date.  And what about periodic reviews?  What about quarterly objectives?  What about what <i>other</i> employee's think?  How long do you warn an employee before you go ahead with it?<p>I think one of the better ways of dealing with firing is how it was handled in grad school.  At my school, you had a series of qualifying examinations and you had a committee.  The rules were pretty clear: 2 chances to pass and if not, goodbye.  One of the tests was an oral examination in front of the committee of 5.  There weren't any clear answers, but the committee would convene and in an hour they'd have a decision with lots of feedback.  I failed my first attempt.  But guess what? After that, I honed in on their feedback, worked my fucking ass off and passed my second attempt with flying colors.<p>I don't see this happening at many (or any) companies. I'm not sure why, but IMHO employers use the ""at will termination"" too liberally.  Either that, or they let the bad employees stay far too long.  Sometimes I wonder if a second chance would help bubble good employees to the top when you had previously mis-classified them as bad or vice versa.  Firing scares the shit out of people...why not make this process less of a surprise than it has to be.",1340174698

How so?<p>I guess you must mean that it would disturb the other four people in the office if one of them got up every few minutes. But it seems as though that is down to office design, not how often one person happens to stand up. I worked in a 100-person office for about a year and a half. The floor had nice-sized desk cubicles. The whole time, I strictly maintained a schedule, getting up exactly every half hour to go on a two-minute walk. It never disturbed anybody as far as I know; I didn't make any noise, I made sre my chair wasn't squeaky, and I walked carefully without stomping.<p>I really feel as though, if you're in a situation where on person getting up disturbs the workflow of multiple other people, then you have an office design problem. It wouldn't even matter if people got up fifteen times a day or three - if they're disturbing others unnecessarily, then you need your office fixed to remove this disturbance.<p>In particular, please note that the approach of blaming the disturbances on the people getting up seems like a path to terrible management.

Essentially I was well paid, but realized that my career was either going to go into management, or had reached a plateau.  Basically, much of the challenge of programming had been lost and every project started looking the same.<p>I decided to do a Masters, but in Bioinformatics rather than CS.  Bioinformatics is basically the application of computing to biological data sets, and in my case whole genome sequences.<p>I won't end up a bioinformatician as the money is no good, but the background the course has provided in statistics looks like it will be very important in my career development.<p>The most important thing about any Masters is the quality of research projects.  You will learn much more in conducting your own research than through coursework, and it will put you in contact with really smart, interesting people.<p>The good:<p>- More free time to work on side projects / start a consulting, contracting business<p>- If your research is interesting, it will open up doors (my research is in cancer at a world class cancer hospital, which seems to give my resume much more credibility)<p>- It gives you perspective on life, a chance to question what you really want out of it<p>- A different class of job opportunity becomes available, although this seems to be related to your research (e.g. if your research project was in driverless cars, I would expect that just about any tech company would at least interview you just so they can chat about it!)<p>- You'll experiment with new technologies.  Before starting my studies I was very much focussed on the Microsoft stack, but most of my research has now been on the nix stack which means I now have a much more diverse skill set.<p>The bad:<p>- Much less money.  Even with contracting, there will be times when cash is tight and expenses crop up (like needing to fix your car!)<p>- Pressure to jump into a phd.  Worse of all, you'll probably end up wanting to do a phd, which is cool if you are young, but as you approach 30 the thought of tying up another 4 years studying without making much money is scary.<p>- Exams, they don't suck any less now your older<p>Basically I think that going back to study has been one of my best decisions.  Its completely changed my career path for the better and given me a new sense of excitement for my work.<p>[Edit: formatting]",1340173560

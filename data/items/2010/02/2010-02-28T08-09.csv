I am looking to create a team of three to live and work together in preparation for the next round of YC. Launching prior to YC or applying to other similar programs are also options but, think the benefits of YC are worth the extra work.<p>Details:
After researching the pros and cons of hiring, Angel investing, and finding cofounders have decided the last option is best. I will be looking for two cofounders over the next couple of months to begin work on a minimum viable product. This product will be used in our application to the next round of Y-Combinator. During this time I am offering to pay all standard expenses (rent, food, internet, development costs) as this is the most common objection to starting in my experience. I currently live in San Diego walking distance from UCSD. I would be willing to relocate to the Bay area to build the right team. I have a couple of ideas (and prototypes) for the project I will present but, I would also like to hear your ideas and decide as a team which is the best opportunity. Understand some time will need to be given to getting to know each other and expect to try working a couple small projects ahead of time. Suggestions are welcome... please contact me at omni158 (gmail)<p>end",1267346877

With hardware support for virtualization, techniques like debugger detection just don't work.  The attacker can make his computer behave however he wants, at a level far beyond your control.)<p>It's probably best to just ignore piracy, because your game is going to be pirated no matter how advanced you think your protection is.  Remember, people take their xboxes into expensive microprocessor fabs and use electron microscopes to figure out how to bypass the piracy detection.  And, there is only one of you, but millions of people with plenty of time to spare that want to break your copy protection just to spite you.  You are going to lose, so why even waste your time?  The only people hurt by piracy protection are you and your users -- and that's a pretty silly demographic to try and hurt.<p>If your game is good, plenty of people will pay for it.

1156642,comment,1156454,1156454,0,0,Kadin,,,"I agree with the article's overall thesis, but the example used -- Hartford, CT -- wasn't convincing.  Having lived in Hartford and knowing quite a bit about the history there, I think the proliferation of parking was just another symptom rather than the cause of the urban decline.<p>The downtown core had already fallen into decline when the Interstate got punched through and when most of those parking lots got created; the Interstate (I-84) was a very conscious form of ""urban renewal.""<p>The elephant in the room is the phenomenon usually called ""white flight"" -- there was a sort of positive feedback loop created by the introduction of the automobile after WWII, where people who could afford cars discovered that they could live outside the cities where there was more room, and as they did so the urban core areas become less desirable places for people with means to live.  This fed on itself, until the urban core areas became economic and racial ghettos, and the surburbanites started demanding big freeways so they could get in and out to work more easily.  Those freeways were constructed by bulldozing the ghettos, sometimes with ill-concealed racism.<p>That pattern was a big part of what occurred in Hartford, which until very recently was a place that people from the surrounding areas <i>just didn't go</i> except to work, buy drugs, or catch the occasional Whalers game (and not enough of the latter).  That is starting to change, or so I've heard, but slowly.<p>But it's not like the parking lots <i>caused</i> the decline; the parking lots were only created after things had already started to go downhill.  They represented a sort of coup de grace to cities, since they oftentimes involved bulldozing beautiful buildings the likes of which will probably never be rebuilt, but they were a predictable effect after the people with money and influence departed for the suburbs.",1267345402

1156633,comment,1155986,1156211,0,0,westbywest,,,"As does my post, although I'm disappointed in the distribution of karma points on both.<p>Since child porn predates both wifi and the web, wifi encryption is just a band-aid when it's advocated as a solution to distribution of illegal content.  People determined to use the broadband connections of others to mask their usage need only google things like 'break wpa encryption' and find adequate means, and they have plenty of incentive to be determined.   Which still leaves the unfortunate middle-man with the same scenario of having his computer confiscated, but only now with even less of an idea of how to avoid the same problem in the future.<p>Besides that, my bias is instilled from seeing coffeeshops and similar small businesses inevitably annoy paying customers because of snafus with wifi ecryption, e.g. an older mac laptop that doesn't understand WPA2.  My opinion is that this does greater damage than the boogie-men of unsecured wifi will ever do.<p>To again invoke the analogy of car theft, where I live it's considered more sensible to leave your vehicle unlocked and nothing valuable in plain sight than to tint the windows.",1267345109

I've gotten 20% lifts out of ""stupid little things"" like that before, and seen good writeups of the same from other people.  But e.g. designers do not want to hear that the thing they spend 98% of their time on is essentially meaningless and the elements of the page which they scrutinize least carefully -- like microcopy or button text or (in one memorable test) which way the stock photo model is facing dominate the measurable results.  This is like how doctors do not want to hear that the difference in clinical outcomes due to professional experience is totally dwarfed by the difference in clinical outcomes due to following checklists.  (On the plus side, designers don't kill anybody for their professional pride.)<p>In general, I think the point of A/B testing is that you should ruthlessly soulcrush what you want with what the data actually tells you.  I respect HN folks enormously, but I'm not hearing ""I tested it and it worked"" -- I'm hearing ""I've got a great theory on why your data does not conform to reality.  Reality is, of course, what I predict it to be.""",1267344465

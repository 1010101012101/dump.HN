8594090,comment,8591486,8591486,0,0,softdev12,,,"Having just finished the book Hatching Twitter by Nick Bilton, it seems that the board is the crucial thing for founder control. This really surprised me because I had assumed that the board worked for the shareholders and that if you had the majority of the shares, technically you controlled the board via proxy. But there must be some sort of legal maneuver that prevents this (otherwise, a majority shareholder could call a special board meeting and replace the board or expand it in their favor).<p>It was puzzling to me how Ev Williams basically got kicked out of Twitter by the board (of which he was a member) when he was the largest shareholder. Perhaps his percentage was diluted down during the previous rounds? The book implied the board kicked Williams out against his own volition even though he seemed to hand pick all the board members.<p>If a case like Twitter (and now Tinder) where the board sets the ultimate agenda is the norm, choosing board members is something that should be given more emphasis and the info in the post seems to be exceedingly helpful.",1415768309

I know a lot of people who don&#x27;t like to work on projects or open source them because they&#x27;re afraid of being judged and a feeling that everyone is watching you (this is an emotion I had tackled for a while).

It&#x27;s also the easiest business decision to make. I hire some engineers + buy some computers and I can mint some money for a time. This is also a race to the bottom -- where there will be <i>some</i> easy money to be made at equilibrium, but it&#x27;ll be unsustainable for HFT firms at the margin. I would say manual trading has 0 impact here -- and they&#x27;ll likely get crushed.<p>Unique - These are strategies that only a small set of firms know. Eventually these strategies become well-known as people move around companies. There must be some secret strategies, though. Otherwise, why would Rentech & Citadel sue their own employees (unless we are to believe Simons & Griffin are simply vindictive). I think manual trading could work here if there is a strategy that simply haven&#x27;t been discovered by the HFT & quant. It&#x27;s might be hard, but not impossible. These secrets aren&#x27;t anything you&#x27;ll find online or in some trading forum, though. Or perhaps they are, but no self-respecting quant would go there (lest they become laughing stocks in their fund).<p>Non-Automatable:<p>Well-Known - PE is an example of one. In terms of liquid assets, maybe penny stocks are another area. If a group of &quot;manual&quot; traders couldn&#x27;t get permission to delve there... it&#x27;s probably even harder for a quant fund. It&#x27;s also the territory of insider info and rumors.<p>Unique - Maybe being there for the liquidity crashes I stated earlier is a good example. But there are certainly non-automatable unique strats around.<p>Depending on how much gold you believe is in the veins, all strategies are heading towards automatable & well-known. However, in the interim, I can see manual traders still making money (even with a sharpe > 1). In fact, I would say there are well-known strats you can execute manually (in say, your PA, that return sharpe ~0.8ish).",1415768037

8594077,comment,8593107,8594035,0,0,AndrewKemendo,,,"I should clarify point 2 then. I don&#x27;t mean that for founders it is a finance game, I mean that the idea of a community of high-growth, venture backed &quot;Startups&quot; which Y-Combinator and the various VCs sit at the seat of - is 100% finance driven. In other words, their goal is returns, not &quot;changing the world&quot; or doing anything different than the nihilists [1] on Wall Street. Investors like a company blowing them off to get traction because it is basically no risk for the investor, and helps them track their progress so they can come in later for a massive round.<p>I point this out because there is such a strong ethos around SV as being this kind of &quot;Anti Wall-street&quot; which I think is reinforced because founders/employees genuinely to want to make impactful stuff. The founders here and elsewhere in the startup world constantly talk about &quot;making a difference,&quot; &quot;changing the world&quot; etc. So whereas the junior analysts and salesmen on Wall Street all know and acknowledge that making shitloads of money is the primary goal, I have a hunch that the VC&#x27;s and LPs in SV (and elsewhere in the startup world) are using the naivety of high producing young, enthusiastic people to make a killing. This is why the archetype of the SV founder is someone who is personally low risk (single, young), is expected to work an insane amount to get growth going, tapping into growing markets and has already validated the market.<p>That is not to say that founders & finance are de-facto in conflict across the board, and it is also not to say there is some kind of conspiracy between Ron and Jim to juice labor, but I do think that founders are largely seen as a commodity to the finance class in the startup world. My guess is that they VCs are threading the needle really carefully with giving out information about how to get more &quot;founder friendly&quot; terms because founders are too smart to get screwed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://exiledonline.com/confessions-of-a-wall-st-nihilist-forget-about-goldman-sachs-our-entire-economy-is-built-on-fraud/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://exiledonline.com/confessions-of-a-wall-st-nihilist-fo...</a>",1415767974

At this year&#x27;s startup school, both Ron Conway and Jim Goetz (Sequoia) drove home the point that the #1 concern of entrepreneurs should be a maniacal focus on product, and it&#x27;s okay to blow off investors if necessary to achieve it (often, they even like it).<p>I think that your other points would follow if you assume that there are two primary ways for a venture capitalist to invest in a startup that&#x27;s achieved product/market fit:<p>1. Get in before they have product/market fit, spread your bets across many small startups, double-down on your winners, and replace the founders with professional management once the company has taken off.  This is much of the current seed investing climate, and the valuation worksheet you saw.<p>2. Wait until they have product/market fit, but differentiate yourself from other VCs by providing non-financial resources needed for a novice entrepreneur to become an effective CEO.

I just turned 22 and all of my friends are graduating college while I&#x27;m making bank because I jumped into the industry early rather than throwing my money at school.</i><p>The long-term impact of not having a degree, by and large, doesn&#x27;t appear to really show up until your 30&#x27;s or 40&#x27;s. It makes continuing in a technical role progressively harder (because it&#x27;s one area where you negatively stand out to the rest of the candidates passing by) and makes moving into management much harder because, <i>like it or not</i>, things like MBAs are still effective signaling tools for moving into management (and also teach you a lot, but on HN the idea of an MBA having useful lessons to teach is considered madness, so disregard that as you will). Getting there is much, much harder without a degree, and going back for that first degree is by all accounts <i>really</i> hard when you&#x27;re already in the real world.<p><i>> You know what&#x27;s better at making you a social network of industry peers than college? The actual industry.</i><p>The point isn&#x27;t to have a social network of industry peers. It&#x27;s to have a social network of people who are <i>not</i> industry peers.

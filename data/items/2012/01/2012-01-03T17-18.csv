3420561,comment,3420184,3420184,0,0,zfran,,,"I think OP is entirely missing the point of these frameworks. Zend Framework is probably the most enterprise-y PHP framework out there (vast amount of OOP patterns used, things copied from Java, heavy using of interfaces, etc) and if you don't like writing that kind of applications you shouldn't use it.<p>It seems to me that what he is trying to do is something like setting up a simple contact form using Java, Spring and Hibernate, and by this I don't mean that he codes silly stuff at all, but that if he feels this way he's just picking the wrong tools for the job.<p>I don't know anything about music but I also think that the analogy he used is wrong. Black Flag may do great music with much less equipment, but I doubt that with that drum kit the drummer would be able to do the same sounds or have the same precision as the drummer with the huge kit would.<p>Does OP know why Neil Peart needs all that stuff? I assume Neil wouldn't be able to play the same things in a minimalistic set up.<p>If you don't know what all the framework's ""boilerplate"" is for and you just want to get your application running, why are you using a framework in the first place? A framework is supposed to do stuff for you that you would have to otherwise do manually. If you don't normally do the stuff the framework does for you, don't use it.<p>There are plenty of quotes in there that I strongly disagree with (the commitment stuff mostly), but I think I can sum it up with saying that just because you can do great things with less it doesn't mean that having more is bad. Just learn to pick the right tool for the job.<p>edit: jrockway is spot on regarding code quality.",1325613579

If you really can afford on a project to go super clean and not need a bunch of other libraries, then maybe this is a really good time to be using something other than PHP.  I'm honestly not bagging on PHP here.  I really do think it has its place, and I was a PHP developer for many years myself.  But just as there's a place and a time for PHP, there is a place and a time for other languages, too.  When you have no dependencies on legacy PHP libraries, and the opportunity to go lean and clean and do what you want-- that's the project to not use PHP.",1325613519

3420549,comment,3420184,3420360,0,0,sequoia,,,"""I say that, beautiful or not, these two options are the best way to write unmaintainable code that doesn't ever work.""<p>I agree that for big jobs, you can't prioritize pretty over featureful, but, respectfully, I think you are overstating your point here: ""doesn't ever work.""  That's simply not true.  Have you really never written a working program without a full featured framework?<p>I think one of the points that isn't clearly enough articulated in this article, but is very significant for me, is code understandability.  Probably my biggest issue with CakePHP (what I use) is that when you step outside the standard use cases you fall down a rabbit hole of complexity and peculiar idioms.  The result here is that one becomes a ""Cake developer"" rather than a ""PHP developer""; there is a high degree of lock-in and switching the entire toolset becomes difficult and impractical.  So the idea being suggested is allow people to switch out tools one by one rather than start over with a new, incompatible set if they need some lower level change.<p>What I see in this post that I agree with is the idea that PHP tools should be more modular and decoupled, so you can grab a full stack bundle if you want, but can use modules piecemeal if you don't.  Currently, the latter option is lacking in PHP.  I don't think anyone's saying ""down with frameworks"" as much as ""hey, let's get some do-one-thing-well tools <i>as well</i>, so the piecemeal/modular option is also there.""",1325613453

That is the part that is hard.<p>I recently overheard a guy on the train talk about why he dropped CompSci as a major to his friend. He talked about the times where he would leave out a semicolon and the program would crash. And it would take hours for him to find the culprit. Leaving out the efficiency of his debugging, what I listened to more was the tone of his explanation. It was like a diatribe. His attitude was literally that any career where you have to worry about little things like semicolons was not the type of career for him. I suspect he had gone into the CompSci program because of the material benefits. And left once he discovered the devil is in the details. Programming is like weaving more than writing. I remember that he said he had switched majors to Business and loved it. Basically, he said CompSci was torture. Because he did not revel, like many of us do, in the sometimes long and backtracking path that we go through to write code.

Whether it is faster I do not know (obviously after years of using Colemak and rarely using QWERTY I type faster on Colemak, although I can still touch type on QWERTY -- something that most Dvorak typists seem to lose). The big difference is with comfort.

When a customer asks something, they're asking for one of these three relationships.<p>When we get upset customers aren't listening, it's often a disconnect of which relationship the customer wants, and what you are offering.  It's helpful to know which role you're being asked to play (and be paid for).<p>FREELANCER - Someone who you use from time to time to do a part of what you need.  Directions provided.  Generally freelancers work more part time than full time.<p>Typcially with freelancers you have to give notice on the order of 1-2 weeks.<p>CONTRACTOR - A regular expert who you provide detailed work instructions to.  Customer cares more about your opinion but the strategy is still set by them.<p>If I'm asked for a design that leads to work, it's a quote.  Typically the customer knows what they want, how they want it, or why, I'm just a hired gun.<p>Typically with freelancers you have to give notice for work from 0-7 days based on your arrangement.<p>CONSULTANT - A dedicated expert who is asked for their opinion of the best strategy to take, as well as delivering on it.  Consultants can be part time, but most are full time.  If all I'm being asked for is my professional opinion (and no ensuing work) I bill for that time.<p>Consultants are needed when you need expertise around at the drop of a hat to tend to things, or an ongoing basis to develop/manage/direct/drive internal business processes and hand them back in-house once management would like so you can focus on the next thing for them.<p>Customers who use consultants properly know it's not what it costs them, but what consultants save, or make them.  Sadly, this type of relationship can often be perverted by consultants as well and I inherit people who have been burnt.<p>Me: I spent my 20's getting 20 years of experience in 10.

While a good F@$* that S@#% helps everyone see the problem, the lack of action or offering of concrete ideas for improvement leaves me with the feeling that it's just complaining.<p>I wish more of the leadership in this community was contributing in an open-source, here's-the-code sort of way.

3420360,comment,3420184,3420184,0,0,jrockway,,,"Real-world applications are complicated.  There are three ways to handle this problem.<p>The first is to not handle the problem.  Implement something ""simple"" that doesn't work in uncommon cases.  This seems nice because there isn't much code and there isn't much complexity.  But that's because your program doesn't actually work, which is usually considered a bad thing.  (This program right here -> """" <- is the easiest way to solve problem X.  It only fails in 100% of the cases, that's all.)<p>The second way is to ""refuse complicated frameworks"" and write an application with a framework inside.  This is what most people do, but believe that they aren't using a framework because they didn't download one.  But, the same problems come up again and again: rendering data, handling AJAX requests, building database queries, managing users and passwords, the list goes on forever.  When you do a half-assed job of handling this stuff right in your application code, you're using a framework.  It's just a bad one.  You had to write it from scratch, it's not well-tested, and you can't reuse it.<p>A third option is to use well-written libraries (or frameworks) to manage the implementation complexity, leaving your application as a concise shell around the core components.  This means your application code only describes the problem that your application is trying to solve.  The dirty work of dealing with the real world (HTML, JSON, SQL, etc.), is all handled in other code.  (You can write this yourself, of course; you just have to understand that JSON parsing is not what your application <i>does</i>, and when you want to write that code, you need to ""switch gears"" and implement it outside of your application du jour.  And sometimes, ""you"" is not you, it's someone else on the Internet.)<p>This article suggests that you eschew option three in favor of option one or two, because the code is ""less beautiful"".  I say that, beautiful or not, these two options are the best way to write unmaintainable code that doesn't ever work.<p>The third strategy may feel unclean because you did not get to fully control every aspect of the interface and implementation.  But most of the time, that doesn't matter.  Yes, you'll have to do some configuration.  Configuration is easier to test and maintain than the logic that you're configuring, and that means your application is actually simpler.  The world is complicated.  Your software doesn't have to make it more complicated.",1325611091

People in all walks of life, in all times, have had to deal with not getting everything they want.  Had to deal with making <i>compromises</i>.<p>In this particular case Fred had several options to see the basketball game.  He has season tickets. He could have chosen a different way to pay for television (I don't live in NY but I'm assuming it has DirectTV or Dish Network or some other option besides just Time Warner). He made the choice that he made, but was unwilling to accept the downside it came with.<p>In the business world we call these entitled customers. These are the types of people who bring back clothes 2 years after the purchase and get huffy when the store won't return them.",1325610380

I offer 10, 20 and 35 hour blocks; 10 hour blocks are at my highest rate, but if the client buys more then the hourly price goes down.

That is why passwords are transmitted in plaintext then hashed and validated on the server side.  You should never trust the client to perform your cryptography for you, because you have no idea who--or what--the client is.  No amount of obfuscation can alleviate that fact.<p>1 <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3419700"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3419700</a>",1325610252

Due at least in part to the to the fact PHP is constantly trashed (rightly or wrongly) in the ""hip programmer"" community, there is a lot of defensiveness in the PHP community.  I understand why: one can only take so much trash talking especially when much of it is overblown or inaccurate, but it's caused many people to become so touchy that even valid, constructive criticism from community members is responded to with unnecessary vitriol.<p>I am glad Ed/Funkatron is forging ahead and voicing these concerns and suggestions nonetheless.  As a PHP dev, I look over the fence at python & ruby examples and wonder why my application/framework is so complex and ugly (obv. examples and production applications are apples and oranges, but the contrast is stark).  I hear ""PHP is supposed to be ugly.""  Seriously?  This is a selling point?<p>It's good to hear others call attention to these issues and suggest a path forward that keeps PHP competitive with other languages on the web.",1325610175

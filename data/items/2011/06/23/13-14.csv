2687854,comment,2683113,2683113,3,0,danssig,,,"Conditions are brilliant.  This is something I wish more languages would copy from CL.  Having said that, this [1] is a better treatment of conditions, what they can do and why you'd want them.<p>@Total_Meltdown Conditions are just that: <i>conditions</i>.  Not necessarily errors or exceptions.  Exceptions are a subset of conditions (""exceptional"" is a condition).  So if X is an error for your application you can unwind the stack if you want to.  Or you can try to fix the error in-place without trashing the rest of whatever the program was doing.  And yes, conditions allow one to establish protocols between lower and higher levels of code.<p>The insight of conditions is that the code that detects the error may know <i>ways</i> of dealing with it but only higher level code can know what should actually be done.  There are other ways of dealing with this (e.g. passing delegates) but all of them are much more clumsy than this system [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-co...</a><p>[2] Passing delegates was mentioned as a means of passing the condition handling code, but the issue is that the code may be 20 layers down the stack.  Is every called method going to pass this delegate?  Wont they have some failure conditions themselves?",1308837594

For example, I've been doing a bunch of PIC24 microcontroller programming recently, in both C and assembly. On these, an interrupt will store the return address on the stack, obliterating the variable. However, if more dead variables are on the stack, they may be left intact, since PIC24 uses shadow-registers to stash away the users register values temporarily so that the interrupt may reuse them. That is, they are not temporarily pushed onto the stack (obliterating more dead variables), but rather stashed in shadow registers.<p>Actually, interrupts store two 16bit values from the stack - a 24bit instruction pointer and the lower 8bit of the STATUS register, so would destroy 32 bits worth of dead variables' values.",1308836702

2687779,comment,2686580,2687459,39,0,yaakov34,,,"One last addition - I hope I'm not overstaying my welcome with all these little lectures on security. It used to be that a buffer overrun typically resulted from carelessness, like<p><pre><code>   char name[100]; //Who has a name longer than 100 characters?\n   printf(What is your name?);\n   scanf(name, %s);\n</code></pre>\nIt turns out that the same kind of people who have names like ""Robert'); DROP TABLE Students; --"" sometimes have 150-character names with a return address and a few bytes of malicious code. That's something that you handle kind of like you sanitize your inputs. You don't pour user input into a limited space. Scanf is deprecated now, and this kind of a vuln is becoming rare.<p>But as I explain a couple of comments down, a buffer overflow doesn't have to be this simple. You can get a bad pointer in a structure anywhere in your program, and when you use the structure, you will overwrite the stack. It's very hard to catch that kind of vuln - basically, it's a race with you (and white hats) vs. black hats. This is why I welcome the switch from C/C++ to managed code which is happening now, but very, very slowly.",1308836304

The problem is, that kind of extra detail isn't really possible without specializing -- and if you specialize, you limit the size of your audience.<p>The other problem is writing the stories: it would be awesome to have a writer for every kind of topic, so that every story can be tackled with complete background knowledge... but that's just not feasible. Instead, most tech blogs have writers with 'beats' that they cover -- but even then, if the 'green technologies' writer is out for the day, someone else has to tackle it.<p>So for the most part, we tech bloggers just try to get a good grasp of the technology, and then boil it down into a form that's easy to read and understand.

2687679,comment,2687390,2687617,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Emotion?  Of COURSE it's emotion!  It's ALL about emotion; the rest is just window dressing.  It's to grab you by the heart, the gut, or below the belt, always below the shoulders, never between the ears.<p>It's from a 'culture' that is ingrained and self-perpetuating:  In college, they majored not in math, physical science, or engineering but in the 'humanities', especially English literature.  There 'truth' is 'compelling' and from emotions or beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, personal, relative, etc.<p>In particular the most desired form of the emotions is 'drama' especially as in formula fiction with good and evil, etc.<p>The foundation is 'art' as in communication, intrepretation of human experience, emotions.  Or 'it feels good'.<p>This 'culture' is solidly in control of 'old media'.  There are two big reasons:<p>First, old media goes way back, is sitll close to the old morality plays, and goes way back before the revolution in information safety and efficacy starting with, say, J. Maxwell and with grand examples in math, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, technology, medical science, and medicine of the 20th century.  Old media is still locked up well before 1900, mostly 1800.  The college humanities majors naturally gravitated to that culture and still do.  There are more details in C. P. Snow's 'The Two Cultures'.<p>Second, ""The medium is the message"" has long held true.  In particular, before the Internet, the 'medium' was print, radio, or TV, and there the number of 'channels' and the 'bandwidth' of each channel were so small that the audience had to be very broad and the room for details was very small.  So, the 'message' was to low grade emotions and very short.  And that's what the article of this thread is.  Useful?  Rational?  No.  Emotional?  Trivial?  Yes.<p>So, obviously 'new media' can exploit more 'channels', would you believe over 100 million blogs, and more bandwidth, how ahout over 5 Mbps download bandwidth?  Then we can have 'streams of focused content for focused interests', over 100 million 'streams'.<p>Sure, anyone with anything like an education in math, science, or engineering good enough actually to make things work pays close attention to details, say, efficiency, cost, durability, power levels, etc.  Else, computers would snap, crackle, and pop, airplanes would never get off the ground, bridges and buildings would fall, etc.  But the English majors in the culture of old media don't care.<p>Old media is dying, and not just because Craig's List is taking their classified ads.<p>HN and your remarks are right on target for how old media is being killed and where new media will be better.<p>My view is that the biggest problem in civilization and our country now is the brain-dead, all-emotions all the time, dysfunctional, self-destructive nonsense of old media instead of the solid information we need to be responsible citizens and direct our government to a better future.  E.g., only now, slowly, are we learning the real anatomy of The Great Recession.  So, old media never got the word out.  Cry about the pains after the disaster?  Sure.  Have the solid, crucial information to avoid the disaster before hand?  NOT a chance.  Old media is helpless, full of tears, devoid of rationality or responsibility.<p>With old media, it's surprising we haven't blown up the planet by now.  Old media, I have a question:  ""Now, how does that make you feel?"".",1308834460

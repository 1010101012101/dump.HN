But most of them will not be able to bring themselves to accept substitutes such as sapphires, rubies, or emeralds. Because that would make their female friends think that the guy does not value them as much (or that they weren't able to find a guy who finds them worthy enough for a diamond).<p>This is, sadly, so very very true.<p>When I was proposing I wanted to get an alternative precious stone that would be actually rate - or, at least, a man-made diamond. I told my SO everything about how they're not rare, the price-fixing, the conflict diamonds - but she barely budged because of what her friends would think of it. I managed to sell the idea of a man-made diamond, but eventually had to settle for a natural one which wasn't sourced from Africa because of just how rare they are and how difficult it was to ship them to my country.",1363765767

If Google pledges 3 years support, then I will assume it's going to be killed in 3 years and not even bother trying to build a business on it, even though Google only means that as a minimum. If everybody assumes the same, then the API probably will end up dead in 3 years, because nobody is using it. On the other hand, since Google makes no such pledge, I don't feel like this API has an expiration date. Instead, I look at this as Google's latest product, and I might want to be the first to integrate it into my service, because it could be the next big thing. If enough people think that way, then the API will thrive and stick around. Sure, the API could still disappear, but any startup built on it has a greater chance of dying before the API does.<p>Google's problem right now is that it has pissed off a vocal minority with the Google Reader shutdown, so <i>any</i> announcement is being met with pessimism and mistrust.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy</a>",1363763101

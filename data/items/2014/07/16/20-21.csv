Even some fancier restaurants were found to have been just warming up pre-made dishes.  If a restaurant is not required to disclose this information, how would one ever find out?<p>Although, I do agree that a small bit of research will get you away from the touristy restaurants and into some more &quot;local&quot; places.

8044538,comment,8042387,8044167,2,0,x1798DE,,,"Well, what I mean is that we&#x27;d ideally have a situation where there are cheap dedicated hardware modules which contain your private key, so that you never have to trust your private key to a phone or a laptop. A phone can play that role and likely will at some point, but I&#x27;d still like something that is dumber than a phone, because I don&#x27;t want the device itself to be able to harbor malware. Plus, the idea of such an HSM would be that you carry it around and then you can plug it in (or wirelessly connect it) to any system you&#x27;re using, and all that system would be able to do is ask it to use its private key (which the system wouldn&#x27;t be able to see) to calculate the response to some authentication query. If you&#x27;re worried that your terminal might be compromised, you wouldn&#x27;t really want to connect it to your phone.<p>Also, Google Authenticator is similar to a really fancy password because it&#x27;s a symmetric key system. It&#x27;s nice because you only have to enter in one-time passwords on untrusted devices, but the downside is that both you <i>and</i> the service you&#x27;re authenticating with has the same key, meaning that if either you <i>or</i> the service you&#x27;re authenticating with is compromised, the attacker can authenticate as you. With SSL, the service being compromised doesn&#x27;t actually get the attacker anything except your public key.",1405544343

I&#x27;ll grant the case of Guantanamo prisoners as heinous violations of the rule of law, but I consider it a huge stretch to suggest that Assange would - if extradited to the US - face either treason charges (for reasons already discussed) or indefinite detention without due process. Whatever you may think of the US policies of indefinite detention, he doesn&#x27;t fit the profile for those who would qualify.<p>He would, no doubt, be given a lengthy federal trial, likely found guilty and serve Federal prison time, while receiving moral and legal aid from many corners, particularly organizations concerned with civil rights, whistleblowing, and journalism. His conviction might even be eventually overturned.<p>Indefinite detention works (in that it has not been stopped) because those who are imprisoned without due process have few mainstream defenders - plenty of people object to the methods, but are ho-hum on the actual people involved. Assange&#x27;s detention without due process would be a political  nightmare for the administration at very least.",1405544257

8044517,comment,8031840,8044115,1,0,aninhumer,,,">Violence is never profitable unless somebody else pays for it<p>Well yeah, your victims pay for it. My point is that there&#x27;s no inherent incentive for a private entity capable of violent coercion to use it for the benefit of anyone but itself. A truly democratic government has an incentive to use it to benefit at least a majority of people.<p>>I think this principle of majority is rather insane.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, but I think it&#x27;s the only way we can make fair decisions about how to share limited resources.<p>In theory Capitalism distributes the most to those who provide the most, which sounds great. In practice those with more resources are more able to provide utility in future, so the distribution ends up being very unequal.<p>(EDIT: One solution might be a free market + enforced wealth redistribution at a rate based on the level of inequality. I think this would actually be much better at encouraging people to actually produce new utility constantly, instead of rent-seeking.)<p>>A simple test: if tomorrow the majority decided to shoot all redheads, if you followed your principle, you&#x27;d have to agree.<p>And you think a society that would pass such a vote would be any kinder in a free market? If a majority of people actively want redheads to be killed, then your supposed protection agencies would be happy to oblige.<p>And even without violence, the majority needs only to deny them work and they would starve to death, or at best live in ghettos.<p>> When you say &quot;some freedoms should be guaranteed&quot; you probably mean &quot;some services&quot;, which is different.<p>No, my whole point is that access to services <i>is</i> a form of freedom. The freedom to eat. The freedom to learn. The freedom to be healed. If these things are contingent on labour, then they are lesser freedoms.<p>In a world with limited resources, some freedoms will always be curtailed. The question is which ones are the most important? I think the freedom to eat is more important than the freedom to decide how a portion of the utility you provide is shared.",1405544195

Ordinarily this license is as close to the public domain as you can be while still still having a license. So the protections against re-licensing are similar to protections for works placed in the public domain. For example you can&#x27;t relicense Bach&#x27;s works and then sue people for playing those works. So the burden is on the relicensor to show that their license supercedes the WTFPL. Unfortunately, the specifics of how this burden is handled in a court as well as treatment of the public domain in general are per-country (and sometimes subject to international agreements). Likewise with warranty, different countries will have different treatments.<p>What I don&#x27;t quite get is why at this point you wouldn&#x27;t simply place a work into the public domain or use creative commons or whatever.

You will have to pay an additional premium for OCaml developers due to the lack of experienced talent.<p>This assumes that &quot;not popular&quot; means &quot;low current supply&quot; but not also &quot;low current demand&quot;. If the benefits are underrecognized among firms, then the current supply of OCaml developers could well be underpriced compared to value.<p>> OCaml is a risk. If you&#x27;re starting a consumer-oriented service, you need to prove there is a market for it. Will OCaml help you get to market faster?<p>Faster than what?<p>> I don&#x27;t know. Will Ruby-on-Rails? Yes.<p>In the Ruby-on-Rails case, do you really know, are you just following accepted wisdom? What&#x27;s the comparison &quot;faster&quot; against in the first place?<p>> I&#x27;d pick RoR any day just to eliminate the risk of getting to market late.<p>If RoR really could <i>eliminate</i> that risk, and had no other costs for doing it, that would be a no brainer.

The idea was to model a radar or early engagement system or something like that.<p>The obvious way might be to build a whole nest of objects which communicate among one another to consider the formation of the geometry. Another method is to just use functions from points to booleans which model the eventual question &quot;is this point covered&quot;.<p><pre><code>    type Geometry = (Lat, Long) -> Bool\n\n    type Radius = Double\n    type Length = Double\n\n    circle :: Radius -> (Lat, Long) -> Geometry\n    circle rad (x0, y0) (x1, y1) = sqrt (dx*dx + dy*dy) where\n      dx = x0 - x1\n      dy = y0 - y1\n\n    square :: Length -> Length -> (Lat, Long) -> Geometry\n    square width height (top, left) (x, y) =\n         y < top\n      && y > top - height\n      && x > left\n      && x < left + width\n</code></pre>\nSo here we build our geometry straight out of lambdas. A Geometry is just a function from (Lat, Long) to Bool and we generate them through partial application. We can also combine them<p><pre><code>    union :: Geometry -> Geometry -> Geometry\n    union g1 g2 pt = g1 pt || g2 pt\n\n    intersect :: Geometry -> Geometry -> Geometry\n    intersect g1 g2 pt = g1 pt && g2 pt\n\n    minus :: Geometry -> Geometry -> Geometry\n    minus g1 g2 pt = g1 pt && not (g2 pt)\n</code></pre>\nand then using all of these &quot;combinators&quot; build a sophisticated geometry which describes the final question &quot;is a point covered by this geometry&quot;.<p>The ultimate modeling tool was just lambdas. They are used so pervasively here I&#x27;d have a hard time pointing out each and every application.<p>[0] The comparison itself is sort of stupid, but the paper is still neat <a href=""http://cpsc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/tr1049.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cpsc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/tr1049.pdf</a>",1405541509

The Closure tech lead responsible for open-sourcing it is a friend of mine.)<p>It&#x27;s true that all of Google&#x27;s major customer-facing apps use Closure.  However, I would not consider it to be a separate language, but rather a large component library and toolchain for developing JS apps at scale.  The language is identical to Javascript, and Closure apps can be run uncompiled, they just take up more bytes on the wire and give the programmer weaker error-checking.<p>It is also very possible to write Closure without the type declarations - I&#x27;ve done it, frequently, for various doodles & easter eggs.  They are non-optional according to the styleguide, but that&#x27;s a style choice mandated for large teams.  Typically, type annotations make working with large multi-developer JS apps <i>much</i> easier, but they&#x27;re unnecessary for smaller one-off projects.<p>Also, any JS developer off the street can download Closure and use it to write JS apps, since it&#x27;s open-source.  If they want to use Closure Compiler they will probably have to forgo certain language features; I once tried to get JQuery to compile with it and it was basically a total loss.  But the language should be completely familiar to anyone accustomed to working with Javascript.  (You probably don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to do this if you just have a small startup, since both the compiler and class library are designed for working with very large-scale apps and pay a large verbosity penalty for keeping things manageable, but it&#x27;s possible.)",1405541218

Most kids have to go to school because the actual and opportunity cost of homeschooling is usually too expensive or often neither parent is qualified to provide a better or even acceptable education. When homeschooling is workable, going to school is often still a better aspect exactly because having a huge amount of experience with both the good and the bad of social settings is incredibly valuable as an adult (and that most adults have such experience is one of the main reasons adult society does tend to be less nasty IMO - people get fed up with it).<p>If you can be honest and tell kids &quot;the real world isn&#x27;t like school&quot;, why can&#x27;t you be honest and tell them the real reasons they are nonetheless made to put up with it?",1405540913

8044175,comment,8043655,8043655,8,0,claudiusd,,,"> OCaml includes many features that are not available in the more mainstream programming languages ... and we believe this gives us a competitive advantage. ... The purpose of this post is to explain the benefits of OCaml and compare it to other languages. We hope to convince readers, especially other developers, to consider adopting OCaml for their projects as well.<p>The authors did a great job explaining the benefits of OCaml and why I as a developer should think about using the language. I actually want to play around with it now in a side project.<p>As a start-up manager though, I think the business case is strongly against them and don&#x27;t believe there is any &quot;competitive advantage&quot; from using OCaml... in fact, I think the opposite. Here&#x27;s why:<p>* There is not a strong community behind OCaml. You can&#x27;t take advantage of the numerous libraries and references created by the community like you can with Ruby, Python, Javascript, Java, or any of the other mainstream languages.\n* OCaml is hard (and so are most functional programming languages). You will always need exceptionally talented developers to work on your code base and that will get expensive.\n* OCaml is not popular. You will have to pay an additional premium for OCaml developers due to the lack of experienced talent.\n* OCaml is a risk. If you&#x27;re starting a consumer-oriented service, you need to prove there is a market for it. Will OCaml help you get to market faster? I don&#x27;t know. Will Ruby-on-Rails? Yes. I&#x27;d pick RoR any day just to eliminate the risk of getting to market late.",1405540848

I feel that almost nobody would disagree that these are advantages of OCaml.<p>Most people also suggest that strict evaluation and impurity are good traits of OCaml. This is more a contested point, however, as lazy evaluation and strict evaluation are more like duals than one being definitely better than the other. Furthermore, unrestricted side effects are a major tradeoff between convenience and safety—it&#x27;s up to your use case to decide what&#x27;s best.<p>Finally, OCaml obviously has an &quot;O&quot;bject system in it. My understanding is that serious OCamlers shy away from it for reasons of complexity and low value. The major stuff is provided by the module system and doesn&#x27;t have anything particularly &quot;object&quot; about it.",1405540808

1723211,comment,1721494,1722642,0,0,henrikschroder,,,"> That's not very connected. You could easily imagine a free form electronic system.<p>I can also imagine a multitude of ways electronic voting can fail or be manipulated without anyone knowing.<p>Voter turnout was over 84%, and that number has been increasing over the last few elections. We do not have an accessibility problem. For the type of elections we have, the current system is a good fit. One person - one envelope. When the polling stations close the polling clerks take all the envelopes, open them, sort the ballots into valid and invalid piles, and then count the valid votes by hand. It takes a few hours, but we get a pretty accurate preliminary result on election night, and the process is completely open, anyone can watch the counting.<p>After the preliminary counting all the ballots are sent in to the regional election authority office where they do a second counting where they also add in mail-in votes from Swedes abroad and other people who couldn't be there on the voting day. The second counting is also completely open, anyone can come and watch.<p>Yes, it takes a few days to get the final result, but the confidence in the result is very high. Yes, there are occasional screwups, but it gets noticed, it gets reported, anyone can notice them, you don't need to a software engineer to have a chance at it.",1285322216
1723210,comment,1722126,1722632,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"The second strangest part of this outage (to me) was that the cluster <i>""was quickly overwhelmed by hundreds of thousands of queries a second.""</i> Does Facebook not have a way to curtail the number of queries being sent to its databases? I'm not a highly experienced programmer or dba but i've seen mod_perl websites that can do this with their API layer. It was engineered in once it was realized the database cluster could only do so many queries and connections at a time and they didn't want to lock up the database servers.<p>The strangest thing to me was that the clients had the permission to essentially cause a race condition across  the whole site. From what I understand, the client ran an API call which either forced a re-fetch of a key which apparently only needed to be fetched once (and thus theoretically could have been staged in advance using a database application not running on the frontend site which could update the cache and prevent a database fetch, or just update the database, whichever was more necessary), or failing the database connection due to the aforementioned thundering herd of QPS it also triggered a re-fetch from the db (which again could have been prevented by a db app pre-loading the new value). So, if my outsider's idea of how Facebook's code works is accurate, this could have been prevented if either the cache/database was ""pre-fetched"" in the background not using client API calls, or if client API calls simply weren't allowed to all modify [and read] from a single key in the database. The latter point seems less likely than the former, but possible.<p>(Sorry if i'm speaking out of line or as an uneducated FB user, but according to these comments and RJ's breakdown this is how it appears to me)",1285322142

It depends on the type of app you're writing and who's going to use it and what platform its for.<p>Is it mainly for Windows users? Might want to go with .NET. There are free versions of Visual Studio available for this purpose.<p>Is it for Linux systems? GTK with C/Python or Qt with C++/Python maybe a better option. All the libraries and compilers are free. Mono (an open source .NET implementation) also works well on Linux.<p>If its for the Mac then Objective-C + Cocoa is the de facto method. The IDE, Xcode is a free download from Apple.\nYou can also get python bindings for Objective-C.<p>If it has to run on many platforms then you might want to think of a cross-platform toolkit.<p>If the program has a very simple UI, then you can probably get away with using wxWidgets or QT with Python.<p>If UI is more involved, then you will probably want to write the front-end for each in it's own native framework.",1285322097

If this was lesswrong or reddit, the post might have a negative score, it would certainly be controversial.<p>Personally attacking the author is okay because<p>(a) He's not remotely as active, committed or useful a commenter as Patrick.<p>(b) Obvious self-promotion is taboo among technical people and among their broader cultural peers, nerds, geeks, whatever. Demonstration of talent in the course of something else is the way to go. lsc has some great comments on this, and makes the point that business people are just not like this, at all. Sebastian is much, much more like them in this regard than Patrick.<p>But many people probably agree with him among the lurkers because not all of his comments on this thread are negative, they're hovering around 1 or 2.<p>Now personally I too think this was inappropriate, but if he had run it by Patrick, it'd have been fine.

Sure we can argue that a distributed network would be a much better solution but the reality of it currently is that very few people have the technical inclination to becomes a part of something like that.<p>I'd also prefer to look at the benefits and not the downfalls of massive networks being able to be ran by few people. Giving people a job for the sake of having a job isn't the answer, we can all benefit from increased efficiencies.",1285319390

I have nearly two decades of business experience, and I have never come across anyone who comes remotely close to approximating the grossly unprofessional manner in which Dave communicates.  How could professional colleagues and entrepreneurs put up with that?  His style is a reflection of substance -- substance which is unprofessional, irresponsible, and uncivil.  From the perspective of fellow investors, Dave's writing comes across as very sophomoric and utterly unprofessional.  From the perspective of entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs merit more than any money, contacts, and accumulated wisdom that an investor can offer -- they also deserve a responsible and professional role model.  Dave's writing is reflective of one whom I would hardly find to be a good role model.  It is just simply improper and disrespectful of others for anyone to communicate in the manner that Dave has, and it is highly irresponsible for an adult to project himself or herself in such a manner especially when serving in an advisory or mentoring capacity.<p>Thanks, Ron, for calling a spade a spade.  I watched an interview with Ron about a year ago, and I found him to be very forthright, insightful, sincere, and professional - and clearly one who wants to try to help entrepreneurs out as much as he can.  He seems to be a good role model for entrepreneurs.  Thanks too to Mike Arrington for breaking the story and to Mike and his team for their follow up reports.",1285319033

Imagine a simplified MRI machine in every GP&#x27;s office 40 years from now. Imagine the machine having a networked software layer integrated that doesn&#x27;t even allow the raw static-image data out to the doctors, but instead just reports out weighted-average feature-change velocity heatmaps.<p>Presumably, the only people getting an MRI done every year <i>now</i> are the ridiculously rich, who could buy an MRI machine of their own, and a hospital wing to put it in. But <i>the theory</i> behind getting one isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s just scarcity, and the effect scarcity has on the level of trust we put in the few samples we can beg, borrow or steal.",1430686787

It is pretty cool (and definitely more secure) to run OpenBSD but you can probably get most of the upside by slapping OpenWRT on the consumer router you already have. A $50 WDR3600 happily handles several VPNs, custom VLANs, an IPv6 tunnel, exotic routing, an external drive, and a Samba server while doing the typical SOHO router-y stuff, like wifi.<p>BTW Running my own name server has solved a lot of weird slowdowns I used to experience when browsing the web or sshing. According to namebench[1], my router doesn&#x27;t even crack the top three when it comes to response time so I used to have it forward queries but in practice, after it warms up, it&#x27;s more reliable and delivers a smoother experience than either my ISP or Google.<p>[1] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/namebench/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/namebench/</a>",1430686299

If you find that onerous because of the volume of breakin attempts, that&#x27;s a good sign you need something like fail2ban.<p>Fail2ban isn&#x27;t foolproof, incidentally. I once nearly caught a worm despite a limit of 6 login attempts per IP, because I had created an account with username and password both &quot;test&quot; that I had since forgotten about, well before I exposed that particular machine to the internet. Oops! An automated script managed to guess that in well under 6 attempts! Fortunately I was physically present at the time and noticed the abnormal load within a few minutes, and killed the offending process (doubtless a local password cracker for privilege escalation) before it could do any damage. Lesson learned there, and it also taught me the value of knowing your machine well enough to <i>sniff</i> when it&#x27;s not behaving right.

They entered the internet era with a product that was perfectly positioned to be annihilated by Napster, iTunes, and YouTube.<p>The pop single was a great product in its day. The recording industry invented pop singles and then spent fifty years perfecting the machine to market them.<p>To focus the marketing, singles were released a few at a time, and radio stations were encouraged [1] to play the same small playlists relentlessly, over and over, day and night. We all got used to the fact that there were only a few hundred songs on the radio and that they weren&#x27;t merely free, but inescapable.<p>To further focus the marketing, the audience was relentlessly diced into genres, and high walls were built between the genres. Sorry, no hip-hop here, this is a rock station; Sorry, no zydeco here, this is a country station. We all got used to the fact that each of our local radio stations had a sound that never changed, and that you could name the songs that would be playing in a bar before you walked in. (Hint: <i>Hotel California</i>.)<p>For a while there, bands would release carefully-crafted albums that were designed to be listened to in a sitting, but the radio would never play whole albums except on very special occasions. Also, long songs would generally be abridged or avoided. We all got used to the fact that music came in randomly-shuffled three-minute chunks, which just happen to be really quick to download and easy to stuff onto USB sticks.<p>Then Mephistopheles appeared, holding the first compact disc, and the industry&#x27;s doom was sealed as it realized that it could make an easy fortune by selling the baby boomers&#x27; music to them over again in a new format. And, indeed, that fortune was made. The industry&#x27;s focus shifted to the past, and parked there. They made a lot of money selling copies of <i>Rumours</i> and <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> to multiple generations of listeners, and they invested in branding juggernauts like Madonna and Michael Jackson that promised to sell albums for the next fifty years, and we all got used to the fact that one could pick up a copy of <i>Rolling Stone</i> and have difficulty figuring out which year it was from.<p>Plenty of people complained about this system at the time, but it did make money. Until Napster and Apple came along and said &quot;Hey, your entire musical universe fits inside a small box like this, would you like one?

9482923,comment,9478806,9479156,0,0,Mz,,,"I am 49. I will be 50 in June. I have a form of cystic fibrosis. The average life expectancy for CF is currently around 36 or 37. I was diagnosed just before I turned 36 and I spent a year at death&#x27;s door and had a real scary incident where I realized, at age 35.5, that if the drugs -- that were NOT working -- did not start working real soon, I could be dead within 24 hours.<p>That was over 14 years ago and I have spent a whole lot of years reading up on health topics and working to improve my health. I suspect I know a good bit more about the topic of what foods can do to a body and how to use them to get specific effects than you currently know or will ever know.<p>When I was a lot sicker, I did my best to avoid yeast-leavened bread and to limit yeast-leavened foods. I went so far as to come up with a pizza dough recipe that had no yeast in it. As I got healthier, I began tolerating bread better. I have a long history of tolerating wheat poorly and I still have to limit wheat. People with CF are at greater than average risk for Celiac (gluten and wheat intolerance) than the general population and it is common for people with CF to tolerate wheat and dairy poorly. I generally tolerate food better than I used to. I used to really struggle to eat and had a whole lot of food intolerances.<p>I have spent a whole lot of time in alternative med circles talking with people who have tried chelation and gotten super picky about the foods they eat and so on. Some of those folks have PhDs and some of them have been really helpful in explaining some things to me related to my own research into alternative therapies for my own condition.<p>One of the problems with your hypothesis here is that &quot;bread&quot; is not a monolith. There are a great many things that qualify as bread and they can contain quite a lot of different ingredients. I assume you mean yeast-leavened wheat breads. Yeast can be a problem for a number of reasons for people with certain issues and some folks don&#x27;t tolerate wheat well. But you also find yeast and wheat in other things, so just eliminating &quot;bread&quot; doesn&#x27;t fully solve that problem if one of those specific ingredients is the culprit.<p>Furthermore, my experience has been that, for example, how a crop is raised and processed can have such significant impact on the chemical make-up of a particular food such that I need to be a lot more specific even than “x food” in order to come up with meaningful restrictions. For example, I have to be careful with meats and there is a big difference between, say, kosher meat and non-kosher meat or organic, grass-fed meat and &quot;commercially&quot; grown (for lack of a better alternative term).<p>There are a huge number of things that impact brain health. I am getting my brain function back after having it significantly impaired by years of being very ill and years of taking a metric fuck ton of prescription drugs in order to avoid dying. Some things that have gone into repairing my brain function include B vitamins, the right fats, good quality salts and the right carbs.<p>If removing yeast-leavened wheat bread from your diet is doing you significant good with regards to your brain function, I will suggest that a likely explanation is a) you have an infection and the yeast feeds on the infection and creates alcohol within your system that impairs your brain function and/or b) you have what gets called &quot;leaky gut syndrome&quot; in some alternative med circles. The belief there is that leaky gut allows molecules to be directly absorbed into the blood stream and that causes proteins to cross the brain blood barrier and cause mental impairment. I don&#x27;t know how accurate that mental model is. I don&#x27;t specifically ascribe to it as far as my own health issues go.<p>However, I do know that the gut is about 70% of your immune system, so if there is anything wrong with your gut, you can bet money there is a shit-load of other problems happening because of it.<p>Removing stressors from your diet may take some of the load off a frail gut, but it won&#x27;t repair it. Some things that may help include organic yogurt, good quality sea salt, the right carbs and the right fats (coconut oil and organic butter are two that work well for me).<p>I will reiterate that I really wish people like you would not jump in here with completely nonsensical assertions that they can&#x27;t explain better than &quot;I removed bread from my diet and I THINK it is helping, though I can&#x27;t provide you any real metrics for how it is improving.&quot; I can provide real metrics for how much my health has improved and it has been nightmarish to try to get people to engage me in a meaningful manner and not dismiss me as just some quack. So folks like you just really get on my nerves.<p>Best of luck with your quest to slow your brain deterioration.",1430685603

This produces the same &quot;canonical ordering&quot; and hence the same &quot;canonical Gram matrix&quot; for any set of vectors that have the same collection of pair-wise relationships, as measured by dot-products.<p>For graphs with binary adjacency matrices this can be stated more simply as sorting the vertices such that the resulting adjacency matrix, when read l-to-r and t-to-b, produces the largest binary number.

If you understand the concepts behind MVC really the only challenge is mapping functionality between the frameworks. While initially it may be confusing to figure out that mapping as each framework does not have the same function names or implement a concept the same way, once you get the general idea of using the new framework it will seem much easier. My recommendation is to find and work through a couple sample applications in CakePHP.

American Creationists are believers who reject what science has figured out in favor of <i>biblical literalism</i>. They even built the <i>Creationist Museum</i>, whose exhibits depict &quot;<i>the coexistence of humans and non-avian dinosaurs, say that the Earth is approximately 6,000 years old, and dispute the idea that life evolved into its current forms.</i>&quot; – <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Museum"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Museum</a>",1430683286

Also, this is an article about evolutionary biology, not creationism. The part you object to is easily overlooked. I&#x27;m sure this issue is very important to you, but I believe the best move here is to simply turn the other cheek.",1430683244

If you self published = you get it all, less the 30% to Apple. If you have a publisher he will not use iBooks because their profit will be larger than his or yours.<p>Attracting the eyeballs to consider buying your book.
That is what AMazon and iBooks does well, as do publishers. Eyeballs cosr $$ per click, 5 cents and upwards.
Publishers usually give away a number of paper books to hope for good reviews. What does Amazon or iBooks do?<p>See if you can find some self publishing sites, with near zero fees and see how popular they are.",1430683219

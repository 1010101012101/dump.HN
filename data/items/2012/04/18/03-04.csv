Unfortunately as humans we don't react well to being attacked by animals.<p>Assuming you can't use your head to avoid being attacked, you need to remember to be merciless and beast-like in your counter attack.  Otherwise, if you handicap your reaction you could end up severely injured or dead.<p>It's not that hard to kill a swan or to blind a larger animal.  The problem is realizing you need to.<p>My Experience:\nMy dog was violently attacked by another dog when she was a pup.  I stupidly jumped on the other dog and immediately went to work on prying the dog's mouth open.  That didn't do much, it was a 50lb pit bull.  Had I gouged its eyes out I would have gotten my pup loose a lot sooner (the attacking dog had to be put down anyway).<p>I learned my lesson after that.  A few years later my dog was attached by a shepard mix (we're just lucky I guess).  That time I reacted without mercy and kicked the other dog in the ribs as hard as I could which made it let go instantly.  Then it lunged at me and I punched it in the face, again, as hard as I could.  It hobbled away stunned.<p>It sounds terrible, I know, but compared to the first attack where my dog had several puncture wounds and my hands got pretty cut up, I didn't have a scratch on me and my dog was in pretty good shape too.  Obviously, never do these terrible things to another animal unless you're defending yourself.",1334721323

However, SPDY seems to be optimized for the longer, higher latency, and slower connection between user and server rather than the faster internal connection between load balancers and servers. Finally, all SPDY communication is encrypted via TLS, so that process might add to a slowdown between internal systems.<p>Guess we'll need to benchmark it and see!

In that case, I would submit that being given the correct answer to a calculation helps the student FAR more than being forced to estimate it.<p>Suppose you are studying math, and come upon a question to which you don't know the answer.  Which better helps you to understand, starting from ""I need to figure out how to do this"" or ""I need to figure out why the answer is 0.0001.""?<p>Further, this has little to no application in the real world classroom.  For tests in which calculators would simply give the student the answer, students are simply not allowed to use calculators at all.  I would argue that, in an exam environment, there is effectively no margin between ""a normal calculator would be cheating so you have to use paper"" and ""this has multiple steps such that a simple calculator will not give you the right answer without understanding.""

It's just that HNizens live in a much more interesting ecosystem than the average corporate Java programmer who has to wear a tie to the office.<p>Also, Sun did spend ridiculous amounts of money on Java - mostly to level the field against Windows, as Java makes apps easily move from Windows to Unix and vice versa - and made easier to sell SPARC servers that don't run Windows but can run Java applications that also run on Windows. And do so with performance and stability no Windows box could touch. And most can't, even today.<p>Remember: Sun was a hardware company. A confused one, perhaps, but hardware was their core.<p>Oracle, OTOH, invested (or burned) money fully knowing what to expect in return.

They may not have realized the scale, or the details of it though. I think those of us who's parents acted on that are really blessed with the jumpart we got on the world to come",1334718547

Presumably I'm getting it at a discount for being an investor.  Does it adequately compensate me for the risk of buying a nonexistent product?  Shouldn't I get some percentage of its profits, if it's not going to be free software after an injection of more than $200K?  Does the license give me lifetime upgrades, or only the first version?<p>These were my thoughts as I clicked through the Amazon payment buttons.",1334718420

However, if you use a mail client and generate app-specific passwords that last forever, can't the hackers just hack via IMAP login instead which won't be 2-factor?<p>It seems like it would be better to use private keys on the client with 2 factor auth for authentication recovery. That way as long as you have the right private key locally that your mail client uses, you are set- otherwise you have to both provide a password and an SMS delivered code in order to use a different private key on the client.",1334718417

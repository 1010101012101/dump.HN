In fact it's easier in Perl than in Erlang, a putatively-functional language!<p><pre><code>    map { $_ * 2 } (1, 2, 3)                   - Perl\n    lists:map(fun (X) -> X * 2 end, [1, 2, 3]) - Erlang\n    map (*2) [1, 2, 3]                         - Haskell\n</code></pre>\nThe last one for comparison. Erlang can do better with a list comprehension, though:<p><pre><code>    [X * 2 | X <- [1, 2, 3]]\n</code></pre>\nwhich except for case also works for Haskell. But that exclusively works with only map and filter (in Erlang [1]), Erlang is still surprisingly klunkier than Perl for everything else (folds, actually passing functions around, etc).<p>[1]: Haskell recently re-added monad comprehensions, so comprehensions aren't as limited anymore. <a href=""http://blog.n-sch.de/2010/11/27/fun-with-monad-comprehensions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.n-sch.de/2010/11/27/fun-with-monad-comprehension...</a>",1312934233

Once a restaurant has committed to a particular POS, it is very, very, very hard to get them away from it.<p>First, it cost them -- at a safe ballpark estimate -- $10,000 to install it in the first place, so they're going to milk it for as long as they can before paying for anything else, even if it costs them more money that way in the long run.<p>Second, change is really scary for these folks, because if they're trying a new POS, and it crashes on its first evening, they're going to have a lot of pissed off customers and that translates directly to empty seats. It doesn't help that every single system that they've tried -- or that their buddies in the industry have tried -- have been buggy, problematic, and prone to crankiness.\nIt doesn't matter if you know that you're selling the best system in the world at the cheapest price; the owners are still going to be really gun-shy about converting.<p>For a credible, sexy Open Table competitor: check out <a href=""http://averoinc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://averoinc.com</a><p>Note: Some comments taken out of context from the threads linked below.

But theyre not boring; theyre hugely popular. Java middleware firm eXo then asked the question: What if we redesigned our enterprise intranet as an internal social network? Not only for Chatter-style updates/activity streams, but more as a place where employees throughout the enterprise could interact and engage with each other, where they could share content and ideas, and collaborate on projects. Would it be more popular and useful than the existing intranet that, like so many enterprise intranets, few people actually use?<p>The short answer is yes, and a more detailed and engaging account of the companys experience can be found in The Unexpected Benefits of the Social Enterprise, a free white paper available at http://budurl.com/ygvh.<p>Unprecedented Employee Participation<p>eXo executives had a straightforward if ambitious goal: create an intranet that employees around the world would want to use. It would not be the dumping ground for meeting notes, HR memos, and other static content, but rather the crucible of employee interaction and ideas. It would be a customizable, extensible intranet, one that employees could personalize easily using dashboards, gadgets, activity streams, and more. It would be a place where they could create and share content with co-workers, with content management technology behind it all to maintain order and ensure easy discovery.<p>Using its own eXo Platform 3, eXo built out this new intranet and made it available to employees on January 1, 2011. Use of this intranet, and participation in the social spaces it provided, was completely voluntaryyet within 15 days virtually every eXo employee was actively engaging with it. eXo employees work from sites in the United States, France, Ukraine, Tunisia and Vietnam, yet they all meet and stay connected on the new eXo social intranet. They discuss and engage around projects, customer needs, bug reports, travel plans, even sporting events. Theres a sense of unity that did not exist before, a sense of common experiences shared across four separate continents.<p>A Replicable Model<p>In The Unexpected Benefits of the Social Enterprise, eXo provides useful insights into the design and construction of its new social intranet. Key sections of the white paper include:<p>	Dashboards: Central to the Modern Enterprise Intranet\n	Building and Organizing the Social Intranet\n	Using the Social Intranet\n	Impact and Unexpected Benefits of the Social Intranet<p>What becomes clear in this free white paper is that going social holds the potential for huge benefits for enterprises of all sizes. The tools exist today to create such an intranet, and the model can be replicated and expanded on the fly to meet the needs of virtually any organization.<p>Download The Unexpected Benefits of the Social Enterprise at http://budurl.com/ygvh to learn more about the success that eXo has achieved with this new approach.<p>For more information on eXo, please visit http://exoplatform.com.

If you create one site that works great on everything, you make less money.<p>Restaurants are also sometimes run dreadfully. There's a particular type of chef that just cannot delegate, cannot let go of the details. Some of the biggest names are barely breaking even - in recent news the ""best restaurant in the world"" shut down, having never made a profit!<p>Then there's communication: People running restaurants are often all over the country, hard to get hold of, it's quite difficult to get decisions made.<p>On splash screens etc: If the client wants it, they want it. You can try to talk them out of it but at the end of the day if they insist, you gotta build it, and sometimes what they ask for just isn't easily possible without flash (sorry!)<p>It's a bit unfair to pick on restaurants, to be honest. Pick a random, non-chain business off your high street. How good is their website? How many of them use flash? A lot of low-end websites are still in that quagmire, but the meat of it is that you don't need to visit the website for most of these businesses but for restaurants the web has become critical, so you notice it more.<p>Lastly, to anyone out there that does make restaurant websites: Push back. Try to explain to your clients why it's not such a great idea to use flash, or intro screens. Try to explain the use-cases etc, and above all show them there is a very good business case for having a good website. My current employer actually specialises in restaurant websites and I'm really, genuinely proud of what we're doing - and our clients love it too. It takes effort and it's risky, but helping your client have the best website possible can pay off.<p>Edit: Between this article and the recent attack from Cracked, I'm feeling a little under siege, especially as both were fairly light on actual facts. An issue that came up in both:<p>> This is because restaurants often don't have tools to update the text on their sitessaving and replacing a PDF file of a menu is easier than messing with the code on the site<p>This is a horrible simplification. In many cases the PDF menu is produced by a design agency, which is certainly a lot more effort than updating text on a website. It's also not hard to code either a PDF uploader or a page text editor or both, but you'll find plenty pick the PDF uploader. If you spent that sort of money on a PDF, you'd want to upload it too! And of course the menus are often very designed and they want that control (which the article does cover on other points)<p>My question on this issue is: Is a PDF download really so bad? It's not something I personally find particularly intrusive and for a restaurant menu it seems suitable enough.",1312932331

At first, I thought details like curly brackets, parenthesis and so on would put them off, but not a single person had a problem with that, to my surprise.<p>You might say that significant whitespace (i.e. the indentation level signifies structure) is a more natural way, but when you think about it there's no where else in these peoples lives where indentation of text determines it's function or effect. When you e.g. in Word indent text it's a purely visual effect (which might imply or give greater meaning to structure, but not define it). Thus, significant whitespace is not as natural as parenthesis and -- it turns out -- curly braces.<p>Now, I only did qualitative research and have yet to see a large uptake in usage. I personally use Move for 95% of everything I write nowadays and I have colleagues and friends who are also writing things in Move, so I guess time will tell if this is actually a more ""natural"" programming language than, say, JavaScript.<p>I recently wrote this update on the Move language.

I don't have to throw away an entire headlight in order to upgrade, and I don't want to throw away heavy aluminum light bulbs either.  I have no idea if there's a market in this, but Nate's money is on the table.<p>Now, if you you really knew this subject well, you might have pointed out that cooling requirements are pretty specific to the type of LED and driver, and are likely to change rapidly, thus making current shrouds and heat sinks subject to imminent obsolescence.  Or you might have pointed out the possibility that remote phosphors will catch on widely, which would seriously complicate the whole arrangement.  Or you might have pointed out the fact that the economics of manufacturing mass-market lighting appears to favor arrays of cheap LEDs over single expensive LEDs, which would obviously make modularity difficult or impossible.<p>If indeed modularity would double the cost of a bulb, as you say, then that would obviously kill the idea as well.

Many corporate Java developers (a bunch that traditionally used Windows) can use Macs for work and enjoy some advantages in relation to those who use Windows.<p>You may argue that Linux is not as polished a Unix as OSX (I disagree, but smart people believe it), but no serious hacker thinks Windows is <i>acceptable</i> for development unless they are also targeting Windows for deployment.",1312931745

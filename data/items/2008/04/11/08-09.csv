160876,comment,160690,160690,0,0,iamdave,,,"It seems to me that most bloggers talking about the decline of Windows seems to be looking at things from the standpoint of an informed developer or consumer highly in touch with technology and modern innovation.<p>What these folks don't realize is that they only make up a wee bit of the marketplace using Windows, and it's going to take a lot more than talking above the heads of Lawyers, Doctors and Educators, using jargon only the blogger understands to convince people to make the transition to an operating system.  Sure enough, Dell rolled out a line of machines that powered Linux but one company doing this isn't going to change minds either.<p>People need to be immersed in other technologies, they need to know how they work, why they matter and how to make the applications to their operations.  Until then, Windows is going to enjoy the room it has in the operating system market because quite frankly: Windows just works for certain people, and those certain people make up the largest part of the market.<p>Sure, Vista was a flubb, but a lot of people toughed it out and eventually got used to it because they have no clue how to install other operating systems.  And even though installing Ubuntu is as simple as point and click, the barrier to entry is just too high because as far as they are concerned, they'd rather not bother messing with it for fear they may break something and never be able to use their computers again.<p>Someone link me to a blog that talks about the other side of Windows user experience, and maybe you'll have something worth talking.",1207904020

I don't recall seeing any on the front page for quite some time, aside from the latest one about the google noncompete.<p>There are a lot of other linkbait articles that float up to the front page. The ""businesshackers"" guy comes to mind. There have also been a number of completely vapid articles recently, such as the ""to be a programmer, you need these 10 things: 1. text editor..."" article. I can only hope these are linkbait for some SEO scam network; the thought that these articles are written and upmodded by actual hackers is too depressing.<p>Anyway, at least we know Valleywag is a ""real"" site which sometimes has humor or interesting gossip. The other linkbait sites that make it to the front page truly have nothing to offer. The current moderation scheme deals with Valleywag just fine. If you must ban, there are other sites which seem to be a higher priority.",1207903899

160868,comment,160408,160579,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I'd argue that Facebook has the best 'quality' when compared to the other social networks in the USA. The UI and feature set are much better than any of its competitors. Facebook is dominant in the USA; the only competitor is MySpace which seems to fill a different niche.<p>Facebook = keep tabs on people you know, or sorta know.<p>MySpace = meet random people you don't know, get spammed by porn bots, irritate your ex by posting salacious photos of yourself with a new fling, browse photos of potential mates in a criminally inappropriate age bracket from yourself, etc.",1207903040

It's about coordinating events among social groups, and Facebook is especially powerful at doing that among people who aren't very familiar with each other but have talked long enough to click ""Add to Friends.""",1207902834
160866,comment,160408,160489,0,0,sgibat,,,"it _is_ world changing for them. it completely restructures their social lives and the opportunities available to them for both serious and non-serious social interaction. facebook has had a larger impact on many people's lives than google. do you think most people really care about somewhat better search results and somewhat better webmail over having access to four times (pulled that number out of my ass, but you can bet that it's a multiplier) as many social events and people as they did before?",1207902721
160865,comment,160408,160840,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Shockingly, I have never met a passionate MySpace user before. I'm glad there are people like you out there. It adds balance.<p>MySpace is generally considered to be a poorly designed, unkept ""social network"" while Facebook is generally considered to be a clean, open, and sophisticated networking application. There is a very clear, highly researched demographic divide between the younger generation (middle/high school) using myspace and older, more sophisticated generation using Facebook. There is also a clear point of transfer, High School => College, where many people ""graduate"" to Facebook. It's a progression. (There are studies saying that MySpace also caters to the ""older"" population >30yo, but those are not the people I am considering.)<p>Facebook is not for everybody. I highly doubt the ""too old"" population I stereotyped will ever use Facebook. But as time goes on, I can see people in my generation (early twenties) replacing the ""too old"" generation while still using things like Facebook, so that huge market will slowly be absorbed.<p>There will always be a MySpace. It's amazingly good for connecting artists, like you mentioned. But it's still a shitty, poorly run, poorly designed, and non-user-centric organization. I wish Virb would have taken over.",1207902684

She does a much better job exploring their significance than random unsubstantiated comments in this rather inane discussion.",1207901896

160859,comment,160288,160358,0,0,st3fan,,,"""""""Does anybody have experience with Ubuntu Server?""""""<p>Ubuntu is great. We decided to go for Ubuntu because at the time we made that decision, Debian was still at 3.1 and very outdated. They have played catchup since then and 4.0 is much more modern (i'm mostly talking about more recent versions of popular stuff like postfix, postgres, mysql, gcc, etc.).<p>We standardized on 6.06/LTS but I've been also been playing with the 8.04/LTS release that is coming up. Looks very nice and we will probably switch to it. For new installations. Old stuff still runs rock solid.",1207901249

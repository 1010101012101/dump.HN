5274014,comment,5273498,5273802,8,0,dasil003,,,"It's a weird jump of logic to say that because the biggest Ruby project (Rails) is overkill for a particular architectural flavor (JS + REST backend) that this will lead to <i>Ruby's</i> decline.  Even assuming the market moves wholesale to pure REST backend (which is quite unlikely frankly, because not everything on the web is a CRUD-heavy app, documents still dominate), and Rails does not fit the bill (which is also arguable since moving to pure REST API only makes views/helpers irrelevant, which is at best 20% of Rails), then you would see other frameworks like Sinatra/Padrino rise to prominence.<p>The only way Ruby becomes irrelevant is if a new paradigm becomes dominant that just isn't easy to implement in Ruby.  Threaded/evented/asynchronous frameworks do fit the bill, but my sense is that enough people prefer Ruby so much to a language like Javascript (in the case of Node), that if something like web sockets become indispensable as an 80% use-case, then the Ruby community will figure out how to make it easier to use them.  I'm still using MRI which has some difficult problems to solve, but it seems JRuby is pretty much ready to pick up the slack if it really becomes necessary.",1361710220

FreeBSD, Nexenta (open source Solaris with a GNU userland), Debian/kfreeBSD and Debian/HURD are not Linux distributions, but they are operating system distributions.

I think eventually Python got to support both approaches.<p>I think Ruby is all objects even in its C abstractions. In Ruby, people create classes and so on in the RubyC abstractions that are visible to the Ruby language too. Not sure how Python does those.<p>I know Python has reference counting for Garbage Collection, so there are differences to their approaches in that regard and more.<p>Like Guido Van Rossum said, from 10,000 feet both Ruby and Python are more alike than different. He was saying that people should appreciate them more even if they belong to the community of the other one. That the real enemy is languages like Java that switch around the priority by making code that compilers prefer rather than programmers prefer.<p>I think Python has a Functions legacy that could not be as OO as they would be in Ruby.<p>Right now I'm more ""in love"" with Dart than with Ruby. Ruby was my first real love though.",1361707207

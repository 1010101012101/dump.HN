Sigh.  Why should USERS never have control, but you give bad designers a free pass?  That&#x27;s an awfully totalitarian view of computing, and leads to many unbearable situations.<p>> Of course, there are bad designers, but they get filtered out by users not going back to their site.<p>No.  As I mentioned in another comment, you can&#x27;t just pick-and-choose websites like equivalent oranges.  Each website is different, and while occasionally you can choose which blog you read, you can&#x27;t so easily select which government agency you need to engage with.  We all have to deal with the designer&#x27;s choices, good or bad.<p>A tangent, but back to this:<p>> the designer should have control over every pixel on his product.<p>How is it appropriate to discuss the web in this manner?  The web is a communication mechanism, and it was intended to be easy for people -- end users, real people -- to make their own webpages.  Now it&#x27;s just for &quot;products&quot; created by professional designers?  We have given up so much.",1434783499

9749243,comment,9743689,9743689,0,0,cel1ne,,,"That is not too surprising. On the one hand serotonine not only acts as a neurotransmitter, but has a mechanical function controlling blood-pressure and a multitude of other things as well.
(See this comment: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9476594"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9476594</a>)<p>Easier triggered bodily alertness in unpleasant situations probably creates a feedback-loop which shuts off rational thinking (frontal cortex) further -> anxiety.<p>On the other hand, I think a good metaphor for it&#x27;s complex role as a neurotransmitter is &quot;bandwidth&quot;. If your serotonine-levels are too low, some regions in your brain have trouble communicating with each other. Hence when your amygdala starts sending out signals of imminence, your rational prefrontal cortex might be able to think &quot;No need to be afraid.&quot;, but it&#x27;s not able to properly communicate that back. The other way around works too: the signals of imminence might not arrive clearly (&quot;I didn&#x27;t even realize I was afraid&quot;), so you can&#x27;t act properly.<p>If serotonine-levels are too high, this communication and loops might work TOO well. Imagine a &quot;weak non-specific signal&quot; from a confused (lack of a better word) amygdala that starts off a thought, which in turn throws the amygdala into a feedback-loop that you can&#x27;t get out off. In that situation it would have been easier if the weak signal would have been dismissed in the first place.",1434783263

This calls for cooperation to achieve peace and security, and calls for respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of &quot;all states.&quot; Both sides are alleged to have violated this over the years, NATO in the Balkans(Serbia-Kosovo), and Russia in the Caucasus.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware the only thing Russia&#x27;s done recently in the Caucasus was in Georgia. While Abhkhazia may be regarded as part of Georgia by the US/EU/West it has not been governed from Tblisi at any point since the fall of the Soviet Union. Another entirely accurate interpretation of the Georgian war was that Georgia took approving noises about it joining NATO from the US far too seriously, invaded Abhkhazia and was completely crushed by Russia.<p>Just goes to show you can&#x27;t count on the US, like when Russia, the US and UK all agreed to guarantee Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty in exchange for it giving up its nuclear weapons to Russia when the Soviet Union dissolved.",1434781045

It&#x27;s pretty far from &quot;literate programming&quot;.<p>I suppose one could argue that if you manage to simplify the structure of your program to the point that it reads like prose, one has a &quot;literate program&quot;. But it&#x27;s a strange use of the term. The core idea is to have the code be incidental to the commentary, so that, among other things, one would update the commentary whenever one change the program.<p>Laying out the comments in a funny way doesn&#x27;t quite do that. I first saw this with the &quot;literate&quot; re-write of coffee script, but perhaps it&#x27;s older?<p>Perhaps the difference between &quot;old&quot; literate programming, and this style (&quot;prose programming&quot;?) is similar to the difference between unit testing and TDD, or between TDD and BDD?",1434780561

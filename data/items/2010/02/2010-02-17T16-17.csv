1131863,comment,1131440,1131440,0,0,oconnore,,,"Well, I'm going to approach this from the political angle instead of the scientific angle, because I have my doubts about the accuracy of modern climate models. The Earth is really complex, and while single float thermodynamics equations recalculated on a grid map of the world are probably pretty close to reality, I have yet to see any reason why a few degrees error per century is unthinkable for these computer models.<p>That said, I have seen two political motions within AGW. One, to motivate people to consume less, to accept a reduction in their standard of living. Two, to motivate people to confront and resolve an issue in a sensible way with modern technologies. The latter actually makes sense, AGW or not, unless you really do like breathing exhaust fumes; unfortunately the former seems more common, and less acceptable.",1266425898

But we know from physics that it's a greenhouse gas.  It's not a privileged hypothesis we're pulling out of nowhere.  It's not like saying ""You can't prove there's no invisible pink unicorn in my garage!""  [Anthropological Global Warming] is, ceteris paribus, what we should expect to happen if the other things we believe are true.  We don't have any experimental results on what will happen 50 years from now, and so you can't grant the proposition the special, super-strong status of something that has been scientifically confirmed by a replicable experiment.  But as I point out in ""Scientific Evidence, Legal Evidence, Rational Evidence"", if science couldn't say anything about that which has not already been observed, we couldn't ever make scientific predictions by which the theories could be confirmed.  Extrapolating from the science we do know, global warming should be occurring; you would need specific experimental evidence to contradict that.<p>We are, I think, dealing with that old problem of motivated cognition.  As Gilovich says:  ""Conclusions a person does not want to believe are held to a higher standard than conclusions a person wants to believe.  In the former case, the person asks if the evidence compels one to accept the conclusion, whereas in the latter case, the person asks instead if the evidence allows one to accept the conclusion.""  People map the domain of belief onto the social domain of authority, with a qualitative difference between absolute and nonabsolute demands:  If a teacher tells you certain things, and you have to believe them, and you have to recite them back on the test.  But when a student makes a suggestion in class, you don't have to go along with it - you're free to agree or disagree (it seems) and no one will punish you.</i>",1266425057

Essentially different real-life scenarios were presented to demonstrate the extent foreign governments will go to gain classified information.<p>An easy example I remember being presented was a case where a foreign government may find out about a defense contractor conference and will send someone to nearby hotels to just sit around at the lounge bar and simply strike up conversations with those around.  Needless to say, most people with a few drinks in them and a friendly person to talk to will be fairly candid with who they are, where they work, where they live, what they do, etc, etc, etc.  All of this information would then be compiled into a folder on an individual and once enough data is collected it could potentially be used to blackmail or maybe even counterfeit someone's identity to steal government secrets.<p>To me, the main goal of the training was to demonstrate how easily another person or government could gather extensive personal information on an individual and potentially use it to gain access to government secrets.

They said that the models' predictions didn't correspond to what they thought that they were seeing from the measurements.<p>It didn't correspond to <i>tree-ring measurements</i>. Which is already an unreliable and lossy sort of data, so they applied corrections for other phenomenon. And if it were a primary line of evidence in the case for climate change there might be a problem. But, as it stands, they were not and it was not.<p>Further, at this point, all the work they did is replicable. The orignal data was not lost, it simply wasn't kept at that facility (for a variety of reasons). The IPCC is investigating any serious wrongdoing and having an independent group check the results.<p>> How about telling us what you'd take as a statement or evidence that AGW wasn't happening?<p>Sort of like asking, ""What you'd take as evidence that evolution isn't real."" At this point it'd need to be fairly extraordinary, since there is a LOT of data (both observed and modeled) that supports the hypothesis.<p>So I dunno. Do you have anything better than, ""One statistician disagrees with Al Gore's movie from 4 years ago but agrees with the IPCC?"" Or maybe, ""These people did something with data that I don't understand and called it a trick, I <i>knew</i> those guys were up to something!"" Maybe something to counter the EIS footage? Or perhaps data to argue against the basic tenants? Is there actually much less CO2 in the air than claimed?<p>What evidence would you take that it is happening? Epochal records of CO2 content in the air? We have that. Clear evidence of sharp and sudden environmental change in temperature sensitive areas? We have a ton of that; some of it is incredibly dramatic. Decade-term data that still shows overall warming trends? We've got that and its far more reliable than the extreme longterm data. Clear chemistry explaining what should happen? The base science backs this up.<p>Do we have absolutely conclusive proof yet? <i>No.</i> Do we have enough evidence to start taking this seriously? <i>Yes, I believe my threshold is met.</i> Do post-industrialized nations like America stand to gain a lot financially by embracing this? I think we have much more to gain (and a lot to lose if we let China continue to outpace us in renewable energy research and production).

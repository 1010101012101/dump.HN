They would pump their millions of dollars as a large player in the industry into this effort, and music listening becomes de-facto based on the Spotify platform because they&#x27;ve invested in a deal that would bring free music streaming to the masses of impoverished and (musically) underserved Americans.<p>Smaller streaming services such as Bandcamp, with their selfish capitalistic intent on charging for their services directly, cannot compete with the pervasiveness and free-ness of Spotify services. People cannot fathom why they would pay to buy music when Spotify is so generously providing it for free (faster loading, free, and doesn&#x27;t use up their data allotments!) included in their ISP plan.<p>Far down in the future Spotify realizes they don&#x27;t have to improve their services anymore.

There&#x27;s a reason some people are simply writing &#x27;available&#x27; drivers from scratch.<p>> any software development after the initial release (and maybe some bug fixes) is more of a burden than value add.<p>Quite right. For example: ST&#x27;s STM32F4 is a nice chip. The drivers in both the &#x27;standard peripheral&#x27; and the &#x27;HAL&#x27;[1] versions are a mess. The &#x27;HAL&#x27; version looks like a junior developer who would rather move into management had the &#x27;std. peripheral&#x27; version dropped onto his desk and proceeded to split it into parts without knowing or caring about what abstraction means.<p>Compared to that, Atmel&#x27;s code is a dream. (Irrespective of whether you approve off the number of (thin) layers used to implement their HALs, you have to admire the amount of thought that went into the design. Unfortunately Atmel was slow in getting onto the ARM wagon.)<p>>Resource constraints come in a lot, many companies try to support way too many products, and end up with a level of &quot;barely&quot; making it work, which is good enough for many traditional customers.<p>Getting back to redoing a lot of things:\nTI has some strong low power wireless connectivity products.

10800516,comment,10799124,10799999,0,0,dietrichepp,,,"This response really resonates with me.<p>There&#x27;s an experience I had several times when I was growing up and going through school, where I would ask someone for advice and they&#x27;d give me some well-reasoned, thoughtful answer, then the advice turned out to be unhelpful.  This happened often when I talked to academic advisers.  I realized afterwards that my academic advisers were giving me exactly the kind of advice that would have suited them when they were my age, and since I was a different person with different goals, a different background, and different circumstances, their advice was simply ill-suited.<p>The thing that really struck me, however, is the realization that they truly believed in the advice they gave me, and that they had grounds to believe in it.  It wasn&#x27;t &quot;bad advice&quot; per se, but they talked to hundreds of students every year and couldn&#x27;t take the time to understand what my goals were.  And I realized that I was going along a nontraditional path, I had nontraditional goals, I was deliberately nonconformist, and therefore academic advisers (as extremely conformist individuals, in general) were the least reliable source of advice for me.<p>I&#x27;ve started recognizing the pattern more and more.  Someone will give advice, and they&#x27;ll be earnest and honest, but it just doesn&#x27;t apply to everybody.  I had a teacher who thought &quot;happiness&quot; was a fool&#x27;s dream.  I met a recovered addict who had a sure-fire plan, with five steps, to beat addiction and improve your life.  He wanted to tell everyone that MDMA would ruin your chances for ever living a happy life.  I met a divorcé with some advice which women to avoid, or how to treat them.  It was advice that he needed, years ago, but I didn&#x27;t.  Same thing over and over again, people claiming to know what would make other people happy.  (Or replace &quot;happy&quot; with adjective of your choice.)<p>And I suppose I am repeating the pattern, right here.  &quot;You have to learn to recognize what advice applies to you and what advice doesn&#x27;t, because you&#x27;re smart, and there are a great many mistakes you won&#x27;t make, even though there are many you will.&quot;<p>But that&#x27;s the advice that I needed, fifteen years ago, it&#x27;s not the advice you need.  And maybe this story won&#x27;t resonate with you at all, because you thought it was obvious all along.  That&#x27;s the lesson.",1451295715

Clayton financed it for her with a Vanderbilt loan at a 15.77 annual percentage rate, after a down payment of $7,000.<p>When she and Leroy returned for the closing, they said that, like many other buyers, they were rushed through it. Agents quickly turned over page after page, saying, “You need to sign right here, sign here, sign here,” recalled Leroy, who said he has been unable to work since he went blind in his right eye.<p>The monthly payments were $851 — about $100 more than the amount she received from her fixed disability payments. Shorts, who said she didn’t realize how much she would have to pay every month, made just two payments, then defaulted in June 2014. Clayton filed to seize the home that October.<p>Even when loans go bad quickly, the sale can be profitable for Berkshire Hathaway. Clayton often marks up new homes about 70 percent over invoice, company documents show. After a 20 percent down payment and thousands of dollars in fees added into the loan, Clayton can recoup more than half the wholesale price of the home in a year.<p>When borrowers stop paying, the company can repossess and resell the home, again with another markup.",1451295077

Allow me to share:<p>A paper (Bessen, Maskin - 1999) that argues patents may hinder innovation[1]. Abstract:<p>&quot;<i>How could such industries as software, semiconductors, and computers have been so innovative despite historically weak patent protection? We argue that if innovation is both sequential and complementary—as it certainly has been in those industries—competition can increase firms’ future profits thus offsetting short-term dissipation of rents. A simple model also shows that in such a dynamic industry, patent  protection may reduce overall innovation and social welfare. The natural experiment that occurred when patent protection was extended to software in the 1980&#x27;s provides a test of this model. Standard arguments would predict that R&D intensity and productivity should have increased among patenting firms.\nConsistent with our model, however, these increases did not occur. Other evidence supporting our model includes a distinctive pattern of cross-licensing in these industries and a positive relationship between rates of innovation and firm entry.</i>&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s another paper on the same topic (Bessen, Hunt - 2004). Abstract:<p>&quot;<i>U.S. legal changes have made it easier to obtain patents on inventions that use software.\nSoftware patents have grown rapidly and now comprise 15 percent of all patents. They\nare acquired primarily by large manufacturing firms in industries known for strategic\npatenting; only 5 percent belong to software publishers. The very large increase in\nsoftware patent propensity over time is not adequately explained by changes in R&D\ninvestments, employment of computer programmers, or productivity growth. The residual\nincrease in patent propensity is consistent with a sizeable rise in the cost effectiveness of\nsoftware patents during the 1990s. We find evidence that software patents substitute for\nR&D at the firm level; they are associated with lower R&D intensity. This result occurs\nprimarily in industries known for strategic patenting and is difficult to reconcile with the\ntraditional incentive theory of patents.</i>&quot;<p>An abstract from another paper (Bessen, Meuer, Ford - 2011) showing that lawsuits by non-practicing entities have cost the tech industry $500 billion over a 20 year period (from 1990 to 2010), with almost none of it going to the inventors:<p>&quot;<i>In the past, non-practicing entities (NPEs) - firms that license patents without producing goods - have facilitated technology markets and increased rents for small inventors. Is this also true for today’s NPEs? Or are they “patent trolls” who opportunistically litigate over software patents with unpredictable boundaries? Using stock market event studies around patent lawsuit filings, we find that NPE lawsuits are associated with half a trillion dollars of lost wealth to defendants from 1990 through 2010, mostly from technology companies. Moreover, very little of this loss represents a transfer to small inventors. Instead, it implies reduced innovation incentives.</i>&quot;<p>And an abstract from yet another paper (Feldman, Lemley - 2015) showing that patent licenses do not drive innovation:<p>&quot;<i>A commonly offered justification for patent trolls or non-practicing entities (NPEs) is that they serve as a middleman, facilitating innovation and bringing new technology from inventors to those who can implement it. We survey those involved in patent licensing to see how often patent license demands actually led to innovation or technology transfer. We find that very few patent license demands actually lead to new innovation; most simply involve payment for the freedom to keep doing what the licensee was already doing. Surprisingly, this is true not only of NPE licenses but even of licenses from product-producing companies and universities. Our results cast significant doubt on one common justification for patent trolls.</i>&quot;<p>And finally, a paper (Johnson - 2011) that argues, using recent advances in relevant fields, that the fundamental belief that external incentives such as copyrights and patents are necessary for innovation is fundamentally wrong:<p>&quot;<i>The enterprise of intellectual property law has long been based on the premise that external incentives – such as copyrights and patents – are necessary to get people to produce artistic works and technological innovations. This article argues that this foundational belief is wrong. Using recent advances in behavioral economics, psychology, and business-management studies, along with empirical investigations of industry, it is now possible to construct a compelling case that the incentive theory, as a general matter, is mistaken, and that natural and intrinsic motivations will cause technology and the arts to flourish even in the absence of externally supplied rewards. The result is that intellectual property law itself needs a fundamental rethinking.</i>&quot;<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.researchoninnovation.org/patent.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchoninnovation.org/patent.pdf</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.researchoninnovation.org/swpat.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchoninnovation.org/swpat.pdf</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1930272"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1930272</a>\n[4]: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2565292"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2565292</a>\n[5]: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1746343"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1746343</a><p>--<p>In fact, the <i>only</i> real evidence we have that patents may be a net positive is in biotech, and that&#x27;s due to the extremely time-consuming and massively expensive process of R&D in that field.

What you could do is push for <i>increasing</i> the safety (at the cost of something else, obviously). What you&#x27;re looking for is preventing avoidable mistakes, and minimizing damage if Something Really Bad happens.",1451293300

When it comes to application state however, that&#x27;s when I whip out React&#x27;s context (now documented <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html</a>). I follow the pattern of Redux/Baobab of having a monolithic state and partitioning it by module namespace (to avoid data dependency issues, e.g. Flux&#x27;s waitFor hell <a href=""http://christianalfoni.github.io/javascript/2015/02/06/plant-a-baobab-tree-in-your-flux-application.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://christianalfoni.github.io/javascript/2015/02/06/plant...</a>). Each module manages its slice of state and exposes an API for encapsulation. This also plays really well with React Router. In other words, the application state and the actions that can be performed on the state are passed down through the context. I prefer Redux&#x27;s concept of smart/dumb components (<a href=""https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.t5fhdnhsc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7c...</a>) to make sure the application state isn&#x27;t being spaghettied all over the code. With Mobservable, there&#x27;s a specific part of their documentation which I think does a decent job of explaining a similar set up: <a href=""https://mweststrate.github.io/mobservable/best/store.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mweststrate.github.io/mobservable/best/store.html</a>",1451293204

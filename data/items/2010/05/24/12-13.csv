However ...<p>According to PG, in his opinion it's the quality of the comments that's mostly causing the site to decline.  From that point of view the suggestion doesn't really help.<p>There are multiple problems, perhaps there should be multiple solutions/tweaks/features to attack them.  Karma is well-known to be a blunt and faulty instrument, and making loads of minor tweaks to that single instrument in the hope of fixing all the problems might be the wrong way to go.<p>Enculturating newbies is part of the problem - it's no longer happening.  Using crowd-sourcing for assessment of quality is thereby being harmed, because people are just upvoting, and submitting, things they like and that make them smile.  We want new users with new comments, new interests and new submissions, but the site needs to retain its focus, otherwise it will become another ""submit this 'cos it's cute"" site.<p>Crowd-sourcing is needed to help the site scale. Newbies are needed to keep the site fresh.  Old hands are needed to keep the site focussed.<p>What seems to me to be missing is a feedback mechanism for people to learn why their submission/comments are less valued on this site specifically, and ways to concentrate that judgement in the hands of those whose judgement matches what PG wants.<p>I have ideas, although they are all rather baroque, and I'm sure many others here have ideas as well.  In all liklihood they won't be implemented, because PG doesn't have the time to evaluate them all sufficiently.  Again, what's needed is for those with the vision that matches PG's to find an easily implemented, transparent, appropriate, fair and ""good enough"" solution.<p>Maybe having submissions costing karma will work.  I merely offered an aspect that needs to be considered.",1274705796

Me, I do work in business and science and I think it'd be irresponsible to potentially allow 50% control of my research, writings, and businesses I found/work in/develop/etc to go to someone else.

Sprint has already announced plans that WiFi hotspot service will be $30/mo with their Android 2.1 EVO.  It is unreasonable to believe that Sprint is going to let Android 2.2 devices tether for free and charge $30/mo for older devices.  In the end, this feature will likely end up similar to iPhone tethering.  If you're willing to ""jailbrake"" the phone, it's there.  Of course, it's likely that carriers will be able to detect tethering (it really shouldn't be too hard) and call up the user to tell them that they have to stop or a $XX charge will be added to their account monthly for tethering usage.  They might even add the charge without alerting the user - how many people who don't have a data plan get charged without being alerted when they accidentally hit the web button on their phone?  I don't think it's wholly unreasonable to believe that carriers might do the same for tethering.<p>As much as we'd all like to think that Google's in the driver's seat fighting for users rights when Apple won't stand up for them, it's still the networks who are the gatekeepers.

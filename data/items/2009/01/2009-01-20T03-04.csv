My favorite part is that you can fit the whole app in one file, if you want to (since templates, database models, etc. are all optional). It's the Python web framework that gets closest to the PHP experience of instant results.<p>Django is probably a better choice for jumping right into CRUD apps and numbing the pain of SQL, though. There's more to deal with up front, but you have a more complete system after the first hour than you do with web.py.",1232423608

As a financial intermediary, that's basically what a VC does: allocate capital and manage risk.<p>VCs have sole responsibility for investing and managing the capital that they raise for which they get paid handsomely (often 2% of AuM annually and 20% of profits, if any).  Entrepreneurs have no control over and get no remuneration for allocating capital or managing risk.<p>So what if there are too many ""me too"" entrepreneurs seeking funding.  So what if there are a bunch of wacko founders pitching ""hover boards.""  So what if innovation is dead.  If VCs can't allocate capital or manage risk then they should decline to invest and return the money to their limited parters.<p>Stop blaming entrepreneurs for something that isn't their fault.  There's plenty enough to blame them for that is their fault.",1232423118

Being a casual investor you can leave $ as cash until an opportunity arises.  You don't need to invest in this current landslide until the smoke clears, big firms and anyone who has already lost money is already committed (few will cut their losses).<p>You also have the luxury of just needing to choose one or two good companies.  Drop the $2000 in Microsoft in the early days and you would be a rich man.  Take that lesson to today, and maybe you think RIMM is oversold and will be the dominant mobile player for the next 10 years.  You put your chips there, and not spread out over 5 mobile stocks.<p>I realize those two things are very difficult to do (timing and selection), but I do think certain individuals can do it better than the rest of the market.<p>My biggest point though:  Don't waste ANY time in the market until you have enough money so that the difference between 3% returns and 5% is meaningful.  2K + the market == a waste of your time, as others have suggested invest that into yourself.",1232422197

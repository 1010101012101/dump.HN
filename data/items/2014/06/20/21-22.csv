7923102,comment,7920820,7922845,0,0,zecho,,,"The canard is that you&#x27;ve accepted that there&#x27;s a &quot;primary message&quot; of &quot;do what you love&quot; or &quot;the-world-is-your-oyster&quot; without showing how it has actually affected society. I argue that the perception of such a message has had nothing to do with any of youth&#x27;s current economic woes.<p>It completely sidesteps the real issues. Let&#x27;s say nobody told any young child of the 80s and 90s that they were special and the entire job market shifted on them anyway. They&#x27;d still be living at their parents&#x27; house, because they have no jobs, high debt and not much of a financial independence ahead of them. It&#x27;s a logical thing to do when your parents have stable incomes and you do not.<p>Please read through my other comments in this thread, but my point is that the entire market shifted, which we agree on. Where I disagree, and frankly, get really annoyed about, is placing the blame on how these students were raised for wholly unrelated economic trajectories.<p>This has nothing to do with expectations and everything to do with realities. Realities that are being dealt with by boomeranging.<p>As for &quot;WHY do these kids have high debt and low wages,&quot; I&#x27;ve also discussed, but blaming debt-to-wage ratio for choice of study seems bizarre to me when the problem is school is more expensive than ever and jobs are scarcer than ever, especially for recent graduates. They have high debt and low wages because they have high debt and low wages. An ontology, for sure, but just as likely a vicious cycle: One must have a degree to get a good job in one&#x27;s chosen field, but having a degree may no longer advance one&#x27;s position and yet, not having a degree could be far worse.<p>As noted throughout this thread, students have been choosing essentially the same degrees for decades, regardless of job prospects in those fields. The things that changed to create the boomerang problem (assuming we see it as a problem), are all outside of those choices: increasing education costs, poorer job prospects across nearly all fields, etc. etc.<p>If job prospects were related to field of study, you&#x27;d expect to see shifts in completed degree fields over the years, but we don&#x27;t.<p>So back to the &quot;primary message,&quot; as you put it. Was it inherent in that message that students get similar degrees as boomers and Gen Xers? It worked for them just fine. Why wouldn&#x27;t it work for their kids? Seems hardly criminally negligent or idiotic to me and, again, it&#x27;s completely unrelated to the real economic reality. To me, that framing sounds a lot like &quot;kids these days&quot; and doesn&#x27;t isn&#x27;t helpful at all, especially when it appears &quot;kids will be kids&quot; seems the more apt cliche to use when talking about choice of degree.",1403301206

Many, if not most, schools in the U.S. resemble prisons. Top-down. Hierarchical. Rigid.

Instead of calling it welfare or charity, with the implication that those who receive it are living off the backs of others, and are themselves lazy, it&#x27;s just something everyone receives.<p>2) If the hypothetical couple&#x27;s total expenses are $15k/month, and they can&#x27;t gear down their lifestyle to $5k/month before running out of savings, I&#x27;d propose they weren&#x27;t really living responsibly. $5k/month is enough to subsist, albiet not luxuriously, in pretty much any part of the U.S.<p>The alternative is going from $15k/mo. to $0/mo. That extra $5k could either keep a family solvent.<p>3) <i>even if</i> it merely delays the inevitable, that might be good enough.

7923074,comment,7869461,7869461,1,0,tylermccall,,,"I read an interview recently where Ray Bradbury said Fahrenheit 451 was never a story about censorship or McCarthyism.  It was about television not being a substitute for literature.  It fills us with useless information and could be used as channel for state sponsored indoctrination.  Come to think of it, I think he also talked about it creating a society where everyone is a minority and political correctness reaches the point of absurdity.  Books must be burned because they will always offend someone.  Replace “television” with “Internet” and it becomes frighteningly prophetic.<p>While you were describing how the Internet effects context, I couldn’t help but keep wondering how this is any different than anything ever written down throughout history.  Anytime someone puts pen to paper, or now types a key, are they not giving up a bit of that ability to control context?  That has weighed heavily in my mind and kept me from clicking enter on at least half of the posts or comments I have begun to write online.<p>Whose job is it to convey context?  I wish we could rely on the media or journalists to inject that proper context you speak of.  I find myself dwelling far too often on whether or not there should be some kind of journalistic standards or oversight for the news.  We have it for medicine and other public services or things that could harm our well-being.  Should people be held accountable for the information they put out in the world, especially if they are claiming to be delivering news?  But that borders far to closely to censorship for my taste, and I back away from the thought.<p>I think the only way to maintain proper context is for people to develop stronger critical thinking skills.  People must have a properly maintained sense of skepticism.  We need to be able to read something and understand that there is history, context and complexities to it.   I’m honestly not sure most people even understand the concept of context.   The answer laid in front of us, whatever is the easiest explanation, usually seems to win.  It’s easier to assume Edward Snowden is a traitor who took refuge in Russia because, of course.   Who cares why he actually ended up in Russia, he is there now so that’s the story.<p>I put it with what you said about wisdom, it’s important to be able to understand and accept that there are countless points of view.   Ultimately, I think the responsibility falls on the recipient, because you should never assume someone is setting the context properly for you.  Far too often the media seems to not want to deliver any proper context, and they actively work to misrepresent the author.    And I couldn’t agree more that this is likely a predictable consequence of capitalism.",1403300794

The idea is that it&#x27;s set at a level where you&#x27;re not going to die, you&#x27;re not going to end up homeless, you&#x27;re just not going to be very comfortable.<p>As for how it&#x27;s different from welfare/social security/disability - I usually see it pitched as a way of unifying all of those (and the EITC), so that people don&#x27;t fall through the cracks because they don&#x27;t know how to sign up or what they&#x27;re entitled to.

Now, hacker news does have the X-Frame-Option Deny, but let&#x27;s assume it doesn&#x27;t.<p>So to figure out my hacker news username, all you have to do now is create an iframe with hacker news, and then getPixel on the area of the frame that contains usernames, run some trivial OCR, and done.<p>Now, this issue is even more serious in other instances.

When a new technology comes out, all you need is familiarity with the technology and with existing processes to understand where a manual process could be automated outright.  This is the domain of enterprise startups founded by people with deep knowledge of an industry and a keen interest in new technology.<p>Once those opportunities have been picked clean, entrepreneurs look for cases where they could use technology to let a disenfranchised group do the work of an enfranchised group.  They take the people who have been rendered out of work in stage 1, and then give them the tools to put higher-skilled workers out of work in stage 2.  Doing this requires a strong understanding of both the processes of the industry that will be cannibalized, and an understanding of the capabilities of the workers that will take their job, and an understanding of the technology that lets you bridge the former and the latter.  So entrepreneurs here need to do a lot of synthesis and need a bit of &quot;in the right place at the right time&quot; as well.<p>Once those opportunities are picked clean, then entrepreneurs start looking for things that people <i>want to do</i> but currently can&#x27;t because they lack the means.  This is where the great consumer companies of the next age are formed.  It&#x27;s very risky business for the entrepreneur, though, because there is essentially zero data available on what things people would like to do if they could but can&#x27;t currently.  Usually entrepreneurs that succeed here do so via vision, creativity, and a good sense of what they themselves want to do.<p>We&#x27;re currently just starting stage 2 in the Internet/mobile/cloud revolution, so I would expect more job destruction and more short-term social pain in the near term.  But it stops when all the easy opportunities of stage 1 and stage 2 have been picked clean, and people are forced to hunt for consumer business models that employ all the people put out of work by the earlier stages.  Stage 1 and 2 destroy jobs, but stage 3 creates them.<p>BTW, for the last major economic transition (the Gilded Age and Industrial Revolution), the stages looked like this:<p>1. Sailors => Steamboats.  Weavers => power looms.  Blacksmiths => Steelmaking.  Coachmen => Railroads.  Miners => bulldozers, excavators, and heavy equipment.  Domestic servants => home appliances.<p>2. Railroads => Automobiles.  Whalers => Oil.  Coal miners => Oil.  Messengers => telegraphs.  Farmers => Meatpacking/agribusiness.<p>3. Electricity.  Home appliances (part of this industry replaced domestic servants, but part let consumers do genuinely new things, like microwaves and blenders).  Penicillin.  Air conditioning.  Airliners.  Elevators.  Refrigerators.  Computers (kicking off the next revolution).<p>Note that there&#x27;s a large overlap between the stages.  The last stage 1 business, replacing domestic servants with vacuum cleaners and washing machines, didn&#x27;t happen until after WW2, while the first stage 3 business, electricity, happened in the late 19th century.  I think we&#x27;ve seen the same thing with the Internet age, where Google and PayPal were among the first Stage 3 businesses, but Stage 2 hadn&#x27;t even happened yet.<p>The general pattern is based on who&#x27;re the substitutes for each industry.  Stage 1 substitutes machines for labor.  Stage 2 substitutes labor for labor with the help of machines to do things more efficiently.  Stage 3 uses machines (built by labor) to solve unfulfilled human desires.",1403298515

Responses can vary because the survey designs and the wording of questions differ.<p>But researchers say the survey done by the center at the University of Chicago is crucial because it has consistently tracked gun ownership since 1973, asking if respondents “happen to have in your home (or garage) any guns or revolvers.”<p>The center’s 2012 survey, conducted mostly in person but also by phone, involved interviews with about 2,000 people from March to September and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.<p>Gallup, which asks a similar question but has a different survey design, shows a higher ownership rate and a more moderate decrease.

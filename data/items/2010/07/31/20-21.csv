I think this age group never has that much trouble meeting friends, since they are still in school, see a lot of people, maybe are less picky than older people in who they interact with, etc. So, historically, there isn't much need for a website for under-21s to find friends, but maybe this is not the case with today's youth.<p>I may be wrong here, but I think any site that would want to attack this problem and find enough people who would use it would have to do it for people who are older than 21, maybe people above 25 or 30?

1564225,comment,1563618,1563618,0,0,viraptor,,,"I agree with the post completely - it's correct, detailed, etc. Yet, I think it completely misses the point of the original comparison. Most of the time when I use Perl, it's because I need something extremely simple - something like sending some specifically generated bytes over TCP, or running <i>perl -e 'print ""a""x40'</i> in the console. I don't need ""Parser manipulation"", ""Advanced object system"", ""autoboxing"", ""Coroutines"", ""Parse tree manipulation"", etc.<p>So why are they loaded at all? Is Perl6 supposed to be only for ""proper applications"" and medium-sized systems with their own DSLs? Are the famous ""Perl one-liners"" dead as far as Perl6 is concerned? I agree with the comments on LWN that said - yeah - you can optimise it, but to bring it down to perl5 level, you'd need to start dropping features loaded ""by default"".<p>Or maybe that's not the point? Maybe Perl6 is supposed to be a new language for writing applications? Noone complains that Java is starting too slowly to write scripts in it (or they're insane), then again previous versions of Java weren't primarily used for scripting (so there are no expectations like that).",1280609172

Douglas Stone, a physicist at Yale University. “It’s an amazing trick.”</i><p>If it's a <i>material</i>:<p>><i>Instead of amplifying light into coherent pulses, as a laser does, an antilaser absorbs light beams zapped into it.</i><p>><i>Stone and his colleagues thought up the antilaser while wondering what might happen if they replaced the material inside a laser that reflects photons — the “gain medium” — with a material that absorbs light. In the right configuration, the absorbing material sucks up most of the photons sent into it, while the remaining light waves cancel out by interfering with one another.</i><p>then it's... an electrically-operated optical switch?  Why not just state that?<p>If it's an optical switch, it's pretty awesome, granted, but the article doesn't seem to be implying that except in a very low-importance way (and still ambiguous about beam / material).

I aimed for something a little more ambitious: three blog posts a week.<p>I've managed it so far, but it takes a lot of time and most of my effort is making sure a post comes out on time. One of the great things about this is that I've really had to focus in on collecting interesting topics to write about; the bad thing about this is that most of the iterative parts of the writing process are cut out; I'm exercising just the ""initial drafting"" writing muscle, so to speak.<p>I want to keep blogging three times a week until the end of this year, for the sake of continuity, but from there, I think I'll probably tune down the frequency and work on the post-processing aspects of writing a little more.

1564206,comment,1562730,1564026,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Those kinds of shortcuts of are very typical of Emacs defaults, but you can rebind them. Here's how.<p>First, find the name of the function you want to rebind. Press C-h k (describe-key), and then the normal shortcut for the command you want to rebind. It should open a help buffer beginning with e.g. ""C-x C-e runs the command something-hyphenated"". That's your command name. (You can get a list of <i>all</i> commands in clojure's mode by pressing C-h m, which might be quicker if you're redefining several.)<p>Then, set up a mode-specific hook (something that runs when you edit a buffer in that mode). Add this to your Emacs config:<p><pre><code>    (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'my-clojure-mode-hook)\n</code></pre>\n(or whatever the clojure mode is called, I haven't used clojure). Finally, define your mode hook and add custom local keybindings with local-set-key. It should look like this:<p><pre><code>    (defun my-clojure-mode-hook ()\n      (local-set-key (kbd ""better-shortcut"") 'name-of-command)\n      (local-set-key (kbd ""better-shortcut-2"") 'name-of-second-command))\n</code></pre>\nWhere (kbd ""better-shortcut"") is in the usual Emacs keyboard shortcut notation, like (kbd ""C-M-e"").* To figure out what this is for a key, you can press C-h k again, followed by your shortcut. It will say ""X is unbound"", ""X is assemble-delicious-sandwich"", or whatever. The X part is what Emacs calls that key combination.<p>* You don't strictly need the (kbd ""string"") form, but it's probably the simplest form to use - you can press C-x C-e after the (kbd _) form to verify that it recognizes the key description.<p>Anything else you want to run when you start editing clojure code can go in the mode hook, too. Let me know if you have any questions. While I haven't done much with clojure, I know customizing Emacs pretty well, and adding keybindings like this works for any mode. You just need to know what the mode is called.",1280607954

While the results were encouraging, I lost motivation and it just collected dust for all that time.  In the past 3 weeks I've revived the project and given new life to it.<p>The project started when I wondered: ""What if delicious tag signatures were vectors, would their nearest neighbors in n-dimensional space be a good match for similarity?""  The answer took awhile to figure out, but it was a yes.  For me at least, it wasn't an easy problem to solve; finding the nearest neighbors with each vector having 10 dimensions, with total dimensional space about 50,000.  Figuring out a way to solve this in a timely manner was a joy.<p>At the time this project was first started and the first prototype completed, there were absolutely zero sites, other than google's sub-par ""similar"" link, that offered this.  Well, there was ""similicious"" but its index was tiny, and results weren't too impressive.  Now I count 5 full fledged services that do a pretty good job.  Some are ranked quit highly and probably make a decent buck.

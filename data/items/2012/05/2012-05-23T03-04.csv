It's unlikely that the Facebook IPO not blowing up on the first day will be enough to let out all the air of the bubble or at least let it out faster than it is getting put in. The truth is that the market for all other types of equity and debt based securities is pretty shit right now and that tech startups are relatively attractive psychologically to investors because they provide hope and the dream of a better future. Most other investment types involve a lot more cold and calculating decisions and don't benefit from irrational investment behaviors.",1337745596

What about apps that were non-Google when you downloaded them but were later bought by Google? And on and on.<p>Plus, other people are going to draw the line in different places. Should Google present a giant switchboard where you can decide exactly what to keep and what to get rid of? I feel sure that if they had, someone else would be here talking about Google's ""social engineering"" because they make the process of deactivating your Google account on an Android device so complicated.<p>The overwhelmingly commonest case for deactivating the primary Google account on an Android device is because you're giving that device to someone else. In that case you almost always actively want a factory reset. It is entirely reasonable for Google to keep things simple and optimize for that.<p>In most other cases, the data (not apps) you're talking about is either backed up to your Google account and/or can be straightforwardly backed up another way (e.g. apps letting you export to the SD card, emailing yourself notes, etc.). Dealing with those sorts of issues in your corner case isn't an unreasonable burden (contrast this with the Facebook situation, where almost everyone exporting their contacts from Facebook wants the email addresses, too).",1337745261

4011438,comment,4010297,4011147,16,0,scarmig,,,"You could just as well rewrite that for any other politically convenient target:<p>We are not going to evolve as a society until we abolish corporatized capital. I know that this is a strong statement. And it is likely to attract serious disagreement. Take this as on man's opinion and nothing else.
It is my contention that in modern times corporatized capital has done absolutely nothing good for our society. I understand that they had a time and a place to exist. Today, there's far more evidence of the damage they cause than the positive effects they may have been intended to produce.<p>Corporations create a false economy. One where people are paid exorbitant amounts of money for work that could be done for less in an open market. Corporations also create stagnation both in terms of innovation and of human capital. Corporate shareholders exist in an isolated cocoon where there is no need to excel or evolve past your station. Corporations damage competitiveness at a national and international level. Corporations damage the economy and destroy industries by creating contracts with unreasonable terms, benefits and pensions. Corporations in government create a nasty conflict-of-interest situation where hordes of shareholders contribute as a unified block supporting the very laws and politicians that regulate their own companies (oversee your own pollution, legal compliance, etc.). Corporations also use this vote-by-dollar approach to influence politics and the politicians that want their cash.<p>It is my opinion that corporate managers and shareholders, as individuals, are generally good hard-working people. However, once their thoughts and actions are controlled by the need to support their ""team"" (the corporation) the collective can, and often becomes, evil in many ways. Case in point: HP had a contract clause that caused Carly Fiorina to get paid tens of millions of dollars just for getting fired. She earned tens of thousands of times the average worker's salary to actively damage the business. The Chinese have got to be laughing their asses off when they see us self-destruct this way.<p>Fossil fuel companies are yet another example. The list of evils is too long to list here. The most basic one is the inability to tax them for emitting pollution that threatens to criminally kill millions.<p>We would be able to move at a very different pace if corporations went away. I won't hold my breath.",1337744766

This is so that if something prevents your app from building the remote repo doesn't get corrupted by a bad push. Your post-commit hooks on your development repo will continue to work as normal.<p>At the moment the only additional hook that Dokuen supports is after-build, before app startup. You set it by setting the DOKUEN_AFTER_BUILD environment variable to a command that you want to run. For example, I have one of my apps set to run ""rake db:migrate"" here.",1337742761
4011338,comment,4008733,4011144,2,0,tikhonj,,,"Take my advice with a grain of salt because I'm still a student, but I'd join the company. You don't really need large amounts of money just after graduating, and besides, most people in other majors probably end up making even less. On the other hand, working for a small startup would probably be more interesting and exciting, especially if you like the founders. Then, if it doesn't pan out, you would probably have no problem finding a job at a bigger company for a sufficiently high salary. So maybe you'd make less money overall in the event of a the biotech company's failure, but you'd still have enough to not worry and a more interesting experience.<p>Also, your risk tolerance as a fresh grad is much higher than it will be in the future. You (probably) don't have an expensive lifestyle or a family, and you can live pretty cheaply yourself. So you have much less reason to be leery of equity than somebody older and more established.<p>I personally think that the best time to work for a small startup is just after graduating, and that it's definitely worth doing at some point in your life.  So I would go for it in your position.",1337742745

While I'm sure it'll get around to that eventually, I think the realization of a scifi-like fantasy might be distracting people from a more obvious, practical reason for Google to be doing this.<p>Sebastian Thrun co-developed Street View. You know, with all those cars driving around gathering information about meatspace? One might say... <i>crawling</i> meatspace? Thrun is also a major force behind the driverless car project.

7460457,comment,7453513,7454197,1,0,sigil,,,"Sure, arbitration requires a trusted third party. Look though, the situation is a huge improvement over what we currently have:<p>1. Arbitration services can be decoupled from payment services. With multisig, buyer and seller get to <i>choose</i> an arbiter they trust based on reputation, jurisdiction, experience arbitrating similar kinds of transactions, etc. This is an unbundling of what credit card companies do today and opens up an entirely new and competitive market. As your scenario shows, reputation will be everything for these new companies. Evidence of foul play will be disastrous. However, in the less-than-competitive market of bundled payment and arbitration services we have today, evidence of foul play in arbitration doesn&#x27;t even seem to make a dent (consider PayPal).<p>2. Which brings up another point: arbitration with multisig is safer for buyer and seller. In their dual role as arbiter, PayPal can and does freeze funds in transit indefinitely. A Bitcoin 2-of-3 multisig arbiter <i>cannot</i> do this if both buyer and seller agree there was no problem. The arbiter is simply outvoted.<p>3. The flip side of that is: arbiters don&#x27;t have to get involved at all in the vast majority of transactions that aren&#x27;t disputed. They don&#x27;t have to process payments. They don&#x27;t have to transfer money. They don&#x27;t need all that infrastructure. They only get involved in settling disputes, in which case they cast their vote by signing the transaction to the buyer or seller. This should make arbitration services cheaper and more efficient on the whole.<p>4. Finally, unlike current payment systems, Bitcoin makes arbitration services optional. Whole classes of transactions suddenly become cheaper because of this. In the current system we&#x27;re paying for arbitration services we don&#x27;t even need. I&#x27;m not going to dispute that $3 charge for a cup of coffee. If you&#x27;re friends and family making a larger payment to me, I don&#x27;t need arbitration either.<p>Like Eli Dourado, I also think we&#x27;re on the verge of some very interesting things happening in arbitration:<p>&quot;What excites me most about the decentralized arbitration afforded by multisignature transactions is that it could be the beginnings of a Common Law for the Internet. The plain, ordinary Common Law developed as the result of competing courts that issued opinions basically as advertisements of how fair and impartial they were. We could see something similar with Bitcoin arbitration. If arbitrators sign their transactions with links to and a cryptographic hash of a PDF that explains why they ruled as they did, we could see real competition in the articulation of rules.&quot;<p><a href=""http://elidourado.com/blog/bitcoin-arbitration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elidourado.com/blog/bitcoin-arbitration/</a>",1395687242

Rejection hurts. However, often you can aim for criticism that says, &quot;I&#x27;ll merge this if you fix X, Y, and Z&quot;.<p>Treat a PR as a request for feedback on your code.  Perhaps the project prefers a certain style, or the maintainers might know of ways you can write your code in a more idiomatic manner for that language.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of this!  This is one of the ways we get better. Expect to have several comments that are &quot;please-fix&quot; style comments.<p>Start small, and try to resolve an issue that&#x27;s already reported. Ask a maintainer if there&#x27;s a small enough task that they&#x27;d be willing to delegate to you.  If they already know you&#x27;re working on something, you are likely to get a warmer reception, and you avoid them having the same feature already under development.<p>When you finish implementing your feature (or fix), spend some time writing a few paragraphs of prose describing what your PR changes, what problems it fixes, as well as any assumptions you made or limitations that it might have and any future changes that this might need.<p><pre><code>  e.g.:\n  This changes the way we fetch Foo and Bar lists\n  of items for users so that they use the same RPC \n  method.

Any loop can be rewritten as a tailrec function and I prefer tailrec functions because it&#x27;s easier to me to guard against invariants changing or to reason about branches or exit conditions. Plus with algebraic data-types, the compiler can warn you that you missed a branch. Etc... Also, the compiler does optimize plain for-loops on ranges. You can even have a macro that rewrites your nice looking for loop into a while expression.<p>On mutually recursive tail calls, yes, the runtime doesn&#x27;t have support.

Now this is a long time ago, and I only saw the clip once, but what I recall is that shortly after launch, rather than a clean arc, one missile seemed to describe some crazy set of mid-air loops (which I immediately interpreted as a software error) before what seemed to be a sudden dive into the ground. The voice-over didn&#x27;t refer to this apparent failure directly, but you could sense a certain awkwardness. Have you ever heard of any incident matching this?<p>The second: as you&#x27;ll know, the Patriot wasn&#x27;t designed for a direct hit on incoming missiles, but was intended to get within a critical radius and then explode, triggering an explosion in the incoming missile&#x27;s warhead. My friend theorised that the Iraqis exploited this by repeatedly launching missiles without payloads, so that even successfully exploding Patriots had little effect other than to deplete the military budget by X hundred thousand bucks a throw.<p>Do either of these sound familiar or plausible? Things that I&#x27;ve wondered about for years!",1395686530
7460346,comment,7458812,7459642,6,0,fosterku,,,"I think that is why systems try to hit the missile on the way up before RV separation. The navy has Missile Systems, such as the TBMD section of the Aegis weapons system, that uses US/ship based SM-3 missiles to hit a Ballistic missile on it&#x27;s ascent. However, this means you have to detect the BM early and launch your missiles from somewhere in the ocean so that you could hit the target around it&#x27;s apex. They do this by sharing radar data between land and ship based radars, getting the SM-3 close to target, and then using a kinetic warhead to make contact with the BM.<p>I would think that the patriot missile system uses a similar theory. It probably use a radar to detect the scud launch and then calculate the correct time to deploy a missile for intercept. The patriot would either be flown close to the scud using telemetry based systems on the patriot, or by using mid course/terminal guidance from the patriot launcher. Terminal guidance would fly the missile in front of the scud and &quot;patriot go boom&quot;. If the terminal guidance is slightly off, you don&#x27;t go boom in front of the scud and the scud hits it target.<p>In some fire control radars, the terminal guidance is constructed of data the radar receives from a missile downlink, where the missile reports it&#x27;s position to the launcher in order to use a more precise radar on the ground to direct the missiles path towards a target. I think it&#x27;s more popular to use a combination of missile communications uplink/downlink and combine it with Ground based radar data, to determine where the missile is, where the target is, and where the expected point of missile intercept should be.",1395686529

I&#x27;ve used a Lenovo X200 for a few years and been immensely happy with it, but it was starting to show its age and the display was becoming less and less bright. The recent Thinkpads are utter crap, IMHO. Give me some fucking mouse buttons instead of going the Apple route and hiding them underneath the touchpad. The &#x27;clit&#x27; is still there, but it&#x27;s almost unusable. The resolution is too low.<p>I initially bought a T440, but it died in BIOS on second boot, and after 2 motherboard changes and 1.5 months in Lenovo&#x27;s own lab they were still unable to even put in the serial numbers (needed for the Windows license that came with it). In the end, and after much delay, the gave me a new one. I promptly gave it to an employee running Windows instead of even trying.<p>For my new, new laptop I chose a Dell XPS 13 (9333) Developer Edition. No Microsoft tax! I&#x27;m not an Ubuntu person, so I ditched the pre-installed (though not after booting it up and noticing that Dell wanted me to sign some EULA before continuing on to the desktop).<p>Instead I went with Debian. The monitor shows up as &quot;Synaptics Large Touch Screen&quot;. Bluetooth and wireless works after installing non-free drivers. Suspend and resume works. It&#x27;s fast.<p>There are only two problems. One is the irritating coil whine that the series exhibit. Sometimes it&#x27;s there, sometimes it&#x27;s not. Usually I can remove it by toggling the keyboard backlight, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter if it&#x27;s from on to off or the other way around.  The second, and somewhat worse, is that keys seem to get stuck. Sometimes, and I haven&#x27;t actually found out the cause, the keys seem to get stuck and repeat until another key is pressed. It happened in emacs a few days ago and was almost catastrophic (I do keep my backups, but still..).<p>The last issue is with Dell rather than the computer. It seems weird to offer a Developer Edition with decent drivers and a pre-installed Ubuntu, and then only offer their BIOS upgrades as a Windows and a DOS executable. I used a USB stick with FreeDOS to apply the update, but seriously, why couldn&#x27;t they just give me a utility that works? My little sister, my wife and my mother-in-law all run Linux, and they&#x27;d probably be able to work a simple program that had a one-click BIOS upgrade button. Boot FreeDOS with Grub, apply the update, reboot. Why do I have to do this by myself?",1395686378

Most people, even those who take a more traditional view on marriage, don&#x27;t concern themselves with such things to that extent.<p>However, it is not as bigoted as say, funding a measure against protecting gays from workplace discrimination. Marriage has a long history in our society as being between a man and a woman to provide a legal and social framework for raising biological children (generally speaking). They receive privileges in return for doing something socially beneficial. You could argue that gay marriages generally don&#x27;t do the same and that it&#x27;s not worth re-engineering society to make that change. Marriage is also heavily intertwined with our Judeo-Christian background as a country, so people feel as if changing the term violates their religious rights. The government really shouldn&#x27;t be involved with religion, but people still feel this way nonetheless.<p>Personally I see no trouble in letting two people who love one another and want to form a family unit from marrying. It&#x27;s their own business.<p>I do see a problem with trying to blacklist or shout down people who have political views that aren&#x27;t socially acceptable. People who are against things like unchecked immigration or affirmative action are often tarred as bigots. Abortion is considered a human rights issue by people on both sides of the debate.

One of my tasks is something we called Diminishing Material Sources (DMS).  Basically, we had a system that would be produced over the course of 10 years and would need to be supported for a minimum 20 years after it was produced.  The design, of course, had to be complete before production started, so tack 7 years on to the front.  Not every supplier would want to keep producing specific parts long enough to support our needs, so if something was going to drop out of production I had to perform a DMS analysis to find a substitute.  That involved either finding a drop-in replacement or redesigning part of the circuit.  The former was sometimes painful, because a new supplier would need to have its parts evaluated for compatibility, which meant dozens of hours of testing parts and testing boards with parts installed.<p>The latter was an order of magnitude more painful.  Any change to the design meant a partial or full re-qualification, and the cost could be anywhere from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of dollars.  Anything that involved changing the circuit board automatically went to the right side of that scale.  The &quot;simple certification process&quot; involves intensive environmental stress and screening testing: thermal shock on assembled boards (-40C to 70C transition in 30s); operational thermal cycling (repeated cycles of -40C to 70C with the hardware operating); and operational vibration testing (several tens of minutes operating while attached to a table shaking violently enough to liquefy your internal organs).  There is also accelerated life testing, which determines if the modified design will meet the system longevity requirements.  Depending on what changed and the system complexity, this may have to be repeated at multiple subsystem levels above the affected board.<p>For this reason we bent over backwards not to change the design unless we had no other choice.  Design changes brought too much risk for us, our customers, and our end users.  For this reason the military much prefers the spiral upgrade process for maintaining long-lived systems: once you get some practical experience with the current version, start work on an upgrade package that contains multiple fixes and enhancements at once and switch to that when it is ready.

The people I know who don&#x27;t support gay marriage have no problem with homosexuality or homosexual people (that is, they have no problem with people identifying as gay nor having gay sex), they just believe that allowing gay marriage would be redefining &quot;marriage&quot;. (Which I believe is a bigoted opinion, but I am sympathetic to their ignorance and fear.)<p>I don&#x27;t believe this is sampling bias on my part; in fact, I thought that was <i>exactly</i> the position on gay marriage taken up by <i>both</i> Obama and McCain in 2008, I specifically remember there was some debate or joint interview or something where Obama opened by strongly asserting that gay people deserve all the same rights, and McCain opened by strongly asserting that he doesn&#x27;t believe in &quot;redefining marriage&quot;, and they proceed to find that they completely agree with each other.",1395686186

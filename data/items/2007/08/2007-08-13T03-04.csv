I don't go to the same restaurant in my neighborhood each time - I mix them up. People don't necessarily want the same coffee every day.<p>Because there are coffee customers in the neighborhood that aren't already yours, you have an audience for your specials and sales that is relatively easy to reach. People won't go five blocks out of their way for a one-day, 20% off sale on bagels, but they might go five feet.<p>Starbucks marketing is so much more effective than yours that they will attract customers that you never could. Once they're in the neighborhood, these customers are much more likely to come and taste your coffee - after all, if your coffee sucks, they can always spit it out and go back over to Starbucks. If your coffee doesn't suck, some of those customers will become regulars. <i>Many people</i> prefer local shops over chains... if the effort to switch is low, and if you make it easy to switch back.<p>I remember reading that this is why specialty shops often tend to cluster in specific districts of a city. You would intuitively think that the best spot to open a new store is an underserved location far from existing shops . But, in fact,  you're often better off opening a store one block away from your competitor, where there's some pre-existing traffic that is happy to do some comparison shopping. I once talked to a computer store operator who had deliberately set up shop across the parking lot from a new Micro Center, and he told me the same thing.

41828,comment,41815,41815,0,0,blored,,,"<i>If you have the time, this is the most inspiration story I've read this week...</i><p><p><p><p>At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learning-disabled children, the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended. After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a question: ""When not interfered  with by outside influences, everything nature does is done with perfection.  Yet my son, Shay, cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot  understand things as other children do. Where is the natural order of things in my son?""<p>The audience was stilled by the query.<p>The father continued. ""I believe that when a child like Shay, physically and  mentally handicapped comes into the world, an opportunity to realize true  human nature presents itself, and it comes in the way other people treat that  child.""<p>Then he told the following story:<p>Shay and his father  had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay  asked, ""Do you think they'll let me play?""  Shay's father knew that most  of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but the father  also understood that if his son were allowed to play, it would give him a  much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be accepted by others in  spite of his handicaps.<p>Shay's father approached one of the boys on the field and asked (not expecting much) if Shay could play. The boy looked  around for guidance and said, ""We're losing by six runs and the game is in the  eighth inning. I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to  bat in the ninth inning.""<p>Shay struggled over to the team's bench and,  with a broad smile, put on a team shirt. His Father watched with a small tear in his eye and warmth in his heart. The boys saw the father's joy at his son  being accepted. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few  runs but was still behind by three. In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the right field. Even though no hits came his way, he  was obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands. In the bottom of the  ninth inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, with two outs and the bases  loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.<p>At  this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the  game? Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all  but impossible because Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly,  much less connect with the ball.<p>However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher, recognizing that the other team was putting winning aside  for this moment in Shay's life, moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least make contact. The first pitch came and Shay swung  clumsily and missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the  ball softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit  a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher.<p>The game would now be over. The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the  ball to the first baseman. Shay would have been out and that would have been  the end of the game.<p>Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the  first baseman's head, out of reach of all team mates. Everyone from the stands  and both teams started yelling, ""Shay, run to first! Run to first!"" Never in  his life had Shay ever run that far, but he made it to first base. He  scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled.<p>Everyone yelled,  ""Run to second, run to second!"" Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and struggling to make it to the base. By the time  Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had the ball ... the  smallest guy on their team who now had his first chance to be the hero for his  team. He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions so he, too, intentionally threw the ball  high and far over the third-baseman's head. Shay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners ahead of him circled the bases toward home.  <p>All were screaming, ""Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay""<p>Shay  reached third base because the opposing shortstop ran to help him by turning  him in the direction of third base, and shouted, ""Run to third! Shay, run to third!""<p>As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams, and the  spectators, were on their feet screaming, ""Shay, run home! Run home!"" Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the grand  slam and won the game for his team.<p>""That day"", said the father softly  with tears now rolling down his face, ""the boys from both teams helped bring a  piece of true love and humanity into this world"".<p>Shay didn't make it  to another summer. He died that winter, having never forgotten being the hero and making his father so happy, and coming home and seeing his Mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the day!  ",1186974855

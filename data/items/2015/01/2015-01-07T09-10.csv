That turns out not to be the case.  It once was true, but as the community has grown, so people have not been enculturated with those early ideas and principles, and now many times people read something, disagree, downvote, and move on, without ever providing counter-points, or engaging in the discussion.  It&#x27;s a way to punish people you don&#x27;t agree with, while avoiding having to think.<p>Elsewhere[0] you commented about an item reappearing and having its votes ages apparently reset.  I hazard a guess that it was the mods playing with a mechanism to prevent &quot;item overload.&quot;  There were about a dozen submissions of the SpaceX launch, and each would fall a little way, the next would be submittted, gain a few votes and comments, then fall away to be replaced by another.  One way of preventing the splitting of conversation might be to pick a canonical submission, and then prevent it from falling too far, and thus encouraging conversation only to happen in one place.  Pure speculation, but it would be a mechanism I would consider were I running a site like this.  Certainly there have been fewer instances lately of the &quot;new&quot; page being overrun by breaking news that everyone wants to submit.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8844078"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8844078</a>",1420624459

It takes a skilled marketer and there is always risk, but the potential are also large.<p>If I already watch somebody like the professional chef, their opinions of various related brands (such as flour) may also be valuable. I don&#x27;t have to <i>like</i> their opinion - they just have to have a consistent-enough history[1].

But having to run all that interpreted code in the background is probably not making the engine leaner and faster. I am sure it would be much more efficient to declare your intent in html and having the native renderer handling it. And certainly a lot less verbose and subject to bugs.<p>Say you add to the input tag a validation attribute with an URL and the browser posts the content of the input box in the background for validation, and give feedback to the user in a standard but customizable way.<p>For auto-completion, same thing, just adding one attribute with a url and a standard feedback.<p>Also an attribute to allocate a change to a css property when clicking on an element, to enable css pop ups.<p>There are probably a dozen more attributes like that and that would pretty much make javascript redundant on 99% of the website without making the HTML syntax much heavier (and overall your page would be lighter, because you don&#x27;t have to write the plumbing every time). And you save having to interpret javascript so it has to be more efficient in term of performance too.<p>One counter example is something like bootstrap, where javascript is used to adapt the formatting to the form factor.

But not everyone knows those.<p>Take me for instance: I know a couple of programming laguages pretty well and know how to do most of the typical awk/sed/grep/... functionality in them by hart. I don&#x27;t do a lot of command line work though, and never came around to learning it properly, so when I do and have to do something like &#x27;move all files if some condition is true&#x27;/&#x27;do x for files containing y&#x27; and so on it&#x27;s always the same struggle - couple of options:<p>- start googling around till solution found using awk/sed/... crawl through sometimes awkward syntax and require multiple dummy runs or on copies od data (not nice if it&#x27;s in the TB ranges) to make sure I don&#x27;t screw something up<p>- once and for all learn the ins and outs of awk/sed/...; not sure if the amount of time I&#x27;d have to spend on it is worth it<p>- start an IDE, write some C++ or C#, enter debugger and fix things on the go until correct. The process is usually <i>way</i> faster than the above one since I know syntax and needed methods by hart<p>- write Python/MsBuild script<p>- use something like pythonpy<p>Usually any of these except the first two seem a better idea in my case. So next time I&#x27;m definitely going to try the last one out.",1420621833

8849513,comment,8849291,8849419,0,0,bemmu,,,"Thanks.<p>I tried launching one site called Pen Japan. But what I realized is that any time I considered putting in some effort to promote Pen Japan, I was better off putting that effort into promoting Candy Japan instead. If I look for bloggers to reach out to or write guest posts, I can&#x27;t justify doing it for the new site when I would much rather promote the existing one.<p>Why would I prefer promoting existing one? Two reasons: running two sites is almost twice the work. Why launch a new site and promote that, when I could instead push the existing site? Secondly, there are some minor scale benefits when shipping a lot of the same item. You can get a better margin when buying 1000 pieces of the same item vs. 500 pieces of two different items. So it makes sense to push hard on just one direction.<p>If the sites were somehow less related, but with some synergy benefits, then that would make sense. For example if I launched a buy-and-ship reshipping service where customers can request any item they want from Japan which I then go out to buy and ship to them. It would make sense to promote that, because the avenues to promote it would be different enough not to compete against Candy Japan. It would also make sense in that those services could be cross-sold, so that is something I might consider. But not really wanting to start a &quot;Candy X&quot; where X is just some other country.",1420621208

1199017,comment,1198815,1198815,0,0,brownegg,,,"I am a professional trader, and by almost any definition I operate in the ""high frequency"" space.  First, let's establish that Traders is an authority on the real world of financial markets in the same sense that PC World is an authority in the world of technology.<p>So I've not read the linked article, nor am I going to.  But I will say this: HFT does perform a viable, necessary economic function.  A well-functioning capital market absolutely requires this kind of activity.<p>HOWEVER, like most mainstream-media memes, what gets talked about / opined on is almost never relevant to what is actually important and/or controversial: in this case, the question of whether HFT creates a two-tiered playing field where individual (read: non-technically-sophisticated) investors suffer at the hands of the ""pros"".<p>Most arguments against HFT basically say that algorithms are purely predatory and only serve to hurt the performance of large investors.  This is naive at best and deceptive at worst; for every share I purchase ""ahead of"" a big order, a seller has been filled at the price he desired.  Every transaction has two sides; you can't just pick one and say they got screwed.  The other side has to have done as well as the other did poorly (assuming a fictional frictionless world).<p>The reality is that HFT requires tons of knowledge and a technology budget of seven figures per annum <i>at the barest minimum</i>, and this provides a very real barrier to entry.  What should be talked about, but never is: is that ok?  Why or why not?  What ramifications does it have?",1268845119
1199015,comment,1198924,1198984,0,0,sandal,,,"It is exactly what was used to generate the print book, just with some web enabled features like links.  And yes, this is the PDF you'd get if you buy it from O'Reilly.<p>Marketing-wise, it was a gamble, because the open source release date wasn't contingent on sales or anything like that.  We launched the book and gave a 9 month exclusive rights period to O'Reilly.<p>This at least takes into account the fact that most books sell the majority of their copies in the first month or two, but I didn't have like a minimum sales number before I could open source the book or anything like that.  In fact, the print book says right in the front cover that it'd be open sourced in March.<p>The book did okay sales wise, not great, but not horrible.  It definitely did worse than it should given that (at least from the looks of it) people really, really like it.  But this isn't really up to the readers, it's up to the distributor.  Basically, much of our sales come from wholesale, and with paper book stores on the decline, and the saturation of the market with Ruby books over the last couple years, it was hard to convince them to pick up a lot of copies of the book.<p>As of right now, I am just about at the point of clearing my advance.  I will share specific numbers at some point, but let's just say that the advance probably works out to minimum wage or less when compared to the amount of effort put in.<p>Interestingly enough, the gradual week by week release of chapters really led to a nice spike in sales, coming from what was essentially a steady decline except for a spike around the holidays.  So actually, I think open sourcing the book was good for sales in that regard.  Since it might be hard to find the book on the shelves in a book store, this gives people a chance to ""try before they buy"".<p>Unfortunately, because my book was selling above average as an ebook, I've probably effectively killed those sales today.  Then again, maybe people will still buy the Kindle and Iphone editions, who knows.<p>At the end of the day, I think neither O'Reilly nor myself expected this book to be a big bread winner.  I love the book because it embodies the most interesting things I've learned from the smartest people I know, and I think that comes through in the writing.  I wrote the book because the idea popped into my head fully formed and demanded to be put out on paper.  So that was my biggest win.<p>But from an authors perspective, RBP has given me a great boost in exposure.  I already had name recognition in the inner circles of Ruby community, but after writing the book, I find more opportunities from folks I probably wouldn't have been able to reach otherwise.  This has been good for my open source projects, and good for my work.<p>I'm glad I did this, and it worked out well.  I'd recommend it to others, for sure.  Of course, buying the book will make O'Reilly happy, so go ahead and do that if you want :)",1268845068

For example: ""High frequency traders can only trade profitably when their trades push a stock price towards fair value.""<p>I don't see why there's any particular reason that's true. High-frequency traders can trade profitably whenever their trades are in line with (very) short-term price movements. Ideally everything works together to push prices towards fair value, but you can't assume that as an axiom, since that's the main point being disputed in that section (the one on volatility).",1268844901

1199000,comment,1198815,1198815,0,0,barrkel,,,"I am somewhat confused by this double-negative: ""No serious market observer disputes the claim that volatility would not be higher without the liquidity provided by high frequency traders.""<p>The author seems to be trying to say that high frequency traders reduce volatility. But I parse the claim differently: it seems to me to be saying that volatility could only be lower in the absence of liquidity from high frequency traders.<p>As to the rest of the argument, it seems to be structured along these lines:<p>* More efficient markets with lower spreads between buy and sell are good. I think this is a valid claim, but I don't think it follows from the existence of high frequency trading, but rather from more efficient, automated trading systems.<p>* High frequency trading helps supply market liquidity, and this liquidity is good. I can buy the first part of this, and the second part seems mostly true.<p>* Old-fashioned purchasers seem to be annoyed that when they make a large purchase, the price for the last share is higher than the price for the first share, because the market has already reacted to the change in supply and demand. He also makes the argument that were this not so, the sellers of shares would in effect be subsidizing purchasers. His case seems solid enough to me.<p>* But he then makes another claim that seems to contradict it. He suggests that companies with stocks that have low volume turnover are unduly affected by small purchases, and since high frequency trading increases volume, the impact is reduced.<p>* Finally, it seems he would like to claim that because ""our nation's equity markets are far fairer, more efficient, more liquid and have lower transaction costs for investors than ever before"", high frequency trading should claim a substantial portion of the credit.",1268844615

SQL in particular tends to force a stovepipe approach, because if you try to hide too much complexity behind nice PL/SQL interfaces, you tend to get highly suboptimal explain plans, and/or, you end up losing advantages of multi-block I/O and batch processing. So, instead, you have huge multi-table joins that are inherently brittle and difficult to maintain but which perform adequately.

I think you're right on track that prevention and screening is our weapon against these things.  Screening and prevention costs way less than ""the cure"".<p>If you read Christensen's latest book ""Innovator's Prescription"" he analyzes the medical industry through the lens of disruptive technology, and concludes that the forces of disruptive technology have been dismantled which keep prices high.  The is such a unique perspective in this health care debate because it's basically been framed as ""You pay the high price"", or the ""Government pays the high price"".  However, Christensen is giving us a third option saying fix the economic engine and disruptive technology will drive prices down over time and things will get better  too.  Neither side of the debate can guarantee this either.<p>His idea is that Doctor's cost a lot of money, but when you have to have the very best analyze what's wrong with you have to pay it.  Doctor's jobs are very hard and time consuming.  However, certain types of care can be provided without a doctor for things that are well defined.  Prevention is just such a thing.  Screenings are just such a thing.<p>The problem right now is that technologies that enable us to screen better are often wrapped up so that you can only go to a doctor to get them.  Things like MRI's and CAT scans require prescriptions from doctors.  The price of a CAT scan has remained the same since it was invented.  1970 technology the same price!?  Where else in our free markets does this happen?<p>Prevention is more easy to provide without having to tackle the prescription system, but screenings are very important part of medicine in the 21st century.",1268844451

1198986,comment,1198815,1198933,0,0,sparky,,,"The argument is essentially:\n1) High-frequency traders (HFTs) increase liquidity.  For the benefit of those who don't know what that means: there are actually a finite amount of shares of each company, and you cannot buy shares unless someone is willing to sell theirs to you, and you cannot sell shares unless someone is willing to buy them from you.  You can imagine that you might not be able to sell your shares the instant you want them to if humans are in the loop on the buyer side (i.e., if a human has to review your selling price and decide whether or not to buy), and vice-versa.  In contrast, if somebody has programmed a computer to automatically execute trades if certain conditions are met, you can buy and sell shares very quickly.  This is what HFTs do.<p>2) HFTs provide transparent price discovery.  This means that the computer programs the HFTs have set up will quickly and unambiguously tell you at what price they are willing to buy and sell shares.  Contrast this with a hypothetical process in which you had to haggle with human representatives of each shareholder or potential buyer in order to figure out the price.  It's similar to consumer vs. enterprise software sales (sticker price vs. ""well, how much can you afford?"").  In theory, transparent price discovery promotes fairness (everyone sees the same price) and encourages trading due to decreased latency and hassle.<p>3) Lots of repetition of 1 and 2.  Also an assertion that HFT decreases volatility (average dPrice/dt), while most commentary on the matter assumes that it would increase volatility, due to algorithms that are either busted ( e.g., <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/01/how-a-stray-mouse-click-choked-the-nyse-cost-a-bank-150k.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/01/how-a-stray-mou...</a>) or interacting with one another in a bad way.  It is disconcerting to me that the author cites empirical evidence without a hint of intuition or insight to help the reader generalize it; however, it is difficult to dismiss the evidence off-hand without looking at it more closely and/or being more expert than I in the matter.<p>Points 1 and 2 are by far the most common and obvious arguments for HFT, and the analysis in TFA is not bad, but not exemplary either.  The rest of the article is basically redundant and comes off a little defensive.  I found this article interesting ( <a href=""http://www.zerohedge.com/article/whoa-glitch-hft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zerohedge.com/article/whoa-glitch-hft</a> ), though its tone is also less-than-objective.",1268844385

Paper: <a href=""http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/docs/peg.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/docs/peg.pdf</a><p>It's for Lua, but there isn't anything in the VM design that requires Lua per se - porting it to another language's C API wouldn't be difficult. In my experience, LPEG has been quite easy to use for the sort of tasks one would normally apply regular expressions to (and then some, as it handles recursive structures far better), it's quite fast, and it's easy to tune incrementally. In my (not yet ready for release) Lua/LPEG webserver, I'm handling 1000+ requests per second in about 2MB ram total* , so LPEG's design has tamed the usual space issues caused by PEG memoization.<p>* Only a tiny amount of that time is due to request parsing, it's mostly because I'm still working the kinks out of the event loop.<p>One strike against it is that there isn't a whole lot of casual documentation, though the documentation that does exist (the research paper and a library reference) is quite thorough. Also, it takes advantage of Lua's operator overloading to make the grammars concise, which takes getting used to. Still, having it so thoroughly integrated into the language is extremely convenient, and it's quite a bit more expressive than regular expressions.<p>Also, here's a link to the PEG paper on the author's site, rather than behind the ACM's paywall: <a href=""http://www.bford.info/pub/lang/peg.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bford.info/pub/lang/peg.pdf</a> .

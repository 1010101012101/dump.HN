You need something on your wall, but posters are for college kids, so why not some books?<p>I have a shelfful of books.  I maybe read one of them every few months or so.  But mostly, it is a list of books that I've read that takes up a significant part of my flat.

You could go so far as to say, ""pointless"".<p>e-books are much better -- when you are done reading them, they become a line on a display that you don't have to dust, find storage for, or pack when you move.

They hired me on and when I said I wanted to work as a contractor they were fine with it. I have to say it's a fantastic setup--if you get the chance to become self-employed, take it. The best part is never feeling guilty about being out of the office or taking off for extended periods.. in fact I've probably taken about 8 weeks of vacation so this year. Of course the downside is that vacation = unpaid leave but I find that the time is worth so much more than the money to me right now.<p>My job is kinda specialized, it has to do more with statistical programming and mathematical modeling than the coding that most people on HN do, so I guess that helps when it comes to trying to go it alone. To the extent that I'm qualified to dispense advice it would be to develop a specialized skill that your average competent hacker doesn't have, particularly if it involves a lot of math--a lot of good coders I come across know surprisingly little math.

751968,comment,751694,751694,0,0,yannis,,,"One of my own 'AHA' moments was when I discovered that you can't. Yes you can never take control over your life. You need to relax and go with the flow. We all think that we are controlling our lives, but consider this, suppose time is a river and your life can be represented by you sitting on a small boat. You can puddle a bit and control a little bit of where you are (akin for example to choosing a career or job).<p>However, the flow of the river determines the overall direction! Now, for the interesting part. Now and then other people get on your boat. A girlfriend, a child a wife! As you go along the river, people come and go.<p>Another interesting part is what I call 'crossroads', they also appear almost randomly. Situations where a 'do this' or 'do that' can influence the journey. You will probably get about four in life. Most of the times when this happens you will not know is happening. For example you went on holiday to Costa Rica and ended up meeting a girl in the Airplane, should you eventually marry this girl it can influence the rest of your life.<p>Money and success can give you a temporary dejavu of control. You can have a great business, you control your time, your health is tops and out of nowhere your boat hits a rock, or somebody came in the boat and drilled a hole.<p>This is advice from a 'baby boom hacker' they exist on HN too! :). Married same day as Charles and Diana! So far the score is on my side! Had a lot of bumpy rides, married three times, 5 kids, a number of businesses, went bust twice, lived through two wars (Cyprus and Gulf), lived through the bad years in South Africa, worked in five countries.<p>Control?

Even if they don't get read and/or don't reflect your current life, books on a shelf are still telling a story <i>about</i> <i>you</i> in a way that DVDs you own can't. I feel that a single book by itself that someone owns is not particularly interesting but the larger hodge podge or holistic collection of books that it belongs to is <i>interesting</i>. For example, my friend Simon and his wife have a collection of travel books in a high-traffic/prominent location (right next to the garage access/front door) (to places they've been and hope to go) - and I feel this is interesting because they have two very young kids and are in no position to travel off.. But perhaps a daily reminder..<p>Books can be good conversation starters/icebreakers. Seriously, if you want to meet someone with a certain type of interest, try starting conversations with people who are hanging out in that area of the bookstore. You can start to learn more about a person from the books they have on their bookshelf. If they have any biographies, I usually ask why they are interested in that person. Sometimes you can even infer what they are hiding from the books they show.<p>Before a party in my apartment, I deliberately randomized the books that were all neatly categorized and alpha by author (like in a bookstore! I own one of those UPC barcode scanners too) to make it appear that I wasn't that OCD. I don't think anyone noticed.<p>I believe physical books are more valuable than digital ones because they are a concrete representation of someone's passion and their investment of time in it. The sentimentality of books as being part of someone's life work is more noticeable if it is decades old and sizable (page-wise) - makes you wonder - who wrote this/why did they write it/who were they.",1249878136

Unfortunately, not at my initiative.<p>I am hoping that this is the time when I take control.  Better late than never.<p>(In some ways, I've always taken control.  In never being satisfied with the -- usually inefficient and boring and mistake-laden -- status quo.  However, trying to introduce changes from the bottom up, or even just follow your own road, has limited effectiveness in some organizations.<p>That's just the way they are.

It's very hard to get Comet to work reliably on all browsers across all types of firewalls and proxy servers.<p>I did a prototype of something using the library that powers GTalk, Google Docs, and now Wave.  Even with the library all pre-built for me, it was pretty hard to keep it from occasionally dropping connections and associated messages, and once in a while it'd lock up my browser (much like GMail and Docs do, occasionally. ;-)).  I also peeked under the covers, and there's a lot of subtlety in what's going on.<p>Comet is best for when you have stuff that <i>really</i> needs to be real-time.  Things like stock quotes, or chat.  IIRC, everything in Civilization is done in response to user input.  AJAX is fine for that.",1249877034

326305,story,,,3,0,railsnoob,"Help meeee BackgroundRB is killing me",,"Anyone has a clue on how I can  solve this...<p>1) We are starting asynchronous Worker threads using the BachgroundRb Server from our Rails App. What is the right way for the Rails application to be notified that the Worker thread has completed (preferably without having to check status periodically with the Worker).<p>2) Once we have determined that the Worker has completed its work, what is the right way to delete the Worker thread? Is it BackgroundRb::Connection.delete_worker?<p>We are currently using the BackGroundRb::Connection.new_worker method to instantiate workers and have tried ask_result and register_status to get status from the worker, and neither of them seem to work!",1223433913

I haven't heard many (any) stumbleupon advertising success stories. Anyone know of case studies.<p>There's always the chance that a big chunk of that is coming from companies that spend big on ppc/seo with good returns & are looking for any other channel. They could be throwing some money at it to see what happens. They may not come back.<p>Actually, a good sign of potential would be money making sites obsessing about being on Digg's home page or getting 'stumble thunder' like bloggers do.",1223433845

Although it is possible the VPS host is not managing its resources well and its possible Apache is configed poorly, it is just as likely the app itself is a pig and needs lots of cleanup.<p>If you don't have the skill set be a good sysadmin and you ""dont know"" if its your app, you are in for a world of hurt.  I highly suggest you find help: a good sysadmin and maybe an outsider to look at your code and web page structure.  I have not heard enough to say your hosting company is screwing you.  And its maybe wise that you are paying $60/month for better tech support but you still only get $60/month worth of tech support and that's not much ;(.",1223433466

Yes, just making it shareware would fix that.<p>I'd guess they'd want to keep it open source: they could dual license it - but there might be a backlash if buyers find out they could have got it free (ironically...) so perhaps some trivial glossy addition to the shareware version, so there's a sense you're getting <i>something</i> for your money... mail you a USB drive with it installed? (very cool). mail you a printed manual? (old skool) or, maybe include a bunch of glossy templates, by a paid pro graphic artist (I like this, because (a). digital, auto-delivery; (b). not code).<p>I'm assuming they're not in it for the money so it doesn't matter if they only break even (as long as it's not a hassle to provide); it's just a device to promote adoption (as you say).",1223432964

326289,comment,325923,325923,0,0,trevelyan,,,"The story does not seem as clear-cut to me as your post suggests. From reading between the lines it seems that your partner is responsible for some if not most of the coding work, and that you're responsible for other things including financing, community management and possibly marketing.<p>If this is the case you should have no complaints about the money. And if you've been rushing at the project for more than a year and were in desperate crunch mode three months ago, the slow-down in code growth is natural. Products routinely oscillate between new feature development and bug-fixing. It isn't uncommon for the code base to hold constant or shrink as it is tightened up following launch. You should evaluate whether your founder is doing/has done his job by the reliability of the system you have built under the constraints of money/time/effort. If he moved heaven and earth for you 12 weeks ago, you have no right to complain about a little lethargy now that the ball is in your court.<p>Your post does not include any suggestions that the tech side of things has been up-and-down or unreliable, or that your partner has failed to do his job on this front. Merely a complaint about the pace of new feature development. If this is the problem perhaps your co-founder is simply burned out and needs a vacation. The best way to motivate him may be to start hitting home runs yourself.<p>If the company is going into debt and you can't hold up your earlier division of labor/finance, that is a problem for the business. If it were me I'd work to make any new financial obligations shared going forward. This should help motivate your friend to cut his losses if he does not believe in the viability of the business anymore.<p>First and foremost though, you are out of the development crunch and are presumably at the point where you are being expected to deliver results and problems will surface with scalability. You need to be really careful your attitude towards him is not being caused by your own frustrations at how your business is developing, and/or a desire to find a scapegoat for slow growth or underpar performance.",1223431451

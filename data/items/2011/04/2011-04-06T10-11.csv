You can create an absolutely piracy-proof system by installing your software on one computer, and having your customers each take turns flying to and using that computer as if it were some cheap carnival ride... or you can take the alternate approach by investing absolutely nothing in piracy-thwarting measures and relying on the honesty of your users to generate income.<p>What have you found is the best way to balance these factors? To what degree does the honesty and integrity of your market affect these factors? Is it even fair to make assumptions as to their honesty and integrity?<p>What I typically do in programs is provide a single authorization code that unlocks the program. It's something that can easily be cracked, but I do auth checks in pretty obscure areas of the program; it'd take at least an hour or two for a pro to crack.

2414563,comment,2414496,2414555,18,0,JonnieCache,,,"True, but this would imply that the plaintext password would be passed around the application's internal infrastructure. Instead of just going into the frontend server, being hashed and then discarded, it would have to be passed to the email server, probably via some sort of message queue. This means the plaintext passwords would have to reside in some kind of datastore temporarily, possibly for quite some time if there is a backlog of registration emails.<p>This means you have to encrypt that store, which means you have to decide if you want to force EVERY email sent through the queue to adhere to the same security standards or just registration emails. Then you have to manage the keys for that encryption, and you have to audit it, blah blah blah blah, it quickly adds up to many many man hours of work.<p>All this just makes the whole thing more insecure, it increases the attack surface, and increases the work needed to secure the system and keep it secure. As it is not really necessary, IMO it shouldn't be done.<p>This also includes displaying the password back to the user in the browser, the plaintext password should be gone from memory before the templating engine is even invoked. The best way to solve problems is to simply avoid them.<p>Maybe I'm being unnecessarily paranoid, I like to think of it as a ""security mindset"" :)",1302086340

You can gain entry if you have enough experience to skip the prerequisites. Costs are similar. You could pull it off in 2 years if you worked like a champion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.liv.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught_courses/software-engineering-online-msc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.liv.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught_courses/softw...</a>",1302084953

We make two main ones:<p>* When you register at WordPress.com, we show you your password and email it to you.
* When you log in we tell you whether the username or password was incorrect.<p>The accessibility and increased convenience for users in both cases has been deemed to be worth it.""<p>Edit: I just checked, and it seems that they've changed this element of their policy.

On a trip to Japan he insists on going to an area where there is 'nothing to see' rather than the standard tour, and of course discovers a unique and unspoiled part of the country. But even if he hadn't, he would have considered it a win - in another of his stories, he talks about going to bars and waiting for something interesting to happen, knowing that much of the time nothing of note would occur. That drive to keep experiencing something new, and the understanding that the drive would often lead to nothing, is inspirational to me, and I think is what led Feyman to so many interesting things in so many fields.",1302084789

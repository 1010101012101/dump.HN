He took steps to stop what he thought was the issue.  It was not until the cap was broken a second time that he realized it was his backup system uploading to a 3rd party service.<p>That is not entitlement at all.  If anything it was ignorance of the fact that your upload data is also measured against the cap.<p>I agree with him about going to the FCC.  The fact that he has no where to turn to purchase a competing service means that Comcast can dictate peoples internet usage behavior.  My question would be is does the 250g data cap apply when they are watching TV/Movies online via Comcast (XFinity) provided services?",1310579988

2759829,comment,2759338,2759480,6,0,jsherry,,,"You're defining a pyramid scheme too narrowly.  This is one piece of a pyramid/ponzi scheme, but in those schemes, the underlying asset has no net worth.  Here, Evernote clearly has worth, and plenty of it (regardless of whether the exact figure is debatable).<p>This happens quite often in Series B+ rounds, where previous investors take some or all money off the table.  The reason is that early stage investors don't always have the tolerance/portfolio to sustain a long-term investment.  Let's use DoCoMo Capital in this example since they were an investor in Evernote's Series A/B rounds.  It appears that they didn't invest during this round, so it very well may be the case that they took some of all of their money off the table.  It could very well be the case that DoCoMo Capital (who is the venture arm of NTT DoCoMo) made their initial investment in Evernote as a strategic one.  Perhaps they no longer see strategic value in the company and need to cash out so they can make different investments that are a better strategic fit for their company.  I don't know this to be the case at all - just showing the point.<p>Alternatively, let's say an angel investor with a very small portfolio had invested in Evernote in their very early stages.  It could very well be the case today that 95%+ of that angel's net worth is tied up in the company, and so he/she might want to take some money off the table today to reduce his/her risk.<p>On the other hand, perhaps Sequoia has the tolerance to wait this out until IPO or a mega-acquisition.  So they get in now at a higher price, cash some of the older investors out to reduce some dilution to current shareholders, and then the rest of the cash gets pumped back into the company.<p>Hopefully this is helpful.",1310579598

DH allows two unrelated parties who share no secrets to exchange a secret in public; it's kind of magical. But it's also trivial to man-in-the-middle. To get around that problem, ephemeral Diffie Hellman mode in SSL/TLS signs the DH exchange with the RSA key.<p>The win here is that losing the RSA key now only allows you to MITM future SSL/TLS connections. This is still a disaster, but it does not allow you to retroactively unwind previous DH exchanges and decrypt earlier captured sessions.<p> <i>DH is unbelievably simple; go read the Wikipedia page.</i>",1310577685

And, each person will contribute to molding your culture in very subtle ways.  Yes, you can shape the big things, like corporate vision, etc., but in the end the culture is the sum total of the personalities involved, and it takes on a life of its own.  And, if you try to shape it too much, you'll end up hiring people just like you, and then the real problems will start...<p>Also, as a former Enron employee, as I read through the culture foundations listed by the author, it struck me that these were exactly the culture foundations that CEO Jeff Skilling espoused, especially meritocracy and the survival of the fittest.

Coin cell batteries won't last long playing albums, and are expensive to replace.  The value proposition just isn't there for the end-user except for very limited novelty purposes.<p>However, it might be there for people who essentially want to advertise their real product (perhaps a CD release, perhaps something else).  Sell these at cost or give them away to promote your event or new album?  I can see that.<p>Oh, I see one of the news articles says rechargeable lithium battery.  That's good for short-term usability, bad for cost.  And it puts an absolute limit on the life of the item at about three years, when all lithium batteries die permanently and it won't be replaceable.<p>""Hey kids, look what I found in the attic!

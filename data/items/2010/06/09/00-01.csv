1415754,comment,1414098,1414098,0,0,koeselitz,,,"This article is flatly wrong. Some early Romans may well have used so-called 'Roman numbers,' which retained some common use among the masses throughout the years; but any Roman of real education, particularly a Roman geometer or mathematician, of an era after around 100 BC would've used the more convenient and refined Greek numerals, which were base-10 just like our own, and which were in fact a bit more complex than our numbers in that they used separate characters for the tens and hundreds slots. In fact, the Greek system of numerals predates the Roman by hundreds of years. [See here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals</a>]<p>This belief that Arabic numerals were the first base-ten system of numbers, that our own modern methods are vastly superior to the methods of the past, or that, as the author of this article puts it, ""the Romans did not know anything about the binary system,"" is silly misinformation.

But it is also their platform.<p>Also I was previously under the impression that Google would win taking the 'Windows' route on the mobile market but it is such a different beast.  Apple really is taking the Windows approach in standard phones, common single OS and much more of a solid platform in mobile currently. It may change when phone designs are more commodities and they just looks like the iPhone.<p>Another thing to consider is that Steve Jobs got fired in 1985 when Apple was ahead.  They lost both because Steve Jobs was fired and Bill Gates emerged and Microsoft took advantage of the lamer Apple.  So I am not sure the same situation will happen this time around that happened to desktop in the 90's, maybe once Jobs gets too old.<p>We shall see and it will be interesting. But Apple isn't Apple anymore, they are a morphed NeXTSTEP which was Jobs reboot after he got fired from Apple. Microsoft is done as a challenger most likely and Google seems to be reactive.  Apple is mostly competitive with their last product not the competition as much, where the competition will be following and reactive for some time.<p>I think Apple is 5-10 years ahead currently.  People also ALWAYS overlook the iPod/iPad handheld market that makes up almost 60% of their market.  Noone has even began to tread on that and iTunes.  Now Apple it going after mobile advertising so Google can't grow as fast as they'd like in mobile.<p>Maybe it is inevitable but this time around there are differences.",1276043062

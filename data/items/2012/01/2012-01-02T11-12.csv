3415575,comment,3412891,3415190,0,0,Sandman,,,"I disagree with your point that the verbosity of Java is the reason for over-engineering. The refactoring capabilities of modern-day IDEs help immensely with reducing the amount of work one has to do to make syntactic changes over the whole codebase. So the argument that developers tend to over-engineer when coding in Java to avoid any pains that may arise because of its verbosity doesn't hold, IMO.<p>I think that the over-engineering happens simply because it's a pain to do serious refactoring when working on large enterprise software in general, never mind what language it's written in. The sad truth of our profession is that the customer requirements may change quickly and drastically, requiring us to rewrite large portions of our code, and very often we find ourselves thinking ""If I only engineered it that way instead of this way, I wouldn't have so much trouble right now"". This is why we strive to create the most robust, flexible solution that will be able to handle any future customer requirement.  So we basically turn our code into a framework that, we hope, will allow us to respond to change quickly. Unfortunately, we can never predict <i>everything</i> that the users might want, so this whole approach falls down like a house of cards when a user requirement comes in and we need to change a large portion of the code. I believe this is true for a sufficiently large app written in any language, Haskell included.",1325503956

A weather balloon can get you to the ""edge of space"", yes, but orbit is an entirely different process. To be in orbit, you need a rotational velocity (travelling around the earth) in the order of 7.8 km/s. A weather balloon can't do that! If you were to simply go to space vertically and turn off the engine, you'd simply fall straight back down again - the only reason you can stay in orbit ""indefinitely"" is because your rotational velocity is great enough that you're constantly ""missing"" the earth. (see Newton's canonball - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cannonball"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cannonball</a>)<p>The key issue with getting anything to orbit is the fuel cost. It's expensive, and pretty much impossible to avoid. Micro satellites work by weighing very little and fitting in spaces on the rocket that otherwise would be empty. There's still a fuel cost in doing that (Most chemical rockets have a cost to orbit of at least $10,000 / kg). It's unavoidable.  The existing micro satellites (ie AmSats) have been launched on the generosity of the launching organisation (unlikely to happen with satellites designed to circumvent governments) and have a very high failure rate.<p>It's not impossible, but the project would need serious backing. Even more expensive than paying the cost of launching micro satellites would be actually developing their own launch platform (another suggestion in the article).",1325502754

I always wonder why none of the other programming languages provide a handy COALESCE function/operator out of the box. That way, they wouldn't encourage bug-provoking hacks such as abusing the ""||"" operator.<p>Of course you can always implement your own COALESCE function, but that won't provide the nice short-circuit ability. So this is only feasible in languages with macros (e.g. Lisp), or languages which are lazy-evaluated (e.g. Haskell).<p>All other languages should either provide a COALESCE function/operator, or a sane alternative to ""||"" which skips only NULL values and nothing else.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/functions-conditional.html#FUNCTIONS-COALESCE-NVL-IFNULL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/functions-conditio...</a>",1325502463

Sound familiar?&quot;<p>But then it switches gears and what follows seems more appropriate for a reader who is completely new to programming. &quot;Let me define terms like &#x27;bug&#x27;, &#x27;comment&#x27;, &#x27;function call&#x27; and &#x27;loop&#x27; for you.&quot;<p>(Maybe the actual audience is people who have recently started trying to build web apps (or something of the kind) without learning the fundamentals, and have been barely surviving by copy-and-pasting things? It doesn&#x27;t <i>look</i> like it from the other articles on the blog.)<p>I&#x27;m also not sure what our hypothetical beginner is supposed to do with this little glossary. On its own, it seems to me it has the exact same problem the author described earlier in the context of Angular documentation: you don&#x27;t know what X means, so you look it up, but it&#x27;s defined in terms of Y and Z which you also don&#x27;t know. So you look up Y and it&#x27;s defined in terms of P, Q, and X. Etc.<p>I think this sort of little glossary of basic terms is potentially useful, but only in the context of something -- e.g., perhaps the author&#x27;s book -- that introduces these terms gradually, in an order chosen for ease of learning, and in a context where most of what&#x27;s going on is something other than &quot;here are some definitions to learn&quot;.",1454675726

Auto complete for class names in any used packages is something that I sorely miss from the Sublime plugin I use.<p>- Start-up time still takes a few seconds which means I only use it for projects.<p>- Listing of installed and discovery of packages is _so_ slow. Sometimes I just don&#x27;t bother installing a package anymore because it takes at least 10 seconds to show me what I have installed or search for one.<p>Regardless of me using Atom, I&#x27;m still loving the updates to Sublime and continue to moderate the forums, knowing that Jon will deliver :)",1454674463

It&#x27;s extremely, extremely, extremely bad. You look at the code and you see an army of monkeys happily shitting line after line of spaghetti; you open up database only to see hundreds of tables painfully obviously created by people who might have heard phrase &quot;database normalization&quot;, but never looked it up; you try to make it do other stuff except blogging (e.g. add another language), you end up in horrible pains. But you open up admin and suddenly you understand why it&#x27;s popular. It&#x27;s design is sleek. The end user will never know the horror that lurks underneath it. It has myriads of plugins written by worse hacks than WP core team, but the user will never know that for he has no knowledge. It has seas of free templates (some of which contain dubious php code), but hey, they are free and they look good. And damn it&#x27;s popular and that many people just can&#x27;t be wrong. After all, if you say it&#x27;s bad and should be nuked from orbit just to be sure, it&#x27;s you who&#x27;s wrong - because you haven&#x27;t done any better and that is sufficient grounds for calling you incompetent...\nTL;DR: exploits in wordpress?

Apple isn't selling a product to consumers, they're telling consumers, ""Hey guys, by the way, Apple stuff just got a lot better.  You're going to like the new way it works.  Come check it out.""  iCloud is ""the new way to store and access your content.""<p>Apple knows they're in the business of selling Apple stuff, and iCloud is an improvement to that stuff rather than something separate.  The fact that iCloud is a ""product"" is incidental and only matters to people who are used to thinking in those terms:  stock analysts, MBA school marketers, shareholders, etc.  To consumers, needing another ""product"" to do exactly the same things they've always been doing is a nuisance.  Another complication?  Fuck that.  I like what I've got.  I don't need them ramming another product down my throat.  Apple's on their wavelength:  they just want people to <i>keep using Apple products</i> and they want more people to switch.  This is all about making existing products work better.  Honestly, it would be more attractive to consumers if the this new non-product had no name at all, but Apple had to cater a little bit to all the journalists and analysts and bloggers who need a product name so they can talk about it.  So Apple gave it a name that isn't catchy and only means something to people who follow technology trends.<p>I don't think Microsoft's slowness is just incompetence, though.  There's also an issue of trust.  Microsoft can't just roll out a cloud service and a whole bunch of cloud-enabled software to desktop users and expect them to use it.  Who would trust Microsoft?  Apple is just a company and shouldn't be considered trustworthy from a consumer's point of view, but it is regarded with trust and affection by a large number of users.  Besides, if jack-booted thugs arrived on my doorstep as a result of something I stored in Apple's iCloud, it would probably be the Fashion Police coming to take me to a gulag for frumpy people (which I'm convinced is Apple's intended endgame.)  Not only is Microsoft trusted less by its users, Microsoft wants enterprise customers as much as or more than individual consumers, and the number of businesses who won't trust Microsoft because they see themselves in competition with Microsoft or its business partners (or in violation of Microsoft software licensing terms) is pretty big.  Microsoft needs a more complicated solution with better security and probably a productized cloud storage platform so users can manage their own cloud servers if they don't trust Microsoft.  Apple is concentrating on consumers and has a loyal customer base that is willing to trust them with storage, so it's no wonder they've found it easier to make the jump.",1307720269

That's why Cook's article (referenced on this page) had to be written; people just don't think that way.<p>And even when they do, situations like that in the article are not super common. What we have here is a tree-ish structure in which nodes do computation on their subtrees, and the <i>way</i> in which that computation is done needs to be hidden behind an abstraction barrier. That last is what is forcing the recursion requirement. If it weren't true, then some master function could query all nodes in the tree directly, and an iterative method would work fine.<p>However, if we are in such a situation, then the fact is that Python just doesn't work as well as some other languages. There is no ""way to handle it"".<p>Note, BTW, that TCO is not a complete solution. A function only gets one tail call. If a node needs to query <i>two or more</i> child nodes, then at least one of those calls is not a tail call, and you get stack troubles.

Completely optional but would clean up the language quite a bit. This has been proposed several times and shot down each for no real good reason.<p>- Promote complex primitives into objects. With the proper interfaces it wouldn't break any old code. Once this is done, deprecate the myriad of str* and array* functions in favor of the object methods. This also cleans up the ""what order do i pass in the args"" problem that so many people cite.<p>- Named parameters. Gets rid of passing in default params or an array blob for functions/methods that take lots of optional params. It also opens up the way for DSLs.<p>- Replace PEAR with something better. The quality of PEAR modules is really low and PEAR always seems to be broken one way or another.<p>- Add a list and hash type. PHP's array is very slow for some cases, and sometimes you need to enforce the datatype you're working with.<p>- Use exceptions for errors. Could be a runtime flag to prevent breaking things. It's incredibly easy to write bad code because PHP make it easy to ignore problems. Things like functions that connect to the db or trying to retrieve data from a stream don't throw exceptions on error.",1307718935

For example, here's an estimate of travel costs with boron fusion rockets:\n<a href=""http://nextbigfuture.com/2007/11/fusion-propulsion-if-bussard-iec-fusion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nextbigfuture.com/2007/11/fusion-propulsion-if-bussar...</a><p>If either Bussard's polywell fusion or focus fusion turn out to work, that'll be achievable within a couple decades. As Moore's Law continues and we get better at simulating plasma, it's not that unlikely that some form of fusion will work out.<p>There are a lot of possibilities for non-rocket launch, including various space-elevator-like schemes, laser launch, and mass drivers. Even without fusion, thorium fission could provide plenty of power.<p>It'd be pretty expensive and slow to travel to another star with fusion...but eventually, with large solar panels in close orbit around the sun, we'll have an awful lot of energy to play with, and just maybe we'll figure out efficient laser or microwave power transmission sometime in the next thousand years.<p>On the other hand, maybe we'll just colonize the Oort Cloud and gradually migrate to other stars over the next million years or so without really trying.<p>(And, not that I'm holding my breath for this one, but if Woodward's right about the Mach effect we'll get to other stars pretty quickly.)<p>As for the reasons...the resources of the solar system are millions of times what's available on Earth.

2641075,comment,2640685,2640870,7,0,chernevik,,,"Here's a theory about the OP:<p>I am guessing that at $9.99, prospective customers assume that prior customer purchases don't reflect much due diligence -- that people would buy it for $10 ""just to see"", and just throw it away if bad.  Prospectives might then assume that $20 is enough to get priors to research it, or to think twice before recommending it, and that sales at that price thus do reflect quality.<p>But prospectives don't know anything about priors purchases, right?  Maybe prospectives are assuming that the stuff is selling at that price.  After all, the seller knows the market best, right?  And there is some truth to that assumption: If it hadn't sold at $20, it wouldn't have been around for long.<p>If that theory makes sense, it may be that your customers felt that $40 was high enough to suggest the consumer validation they needed.  Validation was only one component of their decision, ""value"" was another, and at 80 they didn't feel the value was there.  The theory suggests that if you had cut price below 40, your total sales would have fallen.<p>I imagine that buyers often treat prices like poker bets, and try to extract information about the underlying hand from the value assigned by the holder.",1307718019
2641074,comment,2639359,2640770,3,0,leemoore,,,"Theravada Buddhist Practitioner here. In addition to daily meditation practice, I've attended 8 months worth of meditation retreats in the last 4 years. These retreats consisted of 8-15 hours a day of formal meditation (depending on how hard I was going at it) with an effort to continuity of mindfulness in between formal sessions. At this point, I estimate I have about 3-4k of my 10k hours required for high mastery.<p>My understanding of the purpose and benefit of practice is to observe experience as it arises (whether physical sensations, sensory input or thoughts) as it arises and see how you react to it.<p>One key insight you find is we tend to contract toward things that are pleasant and contract away from experience that is unpleasant and space out (or seek distraction) during experience that is neutral or boring.  A cognitive understanding of this contraction and spacing out is insufficient to decondition the human brain from doing it. The conditioning is too deep.<p>It requires using concentration and mindfulness as a microscope on our perception to see and feel the additional pain we create in the contraction. As we repeatedly connect with the pain of contraction we slowly over time stop doing it and begin to experience life in a whole new way. The capacity to face pleasant, unpleasant and neutral experiences without contracting or spacing out is quite literally a life changer.",1307718015

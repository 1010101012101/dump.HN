This idea that the best ideas come from desperation isn't necessarily accurate anyway, builders want to build, its in their blood. It's why I hack on the weekends and played with breadboards and legos as a kid.<p>Having enough money allows me to focus on doing what I love best: building stuff.

I see many members of this community as miniature would-be robber barons.<p>It's something I've been thinking about - I don't generally see this trait in people I know from other fields like science or math, not at this incidence rate anyways. Either there are many more empathy-less people (to avoid the s-word) in other fields than I can see, or there is indeed a higher concentration of them in our field. Neither option sits very well.",1363492791
5388060,comment,5386249,5386806,1,0,elwin,,,"I think it's more accurate to say that the free market currently does not think that Internet surveillance is a problem. Consumers in general have decided that for Internet services and Internet access devices, factors such as cheapness, ease of use, and trendiness are more important than privacy.<p>Governments are able to reach more definitive consensus than free markets - a market would be not easily be able to make everyone use an anonymizing proxy, for example, but a government could legislate that. Governments can also move costs around, such as by funding a national proxy service with tax money.<p>But on one level, free markets and democratic governments are both just methods that societies use to enforce their collective wills. There are limits to how much their decisions can differ. There's a reason Schneier calls a situation created by Internet <i>companies</i> a surveillance <i>state</i>.",1363492791

""After all, when evaluating a Redfin job applicant one of the big questions Im trying to answer is when did she do something hard?<p>It could be something you put yourself through for fun like running a marathon or far more serious like fighting in a war.

It could be raising a child all by yourself.""<p>---------<p>I completely agree with this part. I have hired a 100+ people and the most impressive ones in the long run are usually people who have achieved something notable - published in a poetry book, achieved something in a competitive sport, etc.  - it doesn't seem to matter what it is, as long as they have done something hard, and that they know they achieved something.

There's a bit of taste as to when to name things in this instance, but certainly if a name can replace a comment then it's better to use a name. You might additionally use a name for something you wouldn't comment, if the logic is straightforward but the code is long enough that it would otherwise be hard to read.<p>If you use something more than once, then you either have to give it a name or repeat it, and generally people like to avoid repeating things.

I think that's fairly reasonable in the first world. Could a scenario arise in the future where that isn't reasonable? Sure.

Perhaps it has gone down so much, that it is no longer reasonable to address it if one want to maintain a modicum of concision.",1363489201

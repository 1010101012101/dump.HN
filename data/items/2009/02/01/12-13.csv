460828,comment,459961,460011,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"I find the assumption that the WWII spending helped us. As in ""Then, finally, geopolitical events took over, and World War II forced Roosevelt to spend as much money as Keynes wanted. "" In fact, our exports ramped up because the industrial capacity of the rest of the world was destroyed. Our economic golden era following the war was driven by exports- first selling military equipment to the UK, and then other industrial goods after the war as we were the one of the only places making anything.  The money we gave to other countries to rebuild was spent on a lot of American goods.<p>It's really the Chinese who are trying that approach, lending us money to buy their exports and then hopefully collecting the interest later (except we keep borrowing more money to pay the interest).  At some point (now?) this starts to fall apart.  One way is that we have massive inflation so that our future debts aren't worth much.",1233492949

460825,comment,459289,460706,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"-  When people with long enough attention spans are invested in the conversation they will read through many of the comments.  In many cases if you come into a conversation late you will be posting a reply because it is less likely you are coming in with a new angle.  If you are posting a reply it is more likely others will see your comment because it will be visible on their threads page.<p>-I think the example you gave is a very rare case (I hope.)  Unfortunately part of commenting right now is timing, which I do not have a problem with.  If you post something informative two days into the conversation it will not have the same exposure, although depending on the conversation it will not appear far below the fold.<p>-I do see your point and I think it would be great if good comments that come late have more visibility.  None or all of the following might help:<p>1) Delete comments and their replies once they reach a certain negative threshold (-5 for example.)  Of course this gives downmodding a whole new meaning but maybe that is a good thing.  This would make the comments section more readable and keep the conversation more civil and/or focused.<p>2) Highlight comments that were posted in the past 8 hours and have reached some karma threshold in yellow.  This is a sort of ""recent hot shots"" feature.  This way when an HN reader scans the page they can see what new comments are receiving upvotes more easily.<p>3) Give recent votes more weight then past votes.  This means that a karma point awarded now means more than a karma point awarded an hour ago.  Maybe the algorithm HN uses already does this- I am not sure.<p>I don't think pushing newer comments with fewer points up is a good idea because that changes the power up upvoting too drastically.  Perhaps some anchor tags at the top of the comments section leading to the hottest new comments?<p>p.s. nice blog",1233492405

460813,comment,460631,460631,0,0,almost,,,"I think this is a very good idea, but for a slightly different reason.\nThe whole points-for-posts thing creates a meta-game of accumulating\npoints above the normal game of participating in discussion. This\nleads to those annoying meta-disucssions where people complain about\nbeing down modded and all that goes with that.<p>The modding system is useful for ranking comments so that when I read\na massive thread the most interesting ones tend to be around the top.<p>It may also be useful for users as a feedback mechanism to figure out\nwhen they're doing something that's not cool (like the things we've\nbeen discussing in the guidelines thread today) but I don't think you\nneed a precise numerical score for that.

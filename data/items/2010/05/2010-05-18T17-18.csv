1358367,comment,1356630,1356630,0,0,geebee,,,"I grew up in San Francisco rather than New York, but a lot of this column resonated with me.  I was very hesitant to send my kid (almost 5 years old) to the local public school in San Francisco, largely because of my own experience attending these schools in the 70s.<p>After doing a lot of research (and much convincing from my wife and friends), I have come around to the same conclusion Brooks reached (I'm actually quoting Podhoretz, in the link Brooks references) - ""my small city is the same and yet it is not the same, because it is today, in almost every way, better"".<p>There is some loss.  San Francisco isn't as open as it used to be, not because it has become less tolerant, but because it has become so expensive.  Harvey Milk would have had trouble showing up in SF and finding his calling in life, simply because he never could have afforded the rent.  So SF is closed off in some ways.<p>High Tech is a creative field, and plenty of those folks are still coming here.  But there is also a different type of creative person, the kind who is only half aware of what he or she is working on, because it doesn't exist yet... my suspicion is that these people are going somewhere else now.  But I'm not 100% sure of that, SF is still a draw.  Guess we'll find out in another 30-40 years.",1274205491

After all, it's just a bunch of paper and ink and only a perceived value.  If you look at the damage this causes the economy, you can directly see the damage it causes a content creator.<p>""Go read Janis Ians writing on this, or Courtney Love, or countless of other artists that have spoken up about this.""<p>Boo Hoo. They signed a contract that gives the record companies their souls and are now complaining about it.  This argument is bullshit.  The creators of the Pirate bay don't really give a shit about the rights of anyone.  They freely admit that they believe in sharing of everything, just like when they were children.<p>I find it a little ironic that many of the same people that are pro-piracy get all in a tizzy when companies decide to sell their information, which is just a copy (you don't actually lose anything.  It's not like stealing a physical copy of something).<p>""Times are changing, we'll find a new equilibrium and those that had a free ride for a long time will have to find a different racket at some point. Technically speaking they're already dead.""<p>Really?  Create a full Metallica album from your house.  How about Photoshop?  If you can't, it means there is still a value for content creators.  Copying us much different than creating.  You seem to be equating them, which is just ridiculous.<p>Piracy pushes artists toward big corporations because they have no other way to make a living.<p>""Artists that make music for the love of their work will continue to do so, and will find a way to make money. Artists that are creations of the media machine will have a problem, but then again, most of them weren't in it for the art to begin with so there is probably not much lost there.""<p>Right, because people that love art don't need to actually make a living.<p>It is my belief that piracy has made many markets stagnant.  When you blur the line between losing sales due to piracy and losing sales due to a shitty product, content holders just increase copy protection rather than trying to innovate (because there is really no way to see the difference).<p>A real revolution would be creating a way for Indy artists to make a living and sell their music without a label.",1274205325

I'm working in field of robotics (more outdoors than anybots) and I wouldn't really want to see that yet. Robots are great at detecting obstacles to avoid with Lidar, they are not great at handling edge case scenarios. With our bot even in ""autonomous"" mode somebody is watching, not sure if I want to add a spinning blade to it.<p>All of the military bots are remote controlled, not autonomous. I can't think of any major autonomous vehicle being used for fluid tasks (i.e., not inventory robots). So what, you are going to have someone sitting there watching 10 robots mow lawns remotely? How much cheaper can that be than just hiring people to mow lawns.<p>I don't think robots are very good at replacing people in low wage jobs. A lot of uniformed people think that makes a lot of sense because robots replaced factory workers, but robots did not replace factory workers because they were cheaper. Robots replaced factory workers because they were better. They were faster and more accurate. A paint job done by a robot is better than one done by a human. I worked on a project automating the assembly of a medical device - it was just too damn small to be done by a person reliably. The system cost almost a million dollars, you could have paid the girl it displaced for years and years and years before you pay it off - except that the liability of making a medical device incorrectly is astronomical.<p>So I do not target low wage jobs as a prime market for robots, there is no money in it. Robots are good for replacing jobs that are the dull, dangerous, dirty, impossible for humans to do, repetitious etc.",1274203746

Stuff at the lower level of Maslow's hierarchy: Food, Shelter?<p>Producing quality content requires investment. How is a producer of that content to get a return on that investment if people don't pay for the product after it is produced?<p>I agree that we should all produce and share, but not all sharers produce.  Just because you have the bits on your hard drive does not mean the product those bits define are <i>yours</i> to share.  Those bits are not simply bits, they are the definition of something that creates value.  It takes risk to create the order of ones and zeros and if that risk is not rewarded, then the risk/reward ratio becomes too high and there is no incentive to take the risk to create the product.<p>I know that many people create for the love of the game, but those creators have to make money somehow. They have to have day jobs or something that distracts them from the many hours it takes to create quality content. If they could get paid for the content after it is produced, then they could spend more time creating more quality content for us to consume.<p>There was a quote from Ayn Rand about money where she describes money as a battery that stores labor so we can benefit from that labor over a longer time than it takes to perform the labor.  Well, those bits are just like that. Bits are a battery that stores the labor required to create the order of bits. Content production is the opposite of entropy and to defeat entropy, we must take energy from outside the system. The artist in this metaphor is the closed system -- the artist's brain is the system that creates the content.  The consumer is outside that system and must put energy into it in the form of food so that artist can use that energy to create order from a disordered set of random bits.<p>Money is that energy required to oppose entropy. Without a transfer of energy, there is no way to create order.  Without order, there is no content.  It's just white noise and consumers don't want that...<p>If consumers don't pay for the content, where will the energy to produce it come from?",1274203371

And, b) because research grants, at least the ones I know of which are given out by NSF and NASA, are not awarded based on what the government thinks but on how the proposal is rated by an independent panel of peer-reviewing scientists.<p>You can of course imagine second-order effects whereby the selection of the members of the peer-review committee is skewed by the program officers, picking panels that they think will give money to the programs they want. But if they consistently picked committee members that are out of the scientific mainstream, I think you'd hear a howl from the scientific community. I've heard plenty of complaints about the awards from people who weren't funded, but that the panels were stacked by people with predetermined ideas of what results should be obtained is not one of them.<p>As to your K-12 example, do you know for a fact that there are (competent) researchers who have applied for grants to conduct that study and were rejected? If not, you have no case.<p>If you think the government orders what research be done, you are woefully uninformed of how the vast majority of research is conducted in the US. Aside from a small number of researchers working in government facilities, research grants are awarded based on proposals from independent researchers. If no one applies to conduct a study, it won't happen no matter how much ""the government"" wants it to.

I don&#x27;t know how to interpret the word &quot;strategy&quot; without implying &quot;algorithm&quot;. The setup is that an interrogator sequentially queries the prisoners, and the prisoners have to come up with answers.<p>If you&#x27;re criticizing the idea that computability should be injected into talk of what a &quot;strategy&quot; is, then we have to get to the heart of the problem: are the prisoners different people or are they all &quot;manifestations of the same underlying strategy&quot;? (I&#x27;m saying that the ability to make a prior agreement about an infinite amount of information is tantamount to the prisoners losing their individuality and being &quot;merged&quot; into a kind of consciousness that speaks for all of the prisoners simultaneously). If they are different people, then we have to be able to formalize somehow the concept that information available to one is not available to another.<p>So I turn the question around: how do you propose to model the fact that the prisoners do not have insight into the &quot;raw visual sense data&quot; of the other prisoners, yet the &quot;raw auditory sense data&quot; is shared?<p>Now, back to the original problem: the hats are an attempt to hide under the rug the very difficult concept of being able to evaluate/compute the binary digits of a particular real number given some mathematical description of it. The key word is &quot;agree&quot;. The prisoners have to &quot;agree&quot; on something, and in this context, we aren&#x27;t sure what that means, but I&#x27;m taking it to mean that there is a finite alphabet they&#x27;re using to communicate, they can only communicate finite sentences, and other similar practical assumptions...<p>Since there are uncountably many real numbers and only countably many computable numbers, there are (in ZFC) plenty of real numbers whose existence and uniqueness have been proven, but which are not computable. This is going to turn out to be an insurmountable operational obstacle for the prisoners.<p>For example any Chaitin constant will do.

It all adds up to an amateurish feel. Some examples:<p>1. The colors. Ugh.<p>2. The formatting of the content boxes should be more consistent. All pictures should go to the edge and have the same height. Logos should have padding, not stretch to the edge (e.g. YouTube). Even once this is fixed, the different palettes in the different pictures are what&#x27;s contributing to the clutter. Maybe make all the pictures b&w... not sure. Do you need the chrome for these? Boxes with shading and extra lines is a bit dated. Check out digg.com for a better example of this style. Generally this is the biggest issue.<p>3. The &quot;Popular Lists&quot; graphic should be half/half on the area above/below. Right now, just a few pixels lay on the green area.

Consequently, Cassandra has evolved around those constraints, allowing you to efficiently journal thousands of cells to a single row, and to retrieve them in sorted order. Instead of modifying a cell, you write each distinct change to its own UUID-keyed cell.<p>Cassandra’s query language, CQL, provides some collection-oriented data structures around this model: sets, lists, maps, and so forth. They’re CRDTs, though the semantics don’t align with what you’ll find in the INRIA paper–no G-sets, 2P-sets, OR-sets, etc. However, some operations are safe–for instance, adding elements to a CQL set:\n<i>All 2000 writes succeeded. :-D</i><p>That’s terrific! This is the same behavior we saw with G-sets in Riak. However, not all CQL collection operations are intuitively correct. In particular, I’d be wary of the index-based operations for lists, updating elements in a map, and any type of deletions. Deletes are implemented by writing special tombstone cells, which declare a range of other cells to be ignored. Because Cassandra doesn’t use techniques like OR-sets, you can potentially delete records that haven’t been seen yet–even delete writes from the future. Cassandra users jokingly refer to this behavior as “doomstones”.<p>The important thing to remember is that because there are no ordering constraints on writes, one’s merge function must still be associative and commutative. Just as we saw with Riak, AP systems require you to reason about order-free data structures. In fact, Cassandra and Riak are (almost) formally equivalent in their consistency semantics–the primary differences are in the granularity of updates, in garbage collection/history compaction, and in performance.<p>Bottom line: CQL collections are a great idea, and you should use them! Read the specs carefully to figure out whether CQL operations meet your needs, and if they don’t, you can always write your own CRDTs on top of wide rows yourself.&quot;",1404596260

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get some feedback on styling, content etc (it&#x27;s not really to my taste, but hey, it&#x27;s not terrible either), but if you are seeing slow growth, it&#x27;s probably not because your site tech/design sucks, it&#x27;s because no-one really deeply wants to make lists in the first place. The idea and marketing is the problem, not the execution.<p>So, who is the site for, what&#x27;s the target market/demographic? Who are they making the lists for?<p>Perhaps instead of targeting everyone, you should narrow your focus, and start targeting a particular market. This sort of site needs either a very specific focus to which the list making and content are tailored - say shopping lists, or it needs a specific demographic.<p>If you want to make this a social site, perhaps target a demographic like Norwegian teens OR mums if you have experience there, but don&#x27;t target the entire world from the start.<p>If you want to make money from shopping, maybe tailor this to just best of lists of products for particular niches and invest in content?<p>As it is I don&#x27;t see how lists about <i>These 7 Things Will Make Any Man Want to Fight for You</i> and <i>Best Tracks in Mario Kart 8</i> are going to keep anyone on your site.

It doesn&#x27;t improve support for concurrency patterns (like coroutines and channels). Python now has concurrent.futures, yield from, and the (overly complicated) asyncio library, which provide a toolkit for concurrent programming patterns, but it&#x27;s not really beautiful nor a joy to use. That&#x27;s part 2 of Armin&#x27;s proposal, and he&#x27;s asking for donations to fund it (see the link above).<p>2. Until recently PyPy was still regarded as an experimental side project, and had memory use limitations that prevented it from being a drop-in CPython replacement. CPython is a simpler codebase than PyPy and supports more targets and environments. PyPy does deal with native C code via cffi, but there is a lot of code that uses CPython-specific C bindings that will need to be updated to run on PyPy.<p>3. I think the Python world is doing great. The Python 2 to 3 and CPython to PyPy migrations are largely orthogonal, and will coalesce to &quot;PyPy 3000 with STM&quot; soon enough. Once that happens, I think that will serve as a really powerful foundation for future improvements. (Writing code that runs on both 2.7 and 3.3+ is not that hard, by the way.)",1404595941

7992990,comment,7991544,7992875,2,0,nycticorax,,,"I can&#x27;t speak for others, but here are my objections to Gnome 3:<p>1.  It is application-centric, rather than window-centric.<p>For instance, alt-tab tabs between applications, not between windows.  This doesn&#x27;t mesh well with how I work: I want to alt-tab between different things I&#x27;m working on, and alt-tabbing gets in the way of this.  Often, I&#x27;ll have a bunch of terminal windows that are very much different things, or a bunch of emacs windows that are different things, and I want alt-tab to switch between all of them, regardless of which happen to be the same application.<p>Application-centricity also drives Gnome 3&#x27;s behavior when you click on a launcher icon for an already-running program, and the Gnome 3 behavior is less useful to me than the Gnome 2 behavior.<p>2.  Sometimes I just want a window to get the heck out of my face.  That&#x27;s why having a button to close a window is nice.  Gnome 3 gets rid of this.<p>3.  ...but eventually I&#x27;ll probably want to see that window again, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to see all my current windows at a glance on the bottom bar.  Gnome 3 got rid of this, also.<p>4.  I don&#x27;t like having multiple desktops (I like to be able alt-tab between any and all of my windows at a time).  Gnome 3 structures the whole UI around multiple desktops.<p>5.  I like having my pull-down menus attached to each window.  When you have a big screen, or multiple big screens, it takes a long time to scroll all the way over to your primary screen to get at a pull-down menu.  (Yes, I know about Fitt&#x27;s Law.  But if you&#x27;re far enough away from an on-the-screen-edge menu, it will still be slower than a not-on-the-screen-edge menu that&#x27;s nearby.  I don&#x27;t know where that point happens, but it _feels_ like it happens pretty commonly when you have two 30&quot; monitors and your window is on the secondary one.)<p>6.  I like pull-down menus.  They&#x27;re been a central element of GUIs since 1984 at least.  Gnome 3 seems to want to get rid of them, or at least add another layer of clicks to get to them.  All to get the amount of &quot;chrome&quot; off the screen, because it supposedly distracts people or something.  (Or so they say.  I think it&#x27;s more because they&#x27;re designers, and they perhaps value aesthetics over functionality a bit more than I do.)<p>7.  Gnome 3 wants to support touch devices, and by their own admission many of the design features are driven by this.  This seems like a big mistake to me.  I think desktops and tablets/phones are different enough that they need different UIs.  Apple seems to agree with me (or I with them, really), and MS seems to disagree.  Do you hear a lot of good things about Windows 8?<p>8.  Even if you like the menubar to be at the top of the screen, I don&#x27;t see how anyone can think that Gnome 3 did this well.  They&#x27;ve set aside that whole top bar, and rather than putting something useful there (like, I don&#x27;t know, maybe pull-down menus?), they leave most of it blank and put a clock right in the middle?  And relegate the pull-down menus to a single application menu, so you need any extra click to get to anything?  The only advantage of the Gnome 3 top panel is that it looks nice.  Which I think is a big reason they did it that way.<p>9.  I know that a lot of these things can be configured to be like I&#x27;d prefer them, but why would I do this, when Mate exists?  It works like I want right out of the box.  And honestly, Linux desktops are generally at least slightly janky in their default configurations.  Using some super-customized configuration just makes it that much more likely that something won&#x27;t work right.<p>10.  This whole &quot;just get over it and move on&quot; attitude about Gnome 3 is based on the false assumption that it&#x27;s a done deal, that Gnome 3 is the future, and we&#x27;re all stuck with it.  We&#x27;re not.  (And we&#x27;re certainly not stuck with the Gnome 3 Shell.)  If enough people say &quot;no&quot; to the Gnome 3 Shell, it will go away.  There are signs of this already: RHEL7 ships with Gnome 3 in classic mode (or fallback mode, or whatever they&#x27;re calling it this week), which is an attempt to mimic many elements of the Gnome 2 interface.  (Most of that mimicry is only skin-deep, but that&#x27;s another story.)  Debian is considering shipping with Xfce as the default interface.  Mate is picking up momentum as a viable alternative to Gnome 3.  So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear that we&#x27;re stuck with the Gnome 3 shell, at least in its current form.  There&#x27;s still hope...<p>OK, that went a little far afield.  But those are some of my objections to Gnome 3.",1404595358

Best guess as to what they&#x27;re arguing is that by making the cryptotokens redeemable for a service (as opposed to actual cash), they&#x27;re really issuing something closer to gift cards than traditional equity.

There&#x27;s nothing about crypto-equity that makes fraud any less likely than traditional equity. So if you&#x27;re the SEC, and you see someone selling something that acts like equity, looks like equity, is <i>actually described as equity</i>, and poses the same risks for the buyer that regular equity does, the fact that it might not fit neatly in the traditional definition of equity isn&#x27;t going to deter you from putting a stop to this.",1404594836

It was trivial to set up anonymous shell entities and hide who owned what, making it practically untraceable.",1404594310

The class delves into Therac-25, and similar cases that have happened since. I found the class really interesting because it does make you question and think about the ethics of what you are building and what others have built.<p>Knowing about, and thinking about, the ACM Code of Ethics, Stuxnet, Therac-25, the Windows Security Patch Policy, and other problems our programming culture have come across is important. Realizing that the code we write can affect people in both positive and negative ways on a long and short term scale is something that can change both your product and how you build a product.",1404594307

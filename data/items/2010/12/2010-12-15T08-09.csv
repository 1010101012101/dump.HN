In addition to the usual strategies and walk-throughs, every issue also contained hex editing guides for various popular games.  I could follow the instructions well enough, but I didn't understand hexadecimal numbers, so it was just monkey-see-monkey-do.  Then one day, while flipping through computer books at an underground store, I ""got"" hex numbers, and my mind was blown.  A whole new game hacking vista opened up in my mind's eye.<p>2. While learning Clojure, I tried my hand at implementing the Lisp interpreter described in PG's ""The Roots of Lisp"" paper.  There were many ""aha!"" moments along the way, but the biggest one came when I understood how I could define the ""eval"" function inside my interpreter, which allowed me to run a Lisp interpreter inside my Lisp interpreter (which was running in Clojure, which was running on the JVM, etc.).",1292400325

If anything, they present a much easier target than cancer or other end-of-life diseases, because viruses are comparatively simple little infectious agents and comprise the sole cause of the disease, so a cure only needs to attack one thing.  Their genome is on the order of a few thousand base pairs, usually only 10-100 genes.  You should check out all the new antiviral drugs that have been developed over the last decade, it is really the product of the new age of genome-level research. [1]  The main problem in developing antiviral drugs is toxicity, because viruses co-opt certain parts of the cell and have proteins that are usually similar to normal human genes, and you have to find treatments that only target the viral activity.  For example, the first commercially successful antiviral [2] targets reverse transcriptase, which performs a function that normal human cells never do (transcribe RNA -> DNA).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyclovir"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyclovir</a>",1292400109

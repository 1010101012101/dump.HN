I'd bet that YouNoodle used these widely known startups as a training set for its algorithm, or at least as a test set...I imagine if one of their unit tests came back and said ""Facebook is gonna be worthless"", someone would tinker with the algorithms until it didn't say that anymore.  Usually you deal with this problem by setting aside some data points until the very end for you to evaluate your accuracy, but without knowledge of where they got their training set, you can't really do this yourself",1217973436

The language is simple (if ugly, and an evolutionary dead end), the problem is comparatively simple, and the batch notion eliminates a lot of the complexities people deal with in modern ""realtime"" systems.

Only God knows what will really happen and it sounds like there is an over-emphasis on the Social Proof of those associated with a startup. Opportunities exist that can present themselves to anyone.<p>It says: ""YouNoodle aims to make the prediction right before the first round of funding for a company.""<p>What happens if a company can't or doesn't raise capital? If there were a tool on the site like the just launched <a href=""http://webequity.com.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webequity.com.com.au</a> <a href=""http://bit.ly/3lZTZa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/3lZTZa</a>, these startups could still launch whereby the team is paid with equity in the startup instead of cash.<p>Also, with the valuations in place, tools could be provided to raise money by way of small payments from investors who would also use the site. Alternatively, tools may exist to simply locate such investors with the financial exchange to take place off-site. Such investors may co-invest alongside a high-profile investor who leads the round and who takes an active role in monitoring and working with the company. In this way, a company can uphold its valuation by enabling many diversely sourced investors to access a round who are prepared to pay a premium to access such an investment that they would otherwise not be able to find or participate in, and are likewise also willing to forgoe any board seat claim.",1217972834

267925,comment,267641,267909,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"It's a bit more nuanced than that. One of the social sites I briefly used counted clicks more then upvotes. Predictably, being a 30ysh year old male, I usualy clicked on links promising pictures of (more or less necked) women. In less then two weeks most of my personalized content was either porn or lolcats.<p>The moral of the story: while I do enjoy the ocasional porn and lolcat, it's definitely not what I want from the net (also why I didn't use the site for more then 2 weeks). It's just that it was much easier for their algorithm to categorize those things then the much more abstract ""interesting"", or even the somewhat less abstract ""programming"".<p>edit: It's not that social sites are doomed. It's just they're damn harder to get right then just digg, and they're still in infancy.",1217972725

The Acura TL vs. MS6 would be a better comparison.<p>Finally, gas mileage is much more related to the weight of the car mated to the engine, rather than the horsepower output of the engine itself.

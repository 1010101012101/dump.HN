I fail to see how you can make the leap from saying that shorting is bad for society to saying that we should ban shorting.  Alcohol is bad for society, we should ban alcohol.  Television is bad for society, we should ban television.<p>In America, it's currently Memorial Day, when we celebrate the people who have fought and died to defend our freedoms -- even freedoms that seem bad.  Our soldiers carry our flag into battle and die for our right to burn that flag in protest of their actions.<p>I hope you aren't an American, given the way you so flippantly propose throwing away freedoms because it might hurt poor little society.  ""Society"" isn't a thing.  There are only people.  If you propose a change in the laws, then you need to argue about individuals and the liberties they will gain or lose, the freedoms that will be protected or weakened.  If you propose throwing away some liberty, you must make a very strong case indeed, as it is much easier to destroy liberty than to win it back.<p>You are essentially proposing that we take freedom from traders to give security to stakeholders.  (Nevermind the fact that stakeholders are often the traders.)  That is almost never a win.  Without liberty, there is no security.  Just ask any slave or dictator's subject.",1275314362

The only advice given is to not exceed a single user's data, otherwise it's too big.<p>Really, I want to see an example of a request handler that creates data in multiple entities and takes care to not create duplicates.<p>> <i>It would be very interesting to see what the results would be with some more realistic testing.</i><p>IMHO, my experience with AppEngine's datastore has been pretty bad ... the performance varies greatly based on factors you can't control ... i.e. processing something that does well on slow Fridays, may throw the 30 secs timeout error on Mondays.<p>Also, I don't know how people deploy real-world apps on it ... a non-relational datastore requires custom indexes (i.e. precalculated queries done by building specialized entities out of your quasi-normalized data).<p>You can't do that easily because of the 30 secs limit that also applies to cron or queue jobs. I tried a workaround by having a queue task that processes 5 rows at a time and then reschedules itself. The stuff was so god-damn awful to debug, and the results so unpredictable (30 secs timeout for 5 rows / concurrency issues) that I felt like crying.<p>But yeah, it's fine for hosting a blog engine on top of it.",1275314331

1392502,comment,1392003,1392003,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> With hindsight, we can always see through the dubious “authority” of such historical sources. Few things look as unstable as the rock-solid certainties of previous ages. Since encyclopedias are supposed to be balanced and disinterested, the bias often seems even more naked.<p>Oh, he comes so so so close to what I wanted him to say, but he didn't say it! He was right there, but couldn't pull the trigger on, ""...and our current sources are almost certainly as biased.""<p>Actually, I'll go a step further - the official story of the present is almost certainly entirely false, but so is the ""official story"" of history. If you read primary sources, it quickly becomes obvious that the explanation behind most important events understood now is at best glaringly incomplete.<p>Here's a major example:<p>The United States was one of the closest allies of Japan for up to three years before the bombing of Pearl Harbor. America supported the Meiji Side during the Meiji Restoration, which was Japan's civil war that switched from control by Shogun (head military and on-Earth leader) to control by Emperor (head of everything in the religion of the time, but had been not involved with earthly affairs for the 250 years prior to the Meiji Restoration). The post-Meiji Japanese government and American government got along really, really well and were great trading partners. As of 1939, Japan was importing 80% of its oil and more than half of its scrap metal from the United States, buying lots of arms and ships too. (America sold arms to all parties in WWII prior to 1940 - the English, French, Germans, Russians, Nationalist Chinese, Communist Chinese, Japanese, and a few more places)<p>Then... in 1941 the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor. WTF?<p>Really, WTF? That'd be like the United States bombing one of Taiwan's military bases in 2014. That's four years from now. How the heck would that happen?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Control_Act#.22Moral_embargo.22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Control_Act#.22Moral_emb...</a><p>Hmm...<p>Also not covered in that article - besides the embargo, the United States declared Japan ""a hostile nation"" and started moving troops, equipment, and weapons into Hawaii and the Philippines (the Philippine Islands were owned by the USA at the time).<p>To try to give you an example of the scope of this, this would be a lot like if Iran said that no OPEC countries could sell oil to the United States, declared the United States an enemy of Iran, and started moving tanks and soldiers to the Iran/Iraq border. The U.S. might not attack, but would anyone be surprised if they did?<p>Now, there's two points worth mentioning. First, is that whenever I tell people about this, the most frequent thing I hear is, ""Yes, but Japan was doing evil things."" Okay, sure, I agree with you. But the United States have had favorable relations with a lot of countries that did a lot of evil things in history, including the Soviets who were considerably more evil than the IJA, and including European powers when they were at war and committing genocide in various different times and places in history.<p>Second, enforcing that ""moral embargo"" cost the United States thousands of Americans dead and millions of dollars... and now it's not talked about any more. I think it's worth talking about and knowing about. The official story learned about WWII is that ""Japan was evil and totally psycho, so despite the fact that they were already at war with a half dozen countries across multiple fronts, they attacked the largest neutral power in the world who was formerly their close ally."" Which... doesn't add up. The ""Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because they're totally crazy and psycho"" angle was always wrong, but few people know it now. I mean, they'll know it in the year 2300 or whatever, just like we understand why Rome took out Carthage now, but I'd say modern knowledge and understanding about events is often biased, and it's worth comparing our understanding to an early primary or secondary whenever possible.",1275313562

Libertarian thought tells us that variations in individuals are more important than societal standards. Not that people are ""bad"" or ""good""<p><i>Taking a determinist consequentialist position allows us to do so more effectively. </i><p>This strikes me as the difference between an academic argument and a practical one. Academically, sure, the numbers add up. Practically, this is completely terrible advice, for the sole reason that the criteria suggested are not only indeterminate but suffer large variations as applied by different individuals. And offering up some sort of scientific committee or standards for what to blame people for is totally whacked, for reasons I'll leave as an exercise to the reader.<p>I liked the observation that people who condemn others may do so because others have not sacrificed. This fits intuitively with what I have observed.<p>I'd add another detail, though. There is a long tradition in western thought that the individual's struggles with character traits that he or she don't like has value in itself. We always should have a place we would like to be that we cannot attain. Western medicine and ideals, however, seem to feel that if we commonly view one condition as ""better"" or ""worse"" than another, some sort of chemical or social intervention is required in order to make people better. This worked great when ""worse"" = the plague, but the model is falling apart when ""worse"" = too fat. The types of structures and systems of thought we have set up for the plague do not naturally extend to shyness.

Treatment is a nonsense word in this application. ""Treatment"" is just a way to use social tricks to get them to make different choices while making them believe it's a disease so they don't resist treatment. Real treatment for alcoholism is a liver transplant. Real treatment for obesity is liposuction. They only way to stop damaging yourself is to take responsibility and stop doing what you've been doing. Telling people they are powerless robs them of their dignity and is an outright lie. The person with the problem is the only one with the power to change!  The treatment industry in America is a racket that is mostly based on the AA 12 Steps. At best it has a 5% success rate.

A menu-based system is easy to use, and with a configuration mini-language you can produce complex configuration data with a few keystrokes.<p>CML2 already has most of this. It is a mini-language written in Python so that you can create rules for your configuration. Based on your selection of symbols, the configuration rules decide on the visibility and/or value of other symbols. All symbols are gathered in hierarchical menus which are then displayed in the graphical GUI.<p>We accompany this with python scripts to generate header files, but also extract information from the symbols to drive the build.<p>CML2 is unfortunately unmaintained and has some limitations.<p>One other alternative is the linux kernel configuration system, but I don't want to use that as it is based on older scripting methods.<p>Out of these two I haven't seen anything else to this extent, which is why would like to know how people configure their software for building.",1275311691

But if they are back in 12 months time with the same problem then there is the same lowering of moral imperative to provide help. If nothing else it is likely a temporary solution again and, so, other forms of treatment/help should be encouraged (I'd even argue it is morally better to suggest other ideas first in such circumstances)<p>(I'm using the royal you btw :))",1275311368

So while very few people would argue that height isn't largely genetic, most people also accept that it takes proper nutrition in order to grow tall.  So even though height is genetic, and South and North Koreans largely share the same genetics, South Koreans are way taller than North Koreans.<p>The genetic argument for obesity is that in areas of occasional famine, it made evolutionary sense to horde food in your gut, particularly fatty food.  Until very recently in human history, there just wasn't that much fatty food for your average citizen to horde.  Now there is, particularly because food corporations have realized over time that the fattier the food, the more of it they sell, and those previously advantageous genes are running amok.  Not everyone has those genes because in places of plenty, those genes aren't that advantageous.<p>I'd agree that that isn't an entirely convincing argument.

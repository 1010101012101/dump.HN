Being a programmer, especially at a big corp(who are the one more likely to hire a junior dev) entails a lot of not so nice things :  dealing with legacy code, endless-useless meetings, retarded/old tools. poorly written/undocumented code, debugging etc... etc...<p>Why don&#x27;t you leverage your current position as an Sys admin/IT manager. As someone mentioned in the comment, programming is about solving interesting problems, and i am pretty sure you could find some very interesting and useful processes to automate in your current position. As a dev myself, a sys admin/Manager that could produce useful tools for us would be a god send and a very valuable asset to our company.The advantage of staying at you current position and evolving your job responsibility to include some coding  is that you get to define and create exactly what software you want , using whichever platform/ language you want which avoiding the not so nice aspect of being a full time dev.<p>As for the ressources, i would check coursera. They have very good course on CS, especially Algo 1 which looks like exactly what you need.",1435805996

We provide sophisticated software and robust analytics to elevate quality of care for cancer patients. Our organizational strategy, capabilities and resources are unified around a deep commitment to quality and value in oncology, and the goal of reducing the physical and financial burden of cancer treatment and survivor-ship. We are looking for others to join our team where you can start to deliver an immediate impact to the healthcare of others suffering from cancer.<p>For all positions we value skill-set over tool-set and ability over qualifications.  The team you’re joining is  small, highly skilled, and reasonably good at ping pong. Our offices are relaxed, kitchen is well-stocked, and we have fluffy dogs on site.<p>* Network Admin/DevOps - We are looking for relentless problem-solvers to join our DevOps team. You will help us predict the future, figure out when we need new stuff before we need it. Attention to uptimes and familiarity with monitoring concepts. You will talk to the team, and you’ll work closely with others within the company to bring projects from planning to launch.<p>* Front-end Developer - Someone focused on delivering products with a great UX. Experience building fat JS MVC apps, designing complex stateful apps in a maintainable way, with data visualization using D3 or Processing.  Knowledgeable of HTML5, ES6, CSS3, and Web standards are important.  You should be able to rapidly prototype features and designs.<p>* Back-end Developer - Experienced developers, who have worked on a decent number of products, have a propensity for shipping often, probably with years of experience and amazing coding chops (those having left coding behind them—this isn&#x27;t the company for you, unfortunately).  If you are a polyglot thinker/Functional language lover then you earn bonus points.  You should be eager to learn/teach other on the team about TDD, continuous integration, and functional paradigms.<p>Shoot any questions or apply by emailing nathan@radialogica.com",1435805571

9816566,story,,,1,0,srhack,"Stock Options Cliff and Corp/VC Reputation",,"I was recently fired from a startup just before the one-year anniversary. Because the stock option plan had a one-year cliff I didn&#x27;t get to keep any options. I was surprised to find out that this is not uncommon. With hardly any effort I discovered three similar cases of senior people with amazing backgrounds getting fired before the one year anniversary. Clearly, companies can get away with behavior like this because few people are going to talk publicly about getting fired.<p>What would be the best way to track a company or VC reputation? Glassdoor may work for large companies but doesn&#x27;t seem to work for smaller ones. Since the state Gov already tracks employment, why not make those statistics public? This can include number of employees hired/fired per category, compensation range, gender, age, benefits offered, stock options, sr staff turnover and perhaps other useful stats. We regulate info to buy a company stock, why not do the same for the labor market?<p>I know that the political systems is mostly run by corporations but why can&#x27;t we think of a better system that will make the labor market more transparent and fair? After all, good reputable companies will benefit from transparency. In California we vote for lots of silly propositions, why not proposing something useful.<p>Finally, what is the rationale for the 1-year cliff other than screw employees? Why do we make it so easy for a corporation to fire someone? I don&#x27;t think it should be too hard but there should be a process and more balance and it should have a higher cost for companies (unless they are truly out of $). Perhaps employment agreements should be standardized and made public so critics can review them.<p>Because of lack of transparency individuals are at a disadvantage unless we change the rules of the game though the democratic process.<p>Anyone out there has similar feelings/thoughts? Are there any meetups where people talk about these issues?",1435804839

9816560,comment,9812289,9816410,0,0,korynunn,,," - Most screen readers handle DOM updates just fine.<p>- I&#x27;m defining a web-app as something that feels like an application, not a website. If you are making a news site, fastn probably isn&#x27;t the way to render everything. You can however just use fastn enhanced functionality, since it isn&#x27;t a framework, just a tool to make chunks of UI.<p>- on average, 99% of users have JavaScript installed. As above, if your target audience is `literally everyone`, sure, fastn probably isn&#x27;t the way to go. Having been a library developer for nearly a decade now, I am intimately aware that different browsers have differences. Fastn should work the same on all modern browsers, and if you find any bugs, let me know and I&#x27;ll fix them :).<p>- Delays from loading additional files will be negligible. Not sure how to back that statement up tho ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<p>- As mentioned, rendering a fastn app on the client is very fast, faster than serving an equivalent page from ASP.net for example, even in a 1:1 race. The issue with server-side templating is that there is one server rendering N requests, whereas with client-side rendering, the N clients are doing the heavy (actually pretty light) lifting.<p>- I spend an enormous chunk of my time doing performance analysis and improvements. Have a look at recent commits to fastn or enti (the databinding module) and you will see quite a few commits with &quot;performance&quot; in them. We have non-trivial applications using fastn that perform at extremely acceptable speed (hundreds of fields, with live validation, across multiple tabs, renders in around 150ms)<p>- My work PC is only a few times faster than my Nexus 5. Btw, the homepage renders in 1.2s(~500ms JS) on my phone.<p>I hope you do give it a go. Fastn isn&#x27;t a tool for every job, that&#x27;s the point, it&#x27;s just a tool. It&#x27;s up to the developer to decide if it is appropriate.<p>It has been developed mostly with cordova apps in mind (and yes, they have been made with it, and are quite snappy), where abandoning HTML is actually really nice.

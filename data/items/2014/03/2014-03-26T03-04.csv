The founders believed enough in themselves and their vision to tell these people to go fuck themselves, they were going to go their own way. The reason people react negatively to this is because they see huge potential in Oculus and don&#x27;t feel Facebook has the incentives to execute on VR the way Oculus was poised to, especially now that the founders/execs effectively have lost their ability to control the company (PR statements notwithstanding.)<p>Honestly, it feels that for all the talk about the huge future of VR by Oculus, if they really believed in it, no number would be big enough to get them to give up control of how that future is built. Most entrepreneurs who are in the business of changing the world are not that interested in relinquishing any control to someone else no matter how much that will get them paid.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I know what the deal is here, that Facebook basically told them that they can take their investors out of the picture and have the full resources to build the best consumer product they want to with custom hardware. This certainly would sound enticing but the problem is that as soon as the going gets tough that lack of absolute control is going to start to rear its head. Zuck is going to have the final call on everything, and when the VR wars heat up you can be sure he is going to make different decisions than an independent Oculus would.",1395805940

The party that provided the goods would owe income tax on the capital gain of the goods (fair market value minus the cost paid, or basis).<p>If both parties are exchanging goods, then it gets more complicated. In some cases (I trade you the deed for my apartment in the city for the deed for your beach house), the IRS deems it a &quot;like-kind exchange&quot;, which is NOT a taxable event -- the basis of the old items carries over to the new properties. However, if I exchange my apartment for your car, then it&#x27;s not a like-kind exchange, because the items exchanged are not of like kind (makes sense?), and both parties pay capital gains (or can claim a loss) vs. the fair market value of the exchange.<p>To add to the fun, one can do a delayed like-kind exchange by storing the proceeds with a &quot;qualified intermediary&quot;, a form of escrow agent. This is often done with real estate, since it means that the counterparties don&#x27;t have to be willing to swap deeds. To give a specific example, I could sell my apartment in the city, deliver the proceeds to a qualified intermediary, and use them later to buy a beach house, and it would be treated as a tax-free exchange by the IRS (if the prices of the two properties are equal and some other criteria are met).",1395805139

There were also critics who suggested it might be too immersive: detracting from face-to-face conversations.<p>Over time the technical &quot;Wow&quot; factor of film mostly faded. In its absence, viewers started to remember what made virtual reality feel real all along: the quality of the content.

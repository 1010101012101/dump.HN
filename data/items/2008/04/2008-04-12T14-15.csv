Essay editing (and double-checking anything, for that matter) is about THINKING.<p>Write something, then read, THINK, and improve.  Repeat.<p>No more changes on the last pass?  You're done.<p>(How many passes did this post take?  Four.  The secondary point of this post is to suggest making it a habit of double-checking everything you write)",1208012356
161850,comment,161372,161730,0,0,aflag,,,"yes, sure. But the thing is, if you have to do something like work, even if it's the coolest thing, it gets sucky.<p>For example, I love programming and I love learning math. But working with programming feels really bad sometimes. There are deadlines, there are times you have to work long hours on a row in something you don't like much, or you liked at first but now it doesn't feel good anymore. I'm not sure we can escape that on the system we live in.<p>Also, doing math on school (high school and university) a lot of times feel really bad. Sometimes you have to take a test on stuff you don't really feel like studying at that time, or maybe you won't feel like studying ever. And you end up not having time to study what you want, or you end up studying less of it.<p>I don't know, maybe it's the morning coffee talking, but I just don't see the society making progress towards making life of the individual better. Or rather, it seems to associate production with happiness, while I'm not sure that's the case.",1208011830

161845,comment,161269,161796,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That doesn't measure what brand advertising wants to measure, though.  If one ad gets 16 clickthroughs that result in 4 transactions, that ad is inferior to one that gets 0 clickthroughs but results in 8 sales when customers actually go to the store.<p>Brand advertising works because most consumers rely on a recognition heuristic when faced with the dozens of products in a store.  They'll buy products they recognize, even if they have no personal experience with the product.  You don't go out and buy an All-New Mercedes Benz immediately because you saw it on TV - but when it comes time to buy a car, you're far more likely to buy it because of all the associations that its name & image bring up.  You can't measure this with any existing web metrics - it may be years before customers actually go out and make a purchase.",1208011113

Although it is nice, you don't need to get fancy when simple things satisfy your needs.<p>I think you can't really rely on people to withhold their votes when the content is engineered to take advantage of the human psyche.<p>Could a bayesian filter really separate fact and fiction? Cross-correlated ancedote and rumour? Satire and sensationalism? Humans struggle. Maybe one day...<p>The community doesn't seem to be able to correct itself, so if the content starts to veer away from the site's original principles, some external force is needed to gently nudge it back on track.<p>All that said, I don't really have a considered opinion on whether or not blacklisting Valleywag is a good thing; it is not something that I care much about.",1208011070

If there would be any tweaking it would be to attribute some kind of score to people/sites which will weight give them a handicap score which will work alongside the standard voting algorithm.  I don't agree that they should be automatically banned though",1208010736

161838,comment,160923,160923,0,0,thevapid,,,"I agree with the first comment by Xichekolas and also Raphael's comment (4th). MSFT is a very very large company. Most news sites paint the picture that everyone is switching to online word editors... the only people who I know use online editors are advanced tech savvy users who hate the load time of MSFT Office. However, I would still always use Office for doing any type of professional document such as essays, letters, resumes, etc.<p>Just because there are alternatives, doesn't mean the main competitor is doomed. Perhaps in the long term, with Bill Gates no longer at the helm since 2000 (which is when Google came to rise), MSFT might be in trouble in the next 15 years or so.<p>Cheers<p>P.S. I used to read Digg many years ago when it was still up and coming but now I cannot bare to read that site. The news posts are always the same predictable things and the commentators are so unintelligent it's almost mind numbing just being there. Great site here, will try to comment every  once in a while and weigh in.",1208009308
161837,comment,161523,161523,0,0,sc,,,"> After all, anything creative requires greater mental effort on behalf of your users to understand and is unlikely to spread as quickly.<p>You can always consider design as usability: Apple and 37signals are the ""big"" names we know that follow and lead this mantra. Their products are creative, but intuitive. You could even consider the intuitiveness itself a major creative element; user understanding is at the forefront of their products, so they are profitable, as well.<p>In the end, it's an issue of quality.",1208009163

If killing an animal is morally repugnant to you, perhaps eating the protein byproduct of a bacterial culture wouldn't rub you the wrong way?<p>As prices come down to near hamburger level, I would be willing to change to vat grown to spare cows the feedlot unpleasantness they are exposed to now. Of course this would reduce the worldwide population of cattle, so its a moral judgment whether a smaller number leading better lives is preferable--is welfare measured by the sum or average--I'd lean towards the smaller and better camp to the tune of about 15 cents a pound.",1208009002

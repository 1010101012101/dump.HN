352094,comment,351892,351892,0,0,sanj,,,"It seems to me that this allows Myspace to identify owned content but does very little in terms of monetizing that content.  How often -- really -- have you watched something on Youtube and said ""Geez, I'd like to buy that!""<p>All this appears to do is to provide some ammo to the copyright holders that the technology exists to deal with takedown notices efficiently.",1225720156

352092,comment,351833,352015,0,0,replicatorblog,,,"I wouldn't call the spate of articles on 3D printing and mass customization Spam. I wrote 2 of the five that have shown up recently and they were efforts to help share info on manufacturing technologies with a group of hacker with the hope of fostering some new ideas. While some items on the list may be old news I took care to highlight many that are currently flying under the Radar (Spoonflower & Xoddo) to name two.<p>There were other posts highlighting the RepRap project and an honest question about what one would do with these technologies. They stayed on the board because people were interested in them.",1225719820
352091,comment,351713,351766,0,0,dejb,,,"> George Bush has taught me to evaluate politicians by their actions, not their words.<p>To me his words, actions and the results were all pretty consistent. Only the scale of failure of his presidency was a surprise... And the fact that he was voted in twice. You sound like you may have been one of his 'x2' voters. If this was the case it doesn't present the best credentials to be lecturing others on candidate selection.",1225719690

Following up to the actual post by the MS team reveals Linq to SQL isn't being killed--they're just choosing Linq to Entities as their preferred solution.<p>""We are listening to customers regarding LINQ to SQL and will continue to evolve the product based on feedback we receive from the community as well,"" is not remotely the same as killing Linq to SQL.",1225719642

352078,comment,351713,351813,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"On the general topic if words matter in politics -- my answer is ""no""<p>Actions are all that count. People are a fickle bunch, and it's an old trick to sound good on TV and then do whatever you feel like -- as long as it's complicated enough to the average Fred that he's not going to get pissed.<p>That's true for both parties. Look to how people act in the past -- it's a good predictor for the future. (Aside from 9-11 type events)",1225718040

I'm building JavaScript to call links, and then making sure that everything works sans JS.<p>I dunno why I'm catching flak for this. The display bug had nothing to do with JavaScript; it was primarily a CSS issue. The JS in that page only coincidentally fixed the CSS issue, which is exactly the kinds of backwards testing I was talking about (and obviously didn't do the last time I updated it).<p>See, in order for the layout to work with a minimum number of images, there's a CSS trick in some overlapping layers. The JS in the page coincidentally extends one of those layers when it inserts the fairly unobtrusive text control links that allow you to scale the page text as large or as small as is comfortable to read on your display (something the noscript folks don't even realize isn't there). Without that element, the content layer wasn't being resized correctly.<p>I'm on your guys' side here. I know all the ""accepted ways""; I have to explain them to my clients when I justify the costs they're charged, and the benefits. Sometimes they want to know how many people this will actually affect, and I have to tell them, ""maybe a few"", and then try to justify doing it anyway.<p>And, it <i>is</i> harder to implement. I can build a site that will look exactly right no matter what size display you're reading it on; fonts and images will all scale, and the site will look right at 800x600 or 1600x1200, without lots of scrolling or empty space. The catch is, to do that, I need JS to work, and spending time trying to figure out the least ugly way to display the site sans JS is not ""not any harder"".<p>Feel free to browse my page source, it's fairly easy to read, if unconventional in places.",1284456135

I'm not saying it's worse in the long run (although I suspect you can't beat Java on Eclipse), but the overhead every time I want to try something new is large.<p>But the biggest problem with emacs is the ""project management"" functionality. Emacs is designed to be ""just an editor"". To do the most simple thing, which is to define a project consisting of a few directories, and be able to move between those files, is very hard. Pick up many modern editors, and you can, with one command, point to a directory and have a project tree, a ""jump to file"", etc, all built for you. Not to mention the way they create makefiles automatically, do code-completion, create tag files so you can jump to a function by name, etc.<p>I can just list the number of things I didn't have to know about before starting emacs: makefiles, tag files, etc. <i>Not</i> having to worry about these kinds of things is the biggest feature emacs is lacking.",1284455439

These days with the kind of tools and frameworks (springsource.com, jquery.com) and CMSs (refinerycms.com, drupal.org, firerift.com) can allow you to build a fairly powerful web app in next to no time. Couple this with the advent of Google App Engine and other cloud based app servers, the whole pain of setting up a linux server and configuring an app server on it is gone.<p>Already, you don't need any operational skills any more to host a production grade web-app (think load balancing, failover, etc).<p>The key I have realized is to depend less and less on outside technical help and more and more on yourself and your own technical tinkering abilities.<p>Once you've deployed your first app and have managed to get at least a few repeat users you will be surprised how many developers will be ready to help you further.<p>Just dive in with the implementation.. you will be surprised how much can be executed in a day by just doing it.",1284455382

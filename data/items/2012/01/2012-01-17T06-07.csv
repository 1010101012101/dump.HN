And why now, if some American legislators appear to be in tactical retreat on SOPA?</i><p>> <i>The reality is that we dont think SOPA is going away, and PIPA is still quite active. Moreover, SOPA and PIPA are just indicators of a much broader problem. All around the world, were seeing the development of legislation seeking to regulate the Internet in other ways while hurting our online freedoms. Our concern extends beyond SOPA and PIPA: they are just part of the problem. We want the Internet to remain free and open, everywhere, for everyone.</i><p>> <i>On January 18, we hope youll agree with us, and will do what you can to make your own voice heard.</i>",1326783494

I learned about Kickstarter at the time the Diaspora project was there collecting money. It was clear that people are not ""buying"" but ""investing"". They were not ""consumers"", they were ""investors"". Diaspora wasn't a ""product"" on ""pre-order"" but a ""project"" which was ""under development"". How the intent and purpose of the site changed in the minds of both ""backers"" and project makers is just amazing. Its like the identity of what Kickstarter started out to be has been lost somewhere.<p>Kickstarter was supposed to replace angle investors and VC. They were supposed to help the little guy start up without all the control of the big guy who had money. The idea, as explained to me on this very forum, was that this was crowd sourced investment. The users here went on to say how this will change the startup culture and help people start more bootstrapped startups without any strings attached. The ""rewards"" were never a guaranteed thing. They were sort of a thank you and giving out rewards were supposed to be a way to show off that they actually succeeded. Now it seems the whole thing has shifted to a marketplace of sorts. It seems like people are using it as an alternative to ebay or amazone, just that they can have higher flexibility and more contact to their ""consumers"". The inherent risk of ""investing"" has been lost and given way to the guarantee of ""buying"" a product.",1326783204

We would often have to get up to speed on very diverse industries and their core metrics overnight, and wikipedia was the first source that was available and easily searched.<p>With the English site black out, this will affect the world far more than just America.<p>As a matter of fact this is probably something that we should study and be prepared for.<p>How do the other data/encyclopedia sites fare during the black out? Is there a real effect, how long does it last?<p>What is the impact on non US visitors? Shouldn't the black ideally focus on people from the States?<p>Heck actually, this will probably offend a lot of people who aren't in the states - Indian sites can easily spin this as cultural propaganda (for example).<p>The more I think about it, the more the point raised higher up in this thread (regarding neutrality) starts bothering me.<p>A complete black out of the English Wikipedia is (hopefully) a once in a life time event. Considering the diversity of people who come to the site and the different cultural baggage everyone brings, this action will have far more repurcussions than just SOPA/PIPA.<p>While time zonal differences should mitigate this effect, the blackout should not affect visitors from countries where SOPA makes little difference.",1326782979
3474039,comment,3473538,3473662,3,0,nirvana,,,"I hate to disagree with you, but we already have a constitutional amendment, as well as the key text of the constitution itself.  The federal government is not given the power to pass whatever legislation it wants, so long as congress votes in favor, and the president sign and the supreme court doesn't strike it down.<p>I know this is the perspective most people have, but the reality is the constitution strictly limits what the government can do.  This specification is known as the ""enumerated powers"" clause of the constitution.<p>Much of what government does now- from the FCC to the FDA is not authorized by in the enumerated power.  If it isn't authorized then it is illegal, under the document that enabled the creation of these branches of government in the first place.<p>I don't think there's a higher form of the word ""illegal"" than that.<p>Further, and to really put the boot behind this point, the First Amendment itself says:<p>""Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""<p>This means the congress doesn't have the enumerated power, and further it is explicitly forbidden from, passing laws that allow the government to silence websites.<p>If a website is engaging in trademark infringement or copyright infringement, they are naturally liable in civil court.  But that doesn't give the government the power to shut them down (other than them losing a civil case that takes all their funding, or whatever.)<p>If any of these sites have a blog, then blocking the DNS or taking other actions to restrict access to that blog is a violation of the constitution.<p>Further, there's Federal Law on this issue-- US Code 18-242, which makes it a crime (a felony if armed) to violate someone's constitutional rights ""under color of law"".  Which means the government agents who enforce these ""laws"" are also criminals.<p>But the idea that a law could be illegal, and that government employees enforcing them could be criminals is just beyond the comprehension of most people.  They seem to believe, unlike the framers of the constitution, that the government <i>IS</i> the law.<p>And so they continue to get away with it and continue to expand their powers.",1326782977

There is basically no situation other than being in a shower where I don't have at least one 120+ lumen tactical flashlight, and no firearm-defense situation where I don't have a mounted light and/or handheld light.  I keep lights stashed by the bed, in my desk, by the door, in the car, etc. too.  Imagine an earthquake, fire, etc.!<p>The ""disorienting strobe"" mode of the novatac (or other tactical lights) is pretty much optimal (I think it's about 15Hz, 120+ Lumen).  I'm not sure how I'd use the fully programmable modes, except maybe to do recognition patterns with other users (although the standard for that is to have some kind of retroreflective squares in specific parts of your clothing, or IR reflectors and an IR light/NVD).  The one weakness of the fenix lights I have is the lack of the fast-strobe mode -- some of them have it, but it's harder to access, and a bunch of them don't have it at all.  With the novatac, it's a firmware/setting update.<p><a href=""http://www.novatac.com/downloads/data-sheets/20-0104C_120T.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.novatac.com/downloads/data-sheets/20-0104C_120T.p...</a> is the one I like the most, although I preferred the older design where the end switch was convex vs. flat (although you couldn't stand it on the endcap as a ""candle"").<p>The novatac is a little thicker, with a scallop in the back and an O-ring, and thus grips better in a syringe grip (which is useful in off-hand when used with a pistol in the other hand).<p>It also has a nice crenellated front, which the smaller fenix lights don't have.  I've broken auto window glass with one (it's not optimal, but works).",1326782973

I myself am a read-only C-like language user; only way I can keep myself interested is to fiddle with obscure corners of the spec and pushing the compilers, but hardly can I do any serious programming with them with a straight face.<p>For me to use a language seriously I must respect it. Having been a Lisper for 10 years, I simply don't respect the market languages out there. I have absolutely no confidence in their design choices, workflow, environment, or the engineering methodologies and tools they have spawned to compensate for their ills. They're palatable in snippets, but for creative flow and work from scratch, I will quickly convince myself to ""prototype"" in Lisp, and sometime later, end up deploying it in Lisp, or generating from it.<p>If it's not Lisp, then jQuery :-)<p>P.S.

One of the things I admire most about a few of the smartest people I have met is their ability to explain things in a very simple way. Furthermore, they are able to break down problems into very simple solutions. I definitely have troubles with doing this. Many of my solutions are complex. With quite a lot of effort, I am able to simplify the solution bit by bit, but when I talk to one of these people, their solutions blow me away. I always walk away saying to myself, ""Why didn't I think of that? It's so simple!"". I hope it's practice, and if I get enough, I'll someday be able to do what they do.",1276844056

I've worked for corporations before where someone else was responsible for cracking the whip, where he's only worked for himself, so it's been a challenge maintaining discipline.<p>We're using Redmine to help us keep track of the things and it's been helpful. The difficult part is trying to figure out what happens when we don't meet a schedule. Our client is pretty lax; we do a lot of things for them and have multiple projects for them. A lot of time is spent doing support for them and they seem to be pretty satisfied. Since they're are only client right now, we try to take good care of them.<p>That being said, we're not getting a lot of pressure from them to finish up this latest project ""on time""; they definitely want the features but since all the essential functions work, they don't put any pressure on us.<p>I want to move us towards a more rigorous and formal schedule with consistent release dates, etc. but I'm finding a hard time figuring out how to enforce discipline, not just for myself, but for my partner also. Any thoughts on this?<p>To give just a little more context, we're both studying language in Chinaâ€¦ so it's not like this is our only time commitment, but that isn't really a justifiable excuse for not releasing things on time.",1276843904

and c++ give you a lot of padding where you're writing boilerplate and
workarounds for not having closures, monadic values, a nice type
system, etc.  It could be relaxing in the same way that playing 3rd
trombone could be: you still get to play technical music every once
and a while, but you also get a lot of downtime to count rests and
listen to the music, or play whole notes.  There is a pleasure in
that, even if it's not the same as when you're in the 1st violin
section.  Music is still being made, problems are still getting

I remember that when Steve Jobs died there were more than a dozen submissions of stories about that major news event, and at least some users said that they flagged all of those stories, because they didn't want the whole front page of HN to be multiple stories from different publications on the same underlying news item. Please note that I don't do this. If a story is ""hot,"" I accept that as the news phenomenon of the day, and I selectively upvote whatever source(s) I think report the hot story best.

At least not for me.<p>The passing of time has always seemed to me to be more of a function of memory.<p>When I was younger, my memory was _much_ better.  And much more vivid.  It was in HD. I noticed by the time I was in high school that not only was my memory worse, but that it was of much lower quality.  Interestingly enough, though, I noticed that early memories, while less vivid than I remembered them, were often still more vivid than more recent memories. By the time I was in my 30s, things were much worse.  My doctor assured me that this was normal, and by the way, expect it to get worse still.<p>My father, who is now 96, can remember things vividly from 80 years ago and more, but can't remember what town he is living in at the moment.  He can remember chemistry and physics he learned long ago, but now he has trouble working the new flat panel TV we bought him. (This is only partly the fault of age, the UI experience on the TV is worse than abominable. Steve Jobs would puke.) This is interesting, because he _built_ the first radio that he ever owned, back in the 1920s.<p>The most heart breaking thing recently, is that my mother passed away a few months ago. She'd been with him constantly for the last 65 years or so.  And he keeps looking around for her, and then after a moment remembers she's gone.  He often doesn't remember the event, but it is still fresh as a state of being, even after several months.<p>So for my father time's passage seems instantaneous <i>and</i> never changing.<p>Duration is yet another issue.<p>Current time, you know, right <i>now</i>, passes for me at more or less the same rate.

I still think you might have a good point there not only due to that cellular slow-down, but also because I would certainly expect an increase in connection density, thus leading to longer computations.<p>I seem to recall an article from Joel on Software about the same phenomenon from a procedural point of view, where he compares increasingly complex institutional reaction times to the increasing amount of ritual that is being performed before we leave the house (with old people taking the longest time, because based on past experience of all things that went wrong in the past, their checklists before leaving the house become absurdly long over time).<p>Just an interesting side observation about the VLC speed thing: my personal sense of rhythm has always been so bad that I couldn't tell the difference between 100% speed then and 80% speed now. But an observation I recently made was that I can now comfortably listen to videos at 110% or even 120% their speed without losing content - something I certainly couldn't do at a younger age (in fact, I remember I often had to pause recordings in order to think about stuff that just happened or even just to empty my ""language recognition buffer"" before I could move on).

Children have one ""life thread"". Adults have a ton of them for various relationships, interests, and aspirations. For one example, since most people only get to spend about 2 weeks per year in the ""travel thread"", time from that perspective seems to go 26 times faster. If you have a summer house and show up in June and it feels like the last time you were there (September last year) was yesterday, that's what's at play. In that thread, it <i>was</i> yesterday.<p>Minute to minute, time seems to be going at the same rate. It's when you step back and take a macro perspective that there's a difference, because our lives accumulate complexity that we couldn't have imagined when we were children. Because our lives are a lot more complex, there are contexts in which 5 years isn't an eternity in the way it would be for a child, so from a macro perspective, long time durations aren't nearly as long.",1345340692

However, \n  when you are 50 years old, one year has reduced to only 2% of your \n  life, and hence seems only one-fifth as long.\n</code></pre>\nInteresting hypothesis, and he makes it <i>look</i> very scientific with the formulae and all, but it's still a wild crazy guess that delivers no actual falsifiable prediction. I think for claims of such magnitude, there should be a modicum of neurological or information-theoretical basis involved - instead we get to read repeated statements about how groundbreaking the idea is.<p>The article makes claims that at 30 life is essentially 3/4ths over which to me, while holding no subjective truth as far as I can tell, at least exhibit some self reference in the way that after three lines of statements the article's content seemed 75% over yet the actual text went on for much longer.<p>Subjectively time seems to go by faster the older we get, but that doesn't mean these bold claims are necessarily anywhere close to the truth. Personally, my relationship with time has certainly changed over the years, including the perception of a speed-up, but I also notice that some activities or states seem to last just as long (if not longer) subjectively as they did when I was 16.<p><i>My</i> pet hypothesis is there are multiple factors involved in ""the speedup"", and that a large factor of it would actually be that our brains don't store repetitive events very well. This would mean as we get more experienced, an increasingly bigger amount of the average day consists of things we already did many times before so we don't store those moments in memory. That would result in increasingly large memory holes over time, which our brains then glance over as they piece together our past - thus resulting in an apparent speed up.

I feel like this would have been more valuable if people had simply taken it as a lesson for success through tenacity. Here's what I take away from this: delivering the beer made the YC partners realize that Instacart was already up and running with a functional app, at which point it became a quasi-Pascal's Wager - if Instacart busts, it busts, but it looks like it could pay off big already, so why not bet on it? This is similar to how we got into YC with Light Table. Our initial application for a completely different idea didn't even get an interview, but when we applied late with numbers from Kickstarter to back us, it was a different story.

Ironically, even the military leans heavily on the side of initiative, if only because that's the only way you can effectively lead a large number of people. You only address the details that are important at your level in the chain of command. This takes dialogue and even a degree of pushback. You don't just say ""I want to fly this many sorties per day"" and punish people for not living up to that if it's unreasonable. They're expected to tell you it's impossible to maintain the aircraft on that kind of schedule.<p>There's also the separate issue of whether there's such a thing as non-negotiable orders. It seems clear to me that there has to be such a concept for any organization to work. It's even necessary for that to be the case in order for initiative and delegation to work. There will always be decisions made far above your pay grade, and the people who made those decisions can't delegate the details down the chain unless there's some assurance that the people down the chain won't deliberately sabotage the high-level decisions. That way lies politics and other bullshit.<p>In the OP's situation, <i>both</i> sides failed. The CEO made the high-level decision that 1:1's were mandatory. The VP's mistake was his failure to enforce the decision down the chain, and the manager's mistake was to silently ignore or disobey the decision. (If the manager disagreed and pushed back in the first place, it wouldn't have become a problem). When the CEO became aware that the manager was not holding the 1:1's, he was immediately forced to attend to details below his level. This wouldn't have happened had it been clear from the outset that the decision was not, at the present time, negotiable. By making that point, the CEO resets expectations and from then forward has regained the ability to delegate.",1345338812

Let me make a counterpoint, maybe someone can find holes in it:<p>Imagine Twitter supported OStatus.[1]<p>Anything going on between users signed up on Twitter would be instant just as it is now. Twitter could still have ads, and it could justify those ads by offering great features (OStatus et. al don't tell you what you can do, after all, they just restrict what you can share with other apps that implement it), and great speed.<p>Twitter users could then still subscribe to someone hosting their website from their crappy DSL connection; just <i>those</i> updates would be slower. And it would be up to that person to either get a really fast server, and/or pay for a CDN etc., or simply suffer the cost of the delay, and the fact that some people might not even subscribe to them because of that delay.<p>[1] Now image GitHub supporting OStatus.. Wordpress, forum software, <i>everything</i>. Why not? Turns out the content aggregator IS THE INTERNET, and the people who ""don't get it"" are those who desperately try to see it as a pie that can and should be carved up. But you cannot fool all the people all the time, and by the chain of logical fallacies based on wrong claims/assumptions, I <i>really</i> wonder what audience this is even aimed at. Hackers, or people with money/eyeballs?<p>We - and I don't mean ""hackers"", I mean most people if you asked the question straight - do not need or want middlemen for something as basic as communication or trust. That's what it boils down to. Just like everybody should be able to read and write and do basic math, everybody should at least have the option to have their own address on the web, without being forced into one of the gated communities.<p>There is a hope for an ironic twist: should protocols and DIY take off, Facebook and Twitter and others <i>better</i> support RSS, OStatus etc; because otherwise they'll just have walled themselves into a tomb, while we play in the <i>actual</i> garden. After all, a garden is where exciting things can happen, where people play games for fun, where they build crappy things with stones and branches and leaves, and where it's boring most of the time - in contrast, the alley is where people mistake drug addiction for fun, the mall where they mistake consumption for creativity, and the whorehouse is where the fun never stops. I know where I'd rather be. (no offense to prostitutes intended, I'm just running out of metaphors)<p>To finish my rant: in the wake of the app.net enthusiasm I often read that even 10000 users would be great if those were ""the right people"". Well, I will not ever be able to get to know, much less dedicate time to, even a 1000 people. So give me a network of 10000 people who are willing to read manuals and fiddle, if they can keep their independence and dignity that way. I don't mean hackers, I'll never be a good programmer myself; I mean people who are semi-intelligent and stubborn like me.

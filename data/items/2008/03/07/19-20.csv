There's RubyCocoa and PyObjc, both of which will most likely 10x their popularity in a yr after yesterday's announcement.  And no one is stopping anyone from making other obj-c bridges.  And remember, this is only the beginning, Apple may allow other platforms in years to come after they do more analysis of pros and cons of allowing them and after the iphone catches up to the PC computing power w/o the heat/battery issues.",1204919963
131440,comment,131129,131343,0,0,hwork,,,"Couple of thoughts: one, just because they've raised 11 million, doesn't mean that they've actually used all of it.  Granted, having 40+ employees (according to their About Us page), is a significant drain on their cashflow, but I haven't seen what their earnings are.  It's possible that they haven't used up their funding completely (or at all).<p>Two, I'm totally with you on the value to founders between taking lots of funding and getting a massive exit vs. taking a little bit of funding and having a lower exit.  It may not translate into two radically different paydays.  If anyone has any more insight into this, I'd be interested to know.",1204919894

131424,comment,131359,131359,0,0,willchang,,,"Devices always work on Windows first, and then drivers are eventually made for UNIX.  Software that make hackers productive are always first in UNIX, and then eventually ported to Windows.  A hacker who had to use one system for everything is faced with either the horror of having to use XFree86 or the horror of having to build an executable in Windows.  Traditionally people got around the problem by having a Windows PC for the devices and a UNIX server for getting work done.  With a Mac, you often get the best of both systems in one machine: devices just work, and compiling UNIX software is easy.",1204918747

Basically, I've used all sorts of things for years (going back to CP/M machines, via DOS and every flavor of Windows, SuSE, Fedora, Ubuntu, ... ) and the Mac is the right combination:<p>1. Stuff that I need to get done just works (e.g. sync my Bluetooth phone to address book, hook up to wireless networks, do backups)<p>2. Aesthetically pleasing.

131411,comment,131359,131359,0,0,iowahansen,,,"I'm generally a person that values function more than form, but I have to say it is a real daily joy to work on gorgeous hardware like a Macbook Pro. The reason Macs are more expensive because they only offer high-end hardware specs. A similar spec'ed Dell comes roughly at the same price. If you are hacker, always use the best tools there are. This is an invest in yourself.<p>Hardware aside, the real reason you should switch is OSX and the applications around it. Stuff just works. Sounds like a marketing message but its true. You can focus on accomplishing the task rather than wrestling with shortcomings and crutches of the environment. Application developers on the Mac also have the philosophy to integrate with existing services as much as possible, which makes a huge difference, because most of the stuff you use is able to talk to each other. Compare that to Windows where every application/service is its own island.<p>Imho, OSX is by far the best platform out there right now bar none. It's amazing to see how even non-hackers are blown away once they switch.<p>You should too.",1204917537

131408,comment,131359,131359,0,0,eugenejen,,,"I am speaking from hard customization aspect. I like MacBook better than MacBook Pro in this domain. It is relatively painless to replace hard drive and memory inside a MacBook. Of course I need to do some research to know the power consumption of hard drive and memory before I ordered replacement, so I can avoid overheat inside my MacBook. MacBook pro is great in its dedicated graphic chip and better range of view angle of its TFT display. But to replace a hard drive, it takes pain to remove all screws and lift up cables around the disk. And from what I read from Guy Kawasaki's blog, you can't return a beefed up MacBook back to Apple if you feel it is not what you want.<p>I went for MacBook because it is painless to add memory and upgrade disk. And I don't mind its less than perfect graphic performance and display because I use external LCD monitor when I can. It is smaller in size and light in weight so it is easier to carry around and it is 50% cheaper than MacBook Pro. I get what I paid for but also a little bit less hassle to mod it.",1204917336

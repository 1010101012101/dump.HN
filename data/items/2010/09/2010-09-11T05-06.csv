1681073,comment,1680397,1680397,0,0,papa,,,"When Google was considering the timing of its IPO back in 2003/2004, I remember reading about an SEC regulation that requires private companies to make regular public disclosures (10K filings) if they hit certain shareholder and asset thresholds. There was some speculation that this regulation may have played some part in forcing Google to go public sooner rather than later.<p>I don't know where/how it figures into Facebook's thinking, but it may be that the same issue may arise in which a private Facebook might face some of the public scrutiny a public corporation might and decide that if they must disclose, they may as well reap some of the benefits of going public.<p>For what it's worth, here's the specific reporting obligation I'm referring to as noted in a Wikipedia article (since I can't find it on the SEC website):<p>""Companies with more than $10 million in assets whose securities are held by more than 500 owners must file annual and other periodic reports, regardless of whether the securities are publicly or privately traded.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_10-K"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_10-K</a>",1284184245

I co-founded a company with a friend that became successful without the aid of any investors. We are trying to branch out and try new ideas.<p>The problem:
Unfortunately, we haven't had the pleasure of having any kind of guidance such as the guidance I hear so much about when people are funded by Y Combinator. My co-founder and I are both technical people that have worked for large corporations and haven't really had to think about the business aspects of the industry much, until recently . With some of our new ideas, we are now utterly at a loss on how to handle issues such as preventing launches from being emulated, attaining copyrighted content, whether to raise money through investors, etc.<p>So should I be looking for a mentor or a business partner who knows ""business""? Where would I find such a person?",1284183877

One of Flamarrion's points (cited in the French slate) was precisely that you cannot identify the author responsible for much of the text in Wiki.<p><i>Huh?</i> You can identify the author for Wikipedia text in greater and finer detail than for pretty much any other text ever created, down to the character and second. The name of the author may not be familiar to you, but it is a name regardless; the name on the cover of a book isn't trustworthy either, and Wikipedia is actually superior in that there is no 'Anonymous' (every contribution is linked to a pseudonym or an IP address, the latter of which can convey remarkable amounts of information).<p>I feel as if someone had come up to me and asked me, 'What if Shakespeare's plays were not written by William Shakespeare but by another man of the same name?'<p>Also, when Tiger Woods deletes 10k articles just to be <i>sure</i> that the content is clean from a copyright perspective (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents/CCI#Implementing_bot.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_not...</a>), then you may peddle your specious analogies.",1284181828

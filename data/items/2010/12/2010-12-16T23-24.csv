It's too open, what role are the ""software companies"" selecting a candidate for? What skills did the self taught applicant teach themselves? Which university course and how successful, what industry experience if any comes with it?<p>Generally I'd say a good degree shows rigorous study, flexibility a certain amount of persistence.<p>University graduates are often self-taught in many aspects - a degree however comes with a transcript given a brief overview of what the applicant should know and the level of their ability. To get this from a completely self-taught applicant without formal qualifications you'd need to test them thoroughly; why do this when you can choose from pre-tested stock.<p>As a complete outsider, the relationship between computer science and most software to me looks like that between physics and mechanical engineering.<p><i>I'm nowhere near being an IT employer, or computer scientist I just like sticking my oar in</i>.",1292543955

2014444,comment,2010208,2012970,0,0,usaar333,,,"Several points:<p>1) It feels like you are exaggerating population densities.  Outside of some ultra high density areas in Manhattan, you aren't going to have 100,000 people in a few blocks.  The density of most cities is about 3 to 4x that of suburbs, not orders of magnitude greater. (Note: I'm going off Bay Area data here).<p>2) Agreed on environmental costs not being accounted for.  Developing suburbs would cost more if they were; how much I can't say.<p>3) On your thought experiment, here's something to think about: The entire world's population can fit in Texas (270,000 sq miles) at density levels found in SF neighborhoods.  You'd need just over 3 Texases (or a Texas + Alaska) to do suburban density levels (~900,000 sq miles).  But you would need about 19+ million sq miles for farming (russia + canada + us + china + brazil); in other words,  the land use savings gained from going fully urban is a rounding error.<p>3a) On top of that, you already have to build out roads, wires, etc. to get to the farmland.  When also given that the land everywhere can absorb some waste with little effect (septic tanks), it actually is efficient to spread the population more evenly throughout this hypothetical world.<p>4) Again the cost does matter.  The interstate highway system has a lower cost per person and higher average utilization per person (defined as US residents) than San Francisco's Central subway does per person (SF residents).    Ongoing maintenance still looks the same; San Francisco needs to spend about $51M a year on road maintenance. Sunnyvale is at $4.7M with a 6th of the population and a 3rd the density.  There might be some resources saved in higher density, but something is dragging the per capita costs higher in highly dense areas.",1292543825

It means that they got some utility out of reading them, and it means that they thought others would too.</i><p>Assuming the theory works. People may upvote for a number of reasons, not necessarily because they received value from the link. There remains a lot of work to do in the unexplored space of social, user-powered spaces like Reddit and HN. In theory, the upvote/downvote method maximizes utility of the site users, because those who received value from the article upvoted. Unfortunately, what maximizes utility for one set of users isn't the same for others, which is why we can have such a diversity of sites like HN, Reddit, and Digg.<p>HN has established itself as a high quality, technically and entrepreneurially oriented site, which is why we don't see the same content as say, reddit.com/r/funny. Defending this position by submitting and upvoting high quality links is critical to maintaining the caliber of HN. This is part of why I don't like seeing resubmitted or duplicate content. Duplicate content (even if very high quality) still takes up a valuable front page location. If enough of the community received new value from the piece (ie. haven't seen it before), then they can upvote it and the article can stay. On the other hand, if you upvote something you've already seen for the benefit of others, you aren't necessarily helping them out. Instead, you are tampering with the ranking algorithm.<p>If enough new users see an old article and upvote it, then the utility for the aggregate user is maximized, and I am happy with duplicate content when this happens, even if I'm not receiving any value.<p>Still, there is the problem of users new and old not seeing or knowing about these great quality articles from years ago.

2014302,comment,2012632,2012632,0,0,giberson,,,"I think Scott needs to re-engineer his idea virus, it's not quite on the mark. Ultimately, it will only ever (at best) end up as a famous quote like ""Give peace a chance"" for similar mentioned reasons, but also because the virus doesn't offer immediacy. It's not something that an individual whose been infected with the virus can act on, rather it's something that will ultimately require collective action on. To be more power, Scott should revise the idea virus such that the transfered idea is something simple, and can be taken on by an individual that will ultimately lead to the end of war.<p>I'll leave the revision to Scott himself, but I will offer an example.<p>For instance, if my goal is to ultimately solve cancer:
A simple catchy saying ""Donate $1 today, Write it off Tomorrow -IRS."".<p>The idea is catchy because it implies personal benefit as a direct compensation. ""Writing it off"", hell every one wants a way to reduce how much money gets sucked up by taxes every year. To imply that being generous, we can alleviate some of our tax woes, the idea gains traction with people. Of course, the truth is you need a certain net amount of donations to really write it off, and even if you do, you don't gain any money you simply choose where it is spent--the over all net result is still a loss. But that simple matter isn't caught by those rational filters.<p>Obviously, the idea doesn't constrain what is donated to and as such could be donated to some opensource project not even related to cancer research. Nor would a single dollar donation likely benefit any cause, much less cancer research.
However the net effect of the idea, is an overall increase in charitable giving. More money is given, by more people, as the idea spread. The best part about the idea is the immediate positive feedback. Unlike Scott's initial ""Education is the antidote of war"", an idea like ""Donate $1 today, write it off tomorrow"" is more likely to spread and achieve it's ultimate goal.<p>I think Scott should revise his approach by simply adding a fourth trait: An idea virus must be actionable on the individual level.",1292541258

That takes significant time and money. Having the code is just a small part of it.<p>A smarter thing to do would be to campaign for the (public) data to be released as a huge data dump, ready for people to run their own analysis on (an Amazon Public Data Set for example). This too has plenty of problems though - under what terms should that data be licensed? People's bookmarks belong to them - would they be happy with their contributions being released as part of a massive data set for anyone (including sploggers) to do anything they liked with it?",1292540628

There were many, many more dupes being found than I expected.  Checking the robot's output before confirming the posting took about the same amount of time as it used to take finding fewer, but doing it by hand.  Fully automating it would only take a little more work, and maybe I'd then get the time back.<p>2. I was reading a bit more, but I found that the additional material wasn't interesting.  I was probably already reading everything I found useful, interesting, instructive, or engaging.  I'm working on a script to help me with that as well.<p>The problem I'm finding is the sheer volume, and most of it is repeats, politics, repeats, TSA, repeats, wikileaks, repeats, Assange, repeats, <i>etc.</i>  The proportion of material with deep technical content is much less than I remember.  Consider - as I write this anything older than 40 minutes old has already fallen off the ""newest"" page.  At that pace it can't all be worth reading.<p>It's suggested that newcomers read the ""news"" page, and perhaps the ""over"" page so they get enculturated with what this site is about.  Similarly, it's suggested that older hands inhabit the ""newest"" page so we can vote up those things that deserve it, and flag the inappropriate.<p>But I can't keep up with ""newest"" any more, and much of what I would find interesting is vanishing before I can find it.  Searching deeper will find it sometimes, but the 'bots were intended to help.<p>So I'm working on trying to help, working on trying to find the good stuff (by some definition), and working on adding value.<p>So, for what it's worth, that's what I think.  I hope it sparks off some interesting or useful thoughts.",1292540580

A reusable component of HTML and CSS that can be inserted without inheriting anything from the parent elements. You can achieve this if you take a lot of care, but it should be a lot easier than it is.<p>But where CSS really falls apart is in layouts. What is just a simple equation in a native application ends up being a myriad of hacks to get things flowing right in CSS. Javascript comes with the missing pieces, but introduces its own set of problems if you try to rely on it.<p>>  the difficult of writing core graphics methods for every bevel, rounded corner, gradient etc has a lot of developers just using cut images for everything.<p>On iOS, the QuartzCore framework provides declarative methods for those common style choices (rounded corners, gradients, etc.).",1346122696

There is no control group, and the study is retrospective.<p>A reader may ask how this result could arise by something other than a cause-effect relationship? Maybe people find themselves under peer pressure to (a) smoke pot, and (b) reject the value of scholarly activities. Someone might answer that IQ is predetermined, that it doesn't have any environmental component. But that idea has been falsified in animal studies, studies that show the development of new brain cells in animals that live in stimulating environments.<p>There are any number of factors that might lead an individual to simultaneously choose to smoke pot and avoid activities that might improve his IQ -- socioeconomic, genetic, and so forth. The only way to control for these things is to design a truly scientific study that <i>tells</i> experimental subjects whether they will smoke pot, rather than <i>asking</i> whether they do. But such a study would be unethical, which is why there's no science in this field of study.<p>This study is much like thousands of studies I've read over about 35 years, and all of them suffer from the same flaw -- they aren't science.

I've half-heartedly done a bit of research from time to time about Kindle DRM, but always give up after (perhaps incorrectly) confirming that it is still mostly the default, and after finding pages and pages of results of blog posts bemoaning or defending some DRM related news from last year, or two years ago, or four years ago.

The back-story you're missing is that, up until about 1980, it wasn't uncommon for people to stay at one company for 20+ years, even after they'd essentially ruined their reputations and were regarded as failures, because it was so disastrous and rare for people to actually get fired. So for companies to have 10 or 20% that was obvious deadwood was not rare. By ""deadwood"" I don't mean people who tried hard but took a long time to onboard or who worked on unlucky projects and could be rehabilitated, but I mean people who showed up at 11, left at 4, and might do no real work other than showing up for a couple meetings per week and making it obvious through inane comments that they didn't understand what was going on.<p>The first year of rank-and-yank, few objected to most of the firings because the people let go were the obvious nonparticipants, and it was better to get rid of them than lose the whole company. By the second year, it was more tense. By the third and fourth years, it was an outright morale-killer. It turns out that the percentage of people in a company who deserve to be fired isn't a constant.",1346121144

The choice has massive implications for people using that software - I've seen many a review of weeding all GPLv3 or AGPL dependencies out of a product for this very reason.<p>The original point is that Cory seems to think that protecting user's freedoms first requires securing device owner's freedoms, though the two come into conflict regularly, and he doesn't have clear answers of how to resolve that.

This is much like new languages, frameworks or patterns coming out and then papers being written about them.<p>During the middle ages you would hear almost only intervals of an octave or a fifth. Then with classical music came the third and the sixth intervals and the second and seventh intervals only made it a few centuries later. Music as a theory evolved over thousands of years. Only recently did it explode with jazz trying to find every single way to bend that theory.<p>The brain cannot easily play with a concept it has no single-word name associated to. Right now CS is full of concepts described by mini-phrases and no clear hierarchy for all of these concepts. Music theory by contrast can be entirely described starting from the major chord.

We run `yo genesis-wordpress` on our existing project, and adjust to make sure we can `vagrant up` to work on it locally, then PR it down to `master`.
2. We have an existing server running on a shared machine (&quot;old&quot;).
3. We run `cap old genesis:down` to download the old DB & files.
4. We create 2 new servers: &quot;staging&quot; on our company cloud, and &quot;production&quot; on Rackspace Cloud (NOT Chicago datacenter!) or AWS, then run `cap staging genesis:provision` and `cap production genesis:provision` to install the LAMP + Varnish stack.
5. Then, we send out `master` via `cap staging deploy` and `cap production deploy`.
6. Finally, we complete our migration with `cap staging genesis:up` and `cap production genesis:up`.<p>I don&#x27;t know how many other people are migrating and destroy/creating sites like we are (when we significantly change our PHP/Varnish setup, we just move cloud servers), so it may be worth creating a couple videos or screenshot guides showing this off.<p>Being able to `cap old genesis:down` and `cap production genesis:up` to migrate machines is pretty awesome to me.",1381463547

6531315,comment,6528969,6530582,3,0,vinceguidry,,,"Of course it&#x27;s always easier. The question is, can the business afford to wait while you greenfield another app? Usually it can&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why refactoring.<p>First step is fixing the development environment / build process and getting a staging server up. It will inevitably be broken / nonexistent, with frequent edits directly to production necessary. The last guy will have internalized a great deal of operational workarounds that you&#x27;ll need to rediscover then codify into the app.<p>Next you write tests. There will be none. Once you have a workflow that is decent, you can start to identify the worst offenders. All the while, you&#x27;ll be having to change the codebase to meet project requirements, this will give you a good idea of where the really bad shit is. Unit test all of it, and if you&#x27;re feeling froggy, write some integration tests. Once you get to this phase, you should be unit testing your project work.<p>Only after those two are completed can you start refactoring. Treat it like TDD. Keep an eye on larger goals like 12 factor conformance. It may look pie-in-the sky at first, but it will give you ideas on what to focus on. Main advantage of refactoring over ground-up re-writing is, you don&#x27;t have to sell it to your boss. You just do it, in and around normal project work.<p>The biggest hurdle is the first step. It&#x27;s scary to fuck with deployment. The approach I&#x27;ve come up with is to fork the codebase and rebuild the tooling on top of that, deploying first to staging, then to production, alongside the current working copies. Once you&#x27;re satisfied flip the switch. You may have to flip it back, but at least it will be easy and instantaneous.<p>These lessons are from my ongoing project to modernize an ancient Rails 2.3.5 website running on Debian Lenny. Linode doesn&#x27;t even offer that OS anymore, I had to cannibalize a server with an EOL app on it for a staging environment. I can&#x27;t use Vagrant because there aren&#x27;t any Lenny boxes.<p>It&#x27;s long, arduous and slow. I fucking love it.",1381462936
6531314,comment,6530536,6531265,2,0,malandrew,,,"Agree. However I&#x27;d say that for technology (software and maybe now hardware), consumer to enterprise is the new normal. Meteor for example is going this approach. Individual developers are not exactly consumers, but before a platform is ready for production most users are tinkerers, which in my mind is a consumer that is part of the maker movement. Eventually those maker consumers help take something to maturity where it eventually gets adopted by the enterprise. With the Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone, I think we&#x27;re going to see consumer hardware startups mature and at least one will be a huge hit because it&#x27;s a consumer tech hardware company that ends up having enterprise tech hardware relevance.<p>I&#x27;d say that the biggest change in the enterprise space is that individuals are increasingly responsible for purchases as opposed to some centralized purchasing department. Grassroots IT is the only adoption strategy with an element of virality.",1381462930

I&#x27;m itching to get back in at the ground floor at a startup (I&#x27;ve had previous success), but not sure where to start as most of the &quot;small&quot; company opportunities that come my way are pre-IPO companies that are already hundreds of employees deep. Due to previous career success, I am in a position where immediate compensation is not as important to me as finding an opportunity I am passionate about. I want to be given a mandate to help shape innovation strategy at a very early stage.<p>What I have to offer is three-fold:<p>1. Nearly fifteen years of technology Product Management experience, including the perspective and lessons that come from helping build a successful startup in the past, as well as managing successful enterprise products and most recently a $2 billion dollar Consumer software business.<p>2. I&#x27;m really interested in innovation as a discipline and would like to put into practice a framework for discovering the hidden underlying needs that can catapult an &#x27;ok&#x27; technology into a world-class success. Net-net, if given the mandate, I believe that I can save a startup from going through years of costly &#x27;fail-fast&#x27; pivots.<p>3. Because of previous startup success, I&#x27;m in a position that I can accept some ownership in lieu of initial salary, if the situation is right: i.e. focus on innovation is a major priority and I believe in the cause.<p>How might I find early stage startups in the Bay Area who&#x27;d be interested in exploring a potential relationship?",1381461372

Articles titled &quot;How I spent $32k with AWS, a for loop, and a simple typo&quot; or something like that.<p>Normally when I learn something new, I learn by tinkering  and breaking stuff.  I don&#x27;t feel comfortable doing that with AWS.  I&#x27;m hoping people will tell me I&#x27;m way off base because  this fear has stopped me from getting the ball rolling.",1421891978

There&#x27;s &quot;transport&quot; infrastructure that allows people who already know each other to communicate and there&#x27;s &quot;audience&quot; infrastructure that provides a way to present ideas to a group of strangers.<p>Holding providers of &quot;audience&quot; infrastructure accountable means that the only unorthodox groups that can communicate as effectively as the orthodoxy are groups with members that can provide &quot;audience&quot; infrastructure. Now the unorthodox suffer a disadvantage. The purpose of this system is to prevent <i>dangerous and harmful ideas</i> from being spread. This is still censorship.",1421891945

8927079,comment,8926316,8926999,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"IME, AWS is slower to set up initially. Since you are starting out with it, I&#x27;d say it will take longer to do things &quot;the AWS way&quot;. This article should help quite a bit with that part.<p>The real trick with AWS, IMO, is figuring out what you want to do yourself vs what you want to have hosted. For example, they offer a hosted cache such as memcached or Redis. For my app, I run Redis myself as it required roughly 15 minutes of work total to set up and maintain in 2014. OTOH, that&#x27;s not nearly the case with Postgres. I spent a day and a half tuning the version I host, switching to RDS, then switching back because RDS was too slow (even though by the specs, it was using a more powerful VM than the EC2 box I was running my instance on).<p>Basically, once you grok AWS, things become more productive AND you don&#x27;t need to spend time on doing things like setting up VLAN&#x27;s, transferring data between boxes, etc. You can do cool things like detach a virtual disk from one VM and attach it to another, rather than pushing 100 GB&#x27;s of data over a network. This, AFAIK, is not something that Linode or Digital Ocean can do.<p>Having said that, DO is great for lots of things. It&#x27;s a good place to experiment and to run lots of really small things. For me, that&#x27;s side projects or things that I am trying out before thinking about moving them to the &quot;big iron&quot;.",1421891919

Any\nplatform that has the ability to load code also has an opportunity to\nbind <i>platform</i> and thereby inform macros of target.

Of course I could read the letter charts in the doctors&#x27; offices and in the driving license office.

It is derived from a technology called Surface Renewal that measures the turbulent transport of mass and energy from the planetary surface to the atmosphere.  The concepts behind Surface Renewal were first developed in the 1930s by chemical engineers. These chemical engineers developed a model to describe the movement of gases into liquid media by fluid volumes interacting with the air-liquid interface. In the 1990s, UC Davis researchers adapted the Surface Renewal concept  to the planetary surface-to-atmosphere interface. Recent improvements in the technology enable Tule to measure the amount of water vapor carried away from  crop field by wind eddies.<p>Our technology was validated for accuracy against the gold standard research tools used in academia, lysimetry and eddy covariance.<p>What truly makes our technology exciting is that we can tell farmers the optimal amount of water to apply to maximize plant growth (yield) and plant stress (quality). Studies have shown that getting irrigation right can radically change yield and quality. Before our technology, farmers have never had the feedback to optimize irrigation. This is analogous to NewRelic locating the bottlenecks in your server performance. You can&#x27;t optimize until you can measure.<p>edit:<p>As requested, here are links to the technology:<p>An easy to read summary is here:<p><a href=""http://edu-tuletechnologies-com.s3.amazonaws.com/Tule_Surface_Renewal_Background.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edu-tuletechnologies-com.s3.amazonaws.com/Tule_Surfac...</a><p>The original academic paper is here:<p><a href=""http://myweb.ecu.edu/suh/PawU1995.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myweb.ecu.edu/suh/PawU1995.pdf</a>",1421889887

How would you define consciousness? I define it simply as my current feelings, perceptions, thoughts, etc. By this definition, only one consciousness exists. Consciousness is the only thing one can be sure about. When I feel pain, it&#x27;s a non-disputable fact that I have this unpleasant feeling. But I can&#x27;t be sure about anything else, for example the physical laws (they can change tomorrow). Or you can wake up from a Matrix - actually absolutely anything can happen.<p>How would I define pain – it&#x27;s sort of a axiom (not sure how to express myself here) and it&#x27;s subjective. Objective definition that would allow you to test if someone is feeling pain doesn&#x27;t exist (or it would describe something else than the feeling of pain).

It fires them them at a half-silvered mirror. When a photon hits a half-silvered mirror, it randomly either reflects or passes through. The first half-silvered mirror splits the photon beam into two beams, labeled 1 and 3. Beam 1 hits a regular mirror, which sends it down path 2 toward another half-silvered mirror. Beam 3 hits a regular mirror which sends it down path 4 to that second half-silvered mirror.<p>At the second half-silvered mirror, photons coming in on path 2 can either pass through and be registered at detector B, or reflect and be registered at detector A.<p>Photons on path 4 can reflect into detector B, or pass through into detector A.<p>Start out with the source at high intensity, so we have a lot of photons, and can treat the light like a wave. The distances of the paths can be adjusted so that light on path 2 that passes through to B is out of phase with light on path 4 that reflects into B, and so we get destructive interference and B detects nothing. We get constructive interference on path 5, so all the light ends up at detector A.<p>Now, keeping the light at high intensity, block path 4 at the point labeled &quot;test point&quot;. Now half the light leaving the source takes path 3 and gets blocked at the test point. The other half of the light takes 1 and 2, splits at the second half-silvered mirror, and since there is no light on path 4 there to interfere, half of the light from path 2 goes to A and half to B. Net result: 1/2 the light lost at the test point, 1/4 detected at A, and 1/4 detected at B.<p>Now, leaving the block in place at the test point, turn the light source down so that it is emitting single photons, say a photon a second. What we will now find is that 1/2 the photons get lost (the ones that took path 3 and 4, and hit the block), 1/4 end up at A (the ones that took 1 and 2, then reflected at the half-silvered mirror), and 1/4 end up at B (the ones that took 1 and 2 and then passed through the half-silvered mirror).<p>So far, everything makes intuitive sense.<p>Now remove the block. Intuition says that we should have 1/2 the photons take 1 and 2, and 1/2 take 3 and 4. The photons, when they arrive at the second half-silvered mirror, should end up distributed equally to A and B. So we should see 1/2 the emitted photons at A and 1/2 at B.<p>What actually happens is that they all end up at A.<p>How can this be? We are somehow getting interference even though we are only sending single photons through!<p>This lets us do something remarkable. Suppose I have been playing with the equipment, and left it in an unknown state. You don&#x27;t know if I have the block at the test point or not, and it is inconvenient to reach the test point to check.<p>So you send a single photon through, and it happens to register at B. You can infer that I left the block in, because if I had taken it out, there would have been interference and the photon would have come out at A.<p>Think about that...the photon came out at B, meaning it did not hit the block, meaning it had to have taken that 1/2/6 path...but then how did it &quot;know&quot; that the block was in place so that it was &quot;allowed&quot; to randomly take 5 or 6 (and ended up taking 6)?<p>If you remove the block and then send one photon, and it takes 1/2, and then has to &quot;decide&quot; whether to take 5 or 6, how does it know that the block is gone and so that it is required to take 5?<p>It just doesn&#x27;t work to say that the photon takes a path, in the sense that it starts out at one place on that path, and as time goes forward it moves along the path.<p>If you want more information on this particular setup, Google for &quot;quantum bomb tester&quot; (the name comes from a hypothetical where you have a bunch of light sensitive bombs, but some of them have defective light sensors, and you want to find a way to figure that out without destroying all the working bombs, and this kind of split path setup provides a solution--letting you answer the question &quot;would this bomb explode if I hit it with a photon?&quot; without actually hitting it with a photon).",1421888461

I then start work (I can work any hours I like as long as I do the work). Frankly, it kind of sucks. I've always wished I could get up early, chipper and fresh but even when I was a little kid I couldn't (well, when I was 8 I could).<p>Even by the age of 10, when I had to get up at 5:00am to deliver a paper route, I was an absolute wreck in the morning. By the time I was a High School student I would essentially spend the entire first half of the day in a sleepy haze even falling asleep in the midst of taking tests (I would jump with a start and find pencil trails running down the sheet where I had passed out). Teachers would yell at me for sleeping in their class all the time.<p>No I don't have narcolepsy... I was tested. Most they came back with was I have mild sleep apnea but the stupid breathing machine they give you just prevents me from sleeping even more so I quit wearing it... so I could actually get SOME sleep. ARGH!!!",1237571863

Even though it sucks at first -- you may have trouble falling asleep and then getting up early you'll still be tired -- you have to muddle through to get on a regular sleep schedule.  Eventually, your body will adjust. Try not to deviate much at all.<p>(That's advice given to me by a sleep expert at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, RI many years ago, when I was afflicted with a rare sleeping disorder.)<p>She also told me never to do anything but sleep in my bed (don't read there, don't eat there, don't work, don't watch TV, etc.).  Beds are for sleeping and training your brain to recognize that will help you keep to your regular sleep cycle.<p>If you're having trouble falling asleep, get up, go sit in a chair and read for 15 or 20 minutes, then try going to sleep again.",1237571802

However, I don't think Apple is playing the position of scooping up customers who are 'underserved by Microsoft'.  They are playing the position of making intuitive, well designed products that anyone can use while locking you into their ecosystem.<p>Most users don't care about design?  I think the number of the different Apple products sold say otherwise.  A phone that anyone can pick up and use many of the features without reading a manual, thats a byproduct of brilliant design on many levels.  Whether people care or not, they connect with it and are put in a position where they now have feelings for a piece of technology.  When they then decide to make that purchase they very much care about design.<p>Microsoft products have indeed been successful, but other than the xbox (and we're talking consumer electronics here not OS's) what has been the other runaway hit they've made?  The zune is a great media player, but came about after msft assembled a team and put them in a room with an ipod and told them to make something better.<p>The growth in sales from Apples products combined with their increasing marketshare in the desktop and mobile spaces are very indicative of consumers demanding better designed stuff.  Apple's in-house iterative process is best positioned and most efficient at making products that are in line with that.",1237571771

What's good about it?<p>I wish the author at least postulated some reasons why Rails became popular:<p>* It launched before the other web frameworks of its nature (in fact, many were inspired by it).<p>* It hit API stability many years before Django did.<p>* It's a lot more flexible than most PHP frameworks.<p>* Ruby makes pretty, domain-specific languages easy.<p>* Rails, while allowing you to override defaults, doesn't ask you if you don't care.<p>* The features have kept coming in Rails with regular releases increasing its value.  Many of the additions have come from real-world, high-value projects.  That can't be said for many frameworks which were built as ""we can make Rails in (Java|PHP|Python|etc.)"".<p>Rails has hit a tipping point, but the interesting question is why.  The author hasn't put anything forward there.  In fact, the author has some downright weird statements.  He can't find anything bad to say about Django?  Rails just plain sucks?  Yet Rails wins?  Even some of the things he mentions - such as coupling data objects to the database - are done in Django (and most of these style frameworks) in a similar fashion. So, that sucks in Rails and doesn't in Django.  Hmm.<p>It's a great attempt to create one of those articles people love to read that say, ""this sucks, but it's still what you should be doing because it doesn't matter that it sucks"".",1237571555

At that time the economy was bad but the massive layoffs hadn't really started in earnest.<p>I had been toying with the idea of just leaving cold turkey but the logical/risk adverse side of me kept saying it wasn't a good idea since I had a great paying job at a solid company with excellent benefits.<p>But as the days wore on with me feeling like I was literally withering my life away I decided that it was time for me to crap or get off the toilet.  So I turned in my notice on the same day Obama was inaugurated (figured it was a nice metaphor for my life change).<p>I had a very similar situation as you, with a friend who had a lot of contract work he could farm to me.  This work pretty much paid all the expenses (I know PG doesn't encourage even doing this, but this was about as risk adverse as I could get comfortably).  The first day of not going into a cube was magnificent.  The second day, some shock set in, but now a month and a half later and I will say it's been a very good decision.  Work and opportunities are just piling in and I have a number of other business projects in the pipe.<p>Now I work really hard but I take time out to do what I want, when I want.  I go for a run after checking some email, I meet friends for long lunches, then I crank on code til 1am, and while I am doing more 'work' I feel like my life is much much more fulfilling.<p>I would say you're actually playing it more safe than many who have quit their job and you're in a great position to be successful and lead the life you want.<p>Hope this rambling helped in some way, and whatever you decide to do I hope you find success and fulfillment.<p>Cheers",1237571549

One example of this is the Dodge Viper.  It's been ~12 years since I was close to the process, but something like 80% of the Viper was built by various suppliers.  Those suppliers shipped the pieces to Dodge for final assembly, but the Viper factor was little more than a dozen guys with air ratchets.

I would be personally irritated if I was this guy's manager.<p>Coming across material like that when researching someone for a job would probably be a no-hire flag for me - and many others.  I'm sure he's a great designer, but does a post like that expand or limit the number of future gigs he might get?  You could say ""he wouldn't want to work at places like that anyway"", but I'd rather have that decision left to me rather than a lack of response when I'm looking for work.<p>Offering this in the spirit of advice.  I've been hiring people in the valley for 10+ years.  I used dejanews to screen applicants prior to google...  today yes we will read your tweets, find your blog, and skim it all to get a sense of who you are.

If a developer will never switch to Selenium then Selenium Grid (in its current state) is useless. TestSwarm is completely test suite agnostic - which is huge. I don't know of a single Open Source JavaScript projects which uses Selenium.<p>> Unless you right the appropriate daemon for those devices and integrate it into the existing Selenium Grid set up. Surely that's easier than starting afresh?<p>It absolutely is. There are no daemons in TestSwarm. It's a single URL that you can open in any browser. No 3rd party software is required to be installed.<p>> Huh? That's just bizarre. If you've got some new browser then reach Selenium how to start it. It's not that hard.<p>So the only solution for an unknown browser is to wait for the Selenium team to add it? That's unacceptable. New browsers must be added instantly and on-demand (which TestSwarm handles).<p>> This is solved by virtualization.<p>No it's not, not at all. A virtualized environment requires a few things: A machine on which to run it and enough resources to run as many virtualizations as required. As an Open Source project we don't have that sort of money.<p>Second, virtualization is insufficient for testing. Within the Mozilla project we've discussed problems with virtualization and how they are not always precise. Nothing is better than running the tests directly on an actual user's machine.<p>Third, virtualization does not solve the problem of manual testing. We want to get tests in front of users wherever possible - throwing them to some dumb server does nothing to help us.",1237568809

525177,comment,525067,525147,0,0,tsally,,,"True words.  A connection can be made to the programming.  It's generally accepted by programmers that there is no way to ""hack"" the process of becoming a really great programmer.  That's why it's obvious that the whole notion of ""[Persons] Teach Yourself [Enterprise Language] in [Unrealistic Time Frame]"" is just garbage.  Yet I personally had a hard time accepting that a good night's sleep wasn't hackable.  I've tried all the methods you can think of: various routines and schedules, etc.  When it comes down to it, like programming, it's something you can't hack.  Trying to hack a good night's sleep is much like trying to learn a programing language quickly.  True success requires effort and consistency, in the case of sleep, going to bed early.",1237568520

Come up with detailed tasks - code this function, debug this issue, write follow-up emails, etc. If the tasks are not defined, then it's hard to push yourself to wake up early in the morning.<p>Basically you need a reason to wake up in the morning. If we don't have reason, then even if alarm rings, we snooze it and procrastinate waking up at the decided time.<p>Do all brainstorming, planning, HN/news/blogs reading in the night. And decide a clear action plan for the morning.<p>2. Sleep early. One of my advisers sleeps at 10-10:30 in the night, and wakes up at 4am. I tried following same pattern, and it worked flawlessly. I used to get solid work done in 4am-8am before I go to my day job.",1237568418

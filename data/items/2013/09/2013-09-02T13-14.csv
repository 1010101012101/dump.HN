This investigative work granted them the Pulitzer Prize and led to the resignation of the president.</i><p>First of all, winning the Pulitzer Prize doesn&#x27;t validate journalism. It&#x27;s a prize given by journalists to journalists, and despite what the OP thinks of today&#x27;s investigative journalism, journalists are still giving each other Pulitzer Prizes for investigative work, so not sure why he uses it as some kind of metric.<p>Second, I&#x27;m not familiar with all the details of Watergate, but I don&#x27;t remember it being a scandal involving the Secret Service.<p>Details, details, I know.

I even learned to write at the same speed I wrote stuff in Italian, even if I hit a local minima in this regard, as you can see reading this post: basically I learned to write very fast a broken subset of English, that is usually enough to express my thoughts in the field of programming, but it is not good enough to write about general topics. I don&#x27;t know most of the words needed to refer to objects you find in a kitchen for example, or the grammar constructs needed to formulate complex sentences, hypothetical structures, and so forth.</i><p>Well, have you tried to properly study English, as in, with a teacher and a course book? From your description I understand that you merely tried to casually pick up English.<p>If so, it&#x27;s not particularly fair to assess the difficulty of English compared to your own language (that, besides, being your native language, you were taught it&#x27;s grammar and syntax for years on end at school).<p>I&#x27;ve studied English for several years and have no trouble speaking or reading it -- despite not having had many opportunities to speak it with native english speakers until much later in my life. Reading a lot of books/magazines/etc helps a lot. Reading for like 1-2 hours per day.<p>I found out I could pick a specialized subject I was interested in, like, say, electronic music production, and just by reading the magazines (Future Music, Electronic Musician, Keyboard etc) for a couple of years I could go from a total newbie to understanding all the specialized vocabulary used (from simple stuff, like &quot;knob&quot;, &quot;fader&quot; and &quot;slider&quot; to &quot;dither&quot;, &quot;LFO&quot;, &quot;frequency cutoff&quot; etc).<p>Watching movies and tv series without subtitles also helps tremendously. In Italy this is even worse, because they don&#x27;t just add subtitles, they usually dub the whole thing with Italian actors (ugh).<p>(OTOH, ho studiato Italiano per tre anni, in un gruppo picolo, e questo e tutto che lo ricordo, ho dimenticato quasi tutti gli parole e la majorita de la &quot;syntax&quot; e gli tempi -- damn, that got bad quickly)",1378130195

His accent is strong enough that it makes understanding him a bit tricky sometimes, and when I mentioned it, he said that this accent was part of his identity and he wouldn&#x27;t be trying to improve it. He was weirdly taken aback when I said something in a &#x27;good&#x27; French accent.<p>This attitude was really surprising to me.<p>For me, when speaking your non-native language, the aim should be to sound like a native (or with the accent of some subset of the native-speaking population).<p>I wonder how widespread this &quot;X is my native tongue, so I&#x27;m going to speak English in a strong X accent, because otherwise I&#x27;d be submerging my identity&quot; attitude is?",1378130193

If every penny spent on enforcing drug laws and incarcerating drug sellers and buyers were spent on education, treatment, and poverty programs, drug use would fall in the United States by orders of magnitude.<p>One of the more pernicious effects of making the sale and purchase of drugs illegal is that people who sell and purchase drugs are sent to prison.  Most people sent to prison for these offenses are themselves addicts either trying to feed their habit, or to pay for it.  These are the people that the drug laws are intended to protect, no?  But as a result of going to prison they:<p>* are frequently denied effective treatment for their illness, and therefore continue as addicts inside and outside of prison;<p>* are effectively exiled from the legitimate economy, becoming a burden on society both before and after incarceration, and increasing the likelihood of continued drug use;<p>* cannot take care of their families, increasing the burden that we all carry that we would not otherwise carry;<p>* are mixed with a violent element, whose influence will certainly cause many to commit non-drug crimes that they otherwise would not have.<p>The prisons turn users into addicts and addicts into career criminals.<p>Some people seem to believe that we need these harsh laws in order to catch, as you put it, &quot;cocaine pushers&quot; who are &quot;in the business of destroying people&quot;.  In fact, narcotraffickers are entirely the creation of US &quot;Drug War&quot; policies.  Decades of supply-side enforcement has made these people so wealthy that they can purchase entire governments.  The government of Mexico, the world&#x27;s 14th largest economy, is populated in some percentage at almost every level by agents of the cartels.  It is &quot;Drug War&quot; policies that create the profits to pay for this corruption.<p>Demand-side policies along with controlled and regulated distribution of drugs in the US will decimate the narcotraffickers.  Without customers willing to pay ridiculous margins for their product, they will simply go out of business.  Although some former narcos will attempt to leach off of society through kidnapping and other crimes, a lack of local community support, money and political cover will mean that aggressive policing will finally be able to stomp them out in time.<p>Also consider the case of Oxycontin, a legal narcotic manufactured by Perdue Pharma, &quot;a privately held pharmaceutical company founded by physicians and now located in Stamford, Connecticut&quot;.  Oxycontin is among the most destructive drugs today.  Oxycontin is primarily acquired by addicts either by getting doctors to legally prescribe it, or by purchasing excess pills from individuals to whom it was legally prescribed.<p>&quot;Drug War&quot; policies are entirely ineffective a combating this kind of practice; as a result, prescription drug abuse is growing at a faster rate than nearly all other forms of drug abuse.  However, it is almost certain that addiction-treatment regimes instituted to reduce the use of currently-illegal drugs will also be effective at reducing the illicit use of currently-legal drugs.<p>And if for some reason you think that education and treatment programs can&#x27;t have a significant (if not massive) effect on addiction rates, I would ask you to take a look at the following two data points:<p><a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/12/science/la-sci-sn-cigarette-smoking-kids-20130712"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/12/science/la-sci-sn-ci...</a><p><a href=""http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/drug-decriminalization-portugal-lessons-creating-fair-successful-drug-policies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/drug-decriminal...</a>",1378129250

The local ways of pronouncing words, can still continue in each region. There are probably many aesthetic considerations for this. But when two people across different regions speak, they can use this system.<p>This would require linguists to document the phonemes, and to find a minimal set of alterations of either the spelling or the pronounciation of a word so that you have a phonetic system. There are already variations in spelling (American/British English). This would be another variation which is phonetic.<p>Of course, even if this this work is done, it would still be yet another standard needing popular adoption. The phonemes would also be more in number than the current letters which means either using diacritic symbols (requiring change in keyboards, slower typing) or mapping a phoneme to multiple letters (longer spellings and possibly some ambiguity in detecting phoneme boundaries in spellings).",1378128362

At a certain point, I started making more than my parents. When that happened, my father asked for some financial support claiming that he was barely making ends meet (which had happened in the past when I was younger). He wanted me to send him $1000 monthly for what he initially said would just be 8 months. However, I kept making more money and he kept asking for the $1000 every month (the last tally i have is around 32 months). This went on to a point where they also asked for a house and really pressured me into buying one. At the end of the year, it ends up being a good sum of money that I give to then entirely tax-free on their end.<p>About a year ago, I left to go work on a startup as a cofounder. We bootstrapped the whole thing so there was no income other than money I had saved up so I stopped sending my parents the money and they understandably stopped asking for it. The company I bootstrapped didn&#x27;t work out so I&#x27;m again jumping back into the workforce and getting paid around what I was previously making and my parents are once again asking for money saying that they really need it (father works btw).<p>I know I&#x27;m well payed but I work very hard at what I do; but then again, its my parents that I&#x27;m helping and after all, I&#x27;m single and have no other obligations to take care of than myself.

I have less of an accent than both of them in their opposing language, but they both have a much stronger overall command.  Sometimes I meet someone with a very thick accent that is hard to decipher at first, but they speak very quickly and with excellent grammar and vocabulary.<p>So it&#x27;s clear to me that accent and language skills are orthogonal.  Many immigrants hit a wall with their accent because it&#x27;s good enough, and they get more added value from improving their grammar and vocabulary.  Clearly I think pg touched on the important point that entrepreneurs generally talk fast about complicated and novel ideas, so an accent is more likely to get in the way as compared to normal interactions.  However it&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg, and I think the average American lives a more sheltered life in terms of the reality of having to learn another language than any other country.",1378127752

This is an important point.  There are a number of things that native speakers of English can do to be more understandable to non-native speakers.  Some things I&#x27;ve found are helpful: speaking more slowly, shifting your pronunciation (especially of vowels) to be more standard, using different words (e.g. if you&#x27;re talking to a native speaker of a Romance language, prefer words with Latin roots over Germanic ones), and being careful to pronounce all consonants.  Things that rarely help: speaking more loudly and repeating the same phrase multiple times.<p>Making these changes to your speech in real time is a difficult skill that must be cultivated and practiced.  I would encourage native speakers to work at this skill, as it can make a big difference.  I was once speaking to a couple of Russians and an American from the same region of the US as me.  The Russians said they could understand me easily, but had difficulty understanding the other American.  The difference was that I was making an effort to speak more clearly for them.",1378127611

If so, this might be useful to you.<p>We&#x27;re preparing an infrastructure service for LDAP directories, similar to AWS&#x27;s Relational Database as a Service (RDS).<p>Why? Well, there are some compelling use cases for Directory as a Service. Here are a few examples:<p>1. Offloading the operation of non-production LDAP directories to a managed service. For example, any development or test directories that you would usually create and/or operate yourself.<p>2. Designing a cloud-first application that uses an LDAP directory as a data store. One of the most popular uses of LDAP is managing users and authentication (think Microsoft Active Directory) -- and for good reason. LDAP is optimised for searching, with very fast retrieval of users and other indexed objects.<p>3. Relocating an existing on-premise application to the cloud, where the application uses an LDAP directory as a data store. The benefits are the same as in the cloud-first use case.<p>While we&#x27;re in beta, we&#x27;re happy to spin up a free directory for you to try. The LDAP flavour is 389 Directory Server, which is the open source version of Red Hat Directory Server. You can apply for a free trial directory at http://try.ldap.io/beta<p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s currently planned on the roadmap:<p>- Administration dashboard
- Single tenancy
- Different LDAP flavours (OpenLDAP, 389 DS, OpenDJ, OpenLDAP)
- Scaling and replication (master-master, master-slave, provider-consumer)
- REST and JSON-RPC APIs
- Cloud agnostic infrastructure (AWS, Google Compute Engine, etc)
- Friendly web client
- Dead simple schema updates
- Premium support<p>We&#x27;d love your feedback, whether positive or negative. Thanks.",1378127459

859933,comment,859770,859909,0,0,pyre,,,"> <i>No, there's quite a lot more we can do. Foreign policy is all about influencing what goes on beyond your own borders.</i><p>My point was that he was acting like the Civil War was a 'war to end slavery world wide' and he almost comes off as surprised that a Civil War years-ago in the US hasn't affected the slave trade on the opposite side of the planet. The point of the Civil War (in terms of slavery) was to abolish the plantations and make the slave trade illegal (i.e. to 'free the slaves').<p>Abolishing the legal trafficking of slaves is one step in the process, obviously, but a major step nonetheless.<p>> <i>It was never the case for historic US slavery that the price of a slave was anything less than an investment.</i><p>This was mostly due to the cost of trafficking in the slaves. If I go down to Haiti the slaves that I could buy there aren't shipped from the other side of the world. If one wanted to buy a slave in Africa in the early 1800's I'm sure it would have cost you a lot less than right off the slave boats in the colonies. Even shipping a boatload of slaves around the world now would probably cost <i>a lot</i> less than it did then.<p>I guess what really irks me about this -- and my point -- is that presenting the low-cost of purchasing a slave today comes across as shock-value to get an emotional response. And the response that he seems to be going for is to get people thinking that globally humans have de-valued human life more now than in the past. My argument is that you can't compare the price of a slave in the 1800's to the price of a slave now and use the severe difference in price as proof that the people of the 1800's put a higher-value on human life.<p>> <i>(and I'm fairly sure nobody would be surprised to learn that there is less slavery per head of population than previously - but does that make it any less bad?)</i><p>Doesn't make it any less bad, but it feels very deceptive to use raw numbers like that without presenting relative numbers. It feels like they are trying to get people to reach the wrong conclusions, but with the right intentions.<p>> <i>I don't think human misery works on the calculus you're trying to apply. One million people in slavery are going to be fairly unhappy, whether they're embedded in a population of 50 million or 5 billion. If the number of people in slavery is increasing, that's bad, even if it's going down as a percentage.</i><p>Maybe the problem here is that I'm not mainstream enough to be the intended audience. I feel like I want to see all of the numbers, and when numbers are pushed off to the side, it feels very deceptive to me.<p>Aside from that, I feel that the best way to measure progress is whether or not the numbers are going down as a percentage. Especially compared to the percentage of population growth. If the number of slaves goes decreases by 2% and the population grows by 1%, I see that as a net win. I also think that it's unrealistic to think that we will ever get the number of slaves down to 0, though I would hope it's possible... even if it has to be on the long-long-term.<p>> <i>Do you really think that's what he's asking for?</i><p>He said: <i>He needs to hear from all of us that the true abolition of slavery needs to be a part of his legacy.</i><p>That comes off to me as <i>too</i> positive. That sounds like he thinks President Obama is going to abolish slavery. 'The true abolition of slavery' will not be part of Obama's legacy unless he actually abolishes all slavery.<p>I'm all for better foreign policy regarding slavery, don't get me wrong, but I thought that this guy's message was too positive. Better US foreign policy regarding slavery is a win as long as 1 slave gains freedom over it, but I daresay that foreign policy alone might not make a dent in world-wide slavery for at least a decade (though I'm really pulling that number out of nowhere; feel free to contradict me).<p>In general, I'm not disagreeing with the need to combat slavery. I'm disagreeing with some of what this guy is saying because it's coming across as deceptive (even though the intentions may be good) and too overly optimistic (I believe in setting realistic goals).",1254653331

859920,comment,859686,859686,0,0,kevbin,,,"The article overstates CA's response to its problems. The slashing and ""vast numbers"" aren't enough to right the ship and are pretty minimal compared to private industry, or even other state governments. The response of state employees and their unions to furloughs (walkouts, infighting, demands for still higher taxes) demonstrate seriousness hasn't set in.<p>Booms and busts define the state, long before the housing or internet bubbles, there was the gold rush, the oil boom, the space race, the PC revolution, you name it. There's always another boom to cover the last bust—this time, too.

If so, the feds and everyone else can bail us out, like they do the rest of the nation's problem children (banks, farmers, automakers, savings and loans, tire makers, steel producers, railroads…), leave us to our booms and busts, enjoy the gravy when times are good and let us live in their basement strumming our guitar when we screw the pooch.<p>But, Uncle Sam's not much better off. He's just running on a slower pace. Long enough in his basement and he'll start to see how alike we really are—right around the time he gets foreclosed on. Our federal system has a seriously great architectural basis, but it's an 18th and 19th century design burdened with two centuries of gnarly patches and tweaks hacked together in two-year bursts by groups of 535 glad-handers and administered by a nameless, faceless, unrepresentative bureaucracy. As the nation scaled-up, the exquisite balance of republic and democracy struck by the founders turned into an opaque, incomprehensible, unfair, inefficient, ineffective cancer. Some major refactoring needs to be done. CA, having the same issues, will serve as a proving-ground for reforming the whole country.

859919,comment,859622,859893,0,0,gaius,,,"But I do get it. Marriage means different things to different institutions. To the couple themselves, it's about love. For the Church, it's about God's will. For the government, it's about a steady supply of new citizens. For most of history - perhaps even still - a single woman with a young child is not a viable economic unit. A couple is.<p>The third point is the one that's being contended here. All the legal aspects of marriage - tax, immigration, inheritance, etc - were put in place by the government in support of the government's interest in marriage. If there are no kids involved, it's not at all clear why the government should offer the perks.<p>As for the other points, the first I have already addressed and the second is only relevant if you really want to get married in a church, and like I say, you can hold the ceremony on a beach if you want to.",1254651355

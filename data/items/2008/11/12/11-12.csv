I looked at it, decided I needed to re-install, and told her that I wanted to put Ubuntu on it. There was a bit of worry if she'd be able to figure it out, and I told her yes, and also strongly suggested that when she asks for my help, she should be willing to accept my recommendations.<p>Voila, Ubuntu installed and a brief, ""wow, I'm actually running linux now?"", and she was happy. Firefox, Thunderbird and OpenOffice FTW.<p>Corporations with archaic IT operations procedures will be difficult, but the Windows 98-neighbours and mothers of the world need to start using Ubuntu.",1226491147

361716,comment,361153,361425,0,0,demallien,,,"I have to disagree.  From my perspective it is an error to think that error handling can be handled separately from the main code path.  The classic example that I use to demonstrate this is to point to all of those tedious discussions that programmers have as to whether something is an exception or just normal behaviour of a system.  Straight away for me that's a red flag that a non-real distinction is being made.<p>I honestly don't see any advantage to exceptions over C-style return codes, with one important ...euh... exception:  the boiler plate for exception handlers can be well handled by modern IDEs.  All the other supposed advantages seem to be just waffling to me.  Take the whole 'Oh, but exceptions make handling errors the default!' kind of argument (several examples on this thread already).  Yes, sure, you <i>do</i> have to write exception handlers for all errors in a language such as Java.  But my experience is that if I'm writing use-once-and-throw-away in C, I'll just not use the return code.    In Java I'll just stick a whopping great big try/catch around the whole app, and be done with it.  If I'm trying to write stable code that's going to be around for a while in C, I check the error codes returned by a function every single time, which gives me around about as much work as when I am using Java, and actually handling different exceptions correctly.<p>All of which means, for me at least, that exceptions don't add anything to a language, but they do make the language just a little bit harder to learn (remembering exactly how any given language has implemented exceptions, and which resources can still be safely used when is a pain, as each language tends to have subtle differences that can bite you).",1226490517

361701,comment,361153,361630,0,0,demallien,,,"Hmmm, I've worked in the embedded world for the last 10 years, and I can tell you that the bulk of embedded code is far from hardened.  It appalls me the number of times that mobile phones, set top boxes, etc crash.  Typically, reliability is low because it is hard to run decent unit tests in an embedded environment.  You're obliged to write a type of simulator that you can run on a PC, but the simulator never has the exact same behaviour as the target system, so you can never truly verify correct code behaviour.",1226488763

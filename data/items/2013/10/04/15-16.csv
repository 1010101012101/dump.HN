At our last hackathon, we had a similar turnout (150+) and ratio (>1/3 women). Just to emphasize again the key things that worked for us:<p>* a commitment to beginners from the start<p>* a week of 2-hour classes (Hack Week) on building web applications from scratch targeted at non-developers<p>* a focus on learning rather than winning (although, we did advertise prizes)<p>* helpful mentors on call through out the tutorials and hackathon<p>* providing healthy food for those who wanted it<p>* having a diverse set of organizers, mentors and company reps who participants feel comfortable approaching during <i>and before</i> the hackathon to allay concerns about their participation<p>In my opinion, every single one of these things makes hackathons a better experience for <i>everyone</i>, so there&#x27;s no reason not to do them. To say the least, we&#x27;ve had no problem with scaring away the typical &quot;hackathon types&quot; and this year, we&#x27;re hoping to get close to a 50% ratio.",1380902399

I&#x27;m seeing some really interesting research, but the good stuff may end up being patented and sold as a drug, which sucks.<p>I&#x27;m still a Vitamin C fan, even though it&#x27;s fallen out of favor. Seems to help when I&#x27;ve stressed out my system through alcohol or other chemical irritants.<p>Also on my &quot;to-watch&quot; list is delta tocotrienols, one of the components of vitamin E. Saw some interesting evidence that it might be good at actually helping to remove coronary artery blockage, but it&#x27;s still WAY preliminary. And no, that&#x27;s not a recommendation for vitamin E itself, which in larger doses can cause all sorts of problems. Just the delta series.<p>The B series of vitamins are interesting, as there seems to be a good-sized gap between the amount most people have in their bloodstream and the amount that they can carry easily. A little dose of B-12 seems to help me enormously with concentration. At least for a short period. YMMV.<p>Note this is all subjective, and based on half-assed research and gossip. That&#x27;s one of the rules in this arena: there are no rules. :)",1380902384

It&#x27;s frustrating because either you do it properly, and have people complaining about the amount of time you spend doing the paperwork; or you fudge it, in which case whyTF do they specify it to 15 minutes why don&#x27;t they just let you give a broad outline of what you&#x27;ve done?<p>BigCo can be <i>really</i> weird.",1380902378

This is more than just propaganda, this is the mentality of the type of people who put these presentations together. That fact that whoever wrote this presentation has profiled people like this. I would wager that 99% of online &quot;terrorists&quot; are sitting around in jeans and t-shirts, on safe soil, have probably never handled a gun, let alone an AK-47 (or whatever that is on his back), probably don&#x27;t have a beard. The ones financing them probably spend their life wearing a suit and tie and are either driving a top of the line vehicle or are driven everywhere in a top of the line vehicle.<p>If you look at the world around us and review the history of terrorism, most of it&#x27;s been funded behind the scenes by one of the major superpowers, and you can&#x27;t overlook the fact that a large portion of this has been by backed by the US. It&#x27;s funny how when the US wants a government toppled, the terrorists are &quot;friendly&quot; and funded and armed by the US government, but when they&#x27;re counter to US interests, they&#x27;re suddenly part of the axis of evil and must be destroyed...<p>Perhaps if they stopped funding this ignorant behaviour and stopped supplying munitions to these terrorist interests, the problem would eventually go away... spend more on education and tolerance towards all points of view, enlightenment, the world would become a more peaceful place.<p>When will &quot;democratic&quot; governments eventually realize that money and greed is not the best approach to the furthering the human experience on this planet.<p>Sorry, didn&#x27;t mean to get off on a rant there, but that one picture triggered a bit of annoyance.",1380902287

Rather, the criticism is of the laws and policies that are in place which dictate that the FBI had to shut it down in the first place.<p>As the article notes, law enforcement has been given a &quot;hopeless task&quot;, where if you subscribe to the view that Silk Road actually made buying and selling drugs safer (as I do), shutting it down has made the whole business less safe at direct risks to citizens of many countries. As you note, the FBI had to do this, but it&#x27;s a huge indictment of our drug policy that this is the action they are compelled to take given the result.<p>Which brings us back to the war on drugs...",1380902197

We have a multitude of things that various people think are part of national welfare, but different people pick different sets of things, and they often conflict with each other. Many of these conflicts are fundamentally irreconcilable.<p>In our current system, we force people who do not agree with a certain policy goal to abide by laws aimed at achieving that goal, if there is a sufficient majority to pass such laws. That is bad. Futarchy would not change that. Imposing private law anarchy on everybody because the betting market says it would best achieve national welfare is just as bad as imposing, say, the Federal Defense of Marriage Act on everybody because a particular Congress passed it into law.<p>But futarchy adds another bad thing to this already bad system: now not just individual policies, but the measure of success for <i>any</i> policy, the definition of &quot;national welfare&quot;, gets decided by majority vote, and that measure of national welfare gets imposed on everybody, whether they agree with it or not.

But if you believe the latter, the shutdown of Silk Road IS a problem because it demonstrates that being able to technically and absolutely guarantee your ability to engage in anonymous exchanges might not be possible.  In the same way that the police searching a suspect&#x27;s house might trouble you if you believe that the right to be secure in your home means you should be able to physically prevent the police from getting in.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting concept, but one that becomes a little hard to justify when you look at what some people do with those absolute rights.

Some companies believe they need to do this for management, and since the managers know they will be moving, they optimize for short term gain at the expense of long term sustainability.<p>A favorite tactic of managers is to fire Q&A and support staff.  This is a short term win on the bottom line, but will kill things later.  It makes them look good as they get to say they &quot;optimized the workflow&quot;.  Another excellent one is to put a freeze on equipment buying and let it rot.<p>If you become a big wig and are in a company inclined to move people around for experience, please, please, please add something to your evaluations that look at the position they left 1 year ago and judge them on the sustainability.

As such, it aligns with his larger goals for a promise ecosystem, which include object-capability security and using promises as proxies for remote objects. For an example of promises applied in these contexts, see his paper at [1].<p>In practice, all of this is somewhat theoretical, as Q also serves a large constituency of &quot;normal&quot; promise users in Node and the browser. There, it differentiates itself via a focus on features and integrity over speed (mainly as a matter of prioritization; we like speed too!); excellent Node.js integration [2]; and an internal system which allows promises for remote objects via Q-Connection [3] (but also gives some nice methods for promises for objects etc. for the same-machine case [4]).<p>I would say that Q is my favorite library to work with, as it has thought out its design choices in a depth I don&#x27;t see in the other libraries---or perhaps more accurately, the choices they have made don&#x27;t align with my sense of craftsmanship as well :). That said, you should probably not use it if your concern is speed. We have always taken the position that, while speed is nice, most of the time you are doing an asynchronous operation anyway, so any overhead from the promise library will matter very little.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://research.google.com/pubs/pub40673.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/pubs/pub40673.html</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#interfacing-with-nodejs-callbacks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#interfacin...</a>\n[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/kriskowal/q-connection"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kriskowal/q-connection</a>\n[4]: <a href=""https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promise-for-object-methods"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promise-fo...</a>",1380901510

6495964,comment,6491880,6493993,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<i>Can you please explain what you meant ?</i><p>Sure, and note that my background has included secure systems design work.<p>Secure systems operate under a couple of constraints. It is as you posit, impossible to make a &#x27;completely secure&#x27; system, just as it is impossible to make a &#x27;completely safe&#x27; airplane (and the &#x27;impossible&#x27; here means that such a system continues to be usable or commercially viable). But generally if you can make a &#x27;secure enough&#x27; or &#x27;safe enough&#x27; system, then you can still make a business out of it.<p>Using a fairly simple example, general residences in the US are not secured against experienced thieves, but in general experienced thieves aren&#x27;t trying to steal things out of random houses, they go for specific houses. So the system &quot;works&quot; because you aren&#x27;t getting broken into every day. And if the house next door is burglarized your house is no less secure than it was the day before.<p>But in a cloud system the thieves get tremendous economy of scale, rather than breaking into one house they can break into every house in the city. In that way even if you don&#x27;t have &#x27;much&#x27; if you have <i>anything</i> they can steal it.<p>Cloud computing both ties together high value and low value targets on the same system, and makes the total return of compromising the system higher in proportion to the number of users of that system. That is a real challenge because now everyone needs really really good locks on their houses, the costs go up and the usefulness goes down.",1380901119

Using a full-stack framework is overkill, and needing an Static Site Generator just seems counter productive when considering simplicity is one of the biggest upsides to shipping static assets.<p>There is no good reason for static web servers to do a little extra for you like smarter redirects, clean urls, layouts/partials.

So everybody else can just ride there investment and that is the case now in that nobody has any incentive to put it thru the costly FDA approval.

6495802,comment,6494288,6495267,3,0,kefka,,,"Sure. It&#x27;s the profile (except thickness) of a Samsung Mega. The actual viewable screen size is smaller than a mega but larger than the Note 2. You need to see it to understand how exactly big this phone is. It&#x27;s by far one of the biggest phones I&#x27;ve seen (and used). I paid extra for expedited shipping, and the total was $213, and got it in 6 or 7 days.<p>It comes with 3 cases: a standard back, a snap-on hardcase for the back, and a back with a cloth-hard flap lid. I use that third one so it protects the screen. If you want 3rd party equipment for this, AliExpress does have _some_ n7889 stuff, but nothing like the OtterBoxes. The phone itself feels sturdy, and not like a bootleg. Also note, there&#x27;s no samsung logos anywhere (unlike some of the fake iphones that have peel-off stickers of the apple logo).<p>The first thing I noticed is how buttery smooth everything is. I like that mushroom live wallpaper, and I&#x27;ve never seen a frame drop or lag at all. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not much of a gamer, but Angry Birds is also perfect too. Everything just is so fast (faster than my few year old laptop). Do note, that the screen is a BIG battery eater. Then again, it&#x27;s a big screen.<p>There is a GPS on the device, however weirdly there is no compass. So the Google skydome does weird behavior. But that&#x27;s not a big deal to me. Also, the stylus is NOT a S-pen. It&#x27;s just a capacitive touch end, and the stylus does NOT work on the touch &#x27;Back&#x27; and &#x27;Home&#x27; buttons. I&#x27;m not sure if they do or don&#x27;t work like that on the Note&#x27;s, either. However, the screen can take up to 5 inputs (that does surprise me). You can see that with mobileuncle tools and go into engineer mode.<p>The device DOES have an FM radio, unlike Samsungs. And you can record FM channels (coooool), but you need headphones hooked in. I also notice better antenna and cell strength than my previous iPhone 3GS. And about the Cell: there&#x27;s 2 sim cards. The first slot supports 3G AT&T frequencies, and the second slot is a 2G. The idea is you can do calls on both, and fast data on the first slot. There&#x27;s a sim manager in the settings that you can do cool stuff like bind a user to a certain SIM.<p>It also supports Miracast, or &quot;Wireless Display&quot;. Went into a Best Buy and demoed that out. Evidently, the Samsung phones cannot handle miracast when you change orientation. This phone can. Ive never seen this before, and it was DAMN sweet :P Ended up playing Psy&#x27;s Gentleman (it was a HD video I grabbed and threw on there to see the quality of the screen).<p>It&#x27;s running Android 4.2.1 and uses MTK chipset. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be terribly hard to update the rom, as there are 2 3rd party rom mods for this phone. Phone model is Haipai Noble n7889",1380899628

6495786,comment,6495358,6495358,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I&#x27;ve been using melatonin for years every night. As a person that has extreme obstructive sleep apnea, I credit melatonin with providing me a modicum of restful sleep for the years I didn&#x27;t use a CPAP. Now that I have one, melatonin helps improve my &quot;normal&quot; sleep patterns.<p>Anecdotaly, I find melatonin usage helps my brain rewire itself every night. My belief is that increases the number of connections and associations that various concepts have, and it also elevates my mood. Not bad for something that costs mere pennies!<p>During the time I had almost no sleep, I would take quite a bit of melatonin in a desperate attempt to get some kind of rest. At times I would pop 25mg or more. I found there were no side effects, except perhaps being sleepy for the next couple of days.<p>I&#x27;ve also quit a number of times for various reasons. Just a few months ago I quit for three months due to surgery. I found quitting to be completely symptom-free, which kind of amazed me. I figured with years of usage, quitting would make it impossible to sleep. I based this opinion on numerous studies that show when you replace a naturally-occurring hormone with a supplement, your body stops producing it. Instead, I slept fine. Once I was out of the no-supplements period after surgery, I started back up with the melatonin. No side effects, and I almost immediately noticed an increase in creativity and mood.<p>I&#x27;m a supplement junkie. It&#x27;s that irrational thing that I do, my black swan interest. Yes, I know, most of the market is just BS and marketing hype. But not all of it. Melatonin is one of the 2 or 3 supplements I use that I believe really make a huge and immediately perceivable difference. Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.",1380899504

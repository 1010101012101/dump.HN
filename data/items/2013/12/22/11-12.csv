6950075,comment,6949095,6949881,8,0,eyko,,,"I don&#x27;t consider that trolling, just statement of fact. But I guess it depends on what each person considers free. GNU has a concept of freedom that it tries to protect via the GPL. Licenses like the BSD or MIT do not.<p>Personally, I think this licensing difference is what makes companies use code from one but not the other. E.g. Apple&#x27;s Darwin and it&#x27;s kernel (XNU) contains code from BSD. While Darwin is &quot;open source&quot;, it acts as the core/foundation of a closed source OS. Had they used a GNU kernel like Linux, or GNU libraries (glibc) then they&#x27;d have had an issue or two with certain uses in conjunction with closed source software (e.g. statically linking glibc). I reckon that influences decisions on what to use.<p>Perhaps the best example to fit your comment is JunOS, a closed source, FreeBSD based OS.<p>In Netflix&#x27;s case, it does seem that they modify some of FreeBSD to fit their use case, and they boast about how they will contribute back to the FreeBSD project any changes that they make. The BSD license does _not_ require them to do so, and who are we to know if they&#x27;re actually contributing everything back. If they used a GPL&#x27;d OS, they might be obliged to do it, but I&#x27;m not a lawyer.<p>I don&#x27;t believe, however, that the license played any part in Netflix&#x27;s choosing of FreeBSD, and I don&#x27;t believe that what your comment points out should be considered trolling :)",1387713291

6950027,comment,6949329,6949833,1,0,SiVal,,,"Somewhat similar to the difference between C/C++ or enterprise Java and various dynamic or &quot;scripting&quot; languages in terms of structure, the &quot;S&quot; in SQL or NoSQL. The former tends to require more up-front structural design to do anything, which is a nuisance at first when you&#x27;re not sure what you will end up needing. The latter tends to be quicker to throw together and repeatedly rearrange in the early days of its evolution, which is a huge advantage to a small startup trying to figure out what business it&#x27;s in, but often runs into trouble later, once the needs have stabilized and the structure becomes more of a benefit than a cost.<p>For areas other than structure, the difference can be more like the difference between a general purpose programming language and a domain-specific language. SQL databases are general purpose, so they offer a large, nicely integrated package of features, while NoSQL databases often sacrifice some of those features to optimize for some niche. From this perspective, the SQL database can be the best choice for a startup trying to find its niche with the NoSQL chosen as an optimization once that niche has been identified.<p>The fact that a new business can&#x27;t be sure what its business will end up being is an argument both for and against using a SQL database.",1387711808

3556363,comment,3546629,3547868,1,0,fan,,,"I believe that your metaphor above is correct in getting at some features of the startup world, namely:<p>1) Many founders are attracted by glory rather than logic.<p>2) Large companies receive research information from startup successes and failures.<p>But I don't agree with the gladiator metaphor at all because it implies a degree of deviousness and collusion that isn't present in the startup sphere, and is disingenuous to imply.<p>Take your example of the king offering $0.5M for the finder of a treasure.  Here you imply that his goal of offering the  prize is to ""give villagers a fake hope"" and ""inspire the poor"".<p>What if the treasure in reality was just worth $0.6M to him?  Then the king might conclude a) if someone had the treasure, he'd be happy to pay $0.5, but b) suppose the cost of finding the treasure via hire at $1M, then it is not worth hiring people to dig it up.<p>Thus, the king may not decide to hire people to dig this, while happily posting a prize.  He doesn't need to have ulterior motives to do this.<p>Now let's take the economics further.  Suppose some people are efficient and other people are not efficient diggers (they're good bakers), and there is no way to observe this beforehand.  Then if he hires people to dig, the king will lose money because he's at half efficiency with half bakers and half diggers.  If he posts a prize, the efficient diggers will self sort into digging, and the bakers will produce real good.<p>Our data points are few, and really just 1) and 2), so we can't know for sure companies are being evil (and I don't believe they are).  It's a classic case of an underdetermined system.",1328507601

Waves coming into the beach push water up the pipes, the other end of the pipe up on the shore has sort of a pipe organ type end with a flapper valve so it plays one note when the water rushes in and another when it rushes out.<p>Imagine a square tube that at one end underwater is just an open pipe which connects with this square tube which goes up out of the water on the beach to a pool which is say 10' above the water line. The pool has a drain which feeds a square trough going back down into the water.<p>The trough has a micro-hydro wheel in it. Or just for fun a pelton water wheel type wheel which drives an animated sculpture.<p>The interesting question for me, is this; Can the Tesla valve reduce the back flow of sea water enough that the following wave arrives with the valve still holding water?<p>Intuitively you can see that if the valve is 'full' when the wave returns then the next wave will push its mass worth out the top of the valve. If the valve is say 'half' full then the next wave should fill it and every wave after that should dump a 'half' wave's worth of water into the pool. This would be a good problem to set up for students learning computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as they could vary things like the angle of the elements, their size, and their quantity and characterize the abilities of the valve for various fluids.<p>Anyway, its a really interesting gizmo.",1328506357

In the book he describes this exercise: ""Implement a simulated world inhabited by carrots, rabbits, and wolves.  Rabbits roam this world eating carrots that grow in random patches.  When they have eaten enough carrots, the rabbits get fat and split in two.  Wolves run around eating up the rabbits; if they manage to catch and eat enough rabbits, the also get fat and split.  Rabbits and wolves within a certain distance of each other broadcast information on food and predators.  If a rabbits finds a carrot patch, other rabbits will quickly join him.  If a wolf finds a rabbit, the pack would start chasing it.""<p>I've written this now in Erlang, and in Scala, and most recently in Go.  It took me way more than a weekend, I'll confess.",1328505411

Depending on the activities you engage in through out the day, the body may need fluctuating amounts of rest. I don't think that one needs a consistent amount every day. A lot depends on the activities you have been involved in as well as your mental and physical state. Sleeping too little however, which seems to be the goal of many polyphasic sleepers is great if you are mostly performing mundane activities. However, ample sleep is essential for doing any kind of creative work.<p>The human body is extremely good at picking how much rest it needs. If you can afford to, follow your body clock instead of an alarm clock and sleep when you feel tired. Over the years, I find that naturally we are bi-phasic sleepers, requiring a long rest at night and then a short nap in the afternoon.",1328505335

3556288,comment,3555927,3556258,4,0,physcab,,,"I think learning statistics definitely helps. Simple things like averages, stdev, probability, etc will help you. Also a healthy knowledge of SQL goes a long way.<p>But more importantly, its learning how to be a detective. For example, I'm not strictly a math person. I also know Python and PHP and use it to write scripts when I need to validate a theory, often working with raw logs.<p>You also need business acumen. Analysts are like consultants in that they work with a variety of teams and stakeholders. Everyone wants to be sure that the decision they're making is the right one, and data can help them do it.  So you need an understanding of what the core issue is, how the stakeholder wants it solved, and the engineering capability to get it done in a timely fashion.<p>One of my favorite books is Collective Intelligence. Its a soft-intro to machine learning, and having read that and gone through those exercises along with taking a formal class on machine learning, has helped me see the importance of statistics applied at web scale.<p>EDIT (to the PS):\nI don't think there's a standard teaching for data science.  Everyone screens for it differently. If you apply for a job as a data scientist at LinkedIn for example (I did) they'll expect you to have a fairly formal CS background and will throw you questions any good software engineer should be able to solve.  But they also ask you questions like ""design a news feed"" or ""whats a good algorithm for a spam filter and how do you score it"" or ""how do you make an algorithm work with little data"".  I think ""data science"" is actually learning how to apply statistics at web scale problems, so my advice would be to look at things like recommenders, spam filters, classifiers, NLP, etc.",1328505096

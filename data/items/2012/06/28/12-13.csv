Wealth unjustly taken away from value creators becomes a disincentive to produce.<p>You have to look at wealth <i>creation</i>. Are the patents involved in litigation honest to god inventions that made the world a better place? Wealth was created. Eg, the first retrovirus medication.<p>Are the patents involved non inventions that were of no use, but are broad enough that patent trolls can, without merit, start seeking rent on products from companies they no part in creating? No wealth was created.

4171427,comment,4171013,4171241,2,0,mping,,,"For me, Groovy always have this feeling that's quite the opposite of Scala: it seems that it was a language that wasn't very thoroughly <i>implemented</i> and has all of these bolt-on stuff on top of it. Scala seems more solid to me because of the academic background (to think that a type system can be turing complete..), and it seems that Clojure found a place on its own.<p>In general terms, one of the flaws for me is that I can't quite decide what's the direction that Groovy's going. For example, the 2.0v is introducion static features, but AFAIK I never noticed any interest on static features (of course the groovy team should have much more to say on this). Other thing that I didn't like was the stack traces when an exception ocurred: due to the nature of the MOP, the stack traces were always very full of 'garbage' (this was some time ago, I don't know what's the story now). Another example is on the link: if you want to enable invokedynamic, you have to switch some flag on the compiler. If you compare to jRuby (which I know is not directly comparable but as an end user I really don't care) it's alread turned on if you are using the proper jRuby and JDK versions.<p>OTOH, I think Groovy nailed the Java interop spot on (flawless Java invocation/interop, integration with Ant, maven, etc) which is probably one of the good reasons to use Groovy.<p>If you consider SO to give a reasonable feedback on popularity, here's the nr of tagged questions:<p><pre><code>  * scala 549\n  * jruby 342\n  * groovy 599\n  * clojure 120\n  * ruby (for comparison) 7,115\n</code></pre>\nHaving this said, I still think that Grails is one of the best web frameworks for the JVM, although I would like it more if the plugins would have better maintenance by the community.",1340888004

Most C compilers ignore ""register"" annotations, and with good reason- they hamstring the compiler's ability to optimize, which is usually a completely opaque process from the programmer's point of view in the first place.<p>Why have a type system that includes implicit coercions between types, sometimes with different internal representations? (Just imagine an int promoting to a float.) Doesn't that obscure the ""real meaning"" of the program, or is it merely a detail you find uninteresting? C is not the only language that makes these low-level concepts accessible, and C does not represent the ""floor"" with respect to making the behavior of hardware explicit.<p>If what you're actually getting at is that C is the <i>most popular</i> language today that exposes all of those things, it sounds less convincing- Systems languages cannot advance if we take C's position as given.",1340887963

They ""bought"" and ""own"" them, and are now asserting those rights, to the expense of $29B to other companies who should be licensing the rights.<p>Nobody blames landlords of costing businesses billions of dollars a year - they own property and businesses pay rent. Nobody builds a business using a landlords property without paying rent, then plausibly claims their legal costs defending themselves against landlords asserting their rights are somehow an unexpected and unfair imposition. (Well, actually food carts probably do exactly that, but nobody writes academic papers claiming billions of dollars worth of cost for them)<p>I haven't read the whole paper, but I wonder about two other numbers - 1) how much money did the NPE's pay to the inventors of the patents they're defending (who under the current system have every right to choose ""selling their patents/IP"" as their means of monetizing their inventingwork)? and 2) how much would licensing the existing patents (instead of running up legal bill later) have been, compared to the $29B losses described here?<p>I'm not saying the current system is ""right"", but it is reasonably well understood. I can only assume the $29B cost is accepted as a ""cost of doing business"" by companies who know (or even just suspect) they may be infringing patents?

Computers began to look cool, no more beige boxes and lame looking side panels. With the birth of Aleinware, the Dell XPS and Falcon Northwest came a huge blow to the modding community. Instead of spending days modding your PC to make it look cool and perform well, you could buy one out of the box (sometimes even overclocked)! This started to eat away at the modding culture. Even console makers stepped their game up in terms of connectivity. They began to provide more codecs for video playback which was one of the main reasons to mod a console- to allow video playback.<p>2. Another thing happened which pulled me and others away from the modding/hacking community- I bought a Mac. Ever since I moved into the Apple ecosystem I haven't opened up a piece of hardware. I bought my first Macbook when I was 16 and loved it. It worked, it did everything I needed it to. I moved more into the less horsepower social game landscape where I didn't need the heavy duty processing power. Once I was in the Apple ecosystem I didn't need a home NAS server running with my torrents, I began buying my music, movies and TV shows. This content then streamed on my devices (Apple TV and mobile) perfectly. It required no hacking to work, it all came together effortlessly. I feel like this is happening to a lot of hackers. I deep down feel Apple has made people complacent with current technology and has really created a lack of need to hack your hardware and software.<p>This begs a question, has the paradigm shifted from enthusiasts pushing the envelope with hardware and software to the technology companies?",1340887573

The GIL not being fixed is in fact what makes it so bleak (to me, at least).<p>Python isn't just for scripts anymore; we have 150k lines of Python code doing nontrivial stuff and relying on many third party libraries -- ultimately probably a million lines of code or so if you trace the dependencies all the way down.<p>This is in most ways really great: the Python code is very clear and concise, and comes along with all the documentation and unit testing conventions established by the community over the years. All those high-quality third party libraries mean we don't even have to write lots of code in the first place. It's easily a 10x productivity improvement over C/C++ for us.<p>But to make this code base take proper advantage of multiple cores, we must run under Jython or IronPython. (And at least Jython has its own problems; start up times are long because the Java class loader is slow.) We can't move to 3.X even if we wanted to, because no GIL-free implementation supports 3.X. We can't rely on the processing module, because we can't afford the overhead of an entire process of memory usage per ""thread"" at scale.<p>It just sounds like the Python devs have decided that fixing the GIL is too hard, so people should just live without using multiple cores. Do they view our use case as exotic or somehow unsupported? Do they not see that it's important for a general purpose programming to support real threading? I'm not trying to be obnoxious; it's a serious question.<p>We are likely to ultimately abandon the language because of this core issue, which is tragic given the other great things we get from using it, and the lack of a genuinely equivalent alternative. ""So what, no one cares about you -- you are nobody,"" you may say. For the sake of argument, I will stipulate that. But I don't imagine our constraints are unique, and this bodes ill for the Python ecosystem. Our abandoning it is one thing; increasingly many developers abandoning it as multicore use becomes ever more important is another. Cores are getting a little bit faster with each tick and tock at Intel. But the rate at which we're getting <i>additional</i> cores looks to far outpace the per-core improvements for quite some time. This makes real threading increasingly important as time goes on.<p>I know STM is the solution du jour, and it's an admirable piece of work. If that solves the problem in the long run, great, but it's far from obvious that it's going to win without dedicated hardware support, and in any case isn't part of the reference implementation of the language (which seems to always be ahead of the other implementations).<p>I know you're saying it's not a big deal, don't worry about it, etc. but it just doesn't seem that way to me. :(",1340886863

It's only an abstraction among the others - granted, it's a lower level abstraction.<p>To understand how a computer works when it executes a program, accesses some data, writes to a disk, spawns a process and forks it, then kills the child after a certain interrupt can pretty much only be learned by learning assembly and some hardware and OS-related literature. Of course, for most programmers(let alone people in general) this is nearly useless information today. It's obsolete.

Takes input and produces output according to the standard.<p>Frankly, the only ""low-level"" thing C has over e.g. Java is that most domains in which C is used are working close to the hardware and it runs on ""the real hard machine"".

Busy work does <i>not</i> create value; <i>eliminating</i> it does.<p>The simplest way to demonstrate it is to look at the industrial revolution. Vast amounts of people were put out of work because automation made the economy more efficient. $1bn industries, as you say, were permanently shrunk to $100m industries, left right and center.<p>All those workers displaced eventually found employment elsewhere, and it turned out to be one of the largest economic booms in history.<p>Would you rather we still weave our sheets by hand employing 100 times as many workers as the modern textile industry, each one costing $1000?<p>Because that's exactly the consequence of your line of argument.",1340885517

I sure do love reading these pretentious pieces of ""intellectual"" prose.<p>In fact I shall start an ""experiment"" myself to see if replacing every instance of ""experiment"" in these kind of articles with ""controversial decision"" to see if they read better. I mean it's as if people use the word ""experiment"" to justify being avant-garde.<p>Except in this case it's not even a controversial thing. People are leaving facebook for tonnes of reasons (fad has died, not finding its uses any more, don't want to be tied with a system that hoards personal data and sells them off to companies etc). Leaving Facebook isn't an edgy thing to do; not before and not now. Anyone I knew that announced that they're ""leaving facebook"" end up being rather smugly obnoxious when tech news headlines say ""facebook did some things that people don't like. boooo facebook!"" saying they ""knew all along"" and they were obviously smarter and more superior than the regular ""tech weenie"" still on their facebook.<p>We all know what the result of this ""experiment"" is going to be. ""My life was significantly improved thanks to not using facebook. Just as I thought! Aren't I clever?"". There's no point denying it because that's what they're going to say. Just like I said I'll replace ""experiment"" with ""controversial decision"". I already know that I'm going to say ""Nope. The posts were not better at all. Told ya!"" because I know that when it's something I dislike in the first place I'm going to have a visceral reaction to hate it rather than say doing an ACTUAL experiment which doesn't have this cognitive bias.<p>And I'm right, am I? I mean I'm not WRONG or something? Please someone validate my beliefs which I portray on the internet. I desperately need this!!!",1340885401

I want to find a way to share photos in a way that encourages us to talk about them with each other.<p>Surely you can do this with or without Facebook.<p>Maybe I'm a unique snowflake but Facebook to me is exactly the opposite of that: it's a way to give a quick (often meaningless) insight into my life, what I'm thinking or what I'm doing. It's a way to share something that <i>maybe</i> someone will be interested in, but probably not. If I share something to Facebook it's not because I <i>want</i> all my friends to see it, it's because I think those that <i>might</i> see it <i>might</i> find value in it and it represents what I'm doing/thinking/enjoying. If I want someone to see something or engage with me in conversation I send them a message.<p>Facebook isn't a replacement for ""normal"" communication between friends, it's an extension. The only reason anyone would want to see complaints about someone's life falling apart is the same reason people watch train wrecks of car crashes. They don't <i>care</i> about the individual, they care about the spectacle. Using any one->many communication platform for complaints about life seems misguided.<p>Maybe <a href=""https://everyme.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://everyme.com/</a> would fill the void he has in his life.",1340885171

What I'm arguing for is what you expressed in this comment:<p>""Of course if she wears socks or a sweater she will know knitting, or at least how to manage a sewing machine (everybody should know just the basics).""<p>I don't know how to knit but my wife does, and I can sew well enough to make a Hallowe'en costume, fix a button or hem a pair of pants.<p>All the time I see people manually, painstakingly processing data as a necessary part of their jobs - repetitive, time-consuming stuff that could easily be automated with a fairly simple script. If we made basic computer programming, like basic literacy and math, a part of core education curricula, we would empower many more people to write amateur code that's <i>good enough</i> for the task at hand, just as most amateur writing is good enough to communicate meaning without being slick and professional.<p>I'm not saying everyone should work as a software developer, any more than I'm saying everyone should work as a writer. However, the general ability to read and write is absolutely invaluable no matter the career, to the extent that people who are functionally illiterate are barely employable and can scarcely function in our society.<p>Similarly, I believe a general ability to write computer programs - to express a set of steps that execute some data processing task - can become invaluable as well and unlock a huge boost in general productivity.",1340884970

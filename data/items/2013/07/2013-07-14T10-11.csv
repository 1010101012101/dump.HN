6040554,comment,6039566,6039770,9,0,kyro,,,"This is an incredibly important issue.<p>The fear that one will be sued and possibly lose their license is one that factors into the way <i>many</i> physicians practice, and at the end of the day, the patient&#x27;s suffer both financially <i>and</i> physically.<p>For example, appendicitis is largely a clinical diagnosis, meaning that a diagnosis can be made solely on the patient&#x27;s presenting symptoms and lab values, and subsequently rushed to the OR for surgery. A CT scan is <i>not</i> necessary, and should be used if the patient&#x27;s presentation is not a typical one. However, at many hospitals, CT scans are performed as part of the routine work-up. CT scans can cost $1500 a pop, and the radiation received from one is at least <i>10 times</i> the dose you&#x27;d get from an x-ray, which increases your risk for cancer.<p>In 2007, there were 68 million CT scans performed. We perform 5 scans for every 1 in France [1]. We perform the most MRI scans, which range anywhere from $2k to $5k [2][3]. Do you think we&#x27;re on the whole healthier than those in France? I would hazard a guess and say that we aren&#x27;t. In fact, with the amount of radiation we&#x27;re giving our patients, we&#x27;re likely hurting them quite a bit. Japan, our rivals for the gold medal in imaging volume, recently conducted a study that showed that 3.2 percent of cancer cases were caused by imaging radiation [4].<p>And I&#x27;m talking about just <i>one</i> largely unnecessary test performed to diagnose <i>one</i> condition. You can imagine the bigger, sadder picture.<p>Many, many physicians don&#x27;t even think twice about the amount of radiation they&#x27;re giving to their patients, or how much they&#x27;re costing the system, or the incentives they&#x27;re giving companies who are a part of this chain of inflation to continue to sell scanners and charge exorbitant amounts. They order the tests because they don&#x27;t want a lawsuit at the expense of patients&#x27; health and pockets. I don&#x27;t necessarily blame them. Out of the thousands of patients a doctor sees, all it takes is one minor slip-up to drag them into a legal battle that may very well tarnish their record, cost millions of dollars, and result in losing their license.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/health_glance-2009-en/04/03/g4-02-04.html?contentType=%2Fns%2F+Chapter%2C%2Fns%2FStatisticalPublication&itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fserial%2F19991312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/health_glance-2009-en/04/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/health_glance-2009-en/04/03/g4-02-03.html?contentType=%2Fns%2F+Chapter%2C%2Fns%2FStatisticalPublication&itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fserial%2F19991312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/health_glance-2009-en/04/...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.newchoicehealth.com/MRI-Cost"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newchoicehealth.com/MRI-Cost</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/6035.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/6035.php</a>",1373799217

6040525,comment,6040234,6040234,5,0,xiaoma,,,"I did Hack Reactor.  AFIK, it&#x27;s got by far the heaviest workload (and highest tuition) of the above mentioned programs and it paid off beyond my expectations.  I was looking for two thingshard skills and some social proof due to having made it into such a selective program.<p>The social proof didn&#x27;t happen.  The program was just too new and employers hadn&#x27;t even heard of it yet.  Fortunately, the hard skills I gained from the course were substantial enough that it didn&#x27;t matter.  I actually leap-frogged past where many of my acquaintances with CS or engineering degrees were.  From what I understand, the current Hack Reactor classes actually are getting some significant name recognition along with the skills.<p>By the end of my course, I had serious interest from Google, Groupon, a Japanese game company, a cool consultancy doing cutting edge stuff with Ember and a couple of start-ups, one of which is building on Meteor.  I went with Groupon, mostly because of the team and the tech stack.  Another factor was that it&#x27;s well enough known of a company that working there will pretty much ensure my liberal arts degree won&#x27;t be held against me in the future by any but the most credential-obsessed companies.  Only Google offered more in that regard, but I didn&#x27;t get the impression that people there were too into JavaScript, or any dynamically typed languages, for that matter.  It&#x27;s possible I just caught the wrong interviewer, though.<p>Hack Reactor did well for me in several areas. Coming into the job at Groupon, I was being able to contribute right away and I was already familiar with the technologies in our office (Rails, Node, Backbone, CoffeeScript, CSS preprocessors, git, etc).  Another great thing has been the network.  I know tons of motivated smart people who are now working all over the bay area. When I set out to do a start-up, I&#x27;ll very likely be teaming up with a fellow HackR Alumni.  The final big help has been just a general solid CS grounding.  Having already implemented hashes, trees, prefix trees, map, reduce, once, memoize, etc. has definitely been helpful.  We certainly didn&#x27;t learn everything, but we learned enough to have some idea what we don&#x27;t know and where to go to learn more.<p>As for difficulties, I&#x27;d say the biggest was not being fully prepared for large codebases.  It definitely took more time to get oriented and figure out where various data was coming from at work than it did on the projects I was working on at Hack Reactor.  It was also a little jarring to see how OO-focused the programming world at large is, since I had been working more with functional maker patterns than pseudo classical patterns.  Writing a scheme interpreter in JavaScript was one of the things I worked on as a personal project.<p>I don&#x27;t know Java yet.  That definitely causes a bit of friction when looking at general CS resources online.  I&#x27;m not terribly concerned though.  I&#x27;m pushing onwards, taking coursera classes and doing my best to maintain some of the momentum I&#x27;ve carried over from my 80 hour weeks at Hack Reactor, within the framework of a more balanced life.<p>tldr; The program was fantastic.  It&#x27;s already paid for itself and the network is amazing.",1373798147

The thing is that for small companies, bad hires can be disastrous for any position key to the company&#x27;s execution.<p>For instance, hiring a bad dev can be very costly. There is all of the time/work required to find, onboard and provide knowledge transfer, the real expense associated with the employee (i.e. compensation), and the fact that it generally takes time to determine it&#x27;s not working. In that time the product hasn&#x27;t moved forward as it could have and the company is out of a lot of time and money. And, frequently, it is the principals who are taking time away from building and running the company in order to try to hire/train. So, it&#x27;s an even bigger disruption to the company.<p>For, say, a bootstraped company that has a small dev team (or the founders are the only dev) and not a LOT of money, this can be really painful or game ending.

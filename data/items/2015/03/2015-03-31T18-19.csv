Consumers in Thailand, India and Indonesia do - they are local smartphone brands. Look at the promo video. Notice how many Asian faces there are?<p>This isn&#x27;t about cheap Chromebooks, it&#x27;s about a major strategic effort to court the global middle class. As with the Android One initiative, Google are seeking to establish an affordable but capable gateway to their services for middle-income consumers. They&#x27;re working with local companies to leverage local marketing and distribution resources. In these markets, the Chromebook isn&#x27;t being pitched as a cheap substitute for a &#x27;real&#x27; laptop, but as an upgrade from a smartphone or tablet.<p>If their strategy for Chrome OS works half as well as their Android strategy, then the industry is going to be unrecognisably transformed over the next few years. A whole generation of consumers could come to see the Chrome OS pseudo-thin-client model as the norm, with full-fat operating systems being a niche curio.",1427828381

My old employer always tried to interview 2 candidates from the same company and region so they can compare the rankings and data presented by the candidates. There was also an informal network of information sharing as everyone had worked for everyone else in the industry at some point and had contacts they could reach out to. Plus, prestigious recognitions, things like Chariman&#x27;s/President&#x27;s clubs for top reps, usually get listed in some publicly available form (ours was in our quarterly fluff magazine available on our website).<p>Now is it ethical? I&#x27;ve noticed that there&#x27;s a recognized line in sales culture between information concerning a rep&#x27;s personal performance and proprietary company information. Things like stack rankings (scrubbed of $ figures), activity stats, close ratios, etc are considered kosher by everyone as they don&#x27;t reveal anything that could realistically damage the company. Things like a rep&#x27;s list of contacts, anything with revenue figures, etc are frowned upon as they are considered unethical for a variety of reasons. It shows the candidate is willing to damage their employer and knowing that data puts the hiring company in a bad legal position.<p>Salespeople are judged on their performance and their performance is unique in that it can be quantified in hard numbers. Sales culture has a high level of tolerance for sharing of relevant information as it benefits everyone involved. Candidates get objective proof of their value to a potential employer and employers get objective information, making their hiring decision truly informed instead of a subjective crapshoot like you find in elsewhere.",1427828168

If your up for another solution, I know Halcyon[0] is supposed to be very frictionless.<p>> Among what I&#x27;ve seen in Haskell, ORMs and web frameworks are the two types of libraries that carry the largest and most cumbersome monad transformer stacks around; making a website involves having to typecheck a huge monad transformer into another huge monad transformer.

Not saying this product has a need (I feel like I can use my smartphone) but you&#x27;ve completely missed the big picture of deliveries for everything.

9298968,comment,9297904,9297904,0,0,tzs,,,"(I&#x27;m kind of getting the feeling I completely failed to understand the point of this article, or am at least misunderstanding the point of the examples...so the following may be WAY off)<p>He&#x27;s got a point about it not being clear if &quot;Passwords need 10 characters&quot; means they must be exactly 10 characters long or at least 10 characters long. It is the latter. If you put a password of less than 10 characters in the first password field, when you move on to re-enter the password it will immediately flag the error with the message &quot;Your Password must be at least 10 characters long&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m a bit confused, though, by the imaginary dialog between him and two clerks showing how these requirements would work if this were done in person. To reflect the actual form, the dialog should be more like this:<p>HIM: Here is the password I want. (Hands paper to clerk).<p>CLERK: Passwords have to have at least one special character from this list. (Gives list to him).  Your does not have one of these.<p>CLERK: Also, passwords can only contain letters, numbers, and characters from the special character list. (Point to the list he just handed over). You have a special character that is not on the list.<p>HIM: (Replaces the disallowed character with one from the allowed special character list) (Hands new password request to the clerk). OK, try this one!<p>CLERK: That meets our requirements.<p>I&#x27;m not sure at all where that part of his dialog about question mark being a special character but not a character comes from. The password &quot;Ab345?7890&quot; is accepted by the password checking JavaScript, even though it is exactly 10 characters long and so the ? must be counting as both a special character and as a character.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong here...I&#x27;m not saying these requirements are OK. I find requirements like this annoying, because I use a password manager to generate my passwords. I can easily tell the password manager to include or exclude special characters, but I don&#x27;t get to pick which special characters it picks from. At a site like the Post Office, which limits the set of special characters, I might have to generate several passwords before I hit one that is acceptable.<p>As a password manager user, what I really want out of sites is for them to allow long passwords, and place no restrictions on the characters in those long passwords. I will then use 25 character random passwords consisting of digits and lower case letters. That gives me 128 bits of entropy, but if it needs to be manually typed for some reason it is not too bad. I&#x27;m OK if they place some character requirements on shorter passwords...but if the password is long enough, let me do what I want.<p>So yeah, the requirements are annoying. I am just having a hard time believing that the red explanations that appear when the first password field loses focus were not sufficient to enable someone who programs at Google to manage to come up with a password acceptable to the Post Office.<p>I&#x27;d say the Post Office actually did a pretty good job of implementing the form. Most sites just tell you that your password violates the rules, and it is up to you to re-read the full list of rules trying to figure out which ones tripped you. The Post Office form tells you exactly which rules were violated.",1427827977

&quot;...the other main reason Americans seem so unperturbed by the widening chasm between the rich and everyone else is what I like to call the lottery effect. Buying lottery tickets is clearly an irrational act -- the odds are hugely stacked against us. But many millions of us do, because we see the powerful evidence that an ordinary person, someone just like us whose only qualifying act was to buy a ticket, wins our favorite lottery every week. For many Americans, the nation’s rowdy form of capitalism is a lottery that has similarly bestowed fabulous rewards on the Everyman.&quot; - <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/21/rising-wealth-inequality-should-we-care/the-lottery-mentality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/21/rising-wealt...</a><p>2) Last Place Aversion
&quot;that poor Americans’ antipathy toward redistribution might be due not to their desire to one day be at the top of the income distribution, but to their fear of falling to the bottom. We show that humans have a deep psychological aversion to being in “last place” -- recall the shame of being picked last in gym class -- such that individuals near the bottom of the income distribution may be wary of redistribution because it could help those just below them leapfrog above them.&quot; - <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/09/19/do-taxes-narrow-the-wealth-gap/tax-policy-and-americans-last-place-aversion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/09/19/do-taxes-nar...</a><p>3) The Just World Fallacy
&quot;The just-world hypothesis (also called the just-world theory, just-world fallacy, just-world effect, or just-world phenomenon) refers to the tendency for people to want to believe that the world is fundamentally just. As a result, when they witness an otherwise inexplicable injustice they rationalize it by searching for things that the victim might have done to deserve it. This deflects their anxiety, and lets them continue to believe the world is a just place, but often at the expense of blaming victims for things that were not, objectively, their fault.&quot; - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis</a><p>Hopefully articles like this will get more people to understand these things.",1427827452

Basically you have to open the machine and remove a screw to enable write access to the bios.

You could also have a linux kernel as a payload but this was more complex and I didn&#x27;t need faster boot times.<p>Once all this is done, the laptop behaves much like any other laptop except you have an open source bios.

9298835,comment,9296431,9296779,0,0,HillRat,,,"I do think the real issue is not whether the NSA can fill cubes, but whether they can stay ahead of the threat curve. NSA competes with, but not for, the employees of foreign intelligence services; likewise, they used to compete for the same talent pool as top tech companies, but not <i>against</i> those companies.<p>Then they decided to turn the Big Ear inwards and go to war with US tech companies. Now firms like Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc. are building active defenses against the NSA, which means that they&#x27;re hiring for the same problem domain, with better salaries and benefits, no security checks or polys, and no stigma (and a lot of prestige) attached to the position. As a result, NSA is threatened with losing precisely those talents necessary to keep ahead of foreign adversaries.<p>The savage irony of this is that both the NSA and tech companies are at a Nash equilibrium that is non-Pareto optimal; NSA loses top-tier candidates, and tech companies have to expend resources to protect themselves from NSA and other threats. An ideal scenario would be for a trusted NSA to work <i>with</i> tech companies to support strong crypto and security, but that&#x27;s a nonstarter in the political and bureaucratic climate.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d like to see the defensive aspects of the NSA broken out into a separate agency, preferably either cabinet-level or independent, with the singular mission of protecting the security and privacy of all Americans, covering everything from crypto to vulnerability discovery to privacy recommendations and (where applicable) rulemaking. You would assume that NSA would still be in competition with a hypothetical Information Security Assurance Agency for discovering vulnerabilities, but the ISAA would not have the balancing test of &quot;does this vulnerability threaten Americans more than it helps us listen on our adversaries?&quot; Think of it as a FEMA for the cybersecurity age.",1427827001

This continued coddling of clients makes it very hard to introduce new software into the market, because you can&#x27;t do it without deep pockets and sloooooow sales cycles.<p>Second, the physicians are very much overloaded with alarms and alerts--and instead of saying &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s figure out why we keep ending up with so many alarms&quot; they instead do the short-term thing and just ignore or turn them off. The entire profession is rooted in split-second decisionmaking, for reasons I cannot fathom. They really, really, really want to be the heros that come in and save the day, and systematic approaches to operations optimization just aren&#x27;t a priority.<p>Third, the data coming off of these things (and at work we&#x27;ve seen this) usually indicates large operational deficiencies. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t just tell the clients &quot;Hey, you all are doing things wrong, and here&#x27;s the proof&quot;, because they either won&#x27;t care, or they will fire you and bring in somebody who keeps them happy, or they&#x27;ll care but be unable to make changes because that introduces uncertainty into their line of work and that could hurt someone--nevermind all the existing casualties.",1427826331

I find the &#x27;slave-like conditions&#x27;a bit unfair.<p>Now I can&#x27;t speak for Amazon themselves, most of the complaints seem to stem from the fact that being a picker IS a skill. Not everyone can be good at it. It&#x27;s physical - which I personally found fantastic, getting paid to stay fit, and on company time. You need to have somewhat a good memory, but more importantly an analytical brain to process the information on the scanner. Whilst the locations of the items might not have any seemingly logical order, the layout of the facility does. If you can process the bin locations immediately then you save many seconds of your target. Which brings me to the targets. It may seem &#x27;slave-like&#x27; to have a timer between picks but each and every one is achievable (through analysis of every other pick ever made), and even if you miss a pick by 5 seconds, you&#x27;ve probably saved 5 seconds somewhere else during that same day/week/month (depending on how they evaluate your performance). Again though that&#x27;s no to say that everyone has the skill to do so.<p>The episode you highlighted mentions that employees at Amazon tend to enjoy their work. If you can do the job, there&#x27;s very little stress, pay can be good - we&#x27;re talking about a generally unskilled job, certainly more than most retail stores. Decent benefits - vacation, healthcare etc. Shifts can be very favourable depending on the facility - 4 in 4 off can mean long weekends and plenty of opportunity for family time.<p>Some days I wish I was just picking.",1427826033

Bubbles have a way of going higher and further than anyone expects. As they do so, everyone gets their turn to look like a fool. Initially the bubble skeptics look like idiots and the believers are repeatedly proven right as the bubble builds and builds. Then the bubble pops and the situation inverts. When bubbles do pop they often do so rapidly and destructively.<p>To the extent that our civilization is dependent upon fossil fuels, complex technological civilization is therefore also a bubble.<p>I&#x27;m really surprised this doesn&#x27;t scare the crap out of more people. It&#x27;s really simple math and physics, and most of the people here have lived through two economic mega-bubbles so you all know what a bubble looks like. You&#x27;ve all seen how &quot;it&#x27;s different this time&quot; until it isn&#x27;t, and then <i>crash</i>.<p>If we&#x27;re still 80+% dependent upon fossil fuels and a real crash comes, this could be an extinction level event. It would likely trigger a global thermonuclear or biological war, since game theoretically the rational course of action would be to attempt to exterminate the <i>rest</i> of humanity as quickly as possible so you have some chance of survival in the face of a rapidly collapsing resource base. A likely scenario would be a brutal Darwinian war of all against all played out in a matter of years, and given our capacity for destruction it&#x27;s possible that nobody would win.<p>Slower but equally catastrophic scenarios are possible too. An oil crash could lead to immense expansion of the use of coal and coal-to-liquids technology, which would cause exponential increases in CO2 emissions per unit energy generated. As EROEI crashes, we just dig up exponentially increasing <i>quantities</i> of carbon since the <i>net energy profit</i> per unit is declining. If we think we have a carbon problem now, imagine the emission curve going hockey stick. This ends with planetary desertification, an anoxic event, or some kind of chaotic flip to a new ice age.<p>This IMHO is <i>the</i> existential threat faced by humanity in the 21st century.

I think that if you act ethically (which is admittedly a question mark sometimes for any big corporation) respecting the market can often do the most social good.<p>People who were doing silly work making video games pushed the boundaries of parallel processing, created the GPU industry, and now that is relied on for serious scientific research. People making social networks so college freshman could date made tools to help those fighting authoritarian governments connect and created infrastructure technology to work on big data problems the governments might face on social issues.<p>Who did more to help the Asian Tigers raise from poverty to economic superpowers? Peace Corps people distorting local economies with their help, or people investing in local infrastructure because it was good value for them to make money??<p>What&#x27;s better for the world, besides your conscious, working for a soup kitchen for work that can be done for $10/hr, or freelancing for $50/hr and donating that to the soup kitchen to give someone with less skills a job and the soup kitchen $40 remaining to buy supplies they need?<p>Finally, a lot of really smart people end up going in to law or finance because that&#x27;s where the money is. Even if making consumer ad-tech doesn&#x27;t sound quiet as noble as researching novel energy, if it encourages people to start entering fields where they are building things rather than creating more regulation for things, it&#x27;s probably a net-positive.

9298560,comment,9297946,9297946,0,0,dalke,,,"One thing about trauma is that different people are affected differently. When my wife was preparing to deploy for Iraq, the Army training included a simulation of an overturned vehicle. Beforehand people were asked if they had been in an overturned car accident before. This can be traumatizing to some, and could be excused if wanted. She had been in such an accident, but wasn&#x27;t traumatized by it and with through the simulator.<p>So just because the author of this piece can deal with trauma doesn&#x27;t mean that all people could deal with trauma the same way.<p>But I don&#x27;t see the direct connection from microagressions as being a form of trauma. Eg, from  <a href=""http://www.extension.umn.edu/family/cyfc/our-programs/ereview/docs/cmhereviewOct10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extension.umn.edu/family/cyfc/our-programs/erevie...</a> :<p>> Wing Sue and his colleagues identify three types of microaggressions<p>> 1.  A microinsult is characterized by communications that convey
rudeness and insensitivity and demean a person’s racial heritage or
identity (for example, eye rolling during a discussion about an
individual’s racial identity).<p>> 2.  Microinvalidations are communications that exclude, negate or
nullify the psychological thoughts, feelings, or experiential reality
of a person of color.  An example is a white person stating to a
person of color that they “don’t see color”, which denies that
person’s racial and ethnic experiences. Another example is a
non-Native person asking someone of AIAN culture whether or not he or
she is a “real Indian”. This demands an explanation that few others
are required to deliver.<p>> 3.  A microassault is an explicit racial derogation characterized
primarily by a verbal or nonverbal attack meant to hurt the intended
victim. This can happen through name-calling, avoidant behavior, or
purposeful discriminatory actions. Microassaults against AIAN people
also appear in the form of advertisements that depict white models in
Native clothing, associations between AIAN people and aggressive
sports teams, and messages that connect AIAN people with alcohol
use. Microassaults are typically more conscious and deliberate than
other forms of microaggression.<p>Even though that quote is from a document that connects microagressions to historical trauma, it says that microagressions are a form of violence, not trauma.<p>Giving someone a papercut is a form of violence. Do it enough times and it can lead to trauma, but a papercut isn&#x27;t in and of itself particularly traumatic.<p>To give an example from an entirely different context - a book from 1970 concerning Swedish culture, especially as it applies to Americans of Swedish descent:<p>> Being taught from childhood to observe the rule of modesty, yes, self-effacement, a Swede is deprived of initiative and confidence from the start. And this lack has made its mark on most Swedes of earlier generations. It can be traced to Americans of Swedish descent up to this time. They will know the phrase, det är ingenting [&quot;that is nothing&quot;], which reflects the concept that praise must be minimized. However lovely she thinks her dress is, a Swedish woman of an earlier vintage would invariably reply to a compliment: &quot;Åh, den här gamla trasan!&quot; (Oh, this old rag), or something equally disparaging.<p>Being told once that an idea of yours is nothing? Survivable. Being told that from a baby? That changes your life. And not really in a good way.<p>I get the feeling that the feelings behind this essay are more akin to Bob Newhart&#x27;s character  in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-Tej0297wk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-Tej0297wk</a>  .

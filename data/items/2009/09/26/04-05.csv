845031,comment,844920,845007,0,0,icefox,,,"After hacking on the netflix contest it was fun to sign up for netflix and give the recommendation system a try.  After putting in several hundred movies I now typically only choose recommendations that it thinks I would rate a 4 or 5.  Most are good and rank about what they think I will. This includes plenty of older movies including some silent films which I absolutely loved after seeing them where before I would have never even considered watching them.   On the flip side the brand new movie of the month that I _must see_ and added to the top of my que I end up ranking much lower on average.  So I would very much agree, on a given week I don't want to watch the new dvd/movie that just came out as it probably isn't that good compared to the top 500 of the last 100 years which I have only started going through.",1253940831

While I think not having comment scores will have a somewhat limiting effect on groupthink voting, it will also probably have a counter-effect on pithy/silly one-liner comments by preventing people from noticing that no matter how humorous or witty the comment might have been it has already gathered as many votes as it deserves.

In fact, the real manipulation is the idea of new releases, that half the demand should be for this season's movies. The actual best movies of all time are probably not on this week's best sellers list. It's a Hollywood marketing artifact: because buzz causes a superlinear advertising conversion rate, it works best to promote movies in short bursts. New releases also skew revenue from rental stores towards Hollywood (since rental stores have to buy enough for peak demand) so you can't blame Hollywood for doing it.",1253940017

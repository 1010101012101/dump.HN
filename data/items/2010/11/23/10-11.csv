Sometimes, the religion pursuit serves as a very good medium to convince people into such extreme action, nevertheless, it is not meaningless. In your post, you imply that such suicide attack would invoke in the process of reunification but IMHO, it is very unlikely. Most of suicide bombers hold a religion belief and a very strong desire to realize or just spell out a particular political pursuit. Someone would argue that the Communism ideology is a religion, but you should look at Russia, at East Europe, even if it is a religion, it must be a very unpersuasive one. There must be a loads of troubles when you try to reunite two countries, but I guess that would be much more peaceful process than the Iraq or Afghanistan.",1290509943

Typically when you start building something is the time when you know the least about the problem you're trying to solve and the issues you'll face solving it. That problem is subject to much more change early than late. If you build an API on day one may just be creating more work for yourself later on;<p>2. If you provide a public API, you are quite possibly exposing your data model and any assumptions that underpin it. This can make it much harder to change later as circumstances change. Think of it as making everything (including data members) public in class. It's abstraction; and<p>3. What value does an API provide <i>you</i> as the service provider?<p>Twitter is an easy example of this: it doesn't really matter where the Tweets (sorry nytimes) come from as Twitter owns the graph, the distribution and the Tweets.<p>Now consider a site like Stackoverflow. What if you could ask questions, search for answers, vote, view your summary information and so on completely via an API. What value would there be in the SO site?

Web developers who come from a freelance web site building background are more familiar with PHP - its a very consumable technology for people that haven't got a lot of time to invest in learning technologies.

There are still jobs which require that ""CS or related"" piece of paper to get you in the door.  Again, it's not necessary though because there is enough work for developers that you probably don't need those other options.  Also, some of those jobs will waive that requirement if you have a certain number of years of experience.<p>The biggest consideration for me in your position would be the requirements to switch majors.  I imagine you would be looking at quite a bit more school.  Unfortunately, a CS degree requires a lot of classes which build on each other which Journalism doesn't require, so I'm betting you would be looking at another couple of years in school at the least.<p>Personally, I wouldn't bother, but school wasn't for me.  I dropped out to go into web development and I'm rarely asked for a resume and I have never been asked about my educational background.  I feel like communication and good writing skills are important for dealing with people, so you should be strong in that area as a Journalism major.<p>The caveat in this is that freelance web development will eventually get old (stressful, tricky to balance work and life, etc) and I don't consider web development to be software development.

We have very high levels of debt, we don't have good politicians or political parties, we have lots of corruption, high and constantly changing taxes, high administrative overhead, the so-called redistribution factor is 50% (meaning every second dollar produced is eaten up by the gov't and then redistributed to its network of ""friendly"" companies through gov't jobs, projects and grants or sent abroad to pay interest). Yesterday I went to a meeting where I learned that the buzzword ""innovation"" is defined in hungarian state documents as getting a gov't grant and then doing something with that.<p>We're doing a startup, and one of the first question we usually get is ""which grant did you get?"". When we say we didn't, that we bootstrapped ourselves people think we're crazy.<p>I don't know whether we would have been better off with a not-so-peaceful transition, and nobody wants violence in their country, but we definitely need some kind of politico-economic ""revolution"". Unfortunately, I'm beginning to think we don't have the necessary political resources (good people on the state side) for that. I don't think a smart and good-intentioned person today goes into politics here.<p>So, based on my experiences here --- given how much they're behind economically, politically and technically --- unless the North Koreans overthrow Kim Jong-il themselves, they're pretty much fucked for the next 50-100 years, because no externally imposed force will magically fix their system for free. Their best bet is to unite with South Korea in a painful way (eg. forget their own laws, taxes, gov't agencies and crappy gov't run companies, which means tons of people loose their job, and adopt what they have in South Korea), the way East Germany united with West Germany.<p>Of course, I'm just a programmer, so what do I know =)",1290508087

1933238,comment,1932821,1932821,0,0,cletus,,,"I'll give you my take on this as a Java programmer of 10+ years experience.<p>The problem you will have with Java in a startup is that Java's frameworks are by and large built for ""enterprises"". I put that in quotes because in one sense it doesn't really mean anything. In another, it's more of an idea of what governments and large companies want.<p>Even when using Spring (which, in my opinion, is a ""must have"" for pretty much any Java Web project), the amount of boilerplate required to set up an endpoint, map form data to objects, map those ""presentation objects"" into ""business objects"", map those ""business objects"" into a DAO (data access object), etc is pure torture.<p>Now this isn't completely the fault of the language. The language certainly doesn't help matters by being statically typed. This just doesn't gel well with how ""fast"" Web development works. Compare that to PHP (as just one example), where form data is just a map (hash or simply ""array"" in PHP parlance). Add a new field? Not a problem.<p>Add a new field in Java and you'll be making class modifications in about eight different places.<p>The bigger part of the problem is not the static typing though, it's the philosophies that dominate the Java landscape. There is a joke about the Java programmer's response to any problem is ""just add one more layer and it'll be OK"". It's funny because it's true.<p>It's fair to say that Fowleresque division of responsibility based layering is pervasive.<p>Of course the dynamic languages can have other problems (eg no error when misspelling a form field) and Java's static typing has, in my opinion, made Java's IDEs the best of any language or platform bar none (IntelliJ in particular). IDEs seem less able with dynamic languages because it's much harder (if not downright impossible) for an IDE to, for example, derive the members (let alone the types of those members, if that concept has meaning) on the fly.<p>Weirdly some in the PHP world have tried to mimic Java's deep layering with these horrific (imho) MVC frameworks that (again imho) simply combine the worst of both worlds. Dynamic class loading, bootstrappers, magic (and sometimes unpredictable) file loading, enforced directory structures and so on are just the wrong approach most of the time.<p>Java does have some benefits though. There are basically three tiers of languages in terms of performance (from best to worst):<p>1. C/C++/Assembler: the true compiled languages;<p>2. Java, C# (and the other .Net languages): the bytecode or virtual machine ""semi-compiled"" languages; and<p>3. Python, Perl, Ruby, PHP, etc: the scripted languages.<p>I qualify this by saying: most of the time (particularly for Web apps and especially if you don't have Google-level scale problems) <i>performance doesn't matter</i>. What matters is productivity and productivity is similarly tiered from worst to best in that above list. Hardware is now so cheap that it's far more effective to throw hardware at <i>most</i> problems than it is to write things in C. This is <i>almost</i> universally true when it comes to the Web where network latency and the speed at which the browser can process your page (and Javascript) will dwarf serverside performance <i>most of the time</i>.<p>I did a bunch of the Facebook puzzles awhile ago. The breathazlyer one was quite interesting. I started doing that in Python but it is somewhat difficult to get a solution to pass in that. Java is an order of magnitude faster. C is one <i>or more</i> orders of magnitude faster yet again.<p>So back to your original question (now that my answer has some context): I would say that using Java may make sense if everyone knows it and is comfortable with it. If not you will find many speed barriers along the way of learning a new language that may just slow you down or (worse) may create huge problems (eg security issues you weren't aware of because something didn't work the way you simply assumed that it did).<p>None of these problems are insurmountable but the way I figure it is this: when writing something new, chances are that within a year you'll be best off throwing it out and starting again anyway as the problem changes, you identify your bottlenecks (often not what you thought they'd be to begin with) and your scale changes.<p>So don't try and find the perfect language or platform or framework. Write something now and don't try and solve every problem you may ever have today.",1290507654

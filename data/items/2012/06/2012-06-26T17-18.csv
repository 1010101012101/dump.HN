Dismissing the significance of a CBO is a mistake.<p>For one thing, it's not an optimizer like gcc at all. It doesn't take your existing algorithm and speed it up, it <i>chooses a better algorithm</i>. How does it know which is better? It collects statistics and runs them through a cost model.<p>This is what allows something like PostgreSQL to offer nested loop joins, merge joins, and hash joins. Without a CBO, how would it know which to choose? Similarly, it can offer multiple ways to use the same index (normal index scan, bitmap index scan) and multiple ways to aggregate (Sort+Group or HashAggregate).<p>Those are just a few of the many <i>algorithms</i> postgres offers that are chosen in a principled way by the CBO.",1340733562

This would allow one to re-use an index as either a forward or backward index, and the order of the index is no longer important. I am not sure how easy this is to do in a lock free fashion. However, if one were to adopt a strategy which combines functional data structures and RCU, I am guessing that it would be possible to implement it with relatively good readability.<p>Additionally, skip-lists can be used for performing range queries as well. This means that ""SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"" can be executed very efficiently as long as there is a skip-list on ""id"". Additionally, even COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), etc... queries can be optimized in a similar fashion. Again, however, doing it in a lock-free manner might not be the most fun thing to do.",1340733514

4163175,comment,4161664,4161664,15,0,stevenwei,,,"I really have never understood the ORM hate. I've found them to be immensely useful in 99% of circumstances, and for the remaining 1%, a good ORM will always let you fall back to raw SQL. Aside from providing a simpler syntax for performing basic queries, there are a few features that ORMs provide that have greatly simplified my life:<p>1. Automatically using prepared statements and validating/escaping query arguments to prevent injection. You have to be quite a bit more careful when you're working with raw SQL.<p>2. Providing an clean API to construct complex queries.<p>This typically becomes an issue when you have a query where you are filtering and/or sorting by multiple fields which are specified by the user, some of which are conditional. If you're writing raw SQL you end up needing to do a lot of string manipulation which can get fairly messy (and makes the code more difficult to understand). An ORM which provides some sort of query builder syntax that lets you do:<p><pre><code>  if (some condition):
    query.addWhere(clause)
  if (some other condition):
    query.addWhere(other clause)
  etc.
</code></pre>
is pretty convenient.<p>3. Collating repeated result rows from joins<p>Whenever you're working with joins you end up with repeated data in your result set, which you generally end up having to collate before display. For example if I have <i>Recipes</i> <- (many to many) -> <i>Categories</i> and do a query to load the both of them, I might end up with something like this:<p><pre><code>  recipe_id | recipe_name  | recipe_ingredients | category_id | category_name
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1         | Shrimp Pasta | 1 cup tomato sauce | 1           | Pasta
  1         | Shrimp Pasta | 1 cup tomato sauce | 2           | Seafood
  1         | Shrimp Pasta | 1 cup tomato sauce | 3           | Shrimp
  2         | Fruit Cake   | 4 cups flour...    | 4           | Dessert
  2         | Fruit Cake   | 4 cups flour...    | 5           | Cakes
</code></pre>
Without an ORM I have to loop through the result set to re-format the data the way I wanted before displaying it. An ORM takes care of that for me and gives me back 2 <i>recipes</i> with their <i>categories</i> accessible via <i>recipe.categories</i>.<p>4. Simplified manipulation of many-to-many relationships. Following the above example, if I want to add a new <i>Category</i> to a <i>Recipe</i> I can simply do:<p><pre><code>  recipe.categories.add(category)
</code></pre>
If I want to set the categories to something entirely different, I can do:<p><pre><code>  recipe.categories = [category1, category2, category3, etc]
</code></pre>
Without the ORM I would have to manually sync up the entries in the join table which is kind of a pain in the ass. Working with join tables in general is rather obnoxious, so I'm quite glad that the ORM takes care of that one for me.<p>5. Some ORMs give you notifications when an object (or collection of objects) changes. This is pretty important on the client side when you want to make sure the data you're displaying stays up to date, even as it is being manipulated. For example: if I'm viewing a <i>recipe</i> on my iPad and I update that <i>recipe</i> on my desktop. A background thread is running which keeps the two synchronized, and at some point the underlying <i>recipe</i> is updated in the database on my iPad.<p>If I'm working with raw SQL there's basically no way to know when that object is changed (short of polling it periodically, or rolling your own notification system). But my ORM will keep me notified of changes to the object so I can refresh the user interface with the updated recipe after the sync completes.<p>6. Some ORMs implement a <i>unit of work</i> that allows you to track what changes have been made to an object since it was retrieved from the database. So you can easily see which fields have been modified, and then when you go to save the object back out, it will intelligently only issue the SQL to update the columns which have changed, or won't even touch the database if nothing has actually changed.<p>7. Some ORMs put their objects into an <i>identity map</i>, so if you query for the same object under multiple different scenarios (e.g different areas of your UI), you always get the same underlying instance back. This means that you don't have multiple copies of what is semantically the same object floating around in different places of your app, and the object is always up to date with the latest changes.<p>Note: my use case is typically client-side database backed software, so features like (5), (6), and (7) save me from having to do a TON of work. If you're doing more web oriented stuff, I can see how those particular features may be less useful to you. Still, I think ORMs are a huge win overall.<p>Of course, none of this absolves you from needing to know what's going on at the database level. You still have to know what SQL your ORM is generating in order to make sure you're using it correctly. But I get really confused when people badmouth ORMs and try to tell me that it's simpler to use raw SQL, cause it never has been for me and my use cases<i>. And the funniest thing is, if I stuck with raw SQL while attempting to solve all of the problems I listed above, I probably would end up with a half-assed version of a full-fledged ORM anyway.<p>(</i>The only use case I can think of where I'd prefer to use raw SQL over an ORM is with report generation type activities: usually those types of queries aren't very dynamic, they can often be too complex to be expressed via the ORM's API, and once you have the data you're just dumping it to display without worrying about interactivity anyway.)",1340732769

Then you only call receive when poll has told you there are messages waiting, and then you call it without blocking.<p>I think in my case the confusion behavior came from the fact that I started using a project that used ZeroMQ and build part of its implementation on REP/REQ sockets and showed that behavior.

Developers who ""hate"" code will always push to deal with the smallest amount of it, so they think twice before they touch the keyboard.</i><p>I guess it depends on how you define ""hate"". The amount of effort you put into your job tends to some function of how much you enjoy it and how much money you are paid. At a certain point the money tends to tailor off in effectiveness too.<p>If you hate your job then your main motivator is ""how soon can I go home today?"" or ""how little brain power can I invest in this?"" you will not be interested in the LOC count of the project at all. 
If you enjoy programming then you are more likely to want to expend more effort thinking about how you could write the same thing using less/more maintainable code. There are of course programmers who will over architect solutions but this is usually because they believe that they are creating a structure that will keep LOC count lower over the long run.<p>After all code saving things like MVC/ORM frameworks were originally used by the early adopter more enthusiastic programmers.<p>I would say it's better to hate large bloated codebases, but I can't think there are many programmers who create these on purpose, it is usually a by product of flawed assumptions made in earlier stages or less skilled programmers.<p><i>If he doesn't understand the aspects of the business and doesn't have any stake on the final product he's not a developer, he's just a programmer doing repetitive work at a software factory - ""code monkey"" on jargon - and is not in a position to provide the kind of disruptive, ten-fold improvement software is able to produce.</i><p>Again this is sort of semantics, most companies will advertise positions that are repetitive ""factory"" jobs as ""developer"" positions. In fact some of the better programmers I know refer to themselves as ""code monkeys"" so I guess this is really a cultural thing.<p>It's an interesting point about automation and how much stake a developer should have in a business.
Most businesses now depend fundamentally on software in one way or another, for a glaring example of this see the UK banks that have had to cease pretty close all activity for the best part of a week because of a software problem. Also pretty much also businesses above a certain size have <i>some</i> custom code running somewhere.<p>Does this mean that all businesses should have a developer present at board level? Also should that board level person simply be someone with development experience or should they be involved in the day to day code production so that they can understand all of the decisions made?<p>This also ties into the debate about who should learn to program, for example do you get that experience at board level by teaching executives to write programs or instead do you promote programmers to board level and teach them about ""business stuff""?",1340732373

Most queries need some degree of tuning, whether that be to pull out specific rows, associate related data, summarise, or sort. Do this right, and you can achieve in a single query what would take multiple, dozens, perhaps hundreds of round trips to the database if written with ""trivial"" queries.<p>And let's not forget, it's particularly rare for the ""complex"" query to be more complex than the application code needed to implement the equivalent task. SQL isn't always beautiful, but it can often express ideas more succinctly than most general purpose languages. One GROUP BY can save you from writing big loops. One INNER JOIN or subquery can save you from subsequent database calls. One HAVING clause can save you pages of twisted logic.<p>A ""complex"" query generally avoids the need for a few trivial queries that are comparatively inefficient, both in terms of resources and latency. The goal is to allow the database to do the hard work of extracting every byte you need and nothing else. Databases are good at this shit, and even with a good ORM you're often forced to compromise or maintain two worlds within one app.<p>---------<p>That said, I acknowledge that there are multiple legitimate points of view on this debate. I tend to find that the SQL vs ORM debate tends to fall depending on the sort of code that's being written, and the sort of logic that's needed. Desktop apps tend to suit ORMs more readily than web apps. Smaller and self-contained apps tend to survive ORMs more gracefully than broad-scoped apps.<p>Nothing can excuse stored procedures though.

4163094,comment,4157347,4158761,2,0,gwern,,,"> The Simon/Ehrlich wager did not involve population statistics at all. It involved changes in the prices of commodities. In other words, Ehrlich (the Malthus disciple) lost the bet because in real life, people find substitutes for resources for which prices are increasing. Thus quantity demanded decreases, and eventually price decreases.<p>Ehrlich lost the bet technically, but won in spirit; <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/magazine/can-jeremy-grantham-profit-from-ecological-mayhem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/magazine/can-jeremy-granth...</a> :<p>> The argument often circles back to the bet made in 1980 between the biologist Paul Ehrlich, who foretold catastrophic scarcity caused by overpopulation, and the economist Julian Simon, who argued that any short-term increase in resource prices caused by population growth will stimulate inventors and entrepreneurs to find new ways to exploit those resources, lowering prices in the long run. The two men picked five commodities and wagered on whether their prices, taken as an indicator of scarcity, would be higher or lower in 1990. Simon won, 5-0, even though the worlds population grew by 800 million during that decade.
>
>Malthusians have been trying to live down that defeat ever since, but, as Grantham points out in his July letter, if we extend the original bet past its arbitrary 10-year limit to the present day, Ehrlich wins the five-commodity bet 4-1, and he wins big if the bet is further extended to all important commodities. Grantham concludes that the longer-run story of the bet proves, in fact, both that man is mortal and must make short-term bets, and, more importantly, that Ehrlichs argument was right (so far). That final parenthesis, a nod to uncertainty, leaves open the remote possibility that the apparent paradigm shift might still turn out to be just a bubble in commodity prices.<p>Or<p>> An equally weighted portfolio of the five commodities is now higher in real terms than the average of their prices back in 1980 (see chart).
>
> The Cornucopians might argue that todays metals prices are due to the buoyancy of demand in the developing world rather than any cataclysmic shortages in supply. But the Malthusians might retort that mans famed ingenuity has not stopped prices from rising in real terms over an extended period.

4163054,comment,4162488,4162488,47,0,nikita,,,"MemSQL CTO here. Great article- Domas has done a good job of digging into the internals of MemSQL! A few questions/comments:<p>1.) The range query issue you pointed out can be explained by a well known limitation of skip lists. Unlike B-Trees, skip lists are unidirectional. By default, our indexes are ascending, so indeed you have to skip to the end to run a MAX() or ""ORDER BY id DESC"" query. To fix this, just change the primary key to be descending in your schema:<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE x (id int, ..., PRIMARY KEY id (id) DESC, ...)
    </code></pre>
This is explained here <a href=""http://developers.memsql.com/docs/1b/indexes.html#skip-list-indexes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.memsql.com/docs/1b/indexes.html#skip-list-...</a>. If you want both behaviors in your app, you'll have to create two skip list indexes (for now).<p>2.) The transaction-buffer > 0 setting is really where we shine. Synchronous durability is something we have for flexibility, but I'll be the first to admit that it's not really optimized to perform well. The customers that we're working with are okay with this. And it's inspired by what modern companies do. Maybe it's changed in the time since I've left (Domas?) but Facebook certainly does not write comments synchronously to disk.<p>3.) Our synchronous durability does indeed flush in 50 MS cycles, so you'll see poor performance on single threaded inserts. However, as you pointed out, we're optimized for the case with multiple concurrent writers. Since MemSQL implements group commit on high parallel load throuput picks up. Sure, writing your own very specific benchmark you can show us writing poorly, but we've never worked with a customer that's needed single threaded, synchronous writes to shine. If this is your use case, unless you need substantial read performance, MemSQL is not the database for you.",1340731625

4163046,comment,4162898,4163018,6,0,marceldegraaf,,,"I think the main reason for this is that strange things can happen when you're passing marshalled objects around. For instance, say that your application has just created an Email object which has a ""title"" attribute, and it has been marshalled and put it into a queue. Your queue is a bit full, so it takes a while for the email to be processed. Right after it has been enqueued, you roll out an update to your code, changing the ""title"" field to be called ""subject"". As soon as your Email object is pulled from the queue, you will get NoMethodErrors from your asynchronous mailer code because the unmarshalled object doesn't have a ""subject"" method yet.<p>The reason queueing systems like Resque and Sidekiq pass id's around (instead of objects) is to make sure that the asynchronous worker always has a fresh object straigh from the data store. I guess that's why Rails core has decided to implement it like this as well.",1340731509

It's a view I held <i>myself</i> until things got bad enough to make me leave. Things are always fine, until they aren't, and then they have a tendency to compound very quickly.<p>> <i>""Amazon is a giant company, so this statement is kind of broad""</i><p>It really isn't. Amazon's attrition problems are company-wide, and not limited to a few bad orgs. Amazon's on-call problems are also company-wide, with only a minority of teams spared from it (actually, I was on one of those teams, thank God). Amazon's policy of not readjusting employee compensation to fit a rising market is <i>also</i> company-wide. So yes, they are a huge company, but that is not a defense.<p>I was a returning intern, so I knew a lot of fellow ex-interns returning full-time. My opinion of Amazon is formed by both my own experience and also a whole lot of commiseration with others from across the company stretching over every org.<p>In fact, of all the interns I returned with, only 3 remain, 3 years in. In fact, <i>several</i> quit without even fulfilling their first year. They willingly handed back their signing bonus clawbacks (+tax!) just to GTFO.<p>My impression is that senior-level engineers see a whole different world. SDE1/2 employees are just cogs, but SDE3 and up are treated like Faberge eggs. Unfortunately, I was only a lowly SDE1.<p>> <i>""just like with any other giant company (insert Yahoo, Oracle, etc. here).""</i><p>Amazon is trying to hire at the level of Facebook and Google. Comparing oneself to Yahoo and Oracle (both known for being particularly poorly managed, and the latter having a reputation for being a bit of a code sweatshop) is not praise.<p>Hell, Amazon's hiring process may be <i>harder</i> than Google's. A full-day of 5-6 interviews, including lunch interviews, with a single member of the group having full veto rights over all other interviewers. It's a wonder they have anyone passing said gauntlet. With that high of a hiring bar, new hires trickle in, and the attrition rate pretty much negates any hiring anybody does.<p>> <i>""a couple years back they had a focus on operational excellence to reduce oncall pages company-wide.""</i><p>Platitudes. I was there. Nothing <i>actually</i> changed. I know a few sub-orgs had <i>actual</i> drives to decrease technical debt and drive down operational pain, but for everyone else it didn't do squat.<p>Amazon's on-call misery stems <i>from</i> the high attrition rate. It's a vicious cycle. Most teams accumulate technical debt since they are constantly under-resourced, what with people leaving all the damned time. Most teams I've seen have perpetual open headcount, and never enough hands to really root-cause and fix the chronic problems that are waking up their on-calls at 5am on a Saturday.<p>Combined with upper management that keeps trying to drive features and this is a recipe for disaster. The pace at Amazon is relentless (which is often good), but it affords almost no opportunities to refactor, redesign, rearchitect for better operational performance. Hell, if you want a prime example of this, look at how the Catalog systems are set up. It's like a brick wall extended by wooden beams extended by rebar extended by I-beams.",1340731442

In particular, you often seem to assume that others (me, in this particular case, but I've seen you do it to people before too) are not successful or do not know what we are talking about because we happen to disagree with you or someone you agree with. That is a very annoying habit, and it does nothing to promote interesting and informative discussions. I hope you will forgive my bluntness here, but you seem like a man who prefers honesty.<p>As it happens, I run multiple businesses today, one of which does work on bespoke projects for outside clients, and we do just fine with our calibre of clients and we send them invoices for a lot more than $1,000. In other words, I have no axe to grind here. But I don't see how that is relevant, really, anyway.<p>I simply objected to Patrick's characterisation of people who have problems with clients as being at fault themselves. I also object to the implication, which you seem to be making as well, that $780 is somehow a trivial amount of money and not worth bothering about, which is obviously not true for a lot of people out there particularly in the current economic climate.<p>It is not OK for someone to act unprofessionally, including not paying legitimate invoices within a reasonable period, regardless of the size of the deal. It would not be OK at $100,000. It would not be OK at $1,000. It would not be OK at $10. Whether or not it is worth involving lawyers as a practical matter has nothing to do with the ethics of the situation.<p>I therefore found the implication that someone new to the industry -- a position we were all in once -- somehow brought such poor behaviour upon themselves merely by taking on a relatively small job to be distasteful, the casual dismissal of the value of sub-$1,000 contracts to be rather conceited, and the whole post unnecessarily discouraging towards beginners who are taking their first steps into what often feels like a new and uncertain world.",1340730695

Hope you enjoy.",1340730407

Descent into a ball of mud becomes the status quo.<p>On the other hand, optimizing the source text prematurely(either via code golf or Big Architecture) is even worse since it's not even built on a stable foundation of intention, then, but on guesses or convenient hacks.",1340730145

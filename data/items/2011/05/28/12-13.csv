2594377,comment,2591102,2594358,1,0,raganwald,,,"I was thinking along these lines. Although, the thing that occurred to me is that Lisp is sometimes called a <i>programmable</i> programming language. And emacs is the canonical <i>programmable</i> text editor. It had occurred to me that it was not a coincidence that someone who had embraced a fully programmable tool (language or editor) would feel this way about it. I thought the article was interesting in that the author was pointing out that emacs' programmability could be used to emulate design features like a distraction-free environment and not just ""power"" features.",1306587587

Some small startups with a fraction of Yahoo's size are also able to charge for services and have revenue sources beyond advertising. A service for which Yahoo users(consumers not businesses) are willing to pay, is there one? Maybe Yahoo needs to be in the same space as PayPal, they have the perfect consumer base(trust and penetration) to action something that facilitates micro-payments. The goal should be to make it as ubiquitous as a yahoo email address was in the past.<p>The problem isn't going to be solved by bringing in management folks, Yahoo needs a technology upgrade. They haven't done anything amazing for quite some time now - Yahoo is a fairly old company. Not enough hackers graduating from college have Yahoo  on the top of their list.<p>PS: I know they do hosting and other stuff but that isn't a significant contributor to their revenue.",1183381093

I'm also kind of paranoid I'd attract some kind of Chinese government attention just by having the domain. Probably unfounded paranoia though.<p>",1183377946

This of course implies that the plaintext password never hits Google&#x27;s servers, which it probably does.<p>In general, I&#x27;m not sure this is a valid threat model. If you&#x27;re not trusting Bob with your Wi-Fi passwords, why are you trusting him with everything else? If anyone compromises Google, there&#x27;s far more valuable data on your account than the Wi-Fi list. Even if that&#x27;s all they gain access to, it&#x27;s pretty hard to exploit remotely. If someone is targeting you at this scale, you have bigger problems to worry about.",1374076715

According to NCMEC, just 115 children are the victims of what most people think of as &quot;stereotypical&quot; kidnapping, which the center characterizes thusly: &quot;These crimes involve someone the child does not know or someone of slight acquaintance, who holds the child overnight, transports the child 50 miles or more, kills the child, demands ransom, or intends to keep the child permanently.&quot;<p>My mom is absolutely freaked out about our wife and I living in the city, because someone might kidnap our daughter. Because a crowded apartment building where hundreds of people can hear a child cry for help is so much less safe than an out-of-the-way suburban house when it comes to a crime that never happens.",1374076702
6058405,comment,6058137,6058222,4,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"I can see it now: a venture firm with the slogan, &quot;Taking the capital out of venture capital.&quot;<p>Back to reality. Any entrepreneur raising capital from a venture firm should recognize that venture capital returns over the past decade lag all of the major domestic stock indexes by a substantial margin. If you look at returns from even the most successful of funds, there&#x27;s usually not a lot to be impressed by. In some cases, one or two investments account for most of the returns.<p>Why does this matter? Simple: it strongly suggests that the value-adds so many of the firms try to differentiate themselves with can only do so much to produce real value. If this wasn&#x27;t the case, you&#x27;d expect all that special sauce of the top firms to ultimately be reflected in their returns, which again are generally unimpressive.<p>There is an excess of capital in venture capital today, and you have lots and lots of firms chasing deals. The wisest entrepreneurs who need funding will take advantage of this to raise capital on the most advantageous terms they can negotiate. Agreeing to less favorable terms based on the pedigree of the source of the funding is unlikely to confer any benefit.",1374076701

Do you really want to trade all your stored passwords for the convenience of not having to enter 1 additional password (&#x27;my Android backup password&#x27;) once every one or two years when you activate a new or additional device?? I wonder how this objection rhymes with having logins on 20+ different websites?<p>While I don&#x27;t believe that Google wants to harvest your WiFi passwords (but also don&#x27;t rule it out), I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that paranoid to assume that Google deliberately chose to not encrypt backups by default, so they can extract useful information from Android device backups.

Obviously the servers were setup to not allow this, but the sheer volume of the traffic making attempts was still enough to saturate the connection with our provider at the time.<p>This is only one of many possible scenarios with self-hosted DNS.

The device is a software/design project more than a hardware one now.<p>Also it seems like they are trying to push the content to the kids rather than letting them explore themselves. The problem with the content push is now you have to provide all the content. You have just created a replacement for a text book. They can still fire up a webbrowser or dig through layers to what they want but it&#x27;s not the same.<p>Without a keyboard it is going to be massively less productive. Say goodbye to teaching them programming skills. Kids learning to program on a tablet will probably begin to hate the entire concept as they are fighting a sluggish interface. I love reading comics on my tablet, but I still use a keyboard/mouse device for browsing. A plug in keyboard might help but it isn&#x27;t enough since its a hassle (Also will they be providing keyboards to students?)<p>I don&#x27;t think they are going to be able to fire up a copy of GCC (I remember having a go at C++ when I was like 12, my main problem was getting a compiler and tutorials since I had no internets, now days it should be easy). I learned heaps with qbasic since that was just sitting on my system.<p>imho tablets are largely hype/marketing. They are a massive growth industry right now because it&#x27;s a new market and everyone is trying to grab the market share but we aren&#x27;t going to see desktops/laptops replaced, just augmented. The tablet market will likely die back when it has reached saturation. They have basically &#x27;perfected&#x27; the tablet already. People won&#x27;t really need to upgrade their current generation devices, they already have fast, smooth web browsing, gigs of ram, retina displays and so on. I don&#x27;t see a new version of Android being released over the next 5 years that will no longer be compatible with the hardware out now (although manufactures might not release the updates for those devices) other then a few gimick hardware features things like NFC or that TV streaming stuff which will be desirable to some but not all. About the only thing would be more storage space which will also reach a point when its enough for most people. Then it will mainly be people replacing broken devices or just needing the latest. Maybe we will see a glassed free 3D display and then a retina version or it. Maybe they will make a transparent one.<p>In any case the XO project isn&#x27;t supposed to be about making a product to sell. It seems like it&#x27;s been taken over by designers.<p>Maybe for the XO-4, they will do something like a dockable tablet. With Ubuntu&#x27;s Mir based Android hybrid.

It&#x27;s not uncommon for enough high-frequency current to leak through to be felt, but based on the description it sounds like you&#x27;ve got full AC leaking through. I strongly recommend you don&#x27;t use this charger, since there&#x27;s a real risk of electrocution in that case.

Once they do, and have a good round-trip-time estimate for how long it takes to respond, they stay using it. But they have a hair-trigger; if the nameserver doesn&#x27;t respond, they&#x27;ll very quickly fall-back to trying the other nameservers.<p>In practice what that means is that up to two of your nameservers may be completely unresponsive and the effects will be pretty negligible.

Thankfully, the novelty wore off, but now I have to remind myself, &quot;Hey, you have a camera, you should get a picture of this.&quot; or find myself realizing it a little too late.",1374073274

It&#x27;s the one thing that I wish bash could emulate, instead of the &quot;Show me all the options&quot;.  For me, it&#x27;s a lot more functional, because it doesn&#x27;t require me to figure out what the differences are between file names.  For example, trying to find the difference between R0BCRWPY_1373654012 vs R0BCRWPY_1373647568 is very tedious, especially if you have a bunch of similarly named files.",1374073274

I could pay to use a co-working space, but the value just doesn&#x27;t seem to be there for me.  When I want to be around other people, I go work at the cafe at Barnes & Noble near my apartment, or at SplatSpace (hackerspace in Durham), or Beyu Cafe (a popular restaurant in Durham, which is popular with the startup set here), or something of that nature.<p>When co-working space would be valuable to me, would be when we start needing  a private space for meetings (ie, a conference room) on a relatively frequent basis.   And even then, I&#x27;m not sure we couldn&#x27;t come up with a better arrangement.  Depends on how much the local co-working place is charging and what kinds of models/plans they have in place.",1374073245

There is zero chance that the EU will risk forcing a prosperous, educated country that is already compliant with EU laws out and make them spend several years re-applying, especially when there is a real chance that England will be leaving.<p>The EU is a business, a very lucrative one.  They need the rich countries to pay for the poor, uneducated, mafia-riddled ones to the south and the east.  They already lost oil-rich Norway years ago, they won&#x27;t make the same mistake again.<p>Just watch, the EU will arrange for &quot;special status&quot; to kick in on the very first day of independence, nothing will change.",1410235139

Language.<p>The first point simply means that whatever was done with the internet, the USA got the first crack at it. In american TV it&#x27;s common now to tell people two tweet about the show they&#x27;re watching, with hash tags on screen and whatnot. In germany, europe&#x27;s technology powerhouse, it&#x27;s still extremely common for a person to have never even heard of twitter, if they have internet at all.<p>Further: Anything you do in tech has profits that scale with the audience you can reach. Companies starting out in the USA are able to access all of the USA, all of the UK, and anyone from any other country who has learned one of the most wide-spread languages on the planet; with exactly zero special consideration at any point. Companies in Europe have two choices: Either they build with localization in the product from the start, which is hard, and provide both their local language and english, which also costs more; or they ignore the local market and work entirely in english; or they stick to their own language entirely and ignore the world.<p>In addition to that, due the great employee safety neat, which also means that employees have protection from things like capricious firings, taking risks is more expensive for european companies.<p>Whichever way they go, european companies either have to live with less growth potential, less ability to take risks, or spend more to get the same opportunities as their american counterparts.",1410234608

The Scots have done just as much to make it what it is, with Scottish oil being what made sterling a stable petrocurrency and, therefore, allowed the UK to become a power a financial powerhouse in the Eighties.<p>Realistically, after the bluff and bluster of campaigning has passed, the UK will strike some sort of deal with Scotland because, quite simply, they don&#x27;t want to be left holding the national debt.  If England claims Sterling as it&#x27;s own, Scotland can legally walk away from any responsibility for the banking bail-outs.  None of that will happen, however, because it is in the economic interests of both to co-operate.<p>REMEMBER, England was furious when Ireland left the UK, and did everything they could to renege on the terms of the peace treaty, including the size of Northern Ireland.  The one thing they didn&#x27;t fuck with was their own economic self-interest.  Ireland, as the UK&#x27;s biggest trading partner, continued to use the pound Sterling for more than 50 years after independence.  Think about that.<p>Worst case scenario, the loonies from UKIP somehow get into power and insist on punishing the Scots for daring to leave.  The Scots will simply create a currency that is pegged to sterling, just like the ten other countries who have been doing so for decades, or like the 14 countries that have pegged to the dollar, or the 20 countries outside the currency union who have pegged to the Euro.<p>You could say that pegging would be bad, because they would not have any control of monetary policy but, actually, that is the entire problem with the current arrangement.  The shift from industry to financial services, propped up by Sterling being a petrocurrency on the back of Scottish oil, is what decimated Scotland.

These firms pretty much figured out that it&#x27;s impossible to predict success, so they&#x27;re putting large amounts of capital into companies that are already succeeding.

Most students ended up hating electricity. I have had more than one person cite the &quot;oscilloscope lab&quot; as the experience that turned them away from physics.<p>It&#x27;s too bad, because if well taught, electricity could really reinforce another aspect of physics that students struggle with, namely the ability to solve complex problems by replacing fields with scalar quantities (e.g., stuff that&#x27;s conserved), thus replacing calculus with accounting.<p>Also, I would completely ditch the oscilloscope (at the intro level), replacing it with something that simply measures voltage versus time into a computer.",1410231922

In China social media is used to highlight broken promises between unelected government officials and those who they supposedly serve. In the US you could elect different politician, but in China the only remedy for a lack of accountability is revolution. To state the obvious, social media is a vehicle for democracy, and this has left the Chinese government terrified.",1410231887

There are various reasons to do it already (compression, debug vs release readability/minification concerns, etc) and future revisions of asm.js (like v2, which introduces Java/C#-oriented heap structures) will make it worthwhile.<p>Compiler -> Bytecode -> Normal JS/ASM.js is the long term strategy for asm support in JSIL, since it will depend on currently-experimental asm features and using asm+polyfills on all browsers would have obscenely bad performance characteristics.",1410231761

135202,comment,135101,135101,0,0,paulgb,,,"#5 is impossible. Martin Gardner has a nice proof of this: observe that each domino must cover a black and a white square, no matter how you orient it. When you remove two opposite squares, you remove two squares of the same colour. Imagine you have put 30 of the dominoes on the board, then two squares remain uncovered. These squares must be the same colour (by the above rules), so there is no way the last domino can cover them both.",1205337487

This reminds me of the Excite team, after the 6 of them graduated from Stanford, they decided to start a company simply because they want to pursue entrepreneurship, without even having an idea of what they will be doing.<p>I think it's important to show that entrepreneurship succeeds when you are persistence, have a strong drive to succeed, and have the determination... rather than how media portrait it as random luck (ex.

It just seems as if the cause is too high a demand for European goods to begin with, so there is not really anything to worry about? At the moment the statistics are still good, apparently, as demand is still rising.<p>The other scenario might be that the markets are saturated, like, if Germany were to produce 10 billion cars per year, but there is only demand for 10 million cars. But then they could lower their prices or just produce less cars (thus saving costs), which would probably be equivalent to the Euro falling?",1205334318

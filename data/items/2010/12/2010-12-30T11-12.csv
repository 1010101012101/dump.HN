2051942,comment,2051500,2051917,0,0,lsc,,,"> how could a genuinely good person possibly wish to stop helping others, or not help them to the utmost of his ability?<p>The point I was attempting to make was that quite often, helping those who are not as good as you are at making money can be profitable for all involved.   Hell, even from a ""help the most people"" point of view, finding a job with a path for advancement for a person is doing a lot more good than giving them resources.   Even avoiding the issue of the recipient's self-worth, if I give away resources, I will eventually run out, but if I make money off helping people?  that scales.<p>Perhaps what I should have said was: 
""If you feel that your friends are holding you back, you are doing it wrong.""<p>the thing of it is, I believe statements like ""person x is better than person y"" are largely without content without context.    I mean, if we are talking about money, you can say ""Person X is better at making money than Person Y""  and that makes sense, or ""person X is better at lifting weights than person Y""  or even ""person X is better at writing essays without coming off like an arrogant asshole than person Y""    -<p>I don't know if it was the authors intent or not, but I read this essay as ""I am better at making money than my friends, and this is causing some of my relationships to end.""",1293708518

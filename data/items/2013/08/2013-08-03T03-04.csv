6151055,comment,6150603,6150944,5,0,justinpombrio,,,"There is something to be said for functional code which clearly shows the operations being performed in (reverse) order. In Haskell:<p><pre><code>    (putStrLn . show . sum . map read . filter (not . null) . split &#x27;+&#x27;) &quot;28+32+++32++39&quot;
</code></pre>
or, if you like list comprehensions,<p><pre><code>    (putStrLn . show . sum)   [read x | x <- (split &#x27;+&#x27; &quot;28+32+++32++39&quot;), not (null x)]
</code></pre>
But don&#x27;t underestimate the power of syntax! It&#x27;s much easier to see the structure of your (d0m&#x27;s) first example than of the second at a glance. I won&#x27;t comment on the readability of my Haskell code as I&#x27;m already far to conditioned.<p>(Note that I had to define &#x27;split&#x27; by hand; it is a gaping hole in the otherwise very comprehensive Data.List library.)",1375502335

There was excitement in the beginning, but since pg wasn&#x27;t really taking patches (except bug fixes), the community forked the project and started working cool stuff on their own. Eventually, pg released new versions, which never incorporated the community fork&#x27;s changes, so bit rot crept in, and people gradually lost interest and drifted away from the project. The project isn&#x27;t dead exactly (is Lisp ever really dead?), but it isn&#x27;t the hub of activity it was at the beginning.<p>I don&#x27;t think dilution is main threat here.

6150992,comment,6148946,6150946,1,0,MBCook,,,"Amazon&#x27;s position in the market before this case is one of the things that makes it interesting. If Apple went to into a competitive market and pulled this it would be pretty clear cut. But instead they went into a market dominated by a de facto monopoly. In fact many people believe that <i>Amazon</i> should have been investigated for it&#x27;s practices in the &#x27;pre-iBooks&#x27; era.<p>> They fixed prices [...]<p>This is something I&#x27;m not sure about. From what I&#x27;ve read it sounds like all the publishers already wanted to do this and Apple was just the perfect opportunity to force the issue.<p>But as I said above, Apple clearly knew this was the case and used it to their advantage. They didn&#x27;t set out fix prices, but they weren&#x27;t against it.<p>> And in fact, it didn&#x27;t.<p>This is a little odd too. Because of the agency model and the most favored nation contracts, prices went up. But if prices were artificially low before hand, was this a harm to consumers or a correction that would have happened eventually anyway?<p>There are some interesting twists in this case that make it a lot less clear-cut than most price fixing schemes. Apple probably deserves some kind of punishment for their behavior. On a personal level I&#x27;d really like the ability to buy books in the Kindle app, that seems like a fair punishment. I love my Kindle, but I do think Amazon might have been abusing their monopoly.<p>Of course the publishers were all guilty as hell, but they settled quickly. If they had tried to fight this too, I wonder if we&#x27;d hear as much about Apple. They&#x27;re the only ones left standing and fighting.",1375500832

(BuddyPress, anyone?)<p>My point is that Drupal out of the box requires a lot more configuration simply to something, <i>anything</i>, that an end user can understand. It continues to reveal a very large control surface which, as you correctly point out, is confusing to people who just want to know how to edit some pages. Drupal hands you the toolbox and expects you to work out what you want to build. Wordpress hands you a chair and says &quot;here, sit on this&quot;.<p>> <i>Habari, TextPattern and Serendipity look like purely blogging platforms, but if they&#x27;re better, I hope to start hearing about them in the near future.</i><p>If you haven&#x27;t heard of them before, it seems safe to assume that you won&#x27;t hear much about them in future.",1375499629

You're quite right that subviews always exist in complex applications, but they're best handled in different ways depending on your templating / HTML-generation library of choice, and your app's architecture. Backbone doesn't want to force you to necessarily have a complete static hierarchy of View objects from the root DOM element down to the bottom ... many applications don't need or benefit from it. That said, if you've got a piece of functionality that you think would help with subviews in most Backbone projects, it would make for a great ticket or pull request.<p><pre><code>    > You would bind the events on the list (just once, \n    > for all items) and find a way to know on which \n    > item the event was triggered.\n</code></pre>\nYep, and Backbone encourages that kind of delegation by default at the view level ... mostly for reasons of statelessness rather than performance. It's awfully nice to know that all of your events are always bound and ready on any given view, regardless of whether or not that view has any HTML yet, or has even been inserted into the DOM yet.<p>That said, binding to individual elements isn't problematic unless you're truly doing too much of it. 20 songs each with their own bound callbacks would be fine, but 2,000 songs wouldn't be. When to delegate for performance follows the same reasoning as it would in a plain 'ol jQuery app, and is touched on briefly in the FAQ: <a href=""http://backbonejs.org/#FAQ-tim-toady"" rel=""nofollow"">http://backbonejs.org/#FAQ-tim-toady</a><p>For what it's worth, here's an example of a Backbone view that's using delegation and a single event listener as a callback for all of the individual blocks in the charts: <a href=""http://blog.documentcloud.org/blog/2011/10/entity-charts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.documentcloud.org/blog/2011/10/entity-charts/</a>",1339688857

But the stitching underneath it? It's superfluous, takes up extra space, and adds significant distraction and visual noise. Glad to see it's gone in Mountain Lion.<p>Likewise, I thought iBooks on iPad looked great at first glance, but over time the extra visuals got annoying and cluttery. I was very happy to see them add Full Screen Mode.",1339688295

That is, you can start reading at byte 0 and read one set of valid instruction or you can start reading at byte 1 and read another completely different set of valid instructions.<p>This means that the logic to decode more than one instruction in a clock cycle is really complicated, and complicated means power intensive.  For instance, in AMD's Bulldozer chip the instruction decode unit uses more power than the integer execution cluster.  Now, ARM has its troubles too (instruction predication on every instruction means another logical dependency, meaning that if you go out of order your scoreboard is more complicated) but they're not as bad and don't really exist in alternate encoding like Thumb2 or the 64 bit one.<p>Intel is able to compete so well because they tend to have better fabs, they tend to reach a given node like 22nm before everyone else, and their performance on that node tends to be better than other players too.

We have a few that I downloaded for free, one was on sale, one has IAP and one is ad-supported.<p>The ad-supported one shows ads in a separate ""pick your color"" UI and I'm happy with the design.  It's a flood-fill app like yours and while the drawings aren't as good as yours it's functional enough.<p>The one[1] with IAP is a ""color in the lines"" style app with a lot of UI: Picking brushes, viewing past drawing and picking a drawing are pretty rich.  I ended up springing for the IAP (probably the first time I've ever indulged in it; there's probably a marketing lesson in there somewhere).  The app showcased a bunch of locked coloring books that my daughter kept asking me about, so I bought them so she had more to do in the app.  One interesting thing was that they partitioned the app's IAP.  You could buy one set of markers, or collections of books for a certain amount, or buy the entire IAP library for a marginally higher price.  For the record, I found the IAP design to be ok.  The price is a little higher than what I'm personally accustomed to, but not unreasonable.  What <i>does</i> bother me about this app is that it continues to show me ads for other apps by this developer.  Please don't do that.<p>Hope this feedback helps you decide how to design your IAP.<p>Let me also add that it's mind boggling how the iTunes UX designers decided that IAP descriptions should be truncated.<p>[1] <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazing-coloring-studio/id507378571?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazing-coloring-studio/id507...</a>",1339687171

4111691,story,,,1,1,tokenadult,"Remind HN: Please Submit Original Articles and Titles and Canonical URLs",,"Some recent threads here on HN reminded me to review the Hacker News guidelines linked to from the bottom of the main page and other pages here. There are two guidelines that are good reminders of how to resolve some of the issues that have received meta-discussion here. Let's discuss the guidelines and how to apply them. The headings I've written below emphasize practices that I think are helpful:<p>1. PREFER ORIGINAL, JOURNALISTIC TITLES<p>""In Submissions<p>""Please don't do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase or exclamation points, or adding a parenthetical remark saying how great an article is. It's implicit in submitting something that you think it's important.""<p>A few paragraphs below that, the guidelines say, ""You can make up a new title if you want, but if you put gratuitous editorial spin on it, the editors may rewrite it.""<p>One user benefit of original titles is remembering which articles have already been submitted, perhaps with no discussion (the most frequent case for any new submission) or perhaps with much discussion and placement on the front page of HN just yesterday. Another user benefit of original titles on new submissions is that other things being equal, most titles devised by journalists actually grab attention better (and with less spin on the discussion) than most titles made up by HN participants. New submissions on the Hacker News new page are now so frequent that any article is at risk of being missed, no matter how good it is, but I've seen really, really, really good new articles fail to gain the discussion I think they deserve mostly because they are submitted with a modified title, obscuring what they are about or making the articles sound more dull than the original title did. (Some good articles have an article title that heads the article and a cross-reference title used from the publication main page, and sometimes the cross-reference titles are better than the main article titles at BRIEFLY describing the article. We all get to try to use our best judgment when given a choice of titles.)<p>2. PREFER ORIGINAL SOURCES WITH CANONICAL URLs<p>The Hacker News guidelines say ""Please submit the original source. If a blog post reports on something they found on another site, submit the latter."" Blogspam is highly disfavored here on HN, as I have observed repeatedly in comments after 1305 days here. Everyone prefers submissions of sources that actually do some fact-checking and research before writing, rather than just copying other people's writing. In particular, ScienceDaily and PhysOrg are not original sources and are often not reliable sources. There is a better source for any article you find in either ScienceDaily or PhysOrg, and many Hacker News readers have learned to disregard articles from either of those press release digest companies.<p>A trickier issue is what URL to submit from sources that give articles multiple URLs. For a while the online site of The Economist (a very good source appreciated by a lot of HN readers) was quite inconsistent in how it assigned URLs to articles, giving many articles two or three different URLs depending on how they were linked internally on the site. Other sites distinguish print versions of articles or mobile-viewable versions of articles from the main view of an article with different URLs. I've seen a lot of discussion of preferred URLs of articles here on HN over the years. The suggestion I pick up from other users here is to prefer the ""canonical URL"" (a Web search for that exact phrase will find sources to explain that concept) for each and every article submitted here. Hacker News runs an automated detector of duplicate submissions that works best (upvoting the first submission of an article when a duplicate comes in) if articles are submitted with their canonical URLs. If you read the article first in a news aggregator (e.g., Google News) or in an RSS feed or as a link out on someone's blog, as you submit the URL, chop off the extra characters at the end that reveal the source of the link. Some readers like to read mobile versions of articles, and some readers like to read print versions of articles, and some readers like to read one-page versions of articles. The canonical URL from many of the better sites on the Web should either autodetect a reader's Web client or format to a preestablished user preference. The other URLs may be what you like, but they have unpredictable behavior when submitted to HN and read on many other user's devices--with an especially annoying behavior being starting a print job as soon as the page is accessed. Just submit the canonical URL, and let the user decide what to do from there.<p>Similarly, just submit a good new article, and let users decide from there what to do about it. A lot of good new articles get ignored. No one has time to read all of them. HN users decide for themselves what to read. If some good article was submitted a few days ago, and no one noticed it, take the site title ""Hacker NEWS"" as a suggestion to look for something new, something from today's news, and try submitting that for the discussion it deserves. There are always plenty of new articles to read. (In the occasional case of resubmitting a ""classic"" article on a recurrent issue that has come up again in HN discussion, which is apparently allowed by the duplicate detector eventually lapsing after a set time, then please include the article date as a parenthical comment on the title, e.g. ""How to Disagree"" (March 2008).)<p>Following the habits of other HN users who began here even earlier than I did, if I see a duplicate submission that escaped the duplicate detector (usually because one submission or the other wasn't a submission of the canonical URL), I try to note the earlier submission, with a link, in a comment on the later submission(s). In such cases, I am not expressing any opinion about what other HN readers should do about the observation that the link has been submitted twice (or more). I just note that so that people like me who wonder ""Haven't I seen that before?"" can get a reality check on what they remember. Where (and whether, and how) people decide to discuss articles is up to each reader here. Over the years, I've appreciated comments like that from the previous users who have that habit, so I upvote their comments and have begun emulating them. I don't think the previous users who have that habit mean any offense by that, and I certainly don't.<p>I'd appreciate comments here from other HN readers about what submission practices are most helpful to the community (even if you disagree with me). Best wishes for a great reading and discussion experience here.",1339687065

I guess Linus at least agrees with him.<p>(I realize this might sound like an ""Argument from Authority"", and you'd be right, but we all know Linus is an authority for a reason, and I'm not saying he's right because he's an authority, I'm merely saying he <i>agrees</i> with ESR, which should at least be some kind of signal.)",1339686093

There was Slashdot and some other stuff, but the vast majority of people subscribed to RSS feeds.<p>I posted a few essays and shared the links, but I didnt have a readership until I had an RSS feed and people could subscribe. So I consider myself to have started blogging when there was an RSS feed.<p>(A few years back I abandoned that, as I felt that the best way to reach people was via aggregators like HN and Twitter.)",1339686088

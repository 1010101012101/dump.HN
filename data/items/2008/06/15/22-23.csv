218237,comment,217914,218165,0,0,tx,,,"Axod, you're absolutely right, I am amazed that your voice is drawning in this river of absurd. Twitter <i>IS</i> a freaking reimplementation of SMS, a not-too-hard problem that has been solved many many many times before (on a much weaker hardware). Most folks here just don't get it. Perhaps it's because texting has never been really big in US like it has always been in Europe.<p>Moreover, Twitter's load is a joke compared to what leading telecoms have been dealing with for many years. If there were serious about recruiting they could have hired someone with experience to do just that. Without this typical ""distributed everything"" mantra. Twitter isn't freaking Google or Amazon, they have ZERO computational complexity,  they simply move (and store) up to 400 bytes of data for _not even a million_ of active daily users, how hard could it be?<p>I suspect the reason we see such embarassing technical failures is because software engineering these days is less about engineering and more about playing Lego with pre-existing open source parts, even if they don't fit together or even don't fit at all.",1213570593

The only thing I have found to help me is some form of sleeping pills. I'm not sure what they are doing to my body, but it's really the only way I can fall asleep after 8 pm.<p>I've always wondered if there was a job out there for me that didn't involve working the third shift in some factory, but I have not found a tech or finance job offering the third shift. Until I do find this type of job, it looks like I will need to continue taking sleeping pills.",1213570568
218235,comment,218226,218226,0,0,willarson,,,"First, the first amendment has absolutely no relevance here, since it is a restriction being placed on government, not on individuals. There is a chronic habit to misinterpret this as ""I can say what I want, wherever I want, whenever, however"", which is an interesting <i></i>opinion<i></i>, but one with no correlation with the legal definition. The 1st isn't intended to--and doesn't--defend the imagined right to express your views on other people's servers.<p>Next, your real life examples are a bit sensationalist. The difference is that Saddam was killing people for expressing opinions, whereas we want to downvote poorly expressed and undefended opinions. A more apt comparison would be the university setting, where challenging opinions will be accepted on the merits of their presenter's ability to defend them. The same applies to Galileo, who was persecuted for his theories (not, note opinions). I believe that we'd be overjoyed to have a Galileo posting here, since he would link to his mathematics and let us examine the feasibility of his theories for ourselves.<p>Finally, to address the meat of your argument against downvoting, I think you have misdiagnosed why people are downvoted. I rarely see people downvoted for their opinions, but frequently see people downvoted for failing to <i></i>effectively defend or explain their opinions<i></i>. Since we are trying to foster discussion, the actual opinion is usually less important than explaining how they have arrived at their opinion, and why their opinion is viable. Simply expressing an opinion is noise in a conversation often boils down to noise, and opinions on their own won't feed the starving mind: the meat of the argument lies in explaining opinions.<p>Thus, I believe that the downvote allows the community to exert a stronger preference for comments that add value. If you want to avoid being downvoted, express you opinion <i>and then defend it</i>.",1213570460

218232,comment,217914,217981,0,0,tx,,,"Such an utter lack of understanding of SMS messaging I've rarely seen. Twitter is a joke compared to what it takes to do SMS properly. Not only SMS needs to be persistent, but they also need to be stored and accurately retreived for up to 5 years, which is a goverment regulation in most countries. Moreover, delivery rate needs to be 100%, period. SMS is not a time waster, even pacemakers send SMS messages from inside of human bodies when their batteries need to be replaced. You can't afford to drop those.<p>I know that the ""culture"" of Silicon Valley is not to criticize, so let me put it this way: HIRE CAREFULLY for your startup, especially when it comes to engineering. Even if you're solving a trivial issue.",1213570255

One post since registration, and all you'd need is two sock-puppets in rapid succession to push it onto the front page.<p>I have to say, I've been wondering why this hasn't happened sooner. It's worked for spam, with only a couple of upvotes per article. Why not trolling?<p>Incidentally - and I want to say this very carefully - I believe it should not be out of bounds to examine, for example, the influence of genetic heredity as opposed to environment upon various societal issues. I'm largely discounting this article as a troll based on wild-eyed paranoid claims and red-baiting, rather than claiming enough of a knowledge of the subject to rebut every single one of its claims. (Although if there is, say, an equivalent to talk.origins on this subject, I'd be interested to see it.)<p><i>EDIT</i>: Okay, make that ""paranoid claims, red-baiting and rejecting 'mainstream science' as conspiracy"". Yeah, I'd call that a troll.",1213569652

218226,story,,,24,56,rokhayakebe,"The argument against ""downvote"". A slight violation of the First Amendment",,"There has been several discussions lately about the quality of stories/comments on HN and several users are growing angry at certain stories ranking high on the front page.<p>Several users including PG have proposed to add ""downvote"" for stories, thus prevents news ""lynching"" Michael Arrington, Twitter etc... to go far up the hill.<p>Assuming a story or comment meets the YC standards (grammar, vocabulary...) and is not disrespectful to anyone or any group of people, I think ""downvoting"" is against evolution. It is a few step backwards for a community driven news portal.<p>I have witnessed several times users being downmoded simply because they did not agree with another user. Although they may give a valid reason, they are being prosecuted for having their own thoughts about a particular subject.\nThis is bad to the point where if one cares for karma, which noone should, they may slightly alter their thoughts so they won't be condemned for thinking differently.<p>""Thinking differently"". Now this is not to say that all users must have opposing views, but it is truly acceptable to have a different opinion, and noone should suffer the loss of karma points for having an opinion. This reminds me of Galileo's story.<p>I suggested yesterday that ""silence is louder than downvoting"" and that cost me 3 Karma points. Being  hit for speaking your mind is clearly a ""violation of the first amendment"". Now, how is this different from firing an employee who doesn't agree with a certain company policy. I am confident that if a user could see who downvotes his stories, there will be a lot less of that. If you are doing something you would not do if you knew your identity will be made public, then there is ""integrity"" in question here.<p>Downvote is a clear step backward. How can you evolve in an environment where you risk being prosecuted for speaking your mind? This concept sounds like Iraq under Saddam Hussein. If one does not agree with another, then one should simply reply and make his argument in a civilized manner. Words are your tools, and if ones need ""immunitions"" to get his point across then one needs to learn how to communicate. Only those who  cannot defend themselves using words, would use bullets.<p>I truly apologize if anyone feels offend as it is not the purpose of this article. Each and everyone is  free to speak his mind respectfully and elegantly without fear of retributions.<p>EDIT: The first amendment enforces the FREEDOM OF  SPEECH, which is disencouraged by Donwvotes.",1213568935

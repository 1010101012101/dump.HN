Good luck doing a merge (or god forbid you actually have a conflict). It's fine if you're a single user, but the moment you're working with other people you need to drop down into the CLI a lot (which is fine, but not ideal). I do like using it as an easy way to get an overview of all my repos and a quick way to link into the CLI for each repo, and to quickly check over commits.",1361161414

We&#x27;re a venture backed startup (Spark + OATV) that is making reminiscing online fun by taking your digital exhaust (ditial photos, tweets, checkins, etc) and showing you the most interesting things you&#x27;ve done on this day in history.<p>In an age where we&#x27;re creating more digital data than ever before, we&#x27;re trying to take the 90% of stuff that isn&#x27;t real time and searching for the important signals and making it useful again.<p>Our stack is mostly Rails with PG (and decommissioning Mongo). As of late, we&#x27;re adding more and more Go into our stack.
As part of the iOS team, you&#x27;d be contributing to the iOS efforts on all fronts: making major decisions about how the codebase progresses (libraries, code conventions, etc), major part in hiring, etc. Since we&#x27;re a small startup, you&#x27;d also have a huge amount of input into the product.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for junior iOS folks as well!<p>We&#x27;ve raised $4mm thus far and have got a bunch still in the bank :)<p>Shoot me and email, I&#x27;d love to hear from you! benny@timehop.com (tech cofounder)",1380664779

This is the <i>key takeaway</i> from the article: not all improbabilities are made equal.  <i>Failure to find evidence in one case is not necessarily as damming as failure to find evidence in another case.</i><p>Rolling up all &quot;sea monsters&quot; and all &quot;other great apes&quot; only makes sense if all of these &quot;sea monsters&quot; are said to be basically big tentacled squidy things... The reason we roll all those &quot;other great ape&quot; claims together is because, frankly, it is all the same shit.  Hairy biped, grunts a lot, leaves no trace like a model boyscout, etc.  Same story, different continent.<p>> <i>Accounts, but a dearth of specimen.</i><p>No.  We have had credible specimens of giant squid since the 1800s.

(On a side note I enjoyed the Pascal reference: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettres_provinciales#Other"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettres_provinciales#Other</a> :) I definitely agree with your main point, inventory is the enemy. I&#x27;m not trying to claim that this is an entirely new idea, however, it is a fact that brands are moving online and doing so quickly in a way that has not happened en masse before. I cover in the article that many brands will probably mis-manage this transition and go out of business.<p>My own TL;DR of the article would be something more like this:<p>Brands are moving online rapidly, this will mean they have to hold inventory. This is a new risk they have not taken before and some may fail because of it. They will take this risk because there is margin benefit as well as threats from direct-to-consumer online retailers taking their business. Going forward, direct-to-consumer with higher value to the consumer will be the &#x27;new normal&#x27;.",1380664638

There is a real chance of smartphones getting commodotized and it has already happened to a certain extent in China and India, where local OEMs are calling the shots.<p>The reason it&#x27;s not happening in the US to the same extent is that the carriers hide the true cost of the flagship phones into two year data contracts, unlike, say PCs.

6479233,comment,6477137,6477137,40,0,digitailor,,,"(Forgive me for the length of this post, I didn&#x27;t have time to make it shorter.)<p>TL;DR: The author&#x27;s thesis is that wholesale apparel designer brands can recoup margins by selling direct online. The way this will be accomplished is by the brand itself holding inventory.<p>Here&#x27;s 100 years of experience condensed into four words, so if you&#x27;re considering disruptive ideas in the apparel industry (like this one) please consider that:<p>INVENTORY IS THE ENEMY.<p>I am part owner of a 100-year old vertical apparel outfit in midtown Manhattan, and was there on hand every day for 12 years. We make custom men&#x27;s suits and sell direct to the consumer, but that&#x27;s only been the main revenue stream for a little more than a decade.<p>My great-grandfather started the business as a wholesale manufacturer in Brooklyn circa 1913, and my grandfather grew it into a national wholesale men&#x27;s clothing line, supplying many of the nation&#x27;s stores with their private-branded tailored clothing lines.<p>My father took the big move of selling direct to the customer in the late 70s, from the factory and warehouse on 5th ave in Manhattan. By the early 80s, especially as the result of clever marketing and other market factors, the retail business exploded. The consumers LOVED that the clothing was made in NYC, that they could see it being made, and that it was less expensive because middleman margins had been cut out.<p>So, my father bought a huge former department store on Broadway in the mid-80s, with a three-floor factory above, and was pumping out suits in record quantities (for our business). Also, our suits were wholesaled to Japan, Germany, etc, under our name.<p>Then the market shifted. Suddenly my father was stuck holding quantities he couldn&#x27;t move. (The same thing had happened to my grandfather numerous times.) Overseas manufacturing hit full swing, and even with the cut margins, it was getting impossible to compete. We nearly went bankrupt by the time the &quot;casual trend&quot; hit during the tech boom of the late nineties.<p>In 1999, I came in to help shift the factory back to purely custom-made tailored clothing. NO INVENTORY. MADE TO ORDER ONLY. It was a huge retooling process, and since I was in my early 20s and there are no baby boomers who learned custom tailoring, I had to fill in the generation gap by learning the craft completely, and computerizing the whole pattern-making process. (Doing this custom is a near-impossible task that few do, and I eventually wrote my own software for it.)<p>We <i>had</i> to stop <i>stocking inventory</i> or we never would have made it to 100 (this year) if we had hung on to the idea that a small brand can hold its own inventory.<p>Here&#x27;s an old Jewish garmento joke from the 70s, it&#x27;s caustic but we say it often: &quot;Inventory killed more Jews than Hitler.&quot;<p>There are very few brands out there that can handle vertical operations like this, and fewer people to manage it. Trust me, we&#x27;ve been hiring candidates for ages.<p>Brands will incur all that additional personnel overhead and the <i>incredible risk of stocking inventory</i>, and need the huge marketing budget to sell purely online with no retail locations to build awareness (or at least be reliant on their existing, pissed off accounts for that). The author recognizes this, but glosses over it, and that&#x27;s why I told this long story.<p>The real disruption of the apparel industry is technologically enabled mass customization. This has been talked about for ages but the operational skill to pull it off at scale is not there. I was granted a patent on using bodyscanners to make custom clothing years ago, in anticipation of this disruption, and I&#x27;m still waiting for it to happen, but it seems faaaar off.<p>The author says that a brand holding its own inventory is the &quot;new&quot; industry model. It is actually one of the oldest and most dysfunctional, and fraught with risk.",1380663468

This need to be different could stem from jealousy, and a general uneasyness about their own life acheivements.<p>After all if the tremendously successful <i>aren&#x27;t</i> different, and are instead just like us, then how are they so much more successful? Why are aren&#x27;t we all successful? That&#x27;s an uneasy thought, so humans may want to dismiss it by saying &quot;They must just be &#x27;different.&#x27;&quot;",1380663426

When objects are freed by different threads than the ones that allocated them, typically some sort of slow-path is invoked.<p>Older allocators with per-thread caches used to behave very badly with cross-thread frees, accumulating tons of freed objects in threads that didn&#x27;t necessarily allocate a lot of objects. Tcmalloc uses a garbage collection process to move those objects back to the central free list.<p>The test in the article, where one thread does all the allocations and another does all the frees, basically subverts the thread-caching in tcmalloc, and just tests how quickly the garbage collection process can move freed objects from the free()-thread&#x27;s cache back to the central heap where they can be reused by the malloc()-thread.",1380661882

What technical people need to understand is that the system that we operate in is just as important, if not more so, than our own aspirations and potential contributions.<p>Politics, economics and culture are usually taken for granted by technologists and scientists. Some are informed pessimists, and some are apathetically uninformed. The truth is that these systems serve as the silicon upon which we must build. We often try to abstract our way out of it, but if we want real change, we have to go right down to the hardware and begin making changes.<p>The OP correctly identifies the cognitive dissonance in SV, as well as some aspects of classical capitalism. The reality is that we are running a society based upon assumptions made hundreds of years ago as to what a society constitutes and how it should work. These factors are all changing rapidly, and its becoming clear that our systems aren&#x27;t keeping up.<p>In the USA, we face an unprecedented technological tidal wave in a winner-take-all capitalist society. This has massive upsides for the winners (entrepreneurs, VCs, hedge funds, banks, etc.) and devastating consequences for the losers (unskilled labor, outdated/sidelined skilled labor, the sick, poor, unemployed, etc.).  Furthermore, this type of laissez-faire economy incentivizes short term investments at the cost of long term projects (Apollo, Human Genome, etc.). As the role of government and its spending becomes increasingly demonized, we will undoubtedly see these trends strengthen, leading to more emphasis on the present at the expense of the future. Projects that dont have immediate benefits will be cancelled, and long term research will grind to a halt. We are already seeing this with the plateau and decline of government research institutions, soon to be followed by the demise of publicly funded research in academia.<p>What we really have to ask ourselves is this: what is the most optimal contribution we can make during these times? Is it better to dedicate some time to rethink these foundations, or do we just push forward on our own high level projects in hopes of making small positive contributions? When do we start treating government and politics like an engineered system, which can be planned and optimized for certain outcomes? And finally, when do we start talking about which outcomes we want to see in the long term?<p>I am cautiously hopeful, but it is going to take a lot of individual introspection by the technical community to reach the critical mass required to enact long-term positive change.",1380661255

If white dots are shown in different places on the screen, and assuming the phone and subject don't move during the process, surface normals can be computed from the resulting images, and once you have the normals then the shape can be approximated.  Normals can be found by calculating the angle of maximum reflectance for each pixel for a series of images under different illuminations.<p>See this Google video for a similar technique.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxNg-tXPPWc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxNg-tXPPWc</a>",1294322337

Was my English teacher not as good because I got a D yet the Business and Maths teachers got an A or B out of me? Does the fact that other students got A in English and a D or E in Business or Maths show that actually the English teacher is 'better'? Or was it just an anomaly?<p>Sure, there are no doubt a tiny minority of teachers who (in the UK at least) have paid thousands for a degree, gone through some form of postgraduate training and accreditation (years in total) only to land a job and then throw it all away.

Degrees teach you mostly theory, but applying theory to the real world takes experience, and that doesn't come overnight.<p>Obviously the concepts in math, English, or other subjects may not change much over the years, but the environment certainly does.  Teachers have to learn how to tailor their methods to meet the needs of the whole class.  That means being able to understand where children are in their development cycle, recognizing what learning methods work best for each student, and striking a balance so that the needs of all students are met.  The good teachers are the ones that learn how to do this, and have developed the confidence to maintain order and discipline.  --Providing support and mentoring can make a huge difference between having a new teacher succeed or fail.",1294321759

Success in SEO is largely possible because 95% of webmasters have no idea how to promote content.<p>I've also developed 'digital libraries' for major academic organizations and a common thread there is a complete lack of interest in indexability.  There's a lot of fantastic content trapped in the ivory tower because nobody considered the 'unwritten standards' for how the web worked.<p>A big part of the problem is that it's very hard to get legitimate links these days.  You used to be able to get into the Yahoo directory for free,  but now you have to pay a $300 a year bribe.  Before 2000,  it was common for people to create large collections of links they liked.  Today,  major players like Engadget have a policy of not wasting their PageRank on other sites.  Afraid of spam,  many blogs and forums are on a hair trigger to stop people from dropping links in comments,  relevant or not.<p>If legitimate links are harder to get,  that 'lowers the bar' for spammers.<p>A real answer to spam would be to strengthen the signal so it can break through the noise.  It might be helpful to be able to get more feedback from web users about the quality of pages,  but this is tough.  The horrible truth is that there are more pages on the web than there are viewers,  so even if you could get feedback from 10% of viewers,  many pages would be badly undersampled.  Spammers would also target any feedback channels that exist,  and with low response and sampling rates,  it might be easier to overload the feedback chanel than it is to create link noise.<p>Another answer is to beat Demand Media at their own game,  the same way that Stack Overflow has beaten the spam sites that dominated programming questions two years ago.",1294321699

The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users. For example, in our prototype search engine one of the top results for cellular phone is ""The Effect of Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention"", a study which explains in great detail the distractions and risk associated with conversing on a cell phone while driving. This search result came up first because of its high importance as judged by the PageRank algorithm, an approximation of citation importance on the web [Page, 98]. It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers. For this type of reason and historical experience with other media [Bagdikian 83], we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.</i><p>Google solved the problem by turning it on its head, but now it looks like the spammers have indirectly implemented what Google avoided.",1294319998

I'd say that's understandable.<p>I've never had a counselor actually read notes in front of me. They do have notes, and they do read them, but not while we're in a session. When that happened to him I imagine he felt more like a patient than a peer (for lack of a better word). It's disappointing to me because that's what counselors are for — they're supposed to create an opportunity for someone like Bill to open up. It's clear to me he didn't like holding his trauma as a secret but was afraid of it being used against him somehow.<p>Relationships are just an escape. He was aware of himself enough to know that, which is (was) a good sign. Darkness like his allows you to feel like you're head over heels in love in one moment, and then in another wonder WTF the point is if we're just going to die anyway. It's as if it were a drug. And like a drug, its efficacy fades over time.<p>Good for you for being able to be honest and open about your problems! That takes balls.<p>One technique that's worked while I'm in a depressed state is to just expect & accept it. When I get into a funk and think about how all I do is feel depressed, I tell myself, ""No shit Yogi, of course you're going to feel this way, look at all the crap you have to deal with"". Those few words don't get rid of the sad feeling, but it helps me get past it. I feel like that's all most people need, a way to <i>get on with it</i>.<p>Even after years of therapy, I'm still amazed at how trained our brains can become.

Good teaching is not something you can package up, and lesson plans are very idiosyncratic creative works. They are not readily transferable between teachers.<p>No matter how good the teaching materials you get, from the school/textbook/other teachers, that's just the start of a good lesson. You have to review the material yourself, and tailor it to your own style and preferences, and then revise it based on how well it actually worked. I can still spend hours revising lessons I've delivered several times before.<p>It is possible to deliver a pre-packaged lesson from another teacher or the textbook company. But if you haven't put your own effort into customizing it, the students will recognize it as a sub-standard effort. And they'll treat you accordingly.",1294318806

It&#x27;s a yes or no question, regardless of what use the police make of technology. If you think the police shouldn&#x27;t be able to follow you around to see what meetings you go to, which they can do now without a warrant, then it shouldn&#x27;t matter if they do it with their feet or by automatically capturing and recording license plate numbers.<p>Technical capability doesn&#x27;t alter the definition of right and wrong.

If they&#x27;ve already got the time and experience, very few managers [in the real world, at least from my experienced] have the foresight to use that person to train another developer. Usually they&#x27;d just give that person the work until there&#x27;s so much work they can&#x27;t scale and then someone else would be hired to pick up the shortfall... Of course, the first developer is still so snowed under that they have little to no time to mentor the new guy. So they look for someone who may be experienced in the language but only a mediocre developer by definition. In real world terms, it appears to be expected that a senior developer can just be dumped into the empty seat and get on with it - thus, the expectation also appears to be that this senior developer needs to understand the language and pick up the business knowledge quickly enough to be productive without costing more than absolutely necessary.",1428429298

9335726,comment,9334919,9335489,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"Since outside of math the goal of science is not proof but plausibility, this would not be an effective approach. Science is the discipline of publicly testing ideas by systematic observation, controlled experiment and Bayesian inference, and as such is aimed at changing the posterior plausibility of some proposition, not &quot;proving&quot; anything. Proof and certainty are the Alchemist&#x27;s Stone: philosophers sought after them for thousands of years the way alchemists sought after the secret of turning base metals into gold, never realizing that the fundamental problem wasn&#x27;t in their methods (although their methods had problems) but in their goal, which was impossible and wrong. We should seek knowledge, not certainty.<p>The range of means by which that can be done is huge (though considerably less than &quot;anything goes&quot;) and there is a definite role for work that is exploratory and speculative, up to and including stuff that is almost certainly wrong but worth publishing because a) the error is not obvious and b) publishing creates the opportunity for others to respond to it, hopefully putting the error to rest for good and all. Some of the early work on the &quot;no cloning&quot; theorem was motivated by publications of this type (it turns out if you could clone a quantum state you could use entanglement to communicate faster than light, and there was a series of papers in Physics Letters in the late &#x27;80&#x27;s proposing to do just that.)<p>So trusting in the self-correcting ability of the discipline of science is fundamental to its progress, and therefore insisting on some alchemical standard of &quot;proof&quot; as the goal for publication would fatally cripple the scientific enterprise. For science to work we have to be tolerant of the publication of error.<p>But we need to keep the rate of erroneous publications down to a manageable level. Peer review and society membership were ways of doing this in the past. They have broken down today, and we are still casting about for new ways to keep the error rate well above zero, but not so high as to swamp everything else.",1428428734

9335714,comment,9333330,9335304,0,0,dkrich,,,"There are a couple of distinctions to make here, both practical and probable.<p>First, forming an LLC does <i>not</i> protect you  from liability in and of itself. The idea of creating an LLC is to create a legal entity that is separate from yourself. However you still must act as if you are separate from the business by creating a separate bank account and using it for all business purchases, for example. If you form an LLC but then buy all your supplies and hosting with your personal credit card, in the eyes of the law you are a sole proprietorship.<p>Ideally this would be done early on, as there isn&#x27;t much downside. However there is some. First, there are filing fees and a lot of times you must pay a representative for your business (especially if you are filing in a different state). Then if you want to dissolve your LLC, this can cost hundreds of dollars.<p>Practically speaking you won&#x27;t get sued unless you&#x27;re already successful. The reason is quite simple. If you don&#x27;t have anything worth going after (assets, an insurance policy, etc.), no lawyer is going to take the case without charging sizable fees. For most  people, paying an attorney out of principle isn&#x27;t going to be a realistic option. Therefore, I would say it really depends on your business and the potential liability. If you are starting a company that catalogs baby pictures, your potential liability is probably pretty low. I wouldn&#x27;t worry about filing for an LLC before I had a decent set of customers. If you are starting a company storing sensitive financial data, I&#x27;d definitely file for an LLC and probably take out a large insurance policy to boot (see how those are correlated?).",1428428633

My point was that I have to use CoreOS <i>FOR ORCHESTRATION</i> because my normal options for orchestration don&#x27;t (yet) work with Rocket or any of its implementations. I know CoreOS has publicly announced that they&#x27;ll make Kubernetes work with Rocket, but that&#x27;s not yet reality. And the orchestration option that we&#x27;re currently pursuing, ECS, isn&#x27;t likely to support Rocket any time soon.<p>And CoreOS doesn&#x27;t exactly have a great history of being interoperable...the tools that make up CoreOS have hard dependencies on each other. For example, I find Consul to be better than etcd in almost every conceivable way and yet CoreOS forces me to run etcd. I&#x27;m not going to believe that CoreOS cares about interoperability until they&#x27;re willing to take the same &quot;batteries included but removable&quot; stance that Docker has professed.<p>You seem to have a very pro-CoreOS bias. I&#x27;m not going to try to change that. Let me be clear on my biases. I like the design of Rocket far more than Docker. I don&#x27;t want a single executable to build, run, monitor processes and be a REST API. But I also disagree with almost every decision that&#x27;s gone into CoreOS. Fleet is cumbersome, systemd is a train wreck (the one thing an init system cannot be is non-deterministic and I&#x27;ve seen too many systemd boot sequences be that) and etcd is inferior to other options. So while I respect that Rocket can be used elsewhere, there&#x27;s still little-to-no support outside of CoreOS when it comes to everything that goes into running containerization in a production environment.<p>My company has serious dev-test-prod workflow issues that can be solved by containerization. We&#x27;re publicly tied to running in AWS. CoreOS is simply a non-starter. While I completely agree with all the negative things that have been said about Docker, I can still advocate Docker-based solutions in the meetings I attend on this subject because everything I need from the ecosystem is there, today, ready to use. Rocket simply isn&#x27;t there yet and it could have been if they&#x27;d started with the existing Docker implementation as the basis for their specification. And you&#x27;re not going to convince me that that NIH decision is in the best interests of the community.",1428428433

My observations align with yours in regards to how these trips are marketed (if I can use the term) and how most people I know who have done them describe the experience. But I have another anecdote, one which describes why I don&#x27;t want to hold my speculations or &quot;understanding of the world&quot; in <i>too high</i> esteem:<p>I know at least one person who was so sheltered that the big realizations on her trip (a &quot;mission&quot; trip as it were so) were that: not all children are born in fancy suites with a host of doctors tending to every need; you can&#x27;t get processed American lunches out in the middle of the desert; &quot;kids are <i>literally</i> hungry because they don&#x27;t have enough food&quot;. Hearing this was equal parts astonishing and enraging and yet it made me check my own entitlement as well. Why should I want to attack her motivations? Why should I challenge her because the &quot;result&quot; wasn&#x27;t &quot;good enough&quot;, i.e. she didn&#x27;t suddenly become enlightened as to what it was like to live in such a situation, instead she <i>merely</i> realized that she had a desire to care about the issue and support others who care as well (see: cash donations)? Any minute I could have said <i>obviously, there are people in terrible situations all over the world</i> and it would have done nothing because I already thought it. There will always be &quot;those kinds&quot; of people; we don&#x27;t want to be them, but they also don&#x27;t want to be us. The truth is that even if her interests end up being entirely selfish, she&#x27;ll probably have more of an impact on those things than I ever will. I can appreciate that, even if it&#x27;s not efficient, altruistic, or whatever. It&#x27;s frustrating, but not terrible.",1428428242

I&#x27;m saying, in response to your assertion above, that it is <i>not trivial</i> to derive a useful result about approximating the volume of convex sets with MCMC, and <i>not at all obvious</i> that anything smarter than independent probes will be useful.  I happened to read the original 1991 paper on this topic during my PhD, so I&#x27;m still vaguely familiar with it.<p>To clarify:  It&#x27;s clear than you can approximate a convex volume with exponentially-many independent (random or deterministic) probes.  That&#x27;s therefore not an interesting problem.<p>Surprisingly: there is NO deterministic algorithm that can solve this problem in polynomial time.  But, surprise #2: a randomized algorithm using MCMC can.  Pretty cool.<p>So, this is the relevance of MCMC to the convex volume problem.  Used cleverly, it can take you from exponentially-many probes to polynomial.<p>And in particular: You talk about &quot;creating a bounding box&quot; for the reference Lebesgue measure -- saying that this first step is easy is basically assuming the whole problem is solved.  Because: How do you create a bounding box around a convex set in R^d, with polynomially-many probes, so that the error is bounded?  You can do it with exponentially-many probes (just go out along each orthogonal axis).  But that&#x27;s not interesting -- if you have that many probes, forget about MCMC, just use a deterministic algorithm.<p>Here&#x27;s a short summary: <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~sinclair/cs294/n16.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~sinclair/cs294/n16.pdf</a>",1428427473

It&#x27;s impossible to answer that, because whether or not something is healthy depends on the rest of the diet. For example, is broccoli healthy? If the rest of your diet consists of fast food, then clearly adding some broccoli would be a good idea.

One is that this is an attack, so the browser should by default block the site. One is that the site downgraded to a self-signed certificate because they want to be treated as HTTP. One is that the site downgraded to a self-signed certificate because of misconfiguration, but you know out-of-band that it should be treated as HTTPS (the fingerprint matches what the support phone number tells you, or you&#x27;re on a secure network, or something).<p>Those last two situations are different. In the former, that cookie should no longer get sent, just as it would not be sent to <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com</a>. In the latter, it should be sent.<p>Right now, on the assumption that &quot;intended to downgrade to HTTP with opportunistic encryption&quot; is rare, the browser will put up a scary alert to make sure you&#x27;re verifying the security of the connection out-of-band, and then send the cookie if you click through the warning.

9335565,comment,9334197,9335024,0,0,pdkl95,,,"> 4th Amendment<p>The 4th Amendment - and specifically its warrant requirement - is often misunderstood to be about protecting individuals from government searches. Warrants will generally be granted, and the search of any particular individual is going to happen if the government wants it to. The protection for individuals happens later when evidence that was improperly obtained could be ruled inadmissible by the exclusionary rule. The search will probably happen, but the results of that search may not apply in court.<p>The warrant requirement is an attempt to protect society in general against threats like the writs of assistance that were imposed upon the colonies. From the perspective of an individual search, obtaining a warrant is a trivial speed bump.<p>If you wanted to search an <i>entire city</i>, on the other hand, those speed bumps serve as a rate limiter. It is just not possible for even a large, corrupt, overfunded and overstaffed police force to &quot;particularly describe&quot; what each search is for and get each one rubber stamped by a judge. Our police and judicial systems have many inefficiencies like this by design.<p>In modern times, we probably need to extend this idea to the public space, to impose some kind of new rate-limiter. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the government can <i>ask</i> for occasional data, but allowing a continual collection and a permanent database is the kind of &quot;general warrant&quot; style collection that we need to prevent. The problem is when data is the aggregated, so we need to strongly rate limit the collection so there is no data to aggregate.<p>By the way - while license plate data is bad enough, I hope everybody remembers that they are making a detailed map of their movements <i>and</i> a graph of probably relationships when they carry a cell phone thanks to COTRAVELER.

And this is supposed to be more &quot;fair&quot;?

What actually costs the ISP money is data transferred <i>outside</i> the ISP&#x27;s network, going over peering connections.  Many datacenters don&#x27;t charge for bandwidth within their own network; for instance, bandwidth between AWS nodes in the same area is free.  So why can&#x27;t an ISP use the same model, and only charge for bandwidth going over their peering connections but not for bandwidth that stays inside their own network (such as to the YouTube or Wikipedia mirror they&#x27;re hosting)?<p>For the record, I <i>do</i> believe in network neutrality in the sense that ISPs should not be artificially limiting bandwidth to particular Internet services (though I&#x27;d prefer to see that solved more naturally through ISP competition, but there&#x27;s a severe lack of local ISP competition available).

For example, in the English Midlands, the condition was known as Derbyshire Neck. In the United States, goitre was found in the Great Lakes, Midwest, and Intermountain regions. The condition now is practically absent in affluent nations, where table salt is supplemented with iodine. However, it is still prevalent in India, China Central Asia and Central Africa.",1428426043

Since there was no World Wide Web yet, most computer systems weren&#x27;t exposed to a global network full of people who wanted to crack code for profit.

I was actually really excited to see where people would take that.<p>What I realized later was that it didn&#x27;t happen because a lot of PHP is deployed to shared/managed hosts, and people willing/able to deploy code like Mongrel2 are unlikely to be using PHP. The venn diagram of &#x27;people capable of building out a PHP SAPI&#x27; and &#x27;people interested in bleeding-edge experimentation like Mongrel2&#x27; doesn&#x27;t overlap enough to produce results.",1428426032

HN doesn&#x27;t allow submitters to editorialize (put their own spin on) the stories they submit. The only way to avoid this, since we&#x27;re not experts on all content, is to use language from the story itself that neutrally represents it.<p>This rule kicks in particularly robustly when users start to complain that an existing title is misleading. Long experience shows that this can easily become the dominant topic of a thread. I call that &quot;title fever&quot;. It benefits no one.<p>We don&#x27;t always succeed in coming up with a neutral, accurate title, so there&#x27;s a standing invitation to HN readers to suggest a better one. When someone does, we change it again. But if you want to be sure we see a suggestion (about anything, not just titles), send it to hn@ycombinator.com. There are too many posts on HN itself for us to read them all.",1428426020

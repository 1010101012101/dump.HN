The only problem was, the unmotivated/disorganised students (like myself) often didn't do the reading/studying in our own time and so had to have these extremely painful tutorials one on one with the tutor.<p>Also, I remember when doing Economic Theory, I spent 40 hours reading/studying in a library per week and still couldn't get my head around some of the advanced math and game theory, and really wish I'd had a teacher to teach me those concepts before the tutorial where we'd go through the problems. It turns out I was lacking knowledge of some mathematical transformations that I hadn't been taught because I didn't specialise in double math when I was 16.<p>Nevertheless, I favour this form of teaching.",1299751044

It cost me around $1000 USD several years ago and suffered various problems: graphics crashes, overheating, and worst of all, a malfunctioning tablet. The vent fans were placed and designed such that if I didn't disable the tablet, my cursor would jump down to the lower-right corner where the vent was and constantly wiggle/click.<p>Needless to say, I wasn't impressed.<p>My second HP I bought about a year ago; I was the proud owner of a DV8t, one of the first i7 laptops. Not only did customer support lie to me (infinite glass screen, what?), but this laptop is badly-designed, too. The battery has been completely dead for several months now and I hadn't even owned the laptop for a year at that point.<p>The volume, wireless, and CD tray are all controlled from a touch-sensitive panel. The kicker? The panel often malfunctions, resulting in my sound going haywire, my CD tray popping out randomly, and worst of all, my wireless flipping on and off constantly.<p>To add insult to injury, I can't disable it from the device manager like I could the crappy wacom layer in my previous laptop.<p>So whatever the price difference between Apples and HPs, I'm sure they cover something other than just the numbers associated with the hardware. I'm certainly never buying another HP and I'll tell everyone I know about how terrible HP's machines have been to me whenever I have the chance.",1299750829

In fact, he created the Logo programming language as some sort of ""mathland"" where learning math would be like learning French in France ( <a href=""http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2007/03/the_origins_of_/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2007/03/the_origins_of_/</a>, <a href=""http://j.mp/h6BiOC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://j.mp/h6BiOC</a>)<p>Real mathematicians have often lamented on the approach to mathematics that schools have taken. For example, this essay titled ""A Mathematicians Lament"" starts like this:
""A musician wakes from a terrible nightmare. In his dream he finds himself in a society where music education  has been  made mandatory. [...] Since musicians are known to set down their ideas in the form of sheet music, these curious black  dots and  lines must constitute the 'language of music.' It is imperative that students become fluent in this language if they are to attain any degree of musical competence; indeed, it would  be ludicrous to  expect a child to  sing  a song  or play  an  instrument without having  a thorough  grounding in  music notation and  theory. Playing  and  listening  to music, let alone composing an original piece, are considered very advanced topics and are generally put off until college, and more often graduate school. As for the primary  and secondary  schools, their mission  is to  train  students to  use this language— to jiggle symbols around according to a fixed set of rules: 'Music class is where we take out our staff paper, our teacher puts some notes on  the board, and  we copy  them or transpose them into a different key. We have to make sure to get the clefs and key signatures right, and our teacher is very picky about making sure we fill in our quarter-notes completely. One time we had a chromatic scale problem and I did it right, but the teacher gave me no credit because I had the stems pointing the wrong way.'""<p><a href=""http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf</a>",1299749627

There's something about 10-12 minute lessons, and obviously the thought that goes into distilling it to that size, that makes it digestible.  (I'm really curious how much time goes into making one 10 minute lesson.)  It sticks.<p>One caveat: I've been exposed to this material before in other contexts, so it's more like a phenomenal refresher.  I can't know if this is a better way to teach from scratch.  But, frankly, it's been long enough, or I was just that bad at it the first time, that it sometimes feels like I never learned it in the first place.  This gives me some degree of confidence that it's at least one right way.",1299748125

2308649,comment,2308088,2308088,0,0,URSpider94,,,"Some folks on this thread have suggested that you open your own merchant account.  FWIW, you're likely to face the same problems with that route if the underwriting department takes a good look at your business model.  If you're selling ""experiences"", it's too hard to demonstrate whether your clients did or did not receive the alleged service.  You're likely going to open yourself up to a huge risk of chargebacks -- remember, you're now vouching for the performance of each and every one of your ""experience vendors"".  A chargeback rate of just a few percent would eat up all of your profits, and get your merchant account canceled to boot.<p>It would also be incredibly easy for me to launder money or commit fraud with your system -- I could just set up a fake experience, like navel gazing, at $100 per, and buy up unlimited sessions with stolen credit cards, or give myself a massive cash advance at purchase interest rates, with a small mark-up.  Maybe I'm missing it, but if your system doesn't include some way to reserve the time for the ""experience"", then there's really no way to ensure that your vendors are not double- or triple-booking their time.<p>To summarize, the financial risks of your business model run far beyond PayPal.  If you can come up with ways to hedge against these risks, you might even be able to convince PayPal to take you on (though I wouldn't count on it).",1299747948

The basis of in-state tuition for residents is that, through the required residency period, you have subjected yourself to the tax and other obligations that come from living in the state and have contributed to the community independent of nationality or citizenship, and that the tuition break is part of the service that the State provides in exchange for that to residents.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how permission from the federal government to be in the country is even <i>relevant</i> to that.<p>> I&#x27;m not against in state tuition for visa offenders, but at the same time there seems to be an unfairness with regard to out of state students who would have to pay the &quot;full price&quot;.<p>Currently-out-of-state students could choose to move to the state first and establish residency.

The real question is it legal to write software that interacts with an API which is covered by someone else&#x27;s copyright (assuming you can even copyright an API) without their express permission?<p>Since that happens pretty much every time you write a line of code, I would say it&#x27;s a pretty important question. Whether or not you distribute said software, whether you distribute it in binary or source form, and whether you charge for said software are all interesting confounding variables and it would be extremely interesting to delve into whether those factors impact the result.<p>Keep in mind this is simply software which sends and receives packets over a network.

Coaches should go for it on 4th-and-short more often than they do, but getting stopped on 4th down is demoralizing and makes the coach look foolish, which shifts their decision-making. Getting stopped on a 2-pt. conversion might also reflect poorly on the coach, so they are averse to calling that play even if it is statistically the right move.<p>I find this psychological side of coaching very interesting, and sports are a great venue for examining the psychology of decision-making. A great example of outcome-bias is the sports world&#x27;s reaction to the Seahawks decision to throw the ball at the goal line in last year&#x27;s Super Bowl. I would argue it was the proper decision as it maximized their chances of winning the game (it allowed them time for one passing play and two running plays, as opposed to just two running plays).

It&#x27;s an issue that comes up in timeseries databases pretty often.<p>Say I have a table full of quotes and a table full of trades. I want to know what the quote price was at the time the trade occurred. In no-frills SQL, that translates into something like:<p><pre><code>    select * from t left outer join q on q.time=(select max(time) from q where time<=t.time and sym=s) and t.sym = q.sym where date = d and sym = s
</code></pre>
If you have some sort of support for time proximate joining, the query engine only has to perform a binary search (as long as the indices on the symbol and time columns are appropriate, say symbol partitioned, then time sorted within symbol) to find the correct row from quote to join against. If it doesn&#x27;t have such support, then a scan is required to find the maximum time value from the quote table that satisfies the constraint on the trade time. Presumably, if you do have support, this wouldn&#x27;t be the exact query syntax, because that would heavily imply that you <i>want</i> to  perform a table scan, or that you could change some aspect of the subquery without affecting performance. Maybe you&#x27;d have it be something like this:<p><pre><code>    select * from t left outer join q on before(t.time,q.time) and t.sym = q.sym where date = d and sym = s</code></pre>",1432153591

But your &quot;teaches them to be victims&quot; argument is not one of them.<p>A much more interesting and defensible argument would be that the welfare state in its current incarnation punishes people for getting off of welfare. If the &quot;reward&quot; for finding a job is to take away aid on a 1:1 basis, why would getting a job be a good idea? Another interesting angle is the fact that minimum wage is not sufficient to keep a family out of poverty - especially when you throw in the costs of transportation and child care associated with a job.<p>To find the racial problem, look at history. When the welfare state first came into existence, racism had kept the black community in deep poverty, so poverty was already unevenly distributed. Since the welfare system merely treats the symptoms rather than the causes of poverty, the disparity has continued. And the disparity is driven not by welfare, but rather by institutional racism.<p>There was a great photo by a trio of black artists at the Henderson protests.

You know that `(a b c)` is a list of three elements, that the first element can be extracted with the `car` function, and the rest with `cdr`, and so on. You also know that `(a b)` is shorthand for `(a . (b . nil))`, which helps a lot in knowing how to manipulate it. The fact that you are already familiar with Lisp taints your perception.<p>Not to mention Lisps, especially the new ones, throw obviousness out the window with merry abandon. Let&#x27;s look at Clojure. You think it&#x27;s obvious how to operate on Clojure? Here: `(let [a 1, b 2] (+ a b))`. What <i>is</i> that? I&#x27;ve mostly coded in Scheme, I don&#x27;t know what square brackets are supposed to do. Vectors? How do I manipulate them and <i>what are they doing in my let</i>? And what does the comma do? Oh, nothing? Then <i>why is it there</i>? And if the comma means nothing are you telling me that if I want to list the names that are being defined by this form, I need to extract the even-indexed elements of a vector? Sure I can do that, but don&#x27;t tell me you care about ease of manipulation.<p>Anyway, sorry for the rant ;)<p>I think the point I really want to make here is that sure, s-expressions are quite simple, but if I can explain how s-expressions work in a minute, and how my expressions work in five minutes, this isn&#x27;t really a matter of ease of manipulation, this is a matter of laziness. If a language&#x27;s source-to-AST rules can be fully explained in one or two paragraphs or a small table, and can be easily remembered, then that&#x27;s all that matters.

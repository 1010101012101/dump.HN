It's not life-altering wisdom, but it is pretty much all true and worth thinking about from time to time.<p>The most important thing to take away from it, I think, is that if your success depends on a single unlikely (but wonderful) event, your likelihood of success is very small indeed.

The point I am making: it is not so any more!
How much dev time or marketing or technology insight went into any of these, for example: digg fbook myspace flickr techcrunch?
And yet they´re worth billions of $.",1205313710

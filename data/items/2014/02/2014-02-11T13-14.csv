7217604,comment,7211514,7213595,2,0,notlisted,,,"I disagree somewhat. Buying ads on google&#x27;s search engine makes a lot of sense (for us), as google closes the loop from impression to click to sale (ads served to places where sales occur, keyword bids adjusted automatically based on sales). For my clients, google adwords adverts typically result in 100x-400x sales vs ad spend. A good deal for all involved.",1392127174

It&#x27;s perfectly okay that marketing is hard and return on investment is also difficult. The problem is Facebook actively pursues unsophisticated advertisers while running a platform that&#x27;s actively harmful to them.<p>I see it analogous to SEO. Good SEO being hard is fine. There are noob mistakes you can make that will hurt your SERP placing. That&#x27;s okay, too.<p>But if AdWords worked such that paying for AdWords actively hurt your SERP positioning, I think people would have the same kind of problem with it that they do with this.",1392127128

Especially considering so many terminal illnesses can in fact be cured with (very expensive) treatments.<p>By definition, they aren&#x27;t terminal illness then. In any case, in the US (or many other countries), those treatments are unavailable or will literally make someone homeless (and preclude them ever getting insurance again). There&#x27;s also the question of if it&#x27;s worth it - will the end result provide proper quality of life or not.<p>Breaking a leg is a specious analogy as it is neither terminal nor permanent; but if something worse did happen and it would permanently affect my quality of life, yes, I&#x27;d still feel the same.",1392127015

I just love GUIs, they make interfaces so intuitive and simple compared to plain text menus.<p>The weird part of the article is for decades I&#x27;ve been stuck doing the laundry because its a &quot;programming job&quot; which is more my lifestyle than my wife, so I&#x27;m way more comfortable doing it than her.  The washing machine is already a &quot;mans washing machine&quot;.  The &quot;womans washing machine&quot; would have one button labeled &quot;nag husband&quot; to notify me, and a separate set of controls for me to actually use when I arrive.  I have a gut feeling that HN readers are going to get stuck programming the washing machine regardless of their sex unless their S.O. is the superior programmer in the family.  Its the same way with cooking, its a simple procedural program with a couple subroutines and some library routines, whats so complicated about cooking other than the real time OS aspects of trying to get a whole meal to completion more or less simultaneously?<p>Personally I think a data flow diagram UI would be a heck of a lot simpler and easier to use.  Its the kids stuff so its filthy so soak and scrub the hell out of it in high temp water.  Its my biz casual work clothes so press &quot;permanent press&quot; button and walk away.  Its blankets and sheets so slow spin because its going to be out of balance no matter the supposed auto-balancer.  This is intuitive with a data flow diagram or procedural programming but pretty mystifying with an object oriented GUI where everything is marketing trademark or incomprehensible icons.<p>The other comedy is its a commentary on lifestyle where its important to spend hours a month studying fashion and hours standing in stores to make a selection but once you do the only reason for existence, that being consuming, once its bought then spending 30 seconds and no money learning how to keep it clean is just waaaaay tooooo muuuch, so just walk around like pigpen or wearing pastel colored former-whites or whatever other epic fails.",1392126420

It is still a great rallying signal though, and its effects have already gone beyond the single day, and for every person too lazy to change their avatar back, they will carry on for a good while longer in some way.<p>However, the motivation for the average person to even think about engaging such an overwhelming and invisible force as mass surveillance is very close to zero. For those who are willing, involvement seems to be passive (donating to a more capable organization, hitting a like button, resharing links), bursty (waiting for organized events to rally around), or demoralizing (low visibility of opponent, lack of support from uninterested peers or locals, extremely slow and indirect feedback loop for any action).<p>For these reasons, I hope that a campaign modeled as a constantly running open source game engine emerges, because that is actually just the bare minimum required for victory - to at least continue playing the game as long as your opponent is playing, no matter whether you are winning or losing at the moment.<p>A game model will at least make undeniably clear that there exists a thing worth playing for (your personal information perhaps), that there are actual opponents who can and will take this thing from you, and the visibility and mechanics needed for you to take action to protect that thing.",1392124827

If the worst happens (typo, whatever) you&#x27;re either not going to boot or have a somewhat rough time of it.

Then boot.  Did it work?  Cool, think about making it permanent.  If it crash down in flames?  Well, no problem, that edit wasn&#x27;t permanent, just reboot and its all good.  When/if you make it permanent, if you make a typo, you can edit to boot and fix it using the same &quot;hit E to edit&quot; technique you just used to test, so no fear.<p>I made the change permanent on Jan 6th on my work desktop and its been pretty boring indeed since then.

As far as I could find as of a month ago there was no problem having both sysvinit and systemd installed simultaneously and select at boot time.  Someone with more time on hands/motivation could make an entirely new grub stanza to simply select from the grub menu if you want sysvinit or systemd.<p>Its a good article other than that minor &quot;test before making permanent&quot; thing.",1392123780

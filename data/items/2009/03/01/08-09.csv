They'd be better off just buying smaller interesting companies to aquire interesting technologies rather than trying to implement it themselves.

It's useless blocking a large amount of adverts.<p>If it comes installed, adverts will all just change and it'll be rendered useless.<p>You can't draw parallels with TiVo. Video adverts prevent you getting to see the content you want. You have to wait.\nInternet advertising does not do this. It's just additional information.",1235897271

The amount of time you'll spend setting it up, testing it, maintaining it, is time wasted on other important aspects of your business/application.

If filenames don't matter, or if you have a gateway that's handling the mogile lookup and filename translation, it's a great solution.<p>If you already have a reliable central filestore, varnish or squid might accomplish faster distribution without having to replicate all your files.<p>Otherwise, I'm curious to see everyone's suggestions.

And, as I already pointed out in comments to the post:<p>Before choosing Squid 3.0 I've discussed this with percona guys (which I really trust since I worked there quite a while) and they shared with my some really weird stories from their experience (on boardreader.com) with Varnish (constant memory leaks, crashes, etc). So, I decided to go with Squid and pretty happy about the result so far.",1224989926

343998,comment,343594,343709,0,0,jimbokun,,,"You are making statements without data, and I do not share your intuitions.<p>I think you underestimate the leap that doing the kinds of abstraction needed for doing any kind of programming at all, and the very small differences between programming languages.  There are probably many (most?) people to whom both ""if object is not null:"" and ""(if foo 1 2)"" will never be comprehensible.  But I think the number of people who can understand the first but not the second or vice versa is negligible.  And I think you can make just as good a case that Lisp is easier for the beginner to understand.  We tend to think that non-Lisp languages are easier to understand because they are superficially similar to one another.  But to the beginner they are just a jumble of symbols arranged in strange ways.  The simplicity and consistency of Lisp forms may very well be more quickly comprehended by a mind undamaged by Java or C or any of those similar languages.",1224989716

Since you include the jquery in your head tag (which is necessary), the whole page did not show for 40 s.  Not sure why the js took that long.  Maybe the server load increased between the time the page load the HTML and the time it loaded the js- doesn't seem likely though.",1224989559

One is allowed to found and work for a company in the US while one is on it. I think they last 3 years.<p>Generally, PhD level people can obtain it, though it is a pain to do so. I have heard of people straining to get 10 eminent people to write supporting letters for one's visa petition. A good link is here:<p><a href=""http://www.hooyou.com/o-1/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hooyou.com/o-1/faq.html</a><p>There's a fairly extensive list of what may be accepted as supporting documentation there. I think these are the criteria the government uses:<p>Receipt of a major, internationally recognized award, such as the Nobel Prize; or at least three of the following forms of documentation:
(1) Documentation of the alien's receipt of nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor;
(2) Documentation of the alien's membership in associations in the field for which classification is sought, which require outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields;
(3) Published material in professional or major trade publications or major media about the alien, relating to the alien's work in the field for which classification is sought, which shall include the title, date, and author of such published material, and any necessary translation;
(4) Evidence of the alien's participation on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied field of specialization to that for which classification is sought;
(5) Evidence of the alien's original scientific, scholarly, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field;
(6) Evidence of the alien's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional journals, or other major media;
(7) Evidence that the alien has been employed in a critical or essential capacity for organizations and establishments that have a distinguished reputation;
(8) Evidence that the alien has either commanded a high salary or will command a high salary or other remuneration for services, evidenced by contracts or other reliable evidence.",1224989360

343980,comment,343594,343782,0,0,PieSquared,,,"A friend of mine was being taught Java in an introductory programming course (although he already knew some BASIC). He was having a lot of trouble, so I introduced him to Lisp... After touring through some of the more basic features (no macro-writing or call/cc), he responded with, ""Whoa... This is so much simpler than Java, it makes so much more sense.""<p>My take on that was that the only reason people find Java easier is because it's more similar to other curly-brace languages, the ones they already know. If you take a newcomer to programming, Lisp just <i>may</i> actually be <i>simpler</i>. So the  unwashed masses still have some hope.",1224987953

343971,comment,342262,343661,0,0,netcan,,,"I agree with you to an extent.  Seth tends to irritate me a little personally. But he is good at getting his ideas out there. Not just his name, his ideas & concepts. The tool he uses to achieve this is what you call buzzwords, which by definition are words that resonate to an extent & make it into people's vocabulary & thought processes.<p>'Meme' vs 'ideavirus' will suffice as an example. 'Meme' will not be used by the same people to have the same thoughts as 'ideavirus'. I hope we can agree on that (the discussion would be cumbersome). It flat wouldn't. The words have different connotations & usages even if they can be defined exactly the same way in a dictionary. Just like your usage of 'buzzword' has a different connotation to 'vogue word' & 'technical term' has a different connotation to 'jargon'. Ergo, it is a powerful tool for communication.<p>Inserting words into people's vocabulary changes the way they think. It is useful even if there is already an existing word with the same formalised meaning.<p>As I said I agree with you to an extent. There is nothing worse then watching marketing attempts to create a lexicon flop. It is something that can become polluted very quickly.",1224987090

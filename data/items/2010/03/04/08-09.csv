In SE Asia it's a WinXP world, almost everyone runs pirated copies so there's not much interest in FOSS or knowledge of Linux, OS X, or any alternate OS.<p>The first thing she said upon logging in to the guest acct was, ""Linux is FUGLY!"", but I think she's started liking the fact that it boots quickly and can do everything she needs with OpenOffice, evince, Skype, &c. While she is not particularly committed to FOSS, after this trip away from home without Win she has come to see the light. To ease the transition I installed Chrome, added all her contacts to Pidgin/Jabber (all her old friends from the Philippines use Yahoo! products) and I don't think she misses WinXPProSP3 at all.",1267693089

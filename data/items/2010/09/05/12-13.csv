Some such differences have stalled political negotiations and such historically.<p>FWIW:  I speak conversational German but can't really follow the News in German and can't really read or write it.  I read and write French a little but never developed an ear for it so I have enormous difficulty following spoken French and struggle enormously to put together a spoken sentence.  I think there are substantial differences between written and spoken, formal and informal for any language.",1283691495

There are a few people who have tried some things and given me positive feedback.  It is one reason I haven't removed the site. In recent months, I post a lot less to health lists than I used to.  Part of that is circumstantial (I worked overtime regularly for several months and my previous computer died, leaving me without a computer for three months).  But part of it is that fighting with people is not turning out to be a good means to help them (and isn't a great experience for me either, though I can put up with quite a lot of crap if it is at least accomplishing something, but it's not).  They are very ill.  It is a highly charged subject.  Most of the time, members of the community are incapable of behaving rationally (been there, done that, got the t-shirt).  They are desperate for a solution and some folks in the community will raise tens of thousands of dollars for the CF Foundation while at the same time making ugly accusations about my motives because there are a few ads on my website.<p>When my youngest son was about 15 months old and newly walking, there was a place on our street where the sidewalk had a one inch high curb.  He was a clumsy kid and would get down on hands and knees and crawl over that curb.  If I am going to effectively reach more than a handful of people, I have to go around and remove all barriers, no matter how small.  These are people for whom small things can be quite deadly.  Asking them to take risks with their health on some unproven theory is insane.  Bill Gates has said something like ""Your unhappiest customers are your best source of learning"".  I have concluded that the folks who would like to lynch me are basically saying that I am a serious threat to their welfare and that sharing the idea that one <i>can</i> get well without sharing enough information for others to effectively and <i>safely</i> replicate the process is doing more harm than good.  If I want to do something other than piss and moan about how no one is ever nice to me, I have to take that message seriously and DO something more effective.<p>Thank you for the feedback and the chance to think through this some more.",1283689541

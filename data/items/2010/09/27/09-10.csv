You can't expect it to be content driven before people understand what it is or why they should be adding content. Also, how and where were you marketing it? Web apps aren't like the game from the the movie ""Field of Dreams"". If you build it, people only come if they know that their work will not be wasted.

This hardly seems like a major issue to me, according to wikipedia the Predator drone is equipped with hellfire munition, which have their own laser guided trajectory. Depending on the type the hellfire munition has approximately 8000ft range, so something tells me the drone itself doesn't guide the hellfire to the ground.<p>But 13m? I'm no munitions/combat expert, but I assume 13m discrepancy, even if it does apply to the hellfire itself, won't make much of a difference. Something is going to get blown up anyway, even if it is off by 13meters the target will essentially no longer be there.",1285580173

That said, I find it hard to read an article on ""intellectual hipsterism"" that claims the average IQ of their readers is 145.  The page the author links to in support of that claim mentions two giant caveats: First, IQ is a notoriously difficult to measure metric of questionable validity, and second, <i>the scores are self-reported</i>.  The reported values range from 120-180.  Essentially, the survey suggests that the top half of their readership is in the top 1% of the national population.  Even their bottom half is in the top 10%, by their statistics.  This suggests a fatal flaw in the survey, and to mention the resulting statistic in such an offhand manner and with no warning to the reader of the problems with it suggests at best laziness, and at worst intellectual dishonesty on the part of the author.  I find it hard, therefore, to take their argument at face value.  That's not to say it's invalid, merely that the author's conduct does not support its validity.",1285579581

That said, you should also cut chocolate, alcohol, carbonated or acidic beverages and anything with caffeine in it. Reduce your diet to fruit and vegetables for a few days and drink mostly water (room temperature). Then experiment by adding in other foods over time.<p>You may already have done this. But if you haven't you need to. Because if something in your diet is exacerbating your digestive problems, you will start feeling better faster by cutting all suspect foods than by randomly eliminating them one-by-one. Also, you may find your system better able to handle certain foods when it isn't under stress from digesting others. Some things that cause problems for you when you're sick might be perfectly OK in moderation when you're feeling healthy.<p>As far as business goes, I run my own startup (bootstrapped) and it is really hard and stressful. I'd suggest keeping your job with health insurance and trying to fix your lifestyle/diet before taking on any extra stress.

And I would prefer if you don't make these assumptions about me.<p>All I am saying is that signaling does not have to be conscious or self-aware in the sense of ""Oh, I have to say this and that to rise to the top of the hipster hierarchy"". It might just be the hipster enjoys dressing contrary to the mainstream just as the contrarian enjoys arguing contrary to the mainstream opinion. Hence my analogy: I enjoy sex. It's a heuristic shaped by my genes that would usually serve the purpose of reproduction. People enjoy signaling in the form of buying nice cars of putting on make-up: it's heuristic shaped by our genes that on average (not every signal leads to a better outcome) increases the chance of reproduction. It is not the you actively think ""Okay: if I buy a car it might increase my social standing and ultimately increase the chance of girls liking me more."". You just enjoy the stuff. Just as you ""just enjoy sex"" or the bower bird has an innate desire to build colorful homes.<p>EDIT for clarity.",1285579242

Wondering if you could help me, or at least have a discussion on templating systems that are design-focused.  We are creating a 'sitebuilder' app for a niche and we've created our first app, which has one template.  We have decided to allow people to create designs for the system, but this will mean having a templating language.  We've looked at others - from Wordpress through to Shopify - and most seem to use one that they have home grown.  I am wondering what peoples experiences are?<p>1) Would you create your own template system as Shopify has done? (http://wiki.shopify.com/Theme_from_scratch). I see the downside of this that every designer will need to use your specific 'language' to create themes/designs<p>2) Are there any templating languages out there that you would use or recommend. I've looked at language-specific ones, but most of them are focused on coders and not designers. At the moment we have most of the app coded in PHP, but we are moving slowly towards Python, so it would be great to have a templating system that we can use for both<p>I'd be really interested in what people have to say about this and if they use any solution or what their opinions are<p>Thanks in advance<p>John",1285579125

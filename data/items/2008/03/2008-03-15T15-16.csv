There was a single background thread which handled (surprise!) comms.<p>Both the Palm and the Newton also had a sophisticated notification frameworks to deal with asynchonous messages.<p>It isn't as convenient, but it can be done.  Heck, I've done it!  And it retains some control by the platform, which is the point.<p>And while I love the premise of Android, I think that developing for 10 000 000 iPhones rather than 0 gPhones may be a prudent business move.",1205596481

137572,comment,137528,137528,0,0,iamwil,,,"I was confused at first, as it seemed like he was pulling magic numbers out of the air, but I worked out most of it, and thought others would be interested.  And also to see if I mis-understood anything.<p>I get that we start off with $100 mil with the ""2 and 20"".  2% annually for funds under management, and a 20 percent incentive fee for returns that exceed the 4% benchmark.<p>And I think here, he uses part of the $100 mil to sell $0.10 options, which if you sell 110 mil  $0.10 options, you make $11 mil.  So  far, you have $111 mil, as long as the event doesn't happen.<p>So he uses $110mil of the $111mil to put into an investment guaranteed to give him 4% in one year and he uses the remaining $1 mil to spend on geeks.<p>So after one year, he'd have $110 mil * 0.04 = $4.4 mil from interest.  So far, all together he has $110 mil + $4.4 mil = $114.4 mil, and he spent $1 mil on geeks.  If you count just money in fund, and not money spent, it's $115.4 mil ($114.4mil + $1mil)<p>So all together, the return is $115.4 mil (total)  - $100 mil (original money), which gives us the $15.4 mil, of which $1 mil is already spent on geeks.<p>The $2 mil comes from the ""2 and 20"" mentioned before, which he gets 2% of the original $100 mil for management fees.  Here, I'm guessing it's the remaining amount that exceeds the benchmark of 4% of $100 mil.  So $15.4mil - (4% * $100 mil) = $11.4 mil.  And he gets 20% of $11.4 mil = $2.28 mil.  So in total, he earned $2mil + $2.28 mil, of which he spent $1 mil on geeks so $2mil + $2.28mil - $1mil ~= $3mil<p>I can see why he says the fund manager's not doing anything.  The extra $15.4 mil return that's paying the fund manager, geeks, and investors mostly comes from betting on sure thing for options to get $11 mil of the $15.4mil and a guaranteed $4.4 mil from treasure bills, mostly on the strength of having the $100 mil in the first place.<p>""Making $110 from $100 is hard work.  Making $110mil from $110 mil is inevitable""",1205596342

You can have a brilliant idea and watch it die on poor implementation and marketing, and a crumby one and make [m|b]illions from it. What's kind of fun and surprising about the Web 2.0 phenomenon is watching apparently weak ideas taking on a life of their own and becoming something interesting and useful.<p>Anyway, regardless of the merit of an idea in itself, can we all agree it's getting a bit tedious when people come to YC news and say ""I've got a fabulous idea but no programming skills and I'd like to know where to take it. BTW, I won't tell you what it is""? I'd characterise that as attention seeking or border-line trolling.",1205596342

137569,comment,137358,137539,0,0,ambition,,,"That's a good point. I thought about it some more, I think we would end up with trusted idea 'editors'. Folks with no reputation would be forced to go to these high-reputation editors to resell ideas. These editors would gain reputation for their excellent judgement of ideas which they publish and sell.<p>I think you're right though, good ideas don't come from people with a few consistently good ideas, they come from people with thousands of ideas and the right filters in place.",1205596198

The major reasons to be a corporation are:<p>* You have assets that you want to shield from liability when your customers sue you -- you'd rather have them sue the corporation instead. But, no customers yet = no problem yet. Assuming that your new idea doesn't involve radioactivity or anything.<p>* You want to give away shares in your new business to angel investors, VCs, or partners. No investors = no problem.<p>In any case, if you really think you want to form a corp you should talk to an accountant, and possibly a lawyer, about the details.",1205596079
137567,comment,137486,137486,0,0,mironathetin,,,"I have one more idea to put in.<p>As a developer I always liked to have a slow machine. That makes sure you optimize your software and the user experience will be great.<p>This also means that you can live with the cheaper consumer lines. While my first mac was a iBook (blueberry), I bought powerbooks ever since. But I was never as happy with the powerbooks as I was with the iBook (except the Pismo perhaps - that was indeed the greatest machine ever). Currently I use a Titanium Powerbook with 1 GHz.<p>My next purchase will be a Macbook, no doubt. Battery life is critical and also durability and finally weight. If you are on a budget, the macbooks also give you more security: if one breaks down, you can buy a second one (apples repair times are longer thana busy deveolper can afford to wait). Two macbooks are cheaper than one pro.",1205596039

Though if i carried 12 extra batteries, they might say something.<p>The 5400rpm vs 7200rpm makes a difference.  Not as much as working in the ram instead of swapping, but there is a difference in performance.  Whether you need it or not is another story.  Though maxing your ram out is always a good thing to do regardless.<p>There isn't much of a difference from 2.4 to 2.5 or 2.6GHz, though there is a huge one from 2.1GHz (Base Macbook) to 2.6GHz (BTO Macbook Pro).  That makes a huge difference.  Even 'only' 10% more is huge when it comes down to rendering or compiling things. The less time you have to sit around waiting for it to render/load/compile, the more time you can spend doing work or the quicker you can get your work done.",1205595431

I'm not talking about book-long specifications, but for sure you should have some requirements on unit functionality and code quality. And the unit's value is not about predicting the future but derives from your sales plan. This is about a startup already in a situation when it hires employees, so they usually have some historic data on the market and their own performance to base their guesses on.",1205593605

8850193,comment,8847063,8848550,0,0,iuguy,,,"Chase HQ was a great game on the ZX Spectrum. I got an original 48k release copy when it came out so that I could crack the loader for school and drop pokes in. After seeing your comment I thought I&#x27;d have a look in an emulator and see how long it&#x27;d take me to walk through the loader with modern tools.<p>The original release uses Paul Owen&#x27;s protection system, which is really just a headerless loader and some playing around with system variables. If you want a bit of lunchtime fun, go and get an emulator with a debugger, get the original from WoS[1] and switch off all the tape loader acceleration. Type LOAD &quot;&quot; (Usually J, alt-p, alt-p on a modern keyboard) and press return, then make sure you&#x27;re playing the tape.<p>If you load it you&#x27;ll get an initial basic loader, then a screeching red and black striped loader which sets up the initial load.<p>The loader uses the IX and DE registers to specify where to load the next block of data and how much data to load respectively. The initial bit of data loads in at 0x8200 and is 0x0200 long.<p>If you break in your debugger after that initial high pitched red and black bit you should be able to see that the IX register will point to 0x4000 and DE will point to 0x1800, 0x4000 is the start of screen memory, which is 6144 bytes (or 0x1800) long.<p>After the screen loads you&#x27;ll see the next block (at 0x5B00, 0x4A80 long) - this overwrites the system variables and lower parts of memory. As this is in contended memory it runs more slowly than the rest, this should be used to store the main system code that makes sure everything&#x27;s ticking along with some of the code to handle bits between the levels and the text used in the game. It&#x27;s been nearly 25 years since I&#x27;ve hacked ZX spectrum games on a regular basis so I could be wrong.<p>The following block loads into 0xC000 (IX) and is 0x3F00 (DE) bytes long, which if memory serves is the main in-game code and some game assets but again it&#x27;s been a long time and I might be wrong. I&#x27;d expect music to be up here too and any time sensitive code such as the code handling the countdown timer for the game.<p>After this a small two byte header is loaded into 0x5BD5 which is used to load a small header. Another block overwrites system variables again at 0x5C00 and some of the earlier loaded game material then jumps to the main game code where it loops around FEFE jumping to the music player and keypress check starting at EF19.<p>If once you&#x27;re in the game you want to have a fiddle, go to the redefine keys option and redefine the keys to be &quot;SHOCKED&quot; then press enter for the last key to enter test mode for the game. The 48k version is a multiload game which means each level is loaded from tape. I think the 128k version is similar but with music, but I never looked at the 128k version.<p>I would&#x27;ve been able to do a bit more with something like ZX32 (which is what I used to fiddle with) but I&#x27;m on a Mac and half the fuse debugging stuff doesn&#x27;t work. Still, it&#x27;s amazing what you can do with emulators these days compared to my multiface one. I would&#x27;ve killed for tools like this!",1420635150

What tools do we turn towards ?<p>The thing is for example in ML the standard solution is to use gradient decent, but what I learnt is depends highly on the type of equations you are dealing with. The first tool should never be a hammer. We used stochastic gradient decent on linear machine tasks ! Now after learning optimization theory it seems like madness.

One page described the fate of a sailor playing with a multimeter in an unauthorized manner. He was curious about the resistance level of the human body. He had a Simpson 260 multimeter, a small unit powered by a 9-volt battery. That may not seem powerful enough to be dangerous… but it can be deadly in the wrong hands.<p>> The sailor took a probe in each hand to measure his bodily resistance from thumb to thumb. But the probes had sharp tips, and in his excitement he pressed his thumbs hard enough against the probes to break the skin. Once the salty conducting fluid known as blood was available, the current from the multimeter travelled right across the sailor&#x27;s heart, disrupting the electrical regulation of his heartbeat. He died before he could record his Ohms.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the volts that jolt but the mills that kill&quot; - voltage gives you the electric shock feeling but current across the heart will kill you.",1420632982

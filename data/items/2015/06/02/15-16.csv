9646729,comment,9643401,9646388,0,0,crdb,,,"Well put it this way: you&#x27;re 65, you&#x27;ve led a few companies but now sit on 10-15 corporate boards of multi-billion dollar companies in your spare time, flying around the world for the meetings, there&#x27;s another 10 people like you in the room, you&#x27;re meeting the consultants and management after a long lunch (possibly boozy), you have a hunch about why the company is losing sales, but then the consultants put forward this extraordinarily well documented case of why there&#x27;s 6 other explanations which combined have led to the decline in sales. So you doubt yourself, a little bit. There ARE after all 400 slides in the deck. And all these numbers, and the immense effort the consultants put in, and the way they have convincing answers for everything. At the time, it looked like a cool bet and could have paid off well if it had worked out. Earnings were through the roof for over a year too, so it did pad the treasury.<p>Can&#x27;t go against fate, right? Oh well, there&#x27;s still 14 board seats left. And the acquisition is better than nothing, looks like a good price. Even if your hunch is right, what&#x27;s the point of punishing a team that&#x27;s halfway out of the door anyway for a set of bad decisions that can&#x27;t be reversed? Once you reach that conclusion, you switch off, let the German drone on in his thick accent, and think about what you&#x27;ll get your granddaughter for her 5th birthday next week in Milwaukee - what is a good German souvenir that a 5 year old would enjoy? You&#x27;re lost on the meeting from now on.<p>As for bad management, well, is it their fault? Was it part of their &quot;schooling&quot;? (There&#x27;s a saying in trading that losses are &quot;tuition fees&quot;) Were there extenuating circumstances? I can name (but won&#x27;t, because I&#x27;m a nobody and you never know when you might need connections) a series of well known political and business figures in California, for example, who have provably run large companies to the ground (as far as my humble, not-very-profitable, not-that-learned opinion is concerned) and now enjoy exceptional careers - it&#x27;s amazing how far being born in the right place and with the right network can carry you.<p>Since one is allowed to criticize one&#x27;s own politicians, look at Sarkozy, who was voted out and replaced by what is probably the least attractive, least popular, least &quot;presidential&quot; candidate the left ever put up, as a protest vote more than anything, who somehow still clings to the leadership and has even managed to make himself favorite for 2017 on the right (he even had the balls to rename his party after the US Republicans). No-one, in his own party or its membership, has the balls to pull the trigger. People don&#x27;t rock the boat. They make excuses, and things just decay slowly. Accountability is hard work and without help, usually leads to the loudmouth getting shot down.<p>I remember someone once saying that one misgiving of youth is to think you have to be exceptional when really, just doing the job properly is often enough to make you exceptional compared to your peers. I do think that business performance is naturally high-dimensional with very sparse data (high-p, low-n, with non-linear behaviour) which makes it very difficult to understand, more than people expect. For example, a LOT of companies are just levered beta - they go up faster than the market, and go down faster than the market - which makes whoever is in charge look like a genius during any extended boom, and remain a genius if he retires before the bust (putting the blame on the new guy, naturally; I&#x27;m not at all thinking about a certain company with a blue logo and two initials, or a certain &quot;American&quot; insurance company with three). Experienced business people are at least instinctively aware of this and avoid making too harsh judgement calls based on simplistic evidence.<p>Of course all I&#x27;ve said applies to my own conclusions. Maybe my team members and I were overworked and slightly paranoid or annoyed and saw what we wanted to see. But I&#x27;d say the probability on that one is pretty high on the side of &quot;management screw up&quot;.",1433260773

9646670,comment,9645729,9645729,0,0,andrewstuart2,,,"I&#x27;m all for bending your text editor to your will, but a few of these tips gloss over the core of vim: the shortcut <i>language</i> it offers and the composability of its parts of speech [1].<p>For example, remapping the paste key to <i>paste</i> + <i>move to end</i> is cool, but `ppppp` to paste 5 times circumvents vim&#x27;s killer repetition. Want to paste 100 copies? (hopefully you do this rarely).  Just type `100p` and you&#x27;re done. I won&#x27;t bother typing out the obvious sequence of repeated `p` presses, but you get the drift.<p>Also, remapping v to progressively select larger surrounding text objects will keep you from learning that you can perform any action on the 3rd parent curly braces by following the action with the text object `3a{` or `3a}`. Select it: `v3a{`, delete it: `d3a{`, comment it out `gc3a{` ([2]), whatever. If there&#x27;s an action in vim you can perform it on a text object which can usually start with some count.<p>I really do mean language, too.  When I&#x27;m using vim, I feel a lot more like I&#x27;m communicating with my computer than trying to figure out how to do what I want to do.<p>The actions are there: delete, change, select. The direct objects are there: braces, this line, line number N, end of this word, the next character C, this paragraph. The prepositions are there: inside, outside, up to (inclusive, exclusive).<p>Heck, the sensible defaults feel a whole lot like the &quot;understood&quot; words that you can leave out of sentences. Instead of &quot;navigate to line 30&quot;, you can just use the shortcut for &quot;line 30&quot; (30G) and be done.<p>One of my favorite things about vim is the number of times I&#x27;ve literally been <i>surprised</i> that vim didn&#x27;t read my mind and go where I was looking. Once you&#x27;re familiar with the different pieces, it&#x27;s so good that you might expect it to read your mind.<p></almost-blog-post><p>[1] <a href=""http://ferd.ca/vim-and-composability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ferd.ca/vim-and-composability.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary</a>",1433260278

They entered them willingly with the U.S. because they recognize the advantages of doing business with the U.S.<p>The U.S. government is among the least corrupt and most transparent in the world. Foreign nations and investors trust that they will be treated predictably and fairly by the U.S. government. The same cannot be said for China.<p>The U.S. economy is incredible innovative, which drives growth in a trading relationship. China today is rich because they have been the manufacturer, not originator, of major innovations. They can (and IMO will) develop a similar level of innovation themselves, but they have a long way to go because of the next point.<p>The single biggest long-term strategic advantage of the U.S. is our protections for citizen rights like expression, assembly, lobbying, etc. This is why we have one of the most innovative economies in the world. People are free to say what they think, invent new ideas and products, and influence the government to support them.<p>The U.S. is seen as less militarily and territorially agressive than China. No nation in the Pacific Rim today worries that the U.S. will invade them or seize islands, with the possible exception of always-paranoid North Korea. Many nations have that worry about China.<p>People like to say that China is playing chess and the U.S. is playing checkers. They said the same thing about the USSR, about Japan, about Putin, etc. The thing about long-term plans is that work great until they don&#x27;t--then new thinking is required. The U.S. is among the best in the world at surfacing and applying new thinking.<p>Important Edit:<p>The TPP is a multilateral agreement, so it&#x27;s not just about the U.S. vs China. The U.S. is by far the largest economy in the agreement, and I live there so that is what I focused on above.

As a woman it might even happen that your husbands parents have more power over your life than your own parents. So there is often no chance to divorce. In fact many Chinese women wouldn&#x27;t even attempt that, because of fear to lose their job, any chance to remarry, losing both party&#x27;s parents&#x27; favour. The husband does not have to accept any punishment for having a lover on the side, not doing their part at home, or for not taking care of the child(ren).<p>A typical situation in China is the wife fighting the younger girlfriend of the husband, both fighting to gain the man&#x27;s favour. This only happens out of fear, not out of respect for oneself.<p>So to answer your question: She&#x27;s an exception for actually divorcing her husband, but she&#x27;s not an exception for getting punished for the divorce more than the husband who is actually the one  who caused the divorce.",1433260131

For the casual user it was very convincing stuff: &quot;Oh wow, maybe @steiner1776 is right and that report was full of lies, and I just didn&#x27;t know better - thank goodness I have someone who is willing to stand up for truth.&quot;<p>Most people don&#x27;t have time to research, and just follow public opinion, even if the public opinion is created by a bunch of trolls. It&#x27;s especially easy to fall for the trolls when they tell you that &quot;the man&quot; has been lying to you all along (and in most cases &quot;the man&quot; means the United States). (To be clear: The United States does some messed up stuff and is far, far from without fault.)<p>There were a few days when they would seemingly download photos from any tragedy that had ever happened, and just add a generic line - something like &quot;Stop killing Donbass people,&quot; insinuating that these deaths were caused by the Ukrainian army (and by extension, somehow, the United States). The photos were from Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Israel - wherever. I&#x27;m sure they were just being pulled from some file somewhere with a generic message attached. But that stuff _exploded_. Hundreds of thousands of retweets per day, driving public opinion, based on complete and utter bullshit.<p>So there are some Russian trolls; this isn&#x27;t the end of the world, right? The problem is that for many of the people on Twitter these were <i>real people</i> expressing <i>legitimate concern</i>. Some of their blatantly false tweets (they were easily discoverable to be such with a reverse image search) went legitimately viral (not just spun into their other accounts for retweets). Hundreds of thousands of impressions per tweet from people who aren&#x27;t going to run a reverse image search, and get their news from Twitter.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, but this is extremely dangerous for society. It&#x27;s easy to pass them off as &quot;trolls,&quot; but trolls change the way that people act and believe, even when they&#x27;re only sharing false information.<p>We started Grasswire in part as a response to that. The fact-check feature on Grasswire isn&#x27;t used as frequently now, but at the time about 50% of the stuff that went viral was completely and verifiably false - look at the history of the Grasswire Fact-Check account (@grasswirefacts) for examples of that.

So you don&#x27;t have to put up a previous house to get a new house.  Essentially, you find a house you like.  Let&#x27;s say it costs $100,000 USD.  You go to a bank and tell them you want a loan for this amount with which to purchase the house.  This is where it gets a little muddy - depending on the loan type, some want 3% down, some 10% down, etc etc.  My most recent loan was 0% down, but a higher interest rate.  The reason that lenders are willing to do this is two-fold.  Firstly, if you don&#x27;t pay, they will take the house back.  So they generally make sure the house is worth equal to or more than the loan amount - hence why many want a down payment - so that the loan amount is less than the purchase price, in case they have to take it back and resell it.  Secondly, they stand to make much interest over time.  You can run the numbers, but that $100,000 house you&#x27;ll end up paying 50-60,000 or more in interest over the course of the loan.

We found a two-bedroom apartment (a house split into 3 units) that was going for $425/month plus utilities. Because we split, I had to pay about $300/month to keep a roof over my head. I think I was making $8/hr, so the first week of the month mostly covered my living expenses (not including taxes and the like of course). Very different than the 78 hours that shows for PA.<p>Anecdotal, I know, but the point being that if you&#x27;re willing to make tradeoffs, you can find a way to live.

After my spouse and I got a house, we rented out our spare bedroom for a time to help pay down school loans and provide an affordable space for friends.

This meant that the massive profits generated by Minecraft still went straight into their pockets, even though Markus himself hadn’t done any actual work on Minecraft for over two years now. ... Many no longer regarded Markus, Carl, and Jakob as their equals, as part of the team, but simply as management. Mojang had long since ceased to be anything but a workplace.&quot;</i><p>Sounds like if you were a working stiff at Mojang, your options were simply &quot;find a new job&quot; or &quot;enjoy a $300,000 bonus after 6 months of continued employment&quot;.  Compared to what had been happening, this sounds like an <i>improvement</i>.<p>I can&#x27;t blame Mojang&#x27;s founders for selling the company; hell, I&#x27;d do the same when offered that much money.  Markus (Notch) can spend the rest of his life quietly making games mostly to amuse himself.  That sounds like a dream.  But when I read something like this:<p><i>&quot;When Microsoft sent a delegation for its first official visit to Mojang in Stockholm, Markus wasn’t around. Few if any of his employees knew for sure, but it was rumored that he’d just returned from a few days in Vegas with Jakob. Either way, he was either too tired or too uninterested to show up in person. The task of representing Mojang to its new owners fell on Carl.&quot;</i><p>and:<p><i>&quot;The day before, Markus had put in his last day at work. Several others were in the office as he stood up to leave. He hesitated, not sure how to say goodbye. So he decided not to.&quot;</i><p>...I can&#x27;t help but think, &quot;geez, what an ass.&quot;  You&#x27;ve got your big payday, but you can&#x27;t even be bothered to see the thing through or say goodbye to some of the people who helped <i>make</i> your big payday happen?<p>This is only one side of the story, of course, and as rilita notes elsewhere in this thread this is largely a promotion for a book.  After reading this and having watched Minecraft&#x27;s lack of progress over the last year (compared to its previous 2), I think that perhaps the acquisition by Microsoft may be the best thing that happened to the game.",1433257672

I can tell you why it didn&#x27;t happen in unions I&#x27;m familiar with: The union representatives who negotiate on behalf of the employees and the people who can score a >$200k salary are mutually exclusive groups. In fact, they negotiators are usually those who wouldn&#x27;t score more than the prevailing average in an industry.<p>Why are union members usually people with low salaries? Simple. Only the least skilled are desperate enough to form unions. They <i>have</i> to do it in a sense. Software engineers are complacent with their super high salaries, not knowing that their 120k annual salary is based off work that generates 1 million in monthly revenue. Thanks to the lack of unions, if you try to negotiate a more than fair 500k annual salary the company will shoot you down. Due to another idiot SE in the world who thinks he&#x27;s only worth 120k, you&#x27;re easily replaced without a union backing you up.<p>>At which point, they are happy to sign an agreement for just 5% than the prevailing average - and they do so in the name of the more capable employees as well.<p>There&#x27;s no need to negotiate upper limits on pay. There also should be no need to end individual negotiations. If unions aren&#x27;t currently structured in a way that benefits the employee then the structure of what we consider to be a union should be changed.<p>>Other things that happen is stuff like management requesting the union to agree that &quot;no employee will be paid higher than their manager&quot;. Which union officials always agree to (for various reasons), and which causes your most productive employees - those who are at the top of their fields but not anywhere near the top of the managerial ladder - to abandon ship.<p>why does this need to be agreed too? There&#x27;s no need for this to be agreed to at all. No upper limits to salary. Who wants that? Union members should vote for what they want. Union officials should be held accountable every decision they make. Only lower limits on salary should be negotiated with the union and employer. The actual salary should be a separate negotiation between employee and employer.<p>IF unions aren&#x27;t structured that way then they should be. The government shouldn&#x27;t decide on some arbitrary hierarchy for a union that ends up not benefiting people. People acting together in organized groups generally don&#x27;t want to fuck themselves over with stupid things like upper limits to salary and ending all individual negotiations with the employer.",1433257210

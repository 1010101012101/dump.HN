Match a Mac with a Dell spec-for-spec and the Mac is the same price or a bit cheaper, but the reputation still lingers.",1231246251

421863,comment,421762,421762,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Actually, Linux distros can be the key to a successful non-x86 workstation. RISC workstations more or less failed when Windows did not properly support them - most people didn't care how fast their Alphas or PPCs are if they can't run Office.<p>Now, if you have an ARM netbook that runs OpenOffice, Evolution and Firefox as well as a x86 in a laptop that costs you $200 for a 8-hour battery life, I say you have a major market changer. You are only bound to the x86 as long as you are bound to Microsoft software.<p>I work under Linux most of the time (actually, I use Windows for 9-5 work and Linux for the 5-9 stuff). As long as Emacs, PostgreSQL, Python, Plone and Django are available, I really don't care about what architecture I am using. Performance being adequate, it could be an ARM-based chip, an Intel 432 or a zSeries mainframe and I would not notice the difference until I did a ""uname -a"".<p>I would probably find the zSeries somewhat bulky...",1231246071

Actually, the site visible (for a few days now as of 2009-01-06) is not our final, polished, presentable site.  It is only a working draft that was tossed on in a hurry because of unresolvable technical problems with the old one.  Stay tuned for the _real_ new site, which we expect to be up in a Short While.",1231245803

421859,comment,421833,421833,0,0,swombat,,,"Very interesting, although I'm not quite sure if they established a causal link between these two behaviours. The article isn't detailed enough to know this.<p>It could well be that both behaviours (coming up with excuses - proactively or after-the-fact - and setting yourself up for failure) are driven by something else (e.g. intense distractibility coupled with good creativity and intuition). I'm not saying it is, but that needs to be ruled out before the article's conclusion can be established.",1231245351

On the rest of computers out there (especially laptops), you're forced to pay a Microsoft tax<i>, whether you want to use the operating system or not.<p></i> - excluding maybe Dell's Linux offers and low-end netbooks.",1231245197

Also, they aren't usually complete roadblocks, like the Windows Large File Support problem.",1231244930

With continued improvements to WxWidgets, GTK+ and (to a much lesser extent) Qt and XUL hopefully people will start embracing toolkits designed for true cross-platform development rather than developing for each proprietary API individually and considering other platforms as an afterthought.",1231244724

I find it puzzling that you've got such distaste then, for ""OSX-style UI for retarded Oklahoma children"". If you're so clearly against windows and use OS X and all of the applications it has to offer, aren't you really just saying a bit about yourself here? That or this is purely hypocrisy. For having such hate for ""OSX's idiotic idioms"", I find it pretty surprising that you use the platform at all.<p>At least you could have made your frustrations clear in a less vicious manner, and without making yourself look like such a tool.",1231244256

421848,story,,,2,0,brandnewlow,"Ask HN: When did FastCompany.com ditch their ""web 2.0"" redesign?",,"Several months ago, Fast Company launched a much-heralded redesign of their web site that included user blogs, groups, bookmarking and social networking features.<p>It was built on Drupal 5.  Here's the write-up where the dev team fielded questions and kudos for the work: http://drupal.org/node/221481<p>But just yesterday I loaded it up and it looks like they've tucked away all the social elements into footer links and are now just featuring articles on the front page.  It's a much more conventional presentation.<p>http://www.fastcompany.com/<p>When did this happen?  I can't find anything on the web announcing, reviewing or explaining the change.<p>As a web publisher who's always interested in new ways of presenting content and making it interesting to my audience, I'm really curious about the thinking that went into this.  Was the redesign a big flop?  And if so, shouldn't someone say that?<p>Over on that Drupal page, people are still congratulating the developers on their success as of November.  That strikes me as a bit odd considering the site's done away with much of their handiwork in favor of tried and true ""just list the stories"" approach.<p>For a long while I believe that there could be a way to meld editorial and reader-submitted/rated content on one page.  But the more I've thought about it, worked on it and shown it to people, the less it makes sense to me.<p>I'm now more or less of the mindset that you have to pick one approach and do it well.  Either you bring new information to the web and let everyone else rip off the highlights, editorialize and discuss it with their readers, or you aggregate and build community around other people's work.  I've not seen a single hybrid approach work yet.",1231243581

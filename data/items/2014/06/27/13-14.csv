The app simply lists all the FIFA 2014 matches and which team won the match. The biggest feature of this app is you can actually watch Match highlights. Currently, Match Highlights are available only for first 33 matches, but soon I&#x27;m going to add other matches as well.\nYou can watch high quality videos of all the goals scored by players and matches. It&#x27;s that easy. I tried to make the interface as minimalist as possible so the purpose of the application can be accomplished without any ado.\nYou can download the application from here: http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wesurfweb.world2014goals\nLet me know how&#x27;s the application and what can be done to further improve the application. Also, let me know what other features or things you&#x27;d like to see in this application.\nIf it&#x27;s not available in your country, let me know so I can send you the apk directly. :)",1403877515

But IME it&#x27;s not actually that big an advantage; most logic code belongs to one layer or another. For domain objects (i.e. non-logic code) you can use something like protocol buffers and then you can use the same object definition in both languages.<p>Advantages to me would be much more mature ORM support (e.g. others are talking about how good the migrations are; there are some cool efforts in js e.g. Knex but they&#x27;re still very primitive in comparison to what Django can now do automatically), better templating (certainly arguable, but I find none of the js approaches encourage proper separation of markup and logic), and a much more comfortable language for writing business logic in.

I really like the built in migration framework, which is available from this release (1.7). I think it&#x27;s even easier and cleaner than South! Also the documentation is very clear (as always).<p>There&#x27;s just two commands [0]:<p><pre><code>    makemigrations - to create migrations\n    migrate - to (un)apply migrations\n</code></pre>\nAdding migrations to an existing app is just running the `makemigrations` command for that app [1]:<p><pre><code>    python manage.py makemigrations your_app_label\n</code></pre>\nIt will create a migrations/ folder in the app folder and you&#x27;re good to go. When you change your models and run `makemigrations` again, it will make migrations for the changes you made and you can apply them with the `migrate` command. For migrations that can&#x27;t be detected automatically (like renaming models/fields) you can create an empty migration file (by supplying `--empty` to the `makemigrations` command) and edit the migration file yourself. With the great documentation this is easily done [2].<p>They also support data migrations (migration for the data in your database instead of the scheme of the tables). So I think it replaces pretty much all features of South. BTW, the original creator of South (Andrew Godwin) helped create the migration framework in Django, so no hard feelings ;).<p>[0] <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/#two-commands"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/#two...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/#adding-migrations-to-apps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/#add...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/migration-operations/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/migration-operatio...</a>",1403876475

It&#x27;s a nightmare combination of open-source and closed source, which means fixing any bugs that arise is a total nightmare.<p>One reason they use this is because part of Sencha Command parses your source code and builds a dependency tree which is then used generate a concatenated build, a minimised build, and for Sencha Touch, a diff which is used to deliver delta updates to the browser so the user has less to download when the app updates.<p>This is all great, but I can&#x27;t help but feel if they&#x27;d used a more standard approach - AMD for example - to create their module definitions, they&#x27;d have reduced a whole level of complexity in the framework code and in the surrounding toolset.<p>This is just one corner of the Sencha ecosystem which provides pain points.

It&#x27;s an emergent property, rather than an explicit aim. Thus, my favorite designs have traditionally resembled a microkernel in approach, where the kernel of the app exists only to facilitate disparate services to find and use one another. Interfaces are kept to an absolute minimum, and concerns like UIs or persistence are pushed to the edge of the system, where they should be. This design facilitates division of labor well; more novice developers can make a mess within their subsystem, yet have the damage contained. I usually bolt a pub/sub mechanism on relatively quickly, as this requirement is almost a given with a UI.<p>Dynamic loading is indeed the ultimate modularity. Combined with this microkernel approach, extensions are just as powerful as built-in services. The only problem is you enter a new hell: managing dependencies/versions of the core vs the extensions.

7953786,comment,7951152,7953047,1,0,fafner,,,"I like that KDE avoided the trend to dumb down the tools. E.g., Dolphin has an integrated terminal (F4). Which is extremely handy. I don&#x27;t think that this is something the Gnome folks would ever add to their file manager. That&#x27;s why I prefer KDE.<p>I think KDE&#x27;s biggest problem is that it lacks developers and other resources. And the few resources they have are regularly wasted on rewriting code, adapting KDE for failed tablet projects, and well moving KMail (once the best mail client) to a system (Akonadi) that uses MySQL and some RDF database. Which is like the most useless combination.<p>Why would anyone think that using MySQL to locally store metadata for emails would be a good idea? It constantly eats your battery. And I highly doubt that any individual person receives enough mails per minute to require MySQL to handle the metadata. Which Akonadi couldn&#x27;t even do anyway because the RDF database just absolutely kills scalability. I&#x27;ve tried to delete a few hundred mails and the RDF database went berserk. So why even bother with MySQL then? They&#x27;ve now replaced the RDF database with a simpler replacement they&#x27;ve wrote. So maybe it scales a bit better now. And maybe in a few years they&#x27;ll figure out that the whole MySQL thing was a stupid idea and replace that with a simpler backend.<p>(Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to properly support IMAP IDLE, at least I can&#x27;t tell KMail which folders to watch...)",1403875188

The students you refer to don&#x27;t know how lucky they are to have such principled teachers. Although those teachers may not hold to the consensus view, they are no doubt aware that the history of science has frequently shown the &#x27;consensus view&#x27; to have previously been completely wrong (think hand-washing and germs, for example). Scientist are already reaching a similar conclusion with respect to Darwinian evolution, which is why secular activists, and atheists, have had to campaign vigorously to have their pet theory enforced in the classroom by BY LAW (rather than because the theory has any scientific merit, let alone evidence). If more people invested some time in examining the most up-to-date scientific evidence we would not be having these debates. There is no agency known to mankind whereby a simple cell - let alone an entire universe - can arise out of nothing and without a first cause. NONE. It has never been demonstrated in any laboratory on earth and it never will be. We should confine our teaching to operational (i.e. observable and repeatable) science in the science classroom, and not resort to teaching our children science fictions. Questions about the origin of life should be confined to history, R.E., or philosophy lessons, but even then, BOTH sides of the argument must be explored. We must teach our children HOW to think, not WHAT to think.",1403874504

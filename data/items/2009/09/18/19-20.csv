831057,comment,830734,830781,0,0,tierack,,,"There are a couple of reasons I'm not a huge fan of plans like this.  I have a friend running for state legislature under a similar goal (though only district residents would vote on his votes, not all state residents), and these are the two big points I made to him.<p>1. Most people aren't equipped to think about the kind of issues that come up with legislation.  There are subtle interactions between laws, small economic provisions can have huge market effects, and many sentences end up meaning the exact opposite of what they seem to say.  Ideally (for me, though you may disagree), the person getting voted in is equipped by experience, education, and general smarts.  I want someone voting who is studying law, proposed and current, and making informed decisions.  I don't always get that, but I'm more likely to get that with one person than with many.<p>2. Many Americans are terribly prejudiced.  Pick any poll you have handy showing that more than 50% of Americans believe in something ridiculous and imagine them voting on a law related to that belief.  Historically, perhaps, this vision is dimmer.  It's a cultural issue, not an absolute one, so if we get better as a people, this argument against will become less important.<p>I do like when these kinds of ideas are brought up, however.  Lots of interesting talk happens.",1253303794

831054,comment,830421,831016,0,0,unalone,,,"Funny that you call fashionable people worthless shits while citing the essay that's used most to point out that lots of nerds are worthless shits.<p>I don't see the point in denigrating people's passions, Bill. Paul Graham likes programming and making money. Not everybody does. Other people like to write music. Others, buying attractive clothing and learning how to look good. These things aren't inherently better than one another unless you want to buy into a specific social idea, and then we aren't required to go along with you.<p>The one thing I <i>do</i> detest are people with persecution complexes. Nerds are frequently unpopular because they insist so passionately how unpopular they are. That's unpleasant and leads to people not liking them. As I've discovered, if you talk to people about designing web sites and programming innovations, they'll still like you. You've got to understand going in what other people will be interested in and what nobody gives a fuck about, and that some people will never care, but if you know that going in, you can make delightful friends even with non-nerds.<p>The other problem is that some nerds know nothing but one specific thing, and they look down on everything else, so nobody likes them. There are people who know nothing but fashion, too, though they're rare and they're just as unpopular as nerds.",1253303727

Or perhaps I was just too terse in my list.  Here are examples of what people might be thinking with some of them:<p>- To enhance one's body (appear more attractive, muscular, thin, etc): being thin is inherently better than not, so I want to appear more thin.<p>- Self expression of any number of things: it's important to me that people not kill animals, so I'll be conspicuous in the ways I don't wear leather.<p>- Aesthetic taste: I prefer the look of the color red, so I'll wear it for my own pleasure.<p>- Entertainment: keeping up with fashion is stimulating to me, so I'll do it for fun.<p>Could you expound on why you think these things signal status in some way?",1253303658

This is a company that doesn't hire very often - only every couple of years. It's run very conservatively but successfully. They aren't big money makers, but they get by and do it while doing what they love. After going through my share of startups, where self-hate (working to death with crazy deadlines) was mistaken for passion, this crew seems a very welcome relief.<p>The company isn't a software company by nature, but they create art assets for many software companies. They are looking to expand more directly into that market and have a lot of fun projects in mind - they just want a coder of their own. I've worked with them before, and the talent at the company is quite incredible. Many programmers I know (certainly myself included) would die to be working with a team of asset creators such as this on staff. (In my experience a lot of startups are run by tech people who hire other tech people and then contract out the creative bits - this situation is the reverse and it seems like it'd be awesome.)<p>The trouble is that the job offer is low - 60% of my previous job (which was itself a reduction from the job I had before that). I believe it's as much as 50% of the going rate for software engineers in that area, even.<p>I'm presently now between jobs (which is why the offer came in the first place - they knew I was now available). If I put out feelers, I would expect I can find other offers for considerably more than theirs - but I highly doubt the experience of this place could be matched so easily. What is that worth?<p>It's an added concern because they want me to relocate and work with them in the office. I actually would like to do that. I'd kind of like to work with people in person again. After 3+ years of remote work, it can get lonely. But it feels very hard to personally justify relocation away from family to a job that pays so much less!<p>And yet it seems clear that deep down inside, I would love to try it. If I didn't want it, I wouldn't be agonizing over it in the first place. I suppose I'm just looking for advice or encouragement or perhaps shared stories of others who have given up a much larger income in search of... stability/happiness/adventure/change.",1253302341

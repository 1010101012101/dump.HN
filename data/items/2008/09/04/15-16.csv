I don't carry my passport everyday, but my public transportation card works with RFID and it's definitely not working when kept inside the wallet.

All it would have to do is run a checksum on the prototype js file and if it matches, load a precompiled version.<p>Then again, it probably wouldn't help too much, since most websites employ fancy packaging tricks to speed up javascript file load times.",1220542704

I contribute most of my time, and I fund supplies and several silicon valley salaries.<p>You can't really compare effectiveness against a university. The real product of university research programs is researchers who then go on to build real things in industry. So while in the short term I'm more likely to produce useful robots than academia, they will have more long-term effect by graduating hundreds of smart people who go on to build useful things in industry. The real measure of universities isn't how many things are invented within their walls but how many things are invented by people who were shaped by their university experience. Most people in my company did graduate research, so their respective universities deserve some of the credit for whatever we invent.",1220542521

More importantly, it comes with one unique and great advance - the fact that each tab is a separate process.<p>V8, beyond the hype, doesn't seem to do any better than the upcoming javascript engines from Apple and Mozilla.  It may be an order of magnitude better than what is currently production, but it's in the same ballpark as what Firefox and Safari will have soon.<p>Chrome is wonderful and will probably be my default browser for a while, but it's evolutionary, not revolutionary (except for the per-tab processes).  It will push the web forward faster as Google has some great minds working on it and it is very nicely polished and efficient.  It just isn't game-changing or revolutionary - it's a nice evolutionary step that's a wonderful program to use.",1220541543

I see stagnation and loss of perspective, as everything the least bit unseemly and incongruous with your hard-earned socioeconomic status is blissfully hidden.<p>You see a cramped apartment, I see living in a neighborhood with history and soul, with something more than more rows of cookie cutter houses. Where people living in highly developed places don't pretend to be living on a ""ranch"", ""glade"", or ""estate"". Where there is so much life teeming around you that walking home is a treat, not a chore.<p>Putting it that way, no wonder the same money buys a big house in the burbs... I mean, there's gotta be something to justify all that you lose by leaving the city.<p>It's all perspective I am merely telling you that not as many tech workers enjoy the suburban thing as you seem to think.

(b) this is often different for different groups of people. You now have to implement a privacy system that works for every piece of content, for every set of users that I want to define a setting for. I think you'll quickly come to something fairly complicated. There are very smart people trying to come up with abstractions and interfaces that make this easy to do, but I fear that at the end of the day, users are simply going to have to learn some new tricks if they don't want to be surprised.

I'm sorry you think that I'm doing a poor job of defending Facebook, because I think in that a lot of the criticisms are inaccurate and come from a poor understanding of the privacy policies, the motivations and implications. Admittedly, this is mostly because they are insanely complicated, and we need to do a much better job educating people. We (where that includes me and all the people I know at Facebook) care <i>very</i> much about doing the right thing for users while still innovating and giving users the most utility we can.

The problem is that the words themselves carry an intrinsic charge; they create an outsized potential for negative thoughts and impressions in the listener regardless of intent. There are neutral, more purely descriptive words that equally easy to use in conversations, and so it makes sense to push the negatively charged terms out.<p>Fashions will change, but Paul Graham is accidentally creating the impression that fashion is purely random. It is not. The word &quot;retard&quot; as a reference for the mentally handicapped is not going to come back into fashion; it has been obsoleted by a better understanding of both the processes of mental and developmental disability and of the role of the mentally handicapped in society.<p>Which is all for the better, because the <i>verb</i> &quot;retard&quot; is useful, and it would be great if fashion made it less clumsy sounding in normal speech.",1384106394

They haven&#x27;t figured out how to properly monetize their own platforms fully just yet, much less the rest of the Web.<p>Which also helps to explain why they get rated so poorly on return-on-investment when it comes to ad spending.<p>I&#x27;d say the last year has been a substantial break-through for Facebook in terms of pushing their ad systems forward and getting wide adoption of it (including finally getting mobile to spit dollars). Maybe a couple more years of developing their advertising platform and they&#x27;ll get there.<p>I also think there&#x27;s a general underestimation of how good the Google ad system is overall, and how hard it is to compete with.",1384106351

The move to stop using those terms was not about just changing the word, but also recognizing mental disorders as something distinct from a person&#x27;s inherent nature.<p>(Again, similar to the move from &quot;negroes&quot; to &quot;black people&quot;.

6707562,comment,6707021,6707517,16,0,chimeracoder,,,"> I do want to point out that Google+, with old features or new, has never violated the ACLs that users set. If you set something to private, it remains private forever.<p>I know that, which is why I used the example of Facebook.<p>However, Google+ <i>does</i> make it incredibly easy to leak information that I would otherwise consider private accidentally.<p>For example, I can&#x27;t use Google+ with my primary email address, as it&#x27;s a Google+ account. However, because it&#x27;s linked with my Gmail account (which does have a Google+ account), some people who have added me on Google+ have been able to figure out my Gmail address (which I haven&#x27;t used for email purposes in years[0]).<p>I can imagine all the technical reasons for this, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it feels a bit wrong for a service to hand out my old email address (which I never give out anymore) to people I&#x27;ve met recently and who have added me on Google+ <i>using my current email address</i>.<p>Imagine your Google+ email address is something that you can&#x27;t change, but don&#x27;t really want people to see anymore - this isn&#x27;t uncommon; it appeared in a New York Times piece just yesterday, in the context of college admissions[1]. Thankfully, my personal email address is much more tame than that student&#x27;s, but that still doesn&#x27;t mean I want anybody to know or use it nowadays.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to sign up &quot;accidentally&quot; to use Youtube with Google+ and your &quot;real name&quot; instead of continuing to use your pseudonym.<p>As for the distinction you point out - I know the difference, and you know the difference. But most users don&#x27;t.<p>>  To do otherwise would be corporate suicide.<p>Apparently not <i>completely</i> - Facebook&#x27;s gotten away with it for <i>years</i>![2]<p>[0] This may have been fixed, since it was a while ago that I last noticed, but it was still the case for quite a while.<p>I would have to go through my inbox to remember the details of why this happened - I remember debugging and tracking it down. But the fact that it took that much effort to discover why my new acquaintances suddenly knew my old (personal) email address, and that I can&#x27;t remember anymore, speaks volumes as to how easy it would be for a less savvy user to accidentally leak information that they wanted to keep private.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/they-loved-your-gpa-then-they-saw-your-tweets.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/they-loved-your-g...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/</a>  - this graph doesn&#x27;t distinguish clearly between those which were automatically retroactive and those which weren&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s a topic that&#x27;s been well-reported and is easy to search for.",1384106090

6707556,comment,6706011,6707205,9,0,gexla,,,"Sure, death happens in large numbers every day. Why mourn these 10,000 deaths any more than any other deaths from around the world? We probably shouldn&#x27;t. Because death is natural and unavoidable, it isn&#x27;t necessarily tragic by itself.<p>Your community, your system, is able to absorb the deaths which happen within that community. People in your community die from old age, traffic accidents, disease and many other ways, but the wheels of the system keep spinning. In the case of the Philippines, the recent tsunamis and other large scale natural disasters, entire communities were obliterated. These systems have completely broken down. In Leyte, 10,000 people died, but the system which supported tens of thousands more living is broken.<p>The local economy for many of these people has been pushed back to the stone ages. The rich still have their bank accounts intact. They can jump on a plane and start over somewhere else. The poor don&#x27;t have this option. There is no functioning system there to support the people who have to stay there. They have nothing to eat, no money for medicine, nowhere to live and they are completely dependent on a government with relatively little resources. Restoring this system will take months if not years. Many people will never fully recover. Future generations will get held back from what they could have been. There&#x27;s not much of a safety net here.<p>ETA: And sure, the ripples of this shock won&#x27;t go much further than the borders of the Philippines. But I think Fukishima might be a good counter to your &quot;natural disasters as a side show&quot; argument. We don&#x27;t yet know how much this disaster will affect us.

It&#x27;s one of the dumbest economic concepts ever devised.<p>Trickle-down is a goofy name for capital investment. Meaning, rich people have capital, they allocate it where they can earn a return. Nothing can ever actually alter this premise, it will exist even in the most Communist of nations; so calling anything trickle-down is absurd, it&#x27;s all trickle-down, even when it&#x27;s the Communist Party in the USSR that is the rich and doing the trickling down. In a healthy economy, job creation goes hand-in-hand with that capital investment, it&#x27;s no more complex than that.<p>Normally a booming stock market is the result of widespread economic growth - that is, in the absence of the Fed generating huge imbalances in the economy that spur an artificial stock market boom.<p>This (the Fed trying to acquire the result without the cause) is the same exact reason we&#x27;re seeing non-existent job creation.

6707366,comment,6694934,6701116,1,0,Wilduck,,,"Sure, I can answer some of those questions. I&#x27;ll start off by saying that you&#x27;re right that the process will be more difficult as a non-native English speaker. But, after you&#x27;ve sent the first few email, you should be able to see patterns between them, and you&#x27;ll end up with a standard opening email and a standard set of responses. Also, it helps to have a friend glance over the email. I&#x27;m a native speaker and I still used my friends to occasionally proof read my work.<p>As for who to contact in the company, I would say that you try to contact the person who would be your direct supervisor in your new position. They&#x27;re going to be the person who is best able to evaluate whether you are a good fit for the job, and if they decide they want to hire you, they&#x27;ll make it much easier to go through all the paperwork. If you don&#x27;t know who your supervisor would be and it&#x27;s a large company, try to find a senior engineer at the company. If it&#x27;s a small company you could contact the CEO. These people at least will have a decent idea of what positions are available and who you&#x27;ll need to contact to talk about them. Avoid HR at all costs. Also, since most &quot;careers@companyname.com&quot; email addresses go straight to HR, try to avoid those as well. Finding the email addresses can sometimes be tricky, but I was usually able to find something by googling peoples names/positions/companies.<p>When I say &quot;make it as easy as possible for them to get back to me&quot; it&#x27;s less that I&#x27;m trying to write a simple letter, and more that I&#x27;m only asking them for a small thing. Asking someone for a job is a large thing to ask for. Even asking for an interview is a large time commitment. You simply want to ask them for information about the positions they have available. After you&#x27;ve received that first email it is much easier to turn around and propose a time to talk on the phone.<p>I&#x27;ll give you an example, from start to finish of what this conversation could look like. I&#x27;ve written the first email such that you could fill in the blanks and send it off. I&#x27;ve structured it such that the person reading could read the first paragraph and immediately respond (the phrase &quot;what follows is a brief description of a recent project&quot; tells them that if they want to skip that paragraph and just email you back they can). The project is probably the best way to do three sentences about yourself, but if you wanted to change it to highlight more soft skills you could.<p>------------------------------------------<p>First email to a company:<p>------------------------------------------<p>Subject: What&#x27;s happening at <Company Name>?<p>Hi <Contact Name>,<p>My name is Hyunwoona and I&#x27;m a Computer Science student at <College Name>, with a focus on <Technical Skill relevant to the job>. I&#x27;ve been looking for internships, and came across <company name>. I was particularly interested in <specific thing the company is doing>.

Second, upon seeing how the C++ people intend to fix deficiencies of C++ by throwing even more features at it, it&#x27;s very difficult to see it in any other way. Third, the only &quot;anti-intellectualism&quot; I see here is named C++: It&#x27;s actually symptomatic of certain organizations that instead of trying to see the big picture and really fix things in a systematic way, they &quot;anti-intellectually&quot; hack and tweak and tinker and micro-optimize. For example, IBM has been doing that in the 1960s with their HW architectures before they got their shit mostly together, which is why the ACS project failed, only for it to be rediscovered forty years later, with modern CPUs <i>finally</i> (!) utilizing these ancient but very well working techniques, such as superscalar out-of-order design that will celebrate its fiftieth birthday in a few years. Now, the same breed of people who ditched ACS in the 1960s are apparently in charge of design of mainstream languages.

The only nit I really disagree with you on in this post is that it&#x27;s certainly reasonable that you should have to manually determine how to capture variables in a closure, in C++, because of the nature of the language.  Also, many other languages avoid the multiple inheritance diamond simply by not allowing multiple inheritance (and others do it a bit better).  The other questions, you know the answer to, and the answer is very obviously performance or compatibility with C (or just bugs in the language).  But I&#x27;m not claiming that C++ is less annoying to use.  I&#x27;m saying it has better facilities for making high-level abstractions.  That&#x27;s because of its type system, and you have to go to something like Scala, Haskell, or other statically typed languages, or maybe something homoiconic like Lisp, or something odd like Oz, to really beat.  You can make better, more accurate abstractions in C++ than in other mainstream languages, and they&#x27;re safe and solid, while in languages like C# you often end up having to resort to unsafe conversions.",1384102833

Yes, such structs can have member functions, but they change little except to act as a convenience. A &quot;naked struct&quot; in C++ is called a POD (&quot;Plain Old Data&quot;) type, and there are a few rules to ensure your structure meets that definition. The standard library has a type trait to test a class/struct to see if it meets that definition (called std::is_pod).<p>> For example, constructors, destructors, virtual functions, namespaces.<p>None of these actually interfere with any use cases or domain that I can think of. Constructors and destructors are insanely valuable features, even if you use nothing else.

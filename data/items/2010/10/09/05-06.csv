I can't tell you how many clients have e-mailed me saying 'My site is down!' or 'My site takes a few minutes to load', even though the site loads in about a second in Safari. When I switch over to my (un-extended) Firefox install, I suddenly see the problem - literally dozens of Javascripts, image requests, tracking pixels, and other junk.<p>It's ridiculous. At one company we had a client who spent the last year contracting us to add widgets and pixels and add-ons and buttons and everything, until suddenly they found out that Google would be factoring in page load times into their search results. Suddenly it was a rock and a hard place - do they keep adding content without any proof of its value? But that would hurt their search rankings - but but but, it adds value! It encourages engagement!<p>It's ridiculous. They didn't even have any metrics showing that any of the stuff they were adding was helping, or even being used. Likewise with the search widgets. People are told that these things will 'drive user engagement' and 'encourage social interaction', so they throw it in and assume that it's made their site better.",1286603961

1774463,comment,1770435,1770435,0,0,Natsu,,,"Actually, I've been thinking about ways to improve education.<p>Many of them are already out there for those motivated to seek them.  With MIT's stuff online, you can learn from them for free.  A lot of more basic stuff is also out there if you know how to look for it.<p>But there are a lot of teachers out there who have their education budgets spent on crazy toys and scoreboards that don't do the kids a whole lot of good.  Educational software is a mixed bag, though I have fond memories of Number Munchers.  I don't know if that led me to learning as much math as I did, but it sure didn't hurt.<p>Right now, a lot of money is wasted on new versions of textbooks.  Most of the underlying material hasn't changed and isn't really going to, except for the meddling of various government types who want to add or delete things they disagree with from the curriculum.  Most of the publishers have been around for ages.  I have to think there's some opportunity for someone to automate certain kinds of tests.<p>For example, simple math tests could more easily be randomized and each student could have their own set of problems (no more photocopies with kids cheating off the guy next to them).  Word problems can be autogenerated.  Stuff like that.<p>Unfortunately, most of my knowledge comes second-hand.  My mother was a teacher, but she's dead now, so whatever I know about the problems they face has probably gotten out of date.  But I have a feeling that education money, especially their tech budgets, getting spent on things that do little good is something that probably hasn't changed.  I have to think that there are still quite a few things that could be improved.",1286603545

I'm my experience, however, I had more to do with my own motivation in school than my parents. I tried harder when scores mattered. Throughout elementary school, I spent most of my school time day-dreaming and most of my time outside of class blowing off homework. I could deal with being scolded by parents and teachers. My parents cared how I did in school, but I didn't.<p>When grades started to matter in middle and high school, my competitive side came out. I decided I was going to get better grades than most because that would lead to a future with more options. I also cared more because my peers cared more and I was socially self-conscious. When I started trying harder, I started learning more and became genuinely interested in subject matter. My grades lead to me getting into a good college where students were far more motivated on average than my high school. That ended up being where I met my best friends and eventual startup co-founder.<p>Did my best learning experiences come from studying for tests? No, they came less structured classes and from my own programming projects during and after college. However, I do feel that grades and standardized tests lit a fire under my booty to try harder and eventually led to me meeting more motivated people.",1286602292

1774416,comment,1774156,1774296,0,0,Alex3917,,,"It's largely propaganda designed to promote Bill Gates' version of white supremacy dressed up as school reform. They're not advocating that Exeter replace its curriculum with KIPP, what they're advocating is for low-income minorities only. And the curriculum isn't designed based on the best practices from educational research, but rather it's designed to change the culture of minorities (to quote the NYT).[1]<p>The fact is that poor kids learn just as much or more in school as wealthy kids, they just start several years behind because of bad parenting.[2] And over the summers when wealthy kids are learning and going forward, the poor kids are actually going backwards.[3] Which is why the average 13 year old white kid has the same standardized test scores as the average 17 year old black kid.[4]<p>In addition, one of the most famous findings from all of education research is that within-school effects are greater than between-school effects.[3] That means that school tracking has a much greater impact on how much your child learns than whether they go to a good school or a bad school. (The movie touches on tracking but doesn't really explain it.) Especially since kids are sorted into tracks based more on their race and looks than on their ability. [5]<p>Anyway all the problems the movie mentions are completely true, and they need to be solved, but spreading good parenting best-practices and the changing systemic design of school itself are much better solutions than implementing KIPP, which as far as I can tell (after reading a bunch of articles and a book on it) is a huge step in the wrong direction. There is zero evidence that the program works at all in the long term, especially since it conflicts with all of the research on intrinsic motivation. These kids might make some academic gains in the short term, but in the long term it's hard to believe that they'll be anywhere near as well off as even middle class Americans. The fact that these programs produce decent test results in the short term has basically zero predictive value for determining the long term outcomes. Maybe they'll be better than I think, who knows, but advocating replacing our current school system with this for only low-income minorities without having the longterm data is a huge scam.<p>It's a shame because the Harlem Children Zone actually has a great baby college program for parents, but the movie just mentions this in passing. In reality programs like would be an excellent use of tax dollars because they are actually consistent (for the most part) with the current research on best practices for parenting, unlike KIPP which is just completely pulled out of some guy's ass. (Although most of these programs don't yet show good longterm results, so more tweaking is needed.)<p>It says a lot about America that our most popular school reform movie is targeted at people who don't read books.<p>/rant<p>[1] ""Can the culture of child-rearing be changed in poor neighborhoods, and if so, is that a project that government or community organizations have the ability, or the right, to take on?"" <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/magazine/26tough.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/magazine/26tough.html</a><p>[2] C.f.

1774394,comment,1774156,1774301,0,0,nkassis,,,"I think one of the major issues with standardized test is how they are structured. I spent most of my education in Canada (Quebec) and we had test government created test at the end of the semester for each subject. These test were usually used to adjust the grades given during the semester to more reflect the performance on this test. Teachers could give you all As but the end of semester test would tell if you really learn most of what the class was supposed to teach.<p>I finish high school (last 2 years) in Florida where I had to take the FCAT. The first thing that I found dumb about this test was that it wasn't at all tied to the subjects I was learning. It was meant to test more generic level concepts, in turn this exam was a pure joke and proved nothing other than a lot of kids have trouble writing an essay.<p>My point is, standardized test should be used to keep similar classes at different schools from diverging too much curriculum wise. An algebra class at school X shouldn't be completely off from the same course at school Y. Testing random problem solving skills and language isn't going to help with that.",1286601343

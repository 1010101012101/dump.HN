I read an interesting paper about some grammatical trick you could do in Germanic languages, but not in English. Why? Maybe because, in this way, Celtic was shining through? No, non-British-aisles Celtic has the same trick. The paper speculated that it was a remnant of the grammar of pre-Celtic, pre-historic Briton.

The first problem is that using prior art before a trial is legally risky. If you fail to invalidate a patent (and you might fail on a technicality like not documenting the prior art in exactly the way the patent office wants to see it), you don't get to bring up that prior art later. Second, good prior art searches (necessary if you want to have the best chance at a challenge) aren't cheap. They could easily waste their effort on patents that turn out not to be an issue at trial (patents that are relatively easy to work around, become less important because of the way the market evolves, dropped during the legal process because they seem to be relatively weaker claims and so on). The companies suing generally throw lots of patents at the wall to see what will stick. There's no sense in helping them sort that out before you have to.",1342858994

4274315,comment,4264268,4264268,3,0,eddy_chan,,,"Some general advice that's helped me improve productivity since I started working for myself rather than for the man.<p>1) Don't ""multi-task"" ever. Make a plan and then do everything on the plan in serial and make sure you focus 100% effort at the task/project at hand. My immediate to-do list is only ever 2 items long. 2 items only because I am working on #1 and when I finish #1 I need to know that #2 is the next thing that needs to be done. When #2 becomes your focus you move it to #1 and add a new item.<p>I do this at the macro level i.e my startup has 2 big projects to be shipped, I'm not going to put any effort/thought into anything that comes after, only what I need to finish right now. I also do it on the micro level, each feature has X user stories, I only have have 2 of these on my daily to-do list at any time.<p>2) Use timers like Pomodoro technique - I don't subscribe to the whole philosophy, I just enjoy the fact that a physical 25min timer gets me over the 'procrastination hump' for getting started. Keep working in 25 min chunks till said task at hand from (1) is done.<p>3) For pesky ongoing stuff add some rules to your life e.g I must publish a blog post every Wednesday (and I'm not going home till I do)<p>4) Whenever you finish a large project that might've taken you a few weeks to complete, give yourself some time to decompress and admire the work you've done.",1342858428

The collective actions of everyone else at the company, if the company is not run pathologically, exist solely to pursue the goals of the CEO.  The CEO sets the goals: describes what it is that this group of people does, what value they offer to the world at large.<p>You may not like that that's the way it works, but I think it's impossible for the CEO to <i>fail</i> to have a huge impact unless the company's run terribly.  I also think it should be trivial to see that, given that the CEO has such a huge impact on the direction the output of this large number of employees takes, that the CEO's actions have an enormous impact on the value the company provides, and consequently the profit the company derives.<p>If the CEO of Yahoo decided that their best move was to pursue 1990s era AltaVista style search, combined with the idea of 'being a homepage' (which afaict is their current strategy, plus destroying good products), I think it'd be hard for you to NOT recognize that they would be destroying value in the company at a much higher rate than $150M/year.  The CEO, personally, would have that impact.  If the employees were more efficient at their jobs, or less efficient, it would have little impact (rounding error) in the overall impact of this policy pursuit.<p>CEOs <i>are</i> the company, for many purposes.

http://adtmag.com/articles/2012/07/13/report-says-agile-a-scam.aspx<p>My company has applied Agile patchily, and so this is very important for me as an issue that is live and difficult - there are highly valued employees who passionately advocate it and produce very significant and high quality work while using it, but we are simply unable to use it with some teams and projects, and worse, we have tried in the past in other places in the business and suffered some failures.<p>I feel we lack real evidence.<p>The ""Hated Slashdot"" has a long uniformed discussion on the topic, but I wondered if HN people had specific insights on either killer arguments & studies around using or not using Agile or specific anecdotes that could be used in the debate?",1342858154

Actively preventing diversity can clearly be negative e.g. refusing to hire women, but blindly promoting diversity for the sake of it can be just as bad.<p>I would be interested in seeing the questionnaire. The article frames the question in a way that could easily mean ""Should companies have a diverse range of skills in their workforce?"" which most people would answer positively to. Asking whether they should try to hire people with diverse skill sets could elicit more divided responses.",1342857779

If questions are broad or open ended, the value lies in the discussion, not in any particular answer. I also found that many accepted answers are blatantly wrong.

No GUI-based F/OSS  product has ever achieved the level of polish and usability of things like Sparrow because the people working on open source projects only want to do coding, they don't care about design, bug detection, documentation or, God forbid, user interfaces.

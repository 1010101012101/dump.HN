When I visited the page, it was running a banner for Netflix, a banner for Bathroom Vanities and text links to Bathroom and Bathroom Show Room. None of those are relevant and I doubt you'll make a significant amount of money from them. As for which ads to use? It's hard to say yet but I agree with true_religion that CPA is probably the way to go with this niche, just don't make it more prominent than your content.",1298926762

2272877,comment,2272150,2272570,0,0,Benjo,,,"I agree. The free market and competition have created more value than any other tool in human history and it's absolutely the best tool for this job. There seems to be a common misconception that free markets will arise naturally and any government involvement will jeopordize them. In reality, government is the method that a capitalist society must use to ensure that no resources are undervalued; that the system is truly generating value, not just moving it from one place to another at a loss. In the case of energy, the role of goverment should be to determine the immediate value and future costs fossil fuel energy production.<p>In practice of course, goverment is too heavily influenced by those who currently happen to have the most resources. As a result, they are incapable of correctly evaluating the true value of immediate energy output versus future greenhouse gas levels. It makes the question of how to solve the energy problem moot, because there's no way to implement that solution under the current political conditions.",1298926752

I assume at some point I'll be asked to move again from the shared smart machines as they currently exist (which, as near as I can tell, are identical to the shared accelerators), and I'm cool with that.<p>But because you (Jason) appear to be actively monitoring this thread, I'm going to make a suggestion:<p>E-mail everyone on the old BSD textdrive servers and tell them that they really should migrate.<p>Tell the month-to-month customers that you're end-of-lifing that product and on February 29th of 2012 (because nothing ever happens on Feb 29th) it will no longer be there. If you like, offer them whatever account is similar to the one they're on with a 50% discount 1 year discount if they take you up on it in the next month, 25% the three months following that and 10% up to the 29th.<p>For the VC customers just tell it how it is. You will continue to support the systems for however long you need to, but the newer stuff is just better. You appreciate their trust in your company etc. but they will probably be happier with the shinier stuff if they migrate.<p>Then follow up every couple of months with another e-mail. You could even make it interesting and say what percentage of VCs have migrated, what cool new stuff is available to those who have moved etc. (though if you do that, I'd like to receive those e-mails too).<p>If you want to incentivize the move for the stragglers, go ahead, their bitching pisses me off anyway and if you can get them to move and STFU by offering them something I didn't get, that's fine by me.<p>But most importantly send an e-mail. Don't post on the forum, or on the blog, or the wiki. I know that the forum, RSS feeds and blog are how Joyent likes to communicate but e-mail goes into my inbox. If I don't pay attention to it I'm the only one to blame.<p>If two or three years down the line people still haven't migrated. EOL the BSD servers. I'm pretty confident the ""lifetime"" I paid for was for lifetime of hosting with particular storage, server access, and bandwidth levels, not lifetime of hosting on a single machine with a particular OS. I could be wrong, but I think it's reasonable to assume that your hosting provider will change technologies as time progresses.

Those traits are germain to any business, but in the startup game you have to understand that you're making certain sacrifices in exchange for greater reward at the end. If you see no end, then you have to ask yourself the following:<p>Do I share the company's vision?<p>If the answer is ""no"", then pack your bags (fire up resume, get job first) because life will not get better for you even if the company succeeds in meeting their short or long term goals.<p>If the answer is 'yes', then you have to realistically determine if your personal success is tied to the company's. Will you be compensated adequately once the company achieves success (sale, merger, continued investment)? Is that compensation commensurate with what you'd be making at a similar firm? What is your opportunity cost for not pursuing those same goals (cashing out) at a similar firm? And, realistically speaking, can you remain at the company without losing your mind or getting fired in order to complete your personal goals (vesting period)?<p>In most cases, any given Friday is a good time to leave a startup as you'll have an entire weekend to relax and get over leaving an unhappy situation and begin to work on your future. Most people are tied into their job and don't leave because they're unsure if they'll be able to obtain similar or better employment elsewhere on their own. If you have the skills to work somewhere else and you've proven that you can do your current job, I'd start floating my resume out there and test the waters. It's best to do it while still employed (note to self)!<p>And when asked, ""why are you unhappy in your current position"" simply respond ""I no longer share their vision.""",1298925800

For a human user of W|A, he will construct the query with certain syntax, and further drill down the search query with W|A's recommendations. W|A may very well monitor the pattern of user search queries to optimize their search algorithm. It is possible that programmed search queries, especially coming from a third party application where users do not use the W|A like syntax, may ""pollute"" the usage pattern for W|A and affect their algorithm's efficiency.

There are two ways to sell to people: logic and trust.<p>My approach was logic.  I would spend as much time as was necessary very methodically detailing all the reasons why Macs were superior to PCs, and I did it in a way that made it obvious I was a fan and not just a salesman. It took a long time to make these sales, but I was good at it and converted literally hundreds of people to $1000+ Macs, most of which came in to buy a $500 PC.  A lot of people do respond positively to technical facts and information.<p>However, there was another salesman who didn't give a rats ass about which solution was best, and based what he sold entirely on the spiffs he would get for selling them, most of which were based off how many accessories and service plans he sold with the computer. He consistently beat me in sales every day and could barely tell you the difference between firewire and usb (insert nerd chortle). He didn't need the technical knowhow.  He would talk to them about completely unrelated things - the weather, their kids, the local sports team, etc. I'd look over at his customers and they'd be laughing and smiling, and then look at mine and see skeptical frowns. But his customers would have an entire cart full of crap they didn't need and the whole process was complete within about 15 minutes.<p>Most people just want to feel comfortable when they shop.  They want a friend to tell them what to buy, not a salesman, so the quicker you can establish yourself as ""one of the good guys"" the better.<p>My only consolation was that my return rates were far lower than his.",1298925577

2272682,comment,2271983,2272103,0,0,bradleyland,,,"Probably because there's nothing new here. Controlling physical access to a network is a long standing problem with a wide variety of solutions. As with any security technology, these solutions are imperfect, but the plug computer only brings a couple new factors to the table: it doesn't look like a computer and it is extremely small, so it's very concealable.<p>Neither of these contribute significantly to your exposure any more than something like a laptop or netbook. Concealment helps protect against casual detection, but many offices are littered with spare laptops that no one pays any attention to any way. This is especially true in IT departments where systems may sit on shelves for days or weeks waiting for repair. The notion that a plug computer may be hard to find once identified sounds scary, but in practice, it's a non-issue. You simply identify the port to which the device is connected, unplug it, then trace the cable back to its termination point. I'm going to ignore wireless, because no sensible security plan involves a WiFi network attached to their private network. You segregate wireless in the DMZ, then allow WiFi users to connect to a VPN endpoint using strong encryption.<p>Any business concerned about securing their networks has implemented policies like shutting interfaces that aren't in use, and authenticating access at the Ethernet level using 802.1X. Neither of these are foolproof, but depending upon how secure you want to be, you build up security at every layer: physical, Ethernet, VPN, application.",1298923693

But how about as an employee at a startup? At what point are the warning signs bad enough that its time to pack your bags?<p>I'm a very early employee at a startup (full-time before the founders were full-time). We have a product and have annual revenues near $500k. On the tech side of things, I love what I do. On the people side, it's miserable. On the compensation side, needs improvement (neither options, nor salary are industry-competitive).<p>The founder/management team is shockingly incompetent. We are a model example of all the negative traits of founder's syndrome. ( http://managementhelp.org/misc/founders.htm ) There is a culture of blame. The same mistakes happen again and again. Customers are treated poorly (it is a testament only to our niche that new customers keep calling us.) We do not advertise because, as the founder said, ""What if someone ordered 100!?!? Then what would we do?""<p>After a recent $1M investment, they actually said, ""Now that we have money, things will be better."" Things are not better, but easy access to cash has certainly covered up the worst issues for the moment.<p>So how about it? When is it bad enough that an employee should jump ship?

That's how markets in the USA are intended to work, so I guess it's a reasonable assumption, if you're completely ignorant of the state of telecom in the USA.<p>Just as an example, Verizon decided that my home state of New Hampshire wasn't a desirable market any more for terrestrial broadband.  So they sold their franchise (basically a state-granted monopoly over the region) to FairPoint.  The state only agreed to give the franchise to FairPoint after FP promised to extend fiber deployment throughout the state, and meet certain access requirements to poor and hard-to-reach areas.  (This is why the monopoly is considered a fair tradeoff: the company makes their money on a captive audience in the higher-margin cities, and the state gets guaranteed service to negative-margin rural areas.)  Well, it turns out FP were lying through their teeth, have no fiber capability whatsoever, and don't have enough money to improve the infrastructure at all.  Verizon shareholders lost over 1 billion dollars, but the trouble is that there is <i>no competition</i> for residential broadband left in the state.  In some places, you can get 1.5 Mb/s DSL (which the FCC admits doesn't count as ""broadband""), a few places you can get Comcast cable, but there are a lot of places where there's just nothing available.  And since we're not a desirable market, there's no chance of getting any other companies to deploy to those areas.  NH is screwed for the foreseeable future.<p>tl;dr No one on any side who's been paying attention would make those claims.  Status quo is state-granted monopolies, so it's up to the state to enforce reasonable rules on the ISPs.",1298923464

83362,comment,83290,83350,0,0,pg,,,"I haven't noticed them paying undue attention to startups they've invested in.  And all reporters cover who they know, in the sense that they put more emphasis on info that comes from trusted sources.

83356,comment,83348,83348,0,0,pixcavator,,,"This is a good post (and other posts below). But... ""scientists"" is not a descriptive word. If you are talking about biologists, they'd gain more from knowing high school math than from programming. Math majors on the other hand need to program if they want to find jobs outside the actuarial field. Same for physics and chemistry. A regular C++/Java course should be enough to get started.",1196017547

That will never happen because of the various differences between clients. This is the magic of the browser - people bitch about cross-browser incompatibilities, however because of the browser's simplicity it gets as close to ""frictionless"" as possible.<p>And you won't replicate that unless you invent something that's for all practical purposes still a browser.<p>(you mentioned deb, try upgrading an Ubuntu box sometimes)<p><pre><code>     Is there a single point of the web that cannot
     be replicated in native-land?
</code></pre>
This is the wrong question to ask. You're not seeing the forest from the trees.<p>The web is great because of its extreme simplicity. Trying to replicate that would get you yet another browser-like technology, that's broken in new ways nonetheless, or it will make you deal with even greater complexity - I don't know about you but it was extremely painful for me to even get a Hello World installed on my own iPhone.<p>Either way, talking about ""replication"" is missing the point.<p><pre><code>     One major benefit that the web has is that
</code></pre>
The benefit you mention isn't even the main benefit of the web. The main benefit is that the web is available everywhere for everybody, with no discrimination.<p>When you send a link to a friend, you don't ask him whether he has access to your App Store or not. The web's availability is implied (after all, that's probably how your friend received the link in the first place).<p><pre><code>     Ubiquiteness: you can have the same app in

3349754,comment,3349431,3349431,16,0,umjames,,,"> There isnt a shortage of developers and designers. Theres a surplus of founders.<p>This is especially true of non-tech companies looking to hire quality people for positions in their IT departments.<p>I currently work in such an IT department and we have a position for a J2EE developer to write portlets for our up-and-coming Liferay portal.  Needless to say, we can't find anyone good (outside of recruiters, which we'd rather not use) to fill this position.  My boss has asked each of us if we know anyone we can recommend for this position.  As far as I know, no such luck.<p>Personally, I'm not the least surprised.  None of the developers that I know would even touch a job like this.  Most don't/won't do J2EE.  Portals never really took off like corporate America hoped it would (and Gartner said it would).  I have some things that I'm working on on the side, and if/when that becomes something, I'll be headed out the door too.<p>What my employer fails to understand is that they are hiring as if it was still 1998.  Developers now have options and no longer have to settle for jobs like this.  Their competition is no longer other IT departments, it's freedom of choice itself.",1323817099

There are pages where that is possible, but typically, at the very least, browsers need to download some css, too (for example, google.com, on my system, does 9 http requests of which one fails). Even with inline css, a browser can discover, halfway through a file, that some css moves a div up top, floats it, etc.<p>Add to that 'not everybody' specifies image dimensions in the HTML and that Javascript that runs on page load may do DOM updates, and you get a much more complex model. Deciding when to start rendering a page is somewhat of a black art. If you wait until you are sure you have all information you need, the browser will appear slow; if you do not, you will have to restart page layout sometimes.<p><i>""in a fraction of a second or two""</i><p>Pages that load at that speed are rare. Again taking google.com as example, it loads almost 200kB here (most of it from cache, but that would not be much different in what I envision). When running from cache, rendering that simple page takes about half a second, I guess (FireBug reports 700ms and up, but it will have some overhead)",1323817079
3349750,comment,3348858,3349566,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Wait, what?<p>Why do you argue that members of the public or of an insurance pool have no interest in minimizing the economic cost to them of reckless drivers' risky behavior? Sure, if you drive everywhere at 100 mph and we buy auto insurance from the same company, your direct impact on my premium is minimal, maybe a few cents extra annually, because your increased risk is spread out across a large pool of insureds. But risky drivers exist in quantity too, and collectively their impact on the cost of insurance is large, as is the drag they create on GDP or taxes.<p>Certainly, I think that vehicle telemetry data should be available to defendants in driving-related criminal cases or litigation. And as a matter of fact, it is, via the legal procedure of discovery. You seem to think that this should only be available to the defendant, but never to prosecutors or plaintiffs. Why not? If you're driving on the public highway, then your driving behavior is a matter of public concern to the extent that it impacts others; and to the extent that other people are exposed to the risks arising from your operation of a vehicle, you cannot reasonably claim an expectation of privacy - unless you're willing to move to a regime of strict liability for accidents, and pay correspondingly higher insurance premiums.",1323817037

The list you gave- I've done all of those things. Well, change Machu Picchu to Pompeii and Somalia to the Congo. I realize your list was not comprehensive- but let me realize the spirit of your post and say I've done a large subset of the ""things I'd like to do before I die,"" save perhaps going into space or winning a Nobel prize and few others.<p>I made a pact with myself when I was miserable in high-school and my most suicidal, that I would give life a chance and see if things got better as I did more and more things I'd dreamed about and that people told me were worth living for as you've done now. If I did those things and was still unhappy, I felt I should be justified in ending my own life having given it fair chance.<p>Well, there was a moment, I rememember it in detail, where I was hang-gliding near Interlaken in Switzerland. A man near me said something to the order of ""this is the time of our lives, huh!"" And I realized then that not only was I still quite unhappy in this most excellent of situations, but that I still wanted to kill myself and indeed had never stopped wanting to kill myself. Not at the Louvre, not in Tokyo, not when succeeding financially, romantically, or in academics.<p>There was a quote in the Brother's Karmazov which has always troubled me, though I can't find it at the moment, when Alyosha tells a child that he ""will always be an unhappy man"" and the child says he knows. I believe myself to be fundamentally broken somehow genetically, and I feel that I no longer have any rational reason to expect to ever feel content as a person or free of the suicidal impulse. I will always be an unhappy man.<p>I can only assume there are others like me in this realization, and to them your words will seem hollow, cliche, and unrelatably foreign. To them what you've said is no different from ""but you have so much to live for""- they know that and it doesn't matter. If such a person is out there and is now reading this, all I can say is, well, me too. I keep going somehow, who knows how or why, and I guess all things considered sometimes it really isn't so bad. If I can't ever silence the demons telling me to end it all, I can at least make noise somewhere else that they don't seem so loud.

The ""I'm awesome because I didn't pirate this"" attitude?<p>I'll admit I've pirated things, and I'll admit that I did feel good about myself for buying this video. The good feeling, in my mind, had nothing to do with having paid rather than pirated. I liked that he was bucking convention, and trying his own distribution model, and the lack of DRM and just eliminating all, or as many barriers as possible. I wanted to support the effort.<p>He gave the public a clean product, priced it very reasonably (even cheaply), and he made a profit on it. Now, in this case the business model was 'Be Louis C.K.', and it probably wouldn't work for some up and comer, but I was actually surprised to find in this article that he had already made a profit (he said on reddit that he had yet to really push the marketing for this, so I'm assuming there will be additional profit to come for a while).<p>I'd absolutely love to see Louis leverage the infrastructure he's built for this experiment into something more substantial - licensing other artists to release their works themselves through his site, rolling the profits into new development, and see where it goes.<p>Maybe I'm just deluding myself, and I'm just masking an ""I'm the greatest for not pirating this"" attitude behind a veneer of ""supporting new media"". I don't know. I just know that torrenting this video never even occurred to me. I had heard of this experiment, and thought it was a cool idea. Then, a friend told that he'd really enjoyed it, so I gave in and threw $5 at it and laughed my ass off at the video (if you haven't seen it, I do recommend it).",1323816069

Consider the loss to the economy of 30,000 people a year, plus the cost of people who are 'just' injured; there's no #s on that FARS page but I've seen estimates of  $250-350 billion a year, which is near 2% of GDP.

This shift hasn't taken root yet and I think you're going to see a lot of startups that succeed caught on to the fact that the extra early-stage equity they can retain (due to less onerous funding) is best given to the first N employees than held onto by the founders. Taking the equity the VC's normally would have gotten and giving it to your first several employees now opens the door for you to hire people who are at the top of their field as your first employees, if they are not totally risk averse.

Let's see, to pull my canned refs from my melatonin article (<a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Melatonin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Melatonin</a>); we have Stampi in _Why We Nap_:<p>>     It is worth mentioning that anthropological studies conducted in tribes active at night show that human sleep can be highly polyphasic in certain cultures. Although they have different cultures and ways of life, both the Temiars of Indonesia and the Ibans of Sarawak have similar polyphasic sleep-wake behaviors (Petre-Quadens, 1983). Their average nocturnal sleep episode duration ranges between 4 and 6 hr, and nighttime activities (fishing, cooking, watching over the fire, rituals) at any one time involve approximately 25% of the adult members. Daytime napping is very common in both tribes: at almost any time of day, about 10% of the adult members are asleep. Whatever the cause of these polyphasic sleep patterns,whether the expression of an inborn ultradian rest-activity tendency or other factors, such populations exhibit extremely flexible and fragmentary sleep-wake cycles. The minimal contact with modern civilization could be one of the reasons for the preservation of this possibly ancestral sleep pattern.<p>There's <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/10/what_is_a_natural_sleep_patter.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/10/what_is_a_natural_slee...</a><p>And then, for all the European examples, see <a href=""http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/106.2/ah000343.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/106.2/ah00034...</a> The author apparently has a book on the same topic which I really ought to read, but the preceding is the article mentioned on his profile-page:<p>> _At Days Close: Night in Times Past_ (W.W.

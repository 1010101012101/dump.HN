The basic fact is that when people encounter a bug, they&#x27;re likely to complain about it, but when things are working smoothly, they&#x27;re not likely to think &quot;Oh, I should tell the developers about this&quot;.  In fact, when I imagine writing positive feedback, I realize that some of the ways that come to mind are &quot;Yesss, thank god, that stupid behavior from the past is finally fixed&quot;, or possibly &quot;Oh man this is so much better than [other browser] which has xyz problems&quot;; each of those would probably have created at least as much negative feedback in the past, likely more.[1]<p>The consequence is that, regardless of how good a browser is, negative reports seem likely to substantially outnumber positive reports, and so I think the feedback has always been &quot;[majority]% sad&quot;.  (It has certainly spiked recently, though.)  I&#x27;m somewhat curious what the designers think of it; I guess it looks like it&#x27;s just one statistic out of many that they display.<p>[1] In the case of &quot;OMG Firefox is awesome compared to browser Y which sucks in xyz case&quot;, it&#x27;s true that the negative feedback would be directed towards browser Y and not Firefox; but if Firefox and browser Y are roughly competitive, then there are probably just as many &quot;Gah Firefox sucks compared to browser Y which handles xyz just fine&quot; cases, so the counting argument basically stands.",1396735184

I get that idea if you rely on SEO and you have risky tactics, but in RetailMeNot&#x27;s case, they have the best user experience and also, up to date coupons and for that reason are the best result most of the time in the vertical.<p>If this was a publicly traded company that bought links and had a site with a shoddy user experience, I&#x27;d get the argument that there&#x27;s significant risk.<p>In the history of Google there are very few, if any case studies of sites that A) did the right thing B) were the best result that ended up losing significant traffic. Most of it is &quot;yeah, we were doing this wrong, but it&#x27;s still not fair..&quot;. In Rap Genius&#x27; case, they clearly did something wrong.<p>The only exception to this rule is if Google moves in on the vertical and steals traffic, which is possible with coupons - but there&#x27;s a significant difference between completely destroying a vertical and impeding on it somewhat. Google has moved in on the airline tickets vertical but the businesses there are still doing just fine (Expedia, Priceline), as shown by their considerable growth in the last year+. It seems likely that if Google moved in on this vertical, it would be a similar impact.<p>In this article, there&#x27;s little to describe what RetailMeNot does wrong. Yes, they are somewhat of a parasite, but in many ways they do these businesses a service by lowering purchase friction by creating an elegant experience for users. If their UX was substandard, it&#x27;s possible customers would get lost and never complete their purchase - this happens time and time again, which is why CRO professionals can get hundreds of thousands of dollars to optimize a conversion funnel. In many ways, RetailMeNot is a piece of that elegant conversion funnel, so they are rewarded as an extremely profitable affiliate for that reason.<p>Disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t taken the time to evaluate their link profile so there&#x27;s a possibility that they are doing something risky there, but from an on-page perspective, they are the best result.",1396733032

Looks good, possibly faster than Octane judging by the video, but it&#x27;s impossible to know what they are running it on.<p>I&#x27;m very hopeful that incremental improvements to path tracing algorithms over the next couple of years will reduce the amount of noise in real-time, as the render quality is amazing. However even on a high end machine, with a complex scene you end up with a lot of black areas, which makes everything look darker. LuxRender partially solves this by rendering over the top of the last frame by default, but that sometimes creates some nasty ghosting effects that can be worse than always painting over black like Octane does.<p>If you want to try this stuff out there&#x27;s a free demo version of Octane you can download and LuxRender is entirely free. However Octane requires a CUDA card with a fair bit of VRAM as it does everything in GPU and the size of the scene is limited by the amount of VRAM you have.<p>LuxRender is currently only stable in CPU-only mode and doesn&#x27;t come with any UI to speak of; it&#x27;s more of a rendering toolkit. You can&#x27;t just open it up and move a scene around in real-time. You can do that with Octane though and I thoroughly recommend giving it a try.<p>There seem to be a fairly significant diminishing returns over rendering time with path tracing, so the results you get in real-time will probably be about the same on a wide variety of cards, i.e., full of noise and black areas, but still impressive. The difference between a render running for 4 hours vs one running for 8 hours is far less significant than the difference between 10 seconds compared to a minute.<p>Edit: I just noticed that Brigade is from Otoy, who own Octane Render. The site&#x27;s not particularly clear about it, but it looks like this is their cloud-based render farm solution based on Octane. There&#x27;s an earlier video somewhere showing real-time movie-quality rendering over something like 144 GPUs (instead of the 2-4 in this video). However the cost for renting that much GPU power was pretty astronomical.",1396733012

We are still stuck in old ideas  of messaging app, photo sharing app, maps and news aggregators. I believe all those apps could have been conceived back in 2007.

High-level programming offers the prospect of a quick start, but, especially with today&#x27;s web frameworks, you tend to rapidly find yourself bogged down in dealing with magic that&#x27;s baked into the platform and which nobody really bothered documenting very well because &quot;it just works&quot; -- which is fine, except when it doesn&#x27;t, and you get to spend time working on your tools, instead of the problem you&#x27;re using them to solve. I don&#x27;t want to RAILS name any names here RAILS, but RAILS I&#x27;m sure every RAILS web developer has RAILS at least RAILS some RAILS inkling of RAILS what I&#x27;m RAILS talking RAILS about RAILS here RAILS RAILS RAILS.<p>My observation of the programmers with whom I&#x27;ve worked, and whom I know socially, has been that a given hacker&#x27;s degree of intelligence and capability tends to be inversely proportional to the thickness of the stack on which he chooses to base his efforts; the smartest person I know, who has multiple doctorates and is currently busy breaking new ground in bioinformatics, doesn&#x27;t even use <i>libraries</i> if he can help it, and complains constantly about the frustrating misbehaviors of those which turn out to be irreducibly necessary. Perhaps I&#x27;ve merely been observing a constellation of coincidence, but on the whole I rather doubt it.<p>(P.S. for the benefit of anyone who feels like I&#x27;ve just called him stupid: my last gig was a Rails job, and if you took all the programmers I&#x27;ve ever known and broke their smarts up into quintiles, I&#x27;d be somewhere in the upper second, <i>maybe</i> the lower third. It doesn&#x27;t take genius to recognize genius at work; I&#x27;ve merely been uncommonly fortunate, for the most part, in my choice of friends and colleagues.)<p>(P.P.S. for general use: Speaking of recognizing genius at work, it scintillates in every jot and tittle of the article here under discussion.)",1396731704

I would have thought that one could solve such things exactly by representing each unique known irrational that arises (root 2, pi, etc) by its own rational multiplier, and then overloading the relevant equality checks. Of course, you&#x27;d need to anticipate/implement each irrational type that might arise (roots, the geometric transcendental pi, and so on.)<p>[Leaving the next sentence in, for comedy value. I typed it and then realised how ridiculous it is - apologies!]<p>Essentially it&#x27;s just teaching the computer to do the algebra for you, isn&#x27;t it?",1396731628

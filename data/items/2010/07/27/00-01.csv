See, I don't think Google (the search engine whose opinion's most influence my thoughts -- no offense DDG) sees content farms as a bad thing.<p>If someone is searching for ""how to make a blueberry pie"", and they get an article entitled ""how to make a blueberry pie"", they're happy.  Are they actually going to make a blueberry pie?  <i>Probably not</i>.  Therefore, it doesn't really matter whether they get a good blueberry pie recipe or a bad blueberry pie recipe.  As long as they quickly get to a well-designed page <i>that they won't read anyhow because no one reads on the Internet</i> which has a few bullet points they'll skim fast and a blueberry pie picture on it, they're happy.  Their blueberry pie voyeurism need is fulfilled.<p>Content mills make that happen, for huge segments of the population.  Let me strip that of euphemism: content mills make this happen for women, the elderly, and the technically disinclined.  Absent the content mill, there is insufficient ""organically produced"" content on the things they care about on the Internet because their participation on the Internet is dramatically less than y'alls participation is and y'all -- speaking in generalities -- do not blog about good blueberry pie recipes.<p>You can think of content mills as an organism in symbiosis with Google: how to you juice relevance algorithms to identify the sliver of a sliver of a fraction of the Internet which talks about blueberry pies and other things your mom cares about, identify the best tangentially related article, and present it to her every time?  Well, you could have your crack teams of geniuses work on it for a few years, even though your favorite tricks like PageRank are likely to function less well because there's less linking data to go around.  Or, in the alternative, you could encourage content farming.<p>It surely has not escape Google's notice that their bottom line revenue increases by about 80% of the top-line revenue of the entire content farming industry, incidentally.  Contextual ads are the perfect monetization vehicle for laser-targeted content produced at quality which will be solely viewed in search mode, and Google <i>owns</i> that entire field.",1280192100

So lets agree that doing Marijuana may not 100% of the time lead to cocaine use. That doesn't mean that it doens't increases the likelyhood of using it because you've already broken multiple moral values that go beyond just drinking or smoking.<p>Another example: Does smoking mean that you are going to get cancer? No. But it has been proven in plenty of studies that it does increases your chances of getting cancer. And I think we can agree that using Marijuana is a step closer to using cocaine than just drinking alcohol. For once, if you are using Marijuana that means that you already have a person providing you an illegal substance. That same person can probably get you cocaine and anything else you want. If you only drink alcohol you would still have to find this illegal substance distributor.<p>Finally, are you making the claim that there is nothing wrong with smoking Marijuana.

It's just not visible because we don't manufacture much in the way of consumer products. But there are many, many companies building and selling stuff. I'd say that most of the businesses in the industrial park where I work are small and medium manufacturers. I happen to work for a very large manufacturer, but you'd never know it to look at our building: looks like any other office building except for the semis at the loading dock.",1280189104

They're not particularly savvy on technology, just the average Facebook user.<p>We realized that as a personality typing application we have a very good platform for surveying any sort of opinion.  Our user base is fairly reflective of the general US population, and none of them are coming to answer a survey about x.

Between Command & Conquer (over peer-to-peer dial-up!), Quake Team Fortress, Civilization II, and a few others, I was playing 30-40 hours of PC games per week.<p>I eventually grew out of the habit, and now don't find PC or console games appealing anymore. The fact that I naturally gave it up without any intervention means it wasn't an addiction.<p>Most other computer enthusiasts that I know or work with have a similar story of ""growing out of"" their addiction to computer games. I imagine many on HN have similar stories to tell.<p>I think the examples in PG's essay are ""phases"", not addictions.<p>And I predict that most of the people PG knows who self-identify as Internet addicts will eventually out-grow their compulsion.",1280188915
1549757,comment,1549363,1549730,0,0,fmora,,,"You start with an illegal substance. You are already breaking the law so what is the big deal with using an even stronger substance. That seems to be the rationale used by a lot of people. I guess I should have made that clear in my original example. Believe it or not your moral values start to decrease once you start breaking them. I'll take it to another extreme: Once a criminal has become used to breaking the law, doing one more crime doesn't seem like a big deal to them.<p>Many people will not switch from cigarettes to Marijuana because their moral values does not allow them to. i.e. They see using an illegal substance as immoral. However, if somehow you convince them to use Marijuana and break their moral value what many of them will do is to rationalize that  using Marijuana is no big deal. Especially if a lot of peers are re-inforcing that notion (as many are trying to do here in Hacker News. Or to put it another way, a rotten apple will rotten all the others). That moral value is lost. Since there is no longer a moral value stopping them from using illegal substances using Cocaine is really no big deal anymore.<p>I hypothesize that this is how criminals are created in general. The first time the commit a crime they may be really nervous, eventually they get used to it and many may go on to commit worse crimes. I guess this is why it is so important to teach kids strong moral values. Also to keep them away from bad influences. They are the most vulnerable in their teenage years from breaking their moral values. If they have not broken their moral values after their mid twenties they are probably not going to anymore.",1280188894

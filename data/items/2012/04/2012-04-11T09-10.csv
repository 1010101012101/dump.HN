Some people just want to know how things work under the hood.<p>I can remember starting to program our brand new PET-2001 in BASIC (at 13 years old or so). After a while I became bored with the sluggishness of BASIC, and the cramped memory space. Only very small BASIC programs would fit.  But there was a new challenge! I wanted to discover what made the PET really tick -- how did it understand BASIC?  Then I learnt about ROMs, RAMs and the 6502 CPU, and how to program it in machine language.  It was similar to programming programmable calculators, which I'd done since I was 9. But the 6502 worked much more faster, and had a rich instruction set, compared to those old calculators; and a much better screen, with graphics!<p>Since I was a kid, I always wanted to look into the inside of toys how they worked, for example, my 'Brummkreisel'[1] spintop. At 6, I wanted to open my hamster to look inside, but my mother wouldn't allow it...

Mike left AOL because Arriana was getting too hands on. There were a lot of little control decisions that lead to the decision to leave.<p>He left and <i>then</i> setup Crunchfund, with an investment from AOL. He was supposed to continue as a contributor, just like many other contributors who are also investors or entrepreneurs but declined on that as well. MG remained as a contributor.<p>As for the circle jerk being boring, I couldn't agree more (and I know the people involved, most of them well). What you have to keep in mind is that when something is made public, there is a motive for that. There is a reason why readers are being informed, and it usually isn't a good reason (for eg. claiming 'in view of full disclosure' and then telling half the story and leaving comments closed).<p>But if you are going to call out the circle-jerk and how boring it is, first make your story accurate (not difficult, all the details are spread out across the various blogs) and second at least back-up the claim that people are starting to tire of it, for eg. the fact that only one other blog wrote about the latest bust-up, or that it only rated a mention on twitter amongst other bloggers who joked about it.<p>The 'dirty laundry' posts used to be a lot more popular than they are now, and that means they are having little effect to their purpose of riling up readers. It would have taken a single paragraph to lay that point out, this just reads like somebody who jumped right into the circle jerk and is riding coat tails.

Last update brought iPad3 support, new airplanes and bug fixes. Next one will bring 2 additional aircrafts, missions, better map, IFR Fixes/Airways...<p>Now, for the things that the HN crowd might be interested in:<p>- It's entirely in C#. Codebase of the simulator itself (excluding XNA, MonoGame) is 99% shared between WP7 and iOS.<p>- The user base on iOS is <i>much</i> larger than on WP7, the numbers go far beyond our wildest expectations. (It's a bit early to tell, but something like 30x to 45x what we had on Windows Phone so far)<p>- The physics engine is custom, we're using rigid body simulation and apply forces based on angle of attack, airspeed, lift tables...<p>- Using MonoGame/MonoTouch has been incredible, the guys at Xamarin are great!<p>- We did run into issues with Garbage Collection, but nothing that we couldn't solve with a classic optimization session at the end<p>- People seem to love the fact that we setup a uservoice site. (http://feedback.flyingdevstudio.com). We've got tons of suggestions and we'll <i>try</i> to implement what people want first.<p>Some videos/pics:

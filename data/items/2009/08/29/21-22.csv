Refactoring helpers are wonderful.  They make it so much easier to change the name of something when its meaning changes so that the code stays clean.  Like many visual editors (rather than command line things like vim), it can do tabs and show a tree of files on the left pane.  It supports a lot of different languages and even has some great hooks for running a project on your local machine.  It can also detect some problems - unused variables, unused imports, syntax problems, etc. which means that you can catch small errors fast.<p>It does have its faults (like any piece of software), but it can be very helpful.",1251583198

793667,comment,793010,793166,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It was some time after I became seriously interested in photography that I realized framing is a myth. Bad or amateur photographers look at a poorly framed result and regretfully discard it. Experienced ones cut triangles off the sides - or nowadays, straighten it up in Photoshop or Picasa. If you enjoy photography you might find it well worth revisiting your discard box.<p>The myth persists partly because in film and video, the frame is a much harder limit and requires a far greater commitment on the part of the person looking through the lens at the time the image is recorded...we do mess about with it in post-production, of course, but with far less freedom than a still photographer enjoys.<p>Don't be too harsh on the absence of the artistic 'spark'. Even magnificent artists like Durer employed grids to aid with proportion and perspective, and composed complex pictures by making numerous studies of posed models first. Much historical art would have been viewed as a matter of skill rather than talent by its creators, with the art stemming from the selective emphasis rather than a faithful rendering.<p>I agree with you about the ketchup bottles though. The body of work on display here seems singularly unadventurous in its choice of subject matter.",1251582816

You have a few central people who are helping a ton of people organize meetups. This lets those at the center get great reach, and makes the global event really big. It is amazing that a global event is essentially organized by a handful of people.<p>Like the internet, this kind of decentralization requires relinquishing a bit of control.

793654,comment,793619,793619,0,0,grandalf,,,"I'd suggest just making a list of 10 potential clients... then research the organizations a bit and contact them and ask for a few minutes to present what you've done.<p>The key is to realize what you are selling.  In the first 30 seconds of a phone conversation you're selling them on the idea that you are professional and that they should actually not hang up the phone...<p>The next step is to mention your product and to get them talking about their needs.  Ideally they tell you a bunch of needs that your product perfectly addresses.<p>From there, you have to worry about logistics, such as who is actually going to make the purchase decision, etc.  You should be prepared to work with their organization and process and to do as many phone calls and online demos as needed to get everyone comfortable with the product.   Also realize that their purchase timeframe might not be immediate.<p>The main skill that professional salespeople have is the ability to efficiently get people to commit to a purchase.  One develops a sixth sense for when to ask for the signed contract, etc.  But with any new product, even a seasoned salesperson is going to have to do some learning about the typical customer, the product, etc.<p>I think the best thing to do is just ask ""so what's the best way for us to proceed?"" to your most trusted contact in the organization, and let them tell you how to sell to them.<p>If it's a high priced product, be prepared to have an in-person meeting before someone will write you a big check.  Once you have signed a few clients then it may be possible to sign people over the phone.<p>The hardest sales are the first few, but it sounds like you already have some happy clients, so you should probably contact them and ask if they might feel comfortable talking to your potential future clients about the product, etc.<p>Also, be prepared that some may say ""hey, we paid you to develop this and now you're selling our product to others?"".  You might want to offer them something in return (such as free upgrades) and discuss this with them up front to avoid any confusion, etc.",1251582184

793619,story,,,49,17,consultant,"Ask HN: How do I sell my expensive niche software w/ no sales background?",,"A little over 2 years ago, I quit my full-time job and began freelancing. The vast majority of my work has come from one particular group of customers at a University. I've been paid 10-20k dollars on 3 separate occasions to develop a web application for this niche, I have another customer who will be paying me a similar amount in the fall when I work with him, and there is another customer who wants something similar but doesn't have the funds yet.<p>This niche is academic in nature and as far as I know the money comes from grants. I have never signed any paperwork, I have simply built what they wanted and been paid. I have a great relationship with these customers and have already discussed the fact that I might try to sell a product like this to other institutions, which they are fine with. I am confident that I can extract some core components that are useful in this niche, rewrite the app (there are things I want to improve), and create a product that would be useful to other similar institutions. However, I don't actually have many connections in other cities yet, nor do I have any experience in selling a piece of already-developed software for tens of thousands of dollars to people I don't know. All of my business has come through referrals. What I _have_ done is spent a few years talking to the customers, answering emails of the users of the app, developed several different versions of it, and been able to successfully charge money by the hour for development. So I feel like if I only connect a few more dots, there is a great business here. So now I'm trying to decide where to go with this, and could use some help.<p>So I have a few questions:<p>1) If a piece of software would cost tens of thousands of dollars to develop from scratch (possibly more when considering the development has required the time of many highly paid individuals), would it be reasonable to charge someone five figures for a packaged solution, and also charge a high consulting rate for customizations and integration with the customer's data? Note that this software isn't being sold to mom and dad or your friends, it's being sold to large, state and federal funded organizations, and there aren't many solutions out there.<p>2) How does one go about learning to sell? Especially a software product that is expensive, but probably wouldn't sell that many copies, maybe a thousand copies. Any books you recommend? Do I just find the proper contact at the institution and call them up? Tell them about what I have and show them a demo? Do I need to get a sales guy? Do I need to fly all over the country and show the software in person? Would someone be willing to buy an expensive piece of software based on a screencast and examples of a couple of other customers that use it?<p>So there you have it. I'm trying to make the transition from consulting to selling a product, have a couple years living expenses in the bank, and have someone willing to pay me while I work on it for the next few months. But now I just need to figure out where to go next. Obviously I will sell the first copy to the client I am planning to do work for in the Fall. But what should the next step be? My first thought would be to just start cold calling potential customers, which I have never done. Any help you can offer would be appreciated.",1251579785

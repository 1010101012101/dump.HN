Let an expert guide you through a series of perspectives. But completing them often takes more dedication than most busy people can muster.<p>By breaking courses down to a more granular level of components, there is a huge chance to recognize people for the pieces they are able to complete and let them string those together in new ways that the traditional course designers hadn&#x27;t thought of. But there are huge challenges around figuring out how different modules could be fit together into new ways. For instance, the Open Educational Resource repositories have had really slow adoption because of it, even though they have in total a ton of great educational content (and quantities of chaff).<p>I wrote a little bit more about this today, and how digital badges could help a provider like edX crowdsource good organization of many distributed modules. <a href=""http://remediatingassessment.blogspot.com/2014/08/mit-report-questions-fitness-of-course-metaphor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://remediatingassessment.blogspot.com/2014/08/mit-report...</a><p>I think it&#x27;s really all about switching to a different metaphor for organizing content and examining the entailments of that metaphor to make sure their internal logic leads you to the values you want to promote.",1407390329

8146407,comment,8145812,8145812,9,0,incision,,,"><i>&#x27;The report also suggests that MIT consider offering different levels of certification through its online-learning ventures, MITx and edX, and recommends that the Institute redouble its commitment to access and affordability — possibly by increasing MIT’s undergraduate population, which has remained stable for decades despite increasing demand, or by providing flexibility to allow students to complete a traditional undergraduate degree in less than four years.&#x27;</i><p>Personally, I&#x27;d hope to see &#x27;differing levels of certification&#x27; expanded to the point of offering credit courses for distance learning. Go ahead and differentiate it further from the residential brand than MITx if necessary.<p>I&#x27;ve watched hours and hours of OCW, and completed several courses on MITx with a handful more scheduled for the fall. As a rule, these courses are far more challenging and just plain better than what I pay quite a bit to my state University for.<p>I would jump at the opportunity to pay MIT many multiples more than the pittance they charge for ID Verified courses on EdX in order to take MIT born credit courses.<p><i>>&#x27;The report recommends that MIT explore more modular approaches to teaching — both online and on-campus. Data from the first 17 MITx and HarvardX courses indicate that only about 5 percent of registrants earn a certificate of completion. This and other edX data, the report says, suggest that “students are focused more on learning certain elements of a class and less on completing what has traditionally been considered a module or unit of learning.”&#x27;</i><p>I can&#x27;t say I agree with drawing or even supporting that conclusion from the poor completion rates. I think the overall completion rates are effectively meaningless - signing up is trivial and instant.<p>I did some crunching of the older stats EdX released a while back and from my foggy recollection even the tiniest measures of intent correlate with dramatically higher completion.<p>More modular courses aren&#x27;t going to help the 35% of people who sign up but never even look at the courseware - it&#x27;s already modular for all they know.<p><i>>&#x27;These edX results are in keeping with surveys of MIT’s own faculty and students: In a 2013 survey, 25 percent of MIT faculty, and 40 percent of MIT students, indicated that some of the Institute’s course offerings might benefit from being broken up into smaller modules.&#x27;</i><p><i>>&#x27;The unbundling of classes also reflects a larger trend in society — a number of other media offerings have become available in modules, whether it is a song from an album, an article from a newspaper, or a chapter from a textbook.”&#x27;</i><p>I can&#x27;t say I agree with the idea of &#x27;unbundling&#x27; courses much at all.<p>Personally, getting a &#x27;holistic&#x27; understanding of the subject is precisely why I&#x27;m pursuing a degree and why I chose to work through books or MOOC courses as opposed browsing tutorials or StackOverflow posts as-needed.<p>I didn&#x27;t always feel this way. I self taught myself into a career well above my apparent station in life and felt supremely confident that I could go on picking and choosing, learning whatever I needed to know next.<p>Eventually, I realized that the gaps in what I knew did just hold missing facts or techniques, they constituted missing questions too. Things I didn&#x27;t even know to ask.<p>That&#x27;s the value of a &#x27;complete&#x27; course and education - the foundation and supporting framework that ensures you can always keep building.<p>Interestingly, the median age of people taking courses on EdX is 23-30 and the median age of on-campus students is surely below that. I didn&#x27;t reach the above epiphany until I was 28 or 29, well into a respectable tower of a career.<p>It would not surprise me if the people who might think they want for $0.99 singles of education are following the same course.",1407389939

Why was USV left off of the chart when it was in earlier charts? If founders don&#x27;t care much about mentorship (see chart on page four) why are they bothering to include this chart?

But where US law doesn&#x27;t allow for copyright to be assigned to non-humans, bringing an additional human agent into the scenario creates a hypothetical that is non-analogous and therefore unnecessarily confusing.<p>I think that a closer analogy would be if you were to set up a motion-activated camera trap in the park to take pictures of the local wildlife.  In that case it would be fairly uncontroversial to say that you would get copyright to the pictures.  Compared to that hypothetical, I think that as far as US law is concerned it could well be the case that the fact that for this photograph the action the monkey took to trigger the camera shutter involved actually coming into contact with the shutter release button is ultimately a distinction without a difference.",1407388260

How that could be accomplished is also worth considering - there is a school of thought that suggests taking control away from the users and disallowing them from doing anything that some entity (corporate or government) does not approve of on the assumption that users will always make mistakes (e.g. Trusted Computing), but this also means loss of freedom - as the saying goes, &quot;freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.&quot;<p>However, if on the other hand we allow the users freedom, and thus assume that mistakes (such as being infected with malware like this) will happen, then it makes sense that a means of recovery should be available, which is not something that &quot;perfect&quot; security allows. To use an analogy, people who have lost their keys or had them stolen should still be able to gain access to their house. In the physical world, perfect security is nearly impossible, but with digital data, it&#x27;s not. Locking an item in a safe means it can still be retrieved if the key is lost by, in the worst possible circumstance, cutting open the safe, no matter how physically strong it is. Encrypting data with a long-enough key and sufficiently strong algorithm means it&#x27;s truly practically <i>destroyed</i> without the key. I think this point - that encryption can be really, really, <i>really</i> unrecoverably strong - needs to be made more aware as we continue to use more of it.<p>It would be particularly ironic if this recovery was made possible through exploiting the malware servers with something like Heartbleed...",1407387956

Point is, only one ever really comes out, because the vendors don&#x27;t want to support two independent binaries, and in practice games really have no excuse to use more than 4GB of ram - you really should be caching to disk any scene or environment data that is that large, and all your texture data is already resident on the GPU. GPU drivers would have to be PAE aware, though, if you wanted to address more than 4GB of video memory (such as on the Titan).<p>And all the media creation tools do fall under that &quot;business class use case&quot;. It is not that I think 64 bit is stupid - if you need 64 bit addressing, you need 64 bit addressing - just that the average consumer did not need it, at all. Business applications that needed 64 bit could have been shipped as such, hopefully for Itanium (read some docs on it, the ASM and pipeline model were way ahead of their time - to its detriment, sadly) which could have been the Xeon-esque business CPUs.",1407387747

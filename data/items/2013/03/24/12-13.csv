You also really need to pay attention if the project you're being asked to do matches up with what the lab/group you'll be in can do.<p>A PhD is taking effectively a massive paycut for nebulous future earnings potential, not to mention is asking a lot of your enthusiasm and creativity for a long duration.",1364129999

He lost that game, and he only told me a long time later that he was offered that choice.<p>I think this is one reason why VCs want young entrepeneurs, because VCs need people who think that they get many more opportunities to cross that line in case the current startup tanks.

Granted that many Android apps are free, but that's only one part. Most users would hate to give up the apps they are used to having and the data they have stored in them as well. Users already mull it over when they switch between iOS and Android (or vice versa). Committing to Tizen or anything else is for many users, too high of a risk with the costs of the hardware and also the time to set it up and find app alternatives.",1364129748
5431918,comment,5431842,5431874,10,0,RyanZAG,,,"Replying to my own comment...<p>Regarding Touchwizz and Android app compatibility - without the core Google services (maps, play, etc), many popular Android apps will not run. The differences in the underlying platform is also likely to cause many errors and incompatibilities on non-modified Android apps run on Tizen. This means more app crashes and more uncertainty.<p>In any event, full Android app compatibility and Android apps as first class apps means that Tizen basically is Android in any case - it will have to have Dalvik, Linux ARM compatibility, identical OpenGL interfaces, identical Linux interfaces, etc. Seeing as Android is Apache licensed anyway, I'm having difficulty in seeing the point? Why not just take Android, create a fork, and rename it to Tizen? I don't see any benefits in re-inventing a platform that will just mimic Android (and have all the same limitations to keep compatibility).<p>Legal issues - I can't see any legal difference in forking Apache licensed code and renaming vs starting from scratch.<p>Usability - both Samsung Android devices and Tizen devices will have the same Touchwizz UI. Far as I can tell, Samsung is actually aiming for identical usability here.<p>Compatibility - all of the Google Maps based Apps won't work. Users won't get the great gmail/gtalk/google now integration that they can on Android. No free best-of-breed navigation. No Google Play - users will have to rely on devs uploading their app to Samsung store along with Google Play. Seems like a big point against Tizen here.<p>Control (for Samsung) - Samsung can already add/remove whatever they want to Android. I'm guessing Google puts certain demands on Samsung to use the Android name and Google apps, but Samsung can just use a different name and no Google apps. In Tizen they're going to have to do this anyway.<p>The more I look into this, the stranger it becomes. I can't work out what Samsung is trying to accomplish here. This smells like a project they inherited with Intel with the likely purpose being rivalry with Nokia and perhaps internal politics. Maybe some misunderstanding of how much freedom they actually have with Apache licensed Android?",1364129661

No unified governance.<p>HTML5 is an unproven, and some would say disproven, mobile app platform. Browsers, compilers, SDKs, and frameworks are immature. There are no success stories despite several tries.<p>Samsung, and its likely carrier partners, have no ecosystem comparable to Apple's or Google's. The only 3rd party ecosystem success story is Amazon with the Android-derived Kindle Fire.<p>I believe it is possible to compete with Apple and Google, but Tizen is not close to being able, as it is today. At this point Tizen is well behind Windows Phone, Blackberry, Sailfish, B2G, and even Ubuntu in being ready to compete.<p>Having a decades-long duopoly will be boring in many ways, so I hope somebody gets their act together.

Although really it's only a handful of apps ""real"" people actually care about (Think Gmail, Twitter, Angry Birds etc...).

I see Google with Motorola, moving even more so into hardware and pushing their ""pure"" Android Nexus brand more and more.

But now they're too much of a threat to Android, like the article, potentially moving to a different OS that could further fragment the market.<p>I think mainly Samsung will wait a see how Windows Phone goes, to see if they change OS.

While Apple and Google make it appear easy to create an OS that users enjoy using, the reality is that it is incredibly difficult.<p>Just look at Windows Phone - I'm fairly sure that Microsoft is more able to create a technically superior OS to Samsung, and I think the amount of money Microsoft has poured into Windows Phone advertising shows the amount of marketing talent that is likely being used. Yet Windows Phone is a dismal failure even with Nokia's huge manufacturing bulk behind it. The only sensible conclusion I can come to is that making a desirable mobile OS is far more difficult than it appears, and that there are numerous 'below the water line' effects that make a mobile OS popular.<p>I very much doubt that Samsung is going to be able to transition the bulk of their Android users to Tizen.

My kids grew up on 80 acres with a shop, gocart, 100's of trees to climb, an old barn, and dozens of hobbies. Their friends flocked to our place after school and weekends. The closets and shed are crowded with old projects, picces of trebuchets, model rockets, parts of suits of armor, portable forts made of plywood for airsoft wars, even a 7-foot 'siege cow' made of PVC, foam, a pillow and a rubber glove (the udder).<p>And this place cost very little compared to the insanity of CA real estate.

Honest question.<p>I've read a bunch of articles (that I cannot look up right now) that argue that this decrease in safety is mostly perception, and I'm inclined to agree.<p>I grew up in the 'ghetto' of my hometown, and then from 8 tot 17 I lived in what was considered a dangerous, third-world country. Still, my parents mostly raised me as any kid in earlier times: be home before dark, don't go too far, but do whatever you want the rest of the time outside of school.<p>By and large, my experience has not been too different from other kids I know in safer environments, and I've had few 'scary' experiences involving other people. Most 'dangers' involved general kids-being-stupid things: crossing streets without looking, or climbing things at the risk of falling down on the pavement head-first, egging each other on to do something stupid, etc.<p>My point is, I can't really see the danger, and would like to know what you consider 'lacking'. Kidnapping is rare, sexual harassment is vastly more common in family circles, playgrounds have mostly become safer (and less fun, IMO), and violence of any kind by adults to children is (I think) relatively uncommon too. Even in dangerous areas.<p>Of course, I am no parent. And I admit I present no actual supporting evidence (right now) other than my own experience. But I'm not really trying to prove something, just interested in your take on this. Maybe I'm missing something important that I would be aware of with some context, or with the experience of being a parent",1364127483
5431836,comment,5431561,5431561,3,0,hugofirth,,,"I am currently building a prototype game based upon Maze generation and pathfinding for my 3rd Year project at University.<p>You can play the prototype at <a href=""http://mazeapp.heroku.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mazeapp.heroku.com</a><p>I've found Maze generation algorithms to be fascinatingly diverse in their approach to the problem, and the types of mazes they generate.<p>The problem itself can broadly be classified as a Random Tree Generation and Traversal.<p>Aside from the typical Kruskals/Primms approach, a selection of the Algorithms that you can use for Generation are:<p>Recursive Backtracker. This is a nice simple algorithm that generates mazes without many short 'dead end' passages. It appears to be the approach taken by the author. One issue with Recursive Backtracker mazes is that they are slightly easier for Humans to solve from an over the shoulder or first person perspective, as there aren't many dead ends. Furthermore, because the algorithm is recursive rather than iterative, complex (large) mazes tend to cause stack overflow errors.<p>Growing Tree. My favourite algorithm for maze generation (for academic purposes). It functions in a similar manner to the recursive backtracker algorithm however when it comes to  explore a new cell you can choose either to explore the newest cell, or one at random. The more often you choose the newest cell - the more the maze will look like a maze generated by recursive backtracker (because in this case the process is essentially exactly the same). The more often you choose a random cell, the more short dead ends paths you wil have. This balance allows for some dynamic weighting function and some interesting results. Plus it generates mazes that are fun to solve and nice to look at.<p>Eller's Algorithm. This is an algorithm I discovered by accident in an article written by Jamis Buck (<a href=""http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/29/maze-generation-eller-s-algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/29/maze-generation-eller...</a> - incidentally he has a fantastic series on maze generation algorithms with a lot of hypnotic in browser demos... check them out!). It is interesting because it allows you to generate mazes of infinite depth in linear time and low memory. Mazes must have a set width or height but can otherwise continue forever whilst continuing to be technically perfect mazes (single acyclic paths to goal).<p>----<p>As a last aside its also worth mentioning that although they're not <i>technically</i> mazes - mazes with loops in are more challenging. Loops can conceptually be added by adding edges at random to your randomly generated tree.<p>----<p>From a pathfinding perspective simple A* is indeed guaranteed to give you an optimal solution if one exists - however its not terribly interesting as it requires full world knowledge ahead of time - you can't compete with an A* agent in a Maze haha.<p>What I have done for the agent implementation in my example (the shadow) is a dynamically weighted variant of A* pathfinding. Essentially you introduce a pessimistic error into your A* heuristic which depends on the value of that heuristic. Analogously - the further you are from an object the world the less accurately you can estimate its distrance from you. From that point I stop and rerun A* each time the agent moves 10 cells from the position where is last ran A*. This gives the agent the appearance of heading in the general direction of the goal whilst still having the ability to take wrong turns etc...<p>----<p>That was a great opportunity to geek out :)",1364127442

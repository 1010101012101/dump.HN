102379,comment,102254,102331,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I agree with dcurtis.  You can donate money instead of volunteering.  If anything, donating an hour's wages is harder than donating an hour's worth of volunteering (assuming your job is not as pleasant as volunteering, which by and large seems to be the case).  You might make $20 an hour after adjusting for everything (this gets distorted because of tax deductions and the like), but people have to pay you to do it.  You take more pain.  While volunteering, you take less pain.  Giving an hour of wages might be equivalent to giving two hours of volunteer time (in terms of opportunity cost).  If one creates more wealth for the charity than the other, you should do more of that.  It might not make sense to volunteer.",1201031739

Long story short, he worked for the Bank of Canada doing basically what your Federal Reserve chairman does.<p>The amount of analysis and study that goes into interest rate adjustment is mind blowing.

The federal funds rate controls indirectly the inflation so if you had them very high (which hurts the economy a lot but you have to do it if you want to lower the inflation) of course you can lower it back to normal (around 5%) when inflation is back to normal (around 2%). But lowering it below the normal rate increases exponentially the yearly inflation gain because banks borrow from the FED and using fractional-reserve banking they flood the market with new money, lowering the value of the dollar. Meaning that ""typically a person's most valuable asset (home)"" increases in price, and decreases in value. The purchasing power of the people goes down, together with the GDP. The dollars becomes internationally unattractive (I'm looking at China's Reserve Bank for example, or just having dollars) as its annual inflation rate makes any saving to lose value. One dollar will buy $1 worth of goods and services this year, but only 95c the next year with an inflation at 5%; this has the same effect as a 5% annual tax on cash holdings.",1201029720

I was talking with a trader friend of mine last fall about the real estate collapse that was just getting underway (finally -- that's an event my coworkers and I had seen coming for at least a couple of years), and we both agreed without equivocation that there was going to be a recession this year.  Knowing that in advance doesn't automatically give you knowledge of a profitable series of trades to make.

Take the HGST Deskstar and Ultrastar, or Seagate Constellation ES and Barracuda 2 TB; they are physically exactly the same, but behave very differently when encountering an error. Basically the enterprise drive will fail shortly BUT recover (because it's probably RAID-backed), while the desktop drive will try to read the data when asked at all prices (because it's probably NOT RAID-backed), therefore suffering from extremely long time-outs.<p>> <i>. The probability of zero errors after reading 3E13 bits is ((1E14-1)/1E14)^3E13, which is about 75%.</i><p>Still not the sort of statistics you want betting your precious data against...",1347105475

4492789,comment,4492678,4492678,8,0,nathan_f77,,,"I strongly disagree with this article.<p>I remember reading a story about some speaker (maybe Malcolm Gladwell?) who convinced business executives to just stop thinking, and make snap decisions from their gut feelings. However, it turned out to be terrible advice, and their businesses went downhill. (Sorry I can't provide citations.)<p>I saw Men in Black 3 tonight. There's a scene where Agent K decides to stop worrying about their problem, and just go and eat pie. They took a moment to think and talk about unrelated things, and J had an epiphany that solved their problem. As a programmer, I love being 'in the zone', when the hours feel like minutes. But sometimes I get stuck on a problem, and stepping away from the keyboard gives my brain a chance to regroup. More often than not, the solution just pops into my head while I'm thinking about something else.<p>If anything, I think entrepreneurs should try to spend <i>more</i> time thinking.
If you want to know what your customers want, you need to listen to them. Listening is defined as 'giving one's attention', and attention requires <i></i>thinking<i></i> about what they're trying to tell you.<p>Anyway, I think you need to strike the balance that works for you. That might be anywhere between 'just doing things and failing a lot', and 'over-analyzing every decision', but both extremes can be dangerous.",1347104693

The thing that struck me about that mindset, and particularly that <i>phrase</i> (and others like it) is that it presumes the person looking at me knows if I have a reason to smile/laugh or not.<p>There's no doubt a lot of layers in the thinking that produced that (and similar) phrases which I can't unravel or fathom, but it's still strange all the same.

During my time there, I felt there was a pervasive strain of ""We're the best in the world..."" getting shaded into ""...therefore nobody else is any good.""'<p>Really? I never ever felt that way during undergrad. I interacted with many grad students and every single one seemed more capable than I would ever be at their field (not self deprecating, just a true statement). While I would like to speak on behalf of all MIT students to say that this isn't likely, I can fully see this happening in small social circles. Maybe I got lucky, but I just never really saw this happen or felt that way towards grad students.<p>While interacting with some Harvard students, I definitely felt like I was the ""lower pedigree"" though. This is probably due more to the Cambridge rivalry than anything else though.<p>MIT is a pretty stressful place for grads and undergrads a like. Sometimes social skills aren't necessarily placed at the top of the list when there are many PSets, Exams, and other items above some pecking order ;).",1347104389

Both have disadvantages.<p>Some embedded systems do talk straight to the flash chips themselves and handle the wear levelling directly - I once put Linux on a BIOS-less x86 system with flash directly on the main bus where the ""bootloader"" did the equivalent of a memcpy to copy the kernel into a suitable location, set up some very basic stuff and jumped to it, and where the ""disk"" used an FTL (flash translation layer) driver that handled wear levelling in the kernel code.",1347103064

4492763,comment,4492426,4492585,2,0,morsch,,,"Huh. I guess the benefit is increasing the resolution while improving light sensitivity by removing the filter. For a couple of years, manufacturers tried to increase resolution size by packing more sensor elements (which end up as image pixels) on the same area, leading to a higher resolution. This ended up making each sensor element smaller, thus reducing light sensitivity.<p>So this is quite cool. I have to wonder, though, that even if you don't affect light sensitivity, if a higher resolution is going to be very useful. For instance, the glass you put in front of the sensor might affect sharpness in a way that 3x 18 MP won't look better than a Bayer pattern in front of 18 MP. Does anybody know how much light a Bayer filter eats?",1347102906

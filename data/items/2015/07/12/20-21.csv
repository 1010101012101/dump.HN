Traditionally, VCs have been able to collude together to prevent startups from increasing in valuation &quot;too fast&quot;. Unlike more efficient and less manipulated markets, which tend move in fast discontinuous jumps, VCs have been able to slow the top-performing companies to a slower exponential curve.<p>Because they&#x27;ve typically been able to slow this curve, waiting until the next round usually hasn&#x27;t caused them to lose nearly as much upside loss as it would, were the market more efficient.<p>With IPOs being pushed back, and more sophisticated IB investors moving into much earlier rounds now though, this is finally starting to change.<p>Keep this in mind whenever you hear VCs shouting &quot;bubble&quot;, just because some top startups aren&#x27;t following the smooth exponential curve in valuations, that any competent trader or economist could tell you should never exist in an efficient market.",1436734797

9874939,comment,9874468,9874468,0,0,bane,,,"I drive an old, small car. I&#x27;m about to get in the market for a new car once this one bites the dust. In 12 years, I&#x27;ve put more than 2 people in my car exactly 3 times. I&#x27;m interested in reasonable price, fuel efficiency and most of all reliability.<p>I admit I&#x27;m a little extreme in my car buying habits, but here&#x27;s what I think whenever I buy cars:<p>- Does this make model of car have extremely good reliability? I honestly can think of few things I hate more than servicing my car. I want it to be appliance-level reliable. My current car has been in the shop (outside of normal maintenance) maybe under 5 times...mostly as the vehicle has gotten old. How do I determine reliability? Years and years of compiled reliability surveys: Consumer Reports, True Delta, etc. I expect any car I buy to have been part of a legacy of at least 5 years of continuously high reliability. This immediately downselects and eliminates about 95% of the market.<p>- If it breaks, how expensive is it to fix? To return to a reliable operating condition, I don&#x27;t want to have to rebalance my entire finances.<p>- What&#x27;s the car cost to operate per mile? My current car runs around $.20-.25 per mile, fully burdened (repairs, tolls, etc.). I don&#x27;t want to spend much more than that and this car <i>could</i> easily hit that mark if it&#x27;s reliable and cheap to fix.<p>- Is it safe? I want top safety ratings all around. Period. I&#x27;m not going to fool with that stuff. As it turns out, makers that make reliable cars tend to also make very safe cars.<p>- Do I like how it looks/drives/etc? It may seem weird to lots of people that this is the last thing on my list. But I&#x27;ve already prevented any sort of decision paralysis by getting rid of 95+% of the market. At this point I&#x27;m down to just a handful of cars, and now I just pick the one I like. Now I know I&#x27;ll at least not mind driving it, and it won&#x27;t piss me off by being in the shop constantly. I don&#x27;t really care much about the image I&#x27;m projecting, I&#x27;m not trying to fit into some kind of clique or club or express myself. I just want to get to work as cheaply as possible and with a minimum of hassle. I&#x27;ll enjoy the clique I&#x27;m in when I retire with all the extra money I&#x27;ve saved not buying image cars.<p>Can the Elio support this? Maybe and it looks promising. I&#x27;d buy it if it met all the criteria. The price looks awesome. But I&#x27;m going to have to be patient for 4 or 5 years of general availability to see.",1436734618

Release after less than 4 years for murder? In our society most people don&#x27;t murder other people and that amount of time doesn&#x27;t send the message that it&#x27;s a seriously unacceptable thing to do.<p>So of course people were outraged by that sort of thing and now the pendulum has swung to the &quot;life means life&quot; and there is little to no consideration of prior record, behavior while incarcerated, or possible other extenuating circumstances.<p>Rather than parole, I guess I&#x27;d rather see more &quot;reasonable&quot; (try to get people to agree on that, though) sentences in the first place, with add-on time for bad behavior, rather than long sentences and a parole system. The whole concept of parole, and the administration and expense of implementing it, seems unnecessary. Sentence people based on the crime of which they are convicted, and take into account their past criminal history. If they misbehave in prison, add time. If they offend again after release, sentence more harshly. Why do we need parole?",1436733885

That VC, in turn, is more likely to invest than someone who is not particularly interested in security. If an investor really likes marketplaces or security companies or B2B SaaS or whatever, there are enough great companies in each of those segments to make it okay to ignore the other segments.<p>It&#x27;s also valuable to remember that partners at larger VC firms often lead 1-2 investments per year.

But few people believe this is what happens in practice. In practice, Reddit is moderated, it’s just that the moderation within a forum is carried out by the very people arguing with each other.<p>In a subreddit like/r/CoonTown, we are not going to find a free exchange of ideas with respect to race. If we want that, we have to go to a subreddit like /r/AskScience, where there is very active and aggressive moderation, and that moderation is associated with a set of laws restricting what you can and cannot say.<p>I think that there is a great deal of value in the idea of free speech, and in the utopian ideal of a free exchange of ideas. But I am not convinced that allowing all and sundry to create their own subreddits that represent finer and finer slices of single-issue society is the mechanism for enabling a free exchange of ideas.",1436732090

There are no valid reasons for it, because [it does not offer any evidence, even if it cites a study, I will ignore the existence of that study]. It is also not the consensus opinion of the experts who, I admit, know more then me [even if that consensus opinion is actually explicitly and loudly argued in the argument to be contrary].<p>Say, a bunch of scientists you admire create an encyclopedia of definitions, of say, living beings. You won&#x27;t find bigfoot there. You won&#x27;t find Yeti there. Likewise, &quot;sociopath&quot; and &quot;psychopath&quot; are not in the DSM. And so, by definition, then, the meat of the article actually simply attempts to merely point this out.<p>If the article was &quot;Bigfoot is a myth&quot;, it might be a little less heated. Because critics who disbelieve the bigfoot myth are less likely to be called bigfoot for doing so.<p>Everyone has their own language. Maybe they are not aware of the underlying etymology of the words &quot;sociopath&quot; or &quot;psychopath&quot;. These words, by etymology are extremely generic. One is sick in their dealings with society. Or one is sick in their own mind. So, one could say every definition in the DSM is, actually, both sociopathic and psychopathic.<p>Is there sickness in their mind? Are there social angles to that sickness? It would be hard to find a single definition in the entire DSM which did not meet one or both of those criteria.<p>So, saying &quot;sociopathy&quot; or the equivalent people use &quot;psychopathy&quot; is &quot;a myth&quot;, is just plain wrong.<p>Further, it is [not backed by my own standards which exclude the consensus book entirely] and it [does not help me pretend to understand others individually when I need a more generic, all inclusive term to understand them for my own reasons of depersonalizing them].<p>If you are of [a belief system most contrary to my own], or if you [state a belief I find not most useful to my own conscious purposes to believe], then you are wrong. And I will [attempt to produce a complex enough justification for that judgment to fool my own self and others]. And this is [exactly why I post, to try and create consensus opinion to come to a model I can use in the future and today which is less likely to be decimated by anyone else&#x27;s model].<p>And [the problem with this sort of critical post] is that [even though it is obscure I get a strong sense it declothes me], so I will [feel a strong need to actually try and cut it apart].",1436731568

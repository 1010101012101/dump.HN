10645813,comment,10641186,10641186,0,0,Mikeb85,,,"It&#x27;s simple maths.  Wherever you live, there&#x27;s a baseline amount of money that it costs to survive.  Food costs the same whether you&#x27;re rich or poor.  Housing varies, but there is generally a baseline.  If the baseline cost of living is $2000/month, and you make $2000 a month, you have $0 disposable income.  If you make $4000 a month, you have $2000 in disposable income.  If you make $8000 a month, you have $6000 per month disposable income, or 3 times that of the second scenario.  Since the cost of certain things is constant, as you make more money, your disposable income rises dramatically (until a certain point where gains are seemingly only incremental, at which point you&#x27;re no longer middle class).<p>The rich have more opportunity to save, thus they learn about saving.  They have capital, thus learn how to use it.  If you never save and never accrue capital, you&#x27;ll never understand it.  So any time you do end up with a windfall, you will inevitably squander it, since you&#x27;ve never had the experience of what to do with it.<p>Plus, money problems lead to stress.  My wife grew up poor, and even though we&#x27;re not doing badly today, it causes an immense amount of stress and is &#x27;mental overhead&#x27; for her.  She never wants to invest, is apprehensive about going to school herself, or basically doing anything that would deplete any amount of savings.  This inevitably prevents her from attaining a &#x27;higher&#x27; equilibrium, but I do understand the feeling (and for the record, based on where she came from, she&#x27;s actually doing fantastic and has experience doing things that none of her relatives even contemplate doing).  I grew up working class for this country (so probably the bottom end of &#x27;middle class&#x27;), but I&#x27;m stubborn with a bit of a gambling streak.  So I&#x27;m going to university, investing money, occasionally hustling for extra here and there (gambling, side jobs, etc...), and it&#x27;s mostly going OK.<p>Plenty of relationships end over money.  And when your world is falling all around you, it&#x27;s all too easy to turn to &#x27;escapes&#x27; such as drugs and alcohol.<p>This is a tech forum, so a little analogy.  A poor person is like a phone whose specs are just barely enough to run Android.  The experience is poor, laggy, and you can&#x27;t play too many games, or do any &#x27;productive&#x27; tasks.  Middle class is like an iPad pro or a decent laptop, you can do what you want for the most part, it&#x27;s a pleasant experience, but there are certain limitations.  Being rich is like having a super-computer - the potential is seemingly limitless, you can solve problems that are out of reach of the first two.<p>Right now I&#x27;m in University, and being working-class, it&#x27;s hard to compete with rich kids who live on their parents dollar.  Every day I work is less time to study.  Every time I have to cook dinner is less time to study.  And if I need to study a &#x27;minimum&#x27; amount to pass my courses, then I need to either sacrifice sleep or time with my wife.  And neither leads to a particularly great outcome.  So mostly I just suck it up and lose sleep, live off coffee, and am a solid &#x27;B&#x27; student rather than actually competing with the more privileged kids.  In the job market I&#x27;ll probably have to use my life experience and hustling streak, since I won&#x27;t compete on GPA or extra-curriculars.<p>Anyhow, just a few thoughts on the matter.  And these sorts of problems with income inequality are why more and more economists support the idea of a basic income.  It&#x27;ll allow the &#x27;poor&#x27; to have the ability to have disposable income with which they can get an education, or invest in themselves rather than work like dogs to barely survive.  While this may not seem fair for those who have already attained middle class or higher (who always claim they &#x27;earned&#x27; it, never mind the societal advantages they used), it&#x27;s better for society.  Unless you think having a serf class is a societal advantage (and there are people who think this)...",1448826843

As a quick overview, SystemML provides an R-like DSL, called <i>DML</i>, consisting of linear algebra primitives (vectors, matrices), built-in functions for common functions (such as sums, means, matrix construction, etc.), UDFs, etc., as well as a compiler/optimizer engine that can generate optimized runtime plans from the same DML script for a single node (laptop), Spark, or Hadoop MapReduce.  We definitely have algorithms already available as production-ready examples, but the goal of the project is to allow for <i>declarative</i> ML using customizable scripts written at the mathematical DSL level, rather than to provide a fixed <i>library</i> of algorithms at the base language level (Scala, Python, etc.).  MLlib (including the newer ML API) is awesome, and provides a great set of algorithms that fit in quite well with Scala, Python (& Java). SystemML is great in that it provides the ability to run customizable, linear algebra-based ML scripts (that can be automatically optimized within the engine) on Spark.  Together, it&#x27;s a great combo.  We also have an API for Scala that lets one embed DML into a Scala program similar in manner to how an SQL script can be embedded [<a href=""http://sparktc.github.io/systemml/mlcontext-programming-guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sparktc.github.io/systemml/mlcontext-programming-guid...</a>].<p>Here are our new Apache links:<p><a href=""https://systemml.apache.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://systemml.apache.org</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml</a>",1448826677

When we learned German in school (which is much more similar to my mother tongue Dutch), I found it <i>very</i> hard. German shows were also subtitled, but there were a lot fewer of them on TV.<p>Side-note: A few years ago, I read about a project for &quot;same language subtitling&quot; (of soap TV series, nonetheless) to improve literacy in India. Don&#x27;t have a link for that, unfortunately.<p>Your reasoning makes sense, and probably plays a role, but I believe subtitling of English TV plays at least as much of a role. A lot of German TV is dubbed, and the effect of this also carries over to smaller German-speaking countries, like Austria. Now one could argue that this is, according to your reasoning, because they are part of the larger German-speaking community. But that really isn&#x27;t the case, ask any Austrian, most of them will tell you their mother tongue is Austrian (which is not a written language, but also quite a bit more unique than merely German-with-a-dialect), and &quot;high German&quot; is definitely something they had to learn separately.",1448826274

The dynamicness of its current type system seems to offer me no advantages and is constantly causing me problems with performance. My code ends up covered in type declarations because I&#x27;m never sure when types are concrete or not,which kind of defeats the point of implicit typing. A lot of the time a seamingly innocuous change will result in Array{Float64,1} getting changed to Array{Any,1} which then gets propagated automatically though the whole program, since functions can&#x27;t have return types.<p>Julia claims to be the future of numerical computing, but they seem to put more effort into coming up with fancy abstractions that no engineer or scientist will ever understand than working on basic numerics. For example, the array implementation is very hit or miss and much much slower than and has much more complicated semantics than arrays in Fortran. I think this is due to the fact that arrays are not first class objects in the language, and probably because the authors don&#x27;t do much multidimensional high performance work.",1448824450

I&#x27;m not even sure a significant portion calling for his resignation would have supported an apology, if he decided to change his position. This is the opposite of a free, healthy, diverse society.<p>> It&#x27;s incredibly fallacious, though, to suggest that same-sex couples shouldn&#x27;t have the right to marry simply because there&#x27;s another tricky marriage-rights question out there.<p>My intention wasn&#x27;t to suggest that, but to note that for some reason gay rights are popular and polyamorous rights aren&#x27;t. If Eich had donated to keep polygamy illegal, not nearly as many people would have cared IMO. People are being denied rights in both cases, but only one is fashionable to support right now. That hypocrisy bothers me, not the legal status of same-sex couples.<p>This is veering further off-topic, but BTW I can think of one reason to not give all the same legal rights to polygamous marriages: it&#x27;s maybe too easy to &quot;abuse&quot; by marrying yourself to every friend you want to give a piece of your insurance coverage, tax breaks, etc.<p>> Hopefully some things that you and I believe today will be viewed as positively caveman-like in 200 years.

Middle class is not a specific dollar figure. It&#x27;s not owning a large TV. Middle class is when you don&#x27;t have the set of anxieties that cloud your judgement and depress your day.<p>Middle class means you don&#x27;t care if your paycheck gets delayed from Friday to Monday. Middle class is when you don&#x27;t have to count how many times a week you go to the laundromat.<p>Sadly, middle class, as evidenced by these responses, also means that you don&#x27;t see why other people would care if their paycheck gets delayed by a business day or two. It&#x27;s no big deal, you are convinced. Yet, there&#x27;s a woman that just started working, waiting for her first paycheck, which already had to be delayed due to starting date not aligning with payment schedules. And she has been planning to pay rent with this money, on the promised date. And yet, because some upper-middle-class manager with middle-class myopia forgot to submit <i>everyone</i>&#x27;s timecards on time (as required by the similarly-myopic corporate policy), everyone&#x27;s paychecks get delayed by a few days, including this woman&#x27;s. Now she has to deal with missing paying rent. True story, in modern liberal bastion of Massachusetts.<p>All you have to do is understand why it&#x27;s considerably more difficult for someone to improve their life, when starting from a much lower point, constantly being banged around by the ankles of the society.",1448823696

I removed the big Disqus logo on from my comments page, but people can still see that it's Disqus.<p>Their guidelines for use don't seem to mention whether they're OK with people removing their logo; they just say that you can customize it with CSS. Whether that's ethical I guess could be an entirely different debate... that being said, if they explicitly mentioned that you cannot remove branding, I'd put it back.",1226537878

However when you click through to a url for a specific story on their site, their system doesn't know how to handle it and just forwards you to the front page of the mobile version. It leaves you no way to get <i>to</i> the story via the url, because their system is detecting the iPhone Safari useragent and just shunting that traffic to the mobile version. It needs to know I'm trying to get to the specific url that I am trying to view. If that URL isn't available in an iPhone friendly version, then just show me the regular page. If it <i>does</i> have a friendly version, then show it to me in that version.<p>So when I say ""yet another site that doesn't correctly forward urls when surfing via iPhone"" I am absolutely correct.

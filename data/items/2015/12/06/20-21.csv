Eating junk food, caffeinated energy drinks, lack of exercise, lack of good food, lack of sleep, lack of socializing, lack of overtime pay, lack of professionalism, obsessive game play, lack of life balance, lack of decent working environment.  Before the 80s programmer culture felt very engineer / mathematician / academic, after the 80s its kinda felt like an introverts weird interpretation of an all night party, every night.  Here have a hot pocket and type all night.  A culture that prides itself on twinkies and monster energy drinks isn&#x27;t going to fit the nearly 100% female readership of the typical health magazine.  The stereotypical programming environment is nearly unique in the working world, isn&#x27;t it?  Are there any other job markets culturally like programming?  If there were, we could compare how the two fields opposition to personal hygiene or opposition to dressing fashionably, or even dressing in clean clothes might not appeal to women at similar rates, for example.  I&#x27;ve only found two work places kinda like programming/IT as defined above.  One is military mechanic and the other is SOME trading desks at big finance.  Both tend a bit male.<p>That&#x27;s directly on topic.  I suppose from an &quot;eating your own (addictive) dogfood&quot; perspective its kinda self inflicted.<p>It would be interesting to look at male/female relations and ratios for programmers at non-traditional employers, perhaps the government or military or maybe academic.  I suspect the lifestyle at a unionized state government office is quite a bit different than &quot;standard&quot; programming environment and theorize almost anything would be an improvement WRT women&#x27;s interest in that workplace.  Perhaps addictive behaviors would vary in those circumstances.<p>Surely there must be some HR statistics buried somewhere at a giant corporation or government about % of programmers participating in the corporate alcoholism project by decade, or something like that, WRT trends in addictive personality by decade.",1449435402

Each is separated and is accompanied by a big overhead from NodeJS. What would be great is a way to interact with the pubsub server not by config but with an API. This would allows, for example, the execution of middlewares when a user publishes a message (to filter them or something else). \nRight now, I&#x27;m using two websockets, one to Nginx PushStream only to receive messages and another to the NodeJS server to publish messages. The NodeJS server is used to parse the messages, format them, authenticate the user and apply the middlewares before publishing the message to Redis. Then, each NodeJS get the message from Redis and POST it to Nginx.\nThe problem here is that there is two sockets for each user and the complexity involved with the communication between Nginx and NodeJS.

Linguists can be lovers of language and philosophers, but they don&#x27;t have to be, they just measure what&#x27;s there. Language is made up by billions of people using it, and I consider my rejection of parts of it a curative effort. So I ask, with as much right as any other single human being using language: how does this particular &quot;invention&quot; move language forward? That other people might say it does, without anyone (I could find) giving an argument how it does, doesn&#x27;t really help.</i><p>One problem is that you could say it with any previous form of the language. Tons of the words you take for granted and accept evolved in a similar way. So why is &quot;literally&quot; bad and &quot;awful&quot; (worthy of awe originally) ok? The only honest answer would be &quot;because it happened before my time, and I was always used to that&quot;.<p>A second problem is the question itself: &quot;how does this particular &quot;invention&quot; move language forward?&quot;. If it&#x27;s used by the masses (as opposed to being a random error by some person), then it moves language forward, period. Languages don&#x27;t move forward by design, but organically, by people adopting this or that change or new structure. And for that to happen, the change needs to respond to some need.<p>The need doesn&#x27;t need to be rational and kosher. E.g. &quot;That word the most elegant way to minimally convey such meaning&quot;. It just has to serve the purposes of what it&#x27;s adopted for, namely to help speakers convey their message (including meta information like impatience, anger, emphasis, scorn, passive aggressiveness, affection, concern, etc).<p>><i>Where, exactly, is &quot;forward&quot;, here? Downstream? Even not gaming anymore, I noticed that &quot;kids these days&quot; tend to call low frame rates &quot;lag&quot;. I still know what they mean, but I also consider it regression and impoverishment of language and more importantly thought. And while it&#x27;s a silly example, I find it fascinating in a morbid way how things just get picked up and passed on.</i><p>The mistake here is that you have a preconceived notion of more detail translating to &quot;better language&quot; where the benefit in this case would be something else (e.g. succinctness or the ability to unify different but similar phenomena under a common term -- that is: abstraction.). Those are all legit benefits, and language needs to have mechanisms for that too (like we collapse all different kinds of cars, motorcycles etc into &#x27;vehicles&#x27;).<p>In this case, communication between gamers for such a trivial matter doesn&#x27;t need much extra detail beyond &quot;lag&quot;.

I was pushing for this back in 2003, but the volume wasn&#x27;t there.<p>There are quite good eye-safe flash LIDAR units.[1] Advanced Scientific Concepts in Santa Barbara makes some.[1]  A pulsed laser sends out a flash, and the receiver has a 128x128 pixel chip with time of flight counters for each pixel.  Range in hundreds of meters, in sunlight. No moving parts except a fan.  Cost is about $100K, because they are hand-made using custom ICs produced in tiny volumes.  Space-X uses one on the Dragon spacecraft to dock with the space station.<p>Back in 2003, when we were preparing for the DARPA Grand Challenge, I went down to Santa Monica to see the thing. But the demo was of components on an optical bench, aimed out a garage door into a parking lot.  The technology wasn&#x27;t ready to use yet, but it was clearly the right idea, something that would become cheap in volume.  They were working more on making the device more sensitive than on making it cheaper, because they were getting DoD funding.  Some of their units even have a photomultiplier tube stage, like an image intensifier.  The photoelectric effect is at the atomic level, and so fast you can use it in front of a time of flight device.<p>So we ended up using the SICK LMS scanner, like everybody else.<p>There&#x27;s a tradeoff between field of view and range with flash LIDAR, because there&#x27;s a limited amount of illumination power. A single one of these devices won&#x27;t give a full circle of scan, like the Velodyne rotating devices.<p>There&#x27;s a cheaper, but less precise, approach, used in the Kinect 360. That&#x27;s the ZCam technology.  See p. 13 of this paper [2] for how it works.  It&#x27;s a phase-shift type LIDAR; the outgoing beam is modulated with an RF signal, and the phase shift of the RF carrier is measured on return. That&#x27;s also all solid state, but not as good at rejecting interfering illumination.  It doesn&#x27;t have digital counters for each pixel; the timing system is analog.  So they don&#x27;t need counters running at tens of GHz behind every pixel.<p>Once someone is ready to order > 100,000 flash LIDARs, they&#x27;ll get cheap. The technology is not inherently that expensive.<p>The main reason for having a LIDAR is not to see obstacles. It&#x27;s to profile the terrain ahead.  You can detect potholes and drop-offs.  Since we were driving off-road for the DARPA Grand Challenge, that was absolutely essential.  Automatic driving systems for on-road use can sleaze by without doing that.  Most of the time.  Until they encounter a big pothole, or are misled by road markings into a ditch.  That&#x27;s why Google has that LIDAR up on top.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.advancedscientificconcepts.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.advancedscientificconcepts.com/</a> \n[2] <a href=""http://tesi.cab.unipd.it/47172/1/Tesi_1057035.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tesi.cab.unipd.it/47172/1/Tesi_1057035.pdf</a>",1449433523

At least that is my experience. Game artists often have experience with all sorts of in-house tools with UIs of highly varying logic and consistency, whereas most &quot;traditional&quot; designers have used Adobe tools and nothing else.<p>It seems to me that the success of Sketch lies in how little it diverges from the Adobe formula. Sketch doesn&#x27;t really add any new significant mental model: it adopts Illustrator&#x27;s terminology (such as artboards) and some of Photoshop&#x27;s bitmap capabilities, and cleans up the three decades of cruft that obstruct the Illustrator and Photoshop interfaces. That has clearly been a good recipe for something that&#x27;s easy to pick up for designers.<p>The UI layout tools in Xcode and Android Studio are not like that. The learning curve is very steep. Interface Builder is a tangled mess of quirky NeXT legacy and complex new concepts like auto-layout constraints. Android Studio&#x27;s UI editor is worse because it&#x27;s &quot;property editor hell&quot; -- editing layouts by twiddling Android&#x27;s endless and confusingly named properties will drive designers mad. (I used to think that Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Basic was the epitome of this type of tool, but Android is much worse.)<p>I&#x27;ve worked on a tool called Neonto Studio that tries to provide a designer-friendly cross-platform mobile UI solution:<p><a href=""http://neonto.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neonto.com</a><p>It generates native code for both iOS and Android, there&#x27;s no framework.<p>It has been really difficult to figure out a layout model that is both understandable to designers with Adobe/Sketch background _and_ can translate reasonably well to iOS and Android classes! Our current effort is pretty good, but it definitely has room for improvement.<p>Still, I would suggest that Neonto Studio is a much gentler way to introduce mobile UIs to a traditional designer than throwing them into the deep end of Interface Builder or Android Studio :)",1449433468

I did this recently with a novel by an author I used to love; I just felt the characters in the new novel were wooden and I noticed some basic editing errors. I returned the book to the library after about 40 or 50 pages.<p>As for the reasons behind this: I am not a programmer so for me the issue is not related to dealing with short lines of code. I think it is a combination of information overload, easy access to screens, and training our minds (through exposure to text messages, tweets, online updates, short video clips, etc.) to prefer condensed communication.<p>The trend makes me uncomfortable, but on the other hand, I also see it as part of the evolution of media and society. If we look back through history, we can see how other new media had a similar impact. Newspapers, film, and television changed styles of writing and peoples&#x27; preferences for reading materials and storytelling. Then, as now, there was great discomfort in the way media and storytelling evolved. A 1961 speech by the then-chairman of the FCC called television a &quot;vast wasteland.&quot; If you go further back, there was negative reaction to the introduction of radio, the use of photos in newspapers, and even opera, which was seen by 17th-century British intellectuals as &quot;chromatic torture.&quot; There has been a lot of thoughtful expository writing about this; if you are interested (and can manage to read an entire book) I recommend checking out Mitchell Stephens &quot;The Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word&quot; (1) and Walter Ong&#x27;s &quot;Orality and Literacy&quot; (2). They are somewhat dated now, but I think they really documented important transitions from antiquity to the end of the 20th century.<p>1. <a href=""https://www.nyu.edu/classes/stephens/rise%20of%20the%20image%20page.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nyu.edu/classes/stephens/rise%20of%20the%20image...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Orality-Literacy-Anniversary-Edition-Accents/dp/0415538386"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Orality-Literacy-Anniversary-Edition-A...</a>",1449433448

6826183,comment,6824740,6825751,2,0,mnordhoff,,,"Security FYI:<p>This situation concerns RSA keys, not 128-bit symmetric keys; our problem is &quot;factoring a really big number&quot;, not &quot;guessing a really big number&quot;. A 128-bit RSA key can be broken in seconds.<p>RSA keys are commonly 2048 bits at the moment. NIST&#x27;s rough rule of thumb is that a 2048-bit RSA key is equivalent in secureness to a 112-bit symmetric key; for 128-bit equivalence, you need around a 3072-bit RSA key. (2048 provides fine security for the next few decades at least.)<p>Edit:<p>You referred to &quot;128 bits of entropy&quot;, which could be interpreted as &quot;equivalent to a 3072-bit RSA key&quot;.

Only Ben really knows Ben&#x27;s intention - and he didn&#x27;t clarify it in either of the long comment threads on github. (If he did make explicitly misogynistic follow-up comments please correct me; I didn&#x27;t see any myself.)<p>Maybe he was insensitive or tone-deaf, maybe he should have made an exception (because perhaps commits like these have some sort of special significance that goes beyond simply fixing spacing issues in comments), maybe people should have talked to him and explained why others might have found his actions questionable - and, some of this did happen - but the hysterical response is really sort of scary.

6826062,comment,6825699,6825699,2,0,coliveira,,,"I am in favor of using Latin in some circumstances. People miss the fact that the great thing about a dead language is that it doesn&#x27;t change. However, if you write about science in English, for example, you can guarantee that 50 years from now your text will feel dated -- just try to read papers from the beginning of the 20th century. On the other hand, we still can read the great works of antiquity (from 20 centuries ago) in Latin. Also, a lot of scientific works were written in Latin during the renascence, and they are still available to us. Sadly, what is written in English will hardly last for more than a few hundred years. The only saving grace is that future generations will have automatic translation systems that will solve a lot of these problems.<p>Another issue with English is that it is a very imprecise language. You have to be extremely careful to write precise sentences in it. Latin, because of its grammatical nature, is much easier to handle in this respect. This is the same reason why it is much easier to understand philosophical concepts in German than in English. Just because English is widely understood (due to the cultural dominance of English-speaking countries), it doesn&#x27;t mean that we shouldn&#x27;t try to use a better language to express ourselves. Latin seems like a natural option due to its large impact on the western world.",1385871228

If Latin were actually a lingua franca, then, like that school completely ignores, linguas francas (francae?) aren&#x27;t there to replace the mother language (which includes all of the region&#x27;s folklore), just to complement it when talking to an outsider (that school isn&#x27;t, it is teaching reticulum interretiale only instead of internet first and then reticulum interretiale).<p>Also, from a pragmatist point of view, learning Latin today, and either using it as a lingua franca or not is pretty useless (there are exceptions, of course, like Philosophy, law, medicine, etc; but they aren&#x27;t that important in a day-to-day context).",1385871097

The filtered reviews sound like morons or shills; the unfiltered reviews sound like customers sharing an experience.  Paying Yelp to advertise doesn't seem to be a factor.<p>I'm just not feeling the hate.  My main problem with Yelp is that the star ratings are useless because everyone else's standards are different from mine.  I don't care if something is expensive; I'm happy to pay money for good food and good service.  But for other people, that's an automatic negative eight billion star rating.  So Yelp becomes essentially useless unless I read every review.  (I understand Zagat has controls for this, but I've never actually used it.)<p>And now for the statement that's going to get me in trouble: whenever I see an ad like a Yelp ad or an Adsense ad, it implies a certain amount of shadiness to me.

Most of the time the iPad 2 is used to casually browse the web on the couch, play chess and mess around with other games.  In none of these use cases has the iPad 2 screen resolution proven to be an issue at all.<p>Once usage becomes more serious iPad 2 goes on the shelf and I/we switch to computers.  All of our home computers are equipped with a minimum of two 24inch 1920 x 1200 pixel screens.  There is no way the iPad 2 or 3 experience can compete with this at any level.<p>I think Apple needs to fix the issue of carriers gouging customers for connectivity.  We have four iPhones and two iPads.  Why are we paying six fixed-cost, limited usage data plans when the devices are on WiFi most of the time?  Why is it that we can't buy a ""family"" plan, if you will, and pay one fee for connectivity.  That's what you do with DSL:  You pay one amount for a data rate and it doesn't matter if you have one or fifteen computers attached to the service.<p>The next revolution in mobile might not come until the recurring costs involved in using these devices come under control.",1331160343

I became a resource dealer.<p>The resource spawning system drew my attention, and I ended up spending countless hours developing tracking systems outside the game to both keep track of the current and past spawns as well as keep track of my harvester fleet. I knew almost immediately when the best Rhodium Steel for a particular weapon spawned and would drop every harvester on the strongest vein I could find.<p>For those unfamiliar with the resource mechanics of SWG, there was a fixed hierarchy of resource types that different crafting recipes required. The more advanced the recipe, the more specific the resource requirement (e.g., Rhodium Steel instead of just Metal). Every couple weeks the current spawn of a given type would dry up and a new one would come along to take its place with different stats. These stats ultimately determined the final stats of items crafted with the resource.<p>Resources also spawned in ""veins"" similar to how they're found in real life. The closer to the center of the spawn you were, the more yield your harvesters produced. It was possible to effectively block out any competition by placing enough harvesters on a vein, and this is exactly what I did.<p>At one point I even started doing ""contract"" work for the high-end crafters. They would give me a quantity of a resource they wanted and I would deliver it daily as the harvesters collected.<p>At the end (sometime around when the Jedi questing was introduced) I had amassed enough credits that I was within the top 5-10 on the server I played.

3677576,comment,3676776,3677465,6,0,bunderbunder,,,"Heck, for me 3G is the fastest data available to me.<p>However, 3G (and 4G) are much more expensive, in terms of the price it costs to transmit a given quantity of data.  And compared to glass and copper, the total number of bits available within a given geographic area at any given moment is a fraction as large.  Unfortunately, cellular companies failed to realize that offering ""unlimited"" data plans would set up poor expectations.  They (apparently) didn't anticipate seeing a significant percentage of their customers try to use the cellular networks for transferring large quantities of data, and thought that for most people ""unlimited"" would just be a marketing-friendly euphemism for ""a couple hundred megabytes.""<p>In turn, people who assumed that ""unlimited"" really means unlimited, and assumed that the prices that were originally offered for ""unlimited"" were realistic prices for high volumes of cellular network usage, now seem to think that the prices that cellular network providers want to charge for data usage are rapacious.  On the contrary, it's not that the price they're trying to charge now is disastrously high; it's that the price that they used to be charging was disastrously low.<p>There's also a serious resource contention issue on cellular data.  The towers can only be placed so close together before they start interfering with each other, and the bandwidth that's being advertised is the bandwidth you'll get <i>if you've got the tower to yourself</i>.  Chicago's an illustrative story: A company came along offering household internet service through a 4G network, promising impressive bandwidth numbers.  And they delivered on them for the few months between when they first opened for business and when they started getting serious traction in the market.  Since then, they've earned a reputation as a pretty crappy ISP, simply because the technology itself couldn't deliver quality service to that many users at once.  A wireless network cell is effectively a hub, and like on any hub resource contention can be a serious issue.<p>Which, I suspect, is ultimately why Apple goes along with the file size caps for cellular network transfers: From a user experience perspective, they would much rather allow everyone to transfer small files at high speeds, than let everyone's user experience suffer because the network is being choked by large file transfers.",1331159158

3677535,comment,3675830,3676888,2,0,rwallace,,,"For example, there has been a lot of talk for the last few decades about bioterrorism. In 2001, it finally happened; a bioterrorist attack occurred. It killed five people.<p>In the meantime, natural infectious diseases kill several million people every year, and far worse is possible. In 1918-1919, a flu epidemic killed two or three times as many people in a single year as the First World War had killed in four years. In 2002-2003, a SARS outbreak killed a thousand people before it was stopped by quarantine measures. We got off _very_ lightly; SARS is at least as infectious as the 1918 flu, is no more curable, and has nominally roughly twice the lethality rate. The real lethality difference is higher, for the 2002-2003 outbreak was small enough that most of the victims could receive oxygen treatment, which significantly improves survival; in a pandemic, of course, there would not be enough such treatment to go around. And there have been historical plagues deadlier by far than SARS. Terrorists have political goals relative to which the weapon that killed their own communities and families would be counterproductive. The forces of mutation and natural selection working on disease organisms have no such reason for restraint.<p>Now what exactly do the bioterrorism criers think is going to happen if they start being taken seriously enough to influence policy? It's only too obvious what's going to happen, because it's the same thing that always does: more regulation on biotech research, more red tape, more of the sort of field day for the paranoid and bureaucracy gone mad that we already see in the security theater at airports. It's hard enough to fly to Disneyland in those conditions, let alone do cutting-edge research.<p>And so when - not if - something deadlier and more insidious than SARS does come along, whatever chance we might have had of being prepared for it may end up being thrown away.<p>It's not difficult to understand why our instinctive assessment of threats is so wildly irrational. In the ancestral environment there was plenty of disease, to be sure, but almost no medicine, so little selection pressure to be sensitive to that threat. Violence was the main cause of death _that you could do something about_. The human brain is wired to assume our fellow man is the primary threat, regardless of the facts.<p>But we can sometimes override even hardwired assumptions, once we understand that we live in a world in which they are no longer true. We had better learn to override this one, and quickly.",1331158542

Their friends write five star reviews about how wonderful the owner is and how they always have their anniversary dinner there. They create multiple fake accounts and complain loudly that their positive reviews have been filtered.<p>We've also noticed a certain tone businesses and their friends use. They don't typically describe a particular experience, they describe a business in generalities and will often refer back to what other reviewers are saying. They also appear to take what other people think very personally.<p>The very first four-star filtered review this business has mentions the waitress and host by first name (she goes on to sign it). Many of the other reviews for this business are similar and come across as fake or by people who mean well, but go overboard on behalf of their friends.<p>A common looking filtered review (notice effusiveness, caps wording, and referencing other reviews):<p>""This is a NICE restaurant - one that you go to when you want a quiet meal away from the kids - it's definitely not family-oriented, but then again, not every restaurant needs to be.  If you're used to Olive Garden as your Italian ""go-to place"", then you will probably be disappointed in Fior d'Italia.  If you want REAL Italian food, then ignore the naysayers and come here.""<p>Yelp itself has rough stats for the breakdown of reviews:<p>5 stars: 38%\n4 stars: 29%\n3 stars: 14%\n2 stars: 8%\n1 star: 11%<p>Yelp's little secret is actually that the star ratings don't provide very much granularity for the casual review reader to make a decision and that most restaurants average out to ~3.75 or in Yelp parlance ~3.5 - 4 stars.",1331158400

Most folk are happier minimising their regrets; review services should help that to occur.<p>Part of the problem with something like yelp is that there's no way to gatekeep the genuine and false reviews. Netflix or Amazon, for example, <i>know what you actually paid for</i>. Yelp's got no way to know if you really dined at the restaurant or whether you just know the owner.",1331157824

So, if you are doing 1 million units and running your tooling 6000 hours per year, then if the cycle time is less than 20 seconds for any operation, then you are not fully using that piece of equipment.  If you are doing 15M units a year, you will need to design/build/buy 10-100 units for each manufacturing step.  That cuts your cost tremendously, because the custom design and engineering only needs to be done once.",1331157784

Redundancy.<p>A single server isn't good for uptime because when it dies you're screwed.  At the next level, a single data-center only gives you so much uptime because if that data center goes down you're screwed.<p>Same thing here.

(Besides it being completely untrue). I avoid certain Burger King locations because I know how poorly they perform.  Meanwhile, the reviews on Yelp actually reflect that franchise service can vary.<p>Let's address the pompous overtone of your post implying that fast food cannot be ""good"" and therefore should not receive 5-stars.  Oddly enough your apparent attitude creates one of the major problems with rating systems.  You seem to be a customer looking for a Michelin rated meal while ordering food served on a paper plate.<p>If I want fast food, 5 stars means something different than if I want a multi-course meal, means something different than if I want a slice of pizza, means something different if I want ethnic food.",1331157677

That you can find an exact mapping does not prevent the underlying API from being more complex than what you need. That you had to realize ""Oh, m=2"" is more complexity.<p>I'm not arguing this is a terrible thing. In fact, I think this is an acceptable level of additional complexity for the power it buys you.

Yelp can't give venue owners the transparency they're asking for, because that means also giving them the information that they'd need to game the system. It's the same reason that Google only speaks in broad terms about its search updates: after a certain point, the information that you need to see to prove that the system is fair, is the <i>exact same information</i> that you need to see in order to exploit the system.  So neither Google nor Yelp shows it, and I'm fine with that.",1331157642

With Yelp, I find myself having to read through reviews and trying to apply context to the reviews and I still find the recommendations more random overall. I still use Yelp, but if I'm looking for a quick ""Where do I eat on this business trip that's near my hotel?"" Zagat is quick and unlikely to steer me (too) wrong.<p>I agree with  another poster who recommended Chowhound--again if you're willing to spend some time reading rather than just looking for a quick 2 or 3 restaurants to choose from.",1331157633

If, for example, you can know immediately when someone violates law X (because of advanced technology), you can still select to apply that to those you want to target only. (One can imagine the McCarthyism government using that knowledge to target &quot;commie sympathizers, or the apartheid govervnemt against blacks, dissidents etc).<p>(a) some violations being 100% detectable (which is what technology can offer) and (b) fines/jail being enforced to 100% of the violators (which is a policy issue) is a totally orthogonal thing. And since we can&#x27;t trust policy 
decisions, I wouldn&#x27;t like having (a) either.<p>Second, even if we have (a) and (b), how about when it&#x27;s not for all laws? (which realistically, it wouldn&#x27;t be).<p>If any drug use is immediately detected with some future technology and its use punished, for example, tons of heroin users, who otherwise have done nothing wrong besides possession, would go to jail. And it&#x27;s not necessary that this will have a big enough backslash to repeal the relevant law (after all, all the marijuana laws that affected millions weren&#x27;t repealed for decades). To continue with this example, I&#x27;d still like most drug addicts to be free, even if the occasional unlucky one is caught.<p>I don&#x27;t like perfect 100% systems -- I prefer things to have cracks, is what I&#x27;m saying.

That 3 months turned into an entire chapter (~15 pages) of my thesis. But I will tell you a little bit about it.<p>The data we were analyzing was biological and it wasn&#x27;t actually an image. However it could reformatted as an image so we could apply computer vision algorithms to it. The thesis was first about the computer vision stuff being applied to biology and second about moving the computation to the GPU to speed it up. It went from ~1 hour to 15 secs when the computation was moved to the GPU. The problem with the GPU though is it only has so much RAM, and the PCIe bus to transfer data to it is rather slow. To make matters worse, getting data off disk is even slower and the GPU expects a certain data format for optimal processing.<p>The majority of the 3 months was not writing code. The majority of the 3 months was developing our own custom file format. The GPU wanted a particular format for optimal data transfer and the computer vision algorithms needed a particular format to be able to work. So it was about creating a file format that was fast off disk and through the PCIe bus and still had the correct formatting necessary for the computer vision algorithms. The exact specifics of the data format and why it had to be a certain way are what would take many pages of text to explain so I will stop.<p>If I used a DB instead, I could have simply put the data in a table and used rather simple SQL commands to get the data off the disk in the format the GPU and computer vision algorithms wanted. And it would have been about as fast and only taken maybe a week at most of effort (remember most of the time was spent on the data format). In other words, I could have graduated 3 months sooner which seems worth it to me.<p>Just to be clear, I never said SQL is faster than mmap although there are cases where it can be. What I said was it was usually not worth the effort to make it as fast or faster. It is kinda like C/C++ vs Python/Ruby/Javascript/etc. Yes your program will be a lot more efficient if you use C/C++, but is it really worth the time if you can do the same thing in a higher level language with little effort? There are cases where it is appropriate to use C/C++, but I would argue it is more the exception than the rule.<p>Databases are kinda like that for me now after learning how to use them properly. Can I beat them for my specific use case? Probably yes, but is it really worth the effort? Most of the time no, but there are exceptions.",1415712166

I only use Gmail via IMAP in Thunderbird, so I've already migrated my address book and calendar to self-hosted webDAV, which was shockingly easy.<p>The last thing to switch over is Gmail.  I used to run a mail server in the past so I know what a pain in the ass it is.  I was thinking that something very useful would be some sort of big Bash script that would install and configure webDAV and a mail server using existing packages with smart defaults, specifically for individuals hosting their own personal mail.  Kind of like an owncloud, but for address books/calendar/email and using existing packages.<p>I'll see if I can think of this further once I actually sit down and start running my own mail server again.

The minstrel, (I kept mis-spelling it in ways that looked like ""menstrual,"" to the great amusement of my friends and co-workers.)  It worked fine;  the only problem was that the palm V only had one serial port... if I used the CDPD modem, (which doubled the thickness of the palm v,)  I couldn't plug in the keyboard, meaning SSH wasn't really practical.  (on-screen keyboards have never worked for me;  not then, not now.)<p>The external keyboard for the palm V was pretty nice, though, assuming you had a flat surface.   The serial port made a pretty solid connection and held the phone up at a reasonable angle;  something I haven't been able to reproduce with a modern smartphone and external bluetooth keyboard.  (To be clear, the bluetooth keyboards work fine;  I just haven't figured out how to hold the phone at a reasonable angle while typing with both hands.)<p>So yeah, really?  I wasn't all that less mobile then than I am now.   I mean, I had a thinkpad running linux then, just like now;  sure, it was slower, but it ran linux just fine.

5441583,comment,5440909,5440909,26,0,bobwaycott,,,"Perhaps the better approach to solving this problem is to stop repeating it on tech blogs, and start moving to publishing and discussing it in HR blogs and similarly appropriate, targeted mediums. As stated elsewhere[1], this is undoubtedly the existing mentality of the audience to whom this article is written. Those who actually need this advice are the existing and future HR managers and departments who are in charge of hiring.<p>I spent some time about a year-and-a-half ago building up and managing a small internal development department at a mid-size corporation. I was involved in finding talent to fill development roles in the company twice. The first time, I sat in on an existing search and interviews for a role in a different department. The process could not have been more broken--the position had been open for roughly one year, and the interviews yielded no hirable candidate (as judged by the individuals making the hiring decision). The second time, I led a search for positions freshly opened for my department. The process could not have been more smooth--three strong candidates were hired within three weeks. The only significant difference between the two hiring pushes was the approach--the first was focused entirely on a candidate who had <i>n</i> years of experience on platform <i>X</i>; the second focused on candidates who showed the greatest talent and aptitude in previous professional and personal projects, and gave the greatest indications they were a great fit for the personality of the team.<p>After we completed our hirings, the VP of HR pulled me aside to mention she'd never seen anyone conduct interviews like we did (she sat in on a couple after hearing about how we'd done the first candidate interview), and was impressed by the way the candidates responded in the interviews. She could ""feel"" which candidates were going to be hired, even though she had no knowledge of software development. We discussed the differing approaches between hiring for talent and hiring for <i>n</i> years of <i>X</i> experience. She intuitively understood the difference, but had not ever seen it in practice as intentionally as we pulled off.<p>Programmers understand this. Small businesses who are predominantly programmer-driven or -dependent understand this, too. Even big businesses who are primarily technology-focused show signs of getting this as well (a recent round of interviewing with an Oracle company surprised me with how much they were focused on the <i>right</i> things).<p>The proverbial dragon to slay here is the HR departments, managers, students, and training programs lacking this advice as fundamental practice. Perhaps we need to see more process-oriented and manager-level technologists joining up with HR professionals to advance the point. Maybe HR departments and educational efforts could start creating Developer Advocates to assist in crafting better approaches and more finely tailored practices to support development/engineering talent. These might be the vanguard of producing better job descriptions and interview processes to hire talent that is more competent, productive, dependable, and retainable.<p>The most important lesson I learned when I worked with a formal HR department to hire new people is that <i>they care</i>. They really do. They don't want to hire terrible candidates who are going to be miserable, hate their jobs, and drag down a team. They want to empower people to improve professionally while taking care of a company's needs. We need to start working with and spreading this advice among the HR professionals who will increase their value to both companies and personnel by including it in their standard procedures.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5441337"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5441337</a><p>[edit: forgot link & punctuation error]",1364276779

Spam is actually the one thing that I find gmail weaker at compared with self hosting.<p>My nearly stock Postfix setup with a few basic anti-spam settings, rejects about 80% of spam. Then stock SpamAssassin config (with a nightly sa-update cron job) gets accuracy somewhere into the 90s. The SpamAssassin Bayes plugin takes it to very close to 100% (maybe 2 or 3 Spams per year).<p>The best part is that I'm in control -- when someone continues to send annoying email even after being asked to stop (like our daughter's old childcare provider), I can add a Postfix rule to reject their mail at SMTP time and enjoy knowing that for every email they send, they'll get a Non-delivery report from their SMTP server complete with a personal message from me.<p>Another example: an acquaintance liked to send mass mailers to everyone in his address book of the quality on par with most people's facebook/twitter status updates, followed by a barrage of useless replies from people I don't know. After realizing I never want to see those kinds of messages from anyone, I added a regex to Postfix header_checks to reject messages with more that 15 @ symbols in To: or Cc:.<p>Another benefit of self hosting is unlimited temporary email aliases (e.g. temp123@example.com). Many places don't accept the standard myemail+temp123@example.com sub-address that gmail supports (and a spammer can easily identify), and it's nice to be able to tell when companies abuse my email.",1364275649

Granted, many of those guns are designed more for killing bears and moose than people, but they'll do the job, and most people have a combat-oriented pistol or two. I got a rifle for my fifth birthday.<p><i>I'm shocked that people litteraly sell knives designed to hurt people on the internet, and that people on HN come to the defence of these arms dealers.</i><p>Most of the knives in question are general-purpose utility knives. They are not designed to hurt people, and that is not the reason most people own them. I carry a Kershaw Leek myself; it has a 3 inch blade, assisted opening, a frame lock and a pocket clip. I routinely use it to open packages, trim rough edges off various objects, cut rope, strip wire, scrape contaminants off surfaces and remove those nasty little sticky screw covers from laptop computers. I have studied and practice the use of a knife as a weapon, but that is not a significant reason I carry a knife, and I would carry a different knife (or more likely, a pistol) if it was.<p>I've been to the UK. I did not bring my knife because I knew it would be illegal to carry there. Turns out, it's probably illegal to <i>own</i> there, and the multitool I usually keep in my backpack might be illegal to carry in public because it has a locking blade. I never really noticed how much I use my knife until I started going to Europe regularly and couldn't bring it along. I'm <i>constantly</i> reaching for it and finding it missing. I've been carrying a knife of some sort since I was 12.<p><i>Since then, that government has entrenched power to the point where it would be nearly impossible for even another state to take it down, let alone a group of armed civilians - thus rendering the constitutional clauses irrelevant to their original purpose.</i><p>Aside from the fact that some Americans aren't so happy about that, I think you're mistaken. A large minority of the civilian population would have a much easier time deposing the government and instituting a new one than a foreign state (or group of US states attempting to secede) would. A foreign state attempting to overthrow the US government would have to deal with a fully committed US military <i>and</i> a large portion of the civilian population, which, as you noted is well armed. A large minority of the population rising up against the government would likely gain the support of some of the military and could blend in with the rest of the population when not fighting.<p><i>In the rest of the developed world where weapons are generally banned, as they are in the UK, criminals simply don't use weapons on civilians because the penalties for doing so are so harsh</i><p>I don't think that's the reason. Penalties for being a felon in possession of a firearm in most US states are severe. Having a weapon while committing a crime, even if it was otherwise legal to have the weapon and the weapon was not used in the crime usually comes with a significant mandatory minimum prison sentence. Firing a gun during another crime means decades in prison.<p>Criminal-on-civilian violence actually <i>is</i> pretty rare though; the vast majority of violent felonies in the US are criminal-on-criminal. The danger to civilians from Johnny the drug dealer shooting Jimmy the drug dealer is small.",1364274646

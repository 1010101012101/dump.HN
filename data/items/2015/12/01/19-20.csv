Dan Price became famous for raising his employees salaries so that none made under $70,000. Shortly he did that, a story broke that Dan was being sued by his brother Lucas, who was demanding that Dan buy his stake out. Dan and his spokespeople represented to the media that the suit was a reaction to the pay raise, which reduced profits for owners to pay employees.<p>But it turns out that Dan was served for the lawsuit before the pay raise, and that Dan&#x27;s legal response to the suit also precedes the raise. It does not seem likely that the lawsuit had anything to do with the raise. It is now plausible (but unproven) that the raise was a tactical reaction to the suit.<p>Furthermore, Dan Price&#x27;s ex-wife alleges that Dan was physically violent to her.

10658189,comment,10648831,10656310,0,0,pron,,,"> Coq&#x27;s huge library of tactics and proofs of facts that TLA+ might just throw at a model checker are, in my experience, very useful starting points for things that can&#x27;t be model checked.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re saying. What does TLA+ have to do with the model checker? TLA+ is a language, while TLAPS (the proof system) and TLC (a model checker) are two different products (each supporting different subsets of TLA+, BTW). TLAPS comes with its own library of proofs. I don&#x27;t know how extensive they are.<p>AFAIK, you can&#x27;t (and certainly you don&#x27;t) take a fact verified by the model checker and state it as an axiom of your proof. The interaction between the two -- if any -- is that Lamport encourages you to model check your spec before trying to prove it (assuming you want to prove it, or even model-check it) because proving things that are false may prove hard. However, the result of the model checker play no part in the proof.<p>When it comes to proofs, TLA+ is intended to be declarative and independent of the proof engines used (by default, TLAPS uses SMT (any of several solvers), Isabelle and another couple of tool, passing every proof step to every tool unless a tactic specifies a particular one).<p>This is a nice introduction for the design of the TLA+ proof language: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/proof.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/p...</a> which includes (in the appendix) a few proofs in calculus.<p>> it&#x27;s pretty hard to believe that someone could study it for 30 years and not understand it better (in some sense) than ZF. That&#x27;s a pretty extraordinary claim.<p>I did not mean to claim that type theory researchers don&#x27;t understand it better than basic college set-theory. I meant that <i>in general</i>, engineers and academics are more familiar with basic set theory.<p>> just because you can code up some of its ideas in another logic (in a way that counts as a novel contribution worthy of publication, no less).<p>That was a technical report that mentioned in passing using an approach similar to separation logic.<p>> &quot;everything&#x27;s a TM&quot;-style arguments you&#x27;re making here<p>I am not making that argument. My argument is that most engineers and CS academics (except those in PLT) would be more familiar -- and therefore more likely to use -- a tool based on basic math they know well. In addition, I haven&#x27;t seen anything to suggest that the complexity difference between specifying a system using dependent types and specifying it in TLA+ is significant at all in either direction. Learning Coq, however, requires much more effort, and AFIK, it doesn&#x27;t support formal verification mechanisms other than proofs (e.g. model checking)<p>> perhaps you simply aren&#x27;t interested in and so don&#x27;t care about the use cases where Coq shines?<p>Perhaps. I design data structures (mostly concurrent), and my interests lie in specifying and verifying those as well as distributed systems, and less in verifying compilers. My current TLA+ spec is too complex to be proven anyway (regardless of the tool used) in any feasible amount of time, so I rely on just the spec as well as some model checking.<p>It is also true that I may be biased. As an &quot;algorithms guy&quot; I feel more at home working with tools and languages designed by other algorithm people (and more importantly <i>for</i> algorithm people) rather than PLT people.<p>Nevertheless, I&#x27;m interested in learning the difference between the two.<p>> But really, based on the arc of this conversation, I would be enormously surprised if you chose to use Coq to prove X, even if there were a proveX tactic already written in Coq and the TLA+ implementation would take all day<p>Considering that learning Coq would take me much longer than a day, that would be a wise decision.",1448999211

10658150,comment,10657984,10657984,0,0,patio11,,,"You should certainly not use your main personal cards on the behalf of the business, simply for segregation of accounts to assist bookkeeping.  (This goes for all founders from day one.  Credit cards are available like candy; get one for business use and business use only early, early early.)<p>Whether you get a &quot;business card&quot; is less important; for many founders/companies they&#x27;re substantially harder to get than personal cards.  You&#x27;d think this distinction would matter a lot, but practically speaking the principals of most small companies will be asked for a personal guarantee on any card issued to the business anyhow, so that&#x27;s a distinction mostly without a difference.  <i>Typically</i> they also come with worse protections and terms than consumer cards.  (e.g. I have two cards from BoA, one in the name of the business with a personal guarantee and one issued to myself as a natural person.  The business card has 1000 basis points higher APR, worse protections, lower limit, and an equivalent rewards program.)<p>As to which card you pick: there exist copious websites which will attempt to sway your opinion on this, mostly to earn an affiliate commission.  There also exist a lot of people with strange hobbies online, and maximizing the value of CCs/reward points/etc is a hobby which is quite well-represented.  I&#x27;ll save you a few hours: the SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) Amex almost always wins.  Personal favorite perks: bonus points awarded for Uber trips during hotel stays (i.e. business travel, when I consume a <i>lot</i> of Uber), free Wifi at SPG properties and Boingo (sadly not Gogo), and a very favorable SPG-points-to-dollars-saved-on-hotels ratio.  (I recently took a free night in Austin for 16k points; due to it being a high-demand weekend the hotel was quoting about $500 for a cash stay.  This implies a 3.1 cents a point valuation, which is much, much higher than points are typically worth -- Delta miles and IHG points, for example, are a lot closer to a penny apiece.)<p>Obligatory maximization advice:<p>1)  The most important thing you can do with business credit card statements is <i>make sure you do not forget to get them entered into your books</i>.  Your tax rate on the marginal dollar of profit is likely to be 30%+ -- this totally swamps the value of your points/saved interest if you screw up even a page worth of CC statements once a year.  (Ask me about the time I almost had $14k of marginal income imputed due to a page which fell on the floor at tax time, for a $5k extra tax bill.)<p>2)  Selling more software is a much, much faster way to make money than exploiting the difference between a 1% cash back (trivial) and the Optimal Possible Business Travel Planning.  The people who invest a lot of themselves into travel hacking largely do it because it&#x27;s a fun, somewhat intellectually engaging hobby.<p>Websites to read on this topic (and, like mentioned, they make their money when they get you to apply for a credit card):<p>ThePointsGuy.com\nRamit Sethi @ iwillteachyoutoberich.com<p>Google for their most recent stuff.  The best promotion changes on a week-to-week basis.  It&#x27;s, again, really, really not worth your time to chase it given that you could be running a software business instead.",1448998935

I&#x27;ve always found it rather unhelpful, though relatively straightforward for simple bindings. (I don&#x27;t like to comment about anything more involved.) But, even once you&#x27;ve got your own wrappers in place for converting Lua userdata objects to pointers to your custom types, and whatever, your average Lua binding still looks like this:<p><pre><code>    1. Get arguments from stack one by one\n\n    2. Call C function with arguments\n    \n    3. Push result(s) to stack one by one\n\n    4. Return number of results\n</code></pre>\n(You can write your own system to automate all of this this - rather more straightforward in C++ than in C - but that is hardly evidence that the C API is especially useful.)<p>Suppose you have a function in lua, `f(x,y)&#x27; that you want to forward to your C function, `int f(int x,double y)&#x27;. You need to do something like this:<p><pre><code>    int lua_f(lua_State *L) {\n        int x=luaL_checkinteger(L,1);\n        double y=luaL_checknumber(L,2);\n        int result=f(x,y);\n        lua_pushinteger(L,result);\n        return 1;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n(It&#x27;s worth having a scrabble through to see what the luaL stuff is doing internally, because some of it is string-happier than you might like. luaL_checkudata seems particularly rude.

At companies with sales like Gravity’s net revenue, the top quartile pay falls to about $373,000. At companies with a similar number of employees as Gravity, the top quartile of CEOs makes $470,000 in salary and bonus. The CEO of JetPay, a publicly traded competitor that processes a similar volume as Gravity, received $355,000 in 2014.<p>$1.1 million on CEO salary sounds ridiculous given a $2.2m profit.",1448998177

Imagine reading 4 GB from one disk then writing it all to another, all at 1 MB/sec.  If your block size is 4 GB, It&#x27;ll take 4000 seconds to read, then another 4000 seconds to write... and will also use 4 GB of memory.<p>If your block size is 1 MB instead, then the system has the opportunity to run things in parallel, so it&#x27;ll take 4001 seconds, because every read beyond the first happens at the same time as a write.<p>And if your block size is 1 byte, then in theory the transfer would take almost exactly 4000 seconds... except that now the system is running in circles ferrying a single byte at a time, so your throughput drops to something much less than 1 MB/sec.<p>In practice, a 1 MB block size works fine on modern systems, and there&#x27;s not much to be gained by fine-tuning.",1448998162

You&#x27;re supporting 3 systems. It&#x27;s not unreasonable to maintain 3 branches for 3 branches of the code, and with tools like `git` it&#x27;s easy to backport features when it&#x27;s possible without code change. This also gives you better measurement of the cost of maintaining support for legacy systems so you know when it&#x27;s time to pay the cost of upgrading. And when you do upgrade, you simply stop patching the CentOS 5 branch, and you&#x27;re not left with a bunch of if statements in your active codebase testing for a system that you no longer care about.<p>SaltStack might do better when targeting, for example, many many different Linux distros. But even then, it only solves a 99% use case, and the tools are opaque enough that fixing the 1% may take just as much time as writing more portable bash.<p>> There&#x27;s also the non-DRYness of &quot;a whole bunch of bash scripts.&quot; You could maybe figure out some sort of include system to avoid repetition, but it&#x27;s bash... it won&#x27;t be pretty.<p>It&#x27;s really not that complicated or bad. `source` is typically all you need.<p>There&#x27;s also a larger antipattern here, which is that if your configuration is so complicated that you&#x27;re feeling pain, you&#x27;re probably not curating your dependencies very well. Configuration isn&#x27;t the worst way in which you&#x27;re going to feel this pain: if you&#x27;re letting so many dependencies into your system that you&#x27;re having trouble installing them all, you&#x27;re almost certainly installing a lot of bad libraries and you&#x27;re going to find that you also have trouble implementing features using libraries that are poorly-designed.

Those same things exist on iOS, but I keep hearing people say the MAS is somehow worse. From Apple&#x27;s perspective, the sandbox limits are arguably justified by a desire to provide greater security and privacy controls. The review process is basically a consequence of that same goal - though of course, review time could be greatly reduced.<p>It sounds like the core issue for people is sandboxing. But what specifically about sandboxing is the issue? Are the sandbox limits really too restrictive for most apps (I guess new APIs/permissions could improve that with time), or are there just a lot of developers who prefer not to rework their apps to deal with the sandbox restrictions? Or is the very idea of sandboxing the problem (or perhaps the default security setting for allowed app installation)?<p>As long as apps can be distributed outside the MAS, I guess I don&#x27;t really understand the problem. The MAS adds a lot of convenience, but as usual, the convenience comes at a cost, and thankfully users and developers can take it or leave it.",1448997509

The problem is that emphasising brutality and ugliness in the style of the Culture may over time lead to a shift in perception normalising agression, or in other words, it could shift the Overton Window towards militarism. For example, if ships were named something like &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; or &quot;Ambassador&quot; rather than &quot;Torturer&quot; or &quot;Thug&quot;, it would lead to a perception of peace-keeping as their intended role.<p>It works in the case of the Culture because of their extraordinary degree of self-awareness and anti-militarism; no member of the Culture could possibly lack cognizance of the significance of the names, wheras we, alas, live in somewhat less enlightened times. In the Culture it serves to emphasise the ugliness of their purpose, wheras if applied in our world could be all to easily misinterpreted as unvarnished militarism.<p>It is interesting to note the degree of anti-militarism in Japan. Though this may be taken to an extreme in the opposition to taking part in international peacekeeping missions, at the very least it means that Japan is very unlikely to be subject to escalating influence and dominance by the military as may be permitted in other countries due to general public apathy.

So on this point, that might actually be good feedback to that professor, because I think struggling with the terminology in this particular topic is common.<p><i>One thing to realize ...is the context of love ...in many evangelical circles</i><p>As a conservative evangelical myself, your explanation of the Christian concept of love is somewhat confusing and contradictory to me.  But putting that aside, I still don&#x27;t see how this student felt &quot;victimized&quot;, unless now any negative feeling or emotion makes one a victim.  Feeling guilty for failing to live up to a standard is a negative feeling, but I don&#x27;t think it makes one a victim (and if it does, then I think the word victim becomes utterly void of meaning).",1448997103

I just finished building my new gaming rig - the only thing left is a GPU which should be coming in the mail pretty soon. The CPU I have, a core i7 4790K, has a pretty decent GPU so I was testing it out the last couple of days. The first game I tried was GTA 5. It ran smoothly (albeit at the lowest possible settings and 720p resolution). I was pretty impressed with the integrated graphics&#x27; performance. Yesterday I tried GTAV out again for a little bit and I observed that it was ... way too choppy and basically unplayable. I couldn&#x27;t figure out the reason why. Then I saw that Thunderbird was the only application that was open aside from Steam and GTAV. I closed it down again and boom, back to consistently high framerates.<p>What is the catch here? Granted I&#x27;m using the integrated graphics that came with the CPU but I have 32 GBs of RAM. What gives!??",1448997065

In JavaScript, using an anonymous function is no different than any other function, and not surprisingly they are ubiquitous. I&#x27;d wager that this is the primary reason that JavaScript is compared to LISP so much more often than Python is. There&#x27;s also the fact that JavaScript functions are all variadic, which also is similar to LISP. Also Python encourages OOP much more than JavaScript.

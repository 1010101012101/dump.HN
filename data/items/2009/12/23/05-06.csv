They don't seem completely neutral though.<p>I think this has the potential to be an area of language that changes quickly, so we all look ignorant in 50 years when our writings are read, similar to how the terms for different races have changed a lot. My grandmother is almost 90 and calls a man of Chinese descent a ""Chinaman"", and I have to say, ""No Grandma, we don't say that any more."" And she's got a bit of a sense of humor, and says, ""I listen to the radio, and they say Irishman, but Chinaman is wrong?"" And I don't know how to answer that, since the Irish got all sorts of hell in the States too, and Irishman used to be derogatory, but now it's not and it's okay usage.

1011624,comment,1011258,1011562,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Moreover, the narrative of sin and redemption is not a coincidence: progressivism (including its environmentalism subset) is not metaphorically a religion; it is a real, living (nontheistic) religion,* the clear intellectual descendant of mainline ecumenical protestant Christianity.<p>I've heard that, but never found a reasonably objective source that references primary sources. I've read a couple pieces: The general gist I got is that North American Christianity split into two basic movements - Fundamentalist Christianity, which emphasized that the Bible was literal and the ancient rites were necessary to be followed, and Progressive Christianity, which said that the Bible was not literal and was more inclusive and open to discussion. But I've not found any primary or objective secondary sources on how this went - you sound knowledgeable, do you happen to know any?<p>> If a nontheistic religion seems like a contradiction in terms, the problem is merely linguistic; English lacks a good word meaning ""all religious beliefs minus the supernatural stuff"".<p>Yes, that I'm very aware of. I've traveled a lot, and you can clearly see that most non-religious people still inherited their basic religious beliefs of their culture. Very few people actively study ethics and come to independent decisions from their peer group - most people inherit their base ethics from their surroundings, and since religions were the way that most people got their ethics for a very long time now, it's mirrored quite well even in non-religious people. People with formerly Confucian surroundings tend to have a very strong family emphasis, which was a fundamental tenet of Confucianism. People with Jewish surroundings tend to get a very strong scholarly emphasis, at least partially descending from the heavy emphasis on Torah studies. Places that had a heavy Christian presence often are more ashamed about sex, pornography, and nudity than places like Africa and Japan which had did not have those same religious views on sex.<p>The fastest growing religions in the world are nontheistic - this will enter common thought in the next 50-100 years as the power of formal religions continues to decrease and more nontheistic religions gain followers. And that's not a bad thing, but you still absolutely need to insulate public servants and scientists from their religious beliefs, lest they impose their morals on their science and law, thus leading to - well, most people are aware of the impact religion had on law and science throughout the ages. It's a little bit of a dangerous time now, because there's no separation of nontheistic churches and the state.",1261546514

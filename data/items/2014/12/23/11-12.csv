This is why PHP 7 introduces the concept of “packed hashtables”.<p>> [...] We keep these useless values around so that buckets always have the same structure, independently of whether or not packing is used. This means that iteration can always use the same code. However we might switch to a “fully packed” structure in the future, where a pure zval array is used if possible.<p>It&#x27;s nice that they&#x27;re starting to consider the fact that &quot;real&quot; arrays are unnecessarily mixed with hashtables, which comes with a pretty significant overhead. Let&#x27;s hope they&#x27;ll soon add that different separate type for arrays (or &quot;fully packed hashtables&quot; if they prefer :)).",1419333929

8787716,comment,8785392,8785884,0,0,Someone,,,"Indeed. Why mix two grammars in one file? Now, that &quot;go generate&quot; call has to parse go (at least up to comments; I think it should ignore &quot;//go:generate&quot; inside multi-line strings), and then parse those comments.<p>I would think it would be way simpler to only allow those special comments in the input file for &quot;go generate&quot;.<p>If I were snarky, I would add that, if this gets used a lot, it might be handy to add dependency information to that file, so that &quot;go generate&quot; can skip repeated work. Once it does that, people can call it every time they compile their code, gaining convenience without much loss of time.<p>I also wonder what the distribution of code will look like. The goal seems to be to shield ordinary programmers from code generation. That is somewhat laudable (I would like to see a &#x27;layered&#x27; language where upper layers are highly similar, but simpler to use and a bit less powerful, but haven&#x27;t seen a good one yet), but at odds with the GPL.

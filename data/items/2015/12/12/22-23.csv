Note that these can both <i>also</i> be described as plain-old &quot;AI research&quot;; they&#x27;re not just abstract philosophy, these papers are steps toward something people can build. The research within the subfield of &quot;friendly&quot; AI just has different criteria for what makes for a &quot;promising avenue of research&quot;, e.g. ignoring black-box solutions because there are no knobs for humans to tweak.<p>> MIRI ... spearheaded by<p>MIRI is two things, and it&#x27;s best to keep them mentally separate. It&#x27;s a research organization, like Bell Labs—and it&#x27;s a nonprofit foundation that funnels money into that research organization.<p>Yudkowsky is the director (head cheerleader) of the nonprofit. He doesn&#x27;t really touch the research organization. The research org will succeed or fail on its merits (mostly whether it hires good researchers), but the leadership of the nonprofit has not-much to do with that success or failure, any more than AT&T had any impact on the success or failure of Bell Labs. You can believe in <i>the research org known as MIRI</i> even if you actively distrust Yudkowsky.",1449961167

I&#x27;ve been fired from 2 jobs this year (having a stellar start, then quickly boring for good). Everything I do seems to be motivated by novelty, it seems like a dangerous addiction now.

10724454,comment,10722266,10722266,0,0,vardump,,,"NUMA systems are annoying for also other reasons. RDTSC is typically CPU socket dependent. Different CPU sockets have different counts. So even with constant TSC (time stamp counter), you can&#x27;t compare TSC values between different sockets. As a workaround, you need to also somehow record the CPU socket information together with timestamp. Which is hard unless you&#x27;re in kernel context. Well, there&#x27;s RDTSCP, but it also requires kernel to load appropriate values to IA32_TSC_AUX MSR.<p>When requesting high precision time stamps, some operating systems fall back to APIC or HPET. The issue is these are 2-3 orders of magnitude slower to query than TSC. TSC takes a few nanoseconds to acquire, APIC / HPET can take a few microseconds, which can sometimes be too much.<p>Thus precision timing and timing sensitive code is somewhat tricky on NUMA systems.<p>Another annoyance is how easy it is to saturate a NUMA interconnect with synchronization traffic.

The utility function may not be perfectly aligned with the values of the human race, which are (at best) very difficult to pin down.<p>&quot;2. Any sufficiently capable intelligent system will prefer to ensure its own continued existence and to acquire physical and computational resources – not for their own sake, but to succeed in its assigned task.&quot;<p>The first of those is what Bostrom calls &quot;perverse instantiation&quot; and Dietterich and Horvitz call the &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; problem (<a href=""http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/10/192386-rise-of-concerns-about-ai/fulltext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/10/192386-rise-of-concern...</a>). The second of these is what Bostrom calls &quot;convergent instrumental goals&quot; and Omohundro calls &quot;basic AI drives.&quot;<p>The first of these seems like a fairly obvious problem, if we think AI systems will ever be trusted with making important decisions. Human goals are complicated, and even a superintelligent system that can easily learn about our goals won&#x27;t necessarily <i>acquire</i> the goals thereby. So solving the AI problem doesn&#x27;t get us a solution to the goal specification problem for free.<p>The second of these also has some intuitive force; <a href=""https://intelligence.org/?p=12234"" rel=""nofollow"">https://intelligence.org/?p=12234</a> shows Omohundro&#x27;s idea can be stated formally, so it&#x27;s not purely sci-fi. Averting the &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; problem in full generality would mean averting this problem, since we&#x27;d then simply be able to give AI systems the right goals and let them go wild. Absent that, if AI systems become much more cognitively capable than humans, we&#x27;ll probably need to actively work on some approach that violates Omohundro&#x27;s assumptions (and the assumptions of the formalism above).

It doesn&#x27;t seem likely that it will be 100% fatal, but with runaway climate problems, you&#x27;re potentially looking at mass flooding, natural disasters, crop failures and starvation, and potentially the collapse of many societies in the ensuing unrest. It seems likely that it will result in large changes in the makeup of vegetation and wildlife, potentially to the point of mass extinction, if the food chains in the oceans and on land break down. Our social systems are not set up to deal with this kind of event, at all. The planet&#x27;s ecology will rebound as it always does, but that happens on timescales not very compatible with human lives.<p>Then again, maybe it will happen slowly enough for us and the ecosystem to adapt. I hope that&#x27;s the case.",1449957923

Thats better than I can do with most traditional diagramming applications. In that way having limited options helps because there&#x27;s less things to get distracted by. Anytime I try to make a diagram in Visio or Omnigraffle I spend (at least) 15 minutes just adjusting fonts, sizing, etc. It ends up being a very frustrating experience. So much so that I&#x27;ve mostly gone back to making paper diagrams.",1449957848

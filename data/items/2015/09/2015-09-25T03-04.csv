While not good, it&#x27;s not the big issue people seem to think they keep discovering.<p>For non-brand advertising this is easily solved by down funnel tracking. Any marketer worth their salt tracks to the &#x27;ultimate goal&#x27; and will avoid shadier networks by results based tracking. End of the day marketing value comes down to a ROMI metric. It doesn&#x27;t matter if 50% of the impressions are fake as long as the total investment pays off. For brand marketing I simply follow the networks that show DM performance as an indicator of quality display.<p>Generally the worse point for junk clicks is mobile display - particularly in app. Id never advise RON campaigns here without tight monitoring. I like to build white lists rather than a black lists for companies where I handle their marketing for display on mobile.<p>Interestingly I&#x27;ve been noticing increasing bot clicks on Google search ads. If I can detect this is makes me really suspicious why Google, with all their data/prowess is not.<p>This would really make interesting reading if someone wants to show this to the world.

Because the www has always had heaps of free content.  Maybe these large sites, Facebook included, know that if they were to charge, most people would not pay.  There might be a backlash.<p>It is silly to pay for ads to be removed when they never had to be there to begin with.  Yes, I remember using search engines before there were ads.

Furthermore, self-checksumming is the root of all good anti-tamper schemes. It prevents someone from automatically patching out your license checks/anti debug/anti jailbreak/whatever. Without self-checksumming, someone can easily patch your app to pirate it, inject a backdoor, or modify it in some unwanted way. So it&#x27;s really a big loss if you care about those kinds of things.<p>Self-checksumming via intrinsics and clever layouts is a very interesting idea, but it&#x27;s impossible for you to checksum a program when you&#x27;re not 100% sure what it will look like after compilation. For example, even if you manage to correctly &#x27;guess&#x27; what machine code your LLVM bitcode would be translated to and adjusted your checksums accordingly, Apple could just update their LLVM bitcode compiler at some point in the future, and invalidate your checksums.<p>Also Android is a much more interesting platform than iOS, because it allows for self-modifying code, which various commercial obfuscators use in various interesting ways :) Also there are very interesting things you can do with reflection or the JNI in Java.",1443150873

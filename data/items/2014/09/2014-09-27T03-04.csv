8375966,comment,8375301,8375844,3,0,cyberpanther,,,"You are probably correct that the Shuttle software was highly reliable and highly complex. But the real failure of the Shuttle was the cost. I think the Shuttle was originally sold to Congress as being able to do 40 missions a year.  We only ever did 4 or 5 a year at most.  The cost was way to high.  And while the software worked flawlessly, the process to create it cost too much.<p>Also the amount of change to the software was relatively low because of the slow bureaucratic process. So you have a high cost for not much change. The computers used in the Shuttle were extremely old towards the end, and because of Moore&#x27;s law, really laughable in terms of processing powering.  Towards the end NASA was using EBay to buy old hardware parts for the Shuttle program.\n<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/12/us/for-parts-nasa-boldly-goes-on-ebay.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/12/us/for-parts-nasa-boldly-g...</a><p>NASA with the Shuttle program didn&#x27;t fight cost and complexity hard enough. Hence you have large groups of engineers to do tasks that can now be handled by better software. Our &quot;Data Group&quot; should have been removed long before the whole program shutdown but half of our department refused to change and use the new simulator.<p>I think Elon Musk gets this with Space X and I believe Space X vehicles already operate at lower costs. Now he just has to prove his reliability and keep becoming more efficient.",1411788326

8375964,comment,8375668,8375668,2,0,userbinator,,,"One difference between plastic and aluminium is that the latter tends to retain deformation more than plastic, which flexes and then returns to its original shape. This is exacerbated by the fact that aluminium cases are usually made much thinner than plastic ones to reduce weight and cost. Also the peak force produced by the impact of e.g. bumping against something with the phone in your pocket could be much more than a constant force of the bend test they used, and easily exceed the elastic limit.<p>If you compare the thickness of the material in an iPhone 5 vs 6 casing, I&#x27;d bet on the latter being somewhat thinner. If that picture of the iPhone 5 is after 150lbs were applied to it, I don&#x27;t see much &quot;case separation&quot;, only a slight bend. It could probably take a bit more force before something catastrophic happened. So it is possible that those used to the robustness of an iPhone 5 are the ones bending their new iPhone 6s.",1411788219

Professionally, this experience has been the most aggravating of my career.<p>Oh, let me tell you about the laziness! One of the developers I worked with would come to work at 11 am every single day and leave at 5 PM—sharp. He would then take a two hour lunch break.<p>It wouldn’t be so bad if he actually did some work, but there was none. I remember vividly this one incident: we were trying hard to meet a deadline and he was responsible for an important component. Every week, he would paint a rosy picture of his progress, saying he was THIS close to finishing the project. The week of the deadline comes and it’s time for him to lay down his cards—and surprise, surprise—there was no working code! All he produced was a jumbling mishmash of code that had no hope of working. \nI spent the next week in the office writing this component.<p>Close to 70 hours. Unreal.<p>[Oh yeah, this guy was getting paid $130K, not to mention those sweet government bennies!]<p>His direct manager would complain about him all the time, and many meetings were asking him to improve his output. And yet, he was never punished. The truth is, when it comes to working at the Federal Reserve, your work output is not as important as who your friends are. And this guy had friends in high(er) places.<p>This guy is just one employee, but I believe it is just endemic of the kind of culture the Fed breeds. One of nepotism, of indolence, of apathy.

If Passenger somehow gets a corrupted environment and calls httpd_infer_envvar then it would trip over Shellshock on an unpatched system.

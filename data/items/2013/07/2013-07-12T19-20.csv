There is no evidence to support feminist mythology surrounding their redefinition of patriarchy.<p>>In the US lack of &quot;father&#x27;s rights&quot; is a red herring.<p>No it is not.  A system that was equal would begin with shared custody as the default, and a case would need to be made to remove either parent&#x27;s custody based on their being unfit.  A system where men are required to spend considerable time and money fighting to get less custody than women get by default is not equal.  The reason men have high success in getting custody when they pursue it is because they almost exclusively pursue it in cases where there is substantial evidence that the mother is grossly unfit.  Have a man talk to a custody lawyer while you listen in.  They will universally tell you not to bother pursuing custody unless you have proof the mother is an addict or has allowed another man to assault the children frequently.  Using selection bias to dismiss valid concerns makes it appear as though you have a vested interest in maintaining inequality.<p>>This because the rates of rape for men overwhelmingly come from prisons and being incarcerated.<p>And those don&#x27;t count because of what?",1373658842

Wile pivoting may make sense, I&#x27;m pretty sure that $300 + 120 days doesn&#x27;t generate enough data to say anything conclusive.</i><p>There was a lot of hubbub before about calling the whole thing a &quot;failure&quot;. I should have made it more clear that I wasn&#x27;t calling it a failure because I spent 4 months and only got one customer. Instead I was calling it a failure because I was no longer interested in what it did, and I had no intention of working on it any longer.<p>> <i>SaaS products like Rakasheets are deceptively expensive for customers. This is good for the SaaS provider. Your middle-priced plan is ~$700 annually</i><p>This is something that I hadn&#x27;t even considered until an actual small business owner sent me feedback saying the exactly that. Previously I thought people were like me, and only considered monthly costs of products unless they were buying an annual plan. It may be that I&#x27;m alone in that.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of how many inventory items I would let each plan track. The smallest plan, which was $29/month, only let a user track 25 inventory items at a time. That&#x27;s a laughably small amount of inventory. I attribute this to not targeting a specific type of customer, but it could also easily be attributed to not thinking it through.<p>> <i>If you&#x27;re low on cash, try direct sales to start. That&#x27;s you on the phone, or sending email. Or getting in your car and driving, if your area warrants it.

That makes it hard to talk to them in person while still holding a 9-5 M-F job.<p>With that in mind, there&#x27;s really no excuse for me to avoid cold calling potential customers.

While some businesses can grow without spending anything on staff, promotions, marketing, etc., that&#x27;s not the norm. Figure out how you can inject more resources into your business. Cash/barter/debt are all viable strategies (although debt is a potential time-bomb.)<p>- <4 months part-time is&#x27;t really enough time to spend on a business before evaluating it as a failure. While pivoting may make sense, I&#x27;m pretty sure that $300 + 120 days doesn&#x27;t generate enough data to say anything conclusive.<p>- SaaS products like Rakasheets are deceptively expensive for customers. This is good for the SaaS provider. Your middle-priced plan is ~$700 annually; factor in low turnover if you do a good job, and you&#x27;re basically selling software in the $1500+ range. Keep this in mind when figuring out how to promote your product. The cheapest promotion channels may not be best for a relatively high-priced (vs consumer-targeted) product.<p>- If you&#x27;re low on cash, try direct sales to start. That&#x27;s you on the phone, or sending email. Or getting in your car and driving, if your area warrants it. If you&#x27;re really offering something that will benefit your prospects&#x27; business, they want to hear from you.<p>Good luck!",1373658093

To use one example from my own experience:  I spend a lot of time coding in a Groovy / Grails environment.  Now, I like Grails and Groovy, but Grails introduces it&#x27;s own weird DSLs for things like:<p>configuring Spring Beans
configuring Log4J
defining URL mappings
configuring Hibernate mappings & queries
etc.<p>Now some of those are cool, but at least some of them replace other techniques that I already know, and find much more readable and understandable.  Configuring Log4J, for example.  I&#x27;d <i>much</i> rather simply jam a log4j.xml in there and forget about the Grails DSL.<p>The thing is, none of these DSL&#x27;s is, in and of itself, necessarily <i>bad</i> in any way... but there&#x27;s a bit of &quot;cognitive overload&quot; in having to deal with 3 or 4 or 5 new DSLs, on top of the base Groovy stuff.  The flip side is, these DSLs mean that your configuration is done mostly in .groovy files and you can use normal groovy syntax for looping and accessing variables, etc.  So it&#x27;s easier to code up more dynamic configurations than if you were using XML files or .ini files.<p>Anyway, the point of this rant is not to say &quot;DSLs are bad&quot; but just to lend weight to the suggestion that they aren&#x27;t universally Good either.",1373657893

Slogans like DRY or SRP seem to blind people to often simple forseeable consequences of their design decisions.<p>Software design boils down roughly to two abilities: one is imagining a great many ways of structuring a program, the other is the understanding of practical consequences of a given program structure. So a good software designer must ask him- or herself: why code repetition is a bad thing? And the answer is that there is absolutely _nothing_ wrong. What is wrong is that a logically or structurally common aspect of the problem didn&#x27;t receive the recognition in the form of an abstraction (a method, class, variable, interface ...). Then you waste time by not being able to reuse this abstraction, when something about this common aspect changes you are forced to go through fifty places and modify the code, but the worst thing is that there is a limit of the amount of details a programmer can keep in his or her head, and the less you are able to structure your program the more restrictive will be limit of the problem complexity you will be able to tackle. That&#x27;s the reason software design is at all important.<p>There are cases however when there is no real logical common denominator to two pieces of code and they are similar practically by accident. It is just as wrong to abstract an accidental similarity as it is not abstract an existing one; soon the requirements change and the abstraction will have to be abandoned, code copied and developed in divergent ways.<p>Finally, people start attempting metaprogramming way before they had learnt enough about structuring programs using basic means, like breaking things down into classes and methods appropriately, data-driving your programs etc. Yes, this is actually a skill, and unless you rewrite some of your own programs 5-10 times and compare their structure you won&#x27;t learn it. I also recommend reading some classical books: SICP, Refactoring, Refactoring To Patterns, Effective Java, Programming Pearls.<p>And the ultimate lessons come from maintaining your own code for a few years.",1373657674

subject.<p>Put more respectfully, beyond my simplistic
(1) and (2), working with <i>causality</i> is
super difficult and quite unpromising
as in mostly just f&#x27;get about it.
For my (3) it boils down to
ways to reject causality
and then we accept causality
once we get so tired trying
to reject it we just give up
and accept it.  Why?  Because
without something detailed and
mechanical, say, from
chemistry, biochemistry, and
the forbiddingly complicated,
detailed biochemistry of cells, 
we are missing anything very
solid to call <i>causal</i>.  E.g.,
in my (1), with the universal joint
that failed, we have a simple
explanation that makes a solid
<i>cause</i>; getting something
so simple and solid for a
cause of cancer from smoking
will be super difficult.  Don&#x27;t
worry, I don&#x27;t smoke, but
neither do I claim really to know
a <i>cause</i> of cancer.<p><i>Causality</i> is a great, intuitive
idea for humans and animals,
but looked at in detail it&#x27;s
tough to establish in all but
some narrow situations.<p>For <i>causal networks</i>, <i>path analysis</i>,
<i>Markov random fields</i>, directed acyclic
graphs, lots of diagrams with circles
and arrows, f&#x27;get about it.<p>For getting <i>causality</i> out of data
analysis, mostly just a fool&#x27;s errand --
f&#x27;get about it.<p>There is a significant reason I concentrated
on (1) something mechanical and (2) something
from classic physics -- those two darned near
cover what can be done with <i>causality</i>.
For the biological sciences -- causality
is really important but really tough.
For the social sciences, they try and
try, and my wife did in her Ph.D. in
essentially mathematical sociology
and my brother did in his Ph.D. in
political science, but, net, watching
my wife and brother struggle with
trying to make causality work in
social science, where it&#x27;s so easy
to make it with (1) and (2), I 
just said f&#x27;get about it.<p>You can entertain my views and my
first very short post as a
contribution to the discussion
based on a lot of background
and a claim that more is a fool&#x27;s
errand or just chalk it up to my ignorance.<p>One more point:  I didn&#x27;t even mention
correlation.  Why?  Because correlation
is so far from causality that it&#x27;s 
hardly worth even mentioning.",1373656948

I see many DSLs as a code smell -- that the runtime environment is <i>almost</i> expressive enough to express the syntax construct the DSL creator wants, but not quite.<p>The implementation of DSLs tends to judiciously use closures, operator overloading, dynamic getters and proxies such that it&#x27;s non-obvious what&#x27;s going on under the hood. Sometimes that trade-off is worth it. Usually it isn&#x27;t, in my experience.<p>I believe (I could be wrong) that DSLs were coined around 2004. I don&#x27;t think that is a long enough history for us to even think about simply accepting that they are a good idea in and of themselves -- garbage collection was invented in 1959 and is still being debated!<p>I see the speed argument all over the internet being presented as a binary argument: either you care about speed or you don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s simply false -- I care about order of magnitudes for speed. I personally don&#x27;t care if I can encode h264 faster in JS than I can another way, but I do care that my event handlers execute within 16ms so I don&#x27;t drop frames in the browser.<p>Some syntax is certainly cute.

Women and trans* folks are far more likely to experience sexual assault and violence compared to men and generally women face systemic issues revolving around family and work that men do not.<p>> Men&#x27;s problems include more severe jail sentences, forced labour, lack of father&#x27;s rights and so on.<p>In the US, its not just men that are more likely to receive jail time, but esp. black and hispanic men. There are systemic issues with racism that perpetuate this problem and this is intersectional with systemic issues with gender. All prisoners suffer from work programs that are essentially indentured servitude and forced work (not sure if that is what you were getting at).<p>In the US lack of &quot;father&#x27;s rights&quot; is a red herring. Men have a high success rate in getting custody in family court when they pursue custody, however men do not pursue custody nearly as often. Also, any kind of bias or discrimination in favor of women in family court is rooted in misogyny in the first place.<p>> Interesting fact: majority of rape victims in USA are male.<p>This because the rates of rape for men overwhelmingly come from prisons and being incarcerated. Further more, this isn&#x27;t really that useful of a thing to say anyway outside of the context of prisoners rights and prison abolition, as women do face high rates of sexual assault and rape and most perpetrators of rape are never convicted.",1373656054

6034443,comment,6032968,6032968,12,0,kgm,,,"Some of these quirks are explained incorrectly. I find the real explanations interesting, so please allow me to provide them.<p>> 999+1 is not 1000<p>The examples given in this section do not actually show what the poster thinks! Python&#x27;s interning of small integers is not relevant. It only applies to integers in the range -5 through 256.<p>The real explanation for why &quot;1000 is 1000&quot; evaluates to True has to do with the Python compiler. By evaluating this expression as a single statement in the interactive interpreter, the compiler notices that the constant value 1000 is repeated more than once. Therefore, it is able to re-use the same object.<p>But if you provide the value in more than one statement, the compiler is unable to do this:<p><pre><code>  >>> a = 256
  >>> b = 256
  >>> a is b
  True
  >>> a = 257
  >>> b = 257
  >>> a is b
  False
</code></pre>
Note that this behavior exists because each statement in the interactive interpreter is compiled separately. If you place the code within a function instead, the entire function is compiled at once, and the object is reused once more:<p><pre><code>  >>> def f():
  ...     a = 257
  ...     b = 257
  ...     return a is b
  ... 
  >>> f()
  True
</code></pre>
> Ellipsis?<p><i>Apparently Ellipsis is always bigger than anything, as opposite to None, which is always smaller than anything.</i><p>Not so. Ellipsis follows Python 2&#x27;s default rules for the comparison of unrelated types.<p><pre><code>  >>> Ellipsis < ()
  True
</code></pre>
The default is documented as comparing objects &quot;consistently but arbitrarily&quot;[1]. The actual rules are:<p>1) None is the smallest object.
2) Followed by numbers.
3) Followed by all other objects. Objects of distinct types are compared by the lexical ordering of their type names.<p>This can easily lead to senseless orderings, when two types define an ordered relationship between themselves, but another type happens to have a name that is lexically between them, as with str, tuple, and unicode:<p><pre><code>  >>> &quot;def&quot; < (1,)
  True
  >>> (1,) < u&quot;abc&quot;
  True
  >>> u&quot;abc&quot; < &quot;def&quot;
  True
</code></pre>
The Ellipsis constant is an instance of a type named &quot;ellipsis&quot;, and so it is smaller than instances of most of the other non-numeric builtin types, except for dict.<p>The actual use of Ellipsis has nothing to do with recursive containers printing an ellipsis in their repr. It&#x27;s part of a wacky special syntax that exists for NumPy&#x27;s benefit:<p><pre><code>  >>> d = {}
  >>> d[...] = None
  >>> d
  {Ellipsis: None}
</code></pre>

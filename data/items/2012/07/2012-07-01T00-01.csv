Some people still working in the industry have gone through a larger increase. I've gone through a 1000 fold myself, and I'm only 25.<p>There are sure to be a whole bunch more we can do to get more capacity, but it's pretty mind blowing to think that the theoretical limits to storage are within our lifetimes on an exponential scale. So as much as Moore's law hasn't failed us yet, it certainly will at some point (probably in the form of the doublings themselves exponentially taking longer and longer).",1341104398

4183366,comment,4182993,4182993,91,0,diskdoctor,,,"I'll start off by saying I'm a closeted entrepreneur in my heart, however by day I've been selling Enterprise Software for 10yrs+.  The latter is what's kept me from doing my own startup for a decade, the income is addictive but the business is not straightforward. To give some context, the average deal size for me is around $250k, but I generally work on large enterprise deals that run $2M+. Two years ago I sold over $70M in software to just two companies, neither Fortune 500.  Needless to say income is substantial in this type of sales where base salaries are easily $100-$150k and you can find yourself earning at least $250k in a slow year, and as good as maybe $1M in a very good one. However, I'm different than most enterprise software sales people. Before selling I spent years programming, architecting systems and continue to work hard to keep my skills up b/c I love this stuff.<p>Marketing and selling software to enterprises is the most dysfunctional cycle of decision making you will ever see in business.  In almost all cases the individuals in the business who actually derive value from the technology are entirely disconnected from those who make the purchasing decisions.  Many times those purchasing decisions are made based on ""perceived"" synergies with other software systems already owned from the same vendor, having never been vetted by the actually consumer in the business.  Enterprises represent a huge market to be served by well designed/functional applications.  Keep in mind that most Enterprise SW contracts have customers paying yearly maintenance charges that are 20% of the original license cost and sometimes more...<p>The thing to understand in selling into this market is you need to adapt your ""logical"" marketing and sales strategy to the way enterprises buy. I say adapt b/c you can't make or help a dysfunctional buyer behave differently.  These companies like centralizing technology decisions, large multi-year commitments and have complex IT accounting considerations. You need to be aware of their existing legacy infrastructures and have a story of how you ""play nice"".  You need to have partnerships with existing large Enterprise SW companies (IBM, HP, Microsoft, Oracle,etc) and you need to have Rolex wearing sales guys who have the connections and can get deals done - <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/13/new-enterprise-customer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/13/new-enterprise-customer/</a><p>If you do all that, just moderately well, a large SW company would swoop you up really fast. They can't innovate new marketable products worth crap, all they do is buy. And although we hear about some of those acquisitions there are many, many more that don't get as much press...<p>However in contrast to the approach above I have been whiteness to a handfull of startup business models that have done really well at infiltrating the enterprise based on their distribution and user engagement model.  Take Yammer for example, their model allowed for people in large companies to start using it (for free) without having to get any approval from their IT departments.  I had a CIO friend of mine who never heard of Yammer until I mentioned and showed him where over 100 of his company employees were already active on it.  Large companies have to worry about compliance, document retention, etc. His first reaction was to block it via the firewall, but then he was smart enough to see it as an opportunity to invest in a technology that had actually been proven to deliver value by people within his own company.  Software or services that can get into the enterprise like a cockroach, breed and spread under the radar have a really good chance of getting a CIO's attention in a good way - it's an opportunity for them to invest in a solution that works and guarantees that their business will get value since its already been proven on an small scale.",1341104254

Store tomatoes are picked hard and green so they will not be bruised during transport. They are then sprayed with nitrogen before being put out so that the skin turns orangish and looks sort of ripe. But it's not ripe, and won't ripen properly since it's a green tomato that was picked long before it was ripe.<p>You can grow the exact same varieties that they sell at the store and allow them to ripen and they will taste considerably better than store bought. This shows that the popular hybrid varieties are not the primary cause of the taste and texture problems.<p>Yes, some varieties of heritage tomatoes will taste even better, due to genetics. But the overwhelming primary issue here is the picking when completely non-ripe.<p>source: decades of growing tomatoes",1341104094

So, I am asking my question here.<p>My story so far: I am in my early 30s. Unmarried. Without house. Without money in bank. Without insurance. I am a software developer. I started freelancing right after graduating from high school. 2 years after graduating from high school, I went to college and got a bachelors degree. Then went for masters degree immediately after getting bachelors degree. Completed first semester. Then got ill severely in second semester. Survived somehow. Dropped out of masters. I was at home on rest for almost 1 year. Went to work for a mid sized software company. Got frustrated after experiencing the corporate politics. Left the company after working for 2 years and started freelancing full time. Freelancing for 6 years. I worked a lot but didn't make much money because most projects are very small. People of my age are married, have children, houses, cars, insurance, cash, good position in companies. I am a loser today. I am nowhere. Is there any way you think I can catch up with people of my age? Can I have a successful career if I start now? What do you suggest? I am not among the smartest guys in the world.

Id been tempted to convert my entire (Django-based) blog over to something like Hyde[1], but wanted a bit more flexibility than the framework provided.<p>In most applications I work on, I lovingly use and abuse Memcached, Redis, and Varnish. If youre working on an application that warrants using a live website and the whole application server shebang, then yes, Id agree with you.<p>But for something like my blog and other non-dynamic websites which dont update very much at all, Im not sure if I see a pressing <i>need</i> for an application server. My blog previously ran varnish-nginx-uwsgi-django, but I was moving off of a VPS and it was the last thing left on that server. I got curious.<p>In the case of something like the L.A. Times Data Desk[2] projects (who use their own django-bakery app), if some views are very expensive/slow to generate, you can offload the work from the application server and do it in advance. (This makes sense if you want to just render everything out on a fast workstation or if you have a local database of several hundred gigabytes that you dont want a live server querying to crunch the data.) Its not out of the question to pregenerate HTML pages, JSON for visualizations, and simple image files (generated in PIL).<p>In any case: its not so much a question of high traffic apps as much as the tradeoff between (computation cost + server maintenance cost) and (app that is server-side dynamic or updates frequently). Most people dont want to configure and maintain an app server (with cache layers and all) for a simple app and those that dont seem to have uptime issues the moment they get any legitimate traffic: see [3].<p>So:<p>* I decided I didnt want to maintain an app server for my blog, and my historical average for updates is about once every four weeks (or even more infrequent).
* People seemed to be big fans of Jekyll/Hyde, Movable Types static publishing mode[4], WP Super Cache, etc.
* I felt a Django-friendly analogue to those would be cool.

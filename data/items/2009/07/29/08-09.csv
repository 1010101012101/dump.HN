729713,comment,729488,729550,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well, there are basically two problems:<p>1. There's enough variation in normal proxy usage that it's difficult to provide a ""one size fits all"" or even a ""one size fits most"" solution.<p>2. Even if you have it set up so that it matches what <i>your</i> proxies do, there's no guarantee that other proxies between yours and the remote user won't mess with stuff.<p>The second one is the real kicker, because it's easy to be lulled into thinking that all you have to do is worry about the proxies you set up yourself. That's not true, of course, and the information you get is still completely untrustworthy.<p>So Django's dropping the middleware, and going forward you'll have to supply your own gun before shooting yourself in the foot :)",1248857779

Very high quality education has been provided free to students by religous, charitable and philthropic foundations for centuries, in most cases far better than what the State (with its obsession with equality over achievement) could provide.<p>Not to mention that in the UK it's been shown that private and State education actually cost about the same per student...

729689,comment,729489,729489,0,0,smakz,,,"IMO Yahoo was never a search company anyway. It was a directory of sites and is better positioned like the article says as a media company. It tried to buy it's way into the search technology market (overture, altavista, inktomi, et al) but they didn't know how to manage and integrate the disparate technologies into one holistic search experience. Yahoo is terrible at managing search technology. Period.<p>It is about time Yahoo stopped pretending to be a search company. Concentrate on growing and monetizing the new media properties they have and they could be very successful. In fact it's the only sane play at this point.",1248856504

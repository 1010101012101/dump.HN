Implicit Euler, as the paper uses, is stable but only first order accurate.<p>If you're dealing with fluids with low diffusion compared to advection, some higher order Runge-Kutta scheme is typically used. For fluids with high diffusion, however, this will give you very high restrictions on the time step. For this cases, a hybrid scheme is often used, where the advection term is integrated explicitly using an Adam-Basforth scheme and the diffusion term is treated semi-implicitly with a Crank-Nicholson scheme. This means you have to solve additional linear equation systems for the velocities for each time step (Helmholtz type equations), but this is still faster since you can use longer time steps.<p>All of this may sound very complicated, but it all follows the same patterns, so it's really fairly straight forward.",1269898958

1227635,comment,1227245,1227245,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"I don't know why we have to rehash this argument all the time.  There are certain problems where the current state of typing technology gets in the way.  These usually involve the UI and testing layers where, for example, you may want to mix together different types that have a common protocol or trait (the Java people call them interfaces).  This is much easier to deal with in languages that let you (or force you to) dynamically bind methods at runtime, like Objective-C and Javascript.<p>Then there's the data-processing-heavy backends where you need to do a lot of parsing, a lot of analytics, a lot of processing, etc...  static typing helps a lot here.  You do not want to make silly stupid mistakes when you're parsing one value to another, and types help make sure you're getting the right inputs and outputs.  When you're doing your metrics, you often don't even want to be accidentally mixing your floats and ints.  If you want to get real fancy about it, monads and functors can help immensely for managing state and joining data for a lot of these backend problems.<p>The folks who don't see this generally haven't had the good luck to work on big problems throughout the stack to see where the strengths of each paradigm come into play.  There's plenty of functional programmers who don't know how to exploit a dynamic language (stop trying to impose types on the system dammit!) and vice versa.",1269898804

I'm also a programming language geek, and have been interested in functional programming languages for quite some time. When I see something like this, however, I loose some of my faith. It just seems like too much effort to get decent speed, and even when not considering speed it doesn't seem to give much benefit. For instance, this is how the diffusion function would look in Fortran (skipping some details):<p><pre><code>  pure function diffusion(x0) result(x)\n\n    real, intent(in), dimension(:,:) :: x0\n    real, intent(out),dimension(:,:) :: x\n\n    x =  x0(2:n+1,1:n  ) & \n      +  x0(0:n-1,1:n  ) &\n      +  x0(1:n  ,2:n+1) &\n      +  x0(1:n  ,0:n-1) &\n      -a*x0(1:n  ,1:n  )\n\n  end function\n</code></pre>\nSome things to note:<p>- The ""pure"" keyword guarantees that this function has no side effects.<p>- No do loops are needed! Fortran array slicing is very handy.<p>- The compiler will convert this to use SIMD instructions<p>- Adding some OpenMP hints to make it run on all cores is also very easy.<p>So this type of code in Fortran is short, very easy to understand and you are guaranteed extreme performance. Maybe functional programming has some benefits when you're dealing with more complex datastructures (for instance I'm working on a code right now which uses parallel octrees, kind off a pain in Fortran), but for simple things like this, I fail to see the point.<p>I want to believe, so perhaps someone here can enlighten me?",1269898519

The company was a bit of a stop-gap for those that could and would handle it, with accommodation, food, and a pretty interesting lifestyle all thrown in.<p>I once found myself in a pub, however, and a homeless guy came up and asked me for a bit of spare change. Having built up a healthy respect for people and torn down my impulse to judge on the basis of only a very small amount of information (from my exp. in said job), I gave the guy what I could when, looking in his eyes, I saw my friend. A guy I had worked with as a fundraiser, who, after a brief spell of bad luck had fallen through the gaps of society and ended up having to constantly climb. I did what I could for the guy, but more importantly he did so much for me - I had never realised destitution was so close (or that the climb back up was so high).<p>Another time I met something I can only describe as otherworldly.... it was almost sacred. Take what you will from it. I was approached (this was while fundraising) by a small, fat, black guy in comfortable, though slightly disheveled clothes in his late 50s or thereabouts. As he came close it occured to me that he didn't exist... I honestly cannot understand the instantaneous clarity of that thought... maybe he was just too much of a cliche for my mind to deal with, but there was something more, an aura that came from somewhere deep within him, from somewhere I don't think I have. He took my hand and started talking to me as though it was the most ordinary things in the world, and he proceeded to tell me about his pebble. He'd been fondling it in his other hand and as I noticed it he started telling me about where he'd found it and all the things that could have been while that pebble had remained hidden. And that, he said, was his point. My pebble was currently hidden, and I was close to finding it. It could be a stone, a coin, a woman or even the world! The point was that it was mine and that it had been sitting, passive, until the day I, and I alone, would come across it and bind myself to it...<p>I don't even know why that's worth sharing with you. Most people I tell, I'm sure, just think I was seduced by the romantic ramblings of a mad old man... maybe so, but I think that moment, myself, the old man and what he said deserve a great deal more dignity, even divinity, than that. I <i>choose</i> to make that moment spiritual (and I'm not by any means ""religious"")....",1269898473

So in addition to housing, Common Ground partners with others to provide health, job, psychological and rehab services. The supportive housing model has been very successful.<p>One of our strategies is outreach, the kind described in this article. The reason we do aggressive outreach is because many of the homeless have been burnt by their past shelter experience so they are resistant to any offers of housing. Obviously, we cant force them to accept housing. But we go to the homeless, day in and day out, and offer them help and its done in the most benign way.<p>We do target other areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

If you get &amp; automatically and have to ask extra hard for a bare ampersand, you've officially gotten me up to ""Hey, wow!"" That's just one metric I use of many, but making the safe thing easy and the dangerous thing harder is a good start!

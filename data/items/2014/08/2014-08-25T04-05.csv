There are at least a dozen of &quot;code anywhere&quot; solution out there and most don&#x27;t solve the core problem which is that we can either write code or run code with very very limited privilege.<p>As both a Github and a Bitbucket user, I can code anywhere I want as long as there is an Internet access. I can edit my files right on the page, or just fire up a new gist on gist.github.com to write a short snippet. I use jsbeautifier.com to make my JS code &quot;prettier&quot; if my code is getting messy. If I have a modern version of Firefox I can even write my Javascript in a scratch pad.<p>The issue is again I don&#x27;t have an environment to run code and use the tools I want to use.

I can buy Hardwood flooring for $6 a sqft and I&#x27;m guaranteed I can buy enough to floor my whole house, better yet I&#x27;m guaranteed I can come back in 6 months and get more. So I can buy enough for my main floor and come back later for my second floor. This is how clothing used to be. You could find a pair of jeans that fit you perfect and 6 months from now you could find the same pair.<p>Or I could go to a discount floorer, I get it at an amazing price $1.25 a sqft. That&#x27;s fucking phenomenal... max 150 sqft because that&#x27;s their entire stock. I can&#x27;t floor my living room with 150 sqft. So to floor my entire house I&#x27;m going to have 8 different styles of hardwood? No. But that&#x27;s what my damn dresser is. I&#x27;ve got jeans that are a dozen different styles and a dozen different fits.<p>I&#x27;ve sworn off retailers because I can&#x27;t wear their jeans for certain activities. I&#x27;ve got a pair that I should have thrown out two years ago because they fit great, but whenever I go to crouch it feels like I&#x27;m going to hulk them because they&#x27;re poorly tailored. So as long as I remain standing in them, I&#x27;m golden.<p>It&#x27;s even worse in shirts. I have a long torso for my height, which means I can&#x27;t let anyone buy me tshirts as gifts. My mum sent me a shirt for my birthday, it hits my bellybutton.<p>The new trend of fast fashion isn&#x27;t an improvement, it&#x27;s turned it into a race to the bottom. Gone are the days you could get quality clothing from any store at any time. Now it&#x27;s bargain hunting in big box stores.

So maybe if you downloaded python 3.0 you&#x27;d just get PyPy with it. There was a lot of hype and hope. And I think at some level the old guard (Guido and some other core developers) saw that as bit of threat and they made public remarks that I understood to mean: &quot;CPython is not PyPy&quot;, &quot;it won&#x27;t be merged in any time soon&quot;, &quot;CPython is fast enough&quot;.<p>So why all this background?

8220628,comment,8219730,8220409,10,0,kabdib,,,"FORTH definitely seemed to be a kook amplifier. It tended to attract personalities who were unhinged and not very disciplined.<p>The episode that most sticks in my mind was when a cow-orker of mine at Atari tried to write a game in FORTH. He blew all his ROM space with runtime and framework and static bitmaps; game play was going to come later, as soon as he got his great FORTH-based game engine running. Ten months into a six month project, 20K into a 16K ROM and with frame times on the order of 5 FPS (utterly unplayable) he basically stopped giving his manager any status, and was fired. All this time, good performance, great game play and small code space were &quot;just around the corner, like next week, maybe&quot; because the magic of FORTH was going to save the day.<p>That was a near total failure of management, good engineering practice, scheduling and hiring, all at once.<p>At nearly the same time, a friend of mine was writing some great process-control stuff for another company, in FORTH. We had many conversations about the Atari programmer in question.  My friend was pragmatic, conscious of his own faults, and probably the best FORTH programmer I&#x27;ve ever known.<p>&quot;Not everyone can handle this stuff,&quot; he said.<p>A few years later I asked him if any of his FORTH code had survived when he left that company, and he smiled a little and asked me what I thought.<p>&quot;They threw it all away, right?&quot;<p>&quot;Right.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know how much that cost the company in question. Probably a lot.<p>In another case, there was a hardware bring-up engineer who wrote a bunch of tests and exercisers in FORTH. This was an initial win because he taught the hardware people FORTH, too, and they wrote a lot of their tests in it, and they were pretty productive. This was unarguably good stuff. But when it came to write native code drivers for the platform&#x27;s OS we found all kinds of cycle-level timing issues that had been masked by FORTH&#x27;s inner interpreter overhead, and I spent weeks chasing some of these, inserting magic NOP instructions to work around glitches.<p>So am I utterly negative about FORTH? No, it&#x27;s a tool. I get really skeptical that you can ship a real product in it, though, and I think that FORTH&#x27;s successes are in very specialized niches and not very visible.<p>Color FORTH made me laugh, though.",1408941530

Long enough that by the time it is built it might not matter because somebody would have built it in node.js, ruby, or python. I really depends on the market.<p>* Type mismatches in a Python program are not the biggest and deadliest bugs. Unit tests and integration tests (that should be there anyway) should catch those well.<p>* Often static type languages that have pointers (C, C++) hide much deadlier and dangerous types of bugs -- pointer bugs like &quot;wild pointers&quot;.<p>* Static type language that don&#x27;t offer protocol checks also can&#x27;t easily detect bugs where you open a file handle,  close it, then read from it. It knows it is a FILE or some iostream but it doesn&#x27;t help much there. I&#x27;ve heard other more advanced languages have something in place to handle that.<p>* The above point coupled with being able to use the REPL on a production system and code has saved significant debugging time. In a complex system there could be an interaction that is hard to reproduce and this one system is in that funky state. Can log in via SSH into it, edit the code to add some debug statements and reproduce it again.<p>In summary, I would like Python to have a standard type annotation syntax that good linters will be able to check for and IDEs will know how to read and use.

This was my habit in my teens, it remains my preferred mode in my 40s.  And while I&#x27;m rarely accused of being highly fashion conscious, I&#x27;m also not a slob (it really doesn&#x27;t take much to have a sense of style).<p>The first time I encountered a wholesale change in fashion was when the Gap discontinued a line of jeans in the late 1980s.  Being naturally gifted with large thighs, an aviator cut worked exceptionally well for me (and yes, I also miss parachute pants and Zoot Suits, thanks for asking).<p>After a bit of casting around, I turned up another store which carried a consistent cut of jeans and wore those through the 1990s and most of the 2000s.  For casual office wear, I&#x27;d discovered a few department and men&#x27;s clothing stores which carried reliable fits.<p>I had a line of black t-shirts with a nice cotton fabric and a subtly off-black color which became a fave.  Much as Steve Jobs bought a lifetime supply of black mock-turtlenecks, I&#x27;d found my shirt for life (but failed to secure a lifetime supply of them at the time, an error in judgment).<p>Pretty much all of that came to a crashing end in 2010.  Numerous vendors changed their sizes -- same brand and size which had previously fit (as evidenced by what was in my wardrobe) now didn&#x27;t, and in ridiculous fashion.  Virtually everything suddenly went &quot;skinny&quot;, which is to say, less fabric, and fabrics became very noticeably cheaper.<p>I first discovered this on one of my grab-and-dash shopping visits:  walk into store, pick up a few pair of jeans and shirts of proven reliable fit, pay, head home (I&#x27;m pretty much the antithesis of a recreational shopper, malls are torture palaces).<p>Pulling on the new duds for work the next morning I discovered I couldn&#x27;t breath.  <i>Everything</i> felt 2-3 sizes too small.  I double-checked sizes, they corresponded with what I&#x27;d bought in the past, pulled existing clothes out of the closet, and returned to the store with my purchases for a full refund <i>as they no longer produced items which fit me</i>.<p>It took over a dozen stops to find jeans and shirts which fit.<p>And given the &quot;fast fashion&quot; fad, I&#x27;ve got absolutely no assurance that I&#x27;ll be able to rely on those vendors in future.<p>Oh, and for those of you suggesting online shopping:  SRSLY?  For clothes, which you wear next to your skin, for which fit, cut, finish, and feel are absolutely crucial?  Thanks, but no.  Worse, with present levels of quality control (and I suspect: highly variable producer sourcing), it&#x27;s not even sufficient to find a style which fits and order a count of those:  you&#x27;ve got to individually try on and examine every last damned item.<p>The result is I&#x27;ve gone from being a reliable customer happy to return to a store repeatedly to one who treats every encounter as a hostile and frustrating experience for which I&#x27;m not likely to achieve anything remotely resembling satisfaction.<p>I&#x27;ve considered custom tailoring, though I&#x27;ve not gone that route yet, for shirts and slacks.  Though as I mostly wear t-shirts and jeans, the additional cost is tremendous.  It&#x27;s actually <i>not</i> so bad for some tailors I&#x27;ve explored, though the one I&#x27;d earmarked for future items appears to have gone out of business, and of course, I&#x27;d have needed to first see what they&#x27;d produce (with ~6 weeks turnaround) rather than simply buying something off the rack and having it altered (which has worked in the past).<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is why with all the supposed advances in personalization, there isn&#x27;t an <i>affordable</i> and <i>readily accessible, brick-and-mortar</i> service by which people can specify the clothes they want, have measurements taken, and receive (with a satisfaction guarantee) clothes which actually fit.  There&#x27;ve been some noises about this in past, and there are &quot;made to measure&quot; (which is <i>not</i> the same as bespoke) &quot;pop-up&quot; tailors such as Indochino -- the one time I&#x27;d found them in real life it was an absolute zoo with ~60 minute wait simply to get into the storefront for measurement.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is &quot;ripe for disruption&quot;, but it&#x27;s certainly rife with disappointment.",1408940274

Airport security <i>does</i> stop security threats - it raises the bar considerably. There&#x27;s definitely an argument that current security is way over the top in the US, but the opposite extreme is even more silly. The moderate path is the way forward - it does not follow that all security measures are security theater.<p>All the arguments about &#x27;what about blowing up trains/buses/whatever&#x27; also miss vital points - namely, that the passengers on a plane cannot escape, and small damage to a plane can doom it. This is not true of trains or buses. Combine this with the point that the public, rightly or wrongly, are more significantly affected by a plane crash, and it becomes clearer why planes are better targets for terrorism. Similarly, the demographic that uses planes are largely middle-class. Those who use public transport have a much larger proportion of working-class people on them, who have less political power, and the media also cares less about them.<p>You also still have to face the issue of running your own terminals, because any international airport has its sterile zone, which is connected to every other international airport in the world. Until you get them all accepting your citizenry carrying weaponry, your local international airport is going to keep its sterile zones. And running your own terminals is going to cost you more than $5 extra/ticket...<p><i>Because I trust that on average, by and large, my fellow passengers are competent and well-meaning people.</i><p>&#x27;On average&#x27; is the problem here.

Anyone who&#x27;s had a job facing the general public will be aware that there are plenty of people who fuck with you <i>just because they can</i>. Particularly in an enclosed environment where people sometimes get heavily inebriated.<p>And regarding the skydiving, light aircraft have only rarely been used for terrorism. The same is very much not true of heavy aircraft, which have a long track record of terrorism.<p><i>The specific threat that modern &quot;airport security&quot; is designed to stop is essentially nonexistent.</i><p>Ultimately, this is a chicken-and-egg problem. Hijacking has been made extremely difficult by the current measures, but even before 9/11, hijacking was much more difficult in the 90s than in the 70s due to increasing the bar for security. The threat is there, but higher security means you have to be better-resourced in order to defeat it.<p>Perhaps put another way: if there is actually no threat, then why do you say you&#x27;d feel safer if your fellow passengers were armed?

But there&#x27;s nothing preventing such equivalents from being standardized; it just won&#x27;t be part of Wayland, since Wayland also wants to target use cases where such things would be inapplicable. If there ends up being a proliferation of wayland implementations that support pluggable components, I think we&#x27;ll definitely see some quick standardization of the necessary interfaces. But at the moment people are still working on successfully using one desktop environment at a time, so good support for the mashups will have to wait.",1408939641

Presumably functionally equivalent to HTML image maps? There don&#x27;t seem to be accessibility features.<p>2. Multiple images which are overlaid on each other to produce the final image. These overlays can be true color, bitmapped, or palette based, kind of like DjVu.<p>The image layers kind of remind me of MPEG-4&#x27;s Video Object Planes. That&#x27;s a bad thing. No one ever figured out a reasonably fast method to segment video into overlaid objects without manual intervention. It&#x27;s cool that your image format has this feature, but if the encoder can&#x27;t make use of it, what&#x27;s the point?<p>3. Multi-resolution encoding\nPNG and JPEG already have interlaced encoding. I can&#x27;t tell how yours is different, aside from being less efficient.<p>4. Images with holes\n.... how is this an improvement over alpha layers?<p>5. Manual compression with a C# gui\nIf you&#x27;re going to do this, why not redraw your image as SVG instead?<p>In summary, it&#x27;s an interesting set of features, but I really can&#x27;t tell the use case you are targeting. In addition, it seems that many of your features already exist in other formats. Maybe you should retarget this as being a simple scene graph builder for Javascript instead of an image format?",1408939316

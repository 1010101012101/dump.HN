Popular, classical, jazz, anything goes, as long as it is really special to you.<p>To kick it off, here are mine:<p>Pat Metheny, The Dream of the Return<p>October Project, Ariel<p>Ralph Towner, The Silence of a Candle",1273057154
1320803,comment,1320668,1320729,0,0,fh,,,"I think WoW has to do that because it's a very complicated interface with roots in the text-based MUDs of old (for example the combat log). I don't consider it an example of good UI/tutorial design.<p>Valve's Portal is how game tutorials should be done in my opinion. It introduces an unfamiliar game element (the wormhole gun) gradually: first you walk through pre-made wormholes, then you get to shoot one of the two wormhole entrances, and only then both of them. Even when you have the full portal gun, you get taught the various tricks (like accelerating by falling into a portal) one at a time. None of this is explained by a wall of text, rather, the level design itself suggests the only possible solution. This is all done so subtly that it hardly feels like a tutorial at all. In fact, for the player, the levels just get gradually harder and require you to combine more and more of the skills and tricks you've figured out earlier.<p>It works brilliantly, and makes for a much stronger experience than any of the text or voice based game tutorials I've seen so far.",1273057122

1320771,comment,1317530,1317530,0,0,pilib,,,"When I started in IT field (support/sysadmin), I was advised that I should hold my positions for 2-5 years, and avoid job-hopping, cause it looks bad on the resume.<p>Fast forward 6 years, I quit my job, why? I started in tech support. I've worked night shifts, weekends, crazy schedules when someone was a on a leave or vacation. No compensation for it, crappy salary, little or no bonuses, night time work and weekend work was not paid according to the law in my country (no-one to complain about it, unfortunately). I kept working there because there was no better offer available, the team I worked in was made of great people, there was some promotion plans for me, and I had a loan to pay off.\nI got promoted. OK, so now I'm a sysadmin, better salary, but still no compensation for working over-time, doing half-month rotation on-call standby if something brakes (and it did), etc. Please mind that the better salary was not a good one, just better.\nAnyways, one of my fellow sysadmins gets called into active service (obligatory in my country), and I get stuck with constant on-call duty, same salary and again, little or no bonuses. This is where I start looking for options, and I after getting accepted at few other places, I decide to stay where I am, why? Better tech, more complicated work, challenging, etc.\nA year later I discover that no social service, pension plans and med-care payments were made by my company for me or other people for the last 5 or 6 years ( in my country, the company pays for it, and it isn't quite easy for you to check that on a monthly bases), and I get net income, so I actually don't care about my gross income. I raise hell, and after a few clashes with local and upper management I decide to get the hell out of there.<p>So, in the end, my two cents are: Loyalty, to the company, friends, team at work, family, girlfriends, etc. has to be something that is deserved on their part, not expected from day one. Dedication and commitment should not be confused with it.<p>Anyways, I'm now freelancing, and working towards my degree in soft. engineering.",1273055245

There's even been a lot of debate about that here lately (Mahalo is very profitable; is it providing any value to anyone but its owners?). One can also do a lot of great stuff, and also get rich doing it. Or, one could produce tons of value for other people, and <i>not</i> get rich doing it, like the collective editors of Wikipedia, volunteer contributors to thousands of open-source projects, and many scientists who publish their work freely have. I'm not sure how well the two ideas correlate overall, really.<p>I'd hazard a guess that they correlate reasonably well up to some point (most people making $150k have probably produced better stuff than most people making $50k, with exceptions on both sides), but get wildly erratic past some cutoff, where it becomes more an issue of connections with other businessmen and government, and the feedback loop of ""you need money to make money"".

I built a robot last night (runs on Lisp and parts from Radio Shack) that constantly monitors the internet, my phone lines and packets going out of YC's office. As soon as my robot picks up a signal of interest it beams the messages directly to my HUD that I've been wearing ever since I sent my app in.",1176220186

Therefore your comment does not reflect reality.<p>I'm sure that's true in the city where you live, but come to Dalton, NH and tell me again how I'm supposed to get high speed access.  DSL? Nope.

11295,comment,11208,11208,0,0,Mistone,,,"lets dream for a minute - 
All things even, I would prefer Microsoft over Yahoo, but likely go with Google over both.  Even better would be a slightly smaller, more focused player like SalesForce.com. It seems that Yahoo has a tendency to sap a startup of all it's mojo, while Google is fairly effective at buying a feature/product and quickly integrating it into their suite.  <p>Microsoft has done well with some, and dropped the ball on others, but the embedded reach and business focus would be a huge value add to our business.

11292,comment,11292,9770,0,0,scd,,,"Two comments:<p>1) I think you underestimate the importance of Firefox in Microsoft's decline in importance. It is Firefox that makes sure that all those Web-based apps aren't held hostage to Microsoft's implementation of web standards.<p>2) Whilst its all about the web it isn't all about the browser. Ajax-y web apps show the potential for ignoring platform specific APIs (such as Win32)--especially when you don't try to mimic platform specific behaviour (the big problem with Swing-based apps: stop pretending to be a native desktop app! Rejoice in being a x-platform web app!). But ajax inside Firefox/Safari isn't going to be enough for me to abandon all of my 'rich' Mac OS X apps: if you want me to put all of my brain in your web-based wiki or PIM, give the same 'richness' and sophistication of design that I can get with VoodooPad, DevonThink, and Curio.

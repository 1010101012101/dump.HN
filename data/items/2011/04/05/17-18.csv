Thus, all you chose is a 'major' (the degree) and the rest (the subjects and curriculum) has been chosen for you by the college.<p>Most of the times a student's major is selected for him/her with the following preference:<p>1. What's available in the most reputed college nearby.\n2. What the parents perceive to be the best degree to pursue (usually engineers/doctors followed by other streams based on the general consensus of their friends/peers/relatives).<p>Children almost never decide their own focus - at least they never did say about ten years ago. Children here make the first choice of their courses to study in High School when they are 16. That's almost too young to decide what you want to be.<p>You can be certain that almost every Indian student who took Biology in their High School tried to be a doctor and every student who had Maths and Physics took the exams for entrance to Engineering colleges.<p>That's why we see Indian engineers have a very skewed quality to quantity ratio - many of them never wanted to be engineers in the first place!<p>This can mostly be attributed to our parents growing up in an (almost) socialist republic where doctors and engineers were the best career avenues after the government. However, things are changing slowly and parents are being very liberal with the career choices of their kids and getting them to explore different options.",1302026230

Using the algorithms we've come up with so far, TSP of the complete graph of 4000 points, or even Euclidean TSP of 4000 points, is intractable except in special cases.<p>We don't have a proof that there's no tractable or efficient algorithm. We have evidence in the form of an NP-completeness proof, but although unlikely, it's possible that P=NP and there's an efficient algorithm for TSP.<p>As far as we know, it's possible that a computer doing some kind of search for algorithms  genetic programming is the sexiest kind of search, but of course not the only one  could find such an algorithm.  We just don't have any idea. One of the consequences of the unresolved status of the P=NP conjecture and the infancy of AGI is that we can make very few statements about the capabilities of yet-undiscovered algorithms, or how easy or hard they are to discover.<p>> Remember, solving the traveling salesman problem is easy/trivial, it's finding the shortest/optimal path that's hard.<p>You're quibbling about technicalities, and you happen to be wrong about them. Formally, TSP is a decision problem: whether there exists a path shorter than a given length L. That's not ""easy/trivial"".  As far as we know, it's as hard as computing the shortest path.

I guess it's mostly like a library of patterns for socket usage, so it makes a request-response loop and pub-sub scenarios really easy to implement. The other thing that's great is that it's pretty much programming language agnostic, meaning that C++ code and Python code look fairly similar and can trivially be used together.<p>As for the transparent queueing, there are simple options to control the size of the queue; it's even possible to spool the queue to disk as soon as the memory limit is reached (see setsockopt docs and look for HWM, for high water mark).",1302024228

And as far as I know, copyright had nothing to do with the ad being rejected. My theory as expressed in the article was that it was the effectiveness of the picture, not copyright, that caused the problem. After all, I got the image from reading an article about posting ads on Facebook. In that article it showed several FB ads with this image on it. I thought that if the article was about posting ads, and this image was included, then there was some implied warranty. Like I said, I'm not trying to make excuses, simply explain. At the time I wasn't too terribly interested in the providence of the image, simply learning how all the pieces come together for an intended effect. Having said that, I'm perfectly happy with using the image in a blog article about the image itself -- if that's not fair use I don't know what is.<p>As of right this minute, none of us know who this person is or what kinds of protections are involved. Since I have received multiple claims to know who she is, and since they are all different people, I believe it is reasonable to expect that the image is of insufficient resolution as to be identifying of any one particular person. So -- unless something changes -- we can never really <i>know</i>, at least in the fashion you indicate. There is a huge amount of material on the web that falls into this area, and a lot of murky edge cases. For instance, FB thinks it is okay to post the same image on my website's fan page, even though FB runs ads on those pages? FB can use the image for it's commercial purposes but I can't use it for mine? All those ""memeish of images"" you refer to -- much of it on FB feeds -- isn't an issue for FB for purposes of placing their own ads?<p>There seems to be some serious inconsistencies here. I'm probably in error, so I apologize to whomever I might have offended. But I am not happy at all that I understand the current state of things to the degree necessary. I don't think anybody does -- I think at the end of the day it's a personal evaluation of risk. I'm also not happy that I wouldn't inadvertently do the same thing again -- that I'm not, in fact, doing it right now, by sharing funny pictures I find with my friends on FB.<p>That's really screwed up.<p>I could argue on and on about this -- but I have no desire to do so, or to use the image in an ad. I strongly feel that some folks would have taken that risk, and that it is a reasonable decision to make, and it bothers me that so many people would let their judgment of what's too much risk for them be the rule for everybody else.",1302023792

2411774,comment,2411289,2411289,17,0,haberman,,,"Can't watch the video right away, but I'll just say that every time I read the ZeroMQ guide (<a href=""http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all</a>) I am frustrated by the lack of any clear technical explanation of ZeroMQ's basic architecture.<p>Today I gave it another shot, and after half an hour of trying to glean technical detail and skipping any parts that read like a like a comic book (""zap-pow-kaboom satori paradigm-shift moment""), I think I've learned the following:<p><pre><code>    * ZMQ works by spawning a background thread that runs a\n      poll() (or equivalent)-based async I/O loop.  This thread\n      is created when you create a ZMQ ""context.""\n\n    * On top of a context you can create a ZMQ ""socket"", which\n      may map to N underlying UNIX sockets (or a comparable\n      transport), and which will transparently queue data to slow\n      or unavailable receivers.\n\n    * Over a socket you can send or receive ""messages"", which\n      are length-delimited strings which are always delivered\n      in full with the original length. Send/receive can be\n      either blocking or non-blocking.\n\n    * Contexts can be shared across threads, but sockets are\n      not thread-safe.  Communication between application threads\n      and the ZMQ I/O thread is via a lock-free queue.\n</code></pre>\nThe main features seem to be topology-agnostic programming (since you don't have to know what a socket is connected to to send/receive over it) and transparent queuing.  In my opinion transparent queues can be problematic because they transparently use up memory that can be hard to account for.  Topology-agnostic programming certainly seems interesting, but in my experience of distributed systems programming I never seem to need or want complex messaging topologies.  I guess I don't really get what all the hype is about.  Maybe I should watch the video.",1302023705

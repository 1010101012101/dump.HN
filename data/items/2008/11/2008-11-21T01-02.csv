It's probably that in all of these cases Google was trying to do maximize their own profits.<p>It probably just weighed the odds and decided, in those cases where it went to trial, that it was better to try to win the case than pay a huge settlement check. In the Author's Guild suit, they probably realized they had little chance of winning and the results of a loss would be incredibly costly.<p>It's a mistake to assume a corporation is (or should be) trying to fight for innovation rather than to maximize their own profit.

Whether they decide to automate depends on a need to save money where possible, not survive in a marketplace.<p>Second, you just reaffirmed my point. You are confusing productivity with labor value. By writing a script, you've revolutionized the production of obtaining standard investing data. As such, it requires even less labor. In fact, it now requires no labor, since a machine without any human intervention (save for negligible maintenance costs) can do the job! Why should anyone be paid to--according to what you described above--to do nothing. It's all automated. Now, if investment firm B (my firm) wants to compete, it will have to do the same, since it is spending $X amount to collect the data, while your firm spends $0. This is a pointless cost. As such, it will be forced to do the same to stay in business. Now, firm B no longer requires a warm body to perform the aforementioned task, i.e. it no longer employs someone to enter data. How does not employing someone generate wages for them?<p>By writing your own script, you cancel out your own employment. While true, that the writing of the ""awesome"" Web 2.0 app (I love yc news, it's full of this stuff) will absorb a fixed amount of labor, thus keeping you employed for the duration of writing it. Once it is completed though, you will be made obsolete. You essentially, wrote your own death sentence. Now don't this is a misguided Luddite speaking, I am a programmer too, and I can sympathize.<p>I want to keep up this discussion.",1227231766

I don't think justin.tv did anything wrong but if you can sue McDonalds for making coffee too hot you definitely have a shot at this.

</code></pre>
Remove the ""purchasing a service"" element out of the equation and this still holds up -- the temptation to put money aside in bitcoins is still there.<p>As the service is a month-to-month thing, there's a limit on the amount of time you can wait if you did purchase by bitcoins. Also, if the price of bitcoins is going up, it's encouraging customers to pay earlier and earlier which is a good thing as most customers seem to wait until the last day (but server bills come up before then...).",1307616723

2636583,comment,2634289,2634289,1,0,babul,,,"Being originally from a background and area where this is rife, I can only offer the following:<p>1. Change your mindset - Positive things happen to positive people, as basically they envision the positive result they want and engineer (either consciously or subconsciously) towards it. Negative people think they will always fail, hence don't try, hence fail, and vicious self-reinforcing circle repeats. This is hard to to when depressed, hence why you need to to change lifestyle as per following as example.<p>2. Take any job - It's not about doing something you love or pays well, but getting out of the house and changing your environment. A fresh/different perspective, new scenery, fresh air, and interacting with other (different) people always helps. It can also help you find structure and (different) routine in your life.<p>3. Focus on one change at a time - Thinking about everything at once can be overwhelming. Try and make one change at a time. Do the easiest (most achievable) things first. Success at them will make you feel good and help as building block to next (harder) thing.<p>4. Don't worry about external opinions of nay sayers - You are not in competition with others, only yourself, so as hard as it may be, focus on your path at the pace you are happy with and ignore what others say. The key thing is you keep moving forward, positively, even if only one step each day. Once you stop standing, and start moving, you will inevitably make progress, and that progress will help you move more.<p>5. Build income - Inevitably money is the cornerstone to fixing many problems in life, and with an income that meets your base needs, you may then be afforded the opportunity to do things you want to do, not have to. This could be something like hiring a carer a few days/hours a week so you have time to do something you want e.g. build your skills/portfolio/resume for a future step of a new/better job.<p>6. Do not be emotionally black mailed or feel guilt for wanting to live your life - We all have our paths to walk in this life and sadly there are people that will put you down or try to stop you for no good reason (i.e. your path is not self-destructive such as drug abuse) and its to do with what they want rather than what is best for you. No matter how hard it is to say this, or resentment parents/family may feel, but they have lived their lives and made their choices. You must live yours and make yours, even if in the immediate term it upsets people. In due time, most people realise things were for the good and the initial negative reaction such family has is more about the change itself rather than why/what change is for. One way to smooth this is to give people notice so change is not unexpected i.e. tell them you are telling them, tell them, tell them you told them, do it.",1307615221

2636570,comment,2636078,2636078,6,0,thomasz,,,"A little bit off topic: I was curious if you can really do something with bitcoins aside from speculation. It turns out that there are some places that accept bitcoins. But it seems that actually _using_ bitcoins as a currency instead of a speculative asset doesn't seem like a good idea right now:<p>The sites seem to either try to adjust prices often, or don't. The sites that don't are hopelessly overpriced: Let's say I want the biggest vps for sale at <a href=""http://lightfoot.dashjr.org/?page=vps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lightfoot.dashjr.org/?page=vps</a> . I can either go through the hassle of buying 49 bitcoins for ~1450$ at mtgox to pay for the vps, or I could pay 118$ directly. Even the sites that adjust the price have a huge problem: If I convert dollars to bitcoins, I would be tempted to wait a couple of days and sell on mtgox and then buy the service with dollars.<p>So, buying stuff with bitcoins is not the best idea right now. If you want to do something with bitcoins, buy them and sell them at a higher exchange rate later. The only problem is that we all know that this can't go on forever. Therefore, the exchange rate is bound to go down sooner or later. If that happens, we would be in a mirror inverted situation: Selling stuff for bitcoins would suck. Prices would have to reflect the overhead of continuously adjusting prices and converting bitcoins, putting them at a disadvantage against ""real"" currency.<p>Price instability is poisonous for a currency. Some aspects of bitcoins lead to excessive speculation, and therefore, prices will always be unstable, therefore, there is no incentive to use bitcoins as a way to buy or sell (legal) goods.",1307614620

I&#x27;d say learn your databases, CSS and then maybe pick up Ruby and C# (in that order).  Employers are typically looking for accomplishments, i.e. projects you&#x27;ve created or worked on rather than just a list of languages.  If the job calls for a language you don&#x27;t know, buy that language&#x27;s reference manual, learn it, and then say you know it.  Once you&#x27;ve picked up one language, other ones are usually just a matter of syntax.<p>The Systems Programming side of things is different, of course.  I&#x27;m a mechanical engineer by training so as a consequence I know some embedded languages like Assembly for certain chips, Tcl, as well as C/C++ and a little bit of Fortran.  If you stay on the web side it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll encounter these very often.  My Javascript kung-fu is weak because I pretty much never do web stuff.<p>It&#x27;s all about having a relevant portfolio of demonstrable skills.",1400054399

7742672,comment,7742221,7742633,1,0,masklinn,,,"> Languages that support algebraic data types have a much better solution.<p>Which I mentioned in my original comment…<p>> You can explicitly declare which types can occur and it can be &quot;A or B&quot;. It&#x27;s called ADTs and it&#x27;s the real solution to these problems.<p>Well no actually, an ADT is a single type with multiple data-divergent constructors (although GADT may fit the bill, maybe with datakinds, I&#x27;ve yet to understand those).<p>In `data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)`, the only type is List. Which is why I specifically noted that a <i>closed</i> set was necessary for tagged unions. There are languages which safely[0] handle actual type unions (genuine type coproducts), they are much rarer than types supporting simple tagged unions. IIRC, /u/munificent did a post on that for his magpie language although I don&#x27;t remember if he ever implemented it. David Pierce&#x27;s Whiley also seems to use type unions[1]<p>[0] an important discriminant, C has unions but they&#x27;re not memory — let alone type — safe.<p>[1] <a href=""http://whiley.org/2013/07/31/understanding-why-union-types-are-useful/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whiley.org/2013/07/31/understanding-why-union-types-a...</a>",1400054024

Even more so if you can utilize SIMD instructions. I know what I wrote wasn&#x27;t clear on this, I was writing it in a hurry, sorry about that.<p>The reason I talk in cache lines, is because it&#x27;s taking the real world aspect into the analysis of the algorithm. A theoretical analysis, while valuable in some aspects, are very far from the real world scenarios. I have done countless theoretical analysis of algorithms, found the actual (hidden) constants in big-O ect. but it just doesn&#x27;t model the real world very well. This is the exact reason you see many fast algorithms use a naive, but cache friendly algorithm once the input is sufficiently small (e.g. with a divide and conquer algorithm).",1400054000

While American-made computers, cars, steel and tools struggle against foreign competition, Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, and Mickey Mouse are cleaning up. American pop culture is just about the biggest export the U.S. produces. For better or worse, it&#x27;s literally everywhere. Every backroads world traveler has a favorite story about being lost, hungry, and hundreds of miles off the edge of any map when a friendly native suddenly appears to lead him to a hut.

Here&#x27;s an idea you should definitely look into (if it&#x27;s not you, I&#x27;ll look into it when I finish my studies).<p>I spent countless hours reading articles all over the place, only to find most of them are the utter shit imaginable, you wonder how they even get published.<p>I am sure that, around the world, many people are like me, preparing a thesis or something.. So this shit gets read a whole lot of time, when it should in fact collect electronic dust on a long forgotten server, until it commits suicide.<p>Also, anyone preparing some work has to go over that to do a &quot;State of the Art&quot;... Where&#x27;s the field at right now..<p>This work gets repeated. Why wouldn&#x27;t it be done once every time an industry is moved forward, so you just pick up there and bring your improvements, instead of reinventing the wheel every time.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;something&quot; where academic articles are reviewed, and I don&#x27;t mean &quot;peer reviewed articles&quot; and what not.. More like Amazon with books: Readers write what they think the book is lacking, or is not.<p>You can search for the article, and it displays reviews..<p>This is because in many articles, the authors are major assholes abusing keywords: They include keywords, you read the article to find that they really only had one sentence talking about it.<p>They pack it with keywords in the hopes of getting searched for.<p>It can be a client for example, peer to peer.<p>You install your client, you choose some themes and keywords you are interested in.. And then each time you start-up, it shows &quot;relevant articles&quot; for you to read and review.<p>It&#x27;ll help you stay updated on a current industry, a particular branch of an industry, etc..",1400053514

7742650,comment,7742221,7742499,2,0,oelmekki,,,"> In my opinion, there is nothing interesting in Go, and it doesn&#x27;t seem like a language I would want to use.<p>I take it you&#x27;re a C/C++ developer ? As a ruby developer, go got my interest like other compiled languages could not, and the reason for that has be pointed out by Rob Pike in his keynote at gophercon[1] : productivity.<p>I&#x27;m used to a certain pace of development with interpreted languages that compiled languages just can&#x27;t match. And well, time is money, I&#x27;ll use a &quot;slower to write with&quot; language only on critical piece of software where something else won&#x27;t do. Go has been a perfect fit, here : it allows to do more heavy processing while still being acceptably fast to develop.<p>Other than that, its main advantage is what it has been created for to begin with : concurrency. It&#x27;s a core concept, meaning you can express it with simple syntax (with goroutines and channels) and that you don&#x27;t have to fear hitting limits (goroutines are not threads exactly, go do its best to map them on available threads, as much as there are cores, and you can thus have ten of thousands of goroutines running concurrently with no problem).<p>There are probably languages that go further on concurrency, like erlang, but go is just the perfect balance between ease of learning, speed to develop, ease of implementing concurrent code and speed of execution.<p>[1] <a href=""http://confreaks.com/videos/3419-gophercon2014-opening-day-keynote"" rel=""nofollow"">http://confreaks.com/videos/3419-gophercon2014-opening-day-k...</a>",1400053383

7742620,comment,7741564,7742585,3,0,Jach,,,"Basically, yeah. Since this only applies to single player, if it doesn&#x27;t affect your personal enjoyment (or if it can actually increase it), why care that it&#x27;s cheating? Personally I find victories with a lot of reloading / other methods of cheating somewhat hollow, so I try to avoid it. Except sometimes I just want to advance the storyline and try a different scenario, maybe come back to that pain-in-the-ass one later (it&#x27;s especially great to do that when you have a &#x27;eureka&#x27; moment in general strategy that you find out in later scenarios). Or in Wesnoth specifically, I think there are some campaigns that are just about unwinnable <i>even with</i> gratuitous reloading unless you did particularly well on the previous N scenarios; I don&#x27;t want to waste time replaying previous scenarios that I didn&#x27;t do so great on but that I still won, at least not so soon. That would just decrease my enjoyment of the game.<p>Also in a sense save points are a cheat -- back in the Ikaruga and Contra 3 and Asteroids days, if you lost, you lost! Start over. Great fun for me at least. :) Now we have saves, and the enjoyment of the game comes from other areas besides committing to muscle memory a movement sequence that beats a level with a certain score, and someone opposed to saves can always just not save or not load from an autosave...

But for only $50 difference, Moto G seems the better choice. Maybe my expectations were unrealistic, but I actually thought they could manage to put this one at $99, especially once I saw a rumor that it will sell for $117 in India. Moto G also started at about 17 percent in India more than in US ($210), so I logically deduced in US it would be $99.<p><a href=""http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/motorola-launches-moto-e-prices-it-at-rs-6999-makes-it-available-exclusively-on-flipkart/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/moto...</a><p>Moto G had a GREAT price at $179 ($210-$240 elsewhere), and why it became so popular in the first place. It doesn&#x27;t quite look that Moto E has the same type of great price for what it offers. $99 would&#x27;ve been that great price that would&#x27;ve made everyone recommend it as the default choice for the price range.<p>If the rumor about the price in India was right, and it won&#x27;t actually be more like $150 now there, then perhaps they are trying to have a more &quot;global&quot; price, where it&#x27;s more or less the same price everywhere, even in US, and this way they&#x27;d make little profit on the global versions, but more profit in US.<p>As for the specs, I&#x27;m a little disappointed it comes with Cortex A5 instead of A7, but since it&#x27;s clocked 200 mhz higher than Cortex A7 would be, maybe it&#x27;s not too big of a problem, especially since they claim the general performance of the device is faster than a Galaxy S4 in many situations (like opening apps, which I think has more to do with their use of the F2FS file system, which ironically is made by Samsung, but they aren&#x27;t using it themselves).<p>I also told my little brother if he&#x27;d want one of these, and he asked me if it has flash, and was disappointed to hear it does not.

7742606,comment,7742221,7742512,2,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"They are pretty contemporary, from the 2003 Moby paper:<p>> The main differences stem from a fundamental design choice: OCAML’s design emphasizes the expressiveness of the object-type system, whereas MOBY’s design emphasizes the expressiveness of the class system. OCAML uses row polymorphism [R´em94] to support extensible object types, whereas MOBY uses structural subtyping. OCAML’s approach has two advantages: it is backward compatible with ML’s Hindley-Milner type inference, and one can get the effect of mytype by the use of recursive type variables. The cost of providing mytype is that OCAML’s classes are less flexible than MOBY’s. Specifically, if a method is public in an OCAML class, it cannot be hidden from either class clients or object clients of a deriving class, as required for the soundness of mytype. In addition, if a method is hidden from object clients in a class, it cannot be made public by a deriving class. The former restriction means that the class hierarchy determines an object-type hierarchy. These restrictions, along with the fact that OCAML does not have public fields, limit one’s ability to use the module system to implement friends via package scope in two ways. First, it is not possible to reveal inherited protected methods or fields to the friend functions, and any method that a class reveals to its friends must also be revealed to any client outside the module (assuming that the class is exported).",1400052028

An undergraduate SDE class really is &quot;unimaginable&quot; most places, and learning the material from a textbook would be impossible -- it&#x27;s too difficult and appropriate textbooks don&#x27;t exist. The &quot;textbook&quot; is usually the instructor&#x27;s notes from the last time they taught the class.<p>Not a Berkeley alum, but I went to UVa; which is considered a similar tier (if I remember right, the top 3 public schools in the US, at least by News+World rankings, are usually a toss up between Berkeley, UVa, and UCLA).<p>I think this is definitely true, and in basically every field a top school is strong in. The upper level courses, even at the undergraduate level (especially the ones people are not required to take. If it&#x27;s a required course, /someone/ has to teach it, and they might not be that into it, particularly if they aren&#x27;t teaching faculty. If it&#x27;s an elective, they&#x27;re teaching it because they think the subject is awesome.) are usually being taught by people who have made it their entire life&#x27;s work to study that field, and at that level of University are often some of the best people in that field. That kind of perspective, depth of knowledge, and passion don&#x27;t necessarily translate well to teaching (I can think of some math professors that I had...), but it often does, and even if it doesn&#x27;t those professors are usually /amazing/ resources outside of class if you want to know more about (subject of choice), what the current problems in that field are, what&#x27;s considered important or valuable, etc.<p>I&#x27;d hesitate to make sweeping generalizations, but I think that if you didn&#x27;t manage to take as many advanced courses (particularly graduate ones.  Good undergrads at institutions like that can almost always handle the graduate courses they offer after they have the sufficient background) with as many top people in a field (or fields) as possible, you wasted an opportunity if you were at a school like that.<p>(Full disclosure:  I come from a family of liberal arts professors at UVa, whose social circle largely consisted of other liberal arts professors at UVa.  I might be a little biased on the matter... but those people /know their field incredibly well/.  All of the ones I&#x27;ve met, both outside and in school, are both very, very smart and many of them spend the majority of their time thinking about one field or area of study.)",1400051101

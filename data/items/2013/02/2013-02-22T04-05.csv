5262791,comment,5262388,5262539,8,0,snprbob86,,,"> [T]he procedure is, for the normal person, a once-in-a-lifetime event. But the flunky on the other side of the desk does it every day.<p>I just had a TV delivered. And then a replacement delivered, but they were unauthorized to pick up the original, so the same two delivery guys had to come back a third time.<p>All three times, the delivery guys tried to force me to sign an incomplete form. They clearly wanted me to sign for whatever condition it was in and they would check all the boxes on my behalf to cover their own asses. The tactic was plainly obvious.<p>> The other solution is to be really, really nice. To be incredibly accommodating.<p>That's what I usually try to do in this sort of situation. However, it simply was <i>impossible</i> because the delivery guys 1) were rather large and intimidating 2) in my home, where I'm still unpacking and 3) spoke very poor english. Charm simply does not work on underpaid meatheads who don't understand the words your using. Any attempt to communicate clearly resulted in them becoming impatient and visibly annoyed, which resulted in me becoming uncomfortable (in my own home!). So each of the first two times, I just didn't sign my name. I just made an X that is in no way similar to my normal signature. The last time, for the pickup, I wrote ""PERFECT CONDITION"" over the whole form and then signed my name to that. The delivery guys were clearly <i>pissed</i> that last time because they didn't have another form and that if they dropped the TV, then they couldn't blame damage on me.",1361509146

5262779,comment,5261711,5262532,13,0,waterlesscloud,,,"When I was a teenager, there were a number of abandoned multistory office buildings in suburban Atlanta where I lived. Maybe 7-8 within 10 miles of my house, and a couple of cool abandoned restaurants too.  There had been a commercial real estate boom, followed by the inevitable bust.<p>Anyway, we got in to all of them at one time or another, sometimes via ridiculously elaborate plans.<p>What finally put an end to it for most of us was returning to one of our favorite buildings and finding someone had set up a wire tied to the inner doorknob that went off somewhere in to the dark hvac room.  Our imaginations about what might be at the other end of that wire convinced us that maybe we weren't as invincible as we thought.  You never know who else is going in those places.<p>There was also this weird abandoned castle out in the woods.   It was like a funhouse castle, wooden walls, but with fake stone on the outside.  Turrets, fake drawbridge, the whole thing. No clue whatsoever how it got there. Must have been some old amusement park?  But no one ever found any info on it.<p>Anyway, it involved parking on the side of this long stretch of country road, then walking a couple hundred yards through  some woods.  One night as we pulled over to park, this fat redneck dude comes out of the dark woods over to our car. Our windows are down and I'm in the passenger seat.<p>He points a MAC-10 right at my chest and tells us we need to be leaving.<p>For one time in my life I have literally nothing to say.<p>We drive off at a crazy rate of speed and never go back.<p>Being the south, there's a lot of things that could have been going on there that night, but the place was a few miles from where a crazy mercenary type had his commando training compound, so our theory was his people were using the place that night.<p>This guy, who also made suppressors for the MAC-10.

5262776,comment,5257559,5257559,2,0,wnsnw,,,"JQuery Mobile is horrible for mobile applications, IMO.<p>The intrinsic stylesheet, with its rounded corners, box shadows and text shadows results in extremely poor rendering performance in mobile browsers.  This can be rectified with work, but it demonstrates to me that their contributors are not at all concerned with performance.  Its markup is node heavy (a single LI turns in to 5 elements).  Considerations are made for desktop browsers, yet it is proselytized as a mobile framework.<p>Developing with it is cumbersome; the selectors you thought would work do not, because your element has been munged and wrapped with numerous other elements.  Triggering ""create"" more than once sometimes wraps elements a second time because some widgets don't check their classes properly to know they've already been marked up.  The only way to know the widget has been created is either checking for known classes or attempting to access one of its methods in a try/catch.<p>Some widgets respond to ""refresh"" - some don't.  Some parts of widgets respond to it, some don't.  This makes partial view updates almost, or completely, impossible.  I have been slowly replacing JQM's functionality with backbone views and it is working much, much better.<p>If you use jQuery Mobile in your mobile application, I advise you do so with an exit strategy in mind.",1361508711

Their software is quite easy to use. Papers can export your library to BibTeX, so I simply export it to the directory of the document I'm writing, include it as usual.<p>Now the best part, for referencing as I'm writing... Papers comes with this overlay when you press Control+M in OS X. This overlay consists of just a box to type in, you type the title of the paper or author names and it comes up with a search result, select the paper you want and press enter, you can then press enter again to add a LaTeX citation into your document or add more papers to cite multiple papers at once.

Happened to be a cop at that intersection who pulled me over.<p>Officer comes to the car, and asks about what I just did. I pretty much immediately admit to doing it, and tell him that it was a terrible lapse of judgement on my part. He takes me license/reg back and runs it, then comes back and just asks me how long I've been driving. I told him about 5 hours or so, and he says he meant how many years. I tell him 15 or so.<p>He comments that he can't find any tickets or things on my record, and I tell him I've never had one. He just tells me to not do it again and to move on. I apologized again and told him I appreciated him keeping an eye out for the public safety.<p>Now I <i>know</i> that you're supposed to be super defensive, and next to an asshole to the cop in citing all your rights and admitting to nothing.

Drupal is on the contrary a little more complicated to setup , but the basic set up is more powerfull than wordpress ( and the plugin system is better ).<p>That's why i dont think non php scripts can be popular to non programmers. you can just drop some python or some ruby on a webserver and expect it to work just like php does,<p>And few shared hosting providers support mod_python or stuff like that ( which is the shame because i see no reason why mod_python is worse than mod_php and we would have a whole generation of better programmers if people used python over php).",1361507944

By pushing the boundaries you create something with the potential to sustain as more than a throwaway gimmick.<p>I agree the fragility of content in the online world is.. worrying, if you take a long term perspective. I imagine the licensing of this content is the major risk here, as presumably BT are holding the copyright (even without the legal hurdle I doubt anyone could download the whole thing, without considerable effort).. all it would take to kill it is for BT to lose interest.<p>If you care about the legacy i would push for BT to allow the data to be shared (eventually), although i doubt this would work (mostly for bureaucratic reasons). If you have access to the work then i know what i would do; make 2 back ups to be stored in safe, separate places, to be released upon retirement, death, or BT losing interest (or ceasing to exist!). As raw as possible (they will have better image editing and stitching in photoshop 2110!).

It can be nerve-wrecking to imagine all your money evaporating.<p>Fortunately, your mistake cost you only $800. So it was actually a good learning experience. From now on, buy low and sell high. For example, the best time to buy is when a (recoverable) disaster or sensationalized story cause a financially strong company's stock price to dip. That's the perfect opportunity to buy some of that stock.",1361506222

5262584,comment,5261536,5262331,3,0,drucken,,,"The basis of this article is a May 2012 IMF Working Paper called <i>""Quantifying Structural Subsidy Values for Systematically Important Financial Institutions""</i> (<a href=""http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12128.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12128.pdf</a>).<p>The subsidy discussed is not an issue of economics directly, but capital markets, i.e. finance.<p>The paper infers a subsidy level for state-supported financial institutions by comparing the level of state support embedded in credit agency ratings and comparing them to their long-run average value. The authors control for the factors such as the sovereign's own ability to support, because sovereign debt is also rated by agencies, and for institutions intrinsic rating values.<p>Credit ratings are used directly and indirectly by capital market participants to determine the level of funding costs across all debt markets. So, they are the best available proxy for determining at least a floor for this preferential rate. As can be seen from previous financial crises, actual bailouts would be highly dependent on the nature of crises and may be substantially higher than expected.<p><i>How do those particular banks get that subsidy?</i><p>- from other market participants. In a sense, governments are permitting the misallocation of capital from other market participants, including governments and government agencies (hence taxpayers are directly involved), into the state-supported institutions. It is not a zero-sum game because of how that capital is then used.<p><i>Why not charge all banks the same rate and let the size of these banks eat themselves.</i><p>- there is no central rate allocation. Market participants use market prices and their best available information for funding costs. A state-supported institution is naturally considered by many participants to be a lower risk than a non-state supported institution.",1361505896

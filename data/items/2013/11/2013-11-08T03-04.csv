IHG (disclaimer: shareholder and double super platinum for life due to often staying there for business travel) has been trying to move, for years, into a capital structure which Airbnb had from day one: they want a cut of every night&#x27;s stay without actually owning any hotel property because that&#x27;s a capital-intensive location-dependent slow-growth business.  They&#x27;ve got a substantial scale advantage on Airbnb (~600,000 rooms which each rent 300+ nights per year, whereas Airbnb does about 50 million nights a year at systematically lower price points), but 5~10% a year is great growth for them, and Airbnb is growing at about 100% every 6 months.<p>There exist significant risks to the company, from the legal issues to merely not sustaining the hockey stick for long enough to justify the valuation, but the people with money on the line are mostly rich and sophisticated.

Read Crossing the Chasm to understand why that is.  At the time that the private market investors care about them, they are so early in the selling motions that their early success in a tiny subset of the market is indicative of later potential.

To see something with early potential, pay a premium (at times) to get a part of it, foster it&#x27;s development, and then ride it into reality and receive a terrific return for the foresight and fortitude.<p>The pattern recognition there is unmistakeable.  Where it gets challenged is in the fickle and finicky consumer market where externalities are more likely to cause massive changes in momentum (See: Path can&#x27;t maintain the momentum of fundraising).<p>&quot;A surge on IPO day is good of course, but 15-20% is more than enough; 75% simply means the company was mis-priced and that Twitter left over a billion in cash on the table.&quot;<p>This is also not a factually true statement.  Because a small float was offered, and demand was prescriptive by the bankers, it&#x27;s impossible to say that because of how it ended, trying to raise the price to $40 would have resulted in the same outcome.<p>If Twitter wanted to fully maximize their first day gains, there are dutch style IPO auctions that can be done to better match demand for an offering.

6694242,comment,6693046,6693046,8,0,devin,,,"I ran Slackware many moons ago. It was very bare bones and it took a lot of work, but I was young and it was an immersive experience. As another commenter wrote, people on IRC played up how 1337 they were for running Slack. I disagree slightly with that statement. I spent a lot of time building my Slack system on a PII 266, and I was 12, so it took me a long time with a lot of false starts. I don&#x27;t think anyone was trying to be &quot;1337&quot;, they were just proud of what they&#x27;d accomplished. I know I was.<p>In any event, it&#x27;s cool to see Slack is still around. I installed ArchLinux on my MBP a couple weeks back. After installing Mavericks, the modified EFI partition I created no longer lets me boot Arch, so I think I&#x27;ll give Slack a try. It&#x27;s the challenge that makes it worth it.<p>Also, I have to strongly suggest to anyone who is not all that into Linux but is interested in learning: Skip the window environment. Force yourself to just sit there on the command line. It&#x27;s surprising the kind of focus you have when you can&#x27;t be distracted by all manner of visual eye candy. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it was a real pleasure to use only the CLI. It&#x27;s sort of like the difference between writing with sidewalk chalk and a fine fountain pen. You find yourself writing /differently/. It&#x27;s a subtle change with lots of unintended consequences that cause you to think about your work from a different perspective.

6694240,comment,6693066,6694185,4,0,ryan-allen,,,"Ah, I suppose what I mean by capitalism is a more pathological optimisation of employees with authority. If you think of a company as something that is optimising for profitability through not only producing something, but by doing everything in their power to stifle competition, by preventing competitors from succeeding by any legal means, then you can look at an employee and their behaviour in a similar matter.<p>People often have houses to pay off, kids to feed, cars to buy, and they&#x27;re interested in maintaining their foothold. They might say they buy in to a companies culture but the reality is, if they had to sacrifice themselves for said culture they&#x27;d always put their interests first.<p>So employees with limited power and authority over their little domain, are going to act in their own interests by as you say hiring people like themselves, by creating a culture that matches their values and keeps outsiders at bay, and by ousting anything that threatens the status quo.<p>It would be really interesting to see how things would work if people were able to separate costs of living and productive activity, but because they&#x27;re tied up they&#x27;re going to influence each other.<p>Why would someone over-quote on a job? Because they want more money so they can buy that thing they want or pay down their house quicker. Why would someone fire someone for not being a &#x27;cultural fit&#x27;, maybe it&#x27;s because their behaviour threatens their position in some way. No questions are good questions. If Blackberry could have flipped a switch and prevented the iPhone from ever being made, by god they would have done it. It&#x27;s the same behaviour and it&#x27;s prevalent as hell.<p>So, that&#x27;s what I mean.<p>EDIT: It ultimately does come down to money and protecting income streams (i.e. employment) while expending the least amount of energy as required. It&#x27;s hard work for a manager to look after the needs of a team that has a cultural outlier even if they are ultimately improving business outcomes. It&#x27;s easier to have people to nod their heads in agreement and show up 9 to 5, produce maybe 10 hours of true productive work a week.

I vaguely recall the core being that Mark Crispin&#x27;s[1] RFCs were internally inconsistent, such that it was <i>impossible</i> to implement a standards-compliant IMAP server.<p>Of course, UW-IMAP preceded the RFCs, so there was already a &quot;reference implementation&quot; against which other implementations could be compared and found wanting.  Mark was especially obnoxious about protecting his view of IMAP.<p>This was a weird time at the UofW.  We had a hypertext system (UWIN) that was a mess and HTTP was banned as a server technology.  Run a webserver for any reason, and disusering was a very real threat.  They may have allowed gopher, but it&#x27;s been a while.<p>PINE, of course, came out of this, which wasn&#x27;t too bad, as it inspired a number of decent successors.<p>Best of all, Ada was the pedagogical programming language for the computer science program.

The final text would most certainly be public; you&#x27;re probably referring to an agreement to keep negotiating documents secret for a 4 year period as described here (by an organization opposed to that approach): <a href=""http://www.citizen.org/documents/us-transparency-letter-2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citizen.org/documents/us-transparency-letter-2011...</a><p>I&#x27;m actually in favor of this approach. WTO negotiations involves full transparency, as mentioned in the letter above; it&#x27;s also true that the WTO has been unable to reach agreement on what&#x27;s known as the &#x27;Doha round&#x27; for almost 13 years now. There are multiple reasons why that might or might not have happened, but the upshot is that trade liberalization has been stalled for over a decade. If negotiations out of the spotlight increase the parties&#x27; willingness to conclude a more limited and offer <i>that</i> for ratification, I&#x27;m willing to put up with it.

It had many things right and finding defects in retrospect is always an easy task.<p>In retrospect, NPM was a bit rude to it&#x27;s userbase. We&#x27;ve asked for support on custom, multiple, and private registries. PRs have even been made for them and Isaac explicitly shut them down only to later (much later) come out and talk about NPM Inc. NPM is a great tool, and the community for building upon it is absolutely fantastic and wonderful, but the leadership and advisory board behind it are pretty terrible for something as good as NPM.<p>May be I am a bit harsh, and I may be a bit biased coming from &quot;the old crowd&quot; in Node before it was the cool thing on the block (funny to think back on Rubyist snickering at me for mentioning node to them :))<p>At least NPM has git URLs which is nice, and may be NPM can do these things (I&#x27;ve abandoned it for much saner practices other than cloning a 50+gb registry, pointing to  a registry that falls back to an official registry [big security no-no, at least allow checksums], etc).<p>Thank you for the perspective though, less whining and more typing (contributing to NPM). My anger is more so towards the leadership of NPM rather than the toolset itself and I didn&#x27;t express that in my OC ^",1417921073

Targeted searches are not relevant, and assuming they have a proper warrant, is perfectly legal. I&#x27;m sure some unavoidable collection happens while executing targeted searches, and the filtering necessary is is just the mechanics of wiretapping. Obviously, this is not the illegal part.<p>Bulk, non-targeted collection is very different. The NSA admits they do not meet the 4th Amendment&#x27;s warrant requirement, while claiming to have a general warrant from the FISA court, often while waving around Sections 215 and 702 of the Patriot Act, or Executive Order 12333. IN the end, the NSA is still claiming to have a general warrant (&quot;writ of assistance&quot;). As we have not had a constitutional amendment that repeals the 4th Amendment, the specific warrant requirement is still the highest law of the land.<p>Running your &quot;grep&quot; filter to find the communications of a specific target will probably run across other people&#x27;s communications. The important part is that - as a <i>targeted</i> action - it only applies to specific locations (or routers/etc) at some some specific time. If you getting a traditional search warrant to search someone&#x27;s house does <i>not</i> allow you to come back at some future data for another search, nor does it extend to other locations.<p>On the other hand, if you had a warrant to search Alice&#x27;s apartment, it is likely that some of her roommate Carol&#x27;s stuff will be search as well. This is unfortunate, but probably unavoidable and generally legal. The fact that there is a valid reason for the search of Carol&#x27;s stuff doesn&#x27;t suddenly extend to allowing a search of anybody else.",1417921043

RMS seems to prefer:<p><pre><code>   FLOSS code, your server > Unknown code, someone else&#x27;s server > Non-free code, your server
</code></pre>
But unknown code on someone else&#x27;s server can generally do far more in terms of anti-features than non-free code on your server. You can at least see how much data is being exfiltrated; they still have to worry about people reverse engineering the code and ruining their reputation if they do something too bad; you at least have the option to reverse engineer the data format or network protocol and replace their code with something you completely understand and control. If the data is on their server, you give up a tremendous amount of control.<p>I think some of the stuff RMS writes can serve as a cautionary tale about not letting rational heuristics that start with good intentions become dogma (as can the development of many religions which also probably started with good intentions) - hyperbolic thinking and using words like evil and wrong to describe something you think should be avoided always seems to lead to things getting taken too far.",1417919737

8711034,comment,8710684,8710684,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I was struck by what the article reported about recent trends in democratization after years of economic progress in most of the many countries in Africa. &quot;For now, the advance of democracy in Africa appears to have stalled. In 1990, just three of Africa’s 48 countries were electoral democracies, according to Freedom House, a Washington-based pro-democracy advocacy group. By 1994, that number had leapt to 18. Two decades later, only 19 qualify.&quot; What I like about the article is that it distinguishes the situations in differing countries on a continent of considerable diversity. Going to a recent Freedom House blog post[1] showed a map of which countries that organization identifies as &quot;free&quot; (green on the map), &quot;partly free&quot; (yellow), and &quot;not free&quot; (purple) by that organization&#x27;s rating scale. Fortunately, some of the most populous countries in Africa are free (e.g., South Africa) or partly free (e.g., Nigeria and Kenya). The commentary in the post about ten different countries was also informative about key issues.<p>Yes, the main issue is freedom. The countries that additionally have democracy usually bring along with effective democracy such individual liberty features as an independent judiciary, a free press, and freedom of speech for the populace. That&#x27;s important for people&#x27;s daily lives. I lived in Taiwan both before and after that country&#x27;s democratization, and life became much better with democracy. I&#x27;d like to see the same happen in many more countries around the world.<p>[1] <a href=""https://freedomhouse.org/blog/10-positive-developments-africa-2013#.VIO6bDHF-So"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freedomhouse.org/blog/10-positive-developments-afric...</a><p><a href=""https://freedomhouse.org/regions/sub-saharan-africa#.VIO9pDHF-So"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freedomhouse.org/regions/sub-saharan-africa#.VIO9pDH...</a>",1417919699

8711029,comment,8709530,8709530,0,0,benzesandbetter,,,"Of course, you should always be learning new technologies and tools.  But that part&#x27;s obvious, so I&#x27;m not going to give it attention here.<p>I have two pieces of advice for you.  
The first is: Develop your sales and storytelling ability.  
The second is: Follow the money.<p>One of the challenges of selling yourself as a SysAdmin, is that when you do your job properly, things just work.  This makes you almost invisible...  Generally, people only &quot;notice&quot; SysAdmins, when something is broken: builds fail, a website slows down, a web service times out, mail starts bouncing, etc.  To improve your trajectory, you need to relentlessly train your ability to show the key people in your organization your successes.  (As a side benefit, having this information organized is also highly useful to you if you decide to shop for a new gig.)  Think constantly about how to tell the stories of your work, aided by stats and ideally, quotes from colleagues.  I recommend reading the Phoenix Project for a bit of insight about this.  There&#x27;s a character in that story (Brent) who is the go-to devOps pro, but most people in the organization don&#x27;t realize how critical he is.  This is a classical failure in self-marketing.  The company would literally fall apart if he wasn&#x27;t there, and yet he&#x27;s working longer hours than anyone else and probably getting paid about the same as his much less competent colleagues.<p>You also need to follow the money.  In every business, there are certain things that terrify senior management.  Perhaps it&#x27;s failing a SOX or audit or losing PCI compliance.  Maybe it&#x27;s a breach of customer or patient data.  Perhaps it&#x27;s having a key piece of infrastructure go offline.  Move yourself as close as you can to those business-critical elements.  One of my projects is maintaining a scheduling application for some very expensive medical imaging equipment for a federal agency.  These machines price out in the millions of dollars, and are shared by more than 30 research groups.  Having even one of them go offline represents a huge cost to the organization.  When I interviewed with them, there was basically zero push-back about price or hourly rate.  All they cared about was how reliably I could keep these machines online.  If I pitch them on some ideas which will improve reliability or disaster response, they are, of course, very receptive.  That is the kind of infrastructure you want to be close to.  Figure out what keeps your CxO&#x27;s up at night, and find ways to make those problems go away.<p>Depending on your organization, these two things will improve your trajectory to a point.  You may start to reach a ceiling in terms of income, as they may have a mental block with paying a sysadmin above, say, $150k/yr.  If you want to reach higher, you may need to make the jump to working for your self.  At that point, you probably want to find a better term for what you do than &quot;SysAdmin&quot;.  Labels such as &quot;Scalability Specialst&quot;, &quot;BI Consultant&quot;, or &quot;Critical Infrastructure First Responder&quot; might help you with positioning in such a way to command more respect and income for your efforts.",1417919590

Not a meditational leader, not a friend, not a spouse, and not an article...not even this comment. It will never be up to anyone other than yourself and the development of the ability to take a thought or a physical distraction at the moment it presents itself and eliminating it entirely. Truly saying NO! NO! NO! Repeatedly in your mind louder than the thought fighting for your attention. You&#x27;ve seen that move &quot;Yes! Man&quot; starring Jim Carrey most likely I would say. In the movie a man encounters a program developed to expand his mind and opportunities by simply saying &quot;Yes&quot; to them. How convenient it turned out for him. He went on a romantic adventure filled with spoiling homeless men with material possessions, late night dance clubs under the ambience of exotically non-rhyming music,  experienced the spectacle activity called &quot;Running Photography&quot;, and fell in love. Take a cue from that movie if you feel much too spread out and instead of allowing your mind to say &quot;Yes! Man&quot; to each new thought and ambition that presents itself force your mind to say &quot;No! Man&quot; without any other option.<p>Be a man, be a NO man. Be grounded in your actions and thoughts and train that habit and nature. It takes a while but it can and will happen because physiologically as a human you are designed to adapt.  You can undo all those years of allowing your mind to say yes to everything the internet and the world had to offer. Realistically it may take just as long in a worst case scenario to un-train those habits and force them out with the mindset you really want. But in the training process you will actually be having an immediate effect from the very first time you say NO in your mind and eliminate an adversary. So that by the time you feel you have sharp and well-honed mindset you set out to achieve you in-directly demolished every other little thing on your life list as a result.<p>That&#x27;s all I can offer.

This matter is just a personally experienced one and I possess strong opinions regarding it.<p>You do not have to read it, and I cannot make you do so, but I highly suggest that you do. The information I provide may not be for everyone. I understand this. It may not be for you. That&#x27;s okay. But as for my own and personal journey it has proven itself time to time to the point that I now longer look for a solution as it has proven it&#x27;s effectiveness time and time again.<p>The biggest suggestion I can offer you is to consider what my father taught me at a very young age and continues to do so even now in my mid-twenties.<p>Be a man.<p>It&#x27;s as simple as that. What does &quot;Being a man&quot; entail you ask? It means being TOUGH. It means to see a problem and instead of ignoring or denying you accept that you DO have a problem on hand.<p>That&#x27;s the first step. The first step is to always take the first step in solving that problem. Let&#x27;s look at an example, any volunteers? Oh wait, why not you? You browse all these comments that provide you with multiple methods that can &quot;solve&quot; or remedy your problem throughout the day and night, you go to Google to search up on a few of them that stand out. Dissatisfied you come back and browse more ways, then it’s back to Google....then before you know it you&#x27;ve went 20 links in to 20 different websites over the course of a few days. It is then you have a new problem. You get overwhelmed with the different ways to go about it and all the little details involved with each one. Now we have gone from the pot to the kettle.
There is a reason for this. It is because the core problem is not what we expose ourselves to, it is what we allow our minds to waste it&#x27;s time processing whether directly exposed or as the result of a thought itself. You said you felt like you had a layer in your mind that knows what you need to do, and a separate layer that is absorbing everything around you and filing it away regardless of what you are doing. Therefore the most effective result of any method you try for fixing your issue should have the ultimate result of COMPILING both of those layers into ONE which allows you to truly absorb everything about whatever it is you are doing at that very moment. 
What I have to do personally will sound a bit odd. I have had to become cold in nature. Allowing my mind to only process the things that I have decided need to be done for the day. I accept no other information. I mentally, and sometimes verbally, say NO to any outside influence that would deter me from what I set out to accomplish. Over time your mind will be honed to the point where you truly do feel a sense of control over the direction of your life. 
(Disclaimer: I do however allow myself exceptions for the things that directly and sometimes indirectly affect any of the core components in life: Health, Family, Spirituality, and Financials. If a decision I say no to can either really affect one of those in a negative way, or if saying no to taking an unexpected opportunity could truly benefit one of those core components immediately or in the long run I take make that decision on the spot based upon that criteria and importance.)<p>Let&#x27;s look at an example situation for how important it is to have a well-developed mental toughness and the ability to say NO.<p>You wake up, its 8am and you decide it’s time for you to have your breakfast. You read an article and digest it for a few minutes or even debate it for a few minutes with a companion. We&#x27;re  doing good so far it&#x27;s been 15 minutes no upsets we are well on our way to getting what needs done today.<p>Now our mind reflects upon our agenda for the day which we liberally emptied onto paper last night. We look down this list of things we have to do and while we are sitting there suddenly a  single word, let&#x27;s say &quot;word document&quot; if we have to type a paper that day, on the list stands out to us in our mind and triggers a wonderment over something related to that. We think to ourselves &quot;I wonder if Open Office software has greater advantages over Microsoft word?&quot;. After pondering about that relation we decide to research it a little. We fire up the laptop to do a little quick research to just satisfy curiosity. Well what do you know, Open Office really has established a rival status in the word processing enterprise. We should give that a spin. So you start the download, run through the install impatiently as you know you need to leave soon to attend to your list of things to do. That&#x27;s okay Open Office is going to simplify some of the things I do so it&#x27;s going to save me time in the long run.<p>After installing the software we fire it up to check it out. Oh pretty neat! We browse the tools, definitely got some handy tools for what I need done. We decide to create a document just for fun and testing. File -> New Document -> Clickety Clack Clickety Clack we&#x27;ve got a short little paragraph about how awesome Open Document is in a matter of minutes. Aha! That’s very nice...hey wait! Let’s make an agenda to prettify what I&#x27;ve wrote on paper. Everybody knows a professional looking agenda makes you want to accomplish these things more just as a large sparkling trophy will oust a smiley sticker any day of the week.
We realize we need to save some time, so we decide to outsource the document template to one prebuilt and just fill it on in. So back to the file menu it is, then we realize the selection of good agenda templates is much too limited. Ah, I know we will just Google up one real quick. So that we do. About 5 sites and 72 clicks later we have a template to suit our taste. We begin our transfer of the crumply paper agenda to a beautiful little digital one that will soon be on crisp white paper. We spell check in case anyone peaks, punctuate in case anyone cares, and tweak the fonts a bit for readability. We look at the time, it’s after 11am. We justify that with the fact that having this new and beautiful agenda will help us get things done. We print and admire our fine creation. While we sit that at the table admiring our warm from the printer agenda...a specific word on that paper stands out to us in our mind...and we ponder something related to it...<p>And down again the rabbit hole do we go, as we lack the self-control and fine-tuned ability of saying NO. We lack being tough enough to say, &quot;You know what maybe open office can help we will have to find out tonight when we have what we set out to do done.&quot; Or even cutting the though off at the knees as soon as it appears in our mind and strongly saying &quot;I cannot think about that right now.&quot; Letting that thought dissolve through sheer intent. Not accepting or allowing its presence any longer, getting up from that table and walking out that door at 8:30am instead of looking up at 11:30am and realizing that even though we have accomplished something new, and even somewhat related to the things we do on the daily basis we have never advanced any closer to having what needs to be done than when we started 3 hours ago.<p>Further down the road after this process repeats itself over and over through the years, and we go to clock in at our subpar job of help desk support we pause...and our mind for an instant reflects upon our situation of being nowhere near where we expected to be at such an older age. We process this thought further and remember all of the little moments we had a choice between an option that would have taken us farther then we are now and one that took us in circles but seemed a lot more interesting at that single moment in time, and we are faced with the reality that we chose the interesting circle more than we should have. A lot more.<p>(..Continued)",1417918181

The &quot;collapse&quot; of the USSR didn&#x27;t look so much like an adjustment (i.e. what you would expect if those numbers were completely fictitious) but rather a leveling off of growth. As for your &quot;obvious example,&quot; 1. importing food is not necessarily indicative of a shortfall and 2. from what I understand, the central government of the USSR occasionally starved sizable chunks of its population for political reasons rather than due to actual shortfalls (e.g. while simultaneously exporting food).",1417918179

You can also explicitly mention in the README that the project is looking for a new maintainer, which to me always seems a bit friendlier than just stating you&#x27;ve abandoned the project.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t officially pick a new maintainer for your project, if a couple of forks spring up on github consider linking to them from your README if they still seem active after a couple of months.",1417918088

As far as we know, all existing free software would qualify as open source. Nearly all open source software is free software, but there are exceptions. First, some open source licenses are too restrictive, so they do not qualify as free licenses. Fortunately, few programs use those licenses.<p>Second, and more important, many products containing computers (including many Android devices) come with executable programs that correspond to free software source code, but the devices do not allow the user to install modified versions of those executables; only one special company has the power to modify them. We call these devices “tyrants”, and the practice is called “tivoization” after the product where we first saw it. These executables are not free software even though their source code is free software. The criteria for open source do not recognize this issue; they are concerned solely with the licensing of the source code.<p><a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point....</a><p><a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.htm...</a>",1417918027

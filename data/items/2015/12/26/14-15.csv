My question is what to use to control the lights.  I&#x27;m sure that some of you have holiday displays running.  Can you post what controller(s) you are using?  How are you synchronizing lights across the display?  Are you using multiple controllers (why yes, I do have a Beowulf Cluster of light controllers).<p>I figure if I start now I&#x27;ll have a chance in being done for next year.  Thanks for your help!",1451141969

Not sure how they will go from electron-positron creation to protons which needs quarks, but according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_creation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_creation</a><p>Summary: Matter creation is the conversion of massless particles into one or more massive particles. Since all known massless particles are bosons and the most familiar massive particles are fermions, usually what is considered is the process which converts two bosons (e.g. photons) into two fermions (e.g., an electron–positron pair). This process is known as pair production.<p>So technically, it is a matter creation.",1451141859

The problem is that we&#x27;re telling these people that failure is not an option, that if you fail now it ruins you. The more we say it, the more true it is, as students race for the A+. It is, after all, an arms race. However, we miss an important lesson, that failure is inevitable and even important. Some venture capitalists will not fund someone who hasn&#x27;t failed 3 times before, because they know that failure is a function of both effort and environment, and a failure followed by more effort shows that when the environment lines up the entrepreneur in question will still be putting in effort.",1451141176

Unsurprisingly nothing on market seems to. Jeez - stick to plain text) </i>\nI&#x27;m really surprised that those dedicated anti-spam components like Barracuda, or those enterprise apps like ESET which hook into Exchange, don&#x27;t perform this sort of  analysis already. The volume of incoming mail even for a large organization would be pretty easy to analyze every single byte of every single message coming in and check it for certain things.<p>Barracuda rack-servers&#x27; sole purpose is to block spam and viruses, do they really not do deep-inspection? I mean every Win32 binary, even if packed, compressed, dynamically self-modifying, whatever, still needs an entry point. Those bytes still need to be embedded into your plain text somewhere, even if it isn&#x27;t via the SMTP attachment standard. The attack vector surely must have some commonality (haven&#x27;t read any post mortems but if it&#x27;s an OLE exploit, &quot;contentType=&quot;application/vnd.ms-word&quot; is going to be there in straight up ASCII).<p>Either way, one might not know what&#x27;s in a binary, but you can definitively determine when something is a binary, at which point, anything which isn&#x27;t white-listed doesn&#x27;t get in. Is this just a matter of network admin&#x27;s not being able to be aggressive enough with their filtering policies and/or GPO? The next line of defense would be to only let white-listed signed apps run which is fairly trivial with Win 10[1]. Disable the ability to install extensions in your white-listed browser (Firefox Youtube Downloader Plus!! Awesome!! is likely to have adware that&#x27;s bundled in), disable Flash, and one would have a pretty sanitary network right?<p>Edit: Yeah, I should have finished reading the article. He mentioned application whitelisting too as a defense. Critical environments with good security will not be effected by this. Also, the author mentioned &quot;most&quot; anti-viruses won&#x27;t detect this-- I don&#x27;t have a Barracuda box to test against, but I&#x27;ll bet $10 it catches this. So yeah, there are (quite a few) defenses within a properly locked down environment.<p>Clever find though.<p>[1] <a href=""https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd723683(v=ws.10).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd723683(v=ws.10...</a>",1451140369

That argument is almost always used against people who complain about spoilers, and sadly it&#x27;s often insultingly non-understanding. I&#x27;m not saying that all discussion are spoilers. While my personal wish is to not know anything about a movie before seeing it (which I have never regretted afterwards, by the way – the opposite, having advance knowledge, has not hurt the experience always, but it has never ever improved it), I realize that this is hard to achieve and requires <i>me</i> to take care of that, not everyone else. As you mention, that would impose too much of a burden on everyone else.<p>But that does not mean there is not still a lot of stuff that really should be considered spoilers, and the complaints about these should not be brushed off just because you think I expect you to not mention anything about a movie. I think it&#x27;s a very valid criticism when the article in question reveals something that even the trailers kept unknown by never showing that person, without any need for it in the context of the article. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;The Sixth Sense, where he was dead all along, was quite good, I loved the cinematography.&quot; a week after that movie was released. While I personally would not have wanted to know about the cinematographical quality either, I realize I can&#x27;t complain about hearing something like that when reading a review or when I&#x27;m not fleeing a discussion of the movie quickly enough. I never would complain about that. But I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who would be pretty annoyed to read said plot detail in an article about e.g. &quot;The decline of quality in M. Night Shyamalan movies&quot; a week after that movies release.<p>To sum it up: I agree with your basic point, but I think too often people that are fine with spoilers don&#x27;t care about the fact that other people have a different level of acceptance and when confronted with that simply resort to saying &quot;Well, it&#x27;s silly to have this level of acceptance.&quot;",1451139966

Especially considering how the frontiers of science are so difficult to keep track of. Like, if you were to base your diet on recent nutrition research, you&#x27;d have to spend hours every day just reviewing the literature, and you&#x27;d probably have to change your diet every week to accomodate for new findings, contradictions, etc.<p>To me it seems like people are most likely to just go by their own intuitive desires and preferences, using science at most to validate and confirm what they already wanted based on other factors. So, bluntly speaking, someone who is really fascinated by &quot;spiritual&quot; stuff will google for &quot;meditation benefits pdf&quot; and someone who wants to do other things with their time will look out for criticisms and &quot;FUD.&quot;<p>Mostly I&#x27;d just make the point that if you try and sit quietly for ten minutes on three consecutive days, that&#x27;s a negliglible time spent to try for yourself something that a lot of people say is significantly nice in some way—and that&#x27;s probably a more efficient use of time than to try and look through the available scientific evidence.",1451139654

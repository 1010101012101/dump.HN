83287,comment,83161,83240,0,0,tx,,,"I lost you at the beginning of the 2nd paragraph. Nobody who  knows how to muscle their ways in C++ feels good after transitioning to Java. There is nothing ""liberating"" in this hog for someone who <i>knows</i> C++. There is nothing in Java that one can call ""beautiful"" or ""enjoyable"". I am sorry to sound like an idiot (yes, I have re-read what I just wrote) but I cannot help it - Java is full of hidden messages like ""oh, we feel like you're too stupid to have this or that kind of power, so just sit in a sandbox and enjoy the ride"". And indeed, most programming idiots I've met in my career called themselves ""Java programmers"".<p>No statically typed language without powerful template system nor multiple inheritance of some sort should be considered usable in this age and time. Java/C# (same shit) was designed for ""enterprise software"" development, something a CS grad should never, never, never consider doing. <p>Ruby is the opposite of all that - Ruby represents ultimate freedom of expression. C++ runs circles around Java in that regard. Ruby only takes it several levels higher. In Ruby you really <i>do</i> feel like changing the world, as long as your world is written in Ruby as well. It's sad you missed it as the main point of the great post.<p>P.S. Go get yourself some decent C++ book. <p>\n",1195968582

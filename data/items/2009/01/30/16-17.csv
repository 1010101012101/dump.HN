As with any indicator there is quite a bit of uncertainty. And as you suggest ""there are the hires that happen without a listing...""  Most career counselors would agree that there are actually more hidden jobs than what the boards suggest...<p>So... your argument might just boost the number if we add some multiplier into the model based on the jobs actually posted.<p>thanks!\ngne1963",1233334684

458286,comment,457100,457292,0,0,davidsrose,,,"Alain, as much as I appreciate your kind words [grin], I disagree with your premise. If the alternative is to NOT open the platform to entrepreneurs, how does that help anyone? Even in a world of Web 2.0 and fast-track development, creating, maintaining and operating a site like Angelsoft is very non-trivial. Since the company is not a charity, there needs to be a business model somewhere through which we provide enough value (both real and perceived) that someone(s) is willing to pay for it.<p>After spending five years of time, effort and a 20 person team developing a single platform that now powers a large majority of the world's organized angel investing, we've finally got something which entrepreneurs [correctly, in my view] believe is worth paying $250 for: powerful tools for managing their fundraising process, combined with access to over 15,000 legitimate investors who use the other side of the platform as their own deal processing tool.<p>In contrast, there are probably two dozen sites on the web which purport to be 'matching services' for entrepreneurs and investors, but the unfortunate dark secret is that while those sites often charge much, much more (in some cases, thousands of dollars), they have NO investors at all. With Angelsoft, we have created (for the first time anywhere) and provide (completely for free) a single, searchable directory of just about every angel group around. Together with a free ""common app"" for funding (as you noted), and the ability to apply to multiple groups at no charge through the site with a single click, I think it is fair to say that Angelsoft has done more to help entrepreneurs navigate the often-confusing world of angel investing than anyone else, ever. That's why we're the official software platform of the non-profit national and international associations of angels and angel groups in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, the Middle East and elsewhere.<p>I think the best way to look at Angelsoft is in the context of something like LinkedIn, for both investors and entrepreneurs. As with LinkedIn, basic use of the system is free to all, which enabled them (and enables us) to establish a meaningful universe of participants who gain real value from the basic services. With the platform then in place, they (and we) can now layer on additional, value-added services which may (or may not) be worth the cost to any given participant.<p>Do you think less of LinkedIn because they charge for job postings? How about receiving InMail, for which privilege the sender pays? If you don't want to receive InMail, you simply uncheck a box. If the sender doesn't feel that the ability to send messages is worth $25-$400/month, he or she doesn't pay it. But without the existence of the underlying site, value-added features like InMail and job postings wouldn't be possible in the first place.<p>With Angelsoft, we are always trying to navigate carefully among the needs of our three constituencies: angel investors, entrepreneurs...and ourselves as a for-profit company. Investors would love it if they only got one deal a month, and it was a guaranteed 30x return that was available only to them, for free. Entrepreneurs would love it if they could have free and unfettered access to the personal emails of 15,000 check-writing investors. I would love it if both of the forgoing paid Angelsoft hundreds of millions of dollars annually :-).  Unfortunately, all of the above desires are mutually exclusive.<p>We think that we've done a pretty good job at creating a compromise platform that supports all three constituencies (well, at least the first two; we're not quite breakeven at Angelsoft yet :-), but we welcome any constructive comments or suggestions as to how we can improve our value proposition to everyone.<p>-David S.

Yes, things get cheaper rapidly after initial R&D, but this slows down dramatically after a few years. Once the initial R&D cost is recouped you will find that there is still a significant production cost that is slow to reduce and doesn't really move much at all.<p>I recently bought a 200MHz ARM7 board with 128MB of RAM.

458249,comment,457100,457160,0,0,davidsrose,,,"Paul, with all due respect, I have to disagree. As both the Chairman of New York Angels, and the CEO of Angelsoft (which grew out of our perceived need for a comprehensive deal management platform), I think it's both inaccurate and unfair to state that angel groups are ""generally worthless"" and ""the best angels are not members"".<p>Taking our own group as an example, we have directly funded over $35 million into 54 companies during the past five years, have had successful exits in sales to companies like CBS and Kodak, and have a membership that includes 75 active, participating angels such as Esther Dyson, Scott Kurnit, Chris Anderson, Roger Ehrenberg, Brian Cohen, Charlie Federman, Lewis Gersh, David Hirsch and many others, all of whom commit to investing at least $100,000 annually. This year we funded about $4 million into 22 companies. How far off are those stats from yours at yC? For my own part, I have personally invested in over 70 startups and serve on half a dozen early stage boards.  If that means I'm a ""lame investor"", I'm a little confused.<p>Angelsoft was founded to bring to the world of angel investing the type of infrastructure, tools and communications that venture funds and commercial organizations like yCombinator already have. Since angels are, by definition, part-time investors for whom this is not a primary occupation, it has always been a pretty chaotic and haphazard way to put to work the $25 billion annually that angels in the US invest (which is just about the same amount as all VCs put together.)  Now that something like 90% of the angel groups in the world, with 15,000+ accredited investors in 43 countries, have all standardized on a single platform, we're finally beginning to bring some order to the chaos.<p>The Investor Community on Angelsoft was designed, as Ryan Janssen pointed out, to enable groups to syndicate deals with each other. At New York Angels, we have worked together with groups from Boston, California, Washington, Florida, Texas, Nevada, Missouri and Connecticut to fund cool startups...something that would have been logistically impractical prior to the advent of a single, standardized platform.<p>Now that we've opened it up to direct submissions by entrepreneurs, we seem to be on our way to solving the biggest challenge of angel investing: ""I want to increase my deal flow, but I don't want to be spammed by having to respond to every company asking for funding"". Instead of having entrepreneurs apply directly to one group for which they may well not be appropriate, the Investor Community allows angels to browse a much wider array of deals, and then affirmatively bring to their group only deals in which they have an interest. As Ryan noted in an early response here, companies that posted to the Investor Community and then were referred into groups by the angels themselves were over 200% more likely to get funded.<p>Paul, we both know how tough the funding environment is for startups, and we both know that your small investments and support into 102 companies, and our larger investments and support into 54 companies, are only drops in the bucket when one considers that there are over 600,000 companies started each year in the US. But angels and angel groups really ARE a legitimate part of the ecosystem, and I don't think you're doing a service to your readers by disputing that.<p>yCombinator was a brilliant idea with which you are doing a superb job of execution, and your results speak for themselves. You don't need to promote yC by slinging mud at others who are equally active and supportive of entrepreneurs.",1233331755

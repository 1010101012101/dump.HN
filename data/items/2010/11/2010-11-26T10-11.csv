I agree with posters who claim that the books will be published eventually at market price; our problem is that the market is very slow to stabilise and we must suffer from inefficiencies in the market while it stabilises.

Sure if all you're doing is hosting a webapp on a server you control (which seems to be the main use case for Ruby), then it's not a problem.  Once you start trying to deploy on platforms you don't control a complete standard lib becomes really handy.<p>That is one reason I really like python.  I can say something like ""install any version of python 2 after 2.6.2"" and that's all they need to worry about.  There is very little you cannot do using only the standard lib.  No hunting for and installing third party libs with all the troubles that can cause.<p>Obviously I'm not arguing against third party libraries.  I use and love many in python.

Not really from consumer web - Or any consumer oriented service that an entrepreneur can gain value, by utilizing multi-processor systems.<p>It's the organizations with big bucks that call the shots, or drive innovation. 
Like NCEP/NOAA in weather prediction. Not the guy who moves to the Bay area who wants to hack something, get traction in user base, get funding,and finally mint money :-)<p>The demand for writing consumer facing software for multi-processor systems is simply too less now.",1290765879

1942044,comment,1941046,1941377,0,0,kiriappeee,,,"fair enough. I'm about to start proper proper development for the market (all this time it's been apps I made for myself when I needed something done) and yes the first thought that came to my mind was if I implement the paid component for this how do I go about actually marketing it (I'm not yet in a paid app enabled zone). Hmmm. I didn't think about that being a direct effect. Thanks. I shall research on this since I do recall an article from sometime back about the market mentality of Android. Will start there.<p>cheers",1290765755

You can convey a lot of very basic yet important concepts, and immediatelly visualize them (Iteration: draw an n-polygon or growing objects, Recursion: Snowflake like fractals, and so on). If your child catches on, you then can ease in into something more sophisticated.",1290765705

I didn't find it much interesting but it gave me some idea what programming is about [1]. Then in my teens I started learning C++ - and it was a real struggle. Only in the beginning of 2010 I discovered lisp language family (including racket) and I instantly loved its purity [2]. I wish I could start with it, it would save me much time and frustration. In fact I think I'm going to teach some basic racket to my 10 year-old cousin.<p>[1] Well, I was 7 years old that time so it was basically something like realizing concept of programming language as a way of communicating with computer<p>[2] Well, I'm no a lisp expert but they seem pure comparing to C/C++/Java when you write some beginner level programs - no cryptic things like type declarations or pointers",1290765614

The things you list (car, computer, other consumer purchases) are not personal deductions under the US tax system.<p>Relatively few personal purchases are deductible.

Only 41% of American taxpayers file a return listing the deductions above (""itemize""), usually because they carry a mortgage.<p>The other 59% just take a single deduction (""standard deduction"") of about $5800 per adult (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deduction</a>).<p>Finally, if someone found legitimate ways to deduct the things you listed (for example, they were unreimbursed business expenses), they would run into the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).

Firstly, how do we trust any news source on a case like this when the press is controlled by the accuser?  Second, even if the sentence is 'legally correct,' when does the threat of a human rights violation become too important to ignore - should countries be pressured to abolish death sentences (at least) for non-violent crimes?  Even if the death penalty is the 'official' punishment to fit the crime, certainly it's a big problem if the actual delivery of that sentence is relegated to a minority of cases in which the government is motivated to prosecute.  Of course selective prosecution is a problem with any legal system, but when the sentence is death it is all the more important to monitor cases through a transparent system.  It doesn't seem that this kind of transparency is in place.

I've been developing in C and Java for 11 years now.  I make a tad under $100k and live in Atlanta, Ga.  I have yet to need to know or discuss failure modes of the GC by heart, how to detect them and work around them by heart, how the JVM team did generics and possible alternatives, nor to know keyboard shortcuts by heart.  I have however come across these things in my career and had to takle them.  Guess what I did? Googled. Then I got back to writing code, what my job soley exists for.<p>It seems absurd that any company would require these things.  If I was interviewed at a company asking me to talk about these things in the interview, I would walk out simply because I would feel it was completely irrelevant to how good of a software engineer I am.  I really hate being interviewed by people who are more interested in asking obscure questions that just want to prove how smart they are (when we all know they probably just looked up that question/answer before the interview), rather than talk to me about coding and problem solving.<p>Things like memory use, basic algorithms, what design patterns are, collections, code quality, software development life cycle, unit testing, general coding problems, maybe some things about hibernate (if you use it), basic database knowledge, their favorite language and why and let's not forget overall personality and how they will fit into your team are far more important areas to cover.  Not some obscure questions that will be used maybe once in your lifetime or on extremely rare occasions at the new job that can also be looked up on google when you need an answer for that rare occasion.<p>I even shutter when I think about design patterns being discussed because they're so over used and bad developers focus way too much on putting well known ones into their code base even when it may not be called for and just create so much more bloat for no good reason other than to feel like they're smart.  An understanding of design patterns is great, but forcing people to describe any of them but the well known basics is just dumb.<p>The interviews my team gives exist around these things and I can honestly say we have yet to hire someone that didn't know their stuff very well and fit into the team nicely from the start.<p>I have only been without a job for a max of 3 months when I was laid off once and I have job hopped a lot, especially in my early career (which, there is a dirty secret there... That's how you make more money when you're staring off!). I have walked out in the middle of interviews before when it was clear that the person was asking obscure questions just to feel superior.  I don't want to work with people like that...<p>Interviewers need to focus more on asking questions that software engineers face on a daily basis and less on odd and obscure things that can easily be researched in a short amount of time online when and if the problem ever presents itself.<p>I apologize if I got off topic or missed your point entirely.

2454140,comment,2453895,2453895,93,0,grellas,,,"A few observations:<p>1. This is a sleeper case (i4i v. Microsoft) that has drawn relatively little attention in the public's eye. In reality, the stakes associated with it are <i>huge</i> and the interest it has drawn from key players in the tech industry is commensurate with those stakes.<p>2. The reason it is not a particularly exciting case from a headline standpoint is that it deals with what appears to be a specialist technical issue of patent law, that is, what is the proper ""standard of proof"" to be applied when a patent is challenged as being invalid? Should it be a ""clear and convincing"" standard or a ""preponderance of evidence"" standard?<p>3. In fact, the <i>practical</i> effect of this case on patents will be far greater than that of, say, <i>Bilski</i>, which dealt with the question of what constitutes patentable subject matter. <i>Bilski</i> covered business method patents only. The <i>i4i</i> case affects basically every case pending in the courts in which the validity of a patent is being challenged.<p>4. Among those in the tech world, just about everybody who is anybody has weighed in with a ""friend-of-the-court"" (amicus) brief asking the Supreme Court to throw out the clear-and-convincing standard in favor of a preponderance standard. The parade includes Google, Apple, Facebook, Intuit, Yahoo, Intel, Dell, HP, and others. A group of 36 law professors specializing in IP have also asked that the standard be changed, as has EFF. A superbly informative summation of the amicus briefs seeking to undo the clear-and-convincing standard is found here: <a href=""http://www.law.com/jsp/cc/PubArticleCC.jsp?id=1202472695453&Patent_Litigation_Extra_Heavy_Hitters_Back_Microsoft_Supreme_Court_Bid_in_ii_Case"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.com/jsp/cc/PubArticleCC.jsp?id=1202472695453&...</a>. A good discussion also appears here: <a href=""http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2010/09/challenging-the-clear-and-convincing-standard-of-proof-for-invalidating-patents-in-court.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2010/09/challenging-the-clea...</a>.<p>5. By the way, the other side of the argument is well-articulated here: <a href=""http://ipwatchdog.com/2011/03/13/supreme-court-patent-watch-i4i-files-brief-in-microsoft-case/id=15745/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipwatchdog.com/2011/03/13/supreme-court-patent-watch-...</a>.<p>6. So why is this so important and why do some companies (such as Apple) that frequently rely on patents to protect their competitive positions side with Microsoft in wanting to make it easier to find patents invalid? The simple answer: trolls. In essence, when a patent's validity is challenged and a jury is instructed to uphold it unless it finds ""clear and convincing"" evidence that it is not valid (owing to whatever ground, whether it be obviousness or existence of prior art or any other recognized ground for declaring a patent invalid), the challenge will almost certainly fail in the average case. The jury is basically told that the patent is presumed valid unless they can clearly find compelling evidence to invalidate. Since, in most cases, what is offered is conflicting evidence of varying types, jurors (typically not wanting to sort through a maze of technical evidence) will simply shrug their shoulders and say that the patent stands. If, on the other hand, the jurors are instructed that they are to determine the issue based on which way the preponderance of evidence tips, then they are to give no deference to the findings of the USPTO in upholding the patent but are to look at it fresh to decide whether the evidence shows that it is more likely than not that a patent is invalid. Thus, under current standards, trolls come into court heavily armed with law that says, in effect, uphold what the USPTO did unless you find a hellava reason not to. Microsoft, and the other tech companies, want this changed so that trolls have no built-in advantage when it comes to a litigated dispute over patent validity, i.e., they want a ""level playing field"" once the fight is on.<p>7. On the technical issue, patents laws are governed by statutes enacted by Congress but no existing statute requires that a clear-and-convincing standard be applied to this issue. The parties dispute the issue but Microsoft's position is that no such standard had been applied by federal courts (at least not with any consistency) before Congress created the Federal Circuit court to oversee patent disputes. Microsoft argues that the Federal Circuit has skewed patent litigation by arbitrarily making it more difficult to invalidate patents than Congress had intended. This was the same court, by the way, that had adopted the <i>State Street</i> test that led to a wild proliferation of business-method patents and that was struck down in <i>Bilski</i>. The Supreme Court is now being asked to bring a bit more sanity to the related area of standards for determining patent invalidity.<p>It is hard to say which way this one will go. The patent bar is in an uproar that issued patents might not be deemed presumptively valid when challenged but might be much more vulnerable to challenge going forward, and so too are the trolls. Pretty much everybody else favors reform, including most of the tech industry heavyweights. My own sense is that this one is going to tip toward Microsoft and that we will get some measure of reform here. This would be a significant and very practical step toward undercutting a good measure of the power currently held by the trolls.",1302968757

2454067,comment,2451729,2451729,1,0,hackinthebochs,,,"Since no one saw fit to attempt to actually answer your question (don't you just hate when people feel the need to give you their opinion rather than answer your question), I came up with something: Talk to him <i>all the time</i>. There was an article a while ago here (or maybe reddit) that studied the amount of words a child hears before certain age between lower, middle and upper class groups. The difference was massive. Upper class children heard a huge amount more words by a certain age (I don't remember the exact range, I'm guessing in the hundreds of thousands). This difference showed up in much improved language skills for the upper class child.<p>Anecdotally, I've noticed this first hand. On my commute to work I've noticed how different classes interact with their children (as approximated by race). Black and Hispanic parents tend to give some distraction to the child so they don't bother the parent, or are themselves distracted by a cellphone thus ignoring the child. While white and Indian parents (likely middle to upper class by context) tend to constantly interact with the child, asking questions, speaking in complete sentences, etc. Just always having a conversation with them. The differences were stark.<p>Another idea I picked up recently was to constantly attempt to give your child age-appropriate decisions to make. This will train them to be able to weigh options and decide on the best course of action for themselves. The example I heard was when you're at the store, give the kid the option to buy two snacks--absolutely anything they want. But just two. This may help them develop decision making skills.<p>One more idea is to attempt to train their ability to delay gratification. You may have heard of the ""marshmallow experiment"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment</a>) where a child's ability to delay gratification as a young child was correlated with their ""success"" as adults. Try to run the marshmallow experiment in your home as a standard course. Let him have a bigger payoff if he can show self control for some period of time: food, learning, whatever it may be.<p>Good luck with your future genius!",1302966505

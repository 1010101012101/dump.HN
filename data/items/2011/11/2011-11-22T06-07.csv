Most of the teachers in the lineage I belong to are also psychologists, psychotherapists or counselors (but your teacher is NOT your therapist). Stephen Bachelor has been a Tibetan AND a Zen monk, but is now neither. He wrote a book called ""Buddhism Without Beliefs"" which might suit you.<p>Note though that it is almost impossible to separate meditation as it relates to your mind, and meditation as it relates to your bodily actions. When you start to understand the way your mind works, and how everything fits together, you would have to be pretty ignorant to not alter your actions accordingly. Indeed, using your brain 'more effectively' can only happen by applying what you learn.<p>(IE, there is no state that you 'attain' and from then on you are 'more effective'. Meditation is a 'practice' and so you must practice it, you don't attain anything at all)<p>edit: correcting misspelled book title. Should be ""Buddhism Without Beliefs"" not ""Buddhist Without Beliefs"".",1321945114

TeX and LaTeX are complex pieces of software, that are developed over time. They were extended as the capabilities of their platforms increased, to take advantage of those capabilities. This requires full access to the OS utilities, and naturally LaTeX environment does that. If anything, this is Apple's fault. For whatever reason, they cannot allow applications to use the existing capabilities of the underlying OS. This goes against the Unix mindset; of course there will be unpleasant consequences, but one cannot hold Unix mindset responsible for these.",1321945069

It is annoying to have all pages javascript generated, clicks hijacked to make some special sauce, and content popping in, up, down or out whenever you hover something. It is a growing mess that will have it ""let's rollback and clean this crap out"" time, like Google did with its famous blank home page.<p>Another example: trello.com is a very nice and free card tool for small projects, but because they wanted to avoid having an ""edit"" button on editable text, they hijack my clicks, so it makes it painful to select text, and quite impossible to use ""middle-click as paste"".<p>But, there is a more positive perspective liked to Google+. In fact, I think the midterm result of Google entering in the SNS arena could (and should) be to force open Facebook. I mean, right now G+ is not open, it doesn't have all the needed APIs, and this is probably OK because they they need a critical mass before opening, and one should not bash them for testing, pondering, adjusting a bit more before releasing some important changes. Time is on their side anyway.<p>But in the end, they will go, I hope, the full good-old Google way, which means:<p>- Read/write APIs for posts, followers, followees, etc.<p>- Ability to dump all data and go away<p>- RSS or similar subscribing hooks<p>These tools will allow a much higher interoperability for social content, similar to interoperability of emails today.

Richard Berwick, San Francisco native and Berkeley undergraduate student, has been an entrepreneur since he was 12 years old; through his entrepreneurial efforts he has been able to finance his studies so far.<p>From a young age Richard discovered that clearance items in stores would often sell for 70-90% less than what they would sell for online. With this knowledge, Richard scoured the clearance racks of retail stores all around the bay and then posted his findings on the Internet to sell at a higher price. Watching a kid cram twenty cinema projectors into his car was a strange sight for store managers but as long as they were moving products, they were happy. Over time, Richard developed a strong gut sense for how much an item would sell for in an online marketplace. Armed with this skill, Richard has been able to generate enough income to pay his way through school. Today he is working with a team in the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology (CET) to make an app that allows others to replicate his success.<p>The team of six students working on the project have come together from a variety of backgrounds to create a phone app that makes the buying and reselling process easier. They understand taking the risk of being unable to resell inventory is not for everyone, so they came up with a workaround. The app allows sellers to walk into a retail store, scan a discounted item, and post it for sale on Clearance Karts online marketplace for 30 minutes. The hook: users dont have to purchase the item until they have a confirmed buyer -- almost like a risk-free version of eBay. The teams goal is to make mini-entrepreneurs out of the sellers.<p>To see more visit clearancekart.com.",1321944432

I'd leave it to them to decide what ""reasonable"" means, maybe something like falling within a certain range of amounts (perhaps making the offerer specify this beforehand?), with argument content that passes a cursory review.<p>I'd at least suggest that they manually review ""bets"" that pass a certain threshold of page views and/or challenge requests, and tried to determine whether the bets were proposed in good faith or not, up to and including interacting directly with the people offering the bet and asking them for explanations about why the challengers didn't meet their requirements.",1321943794

Identity management and permissions management for who can see a user's content just don't have a good standard yet. Therefore private companies are rolling their own proprietary solutions and competing with each other.<p>At some point, the standard techniques for dealing with these issues will become Standards. This is a well worn path. Html was a standardization of the previous 10 years of work on markup languages, plenty of them proprietary. There are other examples... ODF standardizing on XML and cloning established MS Office functionality... etc.<p>Real Standards that could address the article's concerns are only reasonable when NO innovation is necessary, merely choosing a methodology that has already been built and proven to work in practice. IMO, Java more or less committed suicide when it started a standards-first innovation process, which resulted in many multi-year projects doing design-by-committee of an api before anyone tried to build an implementation or an actual product on top of it.<p>As long as G+ is introducing features not available elsewhere, the fact that it's a currently closed system just isn't a reasonable criticism.",1321943676

You should understand things like process management, e.g. ""&&"", ""||"" and subshells.  You should also understand file management, e.g. "">"", "">>"", "">|"", and the program ""tee"".  These help with testing because you frequently have to write scripts and organize output files, and you have to understand how the system handles things like failed programs.<p>When testing it's quite common to have to deal with lots of files and do filtering.  Think of how you'd organize data.  Reuse things like scripts for driving tests.  Learn tools like ""grep"" and ""diff"" and ""sdiff"" and a scripting language like ""perl"" or ""python"".  For example, it's very common to need to automate test audits by filtering out volatile data such as time stamp lines and comparing the remainder against a set of golden results.<p>Learn at least one widely-used testing environment, such as the ""unittest"" and ""doctest"" modules of the Python standard library.  It doesn't matter if your company will use something else, it's useful to pick up on some terminology (e.g. the concepts of setting assertions and creating standalone testcases) and to see how at least one framework does things.<p>Practice being pessimistic.  For any given system, don't let yourself only test the ""easy"" stuff; try to think about weird things that could happen.  Boundary cases are often very useful, e.g. what happens when -1 or 0 are given as values, or very large numbers.<p>Practice editing.  Tests should be extremely focused because when they fail you want to know exactly what went wrong.  This kind of focus also helps outside the world of testing.",1321943284

That's why at a certain point in the hierarchy, these firms don't promote people unless they have MBAs-- because they know the people with MBAs have been formally taught to network and are vetted.<p>It's the reason the partners earn 30-50%+ of the case fees ($500k/month) even though they're 1/6 to 1/10 of the FTEs.<p>Anyway, the pitch process is gated right now by whether the partner knows the CEO or executive at the potential client. They may know them from b-school, through a friend-of-a-friend from b-school, through another partner at the firm, etc.<p>Perhaps, much like AngelList has democratized deal-flow for early stage investors, something similar may crop up for corporations looking for strategy work that would let more lightweight firms bid for the work. And those firms could attract the most capable because they'd distribute the fees much more evenly.<p>Who knows though this is all speculation and thought out in a matter of minutes.",1321942165
3264338,comment,3264223,3264223,8,0,tdicola,,,"Some general thoughts (I was a software engineer in test for a few years):<p>- Be a good developer--all the advice and best practices  for software developers still applies to you.  Much of your job will be coding automation, test suites, integration tests, etc.  All the best practices of writing solid, readable code will definitely be useful to you.<p>- Work closely with your fellow developers.  Have them code review their checkins with you so you understand how their code works.  Find out what they think are risky areas to target.  Help them understand how they can write more easily testable code.  Don't fall into a trap of developers throwing code over the fence at test, and test throwing bugs back at them.  Everyone is in it together to ship a quality product.<p>- Understand how your customers use your product and make sure their usage is covered in your tests.  It's easy to look at a spec and start trying to test all of the inputs, edge cases, etc.  It's better to understand how your customers/partners will use a feature and make those your highest priority tests.<p>- Try to catch bugs as early as possible.  Automate your test execution, run test passes against changes/checkins, and alert yourself when changes cause new test failures.  If you let too many bugs get into a build you'll waste tons of time sifting through hundreds of failing tests to find the bugs.",1321942153

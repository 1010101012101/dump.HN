4321536,comment,4321229,4321229,6,0,DigitalSea,,,"I'm only 24, but I remember when I was 12 having a chemistry set that had some pretty crazy chemicals in it. There wasn't anything crazy like uranium or other chemicals that could create amphetamines, but I do recall blindly mixing ingredients in a test tube, blowing the top and bottom of it out and covering a portion of the roof in the mixture which then proceeded to burn through the paint and etch the wood. I remember my dad painted like 5 coats of paint over the top and it kept showing through, those were the days.<p>Don't get me started on the excitement of burning magnesium ribbon, my kerosene powered Bunsen burner that I almost burned down the wooden front-deck with when I accidentally knocked it over, experimenting with beakers and filter paper... I feel sorry for kids these days who won't ever get to experience the fun in mixing semi-dangerous chemicals together in a test tube or beaker, I believe my chemistry set is what made me become the programmer I am today.<p>My chemistry set kept me out of trouble as a teenager because blowing things up, playing with chemicals and fire wasn't new to me, I was desensitised to it all when I was young and the thought of blowing up a car battery or soda bulb paled in comparison to magnesium ribbon or an explosive chemical cocktail mixture courtesy of my chemistry set.",1343804299

4321530,comment,4319638,4320341,1,0,gojomo,,,"As a Verizon tethering subscriber, this decision will save me money... but I can separate the principle from my particular situation. Summed over all cases where a popular bit of price/service control is dictated by a federal agency, and also quite possibly in this particular case, the results are likely to be net-negative for consumers. So I'd rather regulators never intervene in this way. Their decisionmaking apparatus is unable to limit itself to the few reliably beneficial cases, instead intervening in many other cases that are just superficially attractive. On the other hand, if these sorts of differential pricing schemes get chiseled away over time by competition -- perhaps by giving other companies and technologies the marketing hook they need to make inroads, because after all packets <i>are</i> packets -- consumers win other benefits. Even if it takes more time than an 'FCC rescue'.<p>(I am the Bitzi gojomo!

It's something that would certainly be fun to play with and that we have all the information to do--chemical reactions follow established rules and exceptions could be hardcoded in.<p>I've thought about an organic chemistry chemical program. If you're not familiar, a huge component of organic chemistry consists of memorizing and understanding reactions and their mechanisms, and reactivity of organic molecules.

One were it is stock-option motivated and the other were progress in the company is the motivation.  Now they should and you would of thought that they would be one and the same.

The complexity and intricacy of the music keep my brain going even if I'm stuck on a problem, so I rarely get up from my workstation. I just lean back and close my eyes, letting the cascading melodies wash over my mind. A solo or two later and I'm back on the keyboard.",1343801069

On the way back to my room, I started to feel dizzy and noticed my eyesight fading. First it seemed to go black and white, then to tunnel-vision, as if I could only see what was directly in front of me. My hearing faded as well - I was on the verge of collapsing (unbeknownst to me) and I could hear my family shouting out as if I was listening to them through a poor AM radio signal and speaker. My father grabbed me before I collapsed and hit my head on the corner of a desk.<p>After going to the doctor, we determined the causes:<p>* Standing up too quickly (jumping straight out of bed)<p>* Low blood pressure<p>* Possible dehydration<p>* Going to the bathroom<p>The trick to prevent passing out when you start feeling dizzy is to get blood flowing back into your head. The easiest way to do that is lie on your back and lift your feet high in the air. And of course, keep hydrated and avoid standing too quickly.",1343800992

They probably wouldn't put it this way, but I think they needed time for some of the less desirable user base to flee the site in order to start up again and be respected. I remember what happened after v4 was launched, and you couldn't read the comment section of any story without it being about the redesign. If you have a bunch of people complaining about a redesign instead of focusing on the content first, no one's going to even consider coming back, let alone joining for the first time.<p>It's no secret that the community needs a reboot, and content-first development might work for a site that through any other implementation might just strike people as a poor version of Reddit (regardless of whether or not that may be true).",1343800945

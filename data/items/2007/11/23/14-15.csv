But saying that code is ""elegant"" is the same as ""quality"".  <p>Can the person who writes the code be the authority on whether it is quality code? If one of the most important aspects of quality code is how easy it is to maintain or extend.  Shouldn't it follow that code shouldn't be considered good until it's maintained or extended.  \n",1195829519

And what happens after 10 other programmers modify your slick little multi-return function?  Nobody will ever be able to modify it again because the entries and exits are lost among the garbage.  This is the ongoing debate I've had for years with ""clever programmers"".  They're missing one critical point:  the guidelines of structured programming are not meant to make your life easier; they're meant to keep the code alive longer by making life easier for the poor schmuck who has maintain it (usually me).<p>Another Sign You're a Crappy Programmer:<p>You make your own rules in direct violation of effective established principles because you think you know better.",1195829393

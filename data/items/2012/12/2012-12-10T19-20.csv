I can easily test my models/controllers but to verify that the app HTML isn't borked I have to rely on strict HTML compilation tools (like HAML) and/or slow/painful frontend integration tests that require button clicking, HTML parsing, and form-element filling.<p>I've always wanted a higher-level way to author and test HTML and I always come back to a more programmatic/declarative way of generating HTML as the best way.

Sure they can make some money this way, but Apple's profit per device is in the $250-$300 range.<p>Is there any argument to be made that Google can somehow go from making $1.63 to $300? Not to mention that Apple and Microsoft are also making that tiny ~$1 per user from their stores and search as well.<p>All of this also doesn't count the fact that running the store isn't free. That revenue isn't 100% profit. My argument is that while they can grow this ARPU, I don't see any possible way that it becomes a big enough number to matter compared to their search profits.

Genshi has to have a different construct py:if for conditionals.  Heist doesn't need another construct.  A function call serves both purposes.  This has several positive effects.  First, it means Heist's core is simpler since it only has one fundamental abstraction that has enough expressive power for implementing all of Genshi's special case keywords.

It just seems to me to be a very common complaint in most modern games. I still play Team Fortress 2, and even though they've implemented AI, the AI only works on certain pre-designed levels. Yes, I know that a FPS is generally more path-computational than a RTS, but if you're proposing that an RTS have 3D terrain then, well, that makes it a 3D game, no?<p>And it's been awhile since I've designed a game but I think you're underestimating the computational power it would take for an AI to dynamically generate efficient paths with every change to the terrain. IIRC, a lot of early AI compensated by having pre-calculated paths for each level (and I think virtually all of them only pretended to be encumbered by a fog of war).<p>My point still stands though...these aren't really innovations...again, I'm not in game development, but I'm guessing that some of these are ideas that teams consider and then drop in lieu of their difficulty of implementation.

NAND storage SHOULD be significantly cheaper than rotational storage since it is cheaper to produce, requires fewer exotic materials, has a far wider market, etc.  And eventually it will be.  But for now, there is a huge premium on NAND storage.

Then we can make assumptions about the next word (eg it's likely a verb) and immediately the number of options for the next word collapses from 200,000 to a subset of some smaller cardinality. In fact we can use our knowledge of common English to restrict the next options down further -- to only verbs that make sense to this particular noun and that agree with the noun's plurality.<p>So unlike current password brute forcing, where every character is independent of the others -- thus having exponential complexity -- brute forcing a sentence using current NLP methods could be much less expensive. Perhaps a hierarchical method exists that would scale at O(n log n).<p>Anyway, this is just fun thinking.

I can't say I agree in this case.<p>You had terrible, awful expectations.  You expected your employees to be dedicated to the benefit of your clients rather than themselves?  This is capitalism.  People have jobs because those jobs provide THEM a benefit.  Especially today, where you as an employer make ABSURD margins of profit off of everything your employees do (as worker productivity is astronomically high thanks to computers and such - just ask yourself how productive your company would be if you banned any technology produced after 1980.  Couldn't survive, could you?  Yet, companies did.  And they paid their employees the same average wages you are paying now.  You're just getting far more benefit.)<p>Pick up a book on capitalism.  It's likely not what you think it is.  It is not workers making as little as possible sacrificing everything for corporate praying that one day they'll win the lottery and become CEO.  That's not capitalism.  Capitalism is based on free exchange to mutual benefit of both parties.  Your clients use your business because it benefits them.  You tend to your clients because it benefits you.  Win-win.  Your employees work for you exclusively and only because it provides them substantial benefit, and you provide them that benefit because you make profit off of them.  Win-win.<p>Expecting a worker to be dedicated to your company above their own interests is disgusting.  You would not in a thousand years consider cutting your projected profits in order to improve their salaries, so there is no reason whatever for them to display any loyalty to you.  Workers do not exist to work.  They are human beings who exist to seek their own enjoyment, and if you as an employer fail to provide adequate pay/benefits/etc they will leave you to fail on your own.  That is how it should be.<p>There is an escape.  If you really do want to build an organization with invested, loyal coworkers, you can.  The first step is to read a book on capitalism.  Understand what a persons compensation is supposed to be based upon.  It is not supposed to be based upon market average rates.  It is supposed to be based upon the value of the work being done.  If one employee earns a million dollars for the organization, that employee deserves most of it.  If you want people to be invested, you have to actually make it in their best interests to do so.  Right now, it is explicitly AGAINST their interests to be productive for you.  It can't help them, and can only cost them.  You'll cap them out at what they can make based on 'market rates'.  And the chance of them rising to senior management is an invitation to self destruction with no payoff.<p>Employees are not going to be dedicated to the poisonous cesspit modern business has become.  Just not going to happen.  It's not your fault, and it's not theirs.  And you cannot fix it while maintaining the kind of absurd growth figures and profit margins that modern businesses are taught to expect.",1355168260

When it became OS X, the BSD emulation layer was updated to 4.4BSD (from FreeBSD) and the Mach part was updated to Mach 3.0.

In this study, they equate presenting violent concepts for inclusion in fiction as being indistinguishable from actual aggressive action.<p>A great deal of the social discussion surrounding violent media is poisoned by people who insist on denying that there is a difference between fiction and reality, or, more often, using words with two radically different meanings.  They say something like ""children have sex with hookers and then run over them, murdering them"" in their description of a videogame.  They are not claiming, of course, that the players physically did have sex or murder anyone, but they realy ENTIRELY upon you assigning the same negative connotations to the actions as you would to the real physical actions.  If you stop and ask why murder is wrong when it involves two fictional characters, you either quickly find out that it simply isn't, or that the person speaking has no capacity to define WHY murder is wrong in the first place and so bases their entire worldview on seeing words like ""murder"" as a quasi-mystical totem portending danger.",1355167078

When a flash drive fails, you can still read the data. A clustered database and multiple copies of the data, you gain reliability  a server level of RAID. As drives fail, you replace them.</i><p>Unlike magnetic disks, SSDs have a tendency to fail at a really predictable rate.  So predictably that if you've got two drives of the same model, put them into commission at the same time, and subject them to the same usage patterns, they will probably fail at about the same time.  That's a real problem if you're using SSDs in a RAID array, since RAID's increased reliability relies on the assumption that it's very unlikely for two drives to fail at about the same time.<p>With an SSD, though, once one drive goes there's a decent (perhaps small, but far from negligible) chance that a second drive will go out before you've had a chance to replace the first one.  Which makes things complicated, but is much better than the similarly likely scenario that a second SSD fails shortly after you replace the first one.  Because then it's possibly happening during the rebuild, and if that happens then it really will bring down the whole RAID array.<p>That said, if you're careful then that predictability should be a good thing.  A good SSD will keep track of wear for you. So all you've got to do is monitor the status of the drives, and replace them before they get too close to their rated lifespan.  If you add that extra step you're probably actually improving your RAID's reliability.  But if you treat your RAID as if SSDs are just fast HDDs, you're asking for trouble.",1355167025

I find it pleasing to look at and it's easy to use.<p>The WebOS UI is clean compared to Android, but years behind iOS. I was excited to try WebOS when I got a discounted TouchPad last year, but really disliked how unpolished the entire thing felt. Text selection was abysmal. Actions were often hidden in menus. Animation was not smooth or coherent. Cards is a cool concept, but I don't think it improves usability significantly (at least not significantly more than four-finger swipe).<p>> * System-wide Mute - When I go to a meeting or other environment I need a full system-wide mute. On Android I'll turn down the sound only to have an annoying notification sound go off in a meeting because notification volume is still at 100%.<p>Again, not an issue on iOS. Couldn't this be fixed with an app in Android (honest question, people always talk bout everything being replaceable in Android).<p>> * ""Home button"" - switches to card view and shows the application launcher. This means that a single button works for 1) closing apps, 2) switching apps, 3) launching apps.<p>This is largely the same in iOS, but the priorities are different - 1 click to launch new apps, two clicks to switch/close apps.<p>I put CM9 on my TouchPad because development was stagnating on the TouchPad and I was really surprised how B-grade the entire experience is - even compared to WebOS. An iPad is fast, consistent, clean, and works out of the box. Besides cost, I really don't see what people like about _using_ WebOS or Android over iOS (philosophically I understand, pragmatically, I just can't get there).",1355166690

When there is certainty, probability is nonsensical.<p>While I think YC may be quite adept at choosing only people over 6'2"", people in general are not very good at knowing if they are over 6'2"" in entrepreneurial talent. We know people are very bad at judging their own competence, and generally vastly over-estimate it. There is no tape measure for entrepreneurial competence. Unfortunately, I'm not sure anyone, even the YC partner group, is able to reliably measure future success, though I'm sure you are much better than most investors.<p>Further, an enormous amount of luck is involved, as demonstrated by the large number of one-hit-wonder entrepreneurs, the vast range in outcome for similarly talented people, as well as the large number of impressive entrepreneurs who never really succeed.<p>So I do think it makes sense to apply probability to your chance of success, no matter who you are. Very talented entrepreneurs still have a high chance of failure, and there is also a good chance that someone is not as talented as they and others think they are. We all know people of both types.",1355166157

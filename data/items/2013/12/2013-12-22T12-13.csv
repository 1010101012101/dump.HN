This is statism, which has been on the rise off and on through from the 20th century onward and has taken a significant uptick in the last few decades. Even in the freest countries there has still been a rampant diminution of personal responsibility and individualism in preference to state control, regulation, legal expansionism, and so on.<p>The war on drugs is a big part of that. But other things are too, things that people still have a hard time grappling with intellectually. Labor laws and the welfare state, for example, tend not to actually benefit those at the bottom, they tend to benefit those at the top, no matter the intentions. But in the meantime, a lot more of our money is taken under government control, and a lot more of our daily activities as well.

They don&#x27;t send anything commercially sensitive that an attacker&#x27;s going to be interested enough in to try to intercept their messages.<p>The use of encryption <i>presupposes</i> a motivated threat, and it&#x27;s not clear to me that the NSA is significantly more powerful than other adversaries in that area. They&#x27;ve more computing power, more political power, they can buy zero day exploits. They probably even have some very smart people, who can find flaws faster than the attackers in civ-space. But speed isn&#x27;t required, only persistence; motivation, interest. Which is, after all, what we&#x27;re supposing in the first place if someone&#x27;s going to go to the trouble of intercepting your messages.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that unless your goal is <i>&#x27;make something that the NSA can&#x27;t break into&#x27;</i>, you&#x27;re going to make something that a well motivated attacker can&#x27;t break into either. And this stuff only has to be broken <i>once</i>, then they&#x27;ll just sell or share the attack. The conflict is asymmetrical.<p>Your argument seems to be posited on the idea that there will be no attacker; no-one anywhere, ever; sufficiently motivated to breach the protocol. And I find that highly questionable, given that a flaw has already been found - and with far lower levels of incentive than will be present if the system is widely deployed and used to protect valuable information.",1387715043

6950120,comment,6948117,6949167,1,0,Articulate,,,"I think you are overlooking some serious changes to the way the Fed regulates the money supply in the last five years.  They are printing over 85 billion dollars every month.  The stock market is soaring... why? because the government is artificially controlling interest rates which makes the value of your dollars go down fast- so people are forced not to save their money in a bank account but instead put their money &quot;into&quot; the economy- wealthy people are putting it into hard assets, and people that don&#x27;t have as much are dumping money into the stock market as a hedge that their savings is loosing value every day. The result is a market that looks like it is doing great but is quiet volatile itself.<p>I agree that we should be very careful to just suddenly start running around yelling &quot;the sky is falling&quot; but I have heard an economist at the Fed (during a banking townhall) say &quot;We are in totally uncharted territory&quot; referring to how they will pull back all of the liquidity they have pumped into the market.<p>As for your comment about the US government saying &quot;Use US Dollars or else...&quot; that may not be the way that it looks on the surface but the US Government is very heavy handed in how other countries are allowed to control their own currencies, how multilateral trade deals are written in terms that force other countries to give up control over their own monetary policy.<p>You are correct that individuals around the world views the US dollar as stable and prefer to keep at least some portion of their wealth in US backed treasuries- but I would caution anyone from thinking that this is a foregone conclusion.<p>The fed uses a few people to try and hit multiple targets all at the same time... they have to deal with a bureaucracy that favors age and longevity, they have political pressures (see the Greenspan article above), and they have to make certain that their decisions keep their institution (coincidentally not a gov&#x27;t institution but a private company)alive.

If you at all bother to understand your problem domain, and are not just a monkey at the typewriter, writing down a good domain model and adding the constraints is not going to decrease development speed, quite to the contrary, it&#x27;s going to increase it, web developers often spend whole workdays just tracking down in the logs the &quot;story&quot; of some now angry customer that happened to violate some unformalized assumption of the system and got mishandled later in the process, especially if this customer happened to pay already. Not to mention that with a good domain model, the code for the individual functionality flows out naturally, while with a shitty one, you might end up with three times as much code for the same thing.<p>Also, those mistakes in modelling the domain and in enforcing the constraints are often there to stay and slowly become impossible to fix, once you have 10000 records that do not fall into a few well specified states, it&#x27;s hard to go through all of them, find some common denominators, and migrate the database. Not to mention that with the mess people can do in the code, and with the messy stack in use today, it&#x27;s easy to introduce bugs that might be hard for anyone to notice but seriously harm your business.<p>The amount of fashionable nonsense in software engineering seems to be higher than ever, unfortunately.",1387714656

337826,comment,337495,337778,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>We definitely saw some crazy over-inflated housing prices, and we're now seeing a correction in many markets, but we're not going to see $400k houses dropping to $40k nationwide. Not even close.</i><p>You might be surprised by what you see if deflation comes into the equation. Even without, it's not unreasonable to expect a 50 to 80% decline peak-to-trough, given that (1) houses were 50-200% overvalued to start (good morning, Silicon Valley), (2) the economy is in recession, and (3) far-out suburbs/exurbs are likely to revert to ghost towns and ghettos as gas prices inexorably swing up. A decline of 90% is definitely in order for upper-tier Manhattan properties, although in that case we're talking about a haircut from $40 million to $4 million. So, while I think he's optimistic (from my point of view, heh) about the housing crash, I don't find him to be unreasonable.",1224507509

337813,comment,337541,337541,0,0,compay,,,"Merb has grown so large, I think at this point Sinatra is better for very small projects. Use Merb if you want something like Rails, but with better internals and more flexibility of companion technologies.<p>I see Merb as being like Postgres and Rails like MySQL. Both are good products. Merb is better put together from a technical perspective, but doesn't have the mindshare that Rails has. This means less plugins being created, and less search results on Google for your error messages. For advanced programmers this usually doesn't matter, but for beginners it makes Merb much less accessible.",1224506101

It seems like all the great investor-heroes of this century (Buffet, Philip Fisher, Peter Lynch, Bill Gross, etc.) say roughly the same thing: Buy what you understand.

So I think the ad is fair in that it discusses what MSFT is doing to Vista itself.<p>If MSFT's $300 million was spent telling consumers to hang onto XP and wait for Windows 7, that argument would be a little more persuasive.",1224505763

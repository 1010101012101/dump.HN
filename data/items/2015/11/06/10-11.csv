10518825,comment,10518304,10518793,0,0,cmdkeen,,,"And yet again the UK is not the USA, MI5 is not the FBI, Spooks is not a documentary.<p>The FBI&#x27;s handling of MLK, and the general culture of fear of Hoover in the political establishment, is an excellent example as it is all before any of this technology. It isn&#x27;t an argument against this, it is an argument for the effective oversight and regulation of the intelligence services. The USA might have some bizarre legal concepts in which the courts defer to the state when &quot;national security&quot; gets played but I can assure you that is not the case here. We&#x27;ve paid out settlements to the British Guantanamo detainees because trying their lawsuits would have potentially exposed intelligence relating to whether they were bad or not. NB nothing justified their treatment regardless of who they were.<p>It has always been the case that the intelligence services have the capability to destroy someone they don&#x27;t like. If they don&#x27;t have that then they&#x27;re not any good at their jobs. If you have a (rational) fear that they can that is an argument for reigning in that service, not hobbling their ability to do the things we do need them to do.",1446807531

Be it autism, depression, obesity, nearsightedness, and so on, medical research is wandering helplessly with different hypotheses being in vogue at different times while having no way to conclusively prove or disprove any of them.<p>The problem is that medical science is dominated by a particularly insidious misinterpretation of frequentist statistics which makes most medical research for most practical purposes worthles. It goes as follows: A study that looks at one possible cause is, all things being the same, a hundred timess less likely to produce a false positive than a study that looks at a hundred different causes, so we should make studies as specific as possible to avoid false positives.<p>The error in this reasoning is that while a study that looks at a hundred possible causes is indeed a hundred times more likely to produce a false positive, it also produces a hundred times more data, so the amount of noise is the same. So in an ideal world, a hundred small studies are perfectly equal to one big study, so it shouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal after all.<p>But we don&#x27;t live in an ideal world and studies that don&#x27;t produce significant results are often shelved, and studies that report results for one possible cause in fact looked at many and report only the most significant result. This makes it impossible to add up results from different studies to get a clearer picture and you only have separate studies pointing at random directions and leading nowhere, with no hope of getting more certain results untilt the way science is done changes.",1446807450

The history of &quot;entryism&quot; during the Cold War is well documented, and MI5 have declassified information about what they did and did not do.

They did not spy on merely left wing individuals.<p>We&#x27;re in an age of leaks, and there have been whistleblowers from the UK intelligence services. If MI5 were asked to spy on Corbyn you&#x27;d probably hear about it in the resignation letter of the head of the service...<p>Personally I do think Corbyn is a threat to national security.

But I&#x27;d far rather have a discussion about how as technology matures and becomes adopted by the masses we need to discuss how it fits into our existing legal and societal structures. Having rational debates about why something is or is not over-reach compared to say the government&#x27;s previous ability to inspect all mail that left the country is a valid discussion.<p>The web history one is an interesting one, especially in terms of &quot;the police&quot;. Oversight of the police has increased in the UK to massive proportions, I doubt there any other nation has the same degree of oversight in the world. It isn&#x27;t perfect and at times poorly drafted laws get over-used, but on the other hand it is updating a capability to the 21st century. \nOne example that is used, and as a former volunteer police officer one I&#x27;ve experience before - missing persons. Previously if you were reported missing I would have gone and looked through your diary, your mail, spoken to friends and family etc to build up a picture of where you might be, who you had spoken to etc. Now you&#x27;ll find a laptop and be stuffed. Perhaps you took your mobile with you - this isn&#x27;t a TV show, I can&#x27;t just go &quot;where is phone X&quot; and get an immediate response. If we find your body in suspicious circumstances, then we&#x27;ll start dumping phone data, or if you&#x27;re a child and missing, but otherwise it&#x27;s most aimless driving around looking. Fortunately the vast majority of missing people are repeat customers and turn up eventually, but I&#x27;d far rather loosen the ability for communications data to be used in those instances. But then of course the internet erupts as &quot;the police can track your phone and view your web history without a warrant&quot;...",1446806613

The UK has a strong history of an independent judiciary standing up to the state and of a government that has been legislating to increase scrutiny and safeguards for decades. This whole programme may have been under a &quot;vague&quot; law but it is covered under the law and the government is having a debate on making it clearer what is happening. \nIn trying to update old laws to the modern age I think it is acceptable to discuss what the limits should be, but also accept that old concepts of where the state can intercept communications should change not just be written off as &quot;oh well we can&#x27;t do that any more&quot;.",1446805514

Disputes can take years or even decades[1] to settle. This Bloomberg article[2] calls it &quot;horribly dysfunctional&quot; and having worked there I agree. You do not want to go to court. There&#x27;s many reasons for this, there&#x27;s about 14 judges per million people and the justice system is run like it&#x27;s 1940 - no computers mostly, massive piles of paper, etc.<p>The World Bank ranks India 178 out of 188 in contract enforcement[3] -- essentially if you have a dispute, especially a small one, you may be better off cutting your losses. If you&#x27;re up against someone with patronage/influence your chances are even dimmer (which is why you need to have your own patrons/influencers if you are serious about doing business in India, which just perpetuates a bribes-and-corruption culture). It also causes people to take matters into their own hands, because if you suspect your employer won&#x27;t pay your salary, you can&#x27;t file a suit. It actually makes more sense to lock him up (as long as he isn&#x27;t harmed the likelihood of a criminal case is remote) until he releases the cash.<p>For companies for whom this is feasible, one common workaround is to add boilerplate to their contracts to be subject to Singapore courts for dispute resolution (much faster!).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=court+case+taking+decades+india"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=court+case+taking+decades+in...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-11-25/speeding-up-indias-courts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-11-25/speeding-up...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/india/enforcing-contracts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/india/enf...</a>",1446805444

If we look today at Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, we are not that far from that reality. The &quot;ad economy&quot; is at direct odds against an open web.<p>I&#x27;ll give you that Google&#x27;s breakthrough came because they could find a way to revenue, and that without ads they would never bring many useful things for fruition. But the best way to justify their wealth creation is that they manage to make the social function of advertising (connect producers and consumers) and make it more effective.<p>There was almost zero progress in that regards afterwards. It is just a race to the bottom. I can actually bet that we would be better off without these products, services and media if they were gone.

Here are the relevant passage.<p>Honestly it looks more like live rewriting of the FAQ to take into account the fact that Philae had a bumpy landing. I don&#x27;t see an intention to deceive. It&#x27;s awkward to present the document without mentioning it&#x27;s not the detailed mission objectives.<p>That maybe the `perfect ending` considering we have some data back and well.. it&#x27;s the only ending we have so rosetta exploding before philae could even be launched might have been labeled `perfect` too because it&#x27;s the first time we put something into the orbit of a duck-like comet.<p>They certainly wished they had more philae time though. That would have been even more perfect. I wouldn&#x27;t qualify this a `major failure` though (does the hostility come from that ?).<p>> <i>The science observations will start immediately. During the first week – the minimum mission target – a first run of the most important scientific measurements will be completed. During this phase the lander can operate on primary battery power, should this be necessary. In a second phase that is meant to last up to three months, a secondary set of observations will be conducted, using backup batteries that will be recharged by the energy from the solar cells on the lander. However, no one knows precisely how long the lander will survive on the comet.</i><p>And then:<p>> <i>The science observations will start immediately.

8611771,comment,8609775,8611190,0,0,lmm,,,"You know how GCC compiles mutable C code? It converts it into immutable SSA form, optimizes it in this form, and it&#x27;s only at the register allocation stage that things become mutable again - if two different reassignments of your variable end up compiling to the same register, at some level it&#x27;s only coincidence that they did so. So unless you&#x27;re doing handwritten assembly, you&#x27;re already relying on the compiler&#x27;s ability to optimize away redundant copies.<p>Why does GCC do it like this? For the same reason FP systems do: because it&#x27;s easier to reason about immutable values, and easier to optimize things you can reason about. In general the closer we can get to telling the compiler our intent, the better the performance we should ultimately be able to unlock. If we tell the compiler to create a loop variable and increment it, it has to do that (or at least, has to simulate the effects of doing that). If we just tell the compiler to apply this function to every element of this list, it has the option of being smarter about it.<p>There&#x27;s an argument that this will be much more important as the world becomes ever more multicore. In a multicore environment immutable values become much easier to work with because they can be safely copied around; with mutable variables your program can end up spending more time on synchronization overhead than actually doing things. I&#x27;m not sure how much I believe this, but it could explain the recent rise in popularity of functional languages.",1416063296

They have learned a lot from this, and they got to run tests with all of the equipment on the lander. Calling it a major failure is way off base. You often learn more from things going wrong than from when they go right. Maybe not the things you were planning on learning, but this is very far from a failure.<p>I also think you&#x27;re over-interpreting their &quot;minimum mission target&quot;. That was an &quot;if everything goes to plan&quot; target. Everything didn&#x27;t go as planned, but here&#x27;s the thing: that&#x27;s also in the plan.

Please state them or avoid uninformed claims.<p>Specifically, if the secondary batteries were supposed to be fully charged before, why would the non-rechargeable batteries be the primary batteries at all?<p>And technically, there are more primary batteries and more secondary batteries in Philae, the primary batteries having 1000 Wh, the secondary batteries having 140 Wh. Note that if you use e.g. 30 W during experiments, you use the primary batteries in some 30 hours. The scientists had to decide the rate of the battery use. Just like your mobile phone lasts only hours if you speak all the time on it. The lander being in the shade had different temperature environment than in the ideal case.

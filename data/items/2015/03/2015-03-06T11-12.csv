There&#x27;s no reason why the whole concept of <i>user facing application</i> couldn&#x27;t disappear on behalf of this style of interaction, where commentary is interleaved with active documents.<p>The first generation of software for non-scientists was based on a metaphor of office paperwork, where information workers created static collections of data (&quot;files&quot;). But computers now are powerful enough to support dynamic content deployed through the web on the fly (&quot;web apps&quot;), without requiring a long previous installation of supporting software , and there are much better compatibility standards than in the 60s, so the original constraints on software distribution no longer apply.<p>System-level software benefits from a traditional write-compile-execute cycle, where the result is a monolithic binary distribution that is then run over different data sets. But this model is not necessarily the best or the only valid one for user-facing software. Business workflows often work best by combining several small tools, à la Unix pipes.<p>A platform like the one described by Bret Victor which allowed end users to build active documents without requiring programming knowledge, using PowerPoint-like composition tools, could easily replace many pre-built generic applications, in the same way that Excel is used in offices around the world to replace small &quot;database&CRUD front-end&quot; combinations for small, specific, non generalizable workflows.",1425642709

It still makes it illegal for women to take safety measures like hiring a bouncer or driver to protect them from violent clients, or working together with another woman for the same reason. It also makes it a criminal offence to knowingly rent a flat to a prostitute. It&#x27;s almost exactly the opposite of harm reduction - it makes it legal to sell sex, but only in ways that are high risk.

9156601,comment,9156348,9156348,0,0,netcan,,,"When FB went public at that &quot;insane market cap,&quot; the IPO kerfuffle and all that followed, I had a few interesting conversations. I had been working for a while in online advertising, a lot of adwords and other ad platforms so I had a fairly good understanding of the forthcoming advertising product that was supposedly going to determine FB&#x27;s actual value.<p>Anyway, my take on it was this: FB stock (at the time) is mostly a bet on two questions. (1) Can they remain the major social network where everyone has a profile and logs in regularly? (2) Can they build an ad platform that makes money off that position. Most people were curious about #2, I think because FB delayed really finding out the answer until after the IPO.<p>For the second question, I thought &#x27;yes&#x27; was most likely. I had (and still have) a lot of confidence in the power of scale to add value to an ad network. The bigger the userbase, the more targeting opportunities you have. If you can limit your audience to people in their 30s, with kids,  within 5 miles^ and still end up with enough people to bother I think you have a valuable ad platform.^^ Anyway, the answer <i>is</i> yes. FB advertising is one of the world&#x27;s blue ribbon cash cows.<p>That&#x27;s the difference between millions and billions.<p>The first question though, I was (and am) less confident about. For FB to be a good investment it needs to last decades. Google has maintained its search position for a decade, but who knows if Facebook can in social. A lot of the forces at work are more cultural than economic or technological and unpredictable. Will it become uncool, unpopular. Will popular focus shift to some new shiny thing. It&#x27;s a much harder question. Maybe a reason to think that it can is if you think FB-size and network effects locks a service into position in ways that Myspace-size doesn&#x27;t. Maybe FB&#x27;s deep pockets will let them acquire, innovate, advertise and otherwise spend their way to long term survival. I don&#x27;t really have and <i>educate</i> way of guessing at this question.<p>^<i>Add in &quot;who are within 2 degrees of people that have visited your site&quot;</i> and you&#x27;re really cookin.<p>^^tangent: if you could combine a streaming TV service with Netflix-like penetration using FB login and FB ad targeting, I&#x27;d wager you could make more in ad revenue using only a small fraction of airtime than traditional TV. IE 10 second &quot;preroll&quot; ads, unobtrusive banner ads (on pause, buffer, etc) with FB&#x27;s targeting would earn more per viewer than traditional TV&#x27;s.",1425642535

Back in 2002 I was witness/participant to one discussion involving djb that made me think twice.<p>Because a great deal of software will not be able to handle Unicode (even now) there was some discussion back then about how to handle domain names in older software once domains with non-ASCII characters were allowed. If your software is assuming all ASCII characters, how do you display/handle a domain with greek or cyrillic characters? This obviously affects DNS and Mail software, so djb&#x27;s contribution should have been valuable.<p>The consensus from everybody else was a temporary hack: Punycode. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode</a><p>djb did not like this. He suggested all software should instead represent the actual characters rather than changing them because humans should be able to read them. He proposed this should be done through ASCII art. So if you were to register ααα.com (that&#x27;s three greek alphas if your browser can&#x27;t render them), all software should display this as:<p><pre><code>                 _
  /\/ /\/ /\/   /  /\ /\/\
  \/\ \/\ \/\ o \_ \/ |  |


</code></pre>
We has very serious, and got very upset when we pointed out this would require re-writing all software deployed to date, and if we were going to do that we&#x27;d just make it support Unicode properly.<p>My problem was that this idea was so batshit crazy I had to then question how crazy his actual implementations were. I dug into the source code of several of his tools.<p>I came away feeling that the reason bugs had not been found in his code were not because his code was bug-free, but because it is impenetrable noise.<p>As others have suggested here, it is uncommented, he uses a lot of pointer arithmetic, some parts don&#x27;t make sense. Making a contribution to improve it is difficult. Identifying if the code is correct or not is near impossible.<p>DJB&#x27;s code might be bug free, but it is also quite likely to be bug-ridden but nobody has been brave or bored enough to figure out where those bugs are.<p>I expect it does not have the same holes as BIND or sendmail (both of which are awful), but it will have holes.<p>The wonderful beauty of open standards and the work that the IETF has done of course, is that it means we have choices and if you want to run djb&#x27;s code, you can go and do that. If you don&#x27;t - and I do not - you have choices of other software that will inter-operate with it as expected.<p>I don&#x27;t hate djb, but I don&#x27;t trust the claims made about his code being watertight, and I do not believe somebody who writes code that is hard for others to understand is worthy of the title &quot;greatest programmer who has ever lived&quot;.<p>Good luck to him and all who use his code, but no thanks, not for me.<p>P.S. - if you want to see what good code does look like in an MTA, take a glance at the source for exim one day.

Why are you trying to squeeze between them?<p>I made an effort to clarify there wasn&#x27;t anything criminal about going from 1 to n, or with the companies that do that (such as Apple and potentially some of the YC companies).  Sure, that can be part of the cycle.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with &quot;tinkering and ... capitalizing on the tinkering of others.&quot;  There&#x27;s a lot of money in that -- and YC is quite clear that that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re about.  It&#x27;s an accelerator for making money.<p>But it&#x27;s not an incubator for innovation.  It&#x27;s not for those attempting to do something in the 0-to-1 space.  But without those people, the 1-n&#x27;s can&#x27;t do much.  Alan Kay famously asked on StackOverflow, &quot;Has there been any new innovation since 1980?&quot; and the answer was no.<p>Then we have to ask ourselves, &quot;What happened in 1980?&quot;  Right?  Where did it go wrong?  I suspect that it is, at least partly, when the money exploded in a distributed way.  There suddenly was a huge volume of customers asking to &quot;get something working today, it doesn&#x27;t matter how.&quot;  Fast forward to today and we have -- at this moment -- hundreds of thousands of the developers, including some of our top minds, writing applications in HTML/CSS/Javascript, etc.  And no one is laughing.  Almost every app written today is on a huge, ludicrously stupid stack.  And we smile and work hard to optimize it, without questioning the stack as a whole.  Everyone is still trying to get &#x27;something working today&#x27; because that&#x27;s where the money is.  At the last StrangeLoop there was only one presenter from the pre-1980&#x27;s: Joe Armstrong.  His talk?  &quot;We can do better&quot;  Everyone else&#x27;s talk?  &quot;How to optimize or manage this part of the stack.&quot;<p>Doug Englebart&#x27;s kids found out about his innovation from newspapers.  He never talked about it.  He said it was never about money or fame.  Alan Kay is relatively unknown and relatively poor compared to people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, who invented nothing but were better at marketing, and I don&#x27;t think Alan cares.  And isn&#x27;t that the adult way?  You give kids rewards: &quot;Clean your room and you get a cookie.&quot;  But as an adult, you just clean your room.<p>I think that before 1980, we got 0-to-1 revolutionary innovation because it was done for the reasons we do true science or art.  It&#x27;s not about childish rewards of money or fame.  Artists/scientists don&#x27;t do it for glory or gold.  They do it because the mountain stands before them.  Because they see a better world, they see something beautiful, and it pulls them forward.",1425641447

Ideas like the Fair Tax (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax</a>) generally include provisions to reduce the disproportionate effects on people making less money (and proportionally spending more to survive).<p>Taxing consumption also encourages people to save and invest. In my opinion, this is a much better base for a society than encouraging spending and not saving. Most western countries tax income less and consumption more than the US.<p>Disguise? There are no exemptions. A significant focus of the idea is to remove the politics, special cases, and loopholes around the tax system.<p>The 10th largest economy in the world functions on property and sales taxes alone.

If you go back to March/April/May of last year (<a href=""http://scobleizer.com/404"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scobleizer.com/404</a>) he was writing lots of great, smart, important essays.<p>Lately, I feel like it's more like startup diarrhea.

Since it's been operating semi-underground, I'm not sure anyone is 100% sure which leaders would end up dominating if it were to operate in the open and have some degree of power.

If DST simply committed to providing $150K to every YC company, at whatever terms were determined by the lead investor in the syndicate, DST wouldn’t be pricing the angels out of the ecosystem.""<p>I don't really see how this is pricing angels out of the ecosystem. SV/Yuri isn't taking the whole funding round for themselves (though they might in some cases, who knows?). Nothing is stopping other angels from continuing with the same terms they have been giving. Start ups raising a typical angel round (400k-1 mill) will still need more than 150k. With the 150k blanket investment it just means YC startups can wait longer to ask for it. Which is similar to what the original YC investment meant. This simply seems like an extension of their philosophy.

They spend a lot of time training for it, they spend a lot of money on equipment in preparation for it, and they spend a lot of effort setting up backup systems. When a mountain climber goes out on a glacier they typically do not go alone, with minimal equipment. They go in a team, each person wearing a harness and roped together. They each have an ice ax and have trained in self-arrest on snow and ice. If one person were to fall they have been trained to arrest themselves and save the faller by means of the rope. They may have practiced this many times. If one climber were to fall into a crevasse they will arrest, set up anchors, and set up a rescue system (using pulleys and extra gear that they have brought). Meanwhile, if the climber in the crevasse is still conscious he or she will attempt to do what they can to aid in their own rescue (up to and including ascending the rope). And this is just a small part of the training and preparation that experienced mountaineers take on when they set out to climb a mountain.<p>It does nevertheless take a good deal of courage and determination to work your way up a glaciated mountain, but the idea that there is no safety net or that the climbers do not think what will happen if things go bad is very misleading.

There's no way that Google would be able to bring to market every single idea that comes out of engineers heads.  So they let them experiment a bit in the early stages and then pick the winners once the teams have had a chance to survey the territory.<p>It's probably my biggest annoyance with working at Google, but I accept it because I know the alternative is worse.  If you never canceled projects, then the only things you'd be allowed to work on are Big Important Things blessed by some VP high up, things that are too big to fail.  That's how many other big companies work, and they usually end up with idiotic projects where it becomes apparent to <i>everybody</i> (except the VP) that the project is a waste of time, and yet they keep going because some executive staked his career on it.<p>BTW, startups face this problem too.  The equivalent to a canceled project is a failed startup - there're only so many new products that the market can bear, so consumers choose to put their dollars into the products that are most useful and let the others die.  The difference between this and the Google model is:<p>1.) You get to decide when to quit (or the market decides for you, if you run out of money).<p>2.) You don't get paid for the time you spend deciding.<p>For many people, this is a bargain worth making, but you should know that's the bargain when you take it.  I've been on both sides - I took a pretty nice job in a financial software startup for a couple years out of college, then founded my own company, then folded it up and went to Google, and won't rule out eventually founding another company.  The advantage of letting someone else make the decision of when to quit is that these people have had <i>lots</i> of experience picking winners, so once my head was primed with a few failures, I figured it might be a good idea to watch some folks who've actually had some successes and see what they do differently.",1296335438

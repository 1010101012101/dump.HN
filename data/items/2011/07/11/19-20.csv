2752260,comment,2751673,2751899,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"""Is anyone here surprised?""<p>Yes, somewhat. You have to believe really hard in something to do it as a startup. There are way more haters than their are believers in the usual case. So I would expect the executive ranks to be 'fanatics' in the sense that they have to believe hard enough to execute through to the complete vision. Once you've gotten there and the world decides they were right and you were wrong, <i>then</i> you go and try something else. So having someone as senior as the chief product officer step out at this point is surprising to me.<p>That being said, Color may be the latest example of the adage 'Don't take too much money.'<p>Brief digression. I once had an employee that wanted a promotion. I asked them (as I do anyone who asks me this question), what aspect of the promotion were they seeking? Was it more money? more responsibility? more influence over the decisions? And usually, yes, its one or all of those things. Then I ask if they are ready to be judged based on how well the project is going, or whether or not the right decision was made, or when the project had an unexpected side effect? That's really the rub isn't it? When a project turns out to be a turd, you fire the person who is 'running' it. So if you're willing to operate at that level then it makes sense to be promoted.<p>Startups are kind of the same way, in that money is the arbiter of impact/change. You take a $1M investment, create a product and are aquired for $50M that is a huge ""win"", but take $41M in investment and get acquired for $50M and you're a 'loser'. A good rule of thumb is ""can I create 10x the value with this investment?"" if not then someone is going to be disappointed down the road.<p>Color took a huge gamble when they took $41M in funding. That puts a <i>lot</i> of pressure on the founding team to develop clear value in the $300 - $500M range. Doing that is a <i>really  hard</i> problem. If it were easy we'd all be bazillionaires.",1310414394

I loved my Kindle when I had one, but after using the NST I realized how rough a lot of the edges on the Kindle are.  It really is a clear and solid step above the Kindle, and it's the device you need to compete with for e-ink.  Wifi vs 3g doesn't matter; nobody buys books often enough to really truly NEED 24/7 connectivity across the globe.  The NST touchscreen is shockingly responsive and totally obviates the need for a physical keyboard.<p>As for integration with Google Books--while I haven't used GB myself, I read a lot of Project Gutenberg books, and I'm assuming the two are similar platforms.  The problem with PG books is that the formatting is just awful for a lot of the ebooks.  Sometimes the person compiling the book will slavishly stick to a print edition, going so far as putting page numbers in or other print ephemera; or sometimes the internal coding is so bad that it only looks good on a small subset of readers; or sometimes the book is OCR'd and thus riddled with typos.  What I'm saying is, you get what you pay for--and a lot of the free public-domain ebooks are just awfully compiled.<p>Hell, even some books I've bought from the Amazon store have been very obviously OCR'd with no second thought to ebook presentation or editing--a big example is one of Stephen King's Dark Tower books, which are huge sellers that you'd expect to have been ported to digital with at least a little attention to detail.  Not so: the one I bought from the official publisher was obviously OCR'd and so riddled with typos and errors that I returned it to Amazon without finishing it.<p>So I guess what I'm saying is, I'm not impressed with this device.  It's a generation behind the Nook Simple Touch, and integration with Google Books isn't enough to interest me given the awful or non-existent editorial oversight in most public-domain ebooks.",1310413573

Composition pads are generally bulkier and glued together or spiral bound which is also pocket-unfriendly. I've got other 3x5 notebooks that are bulkier than the Cahier Journals and I just never take them with me. I'd probably avoid sitting on a binder clip too.<p>They also have rounded corners which help prevent the pages from catching on my pocket and getting folded/torn/ugly, and it has a nice inner pocket for receipts or other sources of notes. Superfluous, I know, but I like the cream colored paper better than white paper, and the plain cardboard cover develops a nice patina that other stuff generally doesn't.<p>They're about 3 bucks and only 64 pages each, which is quite steep if you write a lot, but I only go through one maybe every 2 or 3 months, which makes the cost difference negligible to me.",1310413423

Barriers to innovation and competition have proliferated in our last leading industries with RIAA, MPAA, and software patents.  The effects of building oil-dependent infrastructure have come home to roost with peak oil arriving in 2005.<p>The result is that America now offers about the fifteenth highest standard of living in the world.  We still have a much nicer place to live than China or Brazil or Russia, of course;  there are over 200 countries in the world so fifteenth is in the top 10%.  For the first time, though, America has been definitively passed by France, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, and other top quality of life nations.<p>The New York Times this week reported that Mexican illegals are now finding they have a better quality of life returning home to Mexico. [1]  That doesn't mean our quality of life has dropped below Mexico's;  it means the premium for being illegal is now greater than America's advantage at the margin.  There are even some classes, such as college educated middle income professionals, where quality of life in wealthier parts of Mexico is already objectively higher than in many parts of the USA.  (Mexico is probably about 35th in worldwide material quality of life)<p>Oil prices are still rising, congress is intent on more and more protectionism and supporting nationalized companies like GM, housing prices are still not rational, the banking sector is a more deeply entrenched oligopoly, old line monopolies that want to leach on the creative industries of coastal California by blocking broadband expansion and running patent shakedowns are in charge of the courts, it's still illegal to build the kind of low-oil walkable sustainable neighborhoods that would reduce oil import dependence as we aim for $10 or $20 a gallon gas, affordable local and high speed rail is still prohibited by federal (FRA) regulations that prohibit European and Japanese innovations here, congress and the president are playing chicken with national finances instead of trying to fix them, occupational licensing is on the rise, and I haven't even mentioned health care.<p>I'm not saying you should look into getting that Mexican work visa now and beat the rush.  America has many advantages still.  The state universities are the best in the world, the business climate is generally supportive more than parasitic or bureaucratic (a surprisingly rare thing in other nations), the labor market is still relatively flexible, the nation is a uniquely large market united by a common language and currency, the dollar is stable (for now), we have the best natural open land preserves in the world, and the people are entrepreneurial.<p>We're not going back to undisputed number one but America can do fine among equals.  If you want to go somewhere else though, you don't have to give up your income and luxuries anymore;  just don't expect to lord your superior citizenship over the locals who are -- on average -- richer than you are.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/07/06/world/americas/immigration.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/07/06/world/americas...</a>",1310411768

However, go to any random city in, say Europe, the middle east, or Asia. Chances are high that you will easily find artifacts from the roman age until now. Most of the US is new, in many cities you'll have to work hard to find something older than one hundred or two hundred years old. This is not a criticism, but many people appreciate cities and artifacts that are old ;).<p>Also, with respect to culture in the other sense, the difference is huge. US city centers tend to be boring (with notable exceptions such as New York), since much of the activity is in the outskirts, and are only reachable by car. Compare this to many other countries, where city centres are cramped with pubs, small theaters, etc, and people tend to hang around until the early morning. I liked some cities int this respect (e.g. Portland), but in comparison it's still a bit dull.<p><i>The United States also has new culture such as ragtime, jazz (various genres), blues, soul, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and hip-hop music that compare favorably in the aggregate to traditional music from anywhere in the world, </i><p>It's just marketed a whole lot better. E.g. I am into jazz mostly, and American musicians are the most well-known. But Europe had (and still has) a lively avant-garde scene, which was at least as progressive is the scene in the US. In Africa, mostly isolated and in parallel, what resembles modern jazz developed (e.g. check out the excellent Ethipiques series). One good example is Getatchew Mekurya from Ethiopia, who developed his own weird flavor of jazz, that sprung directly from traditional ethiopian music. Anyway, I digress. The rest of the world had thriving and progressive music scenes, but often failed to package is for mass consumption.<p><i>broadcast media and motion pictures that were largely invented here</i><p>Are you kidding?

We've also got the ""don't say something stupid, the natives are very smart / clever / motivated and deserve your respect"" factor, the ""ask yc news/ask pg and almost always get intelligent actionable feedback from experienced hackers/entrepreneurs"" factor, and the ""if I have an idea and demonstrate talent I might get noticed / funded, so I better not say something really stupid"" factor.<p>Releasing data is a '?' - if it can be suggested that it may be a means to arrive at some sort of method for automatically/technically ensuring the community doesn't move toward the same kind of mob mentality, that's fantastic, let the heavyweight theory guys find something cool to do with it. If that fails, there's still moderation, and a strong desire to perpetuate the high signal to noise ratio here.",1203788511

At my university(San Jose State Uni), about 40 students have taken the xml and web intelligence course, which seems to be towards data mining and ontology.
Also keep an eye out for vague topics, and go and speak to the prof and find out what he intends to cover during that semester.",1203788117

I replaced a keychain LED with an IR LED but the switch is a simple squeeze and it is incredibly hard to turn it on and get a good signal, so when I'm trying to calibrate it, I usually accidentally click twice and have to redo it. Does anyone have a good idea for an IR pen?",1203786991

122081,comment,122047,122076,0,0,rp,,,"You just described the underlying problem with a suit such as this. There is a concept called the ""business judgment rule:"" if a shareholder sues the board for a breach of fiduciary duty of care, a court is unlikely to second-guess a business decision if it was made in good faith and was informed. So, the system does give deference to the judgments of the directors. Its existence is just buried deep in the folds. :-)",1203786196

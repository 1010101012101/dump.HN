They're formed out of the ashes of the old, and great, management team from The Planet (before it kinda went 'eh') and are good value and really progressive (extremely customizable machines, cheap upgrades, virtual private LAN for all users, KVM for most servers, IPMI logins, open API to control your servers, etc). I moved to them from EV1 several months ago and am totally in love. It's amazing for startups because they offer datacenter level options for dedicated hosting money (it's worth it for private LAN alone, I save tons of bandwidth).<p>If you want more general comments, rather than specific vendors, then... unless your site is entirely local/regional, then always host in the US. Always go for something that's not the cheapest, but not the most expensive. Always search WebHostingTalk.com for reviews of the company you consider.",1180306275

24986,comment,24959,24960,0,0,antirez,,,"IMHO the best thing to do is to take a cheap housing. Here in Italy where prices are much higher than in the USA you can get a decent host with a big disk, few GB of ram, 1Mbit of guaranteed bandwidth for 100 EUR / month, including the price to hire the server.<p>It's very important to have a good Linux distribution like Debian or Ubuntu where you can install/upgrade things in few seconds with apt-get.<p>Also it's important to have root to be able to install different apache modules, install cron jobs, be able to manage the firewalling in case of attacks (I saved myself from a DOS thanks to a Tcl script + iptables one week ago).<p>Virtual servers are cheap but the performance may not be bright.<p>p.s. I suggest to use a very low TTL for your DNS records so you can switch ASAP if there are problems. Also to try to ""packetize"" your application is important in order to make sure you can install without too much problems your code in a different host in little time.",1180305107

This article turned out to be targeted at big company types, not entrepreneurs ...'</i><p>I think the below extract could / should be applied to any startup. The point being made here is to create cheap in-expensive (money and time) rapid prototypes. In the process discovering new insights.<p>    <i>'... Sketches, he argues, are quick, inexpensive, disposable, plentiful, offer minimal detail, and suggest and explore rather than confirm ... The value of sketching is less in the artifacts themselves than in the cognitive process of working through dozens of ideas, of considering as many options as possible, and allowing each option to raise new questions ...'</i><p>This particular technique is extremely useful when the next step, <i>""translate design to code as quickly as possible into a working prototype""</i>.  Speed from idea to code allows crappy ideas to be exposed faster and is a technique (rapid development of ideas into code) was used by Joshua Schachter for various projects leading up to delicious.<p>I think the article and the book are slanted towards big business because they have less constraints (more money, resources) and hence have problems tackling the design process.  It might also be written for companies that do not create product and either make money by the hour or contract, not product ~ <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FiveWorlds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FiveWorlds.html</a>",1180304619

Every time a homepage loaded, Friendster's servers calculated a single user's connection to other users within four degrees of separation, which could mean hundreds of thousands of individuals.</i><p>And nobody had a clue this would not scale in 2003?<p>When there are 6 billion people in the world who are 7 degrees of separation from each other, they thought it would scale to calculate 4 degrees of separation, forever, each and every time somebody loaded any profile?  You mean the creator worked for Netscape, and knew a company could have millions of users in a short period of time?  You mean to tell me they didn't even implement alternate ways to display friends just in case they had to, due to sudden growth or multiple server failures, etc?",1180304363

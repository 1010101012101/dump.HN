Eg. if I want to know more about tattoos, I won't go to Flickr. I just get pictures of tattoos at Flickr. At Fotonauts, I'll get to see the photos and relevant content about tattoos.",1221216623

They will become much more useful when/if there is a standardized API with per-app isolation and access control.

302287,comment,302077,302283,0,0,halo,,,"I have the opinion that the 'misunderstandings' largely consist of either preconceived notions of what the ad campaign would be like or, more commonly, anti-Microsoft sentiment repeatedly raising its ugly head and any Microsoft advertising campaign would not please those people. I think the ads are generally quite strong - kooky, memorable, unique and a talking point... if not particularly funny (FWIW, I didn't find Seinfeld funny either) and a little long. I think they do the job they set out to do well.<p>So, I would ask you (and, as an extension, the Hacker News hivemind):<p>What would make a good Microsoft ad campaign that the collective Internet would have actually liked and not heaped scorn on? Note that this pretty much precludes mentioning Vista positively in any way anyhow...",1221215429

302283,comment,302077,302077,0,0,binarray2000,,,"The fact that both ads have been understood in so many different ways (here, on the blogosphere) shows that the message isn’t clear and in marketing that means trouble. Thus, being funny (for some more, for some less, for some not at all) or being talked about isn’t going to improve Microsoft’s image or sell more licenses (in particular of the problem child Vista). Apple, with the Mac vs. PC campaign, has a clear message besides being funny (not to me, but many like it) and being talked about.",1221214265

6742418,comment,6740796,6742209,6,0,lambda,,,"The problem with every visual programming language that I&#x27;ve ever tried is not that it&#x27;s aimed at novices and I&#x27;m afraid of being labelled that way. It&#x27;s that there&#x27;s a whole wealth of tools for dealing with text based programming that just can&#x27;t be used with visual programming languages without a huge amount of effort (if at all). Visual programming languages don&#x27;t work well with revision control; they usually don&#x27;t have diffing and merging tools. They don&#x27;t work well with grep.<p>They tend to have a fairly low information density on the screen. When looking at a simple program that all fits on a single screen, that&#x27;s fine. But when working with an actually real world code base, when I don&#x27;t understand exactly what it&#x27;s doing, I need to be able to see as much on screen as possible at once to keep it all in context, while browsing through to figure out how all of the pieces link together. All of the empty space taken up in a visual language makes it a lot harder to get as much information on the screen at a time.<p>And the programs can frequently be quite hard to follow. Tracing all of the wires between different nodes, figuring out what&#x27;s stacked on what.<p>There&#x27;s a reason that despite the very obvious circuit diagrams you could represent electronics with, hardware engineers for integrated circuits don&#x27;t use a visual tool for laying out their hardware, they use Verilog or VHDL, only compiling it down to the actual netlist and laying it out at the very end.<p>I have never seen a visual programming language that I would say could scale to anything beyond a few basic demos, which could just as easily be accomplished in a page of code.",1384552571

A very basic form based app can be better served by a phone gap app, and be of better general quality.<p>But the case where you won&#x27;t be helped by a cross platform solution are numerous. It is obvious if you heavily need performance or rely on a lot of native API where you want very fine grained control (you might even not want feature parity between platforms, if some platform give better tools than an others), or use native third party libraries.<p>But even in cases where you require near pixel perfect layouts for a wide range of devices, or have unusual set of rules to position or move your elements, handle  device rotation in non standard ways. In these cases you might be better off doing native apps as many times as you need to.
It seems extremely wasteful, but dealing with hacks on top of hacks in a single HTML+CSS+js codebase relying on an extra abstraction layer enclosing wildly different platforms is a hell in itself.<p>edit: spelling",1384551820

However, if I were building the game again today, I&#x27;d just do what King does and have the client manage the state. It turns out that the set of people that would do this and the set of users that would convert into paying users has very little overlap. The overhead of managing state on the server is that you&#x27;d have to write your game logic twice (once in your client-side language and once server-side, though with a scripting language you may be able to avoid this). Second, we benchmarked this approach and found that you can handle 10x the number of players with the same hardware by not doing any server-side logic/validation and just having the server be a dumb pipe to store player state.<p>Here&#x27;s a talk I gave on the FarmVille approach:

The greater ones power, the more numerous one&#x27;s enemies become. There are different reasons why this occurs. In some circumstances it is because those individuals did things that were illegal and face either prison or death at the loss of power (typical of an absolute ruler, Saddam Hussein, Robert Mugabe.)<p>Groups of individuals can behave similarly in shared self-interest. Private citizens and corporations can also be viewed as behaving the same.<p>What separates government from the private citizen or group is the general ability to use lethal force, theft, and imprisonment over very long periods of time and on a massive scale. Historically the relinquishment of power is generally one of a transfer of power, or some other bargain; sometimes through outright force and demand (Magna Carta and subsequent events, etc.)<p>The private citizen and corporation is certainly capable of using lethal force, theft, and imprisonment.

If it&#x27;s WebGL, it&#x27;s still entirely custom, with entirely custom event handling, and entirely custom accessibility (or lack thereof), and entirely custom <i>everything</i>. If you are just using WebGL, which is what they said, then the browser is a massive chunk of dead weight that&#x27;s doing jack shit.

Yours is the <i>typical HN top comment dismissal</i>, not mine.<p>On top of this, your criticism is not even valid. Let me explain why.<p>You clearly have never given birth with or even assisted in an obstructed delivery? Corks, prototypes, and dummies are not made to fit as tight as an obstructed birth canal and do not even try to replicate this scenario.<p>If you&#x27;ve read the article carefully, and paid attention to the details you would know the live births used are no evidence that his will work when it is actually needed.<p>><i>So far, the device has been safety-tested only on 30 Argentine women, all of whom were in hospitals, had given birth before and were in normal labor. </i><p>So the diameter of these women&#x27;s birth canals were far larger than typical obstructed ones because they had given birth before. They also were in normal labor. There would be far more room available to use this device when it is not actually needed. Try shoving something like this down and around a curved surface with an obstruction preventing it&#x27;s passage. The material would have to be very stiff, but to curve properly around the head and face, it would have to be very flexible. These things are mutually exclusive. Even if you managed to get it worked into place eventually (without it folding over someplace) it would take a fairly long period of time to work it into place. Suction is very quick to attach and is often used when that baby is already in distress (needs to come out in a hurry).<p>Here are some more reasons this won&#x27;t work.<p>Sizing. Babies craniums are vastly different sizes. Either they will need 8 sized of these hanging on the wall, or the inflation part will have to allow for dramatic size differences. If there is only one size, and the baby&#x27;s head is small, you are increasing the size of the object that needs to pass through the canal by a large margin (Actually adding to the problem). I suppose that big hospitals could have 8 sizes of these on hand, but not third world midwives.<p>If there is enough room for this thing to fit on, there is enough room for the Dr or midwife to just use their hands. This is far better anyway as they will have far more tactile feel.",1384550324

Implementation starts with caniuse.com, followed by ripping out the feature later when browsers support (or partially support) features differently across tablet, desktop and mobile form factors.

Once, the co-founder of one of the most important security companies told me &quot;do not expect to receive a bounty without sending a minimum of 10 emails explaining the same thing in 10 different ways... average 20&quot;. It&#x27;s a sad truth, and I think this means that usually legit critical security issues reports will not be properly rewarded because most people get tired quickly.<p>One year ago I discovered a session hijacking vulnerability on Facebook, the guy who respond my messages didn&#x27;t even know what secure flag is. After asking me how to solve the bug (the solution was actually pretty simple) they never replied to me again.<p>With Google was the same thing: last year I found leakage of sensitive user information because of bad cookies configuration, 0 bounties 0 thanks.<p>Another bad experience I had with Google, but maybe a bit of topic (sorry): almost two years ago the gmail&#x27;s cert changed for apparent no reason using a new CA, and it seemed that nobody else was having this issue (ie no mentions of this new cert on the web, googling the fingerprint returned 0 results) except me. I accepted this new cert on my laptop in my home; but then the &quot;funniest&quot; thing happened: when I connected to gmail from my university the previous cert appeared again, &quot;it&#x27;s ok.. nothing strange is happening here&quot;, but then when I went back to my home the new cert showed up again! my paranoid level went to over 9000 and immediately I connected through Tor to gmail (yup, the old nice cert was there again) and sent an encrypted mail to google&#x27;s security team explaining everything, with the fingerprints and certs info, _including_ at the end of my message my pgp pubkey.
One week and a half latter.. I received an email from the &quot;security team&quot;: they replied my message in plain text, my message was quoted unencrypted (!) and they asked me how I discovered this, I told them that my browser checks for every new cert. I also told them if it would be possible to not quote in plain text encrypted mails. Then, after two days I got a new email from them, again plain taxt, and it was pretty minimalistic &quot;We checked out and the new certificate is ok&quot; EOF no digital signature no nothing, wtf! 
oh well... at least on the next day I connected to gmail in my home and the old good cert was there again :) (and the strange new cert never appeared again). A late Halloween story.",1384549488

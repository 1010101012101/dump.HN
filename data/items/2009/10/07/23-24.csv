(Reducing the number of SQL queries by 100X in my experience.)  I've written one in Smalltalk that lets you declare the sub-graph of the object model to be batch retrieved as just a list of accessor methods.  Before that, I pair programmed with another Smalltalk ORM author while he was fixing another framework.  And at my previous job, guess what they had -- <i>another</i> Smalltalk declarative batch retrieve framework!  (The last one was written for TopLink)",1254959881

Classes are clearly something that almost every JavaScript library uses. We make those things language features instead of library features.<p>The unique feature we add, and the reason we really have to introduce a custom syntax at all, is dynamic message passing. Message passing enables all kinds of cool new features, because method implementations aren't bound until the message is received.<p>If you really wanted you could do this yourself:<p><pre><code>     objj_msgSend(anObject, ""message:"", aParam);\n</code></pre>\nBut clearly this is much cleaner:<p><pre><code>     [anObject message:aParam];\n</code></pre>\nObjective-J is not compiled really, it's translated.

Selects and updates of nested data can be as responsive as any range query on flat data, and when it comes to managing the performance of inserting new nodes, deleting or moving subtrees, there are a lot of options depending on what you want to optimize for (like spreading out the range from 1 to the max integer supported and periodically re-packing; that way, inserting leaves and any kind of deletion is as fast as with flat data).<p>I'm curious about what your nested data looked like. Sorry to get distracted on a minor point, but I'm intrigued! When I'm developing, I just always <i>feel</i> as though I should only worry when I start seeing data that has to be a graph and can't be represented as a tree, but as long as it actually <i>is</i> hierarchical then I won't have to worry about speed too much; but now I'm wondering if that intuition will bite me.",1254958831

I have no reduced ability to generate ideas (and possibly more ability to think up more substantial ideas).  I have an increased ability to grab a particular idea and give it further thought. I have the ability to consider if right now is a good time or not to act on an idea, and if not, then make a note of it for later.<p>You seem concerned that you'll have fewer creative ideas popping into your head; you need to consider of what value are those thoughts  if they are constantly replaced by the next new idea, and you cannot find the wherewithal to take a specific idea and properly act on it.<p>I really can't see the equivalence of racing thoughts with creativity.  Nor valuing  mere quantity of ideas over deliberately acting on even a fraction of those ideas.<p>Do some research on the near-term effects of Adderal and consider trying it.

I was also misdiagnosed with Parkinsons, MS, and Alzheimers earlier in the whole process - based on brain lesions, tremors, memory loss, paralysis, etc.  Misdiagnosis of complex, multi-systemic diseases is much more common than one would expect.  I would encourage anyone diagnosed with any of these diseases to get a fast second (or even fifth ;-) opinion before you start any treatments.

There's a big difference between books and reality. I'm not going as far as edw with his ""modeling controls the discussion"" (e-gads! Get this man a UML primer and be quick about it!) but there's a long, long way from a guy peddling a book to a guy you'd actually want helping you to do anything.<p>I'm not throwing books out. Not by any means. Lots of my friends have written software books and I'm peddling one myself nowadays. Got a bookcase full of some good and some not-so-good books. But it's a medium, and the medium has its quirks.",1218592788

274647,comment,274622,274622,0,0,cperciva,,,"From the article: <i>And San Francisco has its share of heartless landlords. One extreme example is the terror tactics allegedly employed by property owners Kip and Nicole Macy, who were charged with numerous felonies earlier this year for, among other things, cutting the support beams from one tenant's floor, burglarizing another's apartment, and cutting off utilities to another.</i><p>The key word here is ""allegedly"".  As in ""alleged by a tenant who doesn't pay his rent and is fighting eviction"".",1218591923

274645,comment,274571,274571,0,0,ardit33,,,"Interesting read.  I don't know the author, but it seems he practiced a lot yet fumbled some.  Which can be normal, as writing code in a whiteboard is just not natural.  To test raw coding skills, it would be a better idea to provide or have candidates come with a latop with their favorite dev enviroment/IDE/editors so they can code in a more realistic situation, the way they do every day.<p>It is always a good idea to get a good refresh of CS basics, and algorithms, and more advanced stuff as data graphs,  but at the end of the day, (if the interviewers are good), your raw skills will show up.   Just like math, skills are built in top of each-other and show with time, an you can advance more if you internalize low level abstractions (pointers, linked lists, hashtables, etc).  You can't just pick a book and learn these things in few days.<p>But a 9.5 hrs interview is grueling and a tad exessive, also tells something about the company that you are joining.  If they like interviews that long, means that have some huge bureocratic internal processes.   Interviews by 3 technical people, and one manager/product manager should be more than enough to spot a good a candidate, within a 4hr time-frame.<p>Anymore than that, it is just a waste a time.",1218591671

274640,comment,274112,274522,0,0,gojomo,,,"It's an 800-word op-ed column. The essence of the form is generalizations, vague trend-spotting, and suggestive questions.<p>You've also deceptively misquoted the article to make it easier to mock. Brooks' actual question is ""What happens if collectivist societies, especially those in Asia, rise economically and come to rival the West?""<p>There's a lot more nuance to that question than your rephrasing, and Brooks is just as aware of Japan, Singapore, and South Korea as you are.",1218590941
274639,comment,274016,274201,0,0,13ren,,,"Intriguingly, bike shops do not sell long sleeve tops (that protect you from sunburn) - but surf shops do. Cyclists have told me that they don't get sunburn - even when cycling in the sun all day. But surfers do get sunburn. I'm not sure what to make of this.<p>I'm theorizing that cyclists are somehow protected by constant movement (unlike surfers waiting for a wave). Perhaps the airflow is protective? Or perhaps it makes cyclists aerobically fitter, and this makes their skin more resistant to sunburn (and therefore skin cancer).",1218590886

274636,comment,274155,274293,0,0,rudyfink,,,"Coming from the South, I'd say it really would depend.  Making shit in your garage or shed is practically a God given right in the South.  I encountered more people there who regularly made things than I have in bigger cities.  I think people would feel toying around is certainly all right if done on your own land and in a way that your screw up will only cost you your own life or property.  That said community tolerance of tinkering is related to cultural norms.  Things that are really ""bad"" will get people against you  (eg better booze is fine work where better meth is certainly not).<p>Honestly, I'd guess the article's kind of regulation or enforcement is probably more correlated with population density than anything else.  The more packed in people get the more concerned everyone is about someone mucking up the finely tuned dance.",1218590404

People are not up in arms because these features still work:<p>- The telephone itself (i.e the feature where you actually talk using words and the words come out the other end)<p>- SMS<p>- Exchange syncing (the only reason I bought the iPod touch software upgrade)<p>- Webmail using the spectacular browser<p>- The apps for facebook/twitter/IM/etc<p>The twitter echo chamber effect is astonishing.

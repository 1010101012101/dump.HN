It is essentially a very light contract between the employer and employee - writing a contract about how there basically are no rules probably makes everyone feel like they are forward thinking but helps very little.  Here are some tangible examples...<p>- There is no rule on vacation so my coworker ""John"" takes a lot of vacation.  Hes pretty responsible about it but sometimes he's out and we really do need him - its begun to frustrate me a little.  Is he about to be fired or can I do this too - Im doing a ton of work but would like to go to Europe for 6 weeks?  (The problem here is that there is a very real limit on vacation - the limit is a magical number/level of output in the founders/investors/manager's heads and may depend on their mood day to day.  What one's expectation of acceptable time off may not match anothers.)<p>- I like to wear unqiue clothes but now a couple coworkers have started to tease me in ways that are really starting to bother me.  (As a side note I think this was part of what occurred with that Kixeye debacle while it was a vary extreme case.)  Lets see what the handbook says... oh.<p>- ""Tim"" produces like crazy - the problem is that he is not big on communication and doesnt want to be apart of our meetings.  Hes doing great work - its just not integrating with the direction everyone else is going.<p>It probably sounds like Im advocating for the other extreme where every detail is mapped out.  Im not - it can be too extreme on structure but I dont think the other extreme is any better.

We taught a class together while I was a PhD student in economics at Emory. I first heard the Coke story during his presentation during a fly-out weekend before starting graduate school, and it is to date still one of the most interesting economic stories I've ever been told. The question is simple, thought provoking and appealing to almost anyone.<p>The poster (Symmetry) that said ""the relevant basket of goods is the inputs in materials and labor that go into a bottle of Coke"" is absolutely right, and that's exactly what Levy/Young point to in the academic paper. However, the puzzle that remains is that input costs still don't explain the [lack of] variation in the price of coke over the relevant 5 cent years.<p>Although the CPI/inflation answers seem to be the reasonable explanatory variables here, the most explanatory factor is pretty simple: menu costs + marketing contracts/agreements.<p>Menu costs, which are the costs associated with changing your prices, used to be a pretty popular topic in macroeconomics. However, as time has gone on and with the rise of the Internet, menu costs have lost a lot of their explanatory power since they are far less significant in a digital age. But of course, in the early 1900s changing your price, especially for a good which was widely distributed at the time, was a pretty costly matter. Tack that onto that the agreements over price (but not quantity) that were made when the early licensing deals were made and you have a completely reasonable explanation for the sticky price of Coke.",1353023069

The problem is that most software engineers are indeed unskilled (and therefore few companies are willing to start interesting projects that might make use of skill) because high-quality work is so rare. It's a vicious cycle and open-allocation is the only way I can see of breaking it.<p>If they're intrinsically motivated, engineers are worth millions per year. If companies left them alone and were able to capture even 10% of their true potential, they'd do better than any closed-allocation shop.<p>There's an indirection that occurs whereby engineers apply to companies-- not specific projects or work sets-- and (until they've been at the company for a while and can change jobs without embarrassment) relinquish their right to choose what they work on. (A certain once-great search giant is notorious for abusing opacity.) They have no control over how they start in the company, and if they're not especially socially skilled, this will determine what kinds of projects and opportunities they get in the future. This indirection gives a lot of power to middle managers, who don't have the vision or inclination to design and allocate work in a way that would enable engineers to have real careers and improvement, and the result is an industry where stagnation, burnout, and middle-age obsolescence are the norm.",1353022733

So the net effect, assuming excess solar capacity, is that <i>carbon output has been reduced by a factor of two</i> (actually a bit more than two in practice).<p>And of course then the market will accomodate, such that ""day power"" being available in higher quantity and with higher excess capacity becomes cheaper and ""night power"" more expensive.  So the legacy coal plants will probably still even make money as they're selling into a ""premium"" market.<p>So... how is solar (or wind) a toy in that scenario?",1353022125

Moreover, Id make it clearer the posts users are seeing are for New York as it is a little small.<p>Likewise, since youre initially targeting New York users I would place a landing page & ask users to signup via email to express their interest  you can use browser detection to ask them for their region OR simply just ask them.<p>In terms of acquiring users & growing Yoink itself then, I would implement the following strategies:<p>- SEO<p>This is a HUGE section but, I would definitely look at your On Page SEO to making it more Local & to improve some issues.  For instance I would probably have Yoink operating from /new-york or /nyc  you should have a look at how Gumtree.com (eBay owned) are operating their site structure for Cities in particular.<p>SEO should be driving a large volume of traffic to your website which is why, I was emphasising the importance of HUGE in terms of the depth for this comment & the importance to Yoink.<p>- Social<p>Once again this is another strategy you should be using more effectively yet it feels like its an addon to Yoink rather than fully baked into the product.  You should work on making it more baked into the product by encouraging people to post to Twitter/Facebook/StumbleUpon etc when theyre offering something, encouraging them to post when theyve Yoinked something (in fact I dont know if you do this but you should offer to integrate the services & provide the option to auto-tweet when they post on Yoink or Yoink something but give users a Yes/No option) or offering a leaderboard or something This Months Top Sharers/User Referrers etc youd be amazed what people will do even for a $10-$25 voucher!<p>Likewise, you only have Twitter & Facebook  you should add Pinterest, StumbleUpon etc as well to encourage sharing & even a send via email to your friends option as well.<p>These are two strategies that are extremely important to the success of Yoink however, there are others you should integrate because; if there is an algorithm update etc you dont want to be losing the bulk of your traffic overnight. \nAs a result you should look to implement the following options into your growth & user acquisition strategy<p>- Advertising & Partnerships With Sites In Your Niche<p>- Bloggers & Other Webmasters Within AND Outside Your Niche<p>An example would be to use Guest Posting  since youre targeting New York only look for popular blogs related directly to NYC or read by a lot of NYC users.<p>- Offline Marketing<p>Word of Mouth will be your biggest source of traffic which is why you need to encourage your friends to tell everyone about it as well as, even produce flyers & network with Students (the biggest lovers of all things free!)<p>- Online Communities<p>Go to where your audience is and leverage them discover relevant forums, blogs etc and leave thoughtful comments and participate in their communities then leverage them to grow yours!<p>- Social Media Channels - Twitter, YouTube etc<p>- Email<p>You noted that Freecycle send too many emails but a daily/weekly email with site updates & cool favourite new postings etc will encourage people to come back to your site and us the service.<p>- Effective Site Branding<p>- Have a Blog<p>As well as guest post, create a blog & post interesting but relevant content which will have people engage with your posts from inside/outside of NYC (adding a landing page & getting their email address as highlighted earlier is another reason to try and grow this as large as possible). Posting posts such as 10 Things Youd Never Believe Are FREE But Are! and highlight things offered by Yoink users would encourage it to be shared (it the things are cool or shown to be cool  I saw an underground dinner highlighted when I was browsing that sounded cool to users!) which will aid in the growth of your service.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/Yoink/status/269142284522635264"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/Yoink/status/269142284522635264</a>",1353021582

You need to understand that; otherwise you will drive yourself crazy with all the things that politicians say.<p>In this particular example, the president can issue orders that control how <i>government agencies</i> operate, so long as they do not contradict a law passed by Congress. He can do this because he is the executive charged with leading government agencies.<p>What he cannot do--what only Congress can do--is issue an executive order that controls how <i>private companies</i> operate. He does not have direct legal authority over what private companies do; only Congress can set those laws.<p>The way presidents nuance this is to order that government agencies are only allowed to do business with private companies who do things in certain ways. This way he can influence any companies that want to do business with the federal government (which is a lot of companies). He's not ordering them--he's offering an incentive.<p>This is similar to how Congress sets the national drinking age. They can't tell states what the drinking age should be, so instead they tell the states that they can only get federal transportation funds if they maintain a drinking age of 21 or older.

They might as well have everything implemented in hardware.<p>The concern is that Apple and Microsoft are retaining a monopoly on the ability to install new software on your machine. They can install new software (or give you permission to), but no one else can. It's not that much of a problem if something isn't extensible at all; it's the drastic imbalance of power, in which they hold all of the cards, that is the problem<p>Android is much better, but it's still not perfect. It's based on Java and Google's own APIs, which they fully control. Google controls the play store, and many carriers sell locked phones that prevent you from installing your own software outside of the play store, as well as limiting what software you can install from there.<p>So, Mozilla does support Android, by releasing their browser on it. But they also believe that they can do better; create something that's more open, more hackable, more accessible than Android. Can they? I'm not sure. There are lots of frustrating things about the Web platform as well, I don't know if it's going to be better than Android's Java based platform. And Mozilla doesn't have the same resources as Google, so may not be able to deliver Nexus-style phones and tablets.

It's clear that it just doesn't support modularity properly, and there are severe consequences to this.<p>Yet there have still been those JavaScript developers who insist that it's a good language to use for anything beyond small (that is, a few lines of code) scripts. They go right ahead creating large amounts of extremely unmaintainable code.<p>I don't think the solution is to extend JavaScript. Realistically, the only sensible thing to do is to discard JavaScript for anything serious. Sure, maybe the language being used instead will compile down to JavaScript and try to fake properly modularity support, for instance, but this should only be a temporary measure.<p>All I think it would take is for a major player, like Google or Mozilla, to embed a more capable programming language in their browser. Python, for instance. It's has decent support for modularity, and has been proven with very large systems, yet it still offers the benefits of a scripting language.<p>The situation wouldn't improve over night, but after a few years we'd likely see Python support in the other major browsers, even if it's just the open source ones, and Opera. These days, that'd likely be enough to gain some good traction. Then we'd at least have a viable option for large-scale, client-side scripts within the browser.

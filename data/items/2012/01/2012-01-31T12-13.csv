But the move to categorize, contextualise and present real time content and provide it for third partners is a big businessmodel.

3532972,comment,3531285,3532890,8,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"There are different ways to provide universal health care. Canada, for example, has a single-payer system in which most medical practices are private but they bill the public insurer.<p>The system isn't perfect, obviously, but it is quite efficient at allocating money to actual health care rather than administrative overhead. Whole categories of business expenses (including, ahem, profits) just go away.<p>On the other hand, Britain has a fully nationalized system in which doctors are public employees, and their system is even more efficient than the Canadian system. In fact, across OECD countries, the overall efficiency of the health care system seems to be positively correlated with the extent to which the government directly controls it.<p>In the US, the public parts of the health care system are overall much more efficient at allocating resources to care than the private parts.<p>Sidenote: I will pause here to draw a distinction between <i>allocative efficiency</i>, or the extent to which a system allocates capital where it will maximize ROI, and what we might call <i>outcome efficiency</i>, or the extent to which a system allocates resources where they will maximize effectiveness.<p>Market based systems are better at allocative efficiency, but the evidence is that they are much worse at outcome efficiency. Market-based health care is great business, but it leaves far too many people under- and uninsured.

My concern is that by having so many battery & other options, Tesla is probably requiring different manufacturing processes, different equipment, which can dramatically affect costs (esp. fixed costs). To put it more simply, if you offered only 1 option, you manufacture at scale and can easily bring down unit costs. However, if you are offering, say 3 options that means you split your scale by 1/3 and its harder to bring unit costs.<p>This wouldn't be an issue if the parts being built were commodity items but I assume a lot of the parts for Tesla are quite customized / niche. To put it another way, I remember reading that for some American manufacturers it was actually more costly to produce manual cars since demand is so low in the US and assembling them would require a separate line which would reduce efficiency.<p>However I really don't know anything about manufacturing cars.

Think. Probably Square will get a big consumer-face for its mobile payments company where every user of Twitter is able to exchange/collect/sell/charge anyone (friends) for petty purchases. And Twitter will get a business model.<p>Using a nicely integrated web-to-mobile-to-anything system, Twitter can empower people to use their twitter accounts to not only converse, but also share money with each other. Just like we do in college.<p>That's much more value than serving like a news hose. How does this sound to you?",1328013034

3532961,comment,3530107,3532067,19,0,michaelochurch,,,"It was me who wrote that. My observation of Google is that, while it's not as blandly bureaucratic as a typical big company, and there isn't the mean-spirited greed of investment banks, the place is extremely <i>careerist</i>. People are laser-focused on the promotion process and the political campaigning it entails, because the ranks really matter, and not just in terms of compensation, but how much respect you get within the organization and how much say you have in what you work on. You aren't a Real Googler until a certain point on the promotion ladder, and the Real Googler Line keeps rising: it used to be Senior, but it's shifting over to Staff (the level above Senior). You can be a Real Googler at Senior, but only if you have it ""locked in"" be Staff in a year or two. If there's a sense that you may have plateaued at Senior, you're not a Real Googler.<p><i>I can't imagine how this works well in conjunction with the ""choose your own team and product"" ethos</i><p>Yeah, that's not true anymore. Google has a lot of icky maintenance work that has to be delegated somehow. Not only do you not get to choose your project for the first 18 months, but you don't know what it is coming in the door. This is one area where Google plays the diva card hard: you have to accept the job without knowing your project. You might get something interesting. You might not. More likely, it's the latter.<p>You can transfer after 18 months, but there's also a ""permission paradox"" effect; if you haven't worked on good projects, you have a really hard time moving to a good project because you're competing (for transfers) against people who've worked on more exciting and more visible stuff than you have.<p>A couple other marketing pitches that don't hold up: 20% time is dead. People get fucked over in ""Perf"" if they're perceived as actually caring about a 20%-time project. Finally, Google markets itself as a ""C++, Java, and Python shop"" when Python is pretty close to deprecated in production so it's mostly C++ (yes, C++; I am absolutely not making this shit up) and Java. Python gets a lot of use by managers who still want to code and need a real language because they can only commit 1/3 of their time to software, but almost all of the important projects get rewritten in C++.<p>The other thing I'd say about Google is that the company is extremely good at collecting talent (they have it down to a science, and their recruiters are some of the best in the business) and very bad at managing it, as you alluded. There used to be a morale-destroying process called ""slotting"": you'd start out at a ""mezzanine"" between two levels on the engineer ladder. You'd be given a job offer (and paid) as an N+1 but actually be ""between levels"" and you'd have about a 70% chance of dropping to N when you were slotted a year later. (Some people got double-downslotted, which was the kiss of death.) The result was a system that pissed everyone off. If you worked hard, beat the odds, and got upslotted, you didn't get a bonus-- you just got the job title you were promised. If you were downslotted, you now had a crappy job title compared to what you were promised in your job offer letter, and you wouldn't get raises for a long time on account of being ""overpaid"" for your level. It was a morale disaster, and thankfully they got rid of that idiocy, but a process like that makes you wonder how such an obviously shitty idea got in the door in the first place.<p>Career progress at Google is also ungodly slow. The promo rate is something like 10-20%/year (i.e. each ""level"" represents about 5-10 years of average-case work). The slow progress actually makes sense when you look at what Google is. Most of the work is legacy maintenance in C++, so unless you kill the lottery and get the best projects, you're likely to end up on things where you don't learn much and don't really <i>deserve</i> faster promotions.",1328012977

I've recently started using Flask for new projects in favor of Django. I feel that most of the libraries I use are framework agnostic, stuff like ORM (SqlAlchemy), PDF generation, redis/mongodb adapters etc, so being able to pick what fits and leave the cruft out is great.<p>But besides that, I feel that in recent times development is moving much more to the client - and client code like Javascript/CoffeeScript, Java for Android and Objective C, is getting much bigger at the expense of server side code. This is recently evidenced by the new 37signals Basecamp Next app which is 50/50 CoffeeScript/Ruby.<p>So the server side programming is on track to becoming ""just"" a API endpoint for all these different technologies and I think micro frameworks like Flask and Padrino are very well suited for that.",1328012842

If there's no formal agreement, the existing license has authority, and it's perfectly reasonable for the SFC to require adherence to the licenses of other packages used as a condition of re-licensing BusyBox to the infringing party.",1328011757

If not, then there's your answer: academically useful proof assistants cannot deal with real world data.

3532881,comment,3532669,3532669,2,0,assistme,,,"Several years ago I was looking for a Buyer for a domain I owned, for which I was confident I could sell for $35.000. So I looked for potential Buyers by consulting several trademark databases that contained registered trademarks similar to my domain name. While I found several potential leads, there was one in particular I knew would be keenly interested in my domain. And, while I relayed my asking price, and while the Buyer was eager to purchase my domain, their budget for such acquisitions was capped at $20.000. So, being unable to find another Buyer at the price I was asking, I sold it for the $20.000 that was on offer.<p>So, the moral of the story is this:<p>(1) Know the value of your product;
(2) Be able to defend your price point;
(3) Find competing Buyers;
(4) Know when to let go.<p>Good luck!",1328011250

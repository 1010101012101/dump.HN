10735831,comment,10714517,10714517,0,0,BenoitEssiambre,,,"IMO something like this is the future of AI. I&#x27;ve been trying to crack it for a while as a hobby. I also use vision tasks as test but unfortunately my algorithms get stuck in local maximums or coarse representation of images.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this paper&#x27;s algorithm is that powerful either. It seem to start with a squiggly line grammar that is already close the the final written text-like characters it is trying to learn. This narrows the model space very much and makes the problem easier.<p>It would be more impressive if it started with an SVG like grammar and learned to draw any kind of image. This is the approach I try to take anyways even if I can&#x27;t seem to get very far.<p>The problem is that the search space is so large and so irregular with regards to output that you can&#x27;t brute force it. You need to somehow cluster similar generative rules of different complexity together then get your algorithm to search the model space in a way that it tries simpler rules first, then goes on to try generating more complex rules but prioritize the ones that are known to have similar output to the simpler ones.<p>Basically you have to cluster your generative rules into an taxonomy that your algorithm can navigate from the top. It&#x27;s exponentially inefficient to try to generate &quot;dog&quot; until you have recognized that the simpler &quot;animal&quot; is a good approximation.<p>I also think that in the ultimate solution, the output leaf statements of the grammar will be parametrized like a normal programming language, so that for example, the algorithm can generate a color, a radius and then generate 100 circles referencing this single color and radius to represent repeated patterns without having to learn their size and color individually when they are clearly homogeneous or invariant across a bunch. The bayesian, occam&#x27;s razor, solution to a bunch of similar things that you don&#x27;t have a category for yet is shared parameters. These parameters is how you learn with very few examples. You don&#x27;t have to learn a full new category to make good predictions, the algorithm can simply notice the homogeneity in a part of a scene and extrapolate immediately.",1450151850

There are people who are poor and disenfranchised, and mentally ill, who feel that it gives them some power to saunter out into traffic and make everybody stop.  With an autonomous car, that deranged person can just sit down in front of the car, bringing everything to a halt.  Take New York as another example.  For years I only walked in NYC and I figured that all drivers were maniacs.  Then I drove though Manhattan once and I realized the actual dynamic.  If a driver doesn&#x27;t put on a credible appearance of being willing to run down pedestrians, the pedestrians will never stop crossing the street.  How does an autonomous car fit into that?<p>I think these cars are going to work brilliantly in very polite and orderly places like Zurich, where everybody takes their turn and neither pedestrians nor bicyclists nor drivers feel put upon by the system.

Software does not need to suffer from either and plenty of &#x27;old&#x27; tools are still in maintenance. Kernels, compilers, file-systems and network stacks originally written decades ago are still in common use today. Flex and Bison are still being maintained and still have major releases. Whether they are still &#x27;state of the art&#x27; is another question entirely but they&#x27;re definitely being used and they are more than ok for quite a few jobs.",1450148631

Autism is only really a very recent diagnosis, and reporting rates were either low or the condition wasn&#x27;t diagnosed properly.<p>Then the author hypothesises that the seratonin levels might be what causes the issues with autism. But those taking SSRIs have a problem with seratonin levels already, right? So how do they know it&#x27;s the anti-depressant?<p>I read the comments when study was posted to HN previously, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be too much questioning of the the study itself. Perhaps I&#x27;m being unfair.<p>This study has been criticised - I think NOR gives a pretty balanced report here:<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/12/14/459665937/a-new-study-raises-old-questions-about-antidepressants-and-autism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/12/14/45966593...</a>",1450148467

It was an obviously bad long-term idea, which makes me wonder if they think of this product as a business they plan to be in for the long term or if this is just something they&#x27;re toying with and trying to squeeze a few more bucks out of before they abandon it.<p>The most basic feature of a &quot;General Lighting&quot; product, besides providing light, is interoperability.  They have an opportunity to push general lighting into the next generation and reap the benefits of the long-term experience they have with the early-adopter market.<p>Instead, they&#x27;ve decided to put their product into the category of &quot;Novelty Lighting&quot;.  Meanwhile, should a competitor come along offering an open solution (there&#x27;s probably one already?) that gains traction, Philips will lose, and they&#x27;ll probably dump the product line well before they&#x27;ve lost, fulfilling the only guarantee a lock-in can fulfill: obsolescence.<p>And even if they walk this back, the damage is done.  They&#x27;ve shown they are willing to break customer&#x27;s existing installations via a software update and will do so without more than an FAQ to explain it.  They basically pushed a software update with the result of turning the lights off on their customers.<p>It&#x27;s disappointing more than anything.  Someone out there will do better.",1450148439

9162861,comment,9161777,9161777,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Here&#x27;s how to understand academia.<p>When you&#x27;re 22, almost everything you&#x27;ve done has been measured in relative terms to your peers (in part, because almost no one at that age has real accomplishments by adult standards, except in athletics; so it&#x27;s a favorable curve). You think that the world is more competitive than it actually is, because you&#x27;ve been rewarded (or punished) based on individual performance. Of course, people who are academically strong tend to be socially weak when younger. Academia appeals because you&#x27;re not around the &quot;jocks&quot; with superior social skills. Let&#x27;s be honest: most people who go into academia do so because they&#x27;re afraid that if they go into the big, bad business world, they&#x27;ll be out-shouldered by &quot;asshole jocks&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the trap. The real world is a lot more cooperative than competitive. If you&#x27;re a social &quot;4&quot;, you do better being the weakling in a crowd of 7&#x27;s (business)-- you&#x27;ll rise up to that level, from exposure, in a couple of years-- than the relative leader in an ivory tower full of 2&#x27;s. Why? Because social skills <i>aren&#x27;t about competition</i>; you want to be around skilled people who have your back. Those &quot;jocks&quot; don&#x27;t out-shoulder you, because adulthood isn&#x27;t middle school: they teach you how to get what you want. If anything, the worst bullies in adulthood are the ex-nerds who have something to prove.<p>Then there are the tribal effects. Why do bankers and traders earn 3x what programmers do, and why do we as programmers earn 3x what academics do, at each level? Because the worst place you want to be in a market is side-by-side with someone who&#x27;s similarly competent in the rendered service but has no organizational or social skill, nor sense of self-worth; he&#x27;ll sell himself very short, and drag you down with him by lowering your market value as well.<p>Academia&#x27;s appeal is that it&#x27;s some sort of safe haven for the socially awkward beings that smart people usually are in their early 20s (and usually grow out of by age 25-30). However, because it&#x27;s full of socially inept people who are terrible at making a case for their own value, the resource pool declines over time, and we&#x27;re now at the point where the academic job market is kaputt. There are a few star professors who manage to work their way out of the hell that is academia for the bottom 99+ percent, but the irony is that to do that requires a great deal of social ability anyway.<p>Academia&#x27;s promise is that you don&#x27;t need to be socially skilled and you&#x27;ll keep being rewarded for being smart. First, that&#x27;s a stupid promise in the first place. Those skills aren&#x27;t hard to learn (unless you have a hard neurological deficit, but that covers maybe 1% of the population) and you just need to grow up. Second, in the cutthroat environment you get amid dwindling resources and social investment in academia, it turns out that you need those skills to survive, making a joke of that promise.",1425757610

It doesn&#x27;t have to be web applications, it can be a book focused on building desktop or mobile applications. I&#x27;m more interested in the patterns the follow, as well as what and how they focus on testing.<p>I&#x27;ve found TDD pretty much impossible when you&#x27;re building a user interface. Even when I test my components (recently using react, prior to that using angular), it&#x27;s hard to know <i>what</i> I should be testing for. Testing the component&#x27;s logic is a given, and usually very straightforward. But how in depth should my DOM structure validation be? Should I check that certain classes and IDs are set correctly and leave it at that? Should I verify the DOM structure of the component? I&#x27;ve found this extremely difficult because you&#x27;ll often find yourself adding or removing classes to restyle components, or you&#x27;ll find yourself rewriting the HTML to fit better with a redesign of some sort.<p>Along this same line, what about e2e tests? I test core user interactions (e.g. user can create foo) with e2e tests, and edge-cases with unit tests. These tests will be clicking around and sending keys to inputs and eventually reach some state that confirms that the action was successful. Among all the states that were traversed, how many things will you validate (e.g. check that the link the user clicks is in a list, check that in the final state he can view all of foo&#x27;s information)? And how in depth? (e.g. checking that #foo contains all of foo&#x27;s information, or checking that #foo contains .bar, .baz, .qux, and that each contains part of foo&#x27;s information)<p>I&#x27;ve figured out some patterns and guidelines over time, but some of these tests tend to feel brittle or useless.",1425757300

Things were slightly easier for me as I was not only making pilgrimage but also visiting a friend of mine who was a novice at Iveron (and has since become a priest-monk). Going to Mt. Athos, while an incredible experience, requires quite a bit of preparation: not only should you be familiar with Orthodox monastic and liturgical life, you probably will also either want to know Greek yourself or have someone with you who is fairly fluent in Greek. As such, a better starting point to exploring monasteries is to find one close to you where the monks actually speak your native language. :)<p>To get a taste of Athos you can watch this short documentary online, where the monks gave unprecedented access to the tv news show 60 Minutes: <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mt-athos-a-visit-to-the-holy-mountain/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mt-athos-a-visit-to-the-holy-mou...</a><p>I should add that the book I previously mentioned, &quot;The Mountain of Silence,&quot; provides a very approachable introduction to Orthodox monastic life (which is really the Orthodox Christian life lived in a particular mode), without requiring any religious background. The author himself is writing from the perspective of an anthropologist, although I think at the time he was also a lapsed Orthodox Christian. Suffice to say that a relatively non-religious friend of mine really enjoyed the book. :)<p>All that being said, more info on visiting Mt. Athos is here: <a href=""http://www.athosfriends.org/PilgrimsGuide/planning/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.athosfriends.org/PilgrimsGuide/planning/</a> I should note that Athos does not allow women visitors, but there are similar monastic communities for women. This is not at all intended to be sexist, but is part of the asceticism of Athonite monasticism in particular. Previously women have settled on Athos, and the monks simply let them live there -- they ended up leaving of their own accord. Also, the monks sheltered families of Jews during WW2, which of course included women.<p>Edit: I forgot to respond to your question about joining.

Face recognition has always been popular; Facebook, Google, etc have their methods and whatnot, the momentum hasn&#x27;t really changed much there. However, now that biometrics are making their way into more consumer applications I am starting to see more spoofing, liveness tests, and key binding type papers making more of a presence.  In my opinion, this is fantastic.<p>A major gripe that i have with the biometric field is that it feels very &#x27;applied&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;theoretical&#x27;. Let me be clear first, biometrics is an interesting combination of computer vision, machine learning, raw signal/image processing, and matching. Since many pattern recognition/ML researchers rarely read biometric publications (conferences like ICB, IJCB, BTAS, etc. or journals like IEEE TIFS), any good theory that&#x27;s developed is largely ignored unless the researchers go to places like CVPR or TPAMI (which is very difficult due to a wide array of topics, instead of a smaller more explicit focus).  This unfortunately leads to a lack of  motivation to focus primarily on theory, instead borrowing what is working in other fields and applying them to our problem.  Not a bad thing in any sense of the word, that&#x27;s what research is - exploring the space of possible solutions. However, it becomes a one way street. We keep looking out, but no one else is looking in.<p>Now back to spoofing, liveness tests, etc. With deep learning, industry has a new spark for ML research. Adding more consumer biometric tech (that aren&#x27;t developed by Honeywell et al.)  means those ML researchers may start looking at journals like TIFS to find engineering suggestions to secure or integrate their systems (e.g. liveness tests). Hopefully a few papers will also catch their interest in the process and maybe...just maybe start to bring more attention to the more focused publications in the field. As the cream rises, we may just see more theoretical results instead stuff of LBP + X method.",1425756815

This is the evolution of a previous similar side project I developed for Android. The version for Android was appreciated beyond my expectations and this motivated me to develop the project further. Having already sold some thousand units on Android based on contents purely developed by me I thought I could do better with a more sofisticated app based on contents provided by real chess trainers. 
I managed to find one FM and one IM willing to colloborate and started to work on the iPhone version. I rewrote the app from scratch and launched a MVP with three volumes written by the two authors mentioned above. I expected to sell at least three times than the Android version.
Nothing was further from truth: results have been extremely dissapointing. The app has been downloaded about 700 times and I sold 5 volumes in total.<p>Feedback that I got from users and beta-testers is generally positive as can be seen here:<p>http://goo.gl/pBMML8<p>however this appreciation does not convert into downloads. 
The application is based on a portable c++ core ( almost 85% of the code, the rest being objective-c ) and could be easily ported to other mobile and desktop platforms.<p>Is there anyone that could be interested in joining forces to develop the project further? 
I would appreciate very much also any kind of feedback on the project including criticisms.
I am at a turning point and would like to understand If it is worth to spend further effort on the project or if it would be better to let it go.",1425756778

But it feels like in many ways, the effort has died.<p>Machine translation is still very much an active area of research. It sucked for many years as people hand-crafted more and more complicated systems; the big breakthroughs of the past ten years or so have come from realizing that, given very large (internet-scale) training datasets, you can apply some simple statistical methods and do much better than the previous hard-coded methods that couldn&#x27;t exploit this wealth of data. There&#x27;s been lots of tuning of the shallow statistical approach, but my understanding is that significant further progress will involve models that capture a deeper understanding of semantics while still maintaining the ability to be trained from large datasets. Identifying such models is hard and is an active area of research. Neural networks have been receiving a lot of study recently as one possible approach (see e.g. this demo <a href=""http://104.131.78.120/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://104.131.78.120/</a> from Yoshua Bengio&#x27;s lab), but there are other avenues as well.<p>Basically I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to say &quot;the effort has died&quot;. Research takes time, the technology is improving, and it&#x27;s quite possible that within another ten or fifteen years we&#x27;ll be able do to the sort of seamless, accurate translation across the Internet that you&#x27;d like to see. (translation between European languages, which are fundamentally similar in many ways, is already close to that point, but bridging the gap to Asian languages has been much harder...)",1425755296

Extremely time consuming and with no obvious market for the information relative to the time of &quot;collecting information on 900 different cards&quot;.

If I am going to give an address at the MIT computer center, I dress with a bolo and an old corduroy jacket or something else. I know enough not to let my clothes, my appearance, my manners get in the way of what I care about. An enormous number of scientists feel they must assert their ego and do their thing their way. They have got to be able to do this, that, or the other thing, and they pay a steady price.<p>John Tukey almost always dressed very casually. He would go into an important office and it would take a long time before the other fellow realized that this is a first-class man and he had better listen. For a long time John has had to overcome this kind of hostility. It&#x27;s wasted effort! I didn&#x27;t say you should conform; I said ``The appearance of conforming gets you a long way.&#x27;&#x27; If you chose to assert your ego in any number of ways, ``I am going to do it my way,&#x27;&#x27; you pay a small steady price throughout the whole of your professional career.

9162702,comment,9162176,9162352,0,0,stavrogin,,,"Hannah Arendt is widely praised and its Jerusalem book is often quoted all around the world, yet this portrayal of a &quot;mailman&quot; is more than dubious. The historian Hermann Langbein, who survived Auschwitz and later wrote the authoritative &quot;Men and women at Auschwitz&quot;, showed that her ideas didn&#x27;t match the facts. Recently, the first integral study of Eichmann&#x27;s papers completely broke this &quot;mailman&quot; picture: he was a typical intellectual, who read philosophy books and even poetry, and liked writing. This &quot;personality of a mailman&quot; is a nonsense, unless writing long commentaries of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy is &quot;banal&quot; for any &quot;mailman&quot;.<p>Taking the Nazis as a whole is another big mistake. Some were sorry, some tried to mitigate the violence, at different levels. Primo Levi (also very critical of Arendt) remembered a young woman that became a guardian: at first she was horrified, she couldn&#x27;t stand the violence and felt ill the first days, she tried to resign. A few weeks later, she was accustomed and hit prisoners. It&#x27;s a pity his &quot;grey zone&quot; concept is despised by our Manichean world.<p>Apart from this, I totally agree with the denial aspect. The Standford experiment was very probably a trauma for this former guard, and his denegating discourse seems strongly biased by this. His main claims are:<p>- This experiment is a fraud, it claims to prove that we, the guards, became &quot;evil&quot; (his term), but that&#x27;s wrong.
- The experiment was biased because the main experimenter made some important decisions along the way.
- We, the guards, did not loose our humanity, the material settings were inhumane and made us behave like this. For instance, we were sleep deprived.
- If a guard became violent, it&#x27;s not because he was violent, it&#x27;s because he was an amateur actor that had endorsed a violent role just for fun.
- The experiment author manipulated the students into saying things they didn&#x27;t thought, and he kept their identities secret to give him &quot;more control of the narrative&quot;.<p>Sure, this experiment is morally questionable and it&#x27;s hard to build strong conclusions upon it, but if it was a fraud, why wasn&#x27;t it debunked long ago? Why didn&#x27;t most of the students protest they were wronged? Why caricature it with notions of good/evil? And would actors play a &quot;violent cop&quot; role for many days just on an impulse, with graduating violence? And, most of all: if an inhumane setting made them behave with less empathy, less humanity, isn&#x27;t that a very interesting experimental result?",1425755017

As long as they don&#x27;t do anything in their response that assumes that the client has 1.1 features, all is fine.  This basically just means:
  * Don&#x27;t use chunked encoding in the response.  (Technically a 1.0 client could specifically indicate support for that by sending a &quot;TE: chunked&quot; header, but since chunked encoding arrived at the same time as 1.1 I think most servers just assume that HTTP/1.0 clients never support it)
  * Don&#x27;t assume that the client supports keep-alive connections.  However, prior to HTTP/1.0 clients often did indicate that they could do keep-alive by sending &quot;Connection: keep-alive&quot;.  The only real difference in 1.1 is that now the client must support it unless they specifically indicate that they don&#x27;t by sending &quot;Connection: close&quot;.

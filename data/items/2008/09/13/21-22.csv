Blu-Ray BD+ <i>doesn't</i> inconvenience most Blu-Ray customers (almost none of whom ""back up"" their DVDs).<p>That's a big part of why they work.<p>The trouble I think most people have in analyzing DRM is that it's not an all-or-nothing problem; it's an economic one. There will always be cammed copies of first-run movies for sale on the street and circulating on BitTorrent. But as long as it's easier to buy than to copy --- at least in the first 2 weeks of a release --- DRM is working. To achieve that, DRM vendors just need to make the cost of a break more expensive than those first couple weeks are worth in piracy costs.<p>I don't really have a horse in this race. I'm not sold on DRM either. I've worked professionally on both sides of this problem. What I think right now is that CS types are underestimating the next generation of DRM systems. Software and content protection is getting more sophisticated. It also dovetails more effectively with systems security than it did 10 years ago. We want locks on our platforms so they don't get enrolled in botnets; those same locks will help content providers enforce contracts.",1221342546

Do you think it will ever be difficult to (find and) download an unprotected Top 40 single from the Internet? An HDTV rip of a television show? Will the ""DRM ecosystem"" be able to secure popular content in the future, thereby having a significantly detrimental effect on piracy? Is the security of BD+ the beginning of a trend in next-generation content protection, or an anomaly?<p>What I'm really trying to puzzle out is whether DRM prevents, or will prevent in the future, enough piracy (and convinces pirates to purchase?

Customer utility (for a subset of customers) is higher for search results presented in the style of Sourcetool than in the style of Google. (i.e. Google isn't all things to all men - no shame in that).<p>B. Those customers do not know about Sourcetool, but do know about Google. (market inefficiency = imperfect knowledge)<p>So assuming this customer ultimately wants sourcetool style results, there are three steps to be taken:<p>0. Customers goes to www.google.com<p>1. Google refers them to Sourcetool<p>2. Source tool provides the desired services (even if that includes serving an ad)<p>In this scenario, both Google and Sourcetool should capture the value associated with giving the customer what they want - they both played a part.<p>I dont know if both parties <i>are</i> capturing value, but its certainly true that they both <i>could</i>. Google gets paid by the advertiser who places the ad served by AdSense, so even if Google's two transactions with Sourcetool are net negative, Google may well be coming out net positive with the inclusion of the transaction of the AdSense advertiser.<p>Seems to me that Google should merely be setting is rev-sharing terms with Sourcetool to ensure that both parties capture value.<p>tom saffell",1221340532

It's no big deal.<p>However, round table discussions it becomes painfully apparent the team all supported the same reason for backing out as I did: we didn't like their blog.<p>I had everyone go to the site, try to get a feel for this other company.  Look at their porfolio, and try to get a feel for the type of clients this partner works with.  Everyone came back and said the blog just didn't feel authentic.  It felt like they were trying to be niche bloggers and didn't actually try to communicate with people.  It was stale.  Contrast this to the other huge firms here in town who blog about just about anything, you can see there's a real sense of character emanating from these places (which says a lot considering one of the other companies is made up of 4 guys and a dog, yet they produce absolutely the best design work in the city, the other has repeatedly been considered the best marketing company in the south east).<p>This got me to thinking about something that was already troubling me: there are plenty of companies in my community that are on the web, but use their blogs as glorified event calendars.  Their entire archives are repeats of ""Don't for get about this event, coming up on this date"".  There's hardly any company philosophy or jovial conversation to the readers going on.  It's wasting valuable space and it's impacting the market when you see things like this.<p>My question to YC: How does your team approach blogging?

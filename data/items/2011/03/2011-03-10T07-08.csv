And more so because its much easier to write rouge apps or malware-apps for smartphones than to hack the dedicated card readers. In case of a malware-app, the danger is not just limited to one merchant.
It seems to me that the real question raised by verifone is not being given enough concern.
Why can't the square card encrypt the CC data ?? with a private key that only square-app can make sense of?",1299743947

Insert the dongle into the audio jack of a smartphone or iPad, and you've got a mobile skimming device that fits in your pocket and that can be used to illegally collect personal and financial data from the magnetic stripe of a payment card. It's shockingly simple.<p>The issue is that Square's hardware is poorly constructed and lacks all ability to encrypt consumers' data, creating a window for criminals to turn the device into a skimming machine in a matter of minutes.</i><p>The ""problem"" is that the Square reader thing doesn't encrypt its communication to the iDevice.<p>And it shouldn't.  As Square said in the letter, by merely <i>seeing</i> your card someone has enough information to steal from you.  At best they could public-key encrypt the data in the reader itself and pipe the encrypted data to their servers... until someone cracks the key.  Or makes a fake Square reader that's identical to the ones out now.  At which point we're back at square one.  As it stands, Square just made a simpler version of a standard credit card reader, and for some reason they're claiming it's a security hole.<p>FWIW: Verifone just guaranteed I'll go out of my way to avoid ever being a customer of theirs.  This is FUD, plain and simple; they're probably doing it because they see a threat and are trying to squash it, rather than out-perform it.",1299743869

It's all about the issue of trust and habit.<p>Skimming equipment, both software and hardware, has been freely available for ages now. And it's quite simple. Anybody who knows how to use ebay and write a small application can create quite sophisticated skimming equipment themselves.<p>The problem is not the availability of the equipment or the know-how. The problem is what ""average Joe"" is used to. If ""average Joe"" would balk when presented an off the shelf mobile phone to swipe their card through, well, then skimming using a mobile phone would be hard. But if the banks and payment processors have trained ""average Joe"" to know that a mobile phone is a completely legit way of reading credit cards, well then this type of skimming is easy.<p>If no ATMs existed, well, then it would be really hard to skim cards using an ATM-like device, because people would balk.<p>It's all about keeping the different legit ways of accepting credit card payment to a minimum. The fewer legit ways, the fewer possibilities of skimming.<p>On the other hand, there is no doubt in my mind that mobile payment will be the future. Replacing the standard plastic will a chip in your mobile phone will become commonplace soon, and we will also probably see applications where you can transfer money to others simply by having both mobile phones interact.<p>So the question is if the big fuss really helps anyone, or if it's only delaying the inevitable.",1299743473

Sorry - it's a bit hard to keep track of discussions on HN because of a lack of notifications - so my reply has been a bit slow.<p>I agree completely that we need a more concrete understanding of how/why intimate behaviours are in fact under threat (if that is indeed the case).  The analysis of the first scene of the Social Network was there to give at least one example of how it is two people can actually be quite involved with one another and yet completely fail to establish an intimate connection.  But we need more.  It's impossible for me alone to provide that data.  I'm not even an empirical researcher.  But even more importantly - how could an empirical study be conducted?  That's a very difficult question.<p>I think what we need to start by people telling their stories of intimacy - or lack of it.  This might at least allow us to begin refining out intuitive understanding - which in turn might allow us to conduct more rigorous investigations.<p>I'm also pleased you enjoyed the ""paradox of modern intimacy"" section.

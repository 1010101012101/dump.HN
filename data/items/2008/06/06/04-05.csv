If they take your password and do nasty things with it, than it's a whole other story.<p><i>There isn't a banner above them which says, ""this feature is aimed only at people who don't understand the security implications.""</i><p>If you do understand the security implications, then the banner is irrelevant!<p>Also, they are not saying that you must use the feature either, are they? What happened to freewill? Does everyone think that you are supposed to consume every feature of the service just because it's free and it's there?<p>And to say they are ""teaching to compromise security"" is a gross dramatization. They are not teaching anything at all.",1212728320
210627,comment,210597,210626,0,0,avibryant,,,"Maglev is a persistent, distributed runtime - there's a virtual object space which is accessible from many VMs across many machines, and is transactionally persisted to disk.  So it's not so much that there's an incompatibility (you <i>could</i> use normal ActiveRecord from Maglev) as that it provides a better integrated alternative.  What's being discussed here is to what degree this integrated alternative should present an API compatible with ActiveRecord.",1212728285
210626,comment,210597,210597,0,0,alex_c,,,"I haven't followed Maglev closely beyond some of the links posted here, so the following confused me:<p><i>There were questions during the demo about ActiveRecord compatibility. To me, building in ActiveRecord compatibility is worse than a waste of time.</i><p>[...]<p><i>When you donâ€™t NEED an RDBMS (more often than you think) or you need scalable Ruby servers, I think Maglev is going to be an enticing alternative.</i><p>My understanding was that Maglev is an implementation of Ruby, while ActiveRecord is a feature of Rails... What am I missing?  Is there any fundamental incompatibility between Maglev and Ruby that would prevent ActiveRecord from ever working?  Why would it have to be ""built in""?<p>Edit: This link <a href=""http://www.avibryant.com/2008/06/maglev-recap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avibryant.com/2008/06/maglev-recap.html</a> from the other discussion thread gave me more information.  Still, if Maglev is Ruby (or Ruby+, maybe?) and ActiveRecord is written in Ruby, then bugs and minor incompatibilities aside, shouldn't ActiveRecord just work?",1212727906

""Steve is all about being on the team, and being committed to the mutual goals,"" Mr. Gates said. ""So I had to figure out, what are my behaviors that don't reinforce that? What is it about sarcasm in a meeting?"" he said. ""Or just going, 'This is completely screwed up'?""</i><p>His behavior is like that of a startup founder frustrated by working with the bureaucrats in the company that acquired his. Of course ""Steve is all about being on the team"". Most incompetent people are ""team players"", they hide behind committee decison making.",1212727744

210614,comment,210484,210535,0,0,mohamedsa,,,"I don't know of a readily available solution, but there are some discussion threads on comp.lang.lisp about ""tree shaking"" and how to could be used to remove unused parts of the runtime before writing the image. Some of those posts are quite interesting. And it seems some of those techniques are already implemented in commercial Lisp offerings.<p>For the time being, I think the way to go is to use Lisp for the cases that suit it best. My aim for using Lisp is for internal-use code generation or web stuff, so code size is not a big deal. Also if your program is already large and complex (which Lisp was designed for, being an AI language) then the initial runtime size wouldn't be too significant compared to the size of the program.",1212725031

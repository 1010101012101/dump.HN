3482033,comment,3475391,3476725,1,0,dalke,,,"I'm the author of that essay.<p>I mentioned in passing in a couple of locations that the code I describe is only an approximation to the code which I am actually optimizing. The fingerprint objects are bit patterns of (in this case) 2048 bits, and the similarity between two fingerprints is defined as the number of bits in the intersection divided by the number of bits in the union. (This is the ""Tanimoto"" or ""Jaccard"" similarity.) Simple math says that if the one fingerprint has B bits, and the threshold is t, then fingerprints to search must have between B<i>t and B/t bits.<p>What I do then to speed up the search is to precompute the popcounts for each fingerprint, sort them by popcount, and make an auxiliary index so I know where the start and end of each popcount count region is. As a consequence, this reduces the O(N</i>N) term by a factor of two. With that in place, my sort algorithm is closer to:<p><pre><code>    for (row=0; row<n; row++) {\n      query_popcount = popcount(fingerprint[row]);\n      start_popcount = num_bits*threshold;\n      end_popcount = num_bits/threshold+1;\n      for (target_popcount = start_popocount; target_popcount<end_popcount; target_popcount++) {\n        for (col = start_of_popcount[target_popcount]; col<start_of_popcount[target_popcount+1]; col++) {\n          num_bits_in_commmon = intersection_popcount(fingerprint[row], fingerprint[col]);\n          if (num_bits_in_common / double(query_popcount + target_popcount - num_bits_in_common > threshold) {\n            count++;\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\nThis is less comprehensible than the version I posted in the essay, but still has the essential problem I wanted to resolve.<p>With these optimizations in place, it's more complicated to determine the number of calculations which will be done in a row. For one, the popcount distribution is highly data dependent. I don't know that number until I'm in an inner loop, and so it isn't worthwhile to try and attempt to assign a ""constant amount of effort per Unit work.""<p>In the usual case of high thresholds, and if the fingerprint popcount distribution is broad, then I am mostly working along the near-diagonal of the matrix, which improves my cache coherency. However, if I have enough fingerprints then this simple linear scan will blow the cache, and the above needs to be replaced by some cache oblivious search pattern. If that's what you meant by ""2d shapes"" in your comment then perhaps you missed my mention of Morton Z-ordering?<p>My goal, however, was to explain the thinking needed to minimize lock contention and the difficulties in developing a parallel algorithm, so I used a simplified version of what I actually did to get that point across. Your comments deal with other aspects of the algorithm, and don't contribute to the point.<p>BTW, what do you mean by ""insane number of threads""? The target is a 8 core machine, and my timings numbers show a scaleup of about 6x for that case. I'm used to working on parallel molecular dynamics codes which use 10-100 processors, so this seems rather small.<p>Also, ""he can just keep a separate count per worker and then add it to the total when that worker finishes"" isn't correct, or rather, I can't see how to apply it to the symmetric form. The code I came up with has one single-threaded code, of O(N) time, and after the final barricade. I don't see how any other solution has less contention.",1326923975

So rather than buying less than 10%, there may in fact be no threshold at which pirating becomes more practical, once the initial monetary threshold (being able to afford the subscription fee) is met.<p>Therefore, copyright infringement <i>can</i> result in a much stronger loss in revenue than you presume, even though I personally agree that it doesn't constitute ""stealing"", as no physical good has been removed and appropriated illegally. However, what that copyright infringement <i>can</i> do is impede or obstruct certain consumer-favoring (IMO) business models from being viable.<p>It's possibly true, in my opinion, that sharing in a gray area of material whose market has not yet matured may increase visibility and have future benefits, but no company which deals with content producers and the platform to deliver content can afford to acknowledge this to the content producers or to the audience without risking legitimizing copyright infringement and therefore delegitimizing their own business (which is why I'm not disclaiming where I work, other than it is familiar with these issues).<p>Not that I'm arguing that there should be no such thing as sharing, but making the moral argument to justify it that stealing isn't putting the company in a worse position is a poor rationale. It's not true and it's not something that can be defended against in public.<p>Nor am I arguing that piracy will make or break a business. If it's big enough to be popular, it may be big enough to grow a legitimate market faster than the illegitimate alternative. However, this also relies on cooperative content producers and an audience willing to pay for the content. It's a tricky balance but the reality is that while violation of copyright may not produce economic devastation on its own, neither is it devoid of any impact.<p>tl;dr: Reasonable people should pay for content available to them that they enjoy, especially when affordable.",1326922983

3481938,comment,3477276,3481563,1,0,kls,,,"<i>I'd be curious as to a description of some of the specific revenue and cost saving advantages.</i><p>Sure no problem, the first and foremost that I can think of would be self contained widgets for third party sales channels. Lets say I sell hotel rooms. I can build a JavaScript widget that provides rates and inventory in a small list on the side of a page. A related sales site can then just drop it on their site, by adding a div with a certain CSS class assigned to it and it instantly giving me a direct sales channel where there was none. At little to no integration cost to them. So with that widget, I can implement a pretty robust affiliate sales channel. I could do the same with a static image or HTML as advertisement, but having real inventory and prices available is going drive up conversion. Thus it could be said to be a new channel of revenue.<p>Second would be in certain usage patterns, there are some usage patterns that when you have to submit a page back to the server for every step it becomes cumbersome and requires significantly more code. Lets take a grid for example, say I provide a list of items in a grid and I want that information to be sorted in one of several ways. With the old model of spitting it back to the server I have to hold on to a bunch of info on the server, and generate several views to re-sort it. With a JavaScript grid, I just have a couple of custom sort functions that I pass into the sort method on the array and then re-bind the results to my grid. So what would necessitate 5-6 different views generated by the server, I can manage with just a call to array.sort() the grid can observe the array.sort() and react to it being called. In these kind of multi-path UI workflows not round tripping to the server reduces a good deal of complexity from the system.<p>For me personally I think getting rid of SP (ASP, PHP, JSP) leads to a more maintainable system, because I think it is simpler. Having the UI and workflow concerns as a separate application that is delivered to the browser helps deal with a lot of Anti-patterns that the SP development model introduced. I prefer to write my front ends disconnected from the server and have their only connection be for data and business processing. I feel that it reduces the complexity of the solution and that it separates the concern of the workflow of a system from the processing of a system nicely. Some will differ on that and some will be more productive in the SP's. For me and the team I work with, we can deliver more compelling apps faster using JavaScript as our UI languadge. As well, I like the fact that the server architecture forces everything to be implemented behind addressable interfaces. It makes going to Mobile or other platforms as simple as creating a new work flow tailored for that specific device. JavaScript applications have evolved to take advantage of what the web is becoming. More and more people are implementing workflows never originally conceived of on top of unrelated back end systems. Taking services from Facebook, and Yelp or twitter etc. and implementing totally novel and new concepts, even if they are wholly unrelated to the companies that provide the services. This was not possible when UI's and data where locked, together, behind proprietary server technologies like the SP's. To me that is the greatest advantage, it provides a UI platform for an internet where all services are available as a collective platform. The entire web becomes the platform and anyone can write a workflow on-top of it.<p>As for useless features implemented in JavaScript I would say we had the same issue with Flash, just because you can does not make it the reason to do so. All I can speak for are the effort that I am part of and when we embark to build something we try to back it with real business need. Some people don't seems to put as much emphasis on not wasting time and money and I don't see that changing whether it is just a static web page, JavaScript or any other technology.",1326922516

Indeed, copyright (by its very nature) is aimed solely at benefiting whoever is in charge of distribution--it's about the right to copy.<p>As such, as technology attacks and removes middlemen, so too does it render obsolete the notion of copyright.

Moreover, I believe that it allows business models that would not be practical in a free market.<p>I don't think we need to do away with business--I just believe that if you create IP you need to accept (as a given!) that you won't be able to control its dissemination, and model your business accordingly.<p>If you can provide support for it in the wild, better then the other guy, it's a viable business (see Red Hat, Ardor Labs, etc.)<p>If you can provide faster access and better UX for it, it's a viable business (see Steam, Netflix, etc.)<p>If you can't do any of that, but can offer a sense of engagement with the community while polishing the software and get paid by donations/preorders, it's a viable business (see Minecraft, Overgrowth, etc.)<p>Otherwise, you are literally building an entire business on scarcity the government provides and enforces.

I had Age of Empires 3 which would not run on my machine, period, because it didn't recognize the CD Rom driver and, as Microsoft explained, it might be a 'virtual' CD ROM and that would violate the terms of service. And even though it wasn't and didn't I could never run their software on that machine.<p>Thus the who piracy economic argument is broken in three ways:<p>1) Folks who pirate software won't pay full price, sometimes they won't pay any price. So the economic 'loss' from piracy is either '0' or the area under the curve described by units pirated vs actual purchase price.<p>The loss is 0 if you use the reasoning that if there were perfect piracy prevention, none of these people would have paid for the retail version.<p>2) The cost of protection adds additional production costs (printing unique product code stickers and adding them) adding additional steps to boxing/shipping, adding additional activation software and its testing.<p>3) The additional cost of support when legitimate users like this guy call support to have a human you're paying anywhere between 10 and 25/hr to 'solve' this persons install/operation problems.<p>Folks who have done the math, with real numbers (and Lotus comes to mind), determine that they earn more money by not including DRM on the product. When Lotus first announced they were removing DRM from their 1-2-3 product they mentioned that nothing they had done had ever slowed down the availability of pirated versions but had added additional support burdens every time.",1326921055

I grew up in Denmark but have no intention of ever moving back permanently.<p>I don't know how long you've lived in Denmark, but perhaps you are familiar with ""Janteloven""? To someone who did not grow up in Scandinavia, it may just seem like another one of those cultural quirks that pops up from time to time. But, it is quite real and drilled into your head from the moment you're born. Some parts of the country are worse than others in this respect, but everyone succumbs to it at times. Many Danes make it a point to vigorously deny this.<p>Perhaps it's just because I grew up there, but I was overjoyed when I found out that my family was moving to the US. I definitely feel more at home here than anywhere else in the world.<p>With that said, I can absolutely understand why you, as an American, would like and probably prefer to live in Denmark. The people <i>are</i> friendly (mostly, there's always a grouch somewhere), it's a well-educated culture, and the social safety net is enviable. If you're okay with the tax rate and don't mind the weather, I would agree it's quite idyllic.<p>Also, the points you make about the US being a litigious society are well taken. The US is rightly made a laughing stock for people being able to sue McDonalds for making them fat. That's just ridiculous.<p>So I think it may just be that we value different things in life. I've met many American expats in Europe who would never want to go back, who feel, as I do, that where they are is their home. If we all are interested in making where we live a better place, that's probably the best we can do.",1326921035

And the quotation he opens with is downright stupid; no conspiracy or nefarious intent is needed to explain the phenomenon. As you say, it boils down to those basics.<p>One would expect that as prices rise, fewer people would attend college. However, as Americans wail that college costs are too high, the government attempts to ""help"" by subsidizing the costs through various means. But given the number of applicants, colleges still need to limit enrollment to their actual capacity, and the way to keep some people out is by raising prices, allowing those at the lower margin (in terms of their desire to attend) to drop out of the running.<p>But I think that the accounting for the benefits (and opportunity costs) of attending college is way more complex than just looking at differences in income. There is also a person's feeling of personal accomplishment or growth; the student's (or their parents) status; signalling of group membership; and so on.<p>And it seems that a college education is a product whose elasticity is very low. As a society, we've come to view it as such a significant marker for job ability and for social status that we've grown increasing convinced that it's a necessity, and thus colleges must raise prices even faster to keep the enrolled population (i.e., quantity demanded) manageable.",1326920757

A decent fraction of these comments cite Rupert Murdoch and/or phone hacking.<p>That's not very productive. Anyone on the pro-SOPA side can say exactly the same thing about e.g. Google. One of Google's major divisions, Youtube, was built in part on piracy. And Google itself does help people find pirated content; that's not something immoral, and they do make it difficult, but Google benefits from some copyright infringement in the sense that it means they're a better default search engine, since some fraction of queries are for copyright-violating content.<p>And the WSJ article does make a similar point:<p><i>Wikipedia has never blacked itself out before on any other political issue, nor have websites like Mozilla or the social news aggregator Reddit... They've taken no comparable action against, say, Chinese repression.</i><p>This is not the first thing so awful that websites choose to take such action--it's the first awful thing that <i>threatens them</i> so much.<p>The WSJ also points out that the most egregious part of SOPA--DNS-level censorship--was removed in the latest draft.  They don't make an exceptional argument, but they do make a superficially reasonable case; someone unfamiliar with the way the Internet works would likely find it pretty convincing.<p>SOPA/PIPA is an awful, awful idea. But if the WSJ claims that it's a good idea, and you claim that the WSJ only says so because corrupt, then you lose by default.

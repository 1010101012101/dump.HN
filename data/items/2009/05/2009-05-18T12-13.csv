614877,comment,614478,614478,0,0,jasongullickson,,,"I think what's missing here is that it can take a long time post-launch for your app (or any other product) to take off and this is where the independent developer with a day-job has the advantage over the VC (or otherwise funded) start-up with full-time employees.<p>If you have the means to support yourself, you can fine-tune your app and it's marketing over the course of years (as someone else mentioned, tuning internet marketing takes more ""calendar time"" than clock-time) and hone it until you get it right.  I know we all think time moves faster on the internet, but look at how much time elapsed between Twitter's first public beta and it's breach into the public eye (only a month or so ago?).<p>On the other hand, if you are working on your project full-time, you have a fuse burning that is your funding and generally it's limited.  From some of the conversations I've had recently, this fuse is as short as six months (and that's counting dev time before launch) and in my experience that's not enough, even if you get really lucky with media coverage.<p>I don't think there is a right or wrong answer here.  You have to continually evaluate your current position and decide if you need to go full-time to make it to the next level, and there is no prescription for this as every project (and developer) is different.  My only advice is that you put off making the jump as long as possible because when you do, you've given up one of the major advantages you have over companies that need to satisfy shareholders/employees and the cost is going to change the dynamics of your project dramatically.",1242651209

I had fallen in love with the city before even stepping foot in it - from blogs, travel articles, Chuck Palahniuk's excellent quirky guide/book to his hometown, stories from friends.<p>Portland is one of the friendliest vibes cities I can recall.   Walking through the Alberta arts district, you literally can walk into impromptu parties in strangers' backyards. I enjoy riding bicycles and Portland's bike culture isn't just bike culture - it's culture. There, it is disturbingly normal to not just ride a bike but a high-wheeled double bike contraption. The food scene is top-notch - I had one of my best Latin meals at Nuestra Cocina. There is live music playing every day of the week. The tech scene is crazy - lots of interesting people doing stuff (I even met the guy who does all of the BART web stuff - he doesn't live in SF, go figure)<p>I never made it to the Pearl District (the hip/trendy part of town and where I thought I'd rent). I did make it to the extraordinary Powells Book Store on the edge of the Pearl, but I felt more at home in Alberta and elsewhere.<p>The negatives I noticed. The job market (in May 2008) was such that I probably would only have a tech job if I could convince my current employer to let me work remote (which would have required an all-in type of negotiation - e.g. ask and if I didn't get it - go anyway otherwise credibility destroyed)<p>Agh the weather - it really does drizzle a lot there. And it's cold.<p>I can understand the draw of Portland. As an author once said, ""everyone in Portland has three lives."" They're a waitress, a mother, a watercolor artist. No matter how unique you feel you are, you'll feel at home in Portland - it allows people to live their multiple lives. Yes, you can do that anywhere but Portland is a catalyst.<p>I resisted it and am finding that you can make the best of where you currently are - from friends to being involved in your local tech community to volunteering to beyond.<p>high-wheeled double bike: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/ashleyblodgett/2442644672/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/ashleyblodgett/2442644672/</a>",1242650485

Simplicity. He ranted and raved about advertising that failed to pic a simple benefit and hammer it home, advertising that failed to motivate the reader to act.

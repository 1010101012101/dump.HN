If these guys can still be vulnerable then noone can be confident. When it comes to computer security we are for the most part working with very poor tools and even less understanding when it comes to building systems that are both tractable and secure.",1248573535

Had consensual sex at age 17 with your high school sweetheart^?  If you got caught doing either one you end up on the same list as the child molesters and rapists.  Lucky you.<p>And the sad thing is I don't see this changing anytime soon as any politician who tries to tackle this will be clobbered by his opponents for being lenient on those evil sex offenders.<p>^Given sexual trends among teens I'm guessing a ridiculous portion (I'd venture over 80%) of the people in America should be on the sex offenders list.",1248573421

His article is an excellent piece on user behavior research, and his results quite interesting, but it really bugs me that lots of articles now close with the words ""you should follow me on twitter here.""<p>You may ask why I get upset over this. The reason is that it sheds some light on the intentions of the writers. Seeing the call to action tells me ""this person will do anything to get followers."" I may be naive, but I would like people to follow me due to my interesting insights, and not because of some cognitive hack.<p>Articles that are otherwise inspiring then come crumbling to pieces once I get to the bottom of the page and see this blatant attempt at getting followers. In fact, it produces the opposite reaction in me, I quickly close the tab and forget the contents of the article or why I thought it was insightful in the first place.<p>I'd much rather see people trying other approaches, or even better, not try to persuade me with anything else than the content they produced. If what they're saying is insightful, I'll crave for more and will bookmark them, follow them, and tell my friends about it.<p>Dustin did a great job at finding this hack, and I expect to see ""follow me on twitter here"" at the end of his articles. He earned it. Everyone else, please find your own hacks.",1248572554

He is well known for having an extremely painful automated grading system for Comp Sci homework, but that does not work nearly so well for other course (e.g. higher math or essays). The article claims they have solved this by peer review, but I would be interested to hear how they are making that work.<p>One of the other problems is the questionable value of degrees and grades in the first place: we as a society need to start evaluating people/employees based on prior results, like internships.<p>So yeah, more online learning is a good thing, but I doubt we will have online universities truly overtaking four year brick and mortar universities any time soon.",1248571811

723911,comment,719275,723316,0,0,Scriptor,,,"<i>""In our brain, certain impulses are carried via electricity, so they are as fast as possible (inside their structure)""</i><p>No, electric impulses in your brain are not carried in the same way as electricity in wires. Please read up on basic neuroscience before you talk about the nervous system. Nerve signals are passed by having one section of a nerve be depolarized (lose polarity, the difference in charge from inside and outside the nerve wall), which causes the next section to depolarize, and so on. Your basic electric wire uses a difference in electric potential, or voltage, between one end and the other, which creates an electromagnetic field that moves electrons.<p>You completely misunderstood the importance of time. I'm not talking about long-term development (and even then your average human infant of even 6 months is far more intelligent than most animals on Earth). I meant the speed at which the nervous system works as compared to a computer. If you read my previous paragraph, you can see that a computer is still much faster than the human brain. The brain's advantage is the complex networking of all the neurons. Science has already gone a fair way in understanding the brain, we can even decipher signals to let paralyzed people control computers. How much longer until we can start modeling simple brains, and then further?<p>And as for my speculations, <i>look at what you're doing right now</i>. You, and I, can instantly communicate over a host of different ways even if we are on opposite sides of the Earth. If we wanted to talk face-to-face, we could even see digitized versions of each other in video chat. If we wanted to meet in person, it's only a matter of ours for one of us to go to the other. What do you think people from a hundred years ago would say when you told them such things would be possible?<p>It may take a while, dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of years, but your speculations of the uniqueness of nature are narrow-minded. You say that modern computers can <i>never</i> match nature because they use 1-dimensional data storage. I've already shown you how such storage can model 3d interactions (it's not about the data, it's about the way it's processed).<p>Maybe we should call it fiction for now, but remember that the very idea of having a machine calculate an integral, much less solve protein structures, would have been laughable in the past.",1248570729

723906,comment,723798,723896,0,0,sailormoon,,,"<i>""there's literally no good reason (besides laziness) to leave sshd exposed to the public internet.""</i><p>Well, besides the fact that it's a whole lot more convenient to just be able to ssh into somewhere without frigging around with VPN or what not. For most businesses, I would say having accessible ssh (with good passwords, and a properly set up, up-to-date system) is fine.<p>But yeah, for a ""security"" business .. it's pretty surprising they let it hang out like that.

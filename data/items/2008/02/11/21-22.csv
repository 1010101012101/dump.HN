I'm stuck on getting macports to work.<p>It's been three weeks since I tried installing Lisp, full time.  I've been trying to get it since about september, but as a noob, it's pretty hard.  There's a lot of stuff out there, but I just can't make it happen.<p>Weirdly enough, it took me a few hours to get emacs running on Windows.<p>Why does this take six months and thirty man pages instead of four seconds and two clicks?  Why does this take so much longer to download than rescuetime or firefox?",1202766830

He went home and threw bits of a tire in a microwave emitter he’d been working with for another project. It turned to what looked like ash, but a few hours later, he returned and found a black puddle on the floor of the unheated workshop. Somehow, he’d struck oil.<p>Their first order is under construction in Rockford, Illinois. It’s a $5.1-million microwave machine the size of small bus called the Hawk, bound for an auto-recycler in Long Island, New York.

The megalomania thing wears a bit thin, for example.  I know quite a few noobs that have been helped by his pragmatism (""just pick an implementation and stick with it,"" ""Stop bitching and do something""), but just as many that have left or put him in their killfile because of his off-center tangents and his occasional desire to be the new Erik.<p>You received a warm welcome because you contributed something useful and didn't just come in bitching and moaning.  You were also smart enough to figure out something you could contribute with your current skill level instead of just copping out.  Like Kenny, I admire that.  And I think Kenny is often very helpful and entertaining.  Like many /stereotypical/ geeks, though, I think his sense of humor and social skills are sometimes a bit off.

This can be the first step in the long path to a green card, which is worth a great deal of money.<p>The equation changes for US citizens and permanent residents, because the green card and/or legal right to reside in the US isn't part of the equation.  Residency + a 35K/yr post-doc is a lot more appealing if you don't already have the residency.<p>It would be interesting to see what would happen if foreign scholars were directly awarded a 10 year residency visa and a spot on the green card list upon arrival in the US, independent of whether they remained in the Ph.D program.  In other words, what would happen if the US said ""you're obviously smart enough to make the best use of your own life - welcome to America, and feel free to follow your own path in life.""<p>I wouldn't be surprised if the drop-out rate increased dramatically, since the foreign students would now be free to join startups or pursue other degree paths.",1202763833

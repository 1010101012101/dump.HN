Keep in mind what you&#x27;re proposing is that hundreds of semi-independent agencies have the ability to push this information directly into the aircraft FMC.<p>The other reason it&#x27;s communicated this way is because over an open audio channel other pilots can listen to the traffic and keep themselves apprised of situations in the local airspace and advise of conflicts with previous instructions.<p>Finally,  it leaves the choice in the hands of the pilot.  The controller may give incompatible instructions (runway not long enough for landing weight) or make impossible guidance requests (airspeed too low for landing configuration). The FMC is not a friendly computer system to use and it is highly integrated with most of the critical flight systems.  It most certainly isn&#x27;t perfect and pilots absolutely do not want anyone to be able to make changes to their flight data remotely.<p>> ...actually, isn&#x27;t this technology already available, so that ATC can give commands to planes flying on full autopilot?<p>Nope.

10609896,comment,10606507,10609151,0,0,polyfractal,,,"<i>> Some even say cholestrol is not bad</i><p>The main change recently has been an update to the ACC/AHA LDL guidelines about LDL targets.  Previously, there were hard targets that the doctor was trying to reach, in particular the 70mg/dl target was considered &quot;optimal&quot; and doctors strived to get their patients down to that.<p>In reality, it&#x27;s become clear that there is no clinical evidence that an LDL that low is required.  Certainly decreasing it from a high level (150+) has been shown to be a good idea (in most cases...it&#x27;s complicated).  But once you&#x27;ve decreased a patients LDL to a lower level, the clinical benefit of hitting 70 is nebulous.<p>So the new recommendations have dropped many of the hard targets, and recommend a more case-by-case evaluation.  E.g. if your patient has a high LDL and you put them on a statin, they start exercising, eating better, and levels come down to 80mg/dl ... well, that&#x27;s probably fine.  They are in good shape, monitor and back off the statins.<p>A major reason for the change is because you&#x27;d see people on statins and other cholesterol meds for <i>years</i>.  These drugs are very safe and low side-effect, and when combined with hard targets, doctors just &quot;leave&quot; patients on statins forever.  But despite being safe, you shouldn&#x27;t be on a chronic medication and there are other risks.  So the new guidelines are trying to encourage doctors to use statins more sparingly.<p>Some more reading on the new guidelines:<p>- <a href=""http://emorymedicinemagazine.emory.edu/issues/2014/spring/features/guidelines-for-treating-cholesterol/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emorymedicinemagazine.emory.edu/issues/2014/spring/fe...</a>\n- <a href=""http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/814152"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/814152</a>",1448195974

The update includes a new webinar feature which allows users to host public video conferences online, making communication beyond the enterprise network easy and secure.\nWebinars are aimed at external users who do not have an account on the company network and allows conference hosts to broadcast organizational news, lessons or other information to the general public. Unlike cloud services, a webinar administrator using TrueConf Server has a complete control over the infrastructure of the conference, offering maximum security for the event.\nThe guest page where attendees join the webinar is stored on the server and can be accessed online. The conference link can be set to a user-friendly URL when creating an event on the server, making it easy for guests to find and join the webinar. Once they follow the link, the user will see the event description, the entry form, and the unique link which allows them to join from any browser or mobile device. All they have to do is enter their username and click the &#x27;Enter as a Guest&#x27; button to join the conference.\nTrueConf Server can integrate any webinar with third party websites. When the event is created, the HTML code for embedding to a web page is generated in the Web Manager. Guests can access the webinar via an embedded link, which displays information on the event and a one-click guest entry form via WebRTC.\nAll webinar participants receive an e-invitation when the event is scheduled. Every invitation includes a file in .ics format to integrate the event with the calendar of their choice: Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar or Mozilla Thunderbird.",1448193904

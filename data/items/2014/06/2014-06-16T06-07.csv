And jq uses a copy-on-write, reference counted representation of JSON values, which is, for example, inherently thread-safe (though jq isn&#x27;t using atomic operations for refcount management yet).  The library is easy to use and powerful.<p>Ultimately the main thing I love about jq (and why I contribute to it) is the jq language itself.  It reminds me of my one-time favorite, Icon.

But the expression (a < b ? a : b) is not symmetric with NaNs. So what do we do?<p>We could assert that if only one value is an NaN, we return the other value. We might write it like this:<p><pre><code>    if (a != a) return b;\n    return a < b ? a : b;\n</code></pre>\nThis isn&#x27;t symmetric if both arguments are <i>different</i> NaNs, but in practice getting different NaNs takes some work.

Broadly, if you want to be sensible with your finances, <i>don&#x27;t buy a new car!</i> You&#x27;re essentially tearing up a whole lot of money the moment you drive it off the lot.<p>Late last year I did the numbers for myself (so again, sorry - no link!). I could run it through my company, so had the tax advantages of that when it comes to leasing. What I found was that the benefits only became clear when I compared leasing a new car with purchasing a new car. (iirc, Leasing with tax benefits was just a better option than purchasing with cash.)<p>And since I knew a new car wasn&#x27;t a good idea, leasing was shelved and I bought a second hand (pre loved?) vehicle. Those tax benefits (which would differ in different jurisdictions) may be one reason why it&#x27;s hard to find the site you&#x27;re looking for.<p>On the related topic of financing a car purchase, which I did with my first car many years ago, an obvious lesson I learned the hard way was combining weekly repayments with the length of the loan. All I had in my head at the time was &quot;$100 per week&quot; - of course, the dealer immediately applied this to a 5 year loan which almost lost me finance on my first home some years later.

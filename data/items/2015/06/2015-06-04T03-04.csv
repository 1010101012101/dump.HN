(where the control &quot;left&quot; does different things depending on where the character is facing)<p>They have gone back and forth on open world vs rails or corridors, and I find the open world, like FFXII, the most enjoyable and replayable of the titles.<p>When FFVII was released, it was one of the first my wife really wanted to play with me.  We played lots of games, but the vivid nature of the story, lots of activities, puzzles, mini-games (Oh, how we spent time on Chocobo breeding...), really made for an awesome experience!<p>But, an attempt to play it today is tough.  The really poor visuals often get in the way, and it just reeks of old.<p>This is true of many 2D titles too.<p>One difference is how abstract the game is.  An old 2D game, such as TEMPEST, or DEFENDER, actually looks and plays well today.  It is what it is, and that isn&#x27;t much, but the challenge is there, presentation sufficient, and it&#x27;s sort of timeless.<p>Those games that went for some realism, or that made more identifiable characters seem to age a lot more quickly, though somebody up thread mentioned SONIC.

Then later, Moped replaced its own BSON implementation with BSON-ruby, which had a version of the method which was not vulnerable. Later still, BSON-ruby&#x27;s method was changed, making it vulnerable. BSON-ruby is, AFAICT, the official BSON library for ruby from Mongo.<p>As I understand it, the vulnerability is in any ruby application which uses a vulnerable version of the bson gem and which accepts object IDs from user input.

One of the ways we fool ourselves into believing that we&#x27;re being rational, when we really aren&#x27;t.<p>Men are more likely to pipe up with ideas - good or bad - because they are culturally encouraged to do so. Women are discouraged from sharing their ideas, and are frequently either ignored, or possibly even punished for it.<p>In addition, people tend to interpret the same behavior differently between men and women. For example, I saw a debate recently with a few men and one woman. After the debate, people (both men and women) were complaining about the woman, claiming the kept interrupting, and that she was rude, and wasn&#x27;t listening.<p>Funny thing - she interrupted <i>once</i>, out of sheer desperation because her opponent wouldn&#x27;t allow her to speak, was polite, and listened to everything her opponent had to say. Her opponent, on the other hand, had been praised for being more mature and rational, despite constantly interrupting, talking over the top of his opponent, and being extremely condescending.<p>These kinds of biases actually color our perceptions, without us realizing.<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s insidious about these kinds of rationalzations. They superficially seem reasonable, but they pretty much just reduce to either &quot;men are just better than women at X&quot;, or &quot;that&#x27;s just the way things are, deal with it&quot;, and they do not hold up to scrutiny. However, they are intuitively rational-feeling enough to convince people that there&#x27;s not a problem anymore. There is, but they just don&#x27;t want to confront it.",1433387710

9657215,comment,9654710,9656860,0,0,BlackAura,,,"> not having the necessary information to make those biases could result in ideas actually being judged in a vacuum<p>Potentially, yes. It certainly can happen, but it can also go horribly wrong for a whole variety of reasons.<p>In online discussions, people&#x27;s ideas tend to be judged based on how well the person proposing them conforms to the norms of the group. Which is part of the reason most online communities tend to develop a kind of hive mind - everyone who sticks around shares the same opinions as the group, because the group chases off anyone who dissents, either by making the environment unwelcoming, or outright harassing people.<p>It&#x27;s part of the reason the hacker subculture isn&#x27;t as egalitarian as it likes to believe. Even if everyone&#x27;s anonymous (or at least using a pseudonym), it&#x27;s still composed almost entirely of nerdy, reasonably well off straight white guys, mostly from the US. The reason for that is a reflection of external social forces which don&#x27;t exactly exist inside hacker subculture, but strongly influenced who was able to participate in it. That creates an extremely homogenous group, which is reflected in the way hacker culture developed.<p>It&#x27;s not deliberate, but it can feel like a hostile environment to outsiders. Which can make outsiders avoid it like the plague. Since there are no outsiders, members of the group never hear their perspective, nor do they ever realize that there&#x27;s a problem, because they assume that they&#x27;re being egalitarian.<p>That&#x27;s not universal, and it&#x27;s much less common in groups that have <i>always</i> been diverse from the very beginning. If you have a group with significant numbers of women, for example, they will tend to object (much more loudly than in real life) when someone says something sexist. The group culture that develops tends to be one that does not tolerate sexism.<p>In that kind of environment, you tend to be able to have discussions where everyone is listened to, and their ideas judged on merit, for precisely the reasons you suggest. It&#x27;s all text based, and there&#x27;s no stimuli to re-enforce your biases that you carried with you from the outside world.<p>However, that can only be done if you don&#x27;t allow the group&#x27;s culture to become a reflection of the outside world&#x27;s culture. Which is what happens if you just ignore it.",1433386836

6433246,comment,6430191,6430613,5,0,jarrett,,,"> maybe third party doctrine is obsolete in a world where people voluntarily give over to third parties every detail about their lives.<p>In these types of analyses, the doctrine of reasonable expectation of privacy is a good candidate to supersede the third party doctrine. The argument would be: I reasonably expect that the third parties whom I entrust with my private data and metadata will not disclose it except as required by the courts.<p>The question then is whether this expectation is reasonable. One theory holds that any time you give your information to anyone else, it&#x27;s the same as giving it to everyone. You have no reasonable expectations that someone else will keep your data private.<p>But that theory seems outdated to me. Participation in modern society is preconditioned on trusting others with our private data. It&#x27;s not optional. (The response that &quot;you can always live in a cave instead&quot; is neither realistic, humane, nor consistent with the values of a free society.)<p>Not only must you allow third parties access to your private data, you rarely have a meaningful choice about <i>which</i> third party, or the ability to negotiate the terms. Where I live, there is exactly one ISP. There are a number of cell phone providers, but to my knowledge, none offer a privacy guarantee, and I can&#x27;t negotiate for one.<p>Because we have no choice but to trust third parties, it seems morally right that we should have a reasonable expectation of privacy when we do so. You can voluntarily surrender your privacy, and that&#x27;s fine, but you shouldn&#x27;t be forced to do so in everyday circumstances. This is a subjective judgment, but it&#x27;s one I make based on what I consider widely held beliefs about the nature of a free society.<p>> In my opinion, <i>privacy</i> is obsolete in a world where people voluntarily give over to third parties every detail about their lives<p>The relevance or obsolescence of privacy is a spectrum, not a binary choice. Right now, we have less privacy than we used to, but we are far from the point of it being wholly obsolete. Have you really thought through what <i>that</i> world would be like? Are you OK with the idea that your every word and action is recorded forever and potentially subject to scrutiny by everyone who will ever live? (Extreme as that sounds, it&#x27;s what we mean when we say privacy is truly and wholly obsolete. Anything less that that is just partway along the spectrum. So be careful when you say something like &quot;privacy is obsolete&quot; without any qualification.)<p>Consider the stress imposed by 24-hour surveillance. Every moment of your life, you would have to dedicate part of your consciousness to calculating how your actions may be interpreted by others, some of whom may be hostile to you.<p>When you search for something on Google, do you want your coworkers, bosses, friends, and enemies making inferences about your thoughts? Do you want to give potentially hostile parties the opportunity to build a damaging narrative around what are in truth innocuous searches?<p>When you begin typing a sentence, and then revise it because the first version didn&#x27;t express what you wanted it to, do you want your critics to be able to read the first version and make claims about your &quot;secret, true intentions?&quot;<p>When you have a drink with your friends in the privacy of your own home, and you make an off-color remark, do you want to be the victim of an Internet witch hunt after it gets posted to YouTube?<p>When a gay middle schooler visits itgetsbetter.org, do you want the bullies at their school to know about it?<p>When you read a political blog, do you want your boss with diametrically opposed political views to find out about it and pass you over for promotion, never telling you why?<p>You may think these scenarios are far-fetched. But they are all logical implications of privacy&#x27;s obsolescence. As I said before, anything less extreme would be an adjustment to our current notions of privacy, not the obliteration thereof.<p>Now, if you&#x27;re arguing for the latter (adjustment not obsolescence), that&#x27;s different. It&#x27;s only realistic to believe that ideas of privacy change over time. And we must think carefully about how they&#x27;re changing, and whether it&#x27;s for the best. But that&#x27;s far, far different from surrendering to the idea that privacy is obsolete altogether.",1379961658

If <i>any organization</i> holds <i>your data</i>, is it still <i>your data</i>, or have you surrendered ownership of it?<p>2. Is there a concept of ownership for record-oriented data, captured by a third party?<p>If you store a copy of a screenplay you&#x27;re writing in the cloud, you haven&#x27;t surrendered ownership of it. The cloud provider cannot just copy your data and hand it to someone else, who now has ownership of it.<p>Let&#x27;s say you are generating a novel by writing short paragraphs, which are then recorded by your cloud provider as records -- time and content. The contents of the fields are created by you. Can the cloud provider simply provide a copy of that data to anyone who asks?<p>There&#x27;s not much difference between a phone call record and my time-content example. Most (all?) fields in a call record are generated as a result of the user, who is more or less the author.

When press the dial button, we are creating these fields of data. It is an act of creation. We expect that AT&T will <i>use</i> this data to bill us (and we find that acceptable). We do not, for example, expect AT&T to <i>sell</i> our call records to some company, for marketing purposes. If the data is owned by AT&T, then they would be perfectly free to do that.<p>There&#x27;s a pretty simple principle that could be followed: If the cloud provider or telecom company wouldn&#x27;t grant access to the information to any member of the general public, access shouldn&#x27;t be granted to law enforcement without a warrant or review of some kind.

Though I&#x27;ve had it pointed out to me that if I were to have my company valued in some way, either by taking funding at a higher valuation or by getting it appraised, I could probably qualify as a high net worth individual and invest already...that&#x27;s a process I don&#x27;t want to go through.<p>I think this is definitely a democratizing influence on capital.

It&#x27;s a full-time job: I put out two new episodes every week, plus a &quot;special&quot; every month that takes quite a bit more effort. That leaves me with about half my time for developing the business. I&#x27;m bootstrapping this, so it&#x27;s just me. I don&#x27;t plan to hire any employees until there&#x27;s more money coming in. (I also make a few hundred a month from royalties on my book [2], which is truly passive.)<p>I&#x27;ve talked about Let&#x27;s Code JavaScript on HN before; check out the previous thread [3] for some details about how I started and market the site.<p>Since simonswords82 was so generous with details about his business, I&#x27;ll do the same. About 2% of the visitors to the site sign up for the free trial. That seems poor, although I don&#x27;t have a lot of insight as to what the number &quot;should&quot; be. I do require a credit card in order to sign up for the trial. The trial automatically converts to a subscription after seven days.<p>About 70% of trial subscribers convert to a paid subscription. This seems pretty good to me, although I&#x27;d of course be happier if it was higher. Once they&#x27;ve subscribed, I lose about 25% of subscribers in the first month, and then the number drops asymptotically down to about 5% (of the initial total) per month. I&#x27;m reasonably happy with this as well. It&#x27;s poor by the standards of a SaaS, where a churn rate of 1-2% is doable, but I think it&#x27;s pretty good for a content site.<p>My most recent push was an inbound marketing campaign: I took one of my monthly specials and turned it into a dedicated site on object-oriented JavaScript [4]. That was very successful; it nearly doubled traffic in the first month (from 2,800 uniques in the previous month to 5,400) and looks like it will permanently add about 1,500 uniques per month. Trial rates went down slightly as a result, but overall subscriptions went up.<p>The biggest challenge for me is having lots of things I&#x27;d like to pursue, but not enough time to do them all. The Object Playground inbound marketing campaign was successful, but a lot of work. I recently released another special that might make a good inbound campaign (on large-scale JavaScript fundamentals: modularity and automated cross-browser unit testing), but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the time it would take to create a marketing site for it on the scale of Object Playground.<p>For now I&#x27;m focusing on A/B testing various ideas for improving conversion. It takes less effort and potentially has longer-term impact. So far, I&#x27;ve improved the subscribe page [5] by adding testimonials and a better design. Next, I&#x27;ll probably provide more opportunities for people to preview the series without signing up, as well as more obvious calls to action on the video pages. I also have some other plans in the works that I can&#x27;t talk about yet. :-)<p>[1] My screencast is <i>Let&#x27;s Code: Test-Driven JavaScript</i>, a series for professional JavaScript developers.

In the absence of dark energy, and for a universe whose masses possess escape velocity (no more and no less), the classic zero-energy assumption of modern Big Bang models, the overall curvature is zero (i.e. flat). For a universe that has less than escape velocity and will recollapse, an idea that has now been pretty much abandoned, the curvature is positive.<p>The escape-velocity zero-curvature universe has an interesting property -- it has zero net energy, i.e. gravitational potential energy is exactly balanced by kinetic energy. This means the universe can appear spontaneously, like quantum virtual particle do, but on a larger scale.<p>&quot;Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing ... Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist.&quot;  Stephen Hawking in &quot;The Grand Design&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not qualified to say what a negative curvature might do to that pretty spontaneous-creation picture.

They are an acquisitive bunch, having spent $4.7 billion on deals since 2011 (37% of their enterprise value as of 30 June 2013 or 57% of their market capitalisation as of today). <i>All</i> their acquisitions since 1997 have been in the banking, insurance or shipping/transportation spaces, with the exceptions of EFI Global (environmental services).<p>Their CEO, Prem Watsa, is a value investor. Fairfax&#x27;s IRR is around 20% - this means Blackberry needs to yield about $840 million in cash a year to tread water. That seems unlikely. Instead, I think we will see a spin-off of the handset business and patent portfolio with a retention of the cash-flow generating service business.<p>What&#x27;s the service business worth? It made $3.2 billion annualised the last quarter (Q2 FY 2014), $3.9 billion in FY 2013, and $4.1 billion in FY 2012. Let&#x27;s assume it keeps declining at 8% a year. Let&#x27;s further assume it can return at least the entire company&#x27;s FY 2013 40% gross margin. Guess what 40% of $2.9 billion declining at 8% annually and discounted at 20% is worth over the next 10 years? $4.7 billion.

If steam promises massive takeup of SteamOS, then it&#x27;s in their best interests to make them available for it.<p>From the demand angle, lots of games are console only because they fear piracy on PC versions. But if all these console users are offered a cheap new platform they can use just as easily as their consoles, it&#x27;s safe to say that many of the users who buy a steambox would start buying games on it too. Console gamers aren&#x27;t going to suddenly turn into torrent junkies because they wouldn&#x27;t need to. This would make the PC platform profitable again. And if they start pricing games cheaper, like Steam games are liable to be, piracy would go down even further.

No serious investor would do that. Don&#x27;t be stupid.<p>You must make sure the valuation is fair, this means - check the valuation report, check the reputation of the company who did the valuation report, sanity check it, look for signs of bullshit.<p>Keep in mind, even if the founders have solid reputation there may be some unethical MBA behind the scenes who can act without founders understanding exactly what he is doing.",1379959304

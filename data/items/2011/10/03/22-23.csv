But why not publishing a half-complete project? Publishing may help you find contributors. And the early feedback helps you to decide if your project is worth more intense attention.<p><i>> Messy/hacky experiments?</i><p>If the code is not too bad, I publish even that stuff (as long as it is big enough to be notable), e.g.<p><a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/vserver"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/vserver</a><p><i>> Completely idiotic/backwards stuff done for fun?</i><p>I recently published such a project and got surprisingly great feedback:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3061050"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3061050</a><p><i>> Play-projects purely attempted for ""ha I did it!""?</i><p>Why not? You never know who'll like it anyway, e.g.<p><a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/hosh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hosh/</a><p><i>> Legally-grey (or blatantly illegal) projects?</i><p>Depending on how much trouble this might cause, you probably shouldn't upload it anywhere. Even a ""private"" repository on GitHub/BitBucket might be too risky.<p>On the other hand, I know about a Free Software clone of a game that used the original graphics and music. Not quite legal, but the game was very old and the right holders obviously didn't care. However, after publishing the project got a little fan base that eventually included graphic designers and musicians, who replaced the proprietary stuff step by step with their own creations. So the game changed from ""legally-grey"" to ""solid free"". This would never have been possible if the game hadn't been published.<p><i>> Or even school projects?</i><p>My school projects were about the first ones I published, and I'm pretty proud about what I wrote in that age, e.g.<p><a href=""http://davis.sf.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://davis.sf.net/</a><p><a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/voji/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/voji/</a><p><a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/volt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/volt/</a><p>Later I also published some notable university project works (sorry, German language):<p><a href=""http://www.profv.de/uni/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.profv.de/uni/</a><p>However, these are only project works. I will never publish specific solutions to homework excercises, as this would only help cheaters and nobody else.",1317682694

I use about 100 minutes a month, so it doesn't matter.<p>My wife, however, makes at least 60 minutes of calls on more days than not, keeping in touch with friends and family (basically all the social lubrication I do with email and Google+). For her, the network effect is incredibly strong: all her friends and family are on Verizon, so she is very hesitant to switch as she gets the in-network minutes free. It was a huge deal for her when I announced I wanted to leave Verizon (for a Virgin Mobile Android) and how many minutes that would add to her plan.<p>I think a lot of people are loyal to their network not because of what they get from it, but about the people they know on it.",1317682655

3068548,comment,3067460,3067460,14,0,waterhouse,,,"The book ""Against Intellectual Monopoly"" is highly recommended reading for the question of patents (and other intellectual property).  The authors make a mostly empirical survey of the effects of intellectual property laws and of their absence in a wide range of industries, and conclude that their effect is a <i>stifling</i> rather than an encouragement of innovation.  I think it's especially appropriate because, while my own opinion on the issue comes from moral reasoning (and it's generally frustrating to try to argue that side), this book presents a wealth of stories and statistics that are just plain interesting to anyone who cares about the issue.<p><a href=""http://www.dklevine.com/papers/imbookfinalall.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dklevine.com/papers/imbookfinalall.pdf</a>",1317682588

We have an enormous library of content built over the last 10 years that we intend to support into the future. Adobe seems to be considering HTML5 as an alternative/addition to the Flash Player. There's a lot of conflict in the industry about Flash/HTML5, and Adobe is appeasing both sides by continuing to develop the Flash Player while investigating HTM5 export, acquiring and developing prominent HTML5 tools, etc. This is fantastic.<p>Do you have any recommendations for teams with lots of Flash-based content, to prepare for the transition to an HTML5 environment? Can we continue creating Flash content as we always have, trusting that Adobe will provide a means to migrate/recompile our existing FLAs or SWFs to HTML5 when the time comes? Or should we take any preparatory action to ease the transition? For instance, authoring our graphics using SVG, writing our code in an intermediate scripting language that may be compiled to ActionScript or JavaScript, etc?<p>I realize you might not be the best person to ask about this, but in your position it seems probable that you'd be aware of the roadmap for Flash. I realize the roadmap is confidential, but any tips or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Alternatively, if you could recommend someone for me to talk to about this, I'd be grateful.<p>EDIT: Any sort of response would be great.

The app lets the user create funny pictures, so I thought it would be cool to have an online gallery with user-created pictures, where people could vote on the best ones and have a weekly top list. Now this is far from trivial though, suddenly I need online storage, a database for users and votes, and a webservice to handle all of that. So I looked around, found Node.js, MongoDB, Heroku and S3, signed up, started reading, learning and coding. 2 Days later and the first version is done and working. How much did I know about this before and how much does this stack cost me? Almost nothing.<p>So where's my point with this? First, this kind of story would be impossible just a few years ago. When you realize, how it's now possible for a small developer to reach potentially tens of thousands of users, without the need of a big budget or being in control of delivery channels.

It would print 1500 lines per minute alphanumeric, and 1800 lines per minute when only numeric values were being printed. It cost $243,450. Its reliability was somewhat suspect. I walked through the room that it was kept in every day for a year, and the only time that I ever saw it working was at a trade show in Los Angeles. The main reason that I went to the show was that I heard that the printer was there and working. I suspect that the printer was a strong contributor to the demise of Toni Schumans' career with Burroughs. Doug Bolitho was giving a plant tour to a group of potential customers one day and he somehow had the printer printing something. Toni walked into the room and loudly exclaimed ""My God it's working"". She left Burroughs shortly after the incident.""<p>It's an excerpt from an autobiography.  The article as a whole originally came up because the author worked for a summer with Donald Knuth - as in, Donald Knuth of the Art of Computer Programming, the quintessential tome of accurate, elegant, academic, truth-on-a-whiteboard computer science.  Presumably Knuth sometimes walked by the non-operative printer some days in the morning too.  His job at the company was to write a compiler, and reportedly it was a very good one.<p>Success and failure in the state-of-the-art have always coexisted.  I sit here - as an iPhone programmer, who has recently had to deal with annoying provisioning issues, LLVM and GCC compilation problems, and advertising networks - and I can look through the window of my office to see our printer, which is located behind the water cooler, available over a wireless network, and can accurately print a requested piece of paper the first time I send a print command from my laptop.

PhoneGap is in the process of being contributed to the Apache Software Foundation, and will remain free and open source.  That said, we're definitely interested in continuing to support PhoneGap's development via contributions from the Nitobi team.  PhoneGap Build, the hosted service based on PhoneGap, will become part of Adobe.  So part of the value is that service, but the key is simply enabling efficient, expressive design and development across devices, regardless of technology.  We're excited to investigate what integrations will make sense, but right now it's too early to say.",1317680122

Might as well blame browsers for giving designers access to millions of terrible color choices via CSS while you're at it. Blame bad designers for not knowing how to use fonts.<p>The community was <i>not</i> doing a good job with custom fonts for headings, pull quotes, etc. @font-face works pretty well, but foundries clearly weren't willing to sell licenses for it the same way they do for print/commercial use. It's not a difficult thing to explain to clients - it's a recurring fee just like hosting, SSL certificates, and domain registration. It handles all cross-browser issues, saves bandwidth, and gives you, the designer, easy access to a rather large library of fonts at no cost to you. Clients that can't afford the $2-8/month probably can't afford good design to begin with.<p>If web fonts are too slow for you in all circumstances, how is Typekit any worse than a license from a foundry? Native fonts are great, and should be used extensively, but they really limit your options.",1317680065

Think of a lawsuit as a road rally. The plaintiff has to hit a number of checkpoints.  In federal court, one of the first checkpoints is that the complaint---that is, the plaintiff's formal statement of its claim---must allege enough facts to set out a <i>plausible</i> case entitling the plaintiff to relief.  (This is the <i>Twombly/Iqbal</i> standard established by the Supreme Court a couple of years ago.)  Even if the defendant doesn't show up, usually the judge and his or her law clerk will still read the complaint, to see if it passes the smell test, before granting a default judgment.<p>2. They can sue you for buying a router, but under section 2-312(2) and (3) of the Uniform Commercial Code [1], absent a proper warranty disclaimer you would normally be able to pass the buck to the seller, by filing a cross-claim for breach of the implied warranty of noninfringement. Of course, that too would require paying a lawyer, unless the seller stepped up and voluntarily assumed the defense of the infringement suit (which is not uncommon; vendors want to stay on customers' good side).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-312</a>",1317679315

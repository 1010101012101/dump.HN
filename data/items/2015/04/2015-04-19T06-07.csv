However I would strongly disagree that digital photography represents any kind of evolution.  Digital photography is simply a new tool, nothing more, nothing less.  It has its own aesthetic, process, and result.<p>The vast majority of people take terrible pictures and are undoubtedly better off with digital.  It&#x27;s quicker, it&#x27;s cheaper, and it&#x27;s easier.  But when talking about a skilled photographer and printer, the differences between digital and analog become more apparent.  Digital looks like digital, and analog looks different.<p>For your average snapshot, digital probably yields better average results.  But in my opinion, I&#x27;ve not seen a gallery quality digital print that I thought matched the quality of the best analog prints.  Digital looks strange to me, especially at larger sizes.  (I think it might have something to do with the way edges get rendered.)  That&#x27;s just my subjective taste, others might prefer digital.  I certainly don&#x27;t hate digital, I just don&#x27;t like it as much.<p>Regardless, I think the important point is that photography is an aesthetic art form, and therefore you are going to have people that prefer one or the other aesthetic.  It&#x27;s not a question of good or bad, they&#x27;re just different.  To say that &quot;There is literally nothing that film cameras can do that digital camera&#x27;s can&#x27;t do, and in most cases do better&quot; I think misses the ultimate point.  The thing that digital hasn&#x27;t been able to do, is look like analog.<p>P.S.

I used Netapp around 2007 in one bank as iSCSI storage for a SQL Server solution, and later on in 2008 we selected it for a  small online bank (80 employees,500 financial advisors, 20-30k customers) as crucial part of our infrastructure. We were able to design the IT infrastructure around it using it as CIFS file servers for internal Windows users, NFS datastore for the VMware infrastructure (we were almost all virtual) and iSCSI block access for some special machines (e.g. SQL Server) with relevant software in place for backups and with full sync metrocluster replica between the two sites. No FC host-access.
It was clearly expensive, maybe not that exceptional performance-wise, but I&#x27;m quite sure even today you can&#x27;t do it with all the new fancy storage vendors.At that time, we could have done it with EMC, but our experience with the sales process was opposite to the one reported by some here: during the 1st purchase for SQL, I was able to find a Netapp pre-sales technical guy that was very competent, while I struggled to get the right replies from an EMC reseller.<p>EDIT: I think I should probably add that the competent Netapp pre-sales guy moved to DataDomain, then Fusion-IO and now he&#x27;s in PureStorage..",1429423691

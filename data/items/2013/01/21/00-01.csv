5089131,comment,5088586,5088586,2,0,bcoates,,,"Hey, don't lump C++ in with this. If you write code in the STL weenie style or the Pretend It's Java style there aren't any idioms I know of that would ever violate the rules he mentions (out-of-range pointers, signed overflow, invalid aliasing).  I don't do those things and the C++ programmers I work with don't do those things, at least not habitually. I don't see violations of undefined behavior rules, or the use of idioms that come close to it, very often in our code. Not nearly as often as the sort of mundane errors that no language can prevent.<p>These are not problems of a language per se, but the original sins of neo-vaxocentrism and confusing ""I understand how this might work, at some random abstraction layer"" and ""I can depend on what happens when I do something stupid"". Free your mind of these and the rest will follow.<p>These low-level bit banging errors are vastly less common than shared-memory concurrency issues, which as far as I can tell are endemic to all code that attempts shared-memory concurrency, in any language. If you want to have an axe to grind about languages that aren't future proof, look there.",1358729968

It's not so much that they favor large institutions, as they're trying be moderate and consider both sides of the argument.<p>By contrast, read the editorial pages or the comment sections of the Wall Street Journal, in which Obama is regularly characterized as a Marxist ideologue and worse, and any sort of regulation or disciplinary action against the financial services sector is characterized a shakedown, at best.

People bitch and whine about things, wanting people to change the world and yet don't do a single things themselves to make it happen. I hate the mentality that it's up to everyone else to solve serious problems when Raganwald is wasting his time whining about people not solving real problems behind his computer screen oblivious to the fact there are people out there trying to make a difference. Curing things doesn't happen over night. After the initial study, it can take upwards of 10 years before a new drug can come to market.<p>Maybe people aren't solving medical issues because it's not easy. Case in point: a man by the name of Thomas Shaw engineered a syringe that after it's use the tip retracts inside of the syringe to prevent people from jabbing themselves, an obviously genius idea, right? He's worked on the design for over 15 years and has failed to crack into the market, although accomplished many other notable contracts and things other budding start-ups wanting to crack into the medical market could only dream of. Other companies have copied his device, he's had to fight even though his device has been proven to be the best in comparison to others.<p>The medical industry is not only tightly regulated, it's heavily infiltrated by super lobbyist groups. Doctors taking kickbacks for exclusively using a particular medical supplier or company regardless of safety or price.<p>Having said that, what makes this guy think people aren't out there solving problems? While diabetes is a serious medical issue, it's manageable. But I would much prefer resources are allocated to illnesses where they're only treatable for so long before you die, like you know cancer and leukaemia.

That also typically means my focus is very very narrow, and doesn't lend itself to marketability.

But I can't and I won't (if I am being honest with myself), because all I know about prostate cancer is the PRSS3 enzyme. There are other factors that causes prostate cancer.<p>People who are experts in their fields are generally stuck on the narrow field they're in.

So I've been kinda forced to use Leiningen, at least for now (because I still don't know Clojure well enough to do without it).<p>Wanna quickly add a private .jar file / private repo?  Good luck.  Oh, it's doable, sure (I did it).  But it's a major pain in the arse.<p>People will say: ""But you shouldn't use free-floating .jars"".  Well, guess what... I like 100% reproducible builds that do not need to connect to Internet to be build.  So now to have reproducible builds we need to have not only our DVCS but also our local Maven repository.  Major major pain.  I much prefer to have my jars managed by myself and commit them directly in the DVCS.<p>People will complain that it's not the correct to do it: but meanwhile I've got an easier time reproducing builds than they do...<p>During all my Java years (more than ten) I always managed to dodge Maven and the rare projects I inherited that were using Maven were utter mess.  People will argue that it's because of people, like me, who don't know Maven well enough, that the entire projects (and builds) became utter junk.  Whatever.<p>Another area where Leiningen/Maven really do not shine is when you don't have Internet access (like, you know, in companies which have separate networks, including ones non-connected to the big bag Internet).<p>Major major pain.<p>And what happens if you have an Internet connection but some high-target repo gets rooted and a major Java .jar gets replaced with a version containing an exploit?<p>Millions of devs account instantly owned by automagic Maven updates to your project.<p>It hasn't happened...

So I'm ""staging"" my development by using a dev account which has no Internet access and another one which does (it's easy to do on Linux, where you can trivially use per-user firewalling rules).<p>I've always been amazed at how many devs cannot correctly configure a Java classpath themselves and need to be babby-sitted by a tool like Maven.<p>As soon as I'll understand better how Clojure and how Clojure builds do work, I'll do just like I've always done with Java projects: custom scripts building from known good .jar files.<p>Not some magical tool constantly ""phoning home"" and being a security disaster waiting to happen...",1358727468

5088890,comment,5087214,5088583,11,0,goodcanadian,,,"It is very hard to do anything. For decades, both China and the Soviet Union supported North Korea as a buffer to keep American soldiers away from their own borders. Neither country liked the North Koreans very much, but they didn't like each other very much either, so the Koreans could play one off the other to get away with whatever they wanted. Moreover, there was no possibility for the Americans or the South Koreans to do anything without risking war with the Soviets and/or the Chinese.<p>This situation changed somewhat with the fall of the Soviet Union. I believe the article has a chart of the freight tonnage crossing the border that shows a sharp drop off at this time (I saw the chart somewhere last night). The loss of aid from the Russians exacerbated the North Korean famine in the 1990s. The Chinese still continued to support the Koreans as a buffer state, however. Recently, it has become clear that the Chinese have grown somewhat ambivalent to the whole situation (wikileaks, for example). It is now unlikely that they would defend North Korea in a war, but they do still think of it as their backyard. For the Americans and South Koreans, the prospect of going to war against the North with a possibly nuclear armed army of 2 million soldiers is not very appealing.<p>I would say that the Chinese influence is growing as the Koreans have not been able to play them off against the Soviets for the last 20 years. More and more (capitalist) Chinese investment seems to be occurring, and the country seems to be opening up ever so slightly, though the Koreans still act pretty randomly.<p>One final note, I have been watching North Korea for a few years, and I would say there has been a very important sign of opening up. Last night, I watched a video from a tour where the guide at a collective farm talked openly if not completely honestly about the famine. A few years ago, they would not have even admitted that the famine occurred and blamed it on American propaganda. The door has been wedged open a little bit, and I am hopeful that a new generation of leadership that has grown up without the benefit of Soviet support will allow things to open further. Then, we may be able to do something productive about the atrocities that sadly still occur.",1358726618

No matter how much money you throw at the problem, retirees can not draw on more resources than physically exist.

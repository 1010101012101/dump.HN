The consensus seems to be that Motorola's portfolio was good enough to bully <i>other Android makers</i> (which they'd publically threatened to do) but not good enough to deter Apple/MS from suing them (which they are!).  If that's really accurate, then Gruber's negative characterization is correct - it looks like the Moto purchase might have been needed to keep Android in the game at all, not to advance its position.",1313503184

Almost half of my consulting work in the last 18 months has used Clojure. Based on the quality of projects written in Clojure and some very good decisions that Rich made, Clojure's developers' market share will continue to grow.<p>That said, Common Lisp is a great platform and for some applications, Scheme is a fine language choice. Common Lisp has a high learning curve and many developers will not want to invest the resources to master it. About 10% of my consulting work in the last 10 years or so has used Common Lisp and before that I used some form of Lisp for many projects at SAIC starting in the early 1980s. Although the Scheme library situation is getting better, I personally use Scheme for my own small projects that tend to be all new code, often just to think about a problem. Gambit-C with its custom Emacs interface is probably my favorite coding/experimenting environment.<p>I would say that the future of Lisp is looking good.",1313502827

2891082,comment,2890841,2890841,7,0,barrkel,,,"This approach is highly compatible with recursive descent, and I'd recommend its use in place of how recursive descent normally deals with arithmetic expressions involving multiple levels of precedence because of how it eliminates redundant recursion, but I wouldn't push it much past unary and binary operators. I think the trivial translation from (non-left-recursive) BNF to recursive descent code is valuable enough to negate any performance gains from Pratt-style parsers in general coding. Perhaps the only exception would be dynamic grammars, i.e. parsers which have to deal with a grammar that changes dynamically during the parse - this is where a table-driven parser comes in handy, as it's usually easier to generate or modify tables than code.<p>I don't think the performance advantage is very significant outside of expression-style parsing either. To explain why, look at a simple grammar (written in EBNF using some regex operators for succinctness and avoiding left recursion):<p><pre><code>    program ::= statement* ;\n    statement ::= (expr | while-stmt | for-stmt | if-stmt | compound-stmt |) ';' ;\n    while-stmt ::= 'while' '(' expr ')' stmt ;\n    for-stmt ::= 'for' '(' expr ';' expr ';' expr ')' stmt ;\n    if-stmt ::= 'if' '(' expr ')' stmt [ 'else' stmt ] ;\n    compound-stmt ::= '{' statement* '}'\n    expr ::= simple-expr (('<' | '>' | '==' | '!=') simple-expr )* ;\n    simple-expr ::= term (('+' | '-') term)* ;\n    term ::= signed-factor (('*' | '/') signed-factor)* ;\n    signed-factor ::= ['+' | '-' | '!'] signed-factor | factor ;\n    factor ::= <number> | <ident> [ '(' [expr (',' expr)*] ')' ] | '(' expr ')' ;\n</code></pre>\nThe grammar above is trivially convertible to recursive descent, with each grammar rule becoming a single method or procedure.<p>This kind of grammar is typical for a programming language, particularly one inheriting from Algol. You're usually in some kind of context: a declaration context, a statement context, or an expression context. Within any given context, there is usually a group of potential non-terminals available, but each of those non-terminals begins with a single specific token - e.g. 'if', 'while', 'for' etc. in a statement context in C or Pascal. Visually speaking, the graph for the root non-terminal for any given ""context"" (e.g. statement in the above) looks broad and shallow.<p>The counter-example is the equivalent graph for expression (expr in the above). It is narrow and deep; this is necessary to encode operator precedence in the natural translation to recursive descent. In order to parse 1 + 2, a whole raft of rules need to be burrowed into: first expr, then simple-expr, term, signed-factor, factor; and all the way back out to simple-expr, which will parse the '+'; and then all the way back down to factor again, and back out. This is where Pratt parsers excel; they remove all these redundant nested calls.",1313501961

Thanks to Paul Graham and other lisp writers, the power\n  that macros provide programmers is widely discussed, yet is\n  unfortunately still widely misunderstood. Despite the wisdom regarding\n  macro programming that can be gleaned from a simple perusal of On\n  Lisp, few programmers make the connection between the macro and their\n  real-life programming problems. While On Lisp will show you the\n  different types of macros, this book will show you how to use them.\n</code></pre>\nHaving read about half of <i>On Lisp</i>, I think that's a fair claim.  I am\nvery glad to be reading it, it is a wonderful book, and thanks to it I\nknow what a macro is and what it can do, but haven't really come away\nwith a good feel for when to use them myself in my own code.

Web host responds badly (but perhaps with some justification, outside parties getting involved in disputes, where a simple pay-the-outstanding-invoice would have resolved the situation)<p>5.) Non-payee gets abusive<p>6.) Web host deletes the account for abusive behaviour.<p>Apart from point 3, everything else seems in order. The customer's friend was provoking a reaction in public. What did he want, the webhost to publicly state that his friend's account had been suspended for non-payment? That seems worse than a firm private message to butt out of a contractual matter.<p>Suspending the customer's friend does seem harsh, but taken from the view that he's complaining publicly about a problem that doesn't involve him, it might be a long term justification of ejecting bad customers instead of just tolerating them (perhaps there's more to the story).  That sort of approach is recommended by things like The 4-hour work week, firing your worst customers.<p>The guy should have paid his bill, either on time, or as soon as justified. There was no reason for his friend to escalate matters, there was no reason for the non-payee to escalate matters. You pay for the service, you get the service. You don't pay, then you get no service. Yes, the web host can be more lenient, but it's not something you should feel entitled to.<p>There are a number of extenuating circumstances that can warrant or could result in one or more of these points being appropriate responses.<p>And look at it, it's a cpanel / shared-hosting reseller - those margins are razor thin to non-existent, even loss-leading.

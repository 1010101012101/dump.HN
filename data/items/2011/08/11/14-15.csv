2873135,comment,2872597,2872759,3,0,dpark,,,"> H4ck3r N3ws H4ck3r News H4cker News Hacker News<p>This is a terrible idea.  It's one thing to ask a person to remember which characters they replaced in a word.  It's another thing entirely to ask them to remember three different ways they swapped characters.  This is a recipe for having to brute-force your own password.  It's also still not as secure as you might imagine.  There's very little entropy added by swapping characters (even though I do it as well), because there are very few substitutions that people make.  ""Hacker News Hacker News Hacker News"" is nearly as secure as your convoluted 3rd passphrase, but a lot easier to remember.<p>The repeat-three-times thing is probably not great advice, either.  If this became popular, it would be trivial to add this to brute-forcing code, and it doesn't add as much entropy as adding just one extra character.<p>I don't think the XKCD suggestion is actually good, either.  Open a book and pick a medium-length sentence.  There's your passphrase: an n-gram chosen arbitrarily from the corpus of (probably) English literature containing mixed-case and punctuation.  You've got a ton of entropy there.",1313074647

A utf8 decoder should reject portions of utf8 streams that don't use the shortest possible encoding, but not all do.  If there are multiple ways to encode '<', then an xss prevention filter is going to have trouble.<p>The attack described here is simpler: two unicode codepoints, roman 'o' and cyrillic 'o', usually look identical.  So by substituting cyrillic we can make a file called 'hosts' that the operating system won't pay attention to.  This is the same problem with punycode internationalized domain names, where paypal.com might be spelled with a cyrillic 'a' and mislead people.  The fix for domain names was to restrict what unicode you could use where.  I'm not sure what the fix is here, aside from always showing hidden files.",1313074372

You can grab a sentence from your favorite book and use it.  e.g. ""How do you do, Miss Doolittle?""

It might be in the way it was written (author could have been pressed for time and compressed what he wanted to say).<p>How many years have we validated the effectiveness of ""Get out of the Building"" already? Not talking to customers before version 1.0 is against this highly effective principal.<p>Lean startup is not just 'iterate'. It's really a ""huge customer feed back loop."" You iterate based on things you learned from customers.<p>Replacing 'tech' with restaurant might make it easier to understand. The author is suggesting releasing food to users at a restaurant opening, prior to actually testing whether people want that food, think the food is good, or even if that food is appealing to the correct customer segment.<p>What the author and most commenters have already gleamed, is that customers can be wrong. But they can also be right. The same principles apply to founders as well. Here is a quote from Eric Ries:<p>## _Learning and executing customer feedback skills is as important as coding._ ##<p>Carefully snipped from: <a href=""http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2010/09/visionarys-lament.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2010/09/visionarys-lame...</a>\nGo read the entire post.\n""\n...<p>This is where data, focus groups, customer feedback, and collaborative decision-making get their bad rap. In many cases, these activities lead to bad outcomes: watered down vision, premature abandonment, and local maxima.<p>When visionaries say but customers dont know what they want! they are right. Thats the problem with false dichotomies: each side has a kernel of truth within it. You cannot build a great product simply by obeying what customers say they want. First of all, how do you know which customers to listen to? And what do you do when they say contradictory things?<p>...<p>I recommend a mantra that I learned from Steve Blank: always consider your job to find out if there is a market for the product as currently specified. Dont try and change the vision every time you get new data. Instead, get out of the building and look for customers for whom your product vision is a slam-dunk fit. If and only if, after exhaustive searching, you cannot find any customers that fit the profile, is it time to have a serious conversation about whether and how the vision should be modified (a pivot).<p>...\n""<p>Now read the post title again, ""Avoid Customer Feedback Before Version 1.0"".<p>You see, its actually fundamental to keep the feedback loop going _as early as possible_. Even before version 1.0. This is why I don't agree with the article author. Again, it might be because of the way the article was written (it's always good to have more details) and trying to compress a startup in several paragraphs is near impossible.<p>Your goal isn't to put out a 'complete' app. Your MVP should be focusing on only providing a solution for the very defined simple and tiny problem which you found. In that exercise you will have to filter through customer feedback. Feedback includes metrics gathering whether or not people are using your product and if people are clicking on the wrong stuff. This kind of feedback helps you correct usability issues.<p>You cannot just go out and ask users ""What features do you want."" That is nuts. You need to script it carefully, you need to engage and ask users about ambient ideas, feelings, thoughts. Sometimes you also just need to let the customer speak. You will need to develop customer skills. There 'might' be some interesting discoveries along the way.<p>Eric Ries and Ash Maurya recommend about about 30 minutes for customer interviews and the script is VERY carefully put together as to AVOID ""what features do you want"".",1313072165

It's by far the best way to understand your market - figure out what problems they face, what they (think they) want, and what they might be willing to pay for it.<p>I've spent the last year working on a new product.  (What can I say, I'm slow!)  At several points I've thought that I've spoken to enough potential customers, that I've got all the information and understanding of the market that I need to go on with...  And then another potential customer pops up, I speak to them, and gain valuable insights that I never would have imagined I was lacking.<p>These conversations haven't really slowed me down; if anything it's the opposite.  They've helped me make decisions that I was struggling with and they've helped me to prioritize what's important.  I think they've helped me to avoid costly mistakes.  Every month I feel more comfortable with the product that I'm soon to launch.<p>And I can still change direction after launch, if it makes sense to do so.<p>It's not just about figuring out what features your product should have.  It's about figuring out what types of people (or companies) are going to want to buy it, which you can most profitably target, how much they're likely to want to pay, and how best to sell it to them (e.g. what about your proposed product really pushes their buttons?).

Very strange that I should make that observation about Cuban, but there it is.<p>We already have this incredible sophisticated and involved system for creating jobs -- its called the startup market. Each year, tens of thousands of folks come up with ideas to do things people want, and that always means creating a job, if only for the founders. Each year folks invest, or not, and those folks get a shot at succeeding.<p>So we have tens of thousands of highly-motivated folks putting their own lives and money on the line to make jobs. How could this possibly stack up against BigCorp getting subsidies to create busywork?<p>The Tea Party used to be non-partisan, at least in theory. Probably never really were, though. But there's a critical non-partisan meta point that you have to acknowledge before you spin off with a bunch of creative top-down ideas: we've been here before. Every time there's an economic problem people come out of the woodwork with all sorts of totally awesome ideas. Some of these work, some don't. The only difference between these implemented ideas and the startups I mentioned is that these ideas are huge things and we can only do a few at a time as a nation.<p>I think this creative problem-solving is great, but you have to face facts: been there, done that. Whatever we do, we have to have a system that continues to let us come up with and fund these ideas when we need to. Running huge deficits and debt loads over 100% of GDP doesn't let us do that. [insert argument about how I exaggerate when exactly we become limited in our options, but note that at some point even the hardiest Keynesian must realize that the time has arrived.] So debt arguments are not necessarily about philosophy for how to run the economy and create jobs, they can be about the simple <i>ability to do so.</i><p>If you ask me, we need to talk about policies that are going to create millions of failures from the bottom-up, all trying to build things to help folks. Not trying to pick among the hundreds of great ideas for the top 3 or 4 that we then throw hundreds of billions of dollars at. It might feel great all rallying around one or two cool ideas, but this is a numbers game. We need to play it intelligently.",1313071238

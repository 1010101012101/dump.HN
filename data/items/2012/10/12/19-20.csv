4646591,story,,,1,1,JeremyMorgan,"Ask HN: Do you use Setters and Getters in PHP? ",,"I'm ashamed to admit that I have known about setters and getters for a very long time, and used them sparsely, mostly due to what I thought were time constraints.<p>What I learned a couple years ago is, NOT using them can be a bigger loss of time when you're updating something a lot. In an effort to write better stuff I start doing tons more data hiding, and using setters and getters (like most people do in other languages anyway) and found the following things:<p>I can sort of enforce type safety in PHP.\nI can create better interfaces and hide implementation better.\nSanitizing the data is far easier. Usually just have to change it one place.\nCode is much cleaner in many places.<p>So my question is, are you using them? Is there any good reason not to?",1350071992

I'm one of the Scripted guys, let me chip in on that.<p>The team working on Scripted are also the guys creating language/framework tooling on the bigger IDE platforms - so writing Eclipse plugins. The real developers using those tools are starting to write more JavaScript whilst at the same time there is the new wave of developers coming straight into JavaScript who aren't great fans of IDEs - usually from the point of view that they are a bit 'heavy' for what they are trying to achieve. We even surveyed some teams about what they were using for JavaScript and that confirmed this tendency towards more lightweight editors.<p>We could have just done our usual thing and crank out more eclipse plugins but we wanted to investigate something more radical. I, myself, still use vi when I'm on the command line because it is so easy and just works. We wanted to create something with that convenience and speed but that had the key capabilities that can really help productivity - so early error indication through things like JSLint as well as good content assist and fast navigation.<p>We are also aware of the increasing buzz around Cloud IDEs and wanted to explore that too. We tried some prototype full Cloud IDE setups (so server side workspace with browser interface) but didn't get much traction. This approach of desktop client/server app with potentially movable server let's us start where we think users want us and grow to server side workspace setups later. I know this setup is working for me as we are using Scripted to develop Scripted.<p>If you haven't seen it, there is a bit more detail in my blog article:\n<a href=""http://blog.springsource.org/2012/10/11/scripted-a-javascript-editor-from-vmware/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.springsource.org/2012/10/11/scripted-a-javascrip...</a>",1350071977

You see, the course is all about understanding what sensations are and the effects that they have in our psyche. So one of the goals is to limit as much as possible all sources of sensations so that you can easily focus on a few and see how the mind reacts to them.",1350071962

4646587,comment,4645844,4646032,3,0,mck-,,,"It's that feeling of being in the zone, completely forgetting about tomorrow's worries. But how does one raise awareness of being in the zone? It is that consciousness that I believe is  paramount.<p>Training your consciousness by playing sports vs sitting in lotus is analogous to training your biceps by rowing vs biceps curls. The latter is more targeted, hence more effective.<p>When you do what you love and you completely emerge in it, yes, you do get in a state of bliss. But are you conscious of it? If not, which is mostly the case when you see a group of people play soccer in the park, then I don't think that is beneficial in the meditative sense. Your mind is still very much active.<p>The reason why the traditional way of meditation is so effective (and has therefore been used for millennia), is because it is quite hard to just sit still and do nothing. And really clear your mind of any thought whatsoever.<p>It is this mental challenge that will really train your consciousness and raise your awareness.<p>An easier way to get started is to combine the two methods, in the form of tai-chi. Get your exercise, while clearing your mind (and raise your awareness). It has helped me a great deal -- my life has been so much smoother after I trained Tai Chi for 4 intensive months in China.<p>If you're interested, I blogged about that experience a while back: <a href=""http://kuomarc.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/tai-chi-in-pursuit-of-happiness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kuomarc.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/tai-chi-in-pursuit-o...</a>",1350071912

Many, many submissions to HN are based at bottom on press releases, and press releases are well known for spinning preliminary research findings beyond all recognition.

University and medical journal press releases versus journal articles""<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/related-by-coincidence-only-journal-press-releases-versus-journal-articles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/related-by-coi...</a><p>points to the same danger of taking press releases (and news aggregator website articles based solely on press releases) too seriously. Press releases are usually misleading.<p>The most sure and certain finding of any preliminary study will be that more research is needed. All too often, preliminary findings don't lead to further useful discoveries in science, because the preliminary findings are flawed. The obligatory link for any discussion of a report on a research result like the one kindly submitted here is the article ""Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation"" by Peter Norvig, director of research at Google, on how to interpret scientific research.<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>Check each news story you read for how many of the important issues in interpreting research are NOT discussed in the story.<p>Here, a big problem with the press-release-based submission is that depression is a disease that goes into spontaneous remission, on different schedules for different patients, so to say ""Patient was given a treatment, and the patient started feeling better"" proves nothing when n = 1, and doesn't prove much even with much larger sample sizes until careful statistical analysis of the patient sample is done as part of a thoughtful comparison with a control group. Some depression patients get better regardless of the treatment, and some unfortunate patients stay depressed even when given treatments that are known to be reasonably effective in the general population. Depression is a polygenic, multifactorial disease, a disruption of the complicated mood regulatory system in the human brain, with its several interacting feedback loops, so no two depression patients are seeking care with exactly the same underlying disease state.<p>It was interesting, by the way, to see the mention of research at Medtronic in the submission here, as that is a LARGE local company in which many of my friends work, and at which one of my immediate relatives worked not long ago (although he worked on a different kind of medical device, not on a brain device). As heart disease rates continue to decline worldwide,<p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-why-we-die-global-life-expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-w...</a><p>the former bread-and-butter of medical device companies (heart pacemakers and other heart devices) are a shrinking part of the market, long-term, so the medical device makers are doing research to see if other human diseases can be treated with electrical medical devices. I think the people who conduct research at medical device companies are persons of integrity who desire to help sick people, but it is MUCH too early to predict that a medical device will ever be a first-line treatment for human mood disorders. Much more research on safety and effectiveness still needs to be done before that happens.<p>P.S. There was quite a good recent thread here on HN<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4511188"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4511188</a><p>with helpful advice about what to do about depression.",1350070673

There's so incredibly much data available on the internet. If that was the limiting factor, it would just be a matter of throwing more data at T to increase the amount of information in M, but that doesn't help if we haven't found the right machine learning algorithm L. And searching that space is the real challenge of AI. To search that space we either need human experts, huge amounts of computational power to brute force, or some combination thereof. We've tried human experts alone for decades, without much success, so I think it's likely that we will need some computational assistance to find the right algorithms. That's why AI people love throwing around graphs of Moore's law.",1350070055

It has the advantage of putting the conversation on a quasi-scientific footing, and it impresses people too. :)<p>> Option number three gauges interest in a scientific manner, but assumes that interest is a valid proxy for the end goal of a sale. I'm not sure how true that assumption is.<p>Yes, fair enough. But remember that online advertising pays by the click, so someone, somewhere believes it's a valid measure of future sales, even if the click is all there is.<p>Maybe 500 people click, and only one buys. The outcome is still related to the click-through rate, and the pay-per-click scheme still works. If there was any serious doubt about the value of paying for clicks, people would refuse to pay -- they would try some other approach to online advertising and metrics.<p>> Testing all the way to the end of the funnel (home sale) is key, and difficult.<p>Absolutely. You would have to interrogate the buyers, and I venture to guess no one will want to push that idea.",1350070030

My most recent misery in this segment is Tiny Troopers. It's a great little game that you can play to pass 2 minutes, or dig in and spend an hour or so working through the campaign missions. The problem is, the game is tainted by free-to-play. It actually makes it a worse game than it could have been.<p>Gaming is, first and foremost, about balance. If a game is too hard, players get discouraged and give up. Too easy and there is no satisfaction in winning. This is not a secret. Every game developer knows it, and many game enthusiasts are acquainted with the subject once they start to investigate the question of ""why"" they enjoy a specific game so much.<p>The trouble with free-to-play is that our wallets end up on the balance scale. How hard, or easy, the game is depends upon how much I'm willing to pump in to this little game. They make the game too hard to play without paying anything, but once you open your wallet, things can easily get way to effortless.<p>In order to develop truly <i>great</i> games, the developer needs to control the difficulty.

During mindfulness meditation, yes, resisting urges is part of what you're supposed to do.<p>The basic process goes something like:<p>1) Sit down in a comfortable position that you can stay in without moving.<p>2) Take deep breaths through your nose and focus your attention on the sensation of air moving over your nasal passages and into/out of your lungs.<p>3) When other thoughts come into your head or you find yourself thinking about anything other than your breathing, gently direct your attention back to your breathing.",1350069041

Who do the small/medium datacenters use to build their custom hosting hardware? It's likely someone like Ma Labs where you get quite a savings over Amazon/Newegg, particularly when you buy components for many servers at a time.<p>Pay in advance, when it makes sense and is possible. Talk to colo operators, you can likely get a better deal if you pay for 1/3 years up front.<p>When you build the hardware yourself, you can do things no operator can do for you... tailor it exactly for your own domain needs.<p>Analyzing your domain needs to define server roles that you might need (e.g. load balancer, app server, relational database, hadoop cluster, nosql database, key/value stores like redis, etc) will lead you to commonalities in hardware/components needs. Now you can develop a few physical server types, order in bulk, and not have to keep so many spare components on hand.<p>For us, we are able to split out our datacenters by ""critical""/""non-critical"" for huge cost savings. Our ""critical"" datacenters host traditional production level servers. Things that MUST have up times of four/five nines. We can get 50Mbps 95th percentile, quarter rack, 10 amp for roughly $400 a month. These are great, but you have to make the most of each U.<p>We do a lot of machine learning, map/reduce, and general processing. The app needs this, but because I coded for it... if the uptime is, say, 99% and not 99.9999% it has VERY little impact on our end users (think of these as worker dynos). Now, I can have a whole rack here at the office able to handle for 90% of outages without issue. The nice thing about this is, I no longer have to make the most of each U. I can now build servers completely different than I would in a traditional datacenter. It also comes with little added expense to our normal operations (add redundant internet, networking, UPSes, and insurance). I can build a 1u, 25 ECU-equiv, 32GB, SSD based server for ~1.1k.

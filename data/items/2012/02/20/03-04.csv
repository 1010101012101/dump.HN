Even gamers/buyers like it due to lower ping in some cases.<p>iiNet and Internode are becoming one ISP, so they're two brands soon. iiNet seems to offer policing users with copyright infringement notices as a compromise due to relentless lobbyists. Again, I believe these compromises are a result of political tactics of Door in Face technique [1] and Overton window technique [2].<p>Labor party does not care if there's many surveys, polls, rallies against it. They're still considering the mandatory filter. I have similar concerns about the Liberal party wanting an Internet filter since they publicly stated that Labor's Internet Filter is not effective enough. Fortunately, they are not accepting an Internet Filter for now.<p>> While Australia doesn't require parliamentary approval to go to war, the countries that do, the US in particular, don't seem to pay that rule much heed, so I'm not sure how much would change if such a rule was on the books.<p>Democrats and Republicans jointly voted for the Iraq War. I'm not sure why you say they're avoiding that. Labor party was vocal in their opposition to Iraq war. If they were actually trying to gain votes, then well done. Seems like a cheap tactic that would be absolved with the parliamentary requirement.<p>> They can meet in secret as much as they want, but fortunately, they cannot pass laws in secret. Until a bill is introduced, such meetings are of no concern, nor are they in any way unique to Australia.<p>There are secret international collaborative exercises such as ACTA that erode Internet Freedom that were only initially exposed due to Wikileaks.

Whatever is happening in another part of the Earth doesn't change a thing from the perspective of the guy getting shot.<p>This is true if you include your sense of self as your entire body. However, I think I will have to decide that my sense of self is my memories stored in my brain. If you look at it from that perspective than as long as my memories, and everything else at the sub-conscious level, is persisted across any medium then I'm still alive. The body then becomes a vessel. However, I think I will still like to have my body so I might as well replicate that also.<p>Of course, I think this is a choice people will have to make themselves since it is true that the original you dies, as you state. The original body of yourself dies, but not your memories. I guess you could think of your memories as your soul. As long as those are alive, you are alive.<p>>>So suppose we change the story a bit: we don't create a new copy of you, but we still shoot the old you. For you (the old you) this isn't any different than the previous story. Would you still go for this?<<<p>Of course not. Why would anybody do that? I'm not sure what is the point you are trying to make here. Notice that in this case not only has my body died, but also my memories. So as far as the universe is concerned I'm truly dead.<p>If for whatever reason a new me cannot be created than I expect the original me to be woken up.

Ubuntu is pretty easy to setup if you are a complete beginner.<p>Why use Linux?<p>You should start tinkering with Linux, because it is the most common development environment used.<p>Using Linux will allow you to learn basic troubleshooting and debugging. Those two skills are necessary if you desire to build any kind of application.<p>Linux will also allow you to try out different languages with a simple command (such as sudo apt-get install clojure1.2 (which I did two hours before writing this post)).<p>Then you can pick a language to learn the basics. By basics I mean how to write variables, functions, etc. A nice language to learn this is python, because it has a very simple syntax (syntax is how a language is written (like the difference between written English and  written French)).<p>After learning how to write the basics, you should decide on a simple project to work on. One project that I reccomend beginners is to do a simple Rock/Paper/Scissors game. Focus on making it work, then focus on making it play against itself.\nThis exercise will allow you to see your code work, and will keep you busy for a couple of days.<p>After that, you should head out and build a web app. Anything is fine, but a good project to start with a simple blog. You can use Python, but PHP is simpler to run, and is super simple to setup on your computer, thanks to a program called XAMPP (look it up, and install it).\nWith PHP you can do all sorts of things. From calculators, to message forums, to whatever you desire.\nYou can also pick an existing app and try to copy it. One fun project would be to copy hacker news, and adapt it to whatever topic you'd like.\nOr even build your own basic facebook, or a simple search engine. Try and build existing stuff.<p>One great thing about web apps, is that you can also learn to code various languages that interact with each other. You can mix PHP (or any other server side language) with javascript ( client side language (client means that it runs on your web browser and not on the server)).<p>At this moment, you should be pretty good at the basics, and may be ready to explore other more complex stuff. Maybe pick up a LISP-type of language. Or maybe you could try an polish your javascript skills. Who knows?<p>Here are some other pointers:<p>You should not limit yourself to one platform, one language.<p>Learning how to program takes years, not because writing the code is hard, but because designing real applications that work is quite difficult. This is the engineering side of it (and where most people fail, and/or quit).<p>Don't be afraid to try new (to you) things. You broke Linux/Windows? Who cares! Re-install and try again.<p>I started to tinker with computers at age 8. Took me years before I could even write coherent code (though I still wonder if my code is coherent). Yet, I'm here, enjoying it.<p>One final note: Don't quit. Quitting will make the biggest diference in your life. Keep going, even if slowly. You will get it.<p>Good luck!<p>My best,<p>code pockets",1329708634

The high quality of these long form articles are one reasons why people pay to read the Times. Presumably, the Forbes post will not be in print.<p>The NYtimes.com has 16.3m monthly US visits, Forbes has 10.5m. [Compete] The NYT article has 435 comments (sign of high engagement) v. Forbes' 155.<p>I'm not sure how he pulled the total FB share data for the NYT article - they don't display that sharing information in the same way Forbes does.<p>In short, despite the validity of Nick O'Neil's main point - that a more descriptive title and a synoptic treatment can travel well - his rhetoric is more than a little overblown. Details matter, and what the Times article includes is deep context, originality, and above all, diligence.<p>As far as a regurgitative blog post making anyone's career... ha, I guess? Only if you want your career to be limited to that activity. The Forbes writer knows it - that's why she includes 6(!) links to the original article, as well as a plug of the original writer's upcoming book. Careers are built on respect, and the most valuable quality a writer or article can have is credibility.

3611191,comment,3609569,3611035,10,0,grellas,,,"I have mixed feelings about a loser-pays system and have articulated the reasons why I believe that such a system can sometimes work undue hardships on average people who go to court to try to obtain redress (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1792353"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1792353</a>). While such a system would undoubtedly serve to deter certain forms of abusive litigation, I think its benefits would be outweighed by the detriments it might bring.<p>As to the chances of its ever being adopted in the U.S., I think these are basically nil. The U.S. departed from the UK on this issue dating back to the formation of the country and both judges and state legislatures (which now fashion these rules) are very committed to the current rules. Among other things, those rules are seen as helping plaintiffs (such as consumers and personal injury victims) and those who fashion such rules are not prone to disturb the existing system because of this. Moreover, in cases where legislatures do consciously want to tip the balance, they enact special statutes that allow for fee-shifting <i>in favor of</i> plaintiffs (e.g., in certain civil rights cases where a plaintiff can get a fee award as prevailing party even though traditional rules would require such a party to bear its own fees). With sentiments (and prejudices) being so heavily weighted toward plaintiffs in general, I don't see any movement whatever toward a loser-pays system even though this might help lessen frivolous litigation (I do believe that an occasional U.S. state has adopted such rules but this is a rare exception).<p>By the way, I don't see the Oracle case as frivolous. It is, in my view, grossly overstated in its damage claims but it may be that Android is infringing certain of the patents and that Oracle may be entitled to some damages. I say this even though I am not sympathetically aligned with Oracle's case and believe it was a mistake to bring it. As to the final outcome, only time will tell.",1329708100

The current stable release is r60, and most Go users have recently switched to tracking the weekly snapshots in preparation for Go 1 (mere weeks away).<p>Second, and most importantly, they demonstrate the web.go and mustache.go libraries. These third-party libraries were written shortly after Go was released (in 2009 or perhaps early 2010). Since then, Go's standard http and template packages have seen a lot of development and should now perform much better than web.go and mustache.go.<p>Third, there's a new ""database/sql"" package in the recent weeklies that provides a single interface to SQL databases. There are several drivers available, including sqlite, so it's relatively easy to implement the database part of the benchmarks in Go, too.<p>Given the task of benchmarking frameworks, I suppose the author thought it necessary to reach for a framework. That explains why he looked outside the standard library for these tools. Fortunately for Go programmers, the Go project regards http, templates, and databases as core functionality in its standard library.<p><a href=""http://weekly.golang.org/pkg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weekly.golang.org/pkg/</a>",1329708063
3611189,comment,3609067,3610882,2,0,Aramgutang,,,"> There's mandatory Internet censorship in Australia, in a sense that it's funded by the government and users have no choice except to leave.<p>This is simply not true. There are two ISPs: Telstra and Optus, who voluntarily block websites from a list provided by the government. However, I don't know anyone who actually uses those ISPs, and they're more expensive to boot. The other major ISPs, such as iiNet and Internode, have no intention of implementing the filter, and in fact actively and successfully fight government interference in court. They're also cheaper, and in my experience provide superior customer service.<p>If the government decides to impose restrictions on NBN access, the latter group of ISPs are highly likely to fight it in court, and are quite likely to win.<p>And furthermore, given the fragile position the Labor party is currently in, it has shelved its plans for mandatory filtering, and is unlikely to reintroduce them, as it alienates their voter base, who are increasingly driven toward the Green Party, which is now in a position of significant influence and vocally opposes Internet censorship.<p>> Both parties have been known to support the ability to declare war without parliament<p>While Australia doesn't require parliamentary approval to go to war, the countries that do, the US in particular, don't seem to pay that rule much heed, so I'm not sure how much would change if such a rule was on the books.<p>> There's many secret copyright enforcement meetings and rumours<p>They can meet in secret as much as they want, but fortunately, they cannot pass laws in secret. Until a bill is introduced, such meetings are of no concern, nor are they in any way unique to Australia.<p>> Did you know that police can now issue $1320 on-the-spot fines and confiscate all electronic equipment deemed involved in piracy?<p>No I did not, and could not find any sources to corroborate that, nor examples of such fines actually being issued.

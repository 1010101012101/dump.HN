Some inconvenient syntax is a small price to pay for the confidence that node.js isn't going to get turned into another regurgitation of Java meets Perl by hordes of perfectly well meaning but unsatisfiable  programmers who want everything to work like the things they know. I don't mean to insult the makers or users of other languages, just to highlight the distinction of Javascript.",1302616796

2437164,comment,2436728,2436728,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"Here's the issue: employee productivity generally falls into four categories: multipliers, adders, subtracters, and dividers. Adders are the ""vital force"" of the company who ""do the work"" from a ground-floor perspective, multipliers are managers and tool-builders who make others <i>more</i> productive. Subtracters are the harmlessly unproductive people who don't bother any one but produce less than their salary merits-- they should be mentored and turned into adders, if possible. Dividers are the vampires (severely incompetent programmers, bad managers) who make other people <i>less</i> productive and destroy companies. Fire them.<p>A lot of these entrepreneurs were great at being adders and decided to start businesses in order to capture more of their value-added. The problem is that, once you're a manager, you cannot help but have major effects on other peoples' productivity and can therefore only be a multiplier or a divider. If you're a micromanager, you're going to end up a divider. These entrepreneurs/managers need to transition from an ""adder"" context to a ""multiplier"" context. Unfortunately, this transition is difficult and painful because it requires ""letting go"" of detailed control; you make more money and have power, but you're support staff as much as you're a ""boss"".<p>As much as I find his suggestions impractical for the rank-and-file average people, I think a lot of neophyte managers need to read Tim Ferris's <i>Four Hour Work Week</i>. Their goal should be to enable others' productivity and make themselves mostly unnecessary (as managers). This means they have to trust their subordinates to do good work. Most will, a few won't-- and when the latter happens, tough decisions need to be made (can he be trained? Or do we need to fire him?) But starting from the assumption of ""I'm the only person who can do things right around here"" is going to lead to failure: the best people leave, the middling people degrade-- when you manage people like children, that's what they become-- and the incompetents don't get found out (and trained or fired) because the managerial meddling makes it impossible to differentiate who is capable and who is not.",1302616408

Each language is different and excels at it's own niche.<p>Ocaml has functors and modules and polymorphic variants and compiles to very fast native code. F# has more libraries, units of measure, and better support for parallelism. What is innovative about F#? Getting proper generics on a runtime like .NET is not something to scoff at. F# was one of the first languages to support view patterns - pattern matching on objects. Balancing OOP with functional, as well as very smooth interop with .NET is its own accomplishment. Leveraging a language that balances FP and OOP well will lead to a powerful style of language that simply is not well explored at the moment. Scala is another one with this feature.<p>Actors, First Class events and async can have you write code that is either parallel, reactive, concurrent or asynchronous easily. Workflows (monads) are also innovative and with inlining you can write succinct code that is faster than C# in certain cases.<p>As someone who is using F# to write some machine learning code (as well as thinking about approaching genetic programming, something dead easy in F#, with category theory in mind) its future plans on typed datasets in the language are intriguing.<p>As for Linq its innovation is that it is a generalization of list comprehensions. Here is what Erik Meijer has to say:<p><i>""A lot of people, when they hear LINQ, they even think about ""It's something that has to do with SQL and databases"". I don't think people realize that any type that implements these sequence operators you can write queries over, like in Haskell, as long as you are going to implement the monads type class - you can do binds, return and so on. All that's comprehension and it's exactly the same here. It will just take a little time before people have discovered that and they will write the most crazy LINQ implementations.<p>These things take time and I think it's good that they can get used to it in its current shape for lists or for collections that they understand. They will go on and do state monads and exception monads - I don't what - because if you look at the sequence operators, they are the monadic operators. What is also interesting is that, besides ""select from"" and ""where"" we also have ""group by"" and ""order by"", which are not in Haskell's comprehensions. Then the funny thing is what happened is that the Haskell guys saw that and said ""That's quite useful"". Simon Peyton-Jones and Phil Wadler wrote a paper where they improved the Haskell comprehensions with things from LINQ, so it is a nice circle going on where the languages influence each other and get better.""</i>",1302616111

2437123,comment,2436800,2436800,5,0,6ren,,,"Will today's cheaper, more accessible technology for making movies end up disrupting the big studios?<p>It does bring movie-creation within reach of a great many more people; and disruptive distribution channels are also growing (amazon; netflix; even appleTV/iTunes; plus the growing ""home theater""), as alternatives to movie theaters.<p>The question is consumers: they have access to movies made with the highest level of technical expertise, screenplays, character actors, stars, franchises, marketing - and movies are <i>cheap</i> to rent already (plus, piracy drops their price to zero). Why would consumers select one of these indie movies over the major studio movies? In a head-on comparison for the mainstream, these indie movies would seem to have everything stacked against them.<p>But indie movies aren't new, and there has always been a niche for them - just not the mainstream. What is changing is their quality is increasing. What they really need is slightly bigger niches, where their non-big-studio qualities offset their not having all those other advantages. Do these bigger-niches exist?<p>I'm not sure that they do. Even foreign language fims - made to very high standards, with huge niches - are regularly remade by hollywood, and with much greater commercial success in the mainstream. When people pirate movies, they seem to pirate mainstream movies, not indie ones...<p>Here's what I think will happen: as soon as any film-maker gets a foothold of some success, he will be co-opted by the big studios - as they have done with the idea of an indie film (notice how ""indie"" films often have big name actors in them these days?) They are still masters of the value networks for making mainstream movies: theaters, stars, marketing.<p>Technology isn't the main commercial barrier to making movies, so reducing it doesn't undermine their business.<p>What could change it is:<p>(1) if there were customers who prefer the indie films, because they are more accessible or cheaper. But everyone can access films, and privacy makes them free - denying indie entry.<p>(2) or if, even without a nurturing niche, indie films could become of such high quality (according to the mainstream) that they could take business away from the big studios. This would provoke a fierce competitive response from the studios, and they have so much non-technical power that it seems unlikely.<p>What can happen is disruption of the traditional distribution channels of video rentals (there's bankruptcies there already I think).<p>But probably not theaters (people like the theater partly because it is <i>not</i> home - they are going out - there's the energy of a mass of people; a different environment/atmosphere etc). Maybe cheaper projection equipment will change the way it's done (e.g. there are now complexes that show many more films, in smaller theaters), and that may disrupt traditional chains to some extent, as discount stores disrupted department store. But I don't think so: theaters have always been priced so that everyone can afford them; I guess what might change is accessibility, with small theaters opening up locally. But this niche is already filled; those small theaters can just upgrade their equipment and keep making money in the same way - the cheaper technology is a sustaining innovation for them. Unless someone works out a way to use it disruptively... (maybe showing more films, more recently, at cheaper prices, by using smaller theaters).",1302615808

Yesterday, the day before go live, I had to take it over and completed 90% of the work in a single long day.<p>It's not that he isn't trained... These are basic Linux engineer tasks.  It's that he works so slowly, and has to ask so many questions ""how did you want me to create the user accounts?"" - ""I don't know, with useradd, perhaps?"" Then 2 weeks later, I say ""the client is asking if they can login to their boxes now; are their user accounts created yet?"" - ""I'll get to that today, he replies.""<p>You might think that I must have hired him, so it's my fault if he works too slowly and asks too many questions, or makes too many mistakes to be of much use.  Unfortunately I didn't hire him.<p>The bottom line is that a lot of employees are just poor performers, and when someone that does good work at a high rate of speed can do it better themselves, in less time, they're going to do it.",1302614849

We need enough socialism to prevent economic degeneracy (e.g. an outcome where people become so rich or so poor that fail deals become impossible and the system devolves) and we need enough capitalism to remain innovative, to reward hard work, to put the talented and skilled people (who, for statistical reasons, usually are not born into well-connected elites) into decision-making roles, and to allow people to try out new ideas without having to answer to (government or corporate) bureaucrats.<p>I hate American-style <i>corporate</i> ""capitalism"" with a passion, though.

It's so small that if somebody were to sell 100,000BCN right now, they'd crash the price down to pennies.  And if somebody were to buy 100,000USD of BCN right now, the exchange rate would skyrocket.  It's a small, illiquid market of people who have, mostly for political reasons, decided that they will convert electricity into a private virtual currency.<p>I know that right now there are a lot of bitcoin miners, dreaming of how wealthy they'll be once their deflationary-by-design virtual currency takes over the world, but I can't envision any realistic scenario whereby that could happen.  Heck, the political risk alone makes it untenable as a serious store of value as it would be trivial for a nation to outlaw it's use, thus destroying the utility.<p>If you don't want to store your wealth in government-issued currency, that's great.

Or in some cases, connections to get them started and skip ahead of the hurdles other children that you don't hear stories about would encounter.<p>I'd be more interested in stories where the kid isn't from a family where dad is a wealthy lawyer and the kid has a sure thing at a prominent university ahead of him and where the kid's mom and dad aren't professionals in the industry that are available to encourage, advise, support, and assist on behalf of their child.

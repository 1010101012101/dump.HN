In this case, I recommend reading up on Modern Portfolio Theory and Asset Allocation or, if you just want practical information, just get a basic book like the Bogleheads guide.<p>Basically, since stocks are risky, investors typically hold a combination of bonds and stocks. Also, because the returns for bonds and stocks are (somewhat) uncorrelated, a portfolio with a mix of bonds and stocks can have better returns with less risk (variance) than a 100% stock portfolio. Assuming your bond and stock holdings are diversified (e.g. you buy and hold index funds), the main long-term investing decision you have to make is the % you allocate to bonds and stocks.<p>2) What&#x27;s the case for small investors to buy individual bonds instead of just investing in a bond index fund? Well, depending on where you are, you can buy government bonds without brokerage fees, so your costs might be lower. But in that case it&#x27;s harder to invest the coupons by yourself.<p>Of course bond returns are lower, but the risk is much lower too. In the case of short-term bonds issued by most developed countries, the risk of default is extremely small. The main risk is that unexpected inflation eats your returns.",1424084307

And then wait as some guys were inevitably slower than others, and some people wanted to pull their prices before I got them all. And the more complex the product, the longer it took (swaptions for instance). And of course once you&#x27;d picked someone to trade with, everyone wanted to know what price it was.

---
Gabor began to read about a group of American scientists who had carried out something called the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study. It is the most detailed research ever conducted into the long-term effects of early childhood trauma. It looked at ten different terrible things that can happen to a kid, from physical abuse to sexual abuse to the death of a parent, to track how it shapes that child over their lifetime.<p>These scientists discovered that for each traumatic event that happened to a child, they were two to four times more likely to grow up to be an addicted adult. Nearly two-thirds of injection drug use, they found, is the product of childhood trauma. This is a correlation so strong the scientists said it is “of an order of magnitude17 rarely seen in epidemiology or public health.” It means that child abuse is as likely to cause drug addiction as obesity is to cause heart disease.18<p>Another long-term study, published in American Psychologist,19 followed kids from the age of five until they were eighteen, to figure out how much the quality of your parenting while a child affects your drug use as you get older. When the children were still small, the scientists gave them a task to carry out with their parents—like piling up building blocks—and then they watched how well the parents helped and encouraged them through a one-way mirror. They wrote down which kids had parents who were loving and supportive, and which had parents who were disengaged or nasty to them. It turned out the kids whose parents had been either indifferent or cruel were dramatically more likely to heavily use drugs than the others. They had grown up, they found, less able to form loving relationships, and so they felt more angry and distressed and impulsive a lot of the time.<p>If we can figure out at the age of five which kids are going to be addicts and which ones aren’t, that tells us something fundamental about drug addiction. “Their relative maladjustment,” the study found, “precedes the initiation of drug use.” Indeed, “Problem drug use is a symptom, not a cause,20 of personal and social maladjustment.”

9056148,comment,9014795,9017431,0,0,NotableAlamode,,,"You didn&#x27;t answer to any of my points. Let me briefly address some of your rambling.<p>(a) &quot;gradual de-industrialization of Greece and the changes to agriculture imposed by EU directives&quot; That&#x27;s wishful thinking. Can you point to the EU directives that
deindustrialised Greece? You mean all the billions and billions that
the EU gave Greece to modernise and to build up a working
administration?<p>(b) &quot;In the EU, we see Germany pushing for them constantly.&quot;
No you don&#x27;t. You see Germany slowing down the US who are the chief
driver behind sanctions against Russia. Germany has major economical
interests in Russia. Germany has also got to accommodate US demands, after all the US is still occupying Germany. Finally, it is worth noting that the German chancellor grew up under Soviet occupation. Please inform yourself about the facts rather
than mindlessly reciting Syriza propaganda.<p>(c) &quot;I&#x27;m saying, the legitimate government of Ukraine was toppled to be
   replaced with some pro-West-interests friendly&quot;
This is not the time and place to discuss what is going on in Ukraine.
Let&#x27;s just say that what you write here is indistinguishable from what
the Kremlin says.<p>(d) &quot;So?&quot; My salient point (that you did not address) was that plenty of countries
started from a much worse place than Greece and are doing much better
after a couple of years. Go to South Korea some time ... Maybe look at
your neighbour Turkey and see their stunning economic development.<p>(e) &quot;(whereas Greece had around 1.5 million Greek populate living
   under Turkish occupation in Asia Minor that it tried to liberate&quot; Look what you are doing here: you justify greek imperialism and racist
wars, conveniently forgetting that lots of people living in Anatolia
were not Greek and had no intention of being governed by Greece.  Most
countries have some of their citizens living in neighbouring
territory, so what you are doing here is legitimising invading your
neighbours.<p>(f) &quot;But even if it wasn&#x27;t so, your example would just mean that the
   Greeks also owe to Turks, not that Germans don&#x27;t owe to the Greeks
   for what they&#x27;ve done.&quot;
As has been pointed out before, and is widely known by anybody with interest in this subject, Germany paid reparations a long time ago. This has all been formalised
in contracts with the allied occupiers. If you think Greece didn&#x27;t get
enough, please address the occupiers in charge, i.e. the US, the UK,
France, and the Soviet Union.<p>(g) &quot;Mostly thanks to being the new darlings of the West, in a cold war
   ploy against USSR/East Germany Europe. Not exactly &quot;left to their
   own devices&quot; and with hard work, as the myth says.&quot;
You are channeling that odious Varoufakis guy. If you / he really
belived that, then the rational thing to do would be to go to
Washington (or rather the CIA headquater in Langley, where Varoufakis
claims such decisions are taken) and ask for Greece to be the new
darling ... and magically Greece will become the new Switzerland /
Singapore. Neither you nor Varoufakis do this. In Varoufakis case
that&#x27;s because he doesn&#x27;t believe this -- it&#x27;s just easily consumed
propaganda for dumb voters, in your case ...<p>(h) &quot;Greece went under financial supervision as a result of exactly that.&quot; Greece didn&#x27;t pay Turkey for Greece&#x27;s war of imperialist agression. So
your moral position is that you expect others to do what you yourself
are not willing to do.<p>(i) &quot;Germany with its already high exports had tried to deny any policy
   to weaken the Euro for ages, hurting EU countries with less
   fortunate import/export ratios.&quot;  You clealy don&#x27;t understand
   macro-economics. A weakened Euro helps Germany more, because
   Germany exports more. A weakened Euro makese German products more
   competitive.  That aside, Greece doesn&#x27;t export much to speak of to
   non-Euro countries.<p>(j)  &quot;I mean that German companies, like Siemens&quot; I still don&#x27;t see your
point. According to <a href=""http://www.transparency.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.transparency.org</a> Greece is a lot more
corrupt than Germany. You could find numerous Greek companies and
individuals doing dodgy things with their money ... how much tax are
greek shipping magnates paying again?<p>In essence you are following Syriza, and whipping up racism (in this case
anti-Germanism) so as not to address your own problems. It&#x27;s a well-known pattern

Russia, just out of the Soviet union had the pledge only to drop it.<p>If you look at the countries that have the pledge its none of the earlier adopters (Nato or former Soviet states). This is important because it signifies that the pledge is more of a political statement to provide comfort to existing nuclear states at the time the pledge was made.

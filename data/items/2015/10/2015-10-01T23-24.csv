In user interface design, catering to multiple levels of user expertise is an ancient concept. This can be an actual mode variable in the UI. In expert mode, you see more options.  In command lines, you don&#x27;t see <i>anything</i>, so this doesn&#x27;t seem to apply directly. The program being given command line inputs isn&#x27;t even running until you hit Enter. An expertise variable could be used to adjust the language and level of detail in the help strings and man pages, and to influence what is available when you invoke Tab completion (i.e. don&#x27;t complete on options or sub commands that the novice wouldn&#x27;t know about).<p>Since man pages are driven by nroff macros, the man page aspect of this seems within reach.

Which is a big cost once, but the amortized cost doesn&#x27;t change much.<p>No, it&#x27;s a big cost every time you pass a threshold, which happens an infinite number of times, because big-O assumes numbers can be arbitrarily large.<p>>But in general with these discussions, you assume that certain operations are constant on your &quot;machine&quot;. For instance, addition is usually considered constant even though it isn&#x27;t if your numbers are larger than your machine&#x27;s word size.<p>As long as the max number size is orthogonal to the number of elements n, you can assume a bound on the time for an addition operation, and then it becomes a constant in your run-time expression with respect to n.  No sleight-of-hand there.<p>>In the case of the hash tables, you assume your hash is constant, even if, as you note, it isn&#x27;t really. But the fact is, the coefficient for the O(log N) term is so small, that it doesn&#x27;t really offer any useful insight towards the performance of the algorithm.<p>All true, but the spec for big-O doesn&#x27;t say &quot;assume away stuff that doesn&#x27;t matter in practice&quot;.  It says, &quot;as n gets arbitrarily large&quot;.  When you make inconsistent, varying assumptions between problems, you&#x27;re not doing STEM anymore; you&#x27;re doing memorization, the kind of thing STEM isn&#x27;t supposed to be like.<p>If &quot;the&quot; definition of big-O consistently included a definition that &quot;we never have to deal with more than 2^64 elements&quot;, that would be fine.  Instead, we have to memorize &quot;the right answers&quot; for when you can and can&#x27;t assume that, and only then does O(1) for hash lookup pop out.<p>And if you really just care about in-practice, then you can no safely assume that a typical balanced binary tree lookup takes fewer ops than e.g. SHA256.",1443743380

I just read a lot of nutritional science because I&#x27;m interested in it and so I&#x27;ve strung together some high level patterns.  Reading quickly about CF and ACF, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s related to what I&#x27;m talking about, but I&#x27;ll explain my thoughts on diabetes and how it connects to MPS and growth.  I also want to make it clear I&#x27;m talking about adult-onset, type ii diabetes.  So probably not CFRD, and probably not type i.<p>On a high level the pattern I see is that growing is one of many intense metabolic stressors, and that there are other things that can approximate that stress once you stop growing, specifically strength training, although I think other forms of fitness are probably helpful as well, though less so.  Inflammation is the major biproduct of strength training, and is a crucial part of the muscle building process, and yet we don&#x27;t think of this inflammation as unhealthy (unpleasant, sure) and it doesn&#x27;t cause diabetes.  The most anabolic diet you can eat is one that causes huge amounts of inflammation (high carbohydrate, high protein).  So you have this intense metabolic stress of growing and then it stops in your early 20s and you keep up the inflammation cycles with the same diet and you get diabetes.  You remove this metabolic stress without adding another one and inflammation is bad, you add it and it&#x27;s good (crucial, even).  And finally, someone who has low insulin resistance is going to be the most affected by a highly inflammatory diet.  In a healthy person lowering your body fat percentage is one of the main ways you can increase your insulin sensitivity (and thus muscle building potential).  Spiking your insulin is terrible if you are overweight, but it&#x27;s great if you are trying to build muscle.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s all very vague and I&#x27;m just some dog on the internet, but I think basically there&#x27;s a scientific opportunity to show that strenuous exercise, specifically strength training, can have a much bigger impact on metabolic syndrome than the science currently gives it credit for.",1443742485

10315524,comment,10313489,10313489,0,0,spolsky,,,"Sorry, Prashant, you lost track of the plot of the story somewhere along the way.<p>(creator of FogBugz, here)<p>FogBugz won and Jira won, but they were playing different games.<p>I wanted to make software development better for programmers. When I started creating Fog Creek Software in 2000 programmers were treated like typists. They were not paid very well (my starting salary was $33,000). There was almost no thought around how software should be developed. Companies that scored high on the Joel Test[1] were almost unheard of.<p>The LAST thing I wanted to do was make another tool of oppression for management to impose gantt charts and deadlines and strict rules about who has to sign off on things.<p>I set out to make software development better for programmers by blogging[2] and by building a company that would be a great place to work[3].<p>In 2000 the only way to do that was to bootstrap it. With a team of four people we couldn&#x27;t build anything complicated. We started with bug tracking software because at least we could touch one aspect of programmers&#x27; lives with our philosophy.<p>FogBugz was designed for smaller collegial teams of people that wanted to work together effectively and needed a clean and simple way to track issues using the smart workflows that small, professional teams like to use.<p>It was remarkably successful and profitable from 2000 to today. We&#x27;ve never stopped working on improving it, but we also have never abandoned the market of small collegial teams of smart people.<p>By contrast, Jira was designed as &quot;Enterprise Software&quot; with features to help managers impose specific workflows on teams. Selling Enterprise software is a lovely, profitable business and Atlassian has great success selling to large organizations who ignore FogBugz, but it&#x27;s the opposite of what I wanted to do. Anyway Atlassian is going public with this enterprise software, good for them, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re going to enjoy their well-earned private jets.<p>But FogBugz was the means, not the ends, and at Fog Creek our ambition was not to be the world&#x27;s greatest bug tracker software company, it was to fix things for developers. So we kept plugging away at other ideas. Some of them were kinda dumb. Some were moderate successes.<p>Two of them, Stack Overflow and Trello, were huge hits and spun off into separate companies. Stack Overflow, thanks to Jeff Atwood&#x27;s inspired leadership, has had more impact on making software development better for programmers than any bug tracker ever will. Trello has grown as popular in three years as Jira grew in 15 years.[4]<p>Neither of them would have been possible if we didn&#x27;t have the cash cow of steady FogBugz profits. That&#x27;s what bootstrapping is, folks! You build one thing and use it to build a bigger thing.<p>In the meantime I think the world has figured out that programmers are writing the script for the future that everybody is going to live in, so conditions have gotten better. In big cities employers are falling over themselves to invent new ways to pamper and delight their programmer employees, with the massages and the sushis and the dog yoga. We programmers built ourselves hundreds of amazing tools, from github to npm to ci tools, build tools, IDEs, code refactorers, etc. etc. that make programming a million times better than it was in 2000, and bug tracking is just a slice of that pie and not a particularly important or interesting one.<p>But that said, FogBugz is still very popular and very profitable and thousands of teams use it every day, and we&#x27;re still reinvesting those profits in making it better and in developing new products to make the world better for developers, and even though it doesn&#x27;t support pointy-haired micro-managers and doesn&#x27;t allow you to create a custom workflow requiring that a VP-or-higher sign off on bug reports, there are still small, collegial teams of smart developers who have figured out that this is how they want to work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://joelonsoftware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joelonsoftware.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.fogcreek.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fogcreek.com/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://goo.gl/hTXXPG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/hTXXPG</a>",1443741995

Musicians often call this &quot;color&quot; or &quot;timbre&quot;. Jaw aperture roughly corresponds to the volume of the first formant produced, and how the tongue is raised or retracted within the mouth roughly corresponds to the second formant produced.<p>Even the surrounding consonants leave their mark on the surrounding vowels. For instance, sounds produced with the lips, (like English &quot;b&quot;/&quot;p&quot;), tend to lower the formants of the surrounding vowels.  Consonants produced with the back of the tongue against the soft palate (c.f. English &quot;k&quot;/&quot;g&quot;) tend to &quot;pinch&quot; the second and third formants of the preceding vowel closer together. Collapsing and merging consonant clusters while bringing the tonal variation into the fundamental pitch is one of the most common theories of tonogenesis, or how tonality evolves in languages.<p>Whistled languages based on non-tonal languages tend to whistle the patterns of the second formant, which captures subtle information about what the vowel and surrounding consonants would have been in the underlying spoken language.",1443741153

If someone can claim the world would be better off with faster solutions, they should be able to provide an instance whose solution would lead to a better world.",1443740731

At the same time, I find it strange how insensible browser defaults are for productivity (why do ctrl+F & ctrl+G do the same thing?). Developers tend to zoom around in their text editor at breakneck speeds, but slow to a comparative crawl in the browsers themselves. If I press F12 in Chrome or Firefox, I have no idea where focus even goes.<p>My primary annoyance is how ctrl+L (and alt+D) is the standard &quot;focus urlbar&quot; keyboard shortcut. It&#x27;s definitely one of the most useful actions, but the shortcut requires a large motion or two hands. I rebound it to ctrl+Q for a while, but reverted as I just kept closing browser windows on other people&#x27;s computers.<p>Ultimately, I recommend any person who uses a program often to explore ways of using it more effectively, not just for speed, but also to prevent RSI.",1443740608

The cost here isn&#x27;t in the filing of the patents; it&#x27;s in the nightmarish patent system that results in absurd litigation and related expenses. If the patent system were reformed to avoid this kind of expense, the company would have lower operating costs, which would be distributed in some way.  While it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> I suppose that 100% of those savings would be collected by shareholders as profit, it&#x27;s much more likely that, like with anything else, the cost reductions would simply contribute to the size of the total pie, which would be split among owners and employees in proportions probably roughly similar to how it&#x27;s split today.",1443740587

Of course, none of the academic institutions [our preschools] prepare the new I.T. graduate for these games but rather, leave it to the cold reality of the work environment to teach graduates [the new children] that estimation techniques are only good for teaching in university.<p>> The good news is that I.T. can estimate better. The bad news is that there are lifetimes of games and refining of games that have to be avoided to do this.<p>There used to be a good copy of it easily visible on the web, today the best I can find for you is this PDF copy of the article: <a href=""http://research.cs.queensu.ca/~ahmed/home/teaching/CISC322/F09/files/EstimatingGames.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.cs.queensu.ca/~ahmed/home/teaching/CISC322/F...</a><p>Previous HN discussion (~200 days ago): <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9182814"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9182814</a><p>Also worth a read for a chuckle: <a href=""http://www.dadhacker.com/blog/?p=2267"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dadhacker.com/blog/?p=2267</a>",1443740548

It&#x27;s pretty fragile and requires some trickery and tribal knowledge. You have to hope some forum somwhere has the unlock key to allow applet loading on whatever card you bought. Another single hobbyist maintains a PKCS#11-compatible card applet, PKIApplet. It requires a relatively modern JavaCard version and compatible JavaCards are not always available for individual purchase in the U.S. If you&#x27;re prepared to <i>really</i> get down and dirty with DIY trickery, you might manage to load PKIApplet onto a JavaCard with GlobalPlatformPro.<p>Actually using it requires OpenSC, not a shining example of usability or code quality. It requires specific drivers for different cards, each having slightly different personalization procedures. Many of the drivers in it are for cards that can no longer be purchased. PKIApplet appears to have a driver in OpenSC but I haven&#x27;t gotten an opportunity to test it yet. Much of the tooling you&#x27;ll find references to in documentation turns out to have expired domains and abandoned SourceForge projects last updated 2002.<p>The OpenPGP route appears to be a little less sad than the PKCS#11 route, since at least Yubikey maintains a modern OpenPGPApplet.<p>If your Fortune 100 company&#x27;s CTO wants to play golf with Gemalto, smart cards are for you.

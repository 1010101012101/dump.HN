They can be socially very useful, they may endow their creators with vast profits, or both. So the creation of financial products is strongly incentivized both from the buyer- and seller-sides.<p>However, there are only really two <i>things</i> that we can use to create these products: debt and risk. Thus, when we try to create financial products, we create structures composed entirely of debt and risk, which become very complex. The reason why they become so complex is similar to any other case in which you try to make highly sophisticated structures from only very simple/basic components: there ends up being a great number of details.",1436313534

In other words, the value of a recommendation is not something you can evaluate at the time, before following the recommendation; instead, it&#x27;s a measure of regret. (And by that vein, yes, human recommendations can totally be mistakes, too.)<p>On the other hand, people <i>do</i> tend to try to filter on the recommendations themselves before knowing their regret-value. People will subconsciously multiply the likelihood that something was a &quot;bold recommendation made by design&quot; by the relative status of the recommender.<p>Celebrities, leaders in your industry, people you&#x27;re attracted to, etc. can get away with recommending all sorts of crazy things.

If what the CoC claims is true, that Jamaica&#x27;s law was passed without following the proper process, then that is a problem and it should be challenged whether you want the law or not. You can&#x27;t have a law-making process, trademark protections, etc and then just walk over them when you decide it&#x27;s an important law. The whole point of the process is to decide if it&#x27;s the correct law in the first place!<p>The CoC&#x27;s purpose is to support the interests of it&#x27;s members.

9848940,comment,9844806,9846031,0,0,esseye,,,"This is what happens when people confuse something which reduces complexity, to something which can move complexity.  It&#x27;s important to note that it can move complexity, if you can set up the container host environment in such a way to allow it.  At which point the complexity normally associated with the OS management/systems administrator can largely be moved into build process/software developer complexity.<p>The number of tools which one would suggest you use along with Docker are a reflection of this, and are additional layers to try to provide further movement of host complexity up into a software controllable level (Consul, etcd, yada yada).<p>The whole ecosystem plays well with &quot;cloud&quot; hosts, because their systems people have taken the appropriate steps in creating that host architecture and complexity (which is not gone) for you.<p>As someone else stated well, it is the modern static linking.  I have no idea why people would ever have done &quot;build, test, build, deploy&quot; - that sort of insanity should have been obviously wrong.  However, &quot;build, test, deploy&quot; does not depend on static-ness of everything related to build, but compatibility of environment between &quot;test&quot; and &quot;deploy&quot;.  Those who invested not enough time in making sure these environments were always in sync I think have found a way to wipe the slate clean and use this to catch up to that requirement.",1436313332

Sinai, rather than something colleges themselves might have any responsibility for. Colleges have become giant money-sucking machines, similar to Scientology. In fact, they&#x27;re so similar that I made a handy comparison chart (<a href=""http://rationalconspiracy.com/2015/06/15/universities-vs-scientology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationalconspiracy.com/2015/06/15/universities-vs-sci...</a>).<p>The author here insinuates that the increased cost comes from paying for teaching and research. But this is wrong for at least five reasons:<p>1. Research is not a cost center for colleges. It is a profit center. Usually, research is not funded by the college itself; rather, professors get grants from outside agencies, which the college then takes a large, juicy cut of for itself. (Ask any professor.)<p>2. At most colleges, the number of faculty members per student has remained stagnant for the last thirty years. The author waves their hands about &quot;new areas of knowledge&quot;, but these new areas aren&#x27;t leading to more hiring.<p>3. Wages for tenured faculty have also remained stagnant, adjusted for inflation.<p>4. Colleges are rapidly replacing their tenured faculty with adjuncts, who are given heavy courseloads, and paid peanuts even compared to tenured faculty (barely minimum wage, in a lot of cases).<p>5. Most of the actual work of research and teaching is done by grad students, of whom there are far more than tenured faculty. Grad students are, again, a profit center rather than a cost center, since the university gets to charge them &quot;tuition&quot; (despite most of them taking few or no classes). This &quot;tuition&quot; is either paid by an outside research agency, or &quot;generously&quot; waived in exchange for the grad student doing teaching and grading, again at very low wages.",1436313252

They are able to do so because they make a profession out of it: they have a lot of capital to work with, and they spend a lot of time thinking about it.<p>To call finance intentionally opaque is a perhaps true, but it shouldn&#x27;t be vilified much more than other goods and services,   the providers which all maintain some level of &quot;opacity&quot; towards their customers.  In a sense, it&#x27;s a fundamental part of any capitalistic transaction.  A farmer sells an apple for more than it costs for her to make it, but you&#x27;re willing to pay her for it because you aren&#x27;t that good at growing apples.  To her, it might be worth what it cost her to grow it, but to you, it is clearly worth what you are willing to pay for it, because you have the added benefit (or requirement) of being able to eat it and survive.  So it is worth more to you, less to her, and she profits.<p>One could see similarities in insurance (much closer to finance than apple-growing, if not finance itself).  An insurer charges you (or maybe an aggregated group of &quot;yous&quot;) more than it costs to provide a certain protection (or hedge against a certain risk).  You are willing to pay the premium because clearly the risk protection matters more than getting some &quot;theoretically optimal&quot; price.<p>With increased availability in technology and information, certain kinds of finance are becoming easy to do &quot;on your own&quot; - the most salient example is perhaps index investing.

9848904,comment,9847706,9847706,0,0,anonu,,,"This is called the &quot;index rebalancing&quot; trading strategy. Prop desks and hedge funds have known about it for decades. A lot of money is passively benchmarked to many popular indices provided by the likes of S&P, DJ, Nasdaq, etc... One reason people invest in funds that track these indices is because they believe the index provider is a good benchmark for whatever its tracking. For example, the S&P 500 tracks the 500 largest US names. The Nasdaq 100 tracks the 100 biggest (mostly tech-related) names that are Nasdaq-listed. etc... In addition to being a good benchmark, a set of rules (here are S&Ps: <a href=""https://us.spindices.com/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://us.spindices.com/documents/methodologies/methodology...</a>) are published by the index provider that govern how stocks are added and removed to the index. Understanding these rules allows arbitrageurs (aka market-makers) to predict when names are moving before they are announced by the index provider. Since a fair amount of capital is already tracking these indices, the passive indexer will be required to buy/sell the names in the index in the right proportion so as to be properly benchmarked.<p>Another interesting point is that the Volcker Rule has more or less caused a massive shift of this type of strategy away from US investment banks and into hedge funds. I don&#x27;t have real data on this - just my observations.",1436312666

The index has ETFs tracking it that are large enough to exhaust the availability of liquidity in both MSFT and APPL during a quick rebalance.  Eventually over time the liquidity arrives to correct the mispricing, valuing things based again on underlying fundamentals.  Both the index and the shareholders of the ETFs take a hit as the price of MSFT rises (no longer part of the index) and APPL (part of the index) lowers back down to normal, assuming no changes in fundamentals in the meantime.<p>The ETFs can be smart about it and try and make the trades over time instead of all at once, and Vanguard likely does.

Continuous views can be further aggregated and queried like regular tables too.<p>In terms of not requiring that raw data be stored, a typical setup is to keep raw data somewhere cheap (like S3) so that it&#x27;s there when you need it. But granular data is often overwhelmingly cold and never looked at again so it may not always be necessary to store it all in an interactively queryable datastore.<p>As I mentioned, PipelineDB certainly doesn&#x27;t aim to be a monolithic replacement for all adjacent data processing technologies, but there are areas where it can definitely introduce significant efficiency.",1436312306

Not only is #5 not a particularly strong position, but the point I&#x27;m making is that statements that people have consensus about don&#x27;t necessarily make advice that creates effective results.<p>Number 5/30 is around the top 15%. Consensus is not required for effective results. I never claimed such a thing, so why is this your point? Consensus is required for morality. Because morality is subjective it is impossible to conclude whether something is truly moral or immoral. Two people with different morals will have incongruent notions on good and evil. Thus for a concrete answer we turn to majority consensus. This is the entire reason why I brought it up. In short, consensus verifies that my advice is effectively moral.<p>>You are so tunneled into the idea that betrayal is bad, that you are missing how the business is an entirely different entity. There are employees, customers, and investors all potentially affected by this outcome. In the case of a breakup, there is potentially a greater moral obligation to create the best result for the other parties, than just fixate on the betrayal of the victim.<p>I am tunneled into the idea that betrayal is bad. It usually is, and this case does not deviate from the usual scenario. The business IS a different entity with separate moral obligations. These obligations are may intersect and be in conflict but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m addressing. I&#x27;m addressing the betrayal not the complexities of life. These things are a given and it will be the OPs choice whether he wants to be moral to his friends, business partners or both. I apologize for not having the time to write a 200 page essay about the details on how he should handle every single separate moral obligation that could potentially be compromised by such a large decision.<p>>Not to mention your idea of this requiring moral punishment is not something that would draw consensus on HN, or in general. That is your fantasy, not reality.<p>When did I say he <i>requires</i> moral punishment. I&#x27;m suggesting a moral action. The consensus and I repeat again is not on some stupid requirement. People voted me up because they agree with the morality of the suggestion. If he takes my suggestion, the action will be moral in the eyes of majority consensus.

To justify the cost of an actively managed fund, a manager has to not just beat the market, but trounce it. Very, very few can do so for any length of time, and they know it, which is why articles trying to convince people of the virtue of active fund management are constantly written.

So you would expect them to be able to do better than the actual index (until you add in all the other management costs/trading costs).<p>To an extent the amount the ETFs are effective at this lowers the amount the index underperforms, because they (the etfs) are themselves the driver of the liquidity crisis the index is getting subject to. So you would expect some sort of equilibrium, and the claim is therefore to be taken that this equilibrium settles down at of 20+ basis points.",1436310987

So, PipelineDB eliminates ETL batch processing by incrementally inserting data into continuous views, but the documentation says that it&#x27;s not meant for ad-hoc data warehouses as the raw data is discarded. So, does that leave me still using batch processes to load my data warehouse? Is PipelineDB going to be my data warehouse as long as I only want the resulting streamed data?

9848703,comment,9843654,9847677,0,0,dlss,,,"I&#x27;m super confused by this reply. The article says that the stddev of the distribution of male IQ is larger than the stddev of the distribution for female IQ, and also seems to state the mean and median are equal. GGP threw out 60/40 as their believed split of men to women being good engineers. I took this to mean that GGP was saying he believed engineering talent to be independent of gender when IQ was present, and that engineering required a higher than average IQ. More formally:<p><pre><code>  P(good engineer | IQ) * P(IQ | gender) == P(good engineer | gender)
</code></pre>
In that model the 60/40 split comes from a conditional distribution of gender given an IQ above some threshold. So something like:<p><pre><code>  julia> women = sum([randn() > 1 for i=1:10_000_000])
  julia> men = sum([(randn() * 2) > 1 for i=1:10_000_000])
  julia> women / (women + men)
  0.3395449535000696
</code></pre>
Which isn&#x27;t exactly 60/40, but is fairly close. It says that [iff the 60/40 split is true], the stddev difference needed is less than 2x.<p>If you prefer exact math, the ratio above is<p><pre><code>  erfc(1/sqrt(2)) / (erfc(1 / (2 * sqrt(2))) + erfc(1 / sqrt(2))) =~ 0.339593
</code></pre>
and the exact solution for a 60/40 split is<p><pre><code>  1 / (sqrt(2) * inverseerfc((3/2) * erfc(1/sqrt(2)))) =~ 1.4
</code></pre>
Though FWIW I find the simulation version more intuitive (likely because of a misspent youth programming rather than a misspent youth mathing :p).<p>Can you explain the model you were using to motivate the mean vs median calculation? I feel like I&#x27;m missing something interesting.",1436310096

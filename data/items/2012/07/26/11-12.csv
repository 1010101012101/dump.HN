4295434,comment,4295104,4295104,12,0,adrianhon,,,"When it comes to games, originality is a crucial factor that's frequently overlooked. It's difficult for indie devs to compete against licensed properties (e.g. Temple Run: Brave) or against freemium games that can throw a lot of money on user acquisition. Creating truly original or interesting games is one way to compete against them. Unfortunately, the typical reaction is to just do a spin on high grossing casual games (e.g. Fruit Ninja) leading to a price war and generally low revenues.<p>When we made our running game, Zombies, Run!, we had absolutely no interest in competing with the freemium or 99c games - we don't have the properties or resources to do that. Instead, we made a game that straddles the fitness, gaming, and storytelling genres. We also charged $7.99, making it the most expensive game in the Top 200 Grossing today (even more expensive than Minecraft).<p>Part of the reason why we can do this is because we basically have no competitors - although obviously that made it a little harder to educate the market. I'm sure we will get competition, but the skills required to make the game (iOS dev, web dev, award-winning author, voice actors, sound producers, community support) are not trivial to find and organise.<p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, people <i>will</i> pay for an app that they think is original and worthwhile, and not just on iOS but Android as well (we're very happy with our Android sales).",1343301829

I use a music library app in which I can decide which way my music is ordered. Albums from oldest to youngest? No problem. Artists alphabetically? Sure thing. Artists alphabetically and their albums in chronological order? No problem.<p>The music library app is especially tuned for ways to view my music that make sense for music. It makes those easily accessible. The file system is wholly inadequate for that task.<p>The library app takes care of the underlying folder structure  but thats an implementation detail I absolutely do not care about. I dont even know how it looks. (I just looked it up, its Artist  Album, the same structure I used before I started using a library app.)<p>Im not sure that the file system is really so bad (at least Im relatively comfortable with it) but I do think that for certain specialized tasks its massively preferable to have dedicated apps.

4295378,comment,4294911,4294911,1,0,b1daly,,,"Apple's attempts at making ""seamless"" user experiences can be frustrating, especially on edge cases. For example, in Garageband instruments are stored in special files down a ways in a directory tree in Application Support. It happens that files get corrupted, but access to the file is so abstracted that the source of the trouble is not apparent, as it is a directory not intended to be accessed by the user. It's an attempt to hide complexity from the user but it makes it hard to trouble-shoot, or to perform actions outside of the expected.<p>The area that does boggle my mind in terms of a flat structure are complex multi-media authoring environments. Where different files and types are used to assemble a larger work.<p>My main principle as an audio engineer is that I have to know exactly where each file in the project lives in the FS. If I'm not sure, the scenarios in which projects, or parts of projects get lost happen more frequently.<p>Not to mention that a given project uses many files of different types, and can have 10s or 100s of thousands of files. Automatic file management seems like a recipe for disaster, especially as it won't work perfectly.<p>I don't get it.",1343300437

7372228,comment,7371848,7371848,21,0,not_paul_graham,,,"Whenever big money is at play, there are bound to be players that will try to influence the market on either side of the trade, so I&#x27;m not sure why the NYT reporters are being so one sided in their coverage. One of the other big players on the other side of this trade is Carl Icahn (who owns nearly 15% of the stock) so there is pretty much equal influence if not more to negate whatever Bill Ackman can do. Other investors on the other side of Ackman include George Soros as well as William Stiritz, the CEO of Post Holdings, maker of Raisin Bran.<p>What I would like to add though is that Bill Ackman is extremely thorough before going all out on a bet of such proportions. If he wasn&#x27;t he wouldn&#x27;t be in the business any longer than average Joe. Bill Ackman has acknowledged losing $400 million to $500 million on his short position, and I really don&#x27;t think he is stupid enough to want to lose more money just to stroke his ego.<p>Here is one thing that the author states in the article:<p><i>Mr. Ackman once made a similar bet against the bond insurer MBIA, one that reaped him and his investors a $1.1 billion return. In a book about his MBIA wager called âConfidence Game,â the reporter-turned-financial analyst Christine S. Richard chronicled how he fought with regulators for SEVEN YEARS before his prediction that MBIA stock would âspiral downwardâ came true.</i><p>What this fails to take into state is that if the regulators had been more diligent in following up, they could have helped reign in the massive toxic CDO empire that companies like MBIA enabled that nearly tanked the global economy a couple of years ago. Also MBIA did everything it could to malign Ackman&#x27;s reputation. He was under investigation for more than a couple of years where he tried to convince the &quot;rating agencies&quot; Moodys, Fitch and the like and the regulators about all that was wrong with MBIA and other such companies. Confidence Game is a good book worth reading to understand how dumb the regulators and rating agencies can be.<p>So ultimately Ackman probably knows more about this than the reporter or the regulators because he binges on tons of information and is pissed that no one is doing anything about it. Similarly to what happened with MBIA. I&#x27;d say that he is going to this extent because he is beyond frustrated that others can&#x27;t see what he can see and he is trying to get others to do the research, and do what is right. He has stated that he will stick to this as long as it takes and so if there is an investigation, and they (Herbalife) come out clean, it&#x27;d still be a losing bet for Ackman as he is mainly concentrating his $$ into this trade.<p>If I had to put my money, I&#x27;d put it with Ackman, unfortunately I&#x27;m still grappling with my student debt to be able to afford making these kinds of bets.<p>In the grand scheme of things, I think Bill Ackman is more like David than Goliath. Sure he has a couple of billion in the bank, but investors like him are why corporate executives aren&#x27;t partying like they used to in the 50s/60s/70s/80s and are becoming more accountable to shareholders (albeit very slowly).<p>I&#x27;d go so far as to say that if Paul Graham was in the business of funding hedge fund managers, Ackman would be one of his top picks from the applicant pool.<p>Also to add more context:<p>Ackman outspent by Herbalife in lobbying battle [1]<p><i>Hedge fund manager William Ackman, who is betting $1.16 billion that Herbalife is a fraud, spent $264,000 last year on lobbyists to press his case against the company, according to government documents filed in recent weeks.<p>THAT AMOUNT IS DWARFED BY THE NEARLY $2 million Herbalife spent in 2013 on federal lobbying as the nutrition and weight loss company fought the billionaire investor&#x27;s claims it runs a pyramid scheme. In an illegal pyramid scheme members earn more for recruiting new members into the scheme than for selling the products outside the network.</i><p>And Ackman isn&#x27;t alone in thinking that Herbalife is a pyramid scheme [2].<p>Disclaimer: This is my opinion, and as such all I know about Ackman is from the press, reading his report/book called &quot;Is MBIA Triple A?&quot;, the book mentioned in the article &quot;Confidence Game&quot;, his talks/interviews/tv reports and second hand articles on the web.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/09/us-herbalife-idUSBREA280OH20140309"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/09/us-herbalife-idUSB...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalife#Pyramid_scheme_allegations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalife#Pyramid_scheme_allega...</a>",1394448261

7372223,comment,7371806,7371806,4,0,tenfingers,,,"&quot;-Winit-self&quot; actually disables the common &quot;var x = x&quot; idiom which is used to silence &quot;uninitialized variable&quot; warnings.<p>Personally I consider &quot;-Werror&quot; stupid. Warnings are designed to help and be reviewed, but aiming at &quot;100% warning free&quot; code should not be an &quot;aim&quot;. For instance, I&#x27;d rather have &quot;unitialized warnings&quot; than use &quot;i = i&quot;, which you know, might actually be correct code if &quot;i&quot; was available in scope and you want an additional copy that you can modify (nester for loops come to mind).<p>I sometimes leave warnings when silencing them &quot;uglifies&quot; the code.<p>&quot;-fvisibility=hidden&quot; is not so easy to leave on all the time when building software build by others. What I use is mostly &quot;-fvisibility-inlines-hidden&quot; in C++ code, even when building OSS projects, for which I never had a problem so far (in c++ inlines _are_ expected to have hidden visibility).<p>I also use &quot;-march=native -flto=jobserver&quot; and &quot;-fwhole-program&quot; (when linking) when I&#x27;m targetting my own hardware.<p>I also noticed that gcc now supports &quot;-Og&quot; to build optimized programs without impact on debugging, for which I had a very long command line before. &quot;-Og -g3&quot; gives pretty decent performance and optimal debugging, which is ideal for beta-testing programs.<p>gcc supports a pretty infinite list of command line switches. Actually, if you know what you are doing, you can optimize a program so well it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to beat even by hand-crafting assembly. I know I tried several times, before realizing I could move a function to a separate object and supply a different set of optimization flags tuned just for that function.<p>For instance, &quot;-Ofast&quot; is actually safe most of the time for system utilities (and most other OSS software), and gives quite a boost for programs working with floats (most image-resizing loops and the like). Very few programs actually rely on exact IEEE arithmetic. Though I never use it, since finding issues might be _very_ hard.",1394448247

7372208,comment,7371478,7372168,1,0,Evgeny,,,"My workouts are recently down to 30-40 minutes. Even less on a fasting day :). I have an advantage that the company has a gym, though, so there&#x27;s no extra trip. My workouts are a combination of weight exercises (big 3: squat, bench press, deadlift + occasional cleans), bodyweight exercises (mostly along the lines of &quot;Convict conditioning&quot; books 1 and 2, and some stretching. Today, for example, in about 40 min I did (plus some stretching)<p>Barbell Squats 3 sets of 5<p>Pull-ups 3 sets of 9<p>Stand-to stand bridge 3 sets of 2<p>A static exercise on abs - 2x60s<p>The &quot;secret&quot; is that I move between exercises and sets with very little rest, I.e. do squats, then do pull ups, then back to squats - while the leg muscles get some rest, the back and arms do the work and vice versa. Of course, you need some aerobic fitness for that so you don&#x27;t run out of breath. I know 2-3 hours are not unheard of, but, unless one plans to compete as a bodybuilder, diminishing returns kick in pretty fast. Even worse, one can overtrain and extra time will be very counterproductive in this case.<p>Of course, if you are, for example, a competitive powerlifter (I did that for a few years), you should train in a very different way - i.e. only do one exercise at a time, and have longer breaks between set etc., but if your goal is primarily health you may be way more flexible in your approach.<p>Another example - once a week I run home from work. It&#x27;s 10 km, so takes about an hour. However, a bus takes at least 40 min, sometimes a bit more. So - I spend only 20 extra minutes, but I get a full hour of exercise!

An interesting approach!<p>Did you also consider using some more advanced geometry representation of terrain other than heightfields, such as triangulated irregular networks? That would allow you to choose an error threshold for each LOD and seamlessly join neighboring patches together without the need to use vertex shaders for it.<p>I did my own &quot;Google Earth&quot;-alike using a modified BDAM algorithm a couple of years ago. It required Hadoop preprocessing of detailed input data (resolution in meters), parallel terrain simplification using quadric error metrics and edge collapses and produced a set of layers at different LODs.<p>The cool thing about it was that you could have chosen the desired screen-space error and fetch only those LODs that were fitting - usually these had far smaller size than regular heightfields of the same resoultion/error. You could have also incorporated roads, rivers, buildings, bridges, tunnels straight into your terrain geometry, as well as different textures for each sub-part of it.<p>The tessellation was a bit funky (BDAM uses triangular patches instead of tiles) however there are also variants that utilize rectangular tiles. Vertex shader was then used to simulate 64-bit precision, giving uniform rendering detail in centimeters for the whole Solar system. Geometry shader could add more detail into it and overall it was very snappy online as the size of downloaded data was smaller than with regular meshes.",1394447473

7372137,comment,7371246,7371404,2,0,mcv,,,"> In games like Clash of Clans, etc... You can play without paying. But it is just depressing to have an opponent attack you, where you can tell that they have effectively bought their way in. They didn&#x27;t spend the time to effectively build their city, wait for their upgrades, etc... instead, they just bought a ton of gems and used that to make their city.<p>I don&#x27;t really see the problem there. It&#x27;s no different from players who simply got in earlier and got a head start. Games where some people join later are unavoidably going to have these kind of inequalities. To me, it doesn&#x27;t matter if someone is stronger because he played longer, or because he bought his way in.<p>But if he bought his way in, he&#x27;s probably less experienced than his strength suggests, and I might be able to defeat him despite his theoretical strength.<p>And MtG is far more evil in this regard. That one rare card in every pack is exactly meant to drive addiction, and get people to pay one more pack hoping for the rare card they want. In a way, MtG pioneered the pay-to-win game play, and plenty of people resent it for that reason. Though, in its defense, Magic&#x27;s success may have been an accident; they may not have been intentionally taking advantage of addiction, and many of these modern mobile game companies definitely are.<p>But the main difference is that in the end, Magic is fun. If you just play opponents with a similarly limited collection, playing with less cards may actually be more fun than having everything. But many of these mobile games are intentionally designed to be less fun, to have lots of micromanagement and tedium with very little actual game underneath, and you can pay to skip the boring game play.",1394446267

But it doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t want to learn at all.<p>To be more specific, if Emacs would have more familiar keybindings for Windows/Mac users I probably use it.

So Emacs and Vim developers did what they did. But why should I spend so many time in learning all these oldschool workarounds?<p>Yes, I want terminal-based editor. But the rest of the killer features of Emacs or Vim are not so unique these days. I can obtain near the same level of functionality and flexibility in any modern window-based editor such as Sublime Text or IntelliJ Idea. Currently I&#x27;m using this one as my primary code editor - just for text, not for Java. And I find that it has even wider range of handy code manipulation commands than Emacs provides.<p>So, returning to my question. I would prefer to choose terminal-based code editor. And it is ok if it will be differ from the editors that I use - I&#x27;m ready to spend time in learning new stuff. But I&#x27;m not ready to learn code editor completely from scratch.

7384467,comment,7378865,7382232,2,0,ksk,,,">And that is echoed in various other economic comment in later years. So there is an uncomfortable lack of research.<p>Seriously? You use the words &quot;almost certainly&quot; and are now trying to weasel out when simply asked to back up your statement? The correct response when you don&#x27;t have data is to say - I don&#x27;t know at the moment.<p>>So given both that model and the lack of evidence, to say an increase in availability of goods, with a still strong level of production, is a good thing, seems very reasonable, does it not?<p>Lack of evidence is just proof of lack of evidence. You don&#x27;t get to make any wild assertions because they sound reasonable in your head. And even if you do, you have to qualify them with the appropriate words - you don&#x27;t get to say &quot;almost certainly&quot;.<p>>What does that even mean? Really, what?<p>Perform my thought experiment.<p>> If people buy more coffee machines and make coffee at home, perhaps coffee-shop owners are going to say they are losing &#x27;potential income&#x27;. Oh no! we had better ban the use of coffee-making machines!<p>Thats a rather childish way of twisting my argument. It has nothing to do with the topic at hand and does not deserve a response.<p>>The law is not there to ensure certain businesses make as much money as they think they should. (Well, sadly it currently is, but it ought not to be.)<p>If you don&#x27;t like the law, get it changed. What have you done in that regard?<p>--<p>There is a solution for your problem that doesn&#x27;t involve breaking laws just because you don&#x27;t like them.<p>1) Support artists who put out their work in non-copyrighted form. Perhaps they could have a new model like kickstarter for music/movies/games with people pledging money.<p>2) Help reduce piracy of copyrighted material and get people to support above artists.<p>3) The vastly increased sales of those artists will attract even more artists to that model creating a nice feedback loop.<p>4) Copyrighted forms of entertainment will diminish in their importance and the MPAA/RIAA could perhaps cease to exist.",1394611016

There is a difference between the tinfoil hat approach of just envisioning things evil organizations/governments might do and assuming an intelligence gathering agency is gathering as much information as it can.<p>The more I think about it, your argument is so bad I wish I didn&#x27;t even waste the time responding.

In that way words like debt/debit form semantic clusters (as in the structure of Arabic) even though the former has a silent &#x27;b&#x27;.  It makes the prosaic language more poetic.<p>Of course French elevated this spelling conservativism to a fetish, proving that you can go to far.<p>But I find it sad that languages like German that reform their spelling to make it more phonetic saw away the history and meaning from the words and force you to memorise, rather than deduce, meanings.  Likewise teaching English reading via &quot;phonics&quot; ignores the interconnection of the words and makes spelling harder rather than easier.",1394609485

In everyday life, people assume an idea is true until proven false. This explains the widespread belief in the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot, UFOs, and God. But to a scientist, the central precept is called the &quot;null hypothesis&quot;, which essentially says that an idea is assumed to be false until evidence supports it -- the opposite of the ordinary outlook.<p>This means:<p>1. A new idea is assumed to be false, and<p>2. The burden of evidence rests with those who introduce a new idea.<p>More here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell&#x27;s_teapot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell&#x27;s_teapot</a><p>> The burden of proof lies with anyone trying to make a hypothesis<p>Yes, but in your next phrase, you get it entirely wrong.<p>> ... and the author of the article is hypothesizing and claiming results without method or control.<p>No, the author is placing the burden of evidence where it belongs -- with the originators of the ADHD idea.<p>To go into this a bit more deeply, the reason for the current system of evidence responsibility is because the originator of an idea must provide positive proof, but if the rules were as you suggest, the idea&#x27;s critics (like the author of the linked article) would have to <i>prove a negative</i>, which in most cases is an impossible evidentiary burden.<p>The impossibility of proving a negative explains why so may ignorant people believe in ideas in the Bigfoot class -- things that cannot possibly be proven not to exist.

If you&#x27;re in a safe position (which you should be throughout almost all of the game) then your possible gains from a great move are zero; if you don&#x27;t take some advantage this turn then you&#x27;ll generally get it next turn; but a single bad move can put you in an unfixable position.<p>There are almost no opportunities to make a &#x27;great&#x27; move - since a great move with a significantly better effect on chance of winning than a move which doesn&#x27;t change anything at all - is possible only if the move fixes a huge earlier mistake that you wouldn&#x27;t have made in the first place.<p>For this particular game, advantages are temporary and disadvantages are near-permanent - so it makes sense to play very defensively, which minmax does. Imagine a game of Die or Coin, where if you choose coin, then you get $10 for heads, and $20 for tails; and for dice you throw a hundred-side die and get $25 for values 2-100 but if you roll 1, then you get shot and die.<p>[edit] what I&#x27;m saying is that assuming that [a] all payoffs are either effectively 0 or -infinity; and [b] most moves will (in the near expected future) be either 0 chance of the bad event or >0 chance of the bad event; then minmax would generate equal results to MC search - however, MC search would fail badly if you put overly optimistic payoffs, i.e., give too large rewards for &#x27;good moves&#x27; and too little penalties for bad moves; and this is hard to estimate.<p>Minmax works if your payoff scale is completely wrong by orders of magnitude as long as the preference ordering is correct, MC search doesn&#x27;t. If you know that position A is better than B but don&#x27;t know if it is 1.1 times better or a million times better - then you can&#x27;t implement a good MC search but can implemnt minmax.",1394607983

Don&#x27;t go pre-&quot;optimizing&quot; by adding a bunch of needless network calls—you&#x27;ll only end up with more instability if done naively. DO start from the beginning with clear interfaces and boundaries between concerns in your codebase. Design for services from day one. If you don&#x27;t have discipline not to tightly couple objects together, split into multiple codebases (gems, modules, whatever) tested in isolation that can be deployed together until it&#x27;s time to pull them apart.<p>A well designed class interface can be turned into an HTTP (or socket) API easily enough. By the time you need to, you&#x27;ll probably have the resources to monitor, scale and maintain the additional service properly.",1394607687

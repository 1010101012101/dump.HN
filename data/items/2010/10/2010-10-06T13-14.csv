On the other hand, I have not needed a third-party repository with FreeBSD yet, so I have no basis for comparison.<p>> scripting it is an exercise in frustration<p>Strange.  I've scripted half a dozen different things for working with ports, because it was so easy to do, then subsequently found out that someone else had not only already done the same thing but done it better and committed it to ports.  Your experience is obviously much different from mine.<p>> packaging for ports is easy but leaves me with feelings of horrible guilt because of the complete and utter lack of regard for the sanity of the end user<p>What's so insane about its (lack of) regard for the end user?

I suspect they would disagree with your assessment.<p>> you can't query ports for the actual state of the filesystem vs. what it <i>thinks</i> the state of the filesystem is because it simply doesn't know<p>Example, or clearer explanation, please.<p>> since ports doesn't support third party repositories in any reasonable fashion it doesn't matter, since you can't use the native package management on FreeBSD to distribute your applications anyway<p>I find this difficult to believe, but what the hell -- I haven't bothered looking into it.  I'll just accept what you say for argument's sake, for now.<p>> Sorry for the angry rant, but my level of disgust at seeing ports held up as an example of something good about FreeBSD is impossible to contain.<p>That's obvious.

Previously although I work in a technology field, I was pretty functional. That is, my knowledge of coding began and ended at SQL and HTML. But on the same note, years of doing custom applications with developer teams educated me on the 'lingo' and what could and could not be done (at least, not easily).<p>Over the past year, we had many 'business' persons who offered to help out, and while that was awesome, what we really needed was qualified technical people. For a 'business' person, one can usually get an unpaid college intern and not have to sacrifice any shares in the company.<p>Also, I think as functional person you are somewhat ""over the barrel"" if your developers dont perform, and can do nothing except complain. I do believe it's better overall if you can build your own product. 
At the end of the day, we decided to educate our own team in Ruby/Rails rather than bring in outside developers.  I think this was a smart decision, and also a more cost effective solution.<p>I definitely suggest other start ups do the same.",1286371395

If an American stopped the line for anything, they would be fired. So cars rolled down the line with fatal defects, needing either expensive repairs or a trip to the trash heap. On the other hand, Japanese workers were encouraged to stop the line for any flaws they saw. This limited the loss to individual parts and components, rather than entire automobiles. This sounds like Apple's 10->3->1 approach: design flaws are discarded as soon as possible.<p>The piece also asserted that GM failed to adopt these measures for two reasons: upper management deferred to individual plant managers for the practices to be used in each factory, and the plant managers preferred the don't-stop-the-line approach, since they already knew it.

employees are banned from using GPLv3 software. E.g. if you report a
bug to them that requires checking out a newer version of GCC they'll
just shrug and say ""sorry, but we can't try it out"".<p>Oh, and the diagnostics are much better, and not just because they're
in color. Consider e.g. this program:<p><pre><code>    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        printf(""hello %d"", ""world"");
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
GCC will give you:<p><pre><code>    hello.c: In function ‘main’:
    hello.c:5: warning: format ‘%d’ expects type ‘int’, but argument 2 has type ‘char *’
</code></pre>
While clang gives you:<p><pre><code>    hello.c:5:20: warning: conversion specifies type 'int' but the argument has type 'char *' [-Wformat]
        printf(""hello %d"", ""world"");
                      ~^   ~~~~~~~
</code></pre>
Clang tells you not only the line that had the error but also the
column, then it higlights the %d format argument, and shows you which
argument you gave doesn't fit with it.<p>Pretty much all of its diagnostics messages are like that. While you
sometimes have to stare at code for 5-10 seconds to see what GCC is
complaining about clang will tell you exactly what the problem is.",1286370844

If you're around very successful people these notions are lofty.<p>Sure it's possible to bang out a program in an afternoon. I used to do it. My coworker does it all the time. But I am not doing it now so there must be something very wrong. Maybe I'm too old or depressed or have ADD or ...<p>I found you just have to really step out of your head for a second. My managers are genuinely happy with my progress even if its slow. They know they can count on me to understand the problem and keep advancing and deliver something that works, even if that takes weeks where it could theoretically be done in an afternoon.<p>Furthermore, they want me to be relaxed and happy and that means it's fine to play hooky or slack off some days.<p>So I just focus on my personal relationship with my coworkers, and my mental health, not my ""productivity.""

We do OWN the internet, because it is us who create the Internet.

Ok, fine, do it, moron. The only problem is – once you do something as stupid as this you scare all the people AWAY from your domains, making them literally worthless.

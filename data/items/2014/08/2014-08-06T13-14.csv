Stuff can and does still break between deployments, as external dependencies change, load increases or it&#x27;s characteristics change, &quot;time bomb&quot; bugs go off, or any of a huge number of other things happen. Infrequent deployments mean that responding to these events is slower and more costly.<p>Infrequent deployments also greatly increase the risk of problems during deployment, because infrequently exercised pieces of code (i.e. The deployment code/scripts) are more likely to be buggy, and because gobs of changes pile up between deployments.<p>With that said, continuous deployment probably should not be happening at night or on the weekends unless you have rock-solid automatic rollback and the necessary monitoring to trigger it.",1407333505

My company has just submitted into beta what we believe is the easiest to use, and most ridiculously friendly referral marketing app in the SHopify app store. We call it Forewards.\nWe&#x27;re currently looking for beta testers to help us iron out any kinks before we release fully. We&#x27;ve already had a number of our own services clients using the app for a few weeks now and the feedback has bee great so far.<p>Our objective was simple. Focus on simplicity, ease of use and friendly UI. We looked at the Shopify ecosystem and felt that in the marketing app segment and specifically with the referral apps already on the market it seemed like everyone was focusing on features, vs user experience. So we went the opposite route.<p>Along with our eternal gratitude we&#x27;ll also extend a full year free subscription to the first 25 beta testers.<p>You can find the app here https://apps.shopify.com/forewards or learn more about it here http://forewardsapp.com/",1407332748

Self-issued certificates are trivial to produce, and in the era of mandatory TLS they probably should not produce the huge scary browser warnings we see today. I&#x27;m not a UI expert, but I could envision a &quot;medium severity&quot; browser warning that states the connection is encrypted but the certificate can&#x27;t be verified. I don&#x27;t see the logic behind abandoning encryption entirely rather than tolerate some level of self-signed certificates.<p>> Limited choices.<p>Arguably the whole CA system is in need of serious reform. This is orthogonal to HTTP/2 and TLS.<p>> Encrypted browsing is simply unnecessary for certain classes of sites (non-logon, informational sites).<p>I could not disagree more. Encryption is--from an efficiency standpoint--literally just some bit-twiddling (after key exchange). The efficiency cost is trivial, the social benefits are enormous. It&#x27;s very much worth it.<p>> It increases the barrier for entry to put a basic website up.<p>This is one advantage of baking it into the protocol. If the HTTP/2 implementation takes care of the details of encryption (including certificate generation if necessary), website authors don&#x27;t need to be concerned with it. Everything will just work.<p>> Internal network communication becomes a lot harder with self-signed certificates.<p>As stated above, certificates are not barriers. If your network is &quot;trusted&quot;, then why would you care if the certificates are self-signed? You are arguing instead to not use encryption at all! Do you see how backward this is?",1407331596

I think the main reason is that it&#x27;s easier to take risks for yourself where you&#x27;d be hesitant to exposing someone else to the same risk. And they do have a point.<p>People with bio/medical knowledge are probably able to recognize signs such as stomach problems and act accordingly, but they can&#x27;t really expect patients to. Aspirin messes up coagulation beyond belief. While that is a boon to some people, issuing a blanket blessing of the substance means <i>people will die</i> in emergency rooms and on operating tables, people who could have been saved if they weren&#x27;t on ASS. For most MDs, weighing that statistical certainty against a comparatively fuzzy list of preventive benefits which may or may not be favorable for some patients is not a hard decision to make. Hence the verdict: &quot;don&#x27;t use it, even though I myself do use it&quot;.<p>Again, accepting this for yourself can be an informed decision, but it&#x27;s not one you want to make on behalf of the general population.<p>In my case, it&#x27;s similar.

Every script run happens in its own sandbox on our machines. We use docker, it&#x27;s awesome. People are asking for dedicated machines specifically for their company, and others are asking to hook into their own machines. Once we figure out how people/companies want to use the site, we&#x27;ll put up some options for where code will be run. I&#x27;m totally open to feedback and would love to hear what you think.<p>I&#x27;m measuring costs right now. But I&#x27;m seeing that when we get a fair pricing model up - if you could hit these api&#x27;s only when you need them, rather than have a dedicated server for them, you&#x27;d save a money. A really different way of looking at PaaS + Apis... and I&#x27;m super excited about it. Right now, I&#x27;m just trying to collect as much awesome feedback as possible for use cases, and then we&#x27;ll have a better idea for how users would want to be charged. Right now, people are asking for a simple request-based model. Would love your thoughts on this as well.<p>Thanks again for the questions. You&#x27;re awesome.<p>paul@blockspring.com\n312.834.7265",1406699889

With great power comes great responsibility.<p>- The Go 1 compatibility guarantee does not extend to C code.<p>- C functions cannot be inlined.<p>- Escape analysis cannot follow values passed into C functions.<p>- Code coverage does not extend to C functions.<p>- The C compilers (5c, 6c, 8c) are not as optimised as their companion Go compilers, you may find that the code generated is not as efficient as the same code in Go.<p>- You are writing plan 9 style C code, which is a rough analogue of C89.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://dave.cheney.net/2013/09/07/how-to-include-c-code-in-your-go-package"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dave.cheney.net/2013/09/07/how-to-include-c-code-in-y...</a>",1406699344

Unfortunately, bicycle helmets are almost definitely useless at this speed.[1]<p>It&#x27;s also unclear if the same mechanisms for brain injury apply, though I don&#x27;t have any statistics on this matter. My impression is that strict blunt force trauma is no longer the prevalent mechanism for injury in cars---you&#x27;re more likely to get whiplash or some sort of quick rotation that puts you in a coma due to the brain sloshing around. Helmet or no helmet, it&#x27;s difficult to protect against rotational modes.<p>So even if we went with this article&#x27;s suggestion of wearing helmets in cars, there&#x27;s a large possibility the numbers wouldn&#x27;t look any better.

Nothing about car statistics invalidates this trade.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.helmets.org/limits.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.helmets.org/limits.htm</a>",1406698535

8106573,comment,8104365,8106101,1,0,alok-g,,,"Wow!  I totally did not know this.  Just went through a few Wikipedia articles too.<p>A question I have is what would happen if I cut down carbohydrates, but not increase fat either!  I discovered through accidental self-experimentation that cutting down on sugar is helping me, while my diet barely included rice, potatoes, etc. anyways.  I used to consume some pasta, but will reduce that too now.<p>What is the purpose behind increasing fat in diet when doing this?  Is it to just compensate for calorie loss?  Is it to control cravings?  One one hand, it is saying that ketogenic diet will help burn body fat, and on the second it says go increase fat consumption!<p>I&#x27;ll need to do some research to understand how to get carbohydrates to just 20-25 grams per day like you have mentioned.  A &quot;Pure Protein&quot; bar I just consumed by itself had 17g!  Would it work out if I can get to within 50g of carbs (which is still much lower than 300g you mention for an average American), together with cut down fat too?  Or that defeats the whole purpose?!<p>Since I started cutting down on sugar drastically, I have noticed though my craving for sugar has increased (though I am still able to control).  Diet soda seems to be helping with these cravings significantly though I am not sure what are the side effects.  (I have come across many conflicting studies against soda, so have never been sure!)<p>I am moderately exercising too, gradually increasing.<p>Eggs seem to be recommended in these diets.  As someone with borderline cholesterol, would eggs still be recommended?<p>Thanks!",1406698395

8106566,comment,8106142,8106142,2,0,Theodores,,,"I have sold thousands of helmets in my time, they are an easy $$$ upsell with a new bicycle. The sale is simple, people even know the FUD and have heard all of the anecdotes. However, I don&#x27;t wear a helmet myself and, when I sell someone a helmet, there are a few things I do for them:<p>Sell them a hi-viz tabard or coat. These are cheap (tabard) or slightly more than an average helmet (coat). The thinking is prevention better than cure. If you can avoid the impact in the first place then that is a better place to be. Hi-viz works, there are studies from 3M and plenty of others to prove it (if you think 3M are biased). In real life I have been ticked off for not wearing a helmet by riders in black - you know the ones - male, black clothing, helmet, smart-arse attitude.<p>Make sure the helmet fits. There isn&#x27;t a lot of point being strangled by a blob of polystyrene foam. The straps have to be done up tight for the helmet to do what it is supposed to do. Generally I point customers away from the American brands - Giro, Bell - and towards the European brands because the straps are much better on the proper European brand helmets. They lie flat with the face and don&#x27;t have buckles that catch the skin. Again, the no-viz riders in black protected by their magic helmets rarely do the straps up and you can flip the helmet up off their heads with a single finger.<p>Sell trouser clips and sensible footwear. In the UK leisure cyclists need to be aware that a denim trouser caught in the chain (or a shoelace) will throw you straight over the bars head first onto the road. Trouser clips (and stiff-soled cycle-specific shoes) prevent that from happening.<p>Sell lights that work. The front light is probably more important than the back. Just a basic flasher will do. Drivers are used to seeing idiot cyclists on the road in front of them riding without lights, they are easy enough to pick up with headlights. However, overtaking drivers do not expect some cyclist coming the other way. So lights are vital particularly during the spring/autumn/winter months.<p>For me, with interactions with customers, the helmet is also part of a use scenario. Mountain biking? Doing back-flips on a BMX? Road-racing? Small child on trailer? We actually have specialist and different helmets for those scenarios. Same for people returning to cycling from having not been on a bike for a while, we have affordable and easy to adjust helmets for those folk too.<p>My message is that cycle safety isn&#x27;t just about wearing a helmet. Wearing a helmet does not make you safe any more than an airbag makes a motorist safe. True safety is to be found elsewhere, by being properly visible to all other road users and in riding a bike that isn&#x27;t going to self destruct due to some unanticipated interaction with clothing. It is also in having the skills to ride a bike in a way that is neither cowardly or cocky.<p>If you ride the same route every day and know every pot hole, recognise the plates on the cars that pass you every day and have never had the slightest chance of a mishap you do have to think &#x27;why am I carrying this block of polystyrene with me every day? Am I doing this just to please my car-driving mother?&#x27;<p>Finally if made-in-China polystyrene was that great they would make the fronts of trucks from the stuff.",1406698215

The problem, weighing yourself once a week is open to random fluctuations.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m trying to gain 15 lbs this year. That&#x27;s 0.28 lbs per week, or 1.25 lbs per month. My weight might go up and down a couple of pounds throughout the day, depending on the amount of water in my system, when I use the washroom, etc.<p>So, I weigh myself today, and let&#x27;s say I had a little extra water in my system. Now, I weigh myself in a month, and I&#x27;m slightly dehydrated that day without realizing it. I might have reached my goal and gained 1.25 lbs that month, but the scale is showing I weigh 1 lbs less than when I started.<p>That&#x27;s a problem, because I stuck to my goals, my routine, and I get slapped in the face with results that say I&#x27;m going in the opposite direction. I might incorrectly make changes to my calorie count, that don&#x27;t need to be made.<p>This is why tracking is useful. You step on the scale on a regular basis, and you can see the overall trend over time.

8106507,comment,8103240,8104622,2,0,chatmasta,,,"Yeah, same. The first time I ever heard &quot;Markov chains&quot; was when I was a 13-year-old hanging out on black hat SEO forums. Back in the day, software like &quot;YASG&quot; (or something like that, &quot;yet another site generator&quot;) made a lot of money with simple PHP scripts for rewriting Wikipedia articles with Markov chains, thus skirting Google&#x27;s duplicate content algorithms, which were much weaker at the time.<p>There were actually quite a few vulnerabilities back then. I wrote a script that allowed me to create a Google account with the IP address of a visitor to the website, all without them knowing. All I had to do was open the registration page with a server side script, download the CAPTCHA, display it to the user and ask them to fill it out. When they filled it out, the submitted form targeted the Google registration form in a 1x1 iFrame, then another button targeted the logout form. Google was not checking the referrer of the sign up form, nor was it comparing the IP address that received the CAPTCHA to the one that submitted it.<p>I had a friend load that script into thousands of generated blogspot blogs, which got long tail google traffic and asked the user to &quot;fill the CAPTCHA to continue.&quot; The script ran for ~2 weeks and generated ~60000 Google accounts all from unique IP addresses.<p>That was around 2007, so obviously it&#x27;s all patched up by now. I was 15 years old and never did anything with the accounts, so if anyone from google is reading this, keep the lawyers away from me please.<p>Blackhat SEO actually has a lot of clever tricks. I haven&#x27;t been part of that space in a while, for a lot of reasons, but I can attribute 99% of my knowledge of marketing to time spent trawling through blackhat SEO forums reading not my about that, but also landing page optimization, conversion tracking, copywriting, etc. It was definitely a worthwhile learning experience for me.<p>Oops that veered off topic.

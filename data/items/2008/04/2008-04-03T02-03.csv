Possibly because I really don't expect to get in, with the badness=YES field this time.  (My cofounder quit last week.)  I figure it can't hurt to try, but really I've just gotta keep hacking until I have something people want, and then it doesn't really matter whether we're funded by YC or not.",1207191598

153574,comment,153487,153534,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I switched mostly because of the large collection of apps (= plugins, in other framework terminology) available for Django.  The admin app gets most of the attention, but it's way more than that.  For example, there's an app for built-in CSRF protecion.  There's one for a comment system on any type of object, and another one for threaded comments.  Generic tagging and voting apps.  Instantly generated RSS (yeah, I know Pylons has this too, but it's built into the framework and not a 3rd-party add-on) or Sitemaps.  There's an OpenID plugin.  A way to automatically generate robots.txt files.  A couple different forums, and a blog.  (This is huge: in past projects, one of my biggest frustrations has been getting 3rd-party forums to interoperate with the site's custom authentication scheme.  Django lets you use one user model for all components.)<p><a href=""http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoResources#Djangoapplicationcomponents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoResources#Djangoapp...</a><p>Some other things I liked about it: I thought that Django views were conceptually cleaner than Pylons controllers, with fewer global variables needed.  I thought the templating language looked cleaner than Mako as well, though less powerful.  The admin app saves me lots of time for mundane tasks that I'd probably just forgo otherwise.  I could get used to the ORM - don't particularly like it, but as ORMs go, it's quite nice.  I really like that it comes with authentication, sessions & user models built-in.  I liked that it was well-documented.<p>Some things I thought Pylons did better: I think Pylons packaging & deployment is much more mature, built on setuptools, Paste, and eggs.  I like that I don't have to use an ORM, and that it's loosely coupled in general.  I like how Mako lets me define template functions directly in the template.<p>Also, Guido blessed Django as ""the"" Python web framework at SciPy 2006.  So far, the rest of the world has basically ignored that pronouncement, and I haven't really heard anything further about it.  But I thought that it was generally more prudent to be on the same wavelength as the BDFL.",1207190477

He planned to use an idustrial glue and designs which required gluing on both sides. He devised a technique where he could batch 10 kites in the time it would take to make two kites sequentially.<p>Likewise, on a train, I overheard two jewellers discussing one of their mutual acquaintances. Apparently, the fellow discovered a lucrative sector of the market (US$900 white gold bracelets). He was making them in batches of 50. He would warm his soldering iron and repeat the same step 50 times. Then he'd repeat the next step 50 times. He didn't care the first few bracelets were bad or if he'd make a mistake because he'd still have 45 or so perfect examples when he finished. Its boring but its very productive.",1207189234
153552,comment,153437,153437,0,0,brent,,,"I'm not a real math guy, but I believe you solve these with a technique called asymptotic iteration.  So for sufficiently large k you can assign an initial guess at x (which I label x0).  Then plug that into the original and repeat:<p>x = k * ln x<p>for large k (and x):<p>x0 = k<p>x1 = k * ln k             (plugging in x0 in for x)<p>x2 = k * ln (k * ln k)    (plugging in x1 for x, etc...)<p>x3 = k * ln (k * ln (k * ln k))<p>x4 = k * ln (k * ln (k * ln (k * ln k)))<p>x5 = k * ln (k * ln (k * ln (k * ln (k * ln k))))<p>As this technique is asymptotic you can determine the error as it decreases with each iteration (usually just denoted as a big O of some small function).  I tried this with k = 30 and the values of x I calculated were:
30, 102.03, 138.75, 147.98, 149.91, 150.30 respectively.  To double check... 150.30/ln(150.30) = 29.9845.<p>Hope this helps.",1207189116

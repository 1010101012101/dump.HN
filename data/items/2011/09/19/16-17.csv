Additionally, in order to legally sell this stuff in the EU, you need to get a WEEE certificate (i.e. someone needs to take care of recycling or disposing of your product) and a CE certificate (compliance to all regulations). \nAnd you cannot easily fix a bug in your board design or even the firmware, once the product has been shipped to the customer. You have to get it right on the first try.<p>I agree that it has become relatively easy to start a hardware company. However, compared to a software startup, you need to invest a lot of money upfront. And so much more can go wrong that you have little control over.<p>I don't know a lot about startup economics but I have closely followed the fates of a number of hardware startups. For example, the Pandora guys got screwed over by different manufacturers, costing them a lot of time, money, and goodwill. WakeMate shipped dangerously defective USB chargers they had to replace. OpenMoko just did not find enough potential buyers for their phones (and screwed up in other ways).<p>Hardware startups do not fail because of a lack of prototyping tools.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.sparkfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkfun.com/</a>",1316451537

3014237,comment,3012519,3013588,1,0,akg0,,,"> One answer is to say ""they wouldn't!"". From there, you have to ask: would they still create? Probably, yes, but in a much more limited way.<p>We're <i>already</i> limited by IP. The proposition of IP is that the best way to encourage people to engage in creative works is to prohibit them from engaging in creative works that involve other people's creative works.<p>That seems ridiculous at face value to me. That's not to say I think it's universally false - reality is often annoyingly counter-intuitive that way - but it only makes sense when there's a dearth of people able and willing to engage in creative pursuits, or when disseminating ideas and works is prohibitively expensive. Both of those conditions may have been true a century or even arguably two decades ago - but not today.<p>It does bring babies and bathwater to mind, though. In the name of encouraging creativity, we prohibit particular forms of creativity.<p>It'd be one thing if we had good reason to think that it continues to have its intended effect - but we don't. On the other hand, we have <i>lots</i> of examples of unintended, negative effects that inevitably come with trying to impedance-match a reality full of cheap technology that can quickly spread information with a system that attempts to limit access ""for your own good"".<p>> It seems fairly logical to me that without IP, you'd have fewer ""IP goods"",<p>True. Strictly speaking, I don't think there would be any ""IP goods"" per se, just technological goods. But I think most businesses wouldn't be affected much at all - I could see, for example, a software vendor like Oracle continuing to do almost exactly what it does today, indefinitely, even in the absence of IP. Well, sans a bunch of lawsuits.<p>(Not to get OT, but inevitably someone's gonna ask ""what stops their customers from buying 1 license and deploying on 10,000 servers?"" Nothing, or maybe some sort of DRM - but that's not the point. Ultimately, access to updates would be Oracle's ""teeth"" for discouraging that behavior among their customers. So they'd fire a good subset of the legal department, and instead hire more developers to write new features in order to retain customers. Sounds like more resources allocated to creative, productive work to me.)<p>> although having actual numbers to plug in, somehow, would doubtless improve the discussion a great deal.<p>This is the biggie. IP has been around much longer than the transistor, and given the enormous potential upsides, it seems obvious to me that we should have gone on an IP 'sabbatical' maybe 10 years ago, just to see what happens. After all, it's <i>entirely</i> possible that the overall creative output of our society wouldn't be affected at all, leaving ""just"" the advantage of ridding ourselves of one more legal labyrinth.<p>But the best case is much more exciting - what if creative output rises dramatically? I certainly don't think we can rule it out without giving it a shot.<p>And sure, there's a worst-case too; maybe every job related to IP simply disappears and we end up with a generation of college grads with no jobs. Fine, it can be undone. I'm not morally opposed to IP - well, I guess I do find it distasteful - but I'm definitely morally opposed to wrecking the economy. No one's suggesting we just say ""screw the baby"" if it turns out IP is a good thing.<p>But right now, we just don't know, and <i>we should find out</i>. On balance, it's <i>absolutely</i> worth trying - so why haven't we done it already? Not that I'm actually asking, we all know that there's a long and dreary list of mundane political and human-nature reasons why it hasn't happened, and won't be happening anytime soon.<p>But so it goes.",1316450759

The only reason Greeks get away with it is, I think, because nobody takes the Greek gods seriously anymore (or at least no one is worried about too many people doing so, and causing trouble in the name of Zeus!)<p>So no King Solomon, no Vedas and probably no Confucius either, as secular as he tended to be.<p>You mentioned at the end of the article that""...philosophy was hopelessly intermingled with religion. It didn't shake itself free till a couple hundred years ago...""  I'd have to counter that philosophy without religion is generally new, hollow and unworthy of much study -- which in some ways I think is your point.<p>I'm genuinely curious: Why (or if) you think that this decoupling is a good thing?  So few other disciplines (only  Religious Studies, and perhaps The Arts) ever touch upon the idea of spirit at all -- which I think is at the core of Philosophy -- the nexus of Sapience and Sentience.  If one is not a fan of religion on principle (its over-adherence to both dogma, and dominance are two criticisms that I have), then certainly this is a <i>strength</i> of Philosophy -- the decoupling of religion from matters of the spirit/soul.  Spinoza's The Ethics; and Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil are two interesting books for students of Philosophy to consider.",1316450289

It's incredibly unlikely that PC Magazine is risking the FTC going after it by publishing something paid for by AT&T without disclosing it. Frankly, that was an unjustified attack to discredit without providing a compelling counter-argument or other evidence.<p>Moreover, 40Mbps isn't unrealistic on an empty network for an absolute maximum. Average speeds of 22Mbps seem realistic given Verizon's 16Mbps performance and the fact that Verizon probably has a couple million customers on its LTE network. Likewise, Verizon's absolute maximum is 50% more than their average speed. On an empty network, I'd expect more divergence in speed from average to maximum making AT&T's ~85% difference believable. Likewise, if you visit wireless forums, you'll find plenty of Verizon users posting their maximum rates over LTE and seeing similar speeds.<p>And these tests were being done using Speedtest.net run by Ookla and endorsed by the FCC. While I don't know the specifics of how it works, it is the standard in testing broadband speed. Without evidence that it can be tampered with, I'd listen to the FCC.<p>The real question is how AT&T and Verizon's networks will hold up as more customers come on board. Last quarter, Verizon sold only 1.2M LTE devices. AT&T has just started selling LTE devices. We might see the speeds of both networks lowered as the number of customers on the networks increases.<p>Many people dislike AT&T. PC Magazine is testing an unloaded AT&T LTE network and a mostly unloaded Verizon LTE network. These numbers seem very reasonable given those conditions. It doesn't mean that AT&T will remain at these speeds or remain ""better"" than Verizon (if your purpose is to defend a cherished carrier). It's simply an initial test of an unloaded network that shows promise for the network. Whether that promise will be realized or not we'll have to wait and see.",1316449980

Learning to sniff out the bad recruiters from good is a pretty essential skill in this business. I have really good relationships with a handful of recruiters I met this way that are experienced, professional, genuinely interested in my career and not interested in mismatching. Yeah, I had to get burned a couple of times, and yes I've had to learn to filter out the cattle call, code monkey staff aug stuff. And it's great.<p>Once you learn to filter and know the good recruiters from bad (tone of voice in the first 30 seconds usually gives it away) you'll find that in the 10% non-crap calls are usually lurking some good opportunities.<p>Flip this around to the recruiter's perspective. 99% of their candidates and contacts are crap as well. If you actually know what you're doing and have a decent resume, there's a significant percentage of these recruiters who will be thrilled to find you and may actually have some interesting work, if not now, down the line. This has happened for me on a number of occasions.<p>If you want to avoid annoyances, by all means avoid the job boards.

Finally after years of having to deal with the publishing, music and movie cartels;  writers, bands and indie movie producers can reach the world without having permission to do so.  However somehow we (software devs) have gotten into a position where we are beholden to 3 companies (Apple, Google & Microsoft) if we want widespread access to a mainstream audience.  For that privilege we have to pay 30% for these companies to host a few megabytes of program files and they tell us that its breaking even.

Another crucial clue is the complete familiarity of one character's name.  I can't say more without spoiling.<p>Really great fiction leverages the reader's powers of construction and imagination.  Stephenson gives indicators of the world he's describing and leaves the reader to construct it while he gets on with other matters.  If nothing else it's a better use of bandwidth.  Ayn Rand lays it all out, does anyone seriously enjoy reading that?  The reader's participation in construction gives them an ultimately better grasp of his idea, and a better foundation to think through the implications.  Better yet, it opens the possibility of imagining worlds consistent with the plot but different from the author's imagination.<p>The downside is those readers who haven't time to figure it out, or miss the clues.  Or maybe miss some of the background reading, which provides templates for a lot of what Stephenson's getting at.  There is a lot of philosophy embedded in the book, if you aren't acquainted with it you're moving without some crucial maps.<p>So no, the style isn't ""self-indulgent"".  It's a tool for communicating and working with some really complicated ideas.  I'm sorry you didn't like the book, but you could just say you don't get it without assuming the author is just showing off?",1316448632

This is something that we are really passionate about.<p>The one thing that has really held back the broad adoption of AMQP is the delay behind the release of the 1.0 version of the protocol. Now that we have this under our belt we need implementers such as RabbitMQ, StormMQ, Microsoft, INETCO etc to add support for AMQP 1.0. Finally, we need native AMQP clients installed by default and widely supported by OS and hardware developers, put simply, we need the full participation of the main operating system stack suppliers such as Microsoft and Redhat.<p>Luckily enough, both RedHat and Microsoft are members of the AMQP Working Group. I assume that they will release native clients and thus pave the way for broad adoption. It is the growth of pervasive AMQP clients and a strong and healthy developer community that will drive adoption and general acceptance of AMQP.",1316448587

Netflix has had to accept some pretty bad terms from studios, like delaying their availability of new releases, in part because studios see Netflix as a long-term threat. Quickster, on the other hand, should be able to build better relationships with studios precisely because they're not a threat to the studios' long-term dominance.<p>Basically, it's true that this is not the most customer-friendly move in the short-term, but the movie studios' strategy in the medium-term was to kill Netflix. ""Continue to grow in the same direction"" was not an option because the studios hated it, and this way both pieces of Netflix have at least a chance to survive.",1316448285

2265777,comment,2265444,2265678,0,0,lwhi,,,"I don't think Photoshop has ever been a good application for creating website mock-ups.<p>There are a lot of custom applications that have been created specifically for the job - from simple apps like Mockingbird, and Balsamiq; to more advanced applications like Visio and OmniGraffle.  I think these applications are best for carrying out the grunt-work involved in UI design.<p>I think the process of creating HTML mockups adds a layer of complexity that isn't necessary in the initial stages.  Being able to concentrate on the purpose of design (rather than implementation) is liberating.<p>However, I think there are times when a client needs to be able to visualise a potential aethetic near the beginning of a project.<p>Perhaps Photoshop has a place here - because a basic wireframe produced in one of the former apps often requires too great a leap of imagination to effectively communicate the intended result.  However - I think, a lot of the time, a vector package like Illustrator (or Xara or Inkscape) allows greater freedom (on the part of the designer) and makes the process of modifying a design less cumbersome.",1298735875

The money spent on technology alone is probably larger than the combined national budgets of those countries. Of course this will produce more noticeable results, but that doesn't mean that they don't contribute to innovation.",1298732549

Basically, it is asking:  If a civilization had access to the resources to create a technology, why didn't they?<p>Take perspective, or drawing things so that they look real.  Closer things are bigger, further things smaller.  Until it was invented around the Renaisance (1400/1500), all art was flat and kinda clumpy.  Why couldn't people draw nice things until then?<p>That's what new technology is.  A profound change in how we use resources.",1298732544

And perhaps that is because there are emotional reasons people accept religion and stick with it.  And they think it works both ways.  Deciding abstract question using logical criteria seems foreign to them.",1298732521

Making the developer release available through the Mac Store makes a lot of sense - it lets Apple reduce the physical packaging and posting costs and given that it's for developers, shouldn't be a problem for them.<p>I would like to add that I bought Windows 7 online from Microsoft and downloaded it, so Apple's hardly doing something new here - MSDN has had similar downloads for years.<p>The disc isn't dead, it's not even sleeping - most people will still want to burn their downloaded copy of a final release OS to disc for reinstall media.",1298732515

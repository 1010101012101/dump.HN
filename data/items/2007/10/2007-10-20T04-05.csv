I started Gmail when it was in beta and now I see why they did it, this article goes into why they do it.  Maybe Microsoft could take some cues.",1192856188

70631,comment,70453,70615,0,0,brl,,,"I think you're really making a lot of pretty backwards assumptions about the kind of people who would still move to the bay area if they weren't accepted into YC.<p>My startup has 6 people who all quit their jobs more than a year ago and have been working for free full-time since then.  We have bet everything on our idea and we're running out of time and money but unfortunately where we're located the kind of investors who are progressive enough to appreciate what we are doing just simply don't exist.<p>Long before we even knew YC existed we had already planned to move to SV to search for funding and launch in early-mid 2008.  We have a fairly extensive network of people who can help us there.  Really, it would be insane for us to try to raise capital anywhere else.<p>If YC had been in Boston this cycle we wouldn't have even applied.

Renting is back to the dot boom craze levels.

Average monthly rents in the region's financial and high-tech hubs have jumped more than 10 percent in the last year, and occupancy rates hover around 95 percent, according to a quarterly rental survey by RealFacts.<p>The average rent for an apartment in San Francisco stood at $2,243 in the third quarter, up nearly 12 percent from one year ago; in San Jose, the average rent also jumped 12 percent to $1,622, said RealFacts of Novato, which tracks rents in mostly large buildings across the nation.<p>....
A few years ago, after the dot-com implosion, landlords welcomed pets if it meant filling a vacant apartment. But Fougner, in his mid-30s, said online apartment searches turn up few that allow pets. Even then, he said, prices are usually at the very high end of his range - around $2,500.<p>Meanwhile, he has stopped going to open houses; even when Fougner would show up 15 minutes early, he found five or six people waiting.<p>""We might just end up getting a spot for $2,400 or $2,500 (a month), which will just make me sick every month writing that check,"" Fougner said. ""But if it's not a dump and has a patio, then we'll want to stay home more anyway.""",1192853578

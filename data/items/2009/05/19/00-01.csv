It's the only course I had in high school where we took doing experiments (and writing them up) seriously. Geology and psychology were purely lecture-based, and physics and biology were rooted more in demonstrations (because of a lack of resources, I suppose) than student participation. Chemistry teachers, therefore, are the most likely people in a high school to think in a rational, investigatory mindset.",1242694764

616009,comment,614310,614310,0,0,etherael,,,"I used to have a pretty normal desktop setup, the one thing that was the constant catalyst which finally pushed me over the edge to ""fix stuff"" was my uncomfy series of chairs (read: all of them, any chair under 500$ I've ever tried, for extended periods of seating is absolutely not something I am capable of effortlessly maintaining concentration during).<p>At first I thought, it's been over ten years you've been at this game clearly you're going to be at it for a long time more, why don't you just spring for a very expensive chair and get it over and done with? Well, I wasn't entirely certain that an Aeron or Leap or Freedom would actually fix my issues. Sure, people talk about them, but I wanted to <i>know</i> for sure that it would be the end of my problems once I had gone and fixed everything up, and the only way I could know that would be to actually buy one. Seemed like too much of a gamble so I skipped that.<p>It seemed strange to me that all these chairs at the high end were more than I'd spend on a new midrange system altogether, so I started to think about the entire problem rather than just the chair aspect and came to the conclusion that a nice recliner is probably about the most comfortable chair I've ever had, so why not work a system around that? I ran into several examples in the DIY sphere of people doing exactly this and being rave review happy with the results, as well as examples of high end full solution workstation setups like the Zero-Gee one and a few others based around the same idea that I based my initial plans on.<p>Interestingly enough, a good recliner will run you less than half the cost of an aeron, but seeing as I just wanted to prototype a setup I thought well what can I use that I have just lying around the house to make it happen? I had a broken chair (high backed / gas lift / 5 roller castors setup) and an old flat bottomed entertainment unit, so I ripped apart the chair and took the gas lift part of it and drilled and bolted it to the bottom of the flat bottomed entertainment unit, this resulted in kind of a mobile trolley with enough desk space for my display items (24"" widescreen, 15"" acer aspire 5630 notebook, 17"" 4:3 1280x1024 for the mini) with stowage space underneath the main desk for all the necessary driving hardware (mac mini + powerboards + cables + USB 3.5 SATA docking stations, speakers).<p>Having the entire setup on an easily movable / swivelling caddy means that it actually ended up serving as an entertainment unit for the household too, XBMC + 1080p 24"" = happy housemates when it's time to kickback and relax, I just swivel the caddy 180 degrees and then it faces 2 large sofas in the living room. Or I can move the caddy in front of a larger couch for collaborative sessions with clients and colleagues. Synergy links all the systems together, the mortals can use OS X on the mini and I have my heavily customised multi workspace ubuntu compiz system on the laptop, and I can take over their session w / synergy.<p>When working solo I face the caddy toward my single seat comfy old sofa and pull it in and equation complete, extremely comfortable working environment, enormously productive and adaptable, all in all extremely happy with it, and I'll be even happier when I invest a little more for an ergonomic recliner which will just be a dropin replacement for my current sofa. That said, this current one is so many more times comfortable than my old office chair + desk setup that I'm in absolutely no rush to do so.<p>Other potential ideas for upgrading are perhaps a kinesis evolution split keyboard setup mounted on the seat arms instead of the current lap mounted keyboard + right arm mounted mousepad setup, frictionless matting for the frequent different positions of the caddy, and an intuos to replace my sketchpad habit.",1242694079

615980,comment,615464,615464,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I found this interesting:<p><i>If our meeting isn’t going anywhere after ten minutes, you’ll notice a not so subtle shift as I move into ""shit, I’ve got five more minutes left -- I better get something out of this meeting.""</i><p>So, if the meeting isn't succeeding, he gets antsy and tries to make something out of it.  That seems reasonably admirable to me.<p>As for the advice, I wish it could be communicated and applied generally.  How many meetings have I sat through where the participants spent the prior hour or several browsing or socializing (open space environment)?  They get into the meeting, and the organizer spends 45 minutes of the hour lecturing to them about the topic.  If people had prepped, the meeting could be 15 minutes and end with an informed decision, instead of being prelude to a subsequent meeting wherein a decision may or may not be reached.  Meeting organizers play their part in this; all too often the agenda is mailed out 5 minutes before the meeting.  Like that's going to do any good.  It's CYA and does not serve any purpose of genuine communication.<p>I'm hesitating to post this, as my tone sounds somewhat negative.  But it's what I've observed, all too often.<p>I think it should be taken as a warning sign.  In the best groups I've worked in, people know what's going on and the meeting quickly moves on to what needs to be done, or to sharing genuinely novel information -- usually newly acquired and so not yet disseminated.  If you encounter a lot of the scenario described in the prior paragraph, start hunting for a new position.  Even if your current position is stable, it is likely to hold you back.",1242692087

If you need more than 16GiB ram, it makes a lot of sense to buy your own hardware and co-locate it.<p>Now, I disagree about keeping it in your basement, at least once you have users on it.  co-locating a 2 cpu box is going to cost you around $100/month, and you get much better connectivity than DSL at that price.     DSL isn't much cheaper, if you get a reasonable uplink speed (at least around here)  and I don't know about you, but the power in my house (I live in California)  isn't exactly /enterprise grade/.<p>But yeah, I see a largely untapped market for renting high-ram otherwise-cheap servers;  I've rented out one 32GiB server with a bunch of drives (and some slow CPUs)  to a guy for $1200 setup and $175/month...  once my next load of servers is up and built, I'm thinking about chasing that business model again, if I can build the servers faster than I get new vps signups, anyhow.",1242691396

I've heard of it self destructing (quite literally) midway through planing from these tensions.  It is possible to make furniture and other things from it, but the figure I remember is that somewhere between 70%-90% of the wood is unsuitable.<p>You can use them for turning sometimes, though.",1242691323

Thanks for the sagan quote, though, and the thoughts about euclid, ramanunjan, siddartha, bodhidharma, proudhon, and the vague admiration for people's names that i don't know, people who comprehended before there were equations, people who saw that all of life is emergent transformation, recognized not only introverted and extroverted states, but what people are today calling 'flow' and what some ended up calling 'zazen', and 3000 years ago they said was the third state, oh - and the fourth state, i supposed we don't have that here yet....but oh, still, love for arabic mathematicians and mayans obsessed with time.  before we get to 'greatest' the question arises, greatest at what?  if efficiency is the game, perhaps another read of brave new world and a reminder about The Ford is in order.  if ability is the game, perhaps we should smile again at oppenheimer yelling that he is shiva.  if the quality of human experience, the joy of living is the game, then is it really the internet, or is that just a medium through which we can share the real wealth?  i got my gitosis working, made me smile, gotta love the internet - was walking to my car when she smiled and made small talk, gotta love the internet, but true wealth is somewhere between wisdom and that girl's smile.",1242691203

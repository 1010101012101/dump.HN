I don't see a date, but the phrasing suggests he's discussing slides printed on transparencies, rather than PowerPoint/Keynote/etc.<p>To the author's credit, almost all of this advice is still relevant, but here's a nit: for academic work, if you have a series of steps to reveal to the audience, the ""peek-a-boo"" style is fine. It's only cheesy if you actually have to lay a piece of paper over the transparency and physically slide it down.

This is another thing which is lacking in Facebook. In fact it is something which is currently lacking from every social network (that I'm aware of at least). Everyone scrambling to build the next Facebook in the wake of the recent debacle may want to take some of these ideas.<p>For example, in your ""About Me"" section, with your co-workers you may want to say that you enjoy programming and playing around with server configuration whereas with your old college pals, you may want to say that you miss the days of binge drinking and getting laid. You would not want either group to see the other explanation of who ""you"" are.<p>Specifically related to this idea, you may want to have enable your college pals to see that you are attending ""Remembering the good ole days kegger reunion party"" while you may want your co-workers to see that you are attending a conference on some technology. You probably do not want them both to see the events that the other sees.<p>On a basic level, I like how Google Voice handles this. You can specify a certain voicemail message to be heard by people who are not in your phone book, and different voicemail messages for any groups you have created. This allows me to have a silly message played only for my friends and not worry that an important call will come in from an unknown number and get my silly message.

I've tried using it for document transformation purposes several times but never found a use where it wasn't easier to just write a DOM-manipulating script. As a templating system I don't see any advantages either - conceptually it's nice to force the separation of programming logic and templating functionality, but then again, you soon need similar constructs (if, loops, includes, ...) anyway and then you have to switch to xslt extension libraries... When it comes to templating, I still much prefer showing programmer constraint is a better way to go than technical barriers. That tradeoff may be different in a context where you have dozens of programmers/designers/content producers work on a site.

There have been probably hundreds of social networking sites that never failed to take off; this is, IMO, the key factor that separates them.

Obviously, for 90% of the web, that's just fine, but I do web apps that ""do things"".<p>For example, if I have a web app that converts numbers between bases (just an example, OK?), Google would ignore me, since my home page is just a couple of text fields and a submit button.  (If it's ajax, I don't even have a submit button)<p>So, I say, ""OK, fine, Google, you want text, I'll give you text"", and I add a blog, saying some stuff about converting numbers between bases.  That works a bit, but really, I don't have that much to say about converting numbers between bases.  I have this app, it works well, what's to say?  So, I rapidly run out of things to say in this blog I was forced to write.

Meaning, between my 250ish friends and I, I know more about the features and settings than they do.<p>1) Why would I leave my friends for a competitive product?<p>2) The UI/UX design of facebook is above industry standard. They're innovators in this space<p>3) Privacy is meaningless because normal people don't share provocative and sensitive information to begin with. So really, the privacy concerns some of you have is a non-issue with me and my friends.<p>4) Facebook with one sweep can completely change their privacy act and make everyone happy. See 4.<p>4) You can't make everyone happy. Of all people, <i>we</i> startup fanatics should know that. You won't make everyone happy with your competing product either.<p>5) Facebook should be your strategy for growing an alternative. Harvest information, learn from their doing. Copy and mimic every move, but improve on their downfalls. Because facebook is the best example of a functioning network, brand, and organization. Learn from it.<p>6) To have even the slightest chance of survival, you need to focus on a niche market first (fb for college students). This last step is going to the most difficult in todays environment with linkedin, facebook, yearbook, twiter etc.<p>Those are my thoughts for now.",1273342275

Take a look of how we're trying to deal with this problem (link in my profile, sick of being accused of spamming, sorry).",1206352564

That seems to work there, and (since this site is primarily about YC's aims and its potential founders) I'm sure serious entrepreneurs wouldn't think even <i>once</i> about paying.<p>Look at it this way: people will pay for the privilege of an intelligent conversation, but trolls feel so entitled that 99% of them will never pay.",1206352006

Of course, most DJs would rather just push play when they have live shows because it most take a lot of practice to master live looping. I saw Justice live recently and they were very good at pushing play.",1206351653

144446,comment,141898,141898,0,0,vicaya,,,"Not everyone is meant to be or want to be a startup founder either.<p>If you look at the history, most substantial technology innovations are not from startups but universities and research labs of large companies.<p>Startups are more about the right idea (in business sense), the right time and the right place than innovation and quality work. It's more like a monopoly game than truly substantial and creative technical challenges. It attracts more people who think they're good than they're actually good.<p>Been there, done that, got the t-shirts. For real hackers who're incited/excited by the article to be a ""founder"", here're a few notes based on real experience:<p>1. Many top hackers are not interested in and bored by the financial aspect of the business. But you have to learn the basics in order not to be taken advantage of. It's not that hard to crack once you decide to bite the bullet.<p>2. Pick your business partners carefully. Not just someone who's smart but someone you can trust. To use a cliche, it's a jungle out there, which I could only appreciate after experienced it the first-hand.<p>3. If you want to go through the Y route, talk to the previous founders (esp. not so successful ones). You learn the most from failures.<p>4. Make sure you understand and make copies of every thing you sign.<p>5. Beware of business people who boast photoshop chops.",1206351593

Come June, I will be quitting the FT job and focusing exclusively on the startup.<p>I have been working FT for a large company for the past 5 years (past year remotely from home) and am really excited for moving to full time on my startup.",1206351504

144443,comment,144105,144314,0,0,davidw,,,"I wasn't quite sure about posting it, but I thought the contrast between Carr and Arrington was interesting, and highlights a very important issue: what to do about intellectual property, and what the consequences are for various concerned groups.  It is a very sensationalist title though.  I guess it would have been better to change it to something like ""Carr vs Arrington on IP"".",1206351215

144441,comment,144390,144414,0,0,rms,,,"What do you mean by a proper trust metric? I see systems of karma on sites like these eventually evolving into reputational economies so I'm curious about any way of making karma more complex.",1206350804
144439,comment,144383,144436,0,0,boucher,,,"How can you take ""the environment in big companies is toxic to programmers."" and say ""Paul makes no claim about employees being unhappy [...] the absence of something you don’t even know you’re missing is hardly likely to make you unhappy on its own"" ?<p>I can see how someone might have difficulty making the connection, but I think the food analogy addresses it.  Most food that people eat is in fact <i>toxic</i> to humans.  However, its toxicity, on average, is fairly low; it is only in aggregate over an extended period of time that the consequences become apparent.  In some cases, it will never even cause a problem.<p>Eating this ""toxic"" food doesn't cause anyone unhappiness in the short term, it may even cause a great deal of happiness, but it can have long term consequences.",1206350026
144438,comment,144303,144394,0,0,cstejerean,,,"If you fail will you be happy with going back to your old life? Will you all of a sudden enjoy being in a ""cage""? What happens if you're only happy when working on startups and every single one of them fails? Will you be poor forever? What if your current startup succeeds? Will you stick with it as it becomes a large company or leave and try to recreate the startup environment you enjoyed so much? (it seems to me that YC might be a way for PG to relive his startup days, which is why he tries to reproduce the Viaweb model so closely).",1206349319

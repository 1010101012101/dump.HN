What if they use round-robin DNS and then need a failover procedure? What if round-robin DNS isn't balanced enough for them? What if logs files need to be merged? What if the web servers aren't 100% identical? Data needs to be sync'd? Load distributed more intelligently? Cron jobs modified? etc, etc.<p>Perhaps they kept things unusually clean and simple, but most sites require a little finagling when they go to multiple web servers. I'm not saying it's <i>difficult</i>, but I do think it's wise to expect a few bumps.",1179134018

Much more.<p>> I&#x27;m often struck by how many Lisp Machine features have been implemented on other systems (e.g. CLIM, versioned file systems) yet haven&#x27;t gained many users. There must be stories here.<p>Versioned file systems existed before and after Lisp Machines. For example DEC&#x27;s VMS had a versioned file system. CLIM was the attempt to develop a portable standardized version of the GUI library of Symbolics. It failed to gain real traction: too different, not very polished, everybody had already a different GUI toolkit, ...<p>Here is an example of using a high-end Lisp machine application for 3d graphics:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RSQ6gATnQU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RSQ6gATnQU</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VmJVNYfxDc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VmJVNYfxDc</a>",1402527566

Private schools don&#x27;t have tenure and cost on average about half as much per student as public schools do.<p>> <i>It is alot like the USPS. Even UPS and Fedex don&#x27;t want its unprofitable routes in rural areas because they can&#x27;t be made profitable. The problem is, when you rip away the profitable portion of the process, it ends up costing the taxpayer just as much when the bill comes due.</i><p>UPS and Fedex aren&#x27;t legally <i>allowed</i> to charge less than the post office does to deliver mail nor are they allowed to carry non-urgent mail or packages. The fact that they focus on high-priced delivery options is NOT because they&#x27;re cherrypicking, it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s the only niche they&#x27;ve been able to wrest legal access to. (And they were able to do <i>that</i> because the post office was at the time <i>losing money</i> on package delivery - it was only seen as a valuable market niche after Fedex showed that it could be done at a profit!)<p>Get rid of the laws prohibiting competition with the post office, let the post office go broke if need be, and the private carriers would make money in rural areas too. Mail delivery would likely cost half as much if the private sector did it.<p>Incidentally, it has long been the case that in some rural areas the Post Office would deliver mail to the nearest &quot;mail stop&quot; (which could be miles away from a home) while UPS and FedEx would drive right up to the door.<p>>If you want vouchers, you need to fund every child equally...including the fact they may live in the wrong neighborhood.

You actually share something when you stop having &quot;a whole&quot; and now you have &quot;a part&quot; but then someone else has &quot;a part&quot; as well. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve seen parent teach their kids over and over again. Sharing the ball: <i>we</i> both use it, share your candy <i>we</i> both enjoy it, even if it means I&#x27;ll have less.<p>With electronic articles and other media that gets shared, you actually share nothing in that sense, you just let someone know about it, whilst still keeping the whole yourself.<p>I know that semantically you can also &quot;share information&quot;, and you lose nothing by doing it. But my point is that maybe most people associate sharing with &quot;losing a bit to give to someone else&quot; instead of just &quot;letting know&quot;.<p>I am thinking hard and haven&#x27;t come up with a better word, I admit it, but maybe there is actually a better word for describing that &quot;electronic share&quot; action?<p>The bullhorn looks promising, but like someone said, it looks like an axe is too small. And also someone else said it would have to be different enough from a volume icon.<p>Maybe two hands apart, one with a piece of &quot;the whole&quot; and the other hand with the other piece?<p>In that regard I liked the Android icon a lot, even though it&#x27;s a bit too abstract. But it conveys the idea that you just multiplied the information, without losing anything yourself. Maybe a diagram of an &quot;information bus&quot; could work? like a straight horizontal line with a perpendicular line protuding from it, indicating that you keep going but still produced a new path/road/source?<p>Edit: added clarification",1402527113

The biggest difference was indeed utilization - the example given a couple of times was that as taxi drivers, they would drive someone to the airport and have to drive home empty, since they didn&#x27;t have the necessary licenses to work inside the airport and it wasn&#x27;t cost effective to hang around hoping for fares on city steets outside their own territory.

Accepting bitcoin as payment isn&#x27;t beneficial right now.  There&#x27;s no benefit for merchants, because it&#x27;s instantly converted back to traditional currency.  There&#x27;s no benefit for consumers, because consumers have to buy bitcoin in order to spend bitcoin, and buying bitcoin means consumers have to manage their own wallet or store their money in a third party service that can fail or steal their money at any time.<p>The singular benefit is the publicity your business gets by accepting bitcoin.  In other words, bitcoin is trendy.<p>This isn&#x27;t a dismissal of bitcoin.  History has shown that trends are a powerful force.  If it achieves a kind of critical mass, then that will open up other avenues for bitcoin to become useful.  But in the meantime, be assured that your gut instinct of &quot;there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any reason to accept bitcoin except publicity&quot; is spot on.<p>As an aside, I think these announcements won&#x27;t affect the fundamental price of bitcoin.  They&#x27;ll cause fluctuations, but not any long-term rise or fall.  The price of bitcoin is driven by speculation.  It always has been, and always will be.  The fundamental price at any given time is due to speculators with large amounts of bitcoin who place large buy orders in hopes of getting <i>other</i> speculators to place large buy orders, then they sell.  From a game theory point of view, if a bunch of gamblers all place large buy orders, the first gambler to sell stands to profit, and the other gamblers will lose out.  You can see the evidence of this at any time: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/SYHhSCv.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/SYHhSCv.png</a> ... A gambler buys a bunch of bitcoin, which causes other gamblers to buy a bunch of bitcoin, which lets the first gambler sell off their position and make out handsomely.<p>There&#x27;s no long-term speculation going on.  Or, if there is, then the long-term speculation is being done by a few dozen people with massive bitcoin holdings.  No one else&#x27;s speculation is a significant price mover.<p>It&#x27;s true that the market responds to announcements, but it&#x27;s not true that the market price is driven by announcements.  They just serve as a trigger for gamblers to initiate gambles.  Hence, I don&#x27;t think the fundamental price will shift very much; what shifts the price is when large players enter or exit the market, which happens much more rarely than announcements do.",1402526365

It can be configured to rebuild a document whenever any source file changes and refresh a viewer such as evince or xpdf, so you only have to save the .tex file in your editor to see the updated typeset version. I&#x27;ve used LaTeX for years and only discovered latexmk recently, but it has made the workflow much more pleasant.<p>I&#x27;ve always wished it were easier to define new environments with arbitrary syntax that gets passed to external programs for conversion to LaTeX code while LaTeX is running. A package called dot2texi has that ability for dot code snippets (i.e., AT&T graph visualization tools, dot etc.), and the dot2texi source code shows how to do it in general.<p>I agree with the comments that Tikz is an amazing package, and I didn&#x27;t realize until recently that it includes many state of the art graph layout algorithms that are as good or better than dot, with highly customizable features such as allowing the user to specify absolute positions of some of the nodes and letting the algorithm place the rest. It seems the whole section of the Tikz manual pertaining to automated graph drawing is omitted if it&#x27;s built on a system that doesn&#x27;t have LuaTeX installed, which is how I must have missed it.",1402525864

Sure, it doesn&#x27;t provide a kernel, but it&#x27;s a pretty complete* system that&#x27;s very reflective and open to modification.<p>Running a lisp userland: There are Common Lisp replacements for Emacs, CL window managers, and one or two Lisp Machine style GUI libraries (CLIM). However, most Lispers seem to be happy using other WMs and Emacs. Do the CL applications miss something that the Lisp Machine environment provided, or were the alternatives more compelling somehow?<p>Other Lisp Machines: The MIT CADR is open source and available online[1]. Lisp Machine articles seem to focus on Symbolics software, what is that the CADR lacks? rms allegedly reimplemented many Symbolics features on MIT Lisp machines.<p>I&#x27;m often struck by how many Lisp Machine features have been implemented on other systems (e.g. CLIM, versioned file systems) yet haven&#x27;t gained many users.

I believe this is due to insufficient care taken in writing to reflogs and packs when receiving.  (Reflogs are appended to, for example, while objects are first written to, fsync&#x27;ed, then renamed into place, so object writing is incrementally atomic, while everything else... not so much.)<p>Fossil uses SQLite3, but it doesn&#x27;t do what I want -- only git gives me the power of the index, rebase, and light-weight branches.  (OK, Mercurial has those too, but it&#x27;s too late and it sucks.  Sorry.)<p>Fossil does get several important things from using SQLite3:  SQL for history (do NOT underestimate this), extensibility (one file format, trivially extensible schema), well-tested ACID semantics support.  Oh, one more thing: using SQLite3 minimizes fsyncs per-transaction.  There&#x27;s probably more benefits, actually.<p>And ZFS?  Well, ZFS snapshots give you ACID.  If you have a persistent ZIL then fsync() gives you barriers (nice!).  But a) snapshots are slow by comparison to SQLite3 COMMITs, and b) you don&#x27;t get the benefit of SQL.<p>Oh: and not everyone can haz ZFS, but everyone can haz git.<p>Everyone also can has SQLite3.<p>My proposal: backend git&#x27;s I/O abstraction layer (which is pretty nice) with SQLite3.  And if you have ZFS, then always take a snapshot in a post-receive hook; destroy older snapshots later in a cronjob.<p>(As for zfs destroy, you really want the async zfs destroy feature, which IIRC not every implementation has!)",1402525800

For the last 20+ years it has been pretty obvious that inertial confinement is a way to go to build a working fusion device.<p>For fusion development where are 2 main factors in play:<p>1. in the second half of 199x it was decided that fusion plant produced electricity can&#x27;t be cheaper than the current then $0.04/kwh of coal electricity, thus focus on &quot;research&quot; (especially to support modelling instead of real testing of conventional nukes) not on &quot;development&quot; as energy source<p>2. non-proliferation.

Without all the fuss of gigantic multi-year enrichment programs of fissile materials.<p>Laser driven is an inertial confinement which is well resistable to miniaturization/weaponization due to its complexity and low efficiency [though even that may start to change slowly with semiconductor lasers]. That makes it fine for &quot;research&quot;, and there is no need for &quot;development&quot; due to the above mentioned factor #1.<p>Even 15 years ago it was obvious that somebody need to put DT target inside the wire spool of the Sandia Z-machine discharge target.

Some form of &quot;Bootstrap-ification&quot; or whatever that served primarily to hide things rather than to expose them -- both to me, a longstanding user, but also I suspect to a fair fraction of new users.<p>Checkout also was initially more opaque, although that seems to have been improved a bit since then.  (Among other things, the first time post-design, finding and renewing an associated &quot;WhoisGuard&quot; registration was a PITA game of hide-and-seek.)<p>I found the redesign to be yet one more example of what I consider to be the current, mistaken over-influence of &quot;Design&quot; and &quot;Designers&quot;.  Taking &quot;stuff that works&quot; and &quot;prettying it up&quot; while making it:  Harder to actually see; harder to actually use; more bug prone; less responsive (as opposed to &quot;responsive&quot;); etc.<p>There are plenty of good redesigns.  But there are plenty of &quot;redesigns for redesigns&#x27; sake&quot; that should be stopped before they are started.<p>The other day, I heard someone apply the Hippocratic Oath to an element of software/systems design, and I found myself agreeing:  &quot;First, do no harm.&quot;<p>In Namecheap&#x27;s case, I can understand the design to update a distinctly &quot;old school&quot; appearance.  But, as has been pointed out, the older design <i>worked</i>.  Keeping things working, and clear, should have been a primary -- first -- requirement of the redesign.  They didn&#x27;t fail entirely in that regard, but they certainly annoyed.<p>Also, the redesign did look more than a bit like someone &quot;slapped&quot; a Bootstrap theme or similar onto the site.  Maybe it looks better particularly on phones and tablets than the old site.  But I didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t find it particularly attractive.  If I&#x27;m going to devolve into discussing its &quot;Design&quot;, I think they could have done a fair amount better.<p>Anywho, the site is working, and on the rare occasion when I need customer support, they&#x27;ve always been very responsive via IM (integrated into the site).<p>Setting Namecheap aside, I hope that &quot;the Web&quot; in general, or at least the parts I care about, can get past this apparent outsized influence of... &quot;Design&quot; (/Craig-Ferguson-dramatic-expression-mode).<p>P.S.

My mentioning and questioning that, and referring to it as spin, is not at attempt at an ad hominem attack; it&#x27;s an attempt at a well-founded argument.<p>> I didn&#x27;t actually advocate a contributor agreement -- to the contrary, I cautioned against them.<p>You cautioned against copyright assignments (and thank you for that), but regarding contributor agreements you said (on slide 21) &quot;Corporate entities may (and indeed, should) have a contributor agreement ...&quot;<p>Have I missed something there?<p>> And indeed, the reason that this two-year-old presentation is on HN today is because today we did away with the node.js CLA[1]; we&#x27;re walking the talk here.<p>A change that&#x27;s deeply appreciated; thank you for doing that.<p>Regarding the licensing: I&#x27;m not going to quibble over <i>intent</i>, but intentional or not, it had the same effect.  The MPL and its various forks were well-known as GPL-incompatible licenses; that was not hard to predict, and people started talking about it right away.  Even if you had proprietary binary-only components, you could still use the GPL with an explicit exception, or alternatively any number of GPL-compatible FOSS licenses, rather than something GPL-incompatible.  You could also use a dual-license with GPL or LGPL, providing GPL compatibility along with any other license you might wish to use, as OO.o once did (dual LGPL/SISSL).<p>More importantly, it seems quite disingenuous to release software under a GPL-incompatible license and then complain that the <i>GPL</i> caused the problem and fragmented the community (&quot;Was it the intent of those who licensed their work under GPLv2...&quot;).  If nothing else, I&#x27;d suggest that we both should make fewer assumptions about intent, and talk about results instead.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m certainly not going to dispute that more new projects have arisen using non-copyleft licenses.  That hardly makes the GPL <i>obsolete</i>, nor does it invalidate the large number of existing GPLed projects.  More importantly, GPL <i>compatibility</i> remains critical; people choosing all-permissive licenses still tend to choose GPL-compatible ones, Apache being the most notable exception (and it still has GPLv3 compatibility).",1402525072

That doesn&#x27;t mean that we&#x27;ll use the vocabulary and mathematics of fundamental physics to explain brain processes, just as we don&#x27;t use particle physics vocabulary when we model Hurricanes or explain cell processes. Nevertheless, whatever model or explanation you come up with for Consciousness better square with those fundamental physics otherwise you&#x27;re going to be in the crackpot territory. That&#x27;s not Scientism, that&#x27;s just a fact.<p>>There&#x27;s this tendency to divide ideas into two camps: &quot;explained by our current understanding of physics&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;.<p>Again, Quantum Mechanics, and the Standard Model (as well as the laws of Chemistry that abstract those) are not going away. Evolution and Natural Selection is not going away either. That constrains the kinds of explanations we will have for Consciousness. If you think understanding Consciousness will overturn either the Standard Model or Evolution, you&#x27;re going to be very disappointed. Again, that&#x27;s not Scientism, that&#x27;s just a smart prediction.<p>>But telling me that Strong AI will basically solve this issue (and that any protestation is an appeal to &quot;magic&quot;) comes across as hand-waving<p>I didn&#x27;t say it will solve Conciousness. I think Conciousness is an ill-defined concept, but yet many people have very strong feelings about.

This may sound like a concession or even a defeat, but I think I&#x27;m allowed to posit that phenomena exist which we currently lack the empirical tools to investigate. &quot;Currently&quot; is the key word; as I said before, it is arrogant to assume consciousness will forever remain a mystery to scientific inquiry, just as it is arrogant to assume it must be a simple extension of existing theories.<p>I admit I have nothing beyond my own experience to validate the idea of subjective perception, and I have no evidence beyond intuition as to whether or not a machine can &quot;experience&quot; input the same way a brain can. However, I think I&#x27;m still entitled to believe that subjective experience is a real phenomena whose nature can and should be explained, and that our scientific understanding is presently inadequate for this task.<p>EDIT: I can understand the fear of relying on intuition. After all, it&#x27;s the same thing that led us to believe that lightning came from the gods. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that we should throw out the entire experience of perceiving lightning. Clearly lightning is a phenomena we experience, but we still don&#x27;t understand how photons entering our eyes produce the subjective experience of blinding whiteness, or how vibrations from thunder translated into electrical signals by the ear result in the subjective experience of the sound itself. The information is in the brain, but we still don&#x27;t know how information becomes experience. This doesn&#x27;t mean we have to explain it via gods, but it does mean we still have something left to explain.",1402524141

It&#x27;s impossible to make things without unwanted series/parallel resistances because conductors/insulators aren&#x27;t perfect. It&#x27;s impossible to make things without parasitic capacitance because without a perfect insulator, any two points have some capacitance between them - just like how there&#x27;s also a parasitic gas discharge tube if the electric field between terminals reaches the dielectric breakdown voltage of air (this is another two terminal device, it&#x27;s just not <i>linear</i>). These are all well-known physical phenomena that we deliberately assume away when we draw simple schematic symbols on paper, and then have to add back in when they end up applying.<p>Constraining the domain to two-terminal AND passive AND linear devices, one will have a very small number of possibilities for equations that describe them. Good old R/C/L that we know and love, and purportedly &quot;M&quot;. But what is <i>THE</i> physical process that M describes and therefore gets made interesting by?<p>One could create a battery-powered opamp circuit that had two external terminals and fulfilled whatever equation you dreamed up (once again up to the limit of your abstraction, in this case constrained to lower frequencies). But the existence of that equation/device doesn&#x27;t imply that there has to be a low-level physical phenomenon that will let you directly implement it.<p>Every time I try to read about memristors, I grok the bits in isolation, but mostly come away confused. C and L have state as well, and would also make great computer memory <i>but for those nasty parasitic effects</i>. From the wikipedia page: researchers everywhere are working on memristors, yet memristance was documented 200 years ago, yet the creator is arguing that the definition applies to phase change ram?

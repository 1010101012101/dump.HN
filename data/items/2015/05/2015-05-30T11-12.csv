First thing the only thing that kills cancer cells is Oxygen its the live giver, take in loads of oxygen, food that gives the maximum oxygen is Wheat grass juice ( you can get a shot at jamba juice) take it daily you will see phenomenal difference, remember Neil Armstrong has lung capacity twice that of normal people and he is completely cured of cancer naturally . Try pranayam its the best way to take maximum oxygen and increase your lung capacity and most important be positive !!!",1432987164

9629857,comment,9604333,9628737,0,0,jawnv6,,,"> Now that you know what I&#x27;m talking about,<p>You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about.  I worked on CPU design teams for 8 years of my professional career.  I&#x27;m telling you how they&#x27;re actually built and don&#x27;t need to use phrases like &quot;CPU takes its steps&quot; as if that&#x27;s meaningful.  Your conceptions about how CPUs are designed, how the design team actually reasons about what they&#x27;re building, is wrong.  It is not correct.  You have no evidence this is actually how those people think.<p>>  if you still insist on your point, and if you&#x27;d like to help me understand how I&#x27;m wrong, which I would appreciate, could you please show me how that live diagram would look like for a C program and its state, since as you say, C programs with its variables and the CPU with its registers are the same kind of &quot;stateful&quot;.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t venture near such a misguided statement.  The closest I&#x27;d come would be something along the lines of &quot;At the sequence points of a C program, parallels could be drawn to specific structures in the CPU responsible for tracking that state.&quot;  Note that those are meaningful words that someone could describe as &quot;wrong&quot; with an explanation, not groping in the dark for &quot;stateful&quot; to be stretched to cover both cases or whatever you were accusing me of doing/not doing.  But even then, the entire state of a C program at a sequence point might not co-exist temporally inside a CPU that nevertheless returns a correct result so it would take some more guard language.<p>> There&#x27;s a set number of registers and it never changes throughout execution.<p>This is a prime example where it&#x27;s really clear you haven&#x27;t considered a CPU architecture from the last decade or so.  There are a set number of architectural registers.  Inside the actual chip, because we&#x27;re considering a window of 40 uops instead of one macroinstruction at a time there are an indefinite number of dynamically assigned registers that may potentially hold the value of one architectural register.  Look up &quot;Register Renaming&quot; for yet another tables stakes CPU arch concept you&#x27;re blissfully unaware of.<p>This is probably going to keep happening.  You really don&#x27;t know enough about the subject matter to make correct or wrong statements.  As is, your statement isn&#x27;t precise enough to know if you were wrong about physical registers or right about abstracted architectural registers.  Note that being &quot;right&quot; about architectural registers means your argument is based on an abstraction instead of implementation.  And you really wanted to be talking about implementation.<p>> Please stop trying to talk about assembly. I know assembly. I&#x27;ve programmed Win32 assembly (you can make fun of me, it&#x27;s fine). I&#x27;m not talking about assembly here. I&#x27;m talking about the CPU designers or programmers and the guarantees they have when programming that we rarely do in HLLs.<p>I mentioned assembly once, in passing as a durable layer of abstraction.  I also mentioned a whole host of physical reasons why your input/output determinism is false, all of which are equally as devastating to your argument as the one comment you&#x27;ve zeroed in on for no particular reason.  I&#x27;d appreciate at least acknowledging that something as finicky as a PLL probably has to be included in a discussion about modern CPU&#x27;s.  Were you going to address any of that or pretend it didn&#x27;t happen?<p>> Think of this another way: say you are designing/coding a CPU. Isn&#x27;t every possible error that can happen your fault? Is that the case in C? Whose fault is it if the computer runs out of memory? If memory gets corrupted? If a hacker pokes your memory to cheat in a game? It&#x27;s no one&#x27;s fault, those things can&#x27;t be predicted. But when designing a CPU you can be sure you have the power to predict every possible thing that can happen in your problem domain. Because you&#x27;re designing a dataflow grid and an adjunct list of booleans whose semantics are immaterial to you. But in C it&#x27;s just not possible (nor in any other language, C is just a stand-in here) because you are invested in the semantics.<p>You&#x27;re not holding yourself to precise enough language for this discussion.  First of all, in this low level of a discussion using &quot;fault&quot; in the sense of assigning blame introduces needless ambiguity.  I would phrase the &quot;hacker poking&quot; example as &quot;if a ring3 process can have write access to&quot; and it approaches something precise enough to be wrong.  All of your examples are detailed in the specification for (most?) architectures, so it would be pretty clear if a simulator and a piece of silicon disagreed who was incorrect.<p>The CPU designers are NOT &quot;sure [they] have the power to predict every possible thing that can happen in [their] problem domain.&quot;  They&#x27;re smart enough to know that the space of x86 programs isn&#x27;t possible to reduce to formalism.  Random testing, directed random testing, and a lot of other strategies are in constant use that would not be if that power actually existed.  I explicitly brought this up before as being wrong, nice to see you&#x27;re not even giving me a fair read before charging ahead with your fantasy.<p>Nobody currently designing CPU&#x27;s reasons about it as a &quot;dataflow grid and an adjunct list of booleans.&quot;  This is a complete fabrication on your part.  If you have anything from any current CPU architect, designer, or engineer that actually uses this verbiage to describe what&#x27;s going on I would appreciate a link or two.  So far it looks like you&#x27;ve invented it and are willing to push for this broken metaphor instead of admit there might be something you don&#x27;t know.<p>If none of this sinks in, consider that CPU&#x27;s are written in Verilog.  Take the Cantor-diagonal proof of C being insufficient to compute all irrationals and feed Verilog into it.  Share your answer with the rest of the class.",1432986814

And when will these patents expire?<p>A good search engine is so important, I wouldn&#x27;t mind if government didn&#x27;t get into the search engine game? (Please don&#x27;t tell me government is too inept, or ruins everything they touch.  I don&#x27;t know if they could do a good job?  I wouldn&#x27;t mind converting the NSA into one large search engine--of course without the spying?)<p>In summary, I don&#x27;t know the true cost Google incures running their search engine?  I don&#x27;t think we will ever get that number at this point?  I do wish DuckDuckGo well though.  While writing this comment I keep thinking about what the person above me said--something about Yahoo BOSS API taking away free search tier, and charging $1.80 for a 1000 queries?  Whatever the case, I hope DuckDuckGo finds a way around this, and keeps improving.",1432985845

So, have you read the FAQ[0]?  From there, have you read the guidelines[1]?  From the guidelines did you see this:<p><pre><code>    What to Submit

    On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting.
              That includes more than hacking and startups. If you
              had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be:
              anything that gratifies one&#x27;s intellectual curiosity.

Even without agreeing, I can see the point.<p>That said, in my mind short of violent action, I find it hard to see how having to serve more than two decades in prison is any kind of justice for any kind of non-violent crime.  I also find that seeing the U.S. prison population at near 1% is rather depressing, and that most drugs probably shouldn&#x27;t be criminalized and their use are more representative of other social issues at hand.<p>When black markets exist to the extent that the drug trade does, it usually indicates that the law is probably wrong.  A black market for anything will always exist, but when you&#x27;re starting to see it affect even 1% of the population as it does in this case, that should indicate that legally, the position should change in a way that reduces the need for such markets.

(I specify a date since the main ideas described in those books now pervade culture, so they would have less of an impact now.)<p>Regarding Scandinavian languages and gender, &quot;Norwegian has three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter—except the Bergen dialect, which has only two genders: common and neuter.&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language</a>).

Of course we do feel our Framework is compelling but it&#x27;s just about getting that across to other devs in a clear manner in our marketing. We&#x27;ve found that whenever we&#x27;ve started a new project and we&#x27;ve needed a particular a set of components, it&#x27;s been a pain trying to find the correct one to use, ones that have been kept upto date and then also ensuring they all work seamlessly together. Developers will of course have their own coding styles etc and trying to make each one work nicely in our projects is never easy. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve tried to make everything in our framework absolutely consistent. Everything has the same coding style, is fully themable etc<p>It&#x27;s a good point on cocoapods. It&#x27;s something we&#x27;ll definitely look in to thanks. We&#x27;d created the template as a way for newbie devs to have less hassle when trying to get a project started with our framework. I think another point we need to try and get across better on our site is how existing apps can use our framework.<p>On licensing, yep it&#x27;ll just be a downloadable file that developers will need to just drop into their project somewhere. That will allow them to build the app to a device rather than just the simulator.",1432983675

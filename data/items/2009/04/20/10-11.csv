It seems safe to assume that there are more places where this is the case.<p>Part of this is also based on our experience when accepting payments. It seems a lot harder to convert a free member to a paying one as soon as you leave the USA. It seems to me that how we accept payments (PayPal, MoneyBookers) is at least in some part responsible for that.<p>What do people in your geographical area prefer to use for online payments? Is it the credit card, plain old SWIFT/BIC or IBAN, some national payment system?<p>Is there a payment processor like PayPal that's very popular in your area? (Especially if customers need an account.)",1240223902

570430,comment,570407,570407,0,0,alexandros,,,"The question is a very good one. However the answer is unconvincing to me. By this reasoning, should someone make a jquery compiler that blocks the access to the original javascript language, and perhaps fills in any resulting holes in fuctionality, then jQuery would be a language. But how much would have really changed? And also, should then someone implement this new JQuery within a javascript environment, we would be talking about an embedded language within another language. but isn't that what we have now? I think to the extent that a library brings in new syntactic styles, it becomes more and more similar to a language.<p>As an aside, this got me thinking about compilers that can compile multiple languages in the same source file.. a kind of linguistic pick-n-choose... has anything been done along those lines?",1240221655

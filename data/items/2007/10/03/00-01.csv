The only reason it gets any press/traffic at all is because of Kawasaki. You always hear of it as ""Kawasaki's Truemors."" <p>At least the man knows how to leverage slight success on his name's reputation alone. ",1191372599

Usually chill/ambient electronica with good repetitive beats-- the best example is Angel by Massive Attack. I turn that way up and hack the night away, sometimes.<p>\n",1191372265

62363,comment,62196,62196,0,0,blader,,,"I remember having this conversation at Startup School last year with some very smart hackers over dinner. The overwhelming majority felt that Facebook was exactly that, a fad like MySpace or Friend or whatever, that it won't be around in 5 years, that they don't have any real technology, etc. I was the only person who disagreed.<p>I argued that they have an amazing team, that they control the most accurate and real social graph on the planet, they are cooking up something big with it, and they will without a doubt not only be around, but be much bigger in 5 years. <p>6 months, 1 platform, 5000 apps, and 50 million users later, I'm feeling pretty comfortable about my stance, I don't know about the other guys.",1191371845

So by running XP as the host, I could let Microsoft handle the drivers and then have VMWare mooch off them via bridged networking.<p>It's probably better now, but I've gotten used to this setup, so I see no real reason to change until I get my next computer.",1191371686
62360,comment,62109,62227,0,0,nailer,,,"As another poster pointed out, the coder in question isn't owned by anyone.<p>I don't see how it's more or less moral to make the offer before or after the application. The coder's relationship with his existing team, and that teams product, should be compelling enough for the coder to stick with them. <p>If it isn't, then it's within his rights to move towards a better opportunity, and within someone else's rights to provide that opportunity.  <p>That said, I think this post should have consisted of a simple, polite statement of caveman82's case. Comments about 'The Accuser' running to his mother are immature and only hurt Caveman82's reputation.<p>",1191371472

It was-- with the market that we've chosen, with the traction that we have, and with the challenges I wrote about (largely team commitment), is funding something that I should consider pursuing?",1191370203

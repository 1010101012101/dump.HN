I'm Mikael, one of the co-founders from Launch This Year, a step-by-step guide to building a mobile app. Launch This Year was put live mid-day on January 1st, 2013 as a single page website with email collection.<p>About a week later, Lifehacker and VentureBeat covered us and we've now got over 20,000+ total members. We're hoping to create an awesome community of indie devs and mobile lovers.<p>We started Launch This Year with the goal of giving indie devs a list of action items they should do along the way to releasing their apps.<p>The premise is simple. After selecting the date you want to release your app, we tell you what actions you should be doing next to stay on track. There's a lot of hurdles when it comes to the App Store so our hope is to break this apart into smaller, actionable steps.The first steps are pretty basic: defining your project's problem/solution, basic app details, and setting up a landing page.<p>Eventually, we'll get into more intensive tracks like designing the icon, getting press, and App Store Optimization.<p>URL: http://launchthisyear.com/<p>Launch This Year starts tomorrow but use ""hackernews"" (without the quotes) as the invite code to get immediate access today.<p>Curious to know what you think.<p>- Mikael",1358175540

In those countries, people color inside the lines.<p>Whaaaat, you have got to be kidding me.<p>Colouring inside the lines? Let's see, the Demoscene is almost exclusively a European phenomenon. There's the CCC. Fravia did not exactly colour inside the lines. There's the Pirate Bay. Wikileaks. Just a colourful few from the top of my head, there's more if you dig further.<p>If you really have to look for a difference with Silicon Valley, I'd say it's about making money, startups, entrepreneurship, chasing <i>that</i> ""American Dream"", contrast with the above examples which are all people that did it for idealism, art or just for the heck of it, instead of for profit. In that context, Aaron Swartz falls squarely in the latter category.<p>Before you throw a fit about my stereotyping, stop. The distinction I sketched in the previous paragraph is just as stupid as the one Graham tried to make. I think it's stupid to draw a distinction between US and EU like this[0], after all, that's what this global communication information age is about. There's ""startup-hackers"" in the EU just as much as there are ""tinkerer-hackers"" in the US.<p>Having said that, the first thing I thought when reading that headline was ""wow, if a big media outlet like the Washington Post names you 'American Hero', you really did something very right"", and I felt happy.

So why should microsoft spend time on creating them when a super tiny percentage of users will ever use them?<p>c) Driver management (in my personal experience) is easier in windows than it is in linux.<p>d) Go back in time, before the internet, when linux package managers only showed you what was installed on the system at a given time and only offered you the option to install packages you had already downloaded/copied to the system. That is what the microsoft thingy (Cant remember the name atm) is. It might not be as fancy as the linux variant, but it is still, in fact, a type of package manager and the MSI files are still, in fact, a type of package manager.\nEnjoy your garage parking lot + valet.<p>The theme from your comments is that a inexperienced user, like your wife f.x. which you used as an example, has a easier time doing pretty much ANYTHING in windows than in linux.

Well, I hope Aaron's whole-hearted devotion was gratifying to SOMEONE.

5054809,comment,5054618,5054754,9,0,gklitt,,,"Agreed. I went to Japanese elementary school (in college now, so within the last 15 years) and didn't learn this lines method ever.<p>What I found greatest about the Japanese method of learning multiplication was actually the method for learning single-digit products. The Japanese use a system called ""kuku"" (translated, ""9 by 9"") which involves memorizing a rhythmic chant that goes through the entire multiplication table, with each product being concisely expressed in a few syllables. This is made possible by the various ways in which a number can be pronounced in Japanese.<p>I think the method is made necessary because to say the full products takes a lot of syllables in Japanese (e.g. 7x7=49 would be ""nana kakeru nana wa yonjyuu-kyuu""). So perhaps it doesn't differ too much from the way you learn multiplication tables at an English-speaking school, but a cool method nonetheless.<p>Video here:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hLyzXM53IE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hLyzXM53IE</a>",1358175175

If you're not willing to do the minimum of cast a vote (in Aus, that's one each of council, state, federal, every 3-4 years) then you don't really have the right to complain. You may not have a candidate to vote for, but you definitely will have one to vote against.<p>I'd turn that on its head, and say that everyone who votes has dirt on their hands. They've all participated in propping up that government, and they're the ones who should not complain when that same government regulates, taxes, or otherwise harasses them. Those who did not vote, did not give consent.<p>>As for a 'none of the above', on a paper ballot, you can write what you want.<p>There is no write-in option where I live. One could, I suppose, write whatever they'd like on the ballot, in effect ""spoiling"" the ballot. But not showing up to vote would have a similar effect.<p>>Of course, we have voting well organised - here you won't see queues of eight hours to vote like the debacle in Florida. This is despite mandatory voter turnout and paper ballots.<p>That is a good thing, for sure. If you're going to force voting on the population, a good way to get them to turn against the idea would be to have American-style efficiency in place!<p>>It's nice though, that you put an evil spin on mandatory voting by labelling it 'coerced'. I wonder if you call traffic lights 'coercion'? I personally think of it more as a citizen's responsibility, but I wouldn't try to colour it by calling it 'responsible voting'.<p>If I am faced with a fine of some kind for not voting, that is most definitely coercion. Traffic lights, whatever one may think of them, are not directly coercive, though they are increasingly a revenue-generating stream for local governments (a separate problem entirely).",1358173795

It inspired me to learn C and tinker with Linux and BSD. It also had a part on a quirky math phase I had - which ended causing my math teachers pain when trying to teach a 13 year old the usual basics ended having to grade exams with the most intricate and elaborate (and long) solutions to simple questions and puzzles.<p>It inspired me to open up my old Packard Bell branded computer and tinker with it until a soldering iron made it meet it's demise. This series of texts also inspired in me a need to know everything there is about computer security, and of course, the only way to put that knowledge to the test is in real world applications like hacking the school systems to take a peek at que quarterly final exams, compromising machines to use as botnets to do fun stuff in IRC, and of course taking advantage of the ""unlimited"" bandwidth available to the school. Thankfully the school took this as a rebellious kid/teen learning as much as possible about computers and systems and ending up giving me the task to secure their network and physical machines, to the dismay of the actual computer administrators in school.<p>I bet that this type of reading material inspired an army of people just like me to tinker, hack, and learn as much as possible. Aaron Swartz was probably one of them - being only three years younger than me, and probably one of the most influential in this harsh times for both hackers and activists.

5054687,comment,5053949,5054622,36,0,api,,,"It's a valid point. I have a confession though: I was a teenage hacker (in the cracking sense). I suspect many people around here were.<p>I didn't break stuff or steal stuff <i>on purpose</i>, or have explicit malicious intent. I practiced what is sometimes called ""catch and release"" hacking. It was a game... to me at least. I'm sure it was an annoyance to the ones on the other end, but I was 14-15 and wasn't thinking like that.<p>But boy did I ever learn a lot. By the time I made it to college, I knew more than a lot of the CS seniors. So much that I didn't bother majoring in CS. I wanted to learn something else. At 18 I knew: C, C++, 80x86 assembler, shell script, Perl, how to compose and validate an IP packet, the OSI networking model, basic protocol design, peer to peer protocol design concepts, and quite a bit about cryptography including how to properly construct an authenticated cryptographic envelope and the importance of choosing the right block cipher mode of operation. Password cracking led me to hash functions and SALTs, which led me down the rabbit hole, and I got fascinated with crypto. At one point I worked through the math of Diffie-Hellman and RSA. It was very hard stuff, and required that I delve into a lot of deep math that was way beyond me at 15 going on 16. But knowing it made me more of a badass hacker ninja. Cause it was crypto, and crypto was big time hacker stuff. When I comprehended the one-way trap door function behind Diffie-Hellman I felt like I'd stolen a car and gone joyriding with the archetypal cool kids.<p>More than that, I found that my knowledge was more hands-on than the CS students I encountered. I not only thought in code, but thought in networks. To this day networking and network protocols are completely natural to me, while otherwise very good programmers tend to gnash their teeth at the thought of implementing them. Also, for some reason this network experience translated right into multithreaded coding. Working with threads, even at a low level, with all the blocking and priority inversion issues, is no sweat. Network hacking made me comfortable with non-determinism.<p>I highly doubt I'd know this without the challenge of hacking (sense 2).<p>But wait, you say... why don't we just create a corewar-style game? Why can't schools have Defcon-style attack/defend tournaments.<p>I wouldn't have touched this with a ten foot pole. No rebellion, no interest. That would have been an ""organized activity"" put forward by adults. Blech.<p>Honestly, a similar ethos got me interested in startups much later. Startups sort of felt rebellious in a way... like little scrappy hack-trepreneurs sticking it to the big guys. It was when startups popped their shirt collars and went all douchey and ""mainstream"" that I lost interest.",1358172944

In fact, there are too many situations where it is a rational choice to even come close to listing them all. A few off the top of my head would be:<p>1. If a person is dying of cancer with no known cure and medical costs are hurting the dying's family's future, that's a helluva rational choice in my opinion.<p>2. If a man is facing an imminent and lengthy jail sentence and is claustrophobic, suicide is perfectly rational.<p>If a man is in a situation where he foresees no way out for a lengthy period and chooses not to be in that situation, suicide is a perfectly rational choice.",1358172230

But I think differently.<p>When I said life has no purpose, I didn't mean it was futile or nihilist or anything else. I mean that words like ""purpose"" simply do not apply. Purpose is an anthropological term and is meaningless in this context. To what ""purpose"" do mountains rise, volcanoes erupt, meteors explode in the sky? It is inappropriate to try to find purpose in these things. Purpose is a human concept.<p>This applies to life too. We are here because we, by whatever crazy turns of chance and happenstance, are here. There is no other answer; indeed that is not even one. We may be wiped out by a meteor tomorrow and the universe cares not one whit.<p>Why, you ask? Who on earth are you asking? There is no ""why"". Why did the coin come up heads or tails? Why does someone live and someone else die in an automobile accident? Why is that rock here, and not over there? There is no ""why"". For there to be a reason, someone needs to have thought about it, and there is no someone. There are causes and effects, yes, but no ""why"".<p>So what do we do next? We do what we are programmed to do, after thousands of generations of trial and error - we love one another, treat each other with kindness, some of us screw up, but mostly we try to pull together to improve our world and the lives of the people we love. Because that is all we are, animals with organic computers for brains and this is the program we are running, and there's no ""why"" for that, either.",1358172078

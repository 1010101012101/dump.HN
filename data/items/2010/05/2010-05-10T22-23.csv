Haven't had a problem with the other things, other than the flaky touch sensing - I'm pretty sure this is a software problem, because when I run into it (once ever 2-3 days) I've gotten into the habit of sleeping and waking the phone with the top button, which seems to fix it.<p>The poster above is right about it being a little 'scruffy' in terms of not having a completely smooth user experience...but like him, I'm OK with that because I like having a pocket computer rather than an appliance.

The likelihood that the first drive will fail doesn't change because the second one failed -- which is the classic statistical blunder. (""I got 42 heads in a row, the next one's BOUND to be tails!"")<p>Every single drive in the datacenter typically has the same likelihood of failure (since they're usually the same make and model, and similar production runs), so the odds that a drive somewhere in a large data center is failing RIGHT NOW are in reality rather high.<p>The Big Mac ended up being a good example of this. The likelihood of having a memory error on a normal PC is low, because the likelihood of a single DIMM having a memory error is low.<p>Punch that up to the 22,000 or thereabouts DIMMs that populated the Big Mac cluster, and now you're looking at a very HIGH likelihood that a large-scale computation using the cluster will experience memory errors, and therefore produce invalid results -- which is why UVa ended up replacing the entire cluster with ECC-equipped machines in short order. Until they did that, researchers had to run simulations multiple times and compare results to make sure that their simulations weren't contaminated by memory errors.",1273531185

That is if you create a perception of lower crime you get gentrification and a lot of middle class people move in and crime may actually go down. But nobody should confuse the talk of politicians with actual reality, new york is much more crooked and crime ridden than any of those ""tough on crime"" politicians would admit. Some times that crookedness bubbles up to the surface, for example couple of summers ago when cranes started falling from the sky and killing people and destroying entire buildings.<p>I have to say that I feel bad for these cops.

1336099,comment,1335895,1335895,0,0,mdasen,,,"The reason that people are hammering at Flash so much is that there's one implementation of Flash and, for years, Adobe and Macromedia actively tried to stifle alternative implementations.  Why does this matter?  Over time, when there's competition between implementations, they all tend to get worked on and improve.  Look at Apple's JavaScriptCore and Google's V8.  Heck, even Firefox has improved JavaScript performance a lot compared to previous versions and Internet Explorer.  The competition is so important that Microsoft has put a lot of effort into IE9 making JavaScript a lot faster there.<p>Right now, most implementations of HTML5, Canvas, and SVG aren't so fast.  I've seen demos that show them getting fewer frames per second than Flash for animations.  But the point is that they're open technologies whose implementations can and will improve.  Flash has been a closed technology for so long and Adobe has taken that lack of competition and ignored performance concerns.<p>With video, it's the same situation.  While browsers might not be using less CPU right now playing H.264, there's the potential for better decoding in the future.  VLC uses very little resources on my Mac decoding H.264 video.  It's not merely Safari's access to hardware acceleration since VLC doesn't use hardware acceleration.<p>The problem with Flash is that it doesn't allow companies like Apple, Mozilla, Google, and even Microsoft the opportunity to increase efficiency; it doesn't allow an army of volunteers to improve a code base.  It's just stagnated since there was no other way to do animation and vector graphics until recently.<p>The problem with Flash isn't where it is now in comparison to other techniques.  The problem with Flash is that the other techniques are open and improving at a rapid pace while Flash isn't.  The problem with Flash is that open technologies have lots of smart people working to improve them and make their implementations better while Flash is remaining much the same.<p>Our objection to Flash is that we can see what happened with JavaScript and Ajax (from apps like Google Maps and Gmail to toolkits like jQuery and Prototype) happening with vector images, animation, and video if there's an open standard that all companies and individuals can freely implement and use; with Flash, all we can see is Adobe continuing to feed us the same product we've had for years.",1273529365

1336089,comment,1335805,1335805,0,0,whalesalad,,,"Toto might be a ""WordPress Killer"" <i>for hackers</i>, but that's just about it.<p>There are two reasons why WordPress is wildly successful...<p>(1) It's built in PHP so it can run on anything. Any webhost out there will run it, and 99% of them will have a ""one-click-install"" button for you.<p>(2) It has a pretty damn good admin interface and theme/plugin community. Anyone can install themes and plugins, either thru the interface or with some simple FTP knowledge.<p>All of this aside... I can't effing stand WordPress. I've been developing for it since it first branched off from the b2 blogging engine many moons ago. For a developer, building a complete site in WP generally consists of hacking plugins to work with one another, or writing your own modifications.<p>I built this site (<a href=""http://arbesko.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arbesko.com</a>) in WordPress because the client wanted it. Only about 10% of it is WP. I extended the URL rewriting system and wrote all of my own template code, most of the queries were written by hand. An experience WP dev might frown upon this because of ""future incompatibility"" but honestly, if you want to write good shit you're not gonna find it with WP's built in tools. The only thing left that isn't my own is pretty much the DB.<p>For a super simple blog, go with WP. For a ""WP as a CMS site"", don't fall for that bullshit. Write it in something else, anything else. Write it from scratch in Perl for all I care, just stay away from using WP for anything more than a blog and/or <i>very</i> simple site.<p>And again, these kinds of things (toto, jekyll, etc...) are fun for hackers, but they will never kill WP. If you want to kill WP you're going to need to attack it from the perspective of an ""SEO Marketing social media expert from Tampa FL who has 2 kids and runs the Tampa Tweetup every weekend"", and not that of a hacker. The most you can expect from someone is installing an FTP client and uploading it. These people don't play with terminals or git.",1273529179

Subtitles seem good, and there are corpora of casual speech.<p>I plan to heavily bias towards verbs. Nouns are much more long-tailed, and their frequency is &quot;bursty&quot; --- if the noun is relevant to the situation, it&#x27;ll be used a lot. So you can get them when you need them.

In at least one area this is dramatic: Some people are insulin sensitive and some are insulin resistant.  I looked at the nutrition label on soylent. It might be healthy for insulin sensitive people, who generally tend to be naturally skinny.<p>But this would be a terrible thing for someone who is insulin resistant to consume.  It has a very high amount of carbs and fat, which means that your body will see the carbs, blood sugar will spike the insulin will spike very high to compensate (since you&#x27;re resistant you need more of it to get your blood sugar down) and the high levels of insulin tell the body to start storing fat... consequently making you fatter.<p>Unfortunately, so much of the diet science assumes everyone is the same, and ignores the insulin sensitivity factor (and I bet there are several other factors going on as well that aren&#x27;t understood.)",1433566765

We aren&#x27;t sure immutability everywhere is the solution for everything, some algorithms and programs are much more efficient with mutable data.<p>I think Go is quite popular and have an amazing concurrency support.

Java 9 will contain two relevant changes. The first, JEP 165[1] (fine-grained and method-context dependent control of the JVM compilers), lets you control compilation with metadata depending on context (e.g. inline method foo when called from bar); a much more interesting and powerful enhancement targeted for Java 9 is JEP 243[2] (Java-Level JVM Compiler Interface). It will do the following:<p>* Allow the JVM to load Java plug-in code to examine and intercept JVM JIT activity.<p>* Record events related to compilation, including counter overflow, compilation requests, speculation failure, and deoptimization.<p>* Allow queries to relevant metadata, including loaded classes, method definitions, profile data, dependencies (speculative assertions), and compiled code cache.<p>* Allow an external module to capture compilation requests and produce code to be used for compiled methods.<p>This opens the door to what I think is the most impressive compiler of the last decade, and a true breakthrough in (JIT) compiler design: Graal[3]. Graal supports languages of any level (it already has frontends for Java, C, Ruby, Python, R and JavaScript), and then allows complete control over code generation and optimization decisions at runtime. E.g. you tell it what kind of speculations to make, and it tells you which speculations failed. Unlike LLVM, you compile your language into a semantic AST (that may or may not match the language&#x27;s AST) and feed it to Graal, but each node may contain not just semantics but instructions on speculation and code-gen control at any level you wish. During compilation, Graal interacts with the node and the node gives further instructions. As I understand it, JEP 243 will allow to plug Graal into the standard OpenJDK HotSpot (though at reduced speed), until Graal matures enough to become HotSpot&#x27;s default compiler.<p>So what Graal will do is let the developer (if the language designer allows), write simple, high-level code, but tell the compiler, &quot;listen, compile however you like, but when you get to this function, talk to me because I have some ideas on how to compile it just right&quot;.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/165"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/165</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/243"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/243</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Graal/Publications+and+Presentations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Graal/Publications+and...</a>",1433565690

And from time to time we profile and optimize further, we like speed.<p>I believe with time Rust can achieve a similar performance, maybe even better because they will be able to do incremental compilation (maybe, I&#x27;m not sure how will they do that with parameterized types).<p>There&#x27;s also the thing that most of the things in Crystal are lazy: if you don&#x27;t invoke a method there are no type checks to be done for it.

There&#x27;s also simply a ton of low-hanging fruit lying around: we&#x27;re only two weeks out from 1.0 and the nightly compiler is already reportedly 30% faster for code compiling in the wild. There&#x27;s another 10% compilation speed reduction coming from work around optimizing linking.

Inter-system communication is probably the best place for binary or any place that needs high speed real-time communication with the smallest size to fit in MTU limits (game protocols over UDP for instance). Any place that you control the client and server is ok to use binary.<p>However, I do feel there is a strange swaying back to binary (Protobuf/HTTP/2/etc). Developers are trying to wedge it in now in places it may cause more problems because it is more efficient in performance but not in use or implementation. Plus, like mentioned in this thread, you can compress JSON to be very small to send over the wire which makes the compactness of it a non-issue in non real-time cases. Going binary just to go binary is more trouble than it is worth in most cases.<p>- Binary over keyed plain text (JSON) is harder to generically parse objects i.e. dictionaries/lists for just a few fields/keys.<p>- Binary over JSON also seems to lock down messaging more, people have more work to change binary explicit messages because of offset issues and client/server tools must be in sync rather than just adding a new key that can be pulled as needed.<p>- Third party implementation and parsing of JSON/XML is more forgiving making version upgrades and changes easier to do. This is especially apparent on projects that are taken over by other developers.<p>- The language/platform on the backend leaks into the messaging.  For instance Protobuf only runs on js/python currently and has various versions. The best messaging is independent of the platform and versioning is easier.<p>I would bet binary formats end up causing more bugs over keyed/plaintext (JSON/XML and possibly compressed) though I have nothing to back that up by except my own experience largely in game development where networking state is almost always binary, for server/data I wouldn&#x27;t use it unless it needs to be real-time.<p>That being said Protobuf is awesome and I hope developers are using it where it is best suited and that developers don&#x27;t start obfuscating messaging for performance where it doesn&#x27;t really need to be, better to be simple unless you need to make it more complex at every level.",1433564272

The majority sacrificed timeliness for social relevance or depth. We often got our news later than friends who weren&#x27;t using aggregators! We also found ourselves living in an increasingly small filter bubble because many of these apps were defining what we&#x27;d be interested in by what&#x27;s popular in our social graph. Trigger is our first attempt at addressing these problems. We hand curate sources (to ensure quality inputs) and use a predictive algorithm to bring you news before it starts trending.<p>We&#x27;ve also got a kind of cool &quot;extra-social&quot; discovery feature OVERLOOKED that finds the most interesting things your social graph ISN&#x27;T reading.<p>We&#x27;d love if you&#x27;d check us out and let us know what you think over at itunes.apple.com/us/app/id968265755",1433564208

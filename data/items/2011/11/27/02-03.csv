Say goodbye to the vast majority of automobile deaths every year.<p>But that still doesn't address the problem facing most large cities: gridlock. Whether the cars are automated or not won't drastically change that (although it may well reduce arterial traffic clogs due to accidents and rubbernecking) because there are still more cars than the roads can handle.<p>I really don't know why California is pursuing this. Planes are entirely valid solution to the problem of travelling between LA and SF. Why spend billions on an alternative that's going to take <i>twenty years</i>?<p>If anything, spend the money on public transport to reduce reliance on cars. The situation is decent in SF, poor in the Valley (Caltrain covers a limited area and runs quite infrequently) and woeful in LA. The 101 out of SF tends to be a car park at certain times (although not as bad as LA).<p>The big problem is that LA isn't <i>really</i> space-constrained. It has the ocean on the west but has sprawled far north, south and east. People like their big homes and that's a recipe for disaster when it comes to public transport. The only places public transport seems to work at all are those areas densely population or that have existing infrastructure (eg the commuter belt around NYC). But Dallas? Atlanta? LA?

3281479,comment,3280418,3281108,5,0,Silhouette,,,"> Are you saying we should not listen to instructors and don't bother reading books that are being written by someone who haven't ""produced"" anything in its respective industry?<p>That might be going too far, but if someone presumes to teach others a subject, should they not have <i>something</i> that supports their authority and gives their advice some credibility? A track record of doing the job successfully themselves makes pretty solid case in that regard. Another respectable possibility would be having studied the work of others, if the teacher is presenting arguments based on careful observations of that work.<p>However, most of the Agile consultancy crowd have precious little personal track record and precious little empirical data to back up the things they recommend either. Instead, they tend to rely on selective evidence, unwarranted extrapolation, over-generalisation and crude insults as their debating tools of choice.<p>Unsurprisingly, there is also data available that contradicts some of the consultants' favourite arguments. Typically, they ignore such data in their own presentations. If challenged with it, they usually try to hand-wave it away by reinterpreting something they have previously said or conveniently redefining their terms.<p>The trouble is, given the high profile that these consultants maintain, a lot of impressionable new starters in our industry read their writing and do take it as gospel. Then they start working with other people, and their managers and mentors and colleagues have to waste a silly amount of time undoing the damage.<p>I've been that undoing-the-damage guy on way too many occasions. I have absolutely no doubt that people like Robert C. Martin are harmful to our industry. I wish he would keep the preaching in church and leave software development to people who understand that professionalism does not require blind faith in whatever he happens to believe himself.<p>I realise that I have myself indulged in a bit of character assassination without evidence here.

3281477,comment,3281089,3281298,14,0,jballanc,,,"I think the crux of the problem is that a fiat currency doesn't just attempt to capture the current resources, debts, and means of production for a country (or group of countries, in this case). There is also the element of future resources, debts, and means of production. I suspect uncertainty in the future is the main cause for all the recent problems, in the Eurozone and elsewhere.<p>Consider the times we are living in. It is likely that we are reaching a point that humanity has never faced before and will never face again (at least, not humanity as we recognize it). I like to call it ""stationary phase"", after the same concept that occurs in growing populations of bacteria.<p>Essentially, human population growth is beginning to decelerate. Changes in infant mortality and life expectancy are leading to vast demographic shifts that will most likely be permanent. What does this have to do with a fiat currency and debt?<p>Consider why one would take on debt. If I can acquire resources at a fixed constant rate, then it makes no sense to take on debt instead of simply saving up over time. Debt only makes sense when the means of production, and therefore resources available, accelerate over time. I can borrow now, because even though I have to pay back more later, I will have more even than what I need to pay back at that time.<p>So what causes means of production to accelerate? Lots of factors to be sure: more raw materials to exploit, gains in efficiency, etc. A very large factor, however, is accelerating population growth. Even if materials available and efficiency remain constant, more workers means more production and an accelerating growth in workers means an acceleration in the means of production over time.<p>But that's all coming to and end in the near future. So, to compensate, we could accelerate the exploitation of raw materials. Unfortunately, one of the most important raw materials for human economy, oil, is also decelerating in its rate of exploitation.<p>That puts the entire onus of accelerating means of production on increases in efficiency. Consider it a call to arms for knowledge workers around the world. The only other alternative is to fundamentally change the way that economies work. If we cannot accelerate the means of production, then we cannot run economies based on debt.<p>What makes this whole situation all the more interesting is that if population growth stabilizes at some future point (i.e. zero real growth), then we may be very close to reaching the point where current means of production are sufficient to satisfy the needs of the existing population. Ultimately, the need for debt is based on the desire to borrow from the future so that we can do what is necessary to accelerate means of production, so that the means of production can catch up with accelerating population growth. <i>If</i> everything gradually comes to a halt simultaneously, then we may just reach a ""stationary phase"" where the most important goal for economies is to remain stable, as opposed to today where the most important goal is exponential growth.<p>That, unfortunately, is the optimistic view. If things don't quite mesh up, expect the next century or so to be rather messy...",1322362289

Various types of gold standards have failed many times in history, including pegs to gold. The reason is almost always the same: countries will overspend no matter what currency they use - wars/militarism are often the excuse. Notable failures include:<p>- helping worsen, if not cause, the US Great Depression (US Fed decided to defend the peg to gold);<p>- helping cause the Weimar German hyperinflation (due to the victors taking almost all the German gold reserves for WWI reparations).<p>3. Free floating, market-traded fiat currencies solved the core problem of a physical <i>fixed</i> currency like gold.

3281442,comment,3281176,3281259,21,0,oz,,,"I was a sysadmin for a financial services firm, and then for a Big-4 accounting firm, so I may have some perspective:<p>1. <i>""For starters, I was not allowed to use my own equipment. They rattled off some gibberish about security and support even though my mail client supports SMTP and I can read Office files just fine. Also, for an agency focused on security their insistence on using Windows XP was baffling.""</i><p>The first rule of System Administration [0] is to start every host in a known state. The reason for this is <i>predictability</i> - as the sysadmin, you know what to expect - certain software is installed, certain settings are configured, etc. You simply CANNOT manage systems at scale without this approach. Without it, testing, upgrades etc. are a shots in the dark.<p>Another issue is ownership. Let's say you get company email on your personal BlackBerry. You're mugged, and the device is stolen. A competent administrator will immediately issue a WIPE command from the BlackBerry Enterprise Server, so that all data is erased. But wait! Those picture of your daughter's recital were on the phone. They're gone, and you're gonna be pissed. With a company-owned device, the expectations are different.<p>A friend of mine once had to re-image the laptop of a senior executive. Turns out, the only pictures of her daughter's high-school graduation were on it. A year later, he's still having to feed her stories about ongoing efforts to retrieve the data...<p>Regarding Windows XP, OS upgrades are not to be done lightly. It requires very extensive regression testing for all Line-of-Business apps. Believe me, there isn't an IT guy there who doesn't want the upgrade to Win 7, but after a time in this business, you learn to tread carefully, as information systems can break in all sorts of subtle ways and management doesn't want to hear it.<p>2. <i>""Secondly, I was told I could only use a certain browser because of another incoherent argument relying on ""security."" Interestingly, nothing was done to keep me from putting a pocket version of Firefox on a flash drive and connect to my own secure proxy. This is because the IT guys had no idea such wizardry was even possible.""</i><p>Again, standards. When their enterprise web-based ERP system that's been tested in IE6 and works fine breaks when you're using Chrome 15.0.874.121 m, who's gonna get the call? Oh that's right. IT. Multiply that by a few hundred machines, and your network is unmanageable.<p>There exists technology to control USB drives, but in most organizations, it won't fly - they're simply too convenient. Besides, how do you expect the VP of Sales to load his iPod? Definitely shame on your IT guys for not blocking outbound connections to your own proxy at the firewall.<p>3. <i>""Thirdly, for some reason print jobs were routed out of the office to a data center in San Angelo and then routed back to the printer down the hall. Printing a single page was non-deterministic and painful, never mind my final reports. This was a result of some state mandate about consolidating IT.""</i><p>This sounds like the state's fault. They were probably sold a solution that promised centralized tracking / routing of print jobs, based on parameters such as job submitter, color vs monochrome, time of day, printer availability etc. Not IT's fault.<p>4. <i>""And then there was the time I tried to install Notepad++ to do some minor dev work (they hired a CS undergrad to do financial work so I thought I'd do more than estimate results). 2 weeks later I was approved to use a similar text editor on the grounds that I already have a task bar to manage multiple documents - a tab bar is completely unnecessary and Notepad++ requires further scrutiny. 3 weeks later I had a Perl interpreter.""</i><p>I was a sysadmin, and <i>I</i> had to get written and signed approval from my Manager, the Security Manager and the CIO to install <i>any</i> non-standard application. Pleasant? No. Necessary? Yes - everything needs to documented; otherwise these things spiral out of control <i>quickly</i>.<p>5. <i>""At my current job they forced me to let them change the root password on my issued machine to something they knew and I didn't. I get why you do this: because you cannot fully trust people and I dealt with sensitive data; fine. Afterward I re-installed my OS and set my root password back. I don't understand why they don't think these things through.""</i><p>Don't take this personally, but sysadmins hate people like you - you make unauthorized changes and make our lives difficult. Your IT guys sound incompetent though - why weren't BIOS passwords in place to prevent booting from CD? And since you say root password, sounds like you were in a UNIX / Linux shop. If you were in an AD environment, after reinstalling, you wouldn't have been able to join your computer to the domain without domain administrator credentials.<p>I understand that the situation sucks, but there are good (at least for a particular meaning of good) reasons why it is so. There is room for improvement on both sides.<p>Whew. Felt good to get all that off my chest. No hard feelings?<p>[0] Tom Limoncelli - The Practice of System & Network Administration.",1322361450
3281441,comment,3281089,3281370,13,0,flourpower,,,"I think this tendency to mythologize certain financial derivatives is weird. The concept of a macro is way more complex than the concept of a credit default swap. To demonstrate, here is (in my opinion) an explanation of credit default swaps that a person with no financial background should be able to understand.<p>A bond is a contract created and sold by an ""issuer"". The issuer can be a government or a company. Ownership of the bond entitles you to payments from the issuer. The specific number and size of payments varies from bond to bond. Once the issuer sells the bond to someone, that person can sell the bond to anyone else they want.<p>A credit default swap is a contract between two parties (neither of which is necessarily the aforementioned issuer) that are usually called the protection buyer and the protection seller. This contract is made in reference to someone called the reference entity. The protection buyer agrees to make a series of payments to the protection seller in exchange for the protection seller's promise that, in the case of a ""credit event"", they will give the protection buyer either some specified amount of money or some specified amount of bonds. The nature of the payments and the meaning of ""credit event"" vary from contract to contract, but generally a ""credit event"" is understood to have occurred if the reference entity (which is always an issuer) fails to make payments on some of the bonds it has sold. Either party in the contract is free to find someone else to take up their side of the trade at whatever price they can negotiate.<p>The only thing you needed to know to understand that was what a contract was, but if you want to understand macros, you really need to know what an interpreter is.",1322361377

But i think its the frequency with which i smoke - everyday - that can be damaging in the way i described. It doesn't ruin my life: i won't lose my job, and i can still go about my normal duties perfectly fine. However my tendency is to do the minimal amount possible to get by, instead of excelling and doing anything above and beyond that.<p>100% agree with your assertion of heightened imagination and visualisation, it also changes your thought patterns in such a way that your train of thinking may lead to interesting perspectives that you would have never otherwise arrived at. It's what drew me to cannabis in the first place; intellectually i was intrigued by the creativity cannabis brought on. That said, a creative mind does not a productive person make! it's one thing to visualise etc. but it's the doing/execution part that seems so far out of reach when you're under the influence of cannabis. At least that's what i've come to realise.<p>As for habit-forming, I've always smoked cannabis with tobacco, but never smoked tobacco alone. This puts put me in quite a unique position in that after ten years i clearly have a nicotine addiction, meaning my use of nicotine is so entwined with my cannabis use that it's hard to mentally separate the two. Over time it occurred to me that i could never be sure whether i wanted to get stoned because i enjoyed the sensation, or whether it was purely for want of nicotine, with getting stoned being a proxy for that. Interestingly, i have recently quit smoking cannabis inasmuch that i now use a vaporiser to get high, which means i have also cut out tobacco completely. It's been around 5 weeks since i last smoked cannabis with tobacco, and i definitely have less of a want to get stoned, so i guess my suspicions were correct - nicotine was fueling my cannabis habit to some degree.<p>That link was intriguing, especially the inverse proportionality of benefits vs. dose size. It must be remembered however that the drug administered was a synthetic form of THC, not actual THC - presumably there were modifications to the molecular structure else they would have just used a THC extract straight from the plant. I'm sure it can still be taken as indicative of potential benefits of actual THC as a therapeutic drug though.<p>I think overall i'm just going through a transition period in my life, a slight epiphany; realising that i've been abusing cannabis and that my use has been detrimental to other areas of my life. My recreational use grew into habitual use, which brought with it a constant <i>lack</i> of boredom, leaving me unproductive and demotivated. I expect that i'll have all but given up cannabis within a year, if my current trend of usage continues. Maybe i'm just growing out of it, or that perhaps my desire to be productive is finally outweighing my desire to get high. Either way, i feel good about the changes.",1322361032

Companies which looked at IT as a cost center tended to have bad IT service, where as those who viewed it as a value-added service had good IT service.<p>I use to do IT consulting and bounced in and out of dozens of companies. Some had no IT support, others had us augment their IT team. The best IT department was at a company where there was about one IT worker for every three employees. A ratio typically unheard of, this company spent greatly on IT as everything had to run smoothly. IT was at an employees desk within a minute if any trouble arouse. They were very profitable of course.<p>The worst companies spent as little as they could on IT. One literally asked me if I could setup their Windows NT 4 box because their Windows 2000 Server was having issues. This was only a few years ago, and they didn't want to buy a new Win 2008 box. Eventually they did, but it was months of pain and plenty of downtime before it happened. Everything else in the company smelled of cheapness too, all in a bad way; Penny wise, dollar foolish.<p>Also, if the IT-to-employee ratio is really low, like 1 per 200 employees, and systems aren't locked-down super tight, IT HelpDesk can constantly be in a position of stress with more requests than it can handle. This is typically the reason for long delays.<p>It's like any service center, really. If you want good service, you have to pay for it. Call up Apple's tech support, and then call up Lenovo's. Both do the same thing. But one is really really good, and the other terrible. Guess who views their tech support as a cost center and who doesn't?

What's that you might ask? It's a special work visa <i>created specifically for Australian nationals</i>. It applies for two years and can be renewed indefinitely.<p>What's more, unlike an H1B visa, it's not subject to quotas and the employer doesn't first need to ""prove"" they couldn't find a suitably qualified domestic worker (a system fraught with abuse that simply acts as a wealth transfer system from companies to immigration lawyers).<p>The problem? When I need to renew it, it may take USCIS <i>months</i>. Plus it's more expensive than applying for a fresh visa. Also, once approved they renew your <i>status</i> not your <i>visa</i>. What does that mean? It means if you leave the country for any reason you don't have a valid visa to re-enter the US so you have to get a new visa anyway.<p>Basically, you need to leave the country every two years to apply for a new one (since you can't apply within the US, of course).<p>What's more, each time I will have to fill out the exact same set of questions (DS-160), make an appointment, give them my passport and wait for it to be returned.<p>Why does this visa exist? Essentially to settle a trade dispute between the US and Australia over wheat. Australia does not subsidize wheat. The US does (as does Europe) to a huge degree, yet Australian wheat is <i>still</i> price competitive but the US keeps Australian wheat out of the US on the flimsy grounds of ""quarantine"" (something Australia complained loudly to the WTO as an artificial restriction of trade for years, which like most things that are not to the US's advantage, it simply ignored). This was eventually settled and the E3 visa was one byproduct of this.<p>But you can see just how screwed up the system is that factors like this cause visas to be created.<p>Others have posted about the whole H1B problem (quotas, etc) and the backlog of green card processing basically allowing employers to treat you like indentured servants. That needs to change.<p>Some argue H1B visas are used to pay substandard wages in lieu of employing domestic workers. The substandard wages bit is true but that's because of the H1B processing problem. The real problem for domestic software engineers at least is that most people who call themselves ""engineers"" or ""programmers"" <i>suck</i>.<p>I've been shocked at some of the people I've interviewed, their inability to code very simple problems and their complete lack of theoretical foundations. <i>And those are the ones that make it past resume screening and phone screens"".<p>The government needs to accept that tech companies are basically the most mobile in the world. Look at big tech companies and you'll see they need data centers, some of which need to be in the US (which really doesn't employ that many people). Everything else can be done from </i>anywhere*. Barriers to entry, kneejerk legislation (eg Sarbanes-Oxley) and software patents are all contributing to driving the future Googles and Facebooks elsewhere.<p>All of this makes me a little sad actually because the US has forgotten it's route. The US is a country of immigrants (IIRC population 2 million in 1800, 50 million in 1900).<p>One of the reasons I've come to New York to work is because I want to see it. New York is the beating heart of commerce and you can see capitalism and commerce in every form here, some pretty, some not-so-pretty.<p>I want to see it before it doesn't exist anymore.<p>My picture of the US is one of decay, rotting from within, collapsing under a mountain of debt and unsustainable policies that will be its downfall.

I for one liked his writing, but apart from that, it seems many famous people are not that great. It just goes to show that by putting yourself out there, you can still win. ",1195170839

Really, if it would cost a person only a few hours to switch to linux, or a couple of minutes of productivity per day, it wouldn't be worth it.<p>But there's the possibility that someone would gain productivity by using linux.

80406,comment,80178,80193,0,0,HiddenBek,,,"SQL is extremely verbose.  During my previous life as a Java programmer I moved a project from raw SQL to the hibernate ORM, and removed 10,000 lines of code in the process.  Using straight SQL, the data access code was more than 50% of the entire code base.  Switching to an ORM got it below 10%.<p>It really depends on what you're doing, but I can't imagine why anyone would want to write SQL by hand.  If you really want simplicity, don't use a database at all.",1195168258

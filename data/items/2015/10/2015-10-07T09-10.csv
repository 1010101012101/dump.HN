The way it was said sounds very fraudulent to me (even for a shell company mill), as if they forged the Seychelles registration docs.

Another large group goes back to India once they have paid house loans, earned enough money, have ailing parents that need help. (India doesn&#x27;t have a social security system.)<p>5. A large group of Indians who end up staying &#x27;abroad&#x27; are from very specific areas of India (5 out of 29 states of India - Punjab and 4 states of southern India).<p>6. People from Punjab suffered a cultural shock during partition of India in 1947 and so they see little value in blind nationalism. Most of them are doing business and are not necessarily highly educated (I mean <i>disproportionately</i>). They accept westernization with open hearts.<p>7. Southern states don&#x27;t appreciate Hindi being promoted by a Delhi based government - imagine Texas where everyone spoke 4 different languages but not English). So they are prone to moving out for prosperity. They are mostly highly educated. Most of the &#x27;talent companies&#x27; like Infosys etc. are being run by them because they generally keep good ties back home. In general no love for westernization. Apu from Simpsons is their caricature.<p>In short - the degree of success for an Indian in America depends on his support structure. Some communities have built it by being quite and bringing over the family, others have embraced westernization. Both require sheer perseverance.

10344949,comment,10344601,10344903,0,0,pron,,,"Modern JITs basically <i>are</i> very sophisticated profile-guided optimizing compilers. Unlike AOT PGOs, though, JITs can adapt to changing program phases, that are common in server applications (e.g. when certain monitoring/troubleshooting/graceful-degradation features are turned on). On the whole, JITs can produce better code.<p>But this, too, is a tradeoff. Some JITs (like JS&#x27;s in the browser) require fast compilation, so some optimizations are ruled out. Very sophisticated optimizations require time, and therefore are often useful when you have tiered compilation (i.e. a fast JIT followed by an optimizing JIT), and tiered compilation is yet another complication that makes JITs hard to implement.",1444209121

But my personal opinion is they need to let the current culture go, and think more about what they want this site to be in 5 years, 10 years, 50 years.<p>What is their vision for social communications for the short, mid, and long-term future? Is it superficial communications and small discussions around niche interests? Or is more like the discussion boards as they existed, for example, in Ender&#x27;s game, where where leaders of the world have serious talks about policy, politics, and philosophy, and invoke real change?<p>I mention the Ender&#x27;s game boards specifically because it seems so easy to start to transition reddit towards something like that. Make karma worth something. Have karma split into types for entertainment vs. insightful commentary, and earn your way onto &quot;serious&quot; boards. Let the current site just be the starting point, but build a new tier above it, of more serious talk. Build your way up into a multi-faceted communication tool that can be taken seriously by all levels of society, while still leaving the light-hearted, superficial nature of its current culture intact for those who want it.<p>I have no idea what the reddit leadership desires... I am sure there are 1000 other directions it can be taken. But they need to pick a direction and start going there. Because right now, the site is growing in numbers, but stagnating by all other metrics.",1444209080

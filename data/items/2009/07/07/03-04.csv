690879,comment,690758,690758,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"For me, the big shift is a contextual one. Advertising has always seemed to come from a 'Take' mentality - 'we are advertising XYZ so we can take money from you'.<p>Product Specials (Sales) as a marketing tool, and then specials (and, now affiliate links etc) through advertising, helped garner attention. They were 'Giving' me a special deal.<p>Viral advertising works largely because it 'Gives' as much as it takes. It 'Gives' humour, for example, or a gaming experience, or (if the morons on my mailing list are to be believed) a bottle of Veuve or some free cell minutes.<p>I can't wait until advertising is fully personal, in a way that AdWords touches upon. When advertisers know my wants and needs, they can Give me the opportunity or motive to buy their product. I win. They win. But most importantly, they focus on me winning first rather than their own needs (clearly within reason), and then benefit in the long term.<p>When that happens, I won't ignore ads - because I know they want to give me something I personally want.<p>How you make that happen is the difference between my day job and you featuring on the cover of Wired.",1246938907

This isn't a question of ""Does SQL Scale or not?"" but ""How much do SQL Databases Scale?""<p>I feel like the propaganda here is that because RDBMS doesn't scale to youtube or google scale they <i>suck</i> and that's not true. Like SQL is a waste of time because at some point, you're going to need to shard your database.<p>Look, at <i>that</i> kind of scale, you're going to have problems with any solution to any problem.  Handling that kind of scale is going to be expensive no matter what solution you implement, whether it's map/reduce or flat files or some other solution.<p>But deciding to build a system from the beginning on something non-relational because someday you may have to accommodate that kind of scale is an example of premature optimization.  The vast majority of features you get with SQL are going to outweigh the limitations of noSQL.<p>I've worked on some pretty high scale systems built on SQL and yes, there are problems, but there's just something irrational going on here and it's off-putting.

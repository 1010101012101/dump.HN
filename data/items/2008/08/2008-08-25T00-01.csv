I mean if Im paying you 450$, I would do little bit of research on your background or your own UI work. 450$ is not much, iff I would expect quality feedback.

285526,comment,285046,285491,0,0,netcan,,,"I went over it again and had a look at the linked paper.<p>The farmer originally had the minimum wage problem. The piece rate needed to keep everyone over minimum wage regardless of skill level or field quality. So<p><pre><code>   (Piece rate) = (Minimum Wage) / (the lowest performer's fruit quantity).   </code></pre>
You can scale incentive on additional output, but it has to go up from there.<p>In this environment, he could probably work out a pay scale that works & it is to his advantage if worker earn more then minimum wage (because he probably pays less for marginal output).<p>Problem was that another productivity factor is the field. So, if he sets the above rate based on the worst field he is over paying workers on the best field. This is where 'generous' comes in. It means they were getting paid for being on a good field not working faster. His solution was scaling based on group productivity.<p>In a perfectly individualistic market, this is a good system . But the workers colluded to work less for the same pay (as opposed to getting paid more).<p>The economist 'fixed' that by removing the group incentive (they call it an externality) to pick less.",1219624574
285525,comment,285046,285491,0,0,dkokelley,,,"<i>Exactly the opposite: ""their wages didn't fall below the legal hourly minimum. Farmer Smith tried to adjust the piece rate each day so that it was always adequate but never generous""</i><p>That was before the economists tried the new payment methods.<p>The entire paragraph, for reference:<p><i>The owner had been paying a piece rate - a rate per kilogram of fruit - but also needed to ensure that whether pickers spent the day on a bountiful field or a sparse one, their wages didn't fall below the legal hourly minimum. Farmer Smith tried to adjust the piece rate each day so that it was always adequate but never generous: The more the work force picked, the lower the piece rate. But his workers were outwitting him by keeping an eye on each other, making sure nobody picked too quickly, and thus collectively slowing down and cranking up the piece rate.</i><p>To summarize, the farmer was paying a modified market rate for the productivity: using minimum wage as the mean to determine the rate to be paid out. The problem was that the workers were the only supply and they were collaborating to lower the output (even in good fields) so that they would work less for the same pay.<p><i>A good analogy for this would be OPEC deciding to lower oil production. The oil supply is there, but by exporting less they do less work and increase the market value by limiting supply.</i><p>After the new methods of payment were introduced, the more productive workers could earn more by being more productive.",1219624421

Except for AT&T trying their level best to forego common carrier status, I don't think any ISP wants to get in the business of discriminating anyone's traffic (every big ISP probably has some subsection of their marketing department that thinks this is a good idea, but the people at the top know where their bread is buttered and shut this stuff down pretty fast).<p>So long as common carrier status is generally recognized, this should legally look no different than an ISP that uses a web cache or web accelerator technology.<p>Everybody has to maintain the perception that they're not building some giant napster-in-the-sky that is going to crush the ?IAAs, but everyone who is doing technical work knows what data goes across the internet and knows the usefulness of this product is relative to what percentage of the peer-peer data it can carry.",1219623232

285512,comment,285193,285385,0,0,sofal,,,"Disclaimer: I don't speak for BYU.<p>I went to BYU. I'm sorry to hear that your friend had that kind of experience. I believe that everyone I went to school with would have considered that very intolerant and rude indeed. I hope that's far from the experience of all students there who aren't LDS.<p>Some of the points in the blurb about BYU are accurate, but some are misleading and false. BYU is a private religious institution, and it therefore has stricter rules about conduct, appearance, and behavior. These rules, together called the ""Honor Code"", are accepted by every student before he/she attends. These standards are a big part of the reason for the students' desire to attend BYU. Abstaining from tea, coffee, tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs is already part of the LDS belief system. The idea that students are required to abstain from flirting is ludicrous, and reveals that the author(s) must either be ignorant or must have misinterpreted their information. There is no end to flirting at BYU, unless you define flirting to include crudity and lewdness. ""Sexual comments"" was an interesting addition to the list. As a student at BYU, you are expected to use clean language and adhere to high moral standards, and so I suppose if by ""sexual comments"" they mean ""vulgar or crass sexual comments"" then this is true. These are all things that may perhaps be labeled as ""intolerant"" by some, but which I agree with.<p>The facial hair rule I think is old-fashioned and unnecessary. I and a lot of others think that blocking YouTube on the campus network is disgusting and verging on communism (I can't stand forced web filtering of any kind). Tunneling worked though, and the CS network didn't block YouTube, so that was nice.",1219623040

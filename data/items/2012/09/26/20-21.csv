In the us educational system I think one of main problems is that you take a lot of subjects you don't need and another is that most subjects are not presented in a problem solving approach manner.<p>It might just be my opinion, but I don't think sociology, anthropology, or even anatomy have any reason for being on a high school curriculum. It seems much more important to me to give students in this age group a really solid understanding of core areas: math, physics, literature / writing (i.e. the analytical thought and expressive process), and foreign languages (for today's world I'd also add computer science). If you know and comprehensively understand the above areas there's nothing stopping a high school student from majoring in any field imaginable.<p>As far as the second area is concerned I think this just has to do with less busy work and more active thought and problem solving engagement. For instance, force students to come up with their own formulas for finding the area of a square BEFORE you show them the formula and steps for sovling the equations. I think this helps engrain knowledge and internalize it, also this is how everything in the real world works anyway, and prepares students for their future career choices.<p>Those are just some of my thoughts...",1348693089

We strongly feel this partnership is great news for you as an existing Twilio developer and something you should be excited about.

The apps in this web portal will grow, which we absolutely believe will be a promising opportunity for our existing community of developers. We'll have more details on this opportunity at Twiliocon (<a href=""http://www.twilio.com/conference"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twilio.com/conference</a>) in a few weeks time.<p>Most importantly though, ACS customers use the same Twilio API you know and love.  The code you have right now will work on AT&T's Advanced Communication Suite, which we hope you'll agree opens up a lot of potential.<p>We are not in the apps business; we are in the platform business.  This and any partnership we engage is about extending the reach of addressable customers <i>you</i> can reach as a developer.<p>Competing with you is not how we win - getting you in front of more and more customers is how we win.",1348692259

I don't necessarily agree with all of it but the main argument is quite sound.<p>Bret writes: ""People understand what they can see."" which is true for some people but not true for all people. I've got one daughter who is very verbal, one very visual. They learn differently. This in a minor nit though, his exploration of the 'code' / 'example' model is good.<p>I particularly liked the commentary on something like:<p><pre><code>   ellipse(60, 50, 50, 100) \n            \   \   \    \\n             \   \   \    +- What does this mean?\n              \   \   +----- Or this,\n               \   +-------- Or this,\n                +----------- Or this?\n</code></pre>\n(We'll see how that comes out in the formatting)<p>TOPS-20 had a really interesting macro language for programming commands, it was the inspiration for a lot of self-describing command line interfaces like the ones made popular on Cisco gear. Basically you could write it like<p><pre><code>   DRAW ellipse AT X=60 Y=50 THAT IS 50 HIGH, 100 WIDE\n</code></pre>\nBut all of the 'fill text' was really unnecessary for the parser so if you wrote:<p><pre><code>   ellipse 60 50 50 100\n</code></pre>\nIt would be just as intelligible. The point being that the training wheels got out of your way when ever you wanted them too, and if you were ever stuck you could type ? and it would tell you what your choices were.<p>Not enough learning environments put this sort of dynamically sizing help into the system where it is needed such that it helps novices and doesn't slow down experts.",1348692143

You're producing hashes irrespective of the result and then matching. IMO the term search would only truly apply if you were reversing the hash mathematically - you'd start with the hash and perform a non-complex operation to find the plaintext.<p>Instead one searches across hashes after compiling a correspondence table, not across plaintexts. I suppose it's a subtle distinction; largely irrelevant to my contention.<p>><i>you inferred it based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem domain</i> //<p>I did not infer it. It was implied. For example,<p>emidln: ""md5 passwords lists are plaintext for modern hardware""<p>So yes, I suppose adding on a few seconds for plaintext recovery was unfair of me, based on a comment like this I should have said ""I note that despite just having to read it back almost as quickly as plaintext ..."".<p>WRT the problem domain. You're discussing an entirely different issue to that which I raised. The start point is simply this:<p>><i>""MD5 is an utterly terrible password hash. It's just about as bad as plaintext.""</i> //<p>That is the pertinent problem domain for my comment. I even went to efforts to emphasise that beyond that atomic claim I was recognising the paucity of md5 for real world password hashing - I don't think one can have used Rainbow tables and not realised that point. Are you really contending still that md5 is almost equivalent to plaintext in terms of string discovery and that there is <i>no</i> exaggeration in that.<p>If the IEEE logs were released with md5 hashed passcodes then other than trivial recognisable cases like 2867-whatever-it-is then one at least has to do work to recover the plaintext.<p>Aside: I'm intrigued why you created a separate account just to press this position.",1348691339
4577845,comment,4575201,4577734,12,0,psykotic,,,"Good luck precomputing all those pairwise shortest paths. Storing the table might not be too bad. But standard algorithms like Floyd-Warshall are O(n^3) in the number of vertices. There are faster algorithms based on fast matrix multiplication but the precomputation time would still be prohibitive. Keeping it up to date would be even worse. The construction of a new highway  could require updating the shortest paths for an enormous number of pairs.<p>The economic argument would go like this: The revenue generated from your maps business is proportional to the number of queries actually processed, not the total number of conceivable queries. The queries processed is such a tiny subset of the possible queries that you want your computational expenses to track the former, not the latter.<p>With a hierarchical shortest paths algorithm, you can still precompute all pairwise shortest paths at the coarser level. For road navigation you might precompute the shortest path between every pair of interstate highway exits in the USA like this paper is doing. In an open-world game like Skyrim you might precompute the shortest paths between all towns and other major hubs and points of interest. That might not yield truly optimal paths. For game use it's close enough and has the benefit of corresponding to how humans naturally navigate.<p>Sidebar: The old Crash Bandicoot games used precomputed shortest paths in a neat way. Their navigation was based on a triangular mesh, so every triangle had up to three edgewise neighbors. Thus for a navmesh with n triangles, they needed lg(3) n(n-1)/2 <= n(n-1) bits to store the table. For convenience they probably stored this in a redundant form requiring 2n^2 bits = n^2/4 bytes. But with only 64KB of additional memory, this still let them support 512 navmesh triangles per level with lightning-fast path finding.",1348691329

I say this in part because I myself learned on Logo before I taught people everything from Java to Scheme, and even the simplest visualization tools could help immeasurably. For example, we had a tool called the Replacement Modeller that would visualize evaluation and substitution in pure-functional Scheme snippets, which was great for stepping through complex code and showing a student what was happening, and it was rocks-and-sticks next to the things Victor is proposing here.<p>I'm interested, though, in what the ramifications are for advanced, complex programming. I am personally a Haskeller, and advanced Haskell regularly deals with incredibly abstract, difficult-to-visualize structures. Monads are infamous in this regard, and monads are embarrassingly trivial next to, say, comonads or iteratees. I have difficulty imagining this sort of model expanded beyond elementary visualization techniques, and certainly cannot imagine how one might represent and interact with these code structures.<p>Victor seems to believe that visual, interactive systems such as these should become standard for <i>all</i> programmers, c.f. the section 'These Are Not Training Wheels.'

Just as being taught the meaning of individual words does not teach you to write, being taught what certain functions or statements do does not teach you to program.<p>What is important is not spelling, but grammar - the shape of a program. His parts on Loops and Functions are better on this - the timeline showing loop instruction order is pretty awesome. However, it's still not perfect. At no point is the user instructed what a 'function' is, and how to use it. How do they know that they should be using it? I agree with other commentators who have suggested that it looks too much like he knows what he is aiming for, and the tool is designed to aid that.<p>In fact, my strongest criticism is in regards to his rebuttal to Alan Perlis:<p>> Alan Perlis wrote, ""To understand a program, you must become both the machine and the program."" This view is a mistake, and it is this widespread and virulent mistake that keeps programming a difficult and obscure art. A person is not a machine, and should not be forced to think like one.<p>I'm sorry Bret, but Alan is right. You <i>do</i> need to be able to think like a machine. Not necessarily an x86 machine, but an abstract turing machine, or a state machine, or a lambda calculus machine. If you cannot think like the machine, you cannot outwit the machine. This is incredible important if you are relying on the machine to give you feedback on what the system is doing.<p>In all his examples, very simple things happen, and never go wrong more than drawing in the wrong place. What happens if he starts causing an infinite loop? Or creates cycles in a linked list (and remember, sometimes he may in fact <i>want</i> cycles).<p>In ""Godel, Escher, Bach"", Douglas Hofstadter suggests that one of the key ingredients for intelligence is being able to go 'up' a level of abstraction. Bret's comment about a circle being made up of small steps, and hence integrating over a differential function, is part of it. A human can recognise that sequential steps with a consistently changing angle can be viewed as a circle. A human can realise that certain relationships are iterative, recursive, self-referential, in a way that (currently) a computer cannot. This is what needs to be taught, and I fear that what Bret has shown here would not help in that element.<p>However, it's still going to be a better intro than anything we have currently, so I think that in regards to getting people to dip in and try, it will be a vast help. I just hope that Bret keeps thinking about bridging the chasm between setting down series' of instructions, and programming.",1348690472

Zero overhead. If you want a slightly smarter list you can use a go slice, which is also pretty low overhead. I've personally verified that if I create a struct in go it takes up the exact same amount of memory as the same c structure.<p>As a concrete example, I recently built an interface to kernel crypto apis using pure go (no cgo). There's no magic to go data structures, you can define structs in go and pass pointers directly to syscalls (through the syscall package) and everything just works. Dealing with large arrays of binary data is similarly straightforward.

Practically you can minimize it's impact by managing your own memory. In fact that's what Brad Fitzpatrick is doing with his go based memcached implementation.<p>It all boils down to how you define systems programming. I guess if you mean is go suitable to write a kernel in, the answer is probably no, (but it would sure be fun to try).

However, if you wish to curry a function foo(a,b), you can do that in the caller (instead of at the function definition itself) by writing:<p>let curried_foo = |b| foo(a,b);<p>That is then stack-allocated and can refer to 'a' in the same frame, and can be passed to other functions you might call from there (but not returned upwards, indeed).",1348690366

4577747,comment,4577469,4577469,1,0,Finbarr,,,"I dislike the approach described where one concatenates every single javascript file into application.js and then tests for the presence of particular dom elements or classes within each file. This taxes the creation of new scripts somewhat as you must ensure you're not accidentally creating a dom element or class which is going to enable some undesired scripts. Another possible option with ""require_tree ."" is to use a framework like <a href=""http://requirejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://requirejs.org/</a> and then use in line script tags within pages to require a particular module.<p>I also think it's a bad idea to enable asset compilation in production. From the Rails asset guides (<a href=""http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#live-compilation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#live-compi...</a>):<p>""This mode uses more memory, performs more poorly than the default and is not recommended.""<p>My advice would be to use application.js to concatenate scripts you're highly likely to use on every page, e.g., jquery, bootstrap, etc. Then organize the rest of your page specific scripts into app/assets/javascripts/<controller>/<action>.js<.extensions> and add a `javascript_include_tag ""#{params[:controller]}/#{params[:action]}` in any views that rely on page specific scripts (within a content_for(:head) block). This way you'll likely have 2 local scripts loading for each page - the application.js file and any page specific script. The upsides are that you don't need to worry about undesired javascript running, the application.js file will be cached and reused across all pages, and your lightweight page specific js file will be served the first time a user loads the page then cached with every subsequent visit. The potential downside is that you either need to specify a precompile array by hand in your environment specific config file or automatically glob files to be precompiled.<p>Note that you can also use the manifest declarations inside of your regular javascript files, e.g., `//= require 'backbone'` at the top of one of your page specific javascript files.",1348690149
4577746,comment,4576918,4577171,2,0,bathat,,,"I don't think anyone minds that Apple is competing.  I've been fiercely critical of the new iOS 6 maps, and I welcome competition.  I can't speak for others, but what bothers me is not that Apple released a different mapping solution, but that the new map app is just so unbelievably terrible for many people [1].  Even with the third-party add-ons, you still can't use Apple maps to plan an inter-city itinerary, or one that crosses the ""territory"" of multiple transit agencies.  In some American cities, that means you can't use iOS 6 maps to plan a trip across town.  These are things that <i>did</i> work in iOS 5.<p>I completely understand how it makes business sense for Apple to develop it's own mapping product, but that doesn't mean that they have to release software that is missing huge chunks of functionality.  There seems to be this false dichotomy that Apple had two options: ""release a product that is nowhere near ready to ship,"" and ""rely on Google forever.""  There is a third option, which is ""develop maps secretly, do the first two 90%'s of the work, <i>then</i> drop Google maps.""  Many on HN have argued that maps can't improve until they are used.  That is doubtlessly true for <i>some</i> aspects: POIs, especially businesses, aren't going to be added until Apple maps gain mind-share, and there will be errors in the data that Apple bought until someone bothers to tell Apple to correct it.  I can forgive Apple for that.  But those are the things belong to the third 90% of the work.<p>If anything, this piece at Daring Fireball just reinforces the idea that Apple has a problem somewhere in the chain of command.  It really seems like there's nothing that would have prevented Apple from waiting another 6 to 12 months to announce it's mapping product, except that someone drastically underestimated how difficult it would be to compete with Google.  Frankly, I think that's <i>why</i> iOS 6 doesn't have transit directions--the only thing you can do with a late product is drop features or push back the ship date.[2]<p>I really do welcome all the things that Apple is <i>trying</i> to do maps in iOS 6, and I think they will have a good product in a year's time (or maybe two).  That does <i>not</i>, however, mean that I want or will accept broken maps on my phone in the interim.<p>[1] Apparently this is everyone in Japan, a dude in Portugal, and many people who use public transit to get around in big American cities.  For some, the addition of turn-by-turn is a bigger gain than the loss of public transit and street-view.<p>[2] This is also why I can't see the third-party transit thing as a viable solution.  The end-game is that Apple will bring transit in-house the same way they did with the rest of maps. Actually, maybe it's a brilliant strategy on Apple's part to pick really good team to do transit directions.  Embark seems to be doing a good job, but they seem to be focusing on just a few transit systems in big cities, with no inter-city transit.  Hopefully Apple will acquire them and provide the resources to have really complete coverage.",1348690149

Remember Microsoft is trying and going nowhere - their upgrades are still a fiasco - despite having a limited set of devices. It is simply not possible for Google to update those hundreds of SKUs out there to the latest version, all at once. The only way they could do that is by limiting hardware choices. People don't seem to like that.<p>There are rumors that Google will have as many as 5 manufacturers build a Nexus line that they will sell like they do the Galaxy Nexus today. May be that's as close as we will ever get to regular updates for a variety of hardware.",1348689693

4577689,comment,4577153,4577153,5,0,james4k,,,"Three different types of pointers? Perhaps that is going a bit far?<p>> If you've a sharp eye, you're wondering what that ""~"" is that I snuck in on the type of the closure for the child task. That's actually a pointer type, of which Rust has three (none of which can be null, by the way):<p>> ~T is a unique pointer to a T. It points to memory allocated in the send heap, which means data inside of unique pointers can be sent between tasks. You can copy unique pointers, but only by deeply copying (otherwise they wouldn't be unique!) (and by default, they are ""non-implicitly-copyable"", so the compiler will issue warnings if you copy them without writing the ""copy"" keyword).<p>> @T is a managed pointer to a T. Currently, these are reference-counted and cycle-collected (they may be full-on GCed in the future). Copying one increments the reference count, so multiple managed pointers can point to the same data. These are allocated on a per-task private heap, and cannot be sent between tasks.<p>> &T is a borrowed pointer to a T. It can point to the inside of arbitrary data structures - on the stack, inside ~ or @ pointers, etc. Rust has a static analysis, called the ""borrow checker"", that ensures that borrowed pointers must not outlive the scope of the pointed-to data (i.e., it is impossible for rust programs to have a use-after-free).",1348689616

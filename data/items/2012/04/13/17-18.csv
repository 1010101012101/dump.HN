When I write code, I <i>like</i> to write it open-source. Setting the obviously negative connotation aside, it is objectively true that the GPL code, compiled or no, is a license virus that spreads so fundamentally that linking with non-GPL-compatible code violates the terms. Because the distinction between client and server code is blurred, this makes the territory murky and introduces overhead into the developer's mind as to whether what is being written can ever be open-sourced or not.<p>---<p>Besides dampening enthusiasm for using Meteor, this can also reduce the quality and usefulness of modules being released. This sounds counter-intuitive, but consider the following hypotheticals:<p>Company A develops and maintains a production-ready module that is especially useful for anyone using Meteor. However, the legal department says that the company cannot release software under GPLv3 (this <i>is</i> common). Company B and Person Z want to use it, the former with a commercial license, the latter with a open-source license.<p>Because Company A cannot release the module under a permissive license, they can 1) Release it permissively but in a GPL-incompatible license, thus banning all Person Z's from developing open-source software with it legally, 2) Opt not to release it at all to Person Z, and just license it to Company B. 3) Abandon Meteor for something they can both release openly (to give back and get more eyes and hands) and develop in-house.<p>Company C uses a closed-source library, because they're required to use it because it's the only one out there, and they're contractually obligated because that's the business they're in. They use Meteor to get the project off the ground and they never move off, because it's what they know and are good at. Company C can <i>never</i> write, for example, a white-label platform to distribute to Company X and Company Y, because at best they could only distribute the platform sans non-GPL parts. And while the licensing is viral, the understanding of it will not be. So it may lead to GPL violations down the road because Company X didn't understand, and Company C may be holding the bag. Legal doesn't want the company to take the risk and assume liability, so it says ""no"" and kills the project's use of Meteor.<p>Company D thinks about the hypothetical case of Company C, only it was just founded and is looking at Meteor. Maybe it was founded by Person Z. Because of the hypothetical of Company C, and because Company D doesn't know what their business is yet, they decide to avoid a potential future nightmare and write their own framework. Maybe they open-source it, because it's compelling and useful, and they want to get as many eyeballs and hands on it as they can, improving it.<p>---<p>tl;dr I was super-excited about Meteor, but now that it's GPL I will not be touching it with a ten foot pole. I am <i>really</i> sad about this.<p>Because I value developer freedom, I do not use GPL'd code in my projects, even if it is objectively good. Because I support open-source, and want to give back when I can I do not want use Meteor with a commercial license. So because of your choice of license - and for no other reason - I can not and will not use Meteor.",1334339820

This is because game devs think about file access and make sure that it is optimized. It would be nice to just get something like eclipse that takes 5 minutes to become usable and slows down all the time because it is hitting the file system without any regard for performance.<p>Due to a jar locking problem I'm having to restart eclipse several times a day and it is so painful watching it ""build"" and validate all this code when my real build happens on the command line.<p>I wish video game developers would start writing IDEs for other reasons like graphics as well.

3837830,comment,3836978,3837455,4,0,drostie,,,"Spreadsheets would be nicer if they had a coherent dataflow model. Some spreadsheet programs do this automatically, but it could be a great place for a visual programming language too.<p>One ugly pattern that I'm often doing is to set a column with values by the function ""A3=A2"" and dragging that down. This gives a column of constant values which are tweakable by tweaking just the first element. That's what a scalar variable looks like in a spreadsheet. I'd like a separate calculation area where I could refer to these. Also when I select a column I might right-click and choose ""Reduce  Mean"", and the mean of that column could appear in the scalar area too. With some visual tinkering you might even have a sort of ""iframe"" containing the columns and the scalars at the bottom of the page, and have the mean appear underneath the column to remind me what it's the mean of -- but it should float; I shouldn't have to move it when I want to drag-down the calculation to enter in a few more rows.<p>With spreadsheet logic you have a couple of atomic operations like, ""this is a fixed column specified by me,"" or ""this is a column containing every half-int from 12.5 through 28.5"" and so on. You have reductions of those list types, like Mean and Sum and Length. You have transformations of the data too, like NormalDist(x, mean, stdev). And some of them are cached-recursive, e.g. the running-sum function you might use to find a balance given a transaction history:<p><pre><code>    balance[-1] = 0\n    balance[i] = change[i] + balance[i - 1]\n</code></pre>\nFinally you've got a wide variety of visualizations of that data, which might also be linked from the ""scalar area"" -- in fact it might be nice to develop ultrasmall ""thumbnail versions"" that update dynamically as the data updates.<p>I think those elements are sort of the ""core"" of a spreadsheet and are handled woefully inadequately by Excel, which was not originally designed for the popular usage case it has become.",1334338337

Hopefully they are flexible enough to have reasonable negotiations even though your business plan is not yet fixed in stone.

His authorized agents were able to get a copy of each new chapter and have it on a boat to America while unauthorized copiers had to wait for the British publication, and then make copies from that.<p>By the time the copiers did that, and were able to get their copies to America, the authorized copy was already here, and most people who wanted to buy had already bought an authorized copy.<p>Even for works not in serial form, the authorized release had a big advantage, at least if the author was well known. Most sales occurred fairly soon after publication, and by the time copiers could buy a copy, and get it typeset (remember--this was all done by hand back then!) there weren't a lot of buyers left.<p>Stephen Breyer, who later went on to become a Justice of the Supreme Court, wrote a famous law review article called ""The Uneasy Case for Copyright"" where he argued that copyright might be unnecessary because of the market advantage from being first that the author's authorized edition gets.

Can't wait to try it out.<p>Mind if I share a couple ideas that might not be hard to implement with what you've got?<p>1) It would be nice to see \aggregate information about what has happened in function calls.  The simplest would be: while the code is running, put and update a bar graph next to each function to show, proportionally to others, how many times it has been called so far.<p>2) More generally: record and associate with a function \all the inputs and outputs it has had.  (Other commenters talked about having ""context"").  Then the programmer can scroll through these lists, calculate statistics for them if they are numbers, or choose one of them to plug into the function.  (Often when you are refactoring code, some function lower in the code path gets 'orphaned'----it took some kind of complex input you don't want to bother putting in by hand, and so now if you want to modify it you're deterred.  If you had prior inputs, you could just 'wire it up' with one of those.)<p>3) Commenters talked about having different fonts.  I think the \one area where this would be helpful in Lisp is with the parentheses.  I've shared prior versions of this idea before, but what I think would be helpful is to vary both \color and \size of parentheses.  You pick three or four colors, say red, blue, and black (more than that is hard to tell apart in context, especially with syntax coloring), and once you've varied that, you bump the size up.  So if you had seven parentheses in sequence, there would be three sizes, with the outermost three the largest, the next three medium, etc.",1334336799

The underlying argument is that ""understanding"" is a fundamentally and exclusively human property (this will not be fully rebutted until we discover in full the processes underlying learning and memory in humans)<p>Granted, a huge list of syntactic rules will probably not result to any useful intelligence, but a brain simulator would be  exactly equivalent to a human (and Searle's response to that argument is completely unfounded)",1334336697

In fact, one could argue based on this point that all of U.S. copyright law is being applied incorrectly; the Copyright Clause, sometimes more accurately described as the Progress Clause, of the Constitution gives Congress the ability:<p>""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.""<p>In what way is a programming language a writing or discovery?

We hoped to spur a discussion about new ways to build apps that dramatically changes the skill sets required and the time it takes. We look at Meteor as part of an exciting transition from LAMP to a new architecture of rich client applications (see also <a href=""http://www.firebase.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.firebase.com/</a> that launched yesterday!).<p>That's still the main focus for now. Hundreds of developers have deployed apps to meteor.com. We've got pull requests for new features to sort out, and many technical questions to answer. There's a whole buffer of screencast ideas we want to do.<p>The four of us are a company. We intend to make money while committing ourselves to an open-source strategy. We want to see great software -- not just ours -- be something developers can sell. So while we'll give away much of what we build, we'll also look for places where developers who gain benefit from Meteor can give something back.<p>We did not expect such strong interest in writing closed source commercial apps this quickly on the platform. It's clearly something we have to sort out faster than we thought, and we will. For now our offer stands: please just write us if you need a commercial license for a closed source project and we will find a way to accommodate your needs. I'd imagine over the next couple weeks we'll have more concrete things to say.",1334336415

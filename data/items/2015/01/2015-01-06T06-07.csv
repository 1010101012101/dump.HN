8843188,comment,8836398,8837823,0,0,_delirium,,,"I can see immigration authorities getting peeved over people who are essentially running a freelance business from the country (hence cracking down on coworking spaces). That looks more like working in the country rather than really working back home: even if all your customers are abroad, the place of your self-employment as a freelancer is where you customarily actually reside and do the work. So if you maintain an office much of the year in Thailand and don&#x27;t maintain one in the U.S., that sure looks like you&#x27;re working in Thailand.<p>But most countries don&#x27;t categorically exclude doing work for a foreign employer while on a visa-free visit. The U.S. visa-waiver program explicitly allows &quot;travel for business or pleasure&quot; up to 90 days, and the EU has an analogous &quot;business travel&quot; exemption. Doing work for your normal &quot;home&quot; employer is expected under the definition of &quot;business travel&quot;, which can and usually does include on-site work in the country (not only remote work for your home office). That&#x27;s what the business travel visa exemption is largely intended to facilitate: things like BP London sending staff to Houston for 3 weeks to supervise plant startup, or Microsoft sending some staff from Redmond to Ireland to hash out a product design in person. As long as it&#x27;s temporary (typically <90 days) and the employee continues to be employed normally by the home office (not paid by the local office), it doesn&#x27;t have to be confined to training or conferences, and can include actual work.",1420526166

Also, anything we say might not get us in trouble today, but since it&#x27;s hard to predict what the future holds -- laws may become harsher for example --, it might indeed get us in trouble two or even five years from now, (possibly after it no longer represents our current opinions even) since it&#x27;s all recorded.<p>About China I agree, and think they and other similar nations stayed competitive because they have where to &#x27;borrow&#x27; innovation from (i.e. the freer nations).

I have often wondered about the psychological effects of being effectively stranded on a barren, lifeless planet potentially for the rest of your life. On Earth, we can &quot;get away from it all&quot; and go to the country, go camping near a nice stream, listen to birds sing, go for a swim in the ocean, sit in a nice garden and eat our lunch, and so forth. How would one cope with the loss of all of that, not to mention also having to deal with the long-term physiological effects of a change in gravity?",1420525237

Why should a 45 minute service of a $100 meal mandate a larger tip than the same 45 minute service of a $50 meal? The staff has put in the same amount of time and effort to serve both meals... yet the more expensive meal expects a larger tip. This aspect makes no sense whatsoever. A tip should be based on the number of clients served at a table + the time spent in the restaurant + perhaps additional money for special requests or complex meals.<p>If anything, you&#x27;d think the cheaper meal should have a larger tip since you&#x27;re occupying a spot for a cheap meal when they could have had a client sit down and spend 3x as much as you.

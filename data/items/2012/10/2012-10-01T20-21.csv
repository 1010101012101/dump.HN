4599299,comment,4596964,4599173,2,0,rbellio,,,"I just want to say that I think it's great that you're impassioned about this topic.  I'm definitely not trying to discourage you from it.  My reticence comes more from the fact that this is such a complicated topic for me.<p>On one hand, I'm all for supporting the goals and opportunities of all individuals equally.  When it requires special interest in certain groups though, I sometimes worry that it will create a larger divide.  Sexual identity has such a huge impact on us during our developmental stages.  The pressures of it don't just stem from adults, but from peers and school as well.  I'm of the opinion that rather than singling out individuals by sex, it would be more valuable to expose all of them to it.<p>This is anecdotal, but I have a personal experience with a program that encouraged more adoption of specific fields by females in my classes.  In middle school, a large number of girls were separated from the regular classes to attend special math and science classes.  These girls were provided a more in-depth education when it came to mathematics and were given more support in learning the material.  It really irked me, especially at that young age.  I couldn't understand why these girls were being singled out for certain topics and why I couldn't be involved with them simply because I was a boy.  I can't speak to the effectiveness of this program.  I do know that a large percentage of these girls ended up in my high school math and science classes which regularly had a nearly 50/50 split, but again, that's not evidence that the program worked.<p>What it did do, though, was make me realize that I was not an equal.  It was probably my first realization that not everyone was treated equally and that there was really no rhyme or reason to why.  I saw similar things throughout my years in school, but this one affected me the most.  When I hear about the professional female organizations that go to schools and encourage girls specifically to pursue careers in mathematics or engineering, I cringe.  I want equality, but I don't know how inequality gets us there.",1349125064

4599297,comment,4599129,4599178,8,0,drgath,,,"Where is the guarantee that developers will -never- get screwed by App.net? Especially since the barrier to entry is $100? The DIP is a nice addition that will help those with solid ideas out of the gate, but they are still greatly restricting the developer pool by a pay-to-play model.  Along with that, I still have seen no compelling reason to pay $5/month to be a member of a social network where there are sub-20k users who (I assume?) barely use the service.<p>App.net is just capitalizing on those annoyed with Facebook/Twitter developer policies.  Great for their bank account and a really smart idea, but I still don't see value for anyone else.  As someone else once said, ""App.net is a social network for people who have $50 to show-off that they have $50 to blow.""  That's not a party I feel compelled to attend.<p>I'm open to a convincing argument though.",1349125033

Great for those die-hard early adopters (probably the people after whom Dalton was chasing), but terrible for the everyday Twitter user who is tired of the horrific signal-to-noise ratio on that service.<p>That said, my opinion would be that $24/year would be even better for an annual subscription. $2/mo is a lot of money for a ""Twitter clone,"" but is cheap enough that it would be easy to convince your friends or colleagues to sign up. $36 <i>might</i> have hit the price point that I'll give it a shot as a (relatively) early adopter, but I'm not sure. $5/month, almost double the annual subscription fee, is too much for a thirty day trial run.<p>I'm one of the (few?) believers that app.net can really take off. I've tried Twitter, and while I'm relatively active, I can't help but feel that I'm lost in the oft-cited ""echo chamber."" I'm looking for a service with Twitter-like abilities, strong interaction and an intelligent community, and I think app.net will (someday) be it.<p>Congrats to Dalton for lowering the price in what <i>must</i> lead to hugely increased participation.",1349124628

We hit peak reserves in 1980--ever since then the rate of new discovery has been less than the rate of extraction. When it sinks in that we're going to run out of oil, why wouldn't prices skyrocket?

Slow and bloated are the most common adjectives thrown around (Outlook, Thunderbird), and if not that, then there's the weird UI's (Eudora, The Bat) - and then there's the terminal clients, while very nice, very fast, very functional, completely ignore all progress made in user interfaces over the past 20 years.

Arguably I'd say it's a bad way to do it, much as you can find really bad engineering practice, in which case I agree with you: bad practice is bad practice. :) People complain about how hard it is to hire good developers, and this goes double or even triple for people in the test industry, frankly.<p>So much depends on what the project actually needs. If developers are doing a great job of handling QA-related issues themselves, great. But sometimes you need someone to help you clear out technical debt, rig up some test infrastructure, help refine a release process, etc. And sometimes the risk of regression is so high and the product is so big that you <i>do</i> need an army of testers.<p>Likewise, for any sufficiently large project, having a dedicated person who keeps an eye on the big picture -- a clean & accurate bug DB; tracking customer reports/issues; finding & narrowing bugs -- can be an asset. This goes double when the tester's job is to be a product expert, and when the tester is reasonably technical.<p>And yes testers should be more or less embedded with developers. ""Throw it over the wall"" is invariably a terrible way to handle releases. Testers should exist to enable deploy early, deploy often, not to inhibit it. And so on.

4599060,comment,4598089,4598089,10,0,mistercow,,,"There are other reasons, though, that a rational approximation can be useful. If you're doing mental arithmetic, for example, multiplying by a fraction can be easier than multiplying by a decimal, but this depends on the specific numerator and denominator. In this way, 22/7 fails horribly, because multiplying by 22 and dividing by 7 are not particularly easy operations.<p>For example, 100/32 is a less accurate representation than 22/7, but it is far easier to multiply, since you can do so with only two mental registers. In fact it also takes fewer registers to multiply than 3.1 (which is also less accurate than 100/32). However, it does require more mental operations than 3.1; 100/32 takes five halvings and a decimal shift, while 3.1 requires multiplication-by-3, a decimal shift, and an addition.<p>What would be really cool would be an analysis similar to the one in the article that used a model of mental computation to find the best tradeoff for working numbers in your head.<p>That said, for mental calculations you're probably better off just pretending that pi = 3, unless you're just trying to impress someone.",1349121727

For your example, I know 7^2=49 immediately, which I round to 50, 50 * 3=150 which is fairly close to 153.938. (Use more digits of pi!) I can quickly improve my estimate by adding 4.9. (Edit: It's also fairly trivial to get even better estimates quickly from here, but at this point it's probably faster to grab a cell phone / [favorite language] repl. From 154.9, subtract the additional 3 gained from using 50 instead of 49, now 151.9, add 4.9/2~=2.4, now 154.3, subtract 4.9 * 10% ~= .5, 153.8.)",1349121627

Salesforce is a hugely profitable company but they make a low rate product. The vast majority of their users hate the product that they're forced to use. At Streak - we're building a product that people love to use. Even though we sell to businesses, we aren't an enterprise company - we're a technology company maniacally focused on a great product.</i><p>Thumbs down.",1349121618

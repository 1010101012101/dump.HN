I would bet that the 10% tip average pre-card machine is actually low based on undeclared cash tips, and having tax taken on a full 22% will drop the net significantly.

HTTP is <i>not</i> a request/response protocol. It certainly once was back in HTTP/1.0, but with pipelining and reusing connections and now websockets (and soon SPDY's server push/hint), it's a streaming protocol that has a common use case where it is used for request/response, and that requires a completely, <i>completely</i> different API than a protocol that is truly request/response. It is a lot easier to build a streaming base that has a special case for request/response than it is to build a request/response base and then hack in bizarre conceptually-impure bullshit for streaming, but every web framework I can find is the latter, if indeed they don't simply punt entirely on streaming because they've written it so thoroughly out of the API. (I'm vaguely aware of some that are actually sensible but all in languages I don't know and haven't gotten to yet, so I'm not sure if they really are built on a sensible base or if it merely raises the bizarre crap to API-blessed status.)",1336917127
3966994,comment,3966187,3966826,3,0,jimktrains2,,,"""In the case of a bullet fired at sufficiently close to a vertical angle to result in a non-ballistic trajectory, the bullet would tumble, lose its spin, and fall at a much slower speed due to terminal velocity and is therefore rendered less than lethal on impact (the Busted rating). However, if a bullet is fired at a lower angle allowing for a ballistic trajectory (a far more likely case), it will maintain its spin and will retain enough energy to be lethal on impact (the Plausible rating). Because of this potentiality, firing a gun into the air is illegal in most U.S. states, and even in the states where it is legal, it is not recommended by the police. Also the MythBusters were able to identify two people who had been injured by falling bullets (fired from approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) away, and hence at a lower angle), one of them fatally (the Confirmed rating).

I actually surprisingly was invited to the last investor meeting that the startup that I work for was involved in.  All 3 of us sat there, and I have a feeling the reason why I was invited is because I'm the stereotypical ""programmer"" in how I dress, I have a slight beard, sort of unkempt.  My guess is that they figure the chances of getting funded are better with me there, than with me not there.<p>The investor kindly pointed out some very important facts about how our registration process and our product that I had very much agreed with him on and had voiced these concerns and opinions PRIOR to the meeting and they were ignored.  The registration process on our site takes about 3-4 minutes before a user can get into the app, and I had been saying all along that no user in their right mind is going to wait that long, the investor 100% was on the ball with this one, the product guy did not agree, based on our tester feedback this supposedly wasn't an issue (all testers are in some way connected to the co-founders though, relatives + friends).  When was the last time the user knew what they wanted though?  Sometimes you need to know what's best for your users and making them wait 4 minutes for a product when they're not sure what it does, is definitely a lesson in futility.  Me being involved in web development since I was in middle school, I knew 100% the investor was going to bring that up and I'm glad he did, but we've still continued to ignore that sentiment which I believe is a mistake",1336917090

The saying ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" comes to mind.  We can't be good at everything, so let's focus on 2 or 3 things that will have the MOST IMPACT and that we can be REALLY GOOD at to get CONSUMERS HAPPY about our product.

But we can agree to disagree.<p>Regarding your bicycle metaphor: just as a balloon releases gas into its surroundings, a bicycle - when we stop adding to its kinetic energy - transfers energy from itself to its surroundings until it stops. I think it's largely irrelevant whether we use the release of a physical substance or energy as a metaphor, but whatever works for you.<p>I also realize that I missed an important point in my previous post, which is gaining the ability to stop thinking when thinking isn't needed. This is basically the development of an awareness of thought activity. Since, as you correctly say, thoughts create emotions and vice verse, releasing emotional energy will not work if you keep creating new emotional energy through unconscious thinking. But this is really an integrated part of the release of emotions; the two things happen simultaneously. Indeed, some emotions cannot even be released/experienced until you become conscious of the previously unconscious thought patterns that held them back.<p>> The correct analogy is not of a balloon releasing gas, but a bicycle slowing down.<p>I guess part of my point was that just as the bicycle wheel doesn't stop immediately after we stop propelling it, emotions don't disappear immediately either even if thought activity subsides completely. There is an inertia left that can make us experience emotions related to an incident long after it has happened (even with no thought present).

3966894,comment,3966666,3966869,6,0,PaulHoule,,,"Trying to over-abstract network communication is one of the classic mistakes in distributed system design.<p>Remember the old ""RPC"" idea from the 1980's?  Despite a huge amount of effort to optimize remote procedure calls,  nobody could ever get an RPC to be within orders of magnitude of a real procedure call in speed.<p>The RPC concept only became mainstream in the 2000's when people had given up on performance;  SOAP and POX systems use inefficient XML and JSON serializations and are integrated into http stacks that were designed to use something else.  These systems flourished in the 2000's because interoperability,  not performance,  was the driver.<p>Now,  if you're in an AJAX, Flex or Silverlight environment,  you've got the whole asynchronous communications issue -- you can't paper that over with an abstraction layer,  you've got to build the whole application around the fact of async comm if you want to build something that really works.",1336914773

Poor reporting by a relatively inexperienced writer (who happens to be from NYC, which may explain his stance).<p>Finally, this story really has zero bearing on anything HN related, other than the fact that it throws around a little statistical trivia.

These prevention tactics tell me, the consumer, that this company believes it cannot compete on any level with the ease and availability of pirating content.  If they stop all pirating everywhere, will it force me to buy content through their (less than amazing services)? Maybe a little.  Is it possible to stop all pirating everywhere? I doubt it.<p>In other words, where is the ""piracy killer"" service that is so awesome, I give someone my money and stop pirating?  Hulu? Load of crap.  Netflix? It's okay, I guess.  Steam?

They call in armed police when needed, but this seems to often result in delays in pursuing criminals and sometimes escalation where armed criminals are given the time to take hostages and/or barricade themselves in.<p>On the other hand, when seeing some recent encounters with these beat cops, I was glad they weren't armed.

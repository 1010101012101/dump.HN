Two macroscopic objects, like a human and a cup of coffee, at room temperature, entangled? Give me a break. We have to go trough a hell of a lot of trouble to create entangled pairs of photons to do experiments with. Interactions with the environment break the entanglement, which is exactly what we are doing all the time.<p><i>Maccone's solution is to suggest that in fact entropy-decreasing events occur all the time</i><p>Of course they do. The point is those fluctuation in the 'wrong' direction last an extremely short period of time.

789879,comment,789517,789763,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"There's been no scientficially-verifiable studies done on the actual behavioural effects of toxoplasmosis, either on people as a whole or on individual sexes. The behaviours most commonly noted in infected people is decreased jealousy in males and decreased frigidity in females; anything beyond these are largely debated and are essentially wild speculation.<p>The biggest medical concern for infection is in women, no evidence has been shown that pregnancy will reactivate latent toxoplasmosis and allow it to become acute. If a woman is infected with toxoplasmosis it is safer to leave her untreated until she will no longer have children (around 50 years naturally, younger if her tubes are tied). Infection with toxoplasmosis when pregnant is exceptionally dangerous to the child (blindness and brain damage are exceptionally common, brain death can occur shortly after birth in many cases), but also very dangerous to the mother due to a suppressed immune system, which can start with flu-like symptoms and quickly progress to encephalitis.<p>Treatment in males could be performed at any time, however the course of drugs for latent toxoplasmosis are either exceptionally strong, or exceptionally long term and both are far more harmful than the infection. Not to mention that if the infection isn't completely removed it may become acute, potentially causing eye damage and nasal lesions, possibly a loss of smell. The bigger problem if the infection becomes acute is that the hosts immune system has usually been somewhat compromised by the medications.<p>There's also little proof of an immune resistance to toxoplasmosis and a person who has already been infected is highly likely to be reinfected, it is far more common to contract through your diet than your pet cat (prevalence in France is near 90%, but is near 5% in South Korea despite cat ownership averaging in the 20-40% around the world). This not only means you'll have to be retreated for the same exceptionally benign disease, but it increases your chances of acute infection.<p>I'm sure a magical cure all of toxoplasmosis would undoubtedly do good, but it's prevalent everywhere in the environment, and despite animals being treated with medications to prevent toxoplasmosis, food is the number one way to contract it. You would have to treat a few billion humans and animals, including vermin and hope none will become drug resistant.<p>Acute toxoplasmosis shows no signs of drug resistance, however latent toxoplasmosis already shows signs of drug resistant strains despite treatment barely being performed except in rare cases (Rh-negatives allegedly suffer decreased reaction time, which is dangerous for drivers, especially when already tired).<p>I have no references for non-treatment toxoplasmosis treatment being safer, that's just common sense when populations like France are near 90% infected and show lower violence rates than lower infected populations like Britain (22%) despite the infection allegedly increasing violence amongst males. The statistics would appear to be contradictory to some of the assumptions made by doctors.<p>What this really needs is an actual long-term behavioural study, but until then we have wild speculation with zero scientific basis and all appears to be contrary to current observable statistics.",1251402488

789850,comment,789801,789801,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been through the CMS selection process five times now, and it's always turned out bad, until the most recent selection.  I've heavily used (as in, built and launched a site used by thousands of people every day) Zope, Plone, OpenACS, Joomla, and now Drupal, and experimented with (as in, installed and tinkered with for a few days just to get a feel for) a half dozen others.  I <i>think</i> Drupal is actually going to work for us for years to come; while every other CMS I've ever launched a site on has immediately shown itself to be really problematic once it was being used by a lot of people.  It is the least frustrating, the best supported by its community, the most actively developed by competent developers (Joomla seems to have a lot more third party developers, but they seem to predominantly be web designers turned developer, and their inexperience shows in the extremely poor quality of most modules for Joomla).  We've had it in service for a couple of months now, and I spent a lot more time evaluating and developing for it before choosing it than any other CMS I've deployed, and its flaws are the least offensive and the easiest to fix or workaround of any of the ones I've used, so far.<p>Ubercart is the nicest to customize and extend of any of the CMS shopping carts I've used, and also seems to be developed and maintained by competent, friendly people.<p>Getting commercial support for the code from competent core developers has also proven much easier than for any of the other CMS I've used (with the possible exception of Zope/Plone; the Zope people are top-notch and fantastic to work with, though not cheap, and I found I needed help a lot more than I liked because the docs were out of date and inaccurate and they've reinvented every wheel so existing knowledge, like of relational databases, doesn't map to Zope/Plone).<p>Anyway, our new site is also the hardest working of any CMS-based site I've ever built.  It is expected to do more: forums, ticket tracker, ecommerce with quite a lot of customization for license management, documentation, extensive and heavily used email notifications (we send thousands of notification emails every single day, and while it's not perfect, Drupal is the most flexible and generic of all of the notification systems I've used).<p>It's probably worth mentioning that I don't like PHP as a language (I would choose Perl, Python, Ruby, or pretty much anything else, over PHP, if I were only selecting based on the implementation language).  Despite that, Drupal is what I selected.  I guess that's a pretty ringing endorsement.<p>I'm not even going to try to tell you what to do on question 2.",1251401577

For the longest time, portraits were in many ways symbolic and metaphorical. Features would be highlighted, added, or exaggerated to make a statement. Not to mention the staging of the whole thing.<p>Think about that famous painting of the scarily-dressed, hook-nosed man and the pregnant woman. It is a painting depicting a wedding, and yet the woman is comically pregnant. I've read quite a bit about this painting, tho its name escapes me -- and everything seems to argue that not only is her pregnancy purely symbolic (fruitful), but so is much of the rest of the setting. It is notable also because there is a convex mirror behind them, showing their backs and the room.

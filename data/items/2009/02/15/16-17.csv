482069,comment,481777,481826,0,0,kcy,,,"I'm an HBS'er who has also started 3 companies over the past few years (including one while at HBS).  I'd say HBS <i>definitely</i> emphasizes supporting entrepreneurship, but it's not the way that you'd expect.   HBS is a great place to start a company not so much because you learn about entrepreneurship in the classes as much as the place is so well setup as a platform to support people starting companies.<p>Yes, HBS is all about the case method for its classes.  It's actually a great way to learn.  It is very time consuming, all-encompassing, and incredibly powerful if you commit yourself to it rather than blow it off the way many post-consulting, post-finance students may.  The case studies will give you some tools that are really helpful in organizing a business, but they will not show you how to do it.  The only way to learn how to start a company (in my opinion) is to actually do it yourself.  The reason HBS is a great place to start a company is that you have access to all of Harvard, MIT, Babson, Boston University, several world-class hospitals, and many venture capitalists in the Boston area.  HBS offers a protected time where you can get successful entrepreneurs (your professors, case protagonists who come in, classmates, etc) to help you come up with ideas, get in contact with people, and create something of enduring value.  You are surrounded by classmates from any industry you could imagine who are connected at the very top who are excited to just have lunch and talk about whatever you want to talk about.<p>While it's true that many people out of HBS go to work at a company, the statistics show that more than 50% of HBS graduates ultimately do start their own companies, often only a couple years after leaving HBS.  If you look at the sorts of companies they start there are <i>many</i> really great companies, not just random me-too sorts of small tech companies based on relatively thin IP.<p>I think it's really easy to dismiss a place like HBS as a place that just churns out consultants and crappy I-bankers.  In all honesty I looked at HBS, and MBA programs in general, like that a few years ago too.  I was a techy who thought most business people only had a limited amount to add to any true entrepreneurial endeavor.  I still think that's the case for many business types and surely HBS still pumps out its fair share of consultants and crappy-douchebag I-bankers.  Nevertheless, there are also some world-class entrepreneurs there.  People who will and have changed the world in far more significant ways than most technical folks who think the way I used to will ever really appreciate.<p>Also, just for the record, I know there are a group of HBS'ers who do read HN regularly and have attended Startup School.  I for one have not signed up for hndir.com yet and I'm guessing most of them haven't either.  I have my yahoo mail account that I'll use to sign up for random sites, but I'm a bit more selective about how I use my .edu account and it's not clear from the website that they won't use this for spam.  Overall I like the idea though.  Just my 2 cents.",1234717115

Besides the resource issue, they're only working with a single screen, usually a 15"" one at that! I have a Macbook that I will occasionally use for work (though mostly just for reading HN after I wake up, as I am now), but a mere 17"" of screen real state and 2GB of RAM is just not enough for the long-term.<p>Compare this to the 48"" of screen and 6GB of RAM I get from my Mac Pro and there is no comparison. Still, even on that machine I routinely use 4 Spaces because there's just too much crap to keep on one desktop. Another advantage is never having to think about what to keep open; everything I use on a daily basis is always open and accessible in a Space without any waiting. There's no way I could do this on my laptop.<p>I think mobile working is a possibility, but I simply don't believe that laptops can replace desktops when it comes to software development.",1234716479

That's the implicit agreement that you make when you buy a Mac: you're getting the computer Apple wants you to have. If you don't <i>want</i> that computer, don't buy Apple and stop arguing about whether or not Apple computers are good.<p>I <i>get</i> that you want to tinker. My cofounder uses Linux.

Every last person who feels the drive that I do, the obsessive need to have every little anal detail right, uses a Mac.

482043,comment,481324,481324,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"I'm reading On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins, which is about how the human brain thinks (with the angle of replicating this as artificial intelligence).<p>In brief, the neocortex has layers. Inputs from senses arrive at the lowest layer, and the data is propagated upwards through the layers to the top, where inputs from different senses are combined and - simplifying my already simple understanding massively - decisions are made. At the lowest layer of the hierarchy, if it is a visual input, it could be a fragment of a line. This could be combined with neighboring inputs to be an eye, and with more inputs, even further up the hierarchy, to be the face you're looking at.<p>Importantly, data runs down the hierarchy too. This is your brain making predictions of what to see, hear, feel, etc. Suppose someone says ""my hands are cold so I'll put on my dloves"" (not a typo). Say this to an English speaker and they will hear ""gloves""; their mind has predicted the word ""gloves"" from context and experience (some Eastern European speakers won't be fooled, since their languages do have the ""dl"" sound). Or if you're listening to a song, your mind is primed to hear the next note at the right time. If I understand it correctly, cortical columns in some regions basically transmit the signal ""song going as expected"" - just passing up a summary, not the details. If you hear a wrong note, the prediction fails, and the details get passed up to the next layers instead.<p>It occurs to me that some of the abilities described might be the result of impairing the prediction mechanism. Qualities of autistic people/savants/TMS-enhanced people were mentioned in the article:\n-Being unable to recognize the same area when subtle details like shadows were altered.\n-Being able to draw accurately\n-Being able to count hundreds of matchsticks.<p>As mentioned in other comments, accurate drawing requires us to <i>not</i> use the mental categorization we're so used to. Without the prediction mechanism, maybe the details of the inputs propagate higher in the hierarchy, closer to what we might consider consciousness. Similarly, counting matchsticks might require us not to group a heap of matchsticks into ""a heap of matchsticks"" but instead still see each individual matchstick.<p>But I Am Not A Neurologist.",1234715103

Not even the Federal Reserve.<p>Second, reserve requirements are there to insure the institution can cover defaults at a modeled rate.  The requirement is not to cover the entire amount of the loan in the event of a default, but ONLY the difference between the market value of the collateral against the loan and the principal of the loan.<p>So a bank with a $1000 deposit and a 1:9 capital ratio can, indeed, directly lend $9000 if their risk modeling and lending standards predict a sufficiently low default rate.<p>This is why accurate (and conservative??) modeling and subsequent pricing of risk is so very important to a fractional reserve banking system.  Mis-priced risk => actual losses are greater than projected losses => insufficient capital to cover actual losses => bankruptcy.<p>Sprinkle in some 32:1 hedge fund leverage using crap mortgage paper as collateral and you have yourself a financial weapon with a very short fuse.<p>The most recent incarnation of mis-priced risk has been ""houses ALWAYS go up in value"", leading to AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  Which is bullshit and we all know it.  The institutions that bought this crap only held enough capital to cover their modeled default rate of AAA-rated bonds, rather than the (much larger) capital to cover defaults on the junk bonds this trash is really composed of.<p>The situation is actually worse than the author says.  Those banks turn around and use the mis-priced MBS paper as collateral for even larger loans, and now the problem has REALLY been magnified.  This goes 3 or more levels deep with some of the credit derivatives out there.<p>Edit:  P.S.  I think the pirate author guy is kind of a doomsday nutjob.  I do not think the U.S. will collapse in a poof of logic.",1206341936

It would only work if it was guaranteed to get your response, otherwise it's not worth it.<p>What about a separate email address (or even domain) for premium email? You could set the fee to receive an email (and adjust it to restrict flow to what you can handle), and refund people who don't get a response from you within x period of time. Certain senders could be excluded from paying. The senders could even choose how much to pay (These emails were sent without payment. Those were.)<p>You then publish only that address on your site/blog/whatever, and give your personal address to friends and family.<p>This idea needs a lot of digging into to really see if it's viable but I like the concept. The potential downside is that the government might like the idea of email tax.",1206341785

144382,comment,144321,144321,0,0,jk4930,,,"Short blog entries on complex topics most often won't tell the entire story. There's more on getting out of poverty than not resting or asking the wrong questions. This is not about dumb wealth redistribution but social institutions and technical infrastructure. 
Instead of such intellectual fast food better one reads something useful like the (free) first chapter of ""The Birth of Plenty"": <a href=""http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/404/CH1.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/404/CH1.HTM</a><p>After that one should look for 'new institutional economics' and 'complex adaptive systems' to better understand how social institutions, path dependencies, and (general) environmental conditions drive or constrain a society and how that influences social stratification and mobility (and indirectly poverty).<p>This posting isn't meant to be an arrogant indoctrination. But saying ""there are no causes of poverty"" is simply (and sometimes fatally) wrong. But to understand this one should switch from polemics to empirics.<p>It even has some direct relevance to hackers: Being busy and producing something other people want is not enough to generate wealth. When you think a supporting social and technical environment has no influence on the probability of success, then go and try to run your startup in (obviously restful) North Korea.",1206341232

Competition is healthy for any market, and for the businesses in that market.  Giving consumers the option to choose between services means more flexibility to improve on what you have, and how you plan to introduce it.<p>Yes, Tumblr is a great application backed by some very competent developers out there, but have you given a look at Chyrp (<a href=""http://www.chyrp.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chyrp.net</a>)?  The immediate user may not directly associate it with a tumblelog from the very beginning, but if you look at the way it's created, even look at the code it's obvious that's just what the application is, and it's doing incredibly well on it's own two feet.<p>Market economies are all about competition, supply and demand.

First of all, this article is about San Francisco, and second of all, you complained that the described world can&#x27;t possibly function in real world. The described world <i>does</i> exist, as mentioned by myself and other people in this sub-thread. Whether it exists everywhere or not is inconsequential. A single instance is sufficient to prove that your statement was in false. I gave one example, other people gave their own examples, in reality in Europe you can pretty much chose any German or Austrian city to pick your examples (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good in other western countries too, I just pick on what I <i>know</i>).<p>Second, you are wrong. Medium cities are just like the big cities except without the metro system. Trams and busses are just as good and effective, and the metro is not needed (I hope the reason why not is obvious). Also, here in Austria at least, the trains are really good, really fast, and really, really frequent, and you can just take the metro to the big city center with the same ticket (something you can&#x27;t do with cars, because cars are not allowed in the center).<p>Very small towns and don&#x27;t need public transport because it takes 10 minute to cross them by foot.<p>This notion that you need a car to move around town or buy groceries is an american concept and seems preposterous to us, europeans.

7888287,comment,7887575,7888069,11,0,AlexanderDhoore,,,"Haha, that&#x27;s a lot of questions. Let me try to go over them.<p>I say SolScript is &quot;duck typed&quot; and &quot;scripted&quot;, because that&#x27;s how it feels to program SolScript. However, under the hood, SolScript is a statically typed, compiled language.<p>About the &quot;spreadsheet&quot; idea, that is exactly what the SolScript IDE (Solide) is going to be. There will be a spreadsheet mode, which displays the source code as a spreadsheet. The last chapter talks about Solide, if you want to know more. (The creation of Solide is going to be my job, and I&#x27;ve been watching Bret Victor videos, all day yesterday, for inspiration.)<p>We have no &quot;deep copy&quot; of the data. The data is simply mutated in place, for performance. The compiler knows in what order it has to update the datacells, so SolScript users don&#x27;t notice any of this. If I say `b = a`, then `a` will be calculated before `b` uses it. (If you want the value of `a` before `a` is updated, you say `b = previous a`.)<p>The whole &quot;plain text&quot; argument is about the fact that companies can die. So can (UN)MANNED, of course. The difference is that plain text files will always be readable, in contrast to Word files. You don&#x27;t need our software to read plain text documentation.<p>Releasing the source is not something we plan to do (for now). We are not against the idea, but right now we have other priorities. There will probably be a gratis version, even for commercial use. Only that version won&#x27;t be certified.<p>Yes, SolScript is written in an &quot;unsafe&quot; language: C. This makes it extremely cross-platform. We can run on Linux, OS X, Windows, iOS, VxWorks... The coding standards of our C code are extremely strict. Avionics style.<p>And about Markdown, yes that could be applied to other programming languages. BUT SolScript integrates with Markdown on a whole new level. For example, sections in Markdown are the scopes or namespaces of a SolScript program. Markdown is built into SolScript, not tacked on.<p>Edit: Circular dependencies really make no sense, in a declarative programming language. Defining `a = b` and `b = a` has no clear meaning, so the compiler will throw an error. However, you can define things recursively using `previous`. For example: `a = b + 1 initially 0` and `b = previous a`. In this case, `b` is 0, 1, 2, 3... and `a` is 1, 2, 3, 4...",1402660171

My father didn&#x27;t care for 5 months, continued doing his job, as if he was getting payed twice as much. After 7 months passed he brought the project to an end and the firm maid a substantial amount of money because of his work. He then resigned. My Dad didn&#x27;t care if he wasn&#x27;t getting payed, his work matters most to him and he proved it. It pains me to see him today (3 years later), still searching for jobs and going crazy, because he can&#x27;t do what he loves the most.

Intuition isn&#x27;t the same as data.<p>However I can see where the author is coming from as now I am engaged this is how I use Twitter too. Anecdotally it seems correct that people that get the best out of Twitter are those that interact publicly and productively with non-celebrity strangers.<p>One line seems to hit the nail on the head:<p><pre><code>  > On Twitter, you interact with people you don’t know, \n  > and the friendship doesn’t have to be mutual. This is a \n  > good thing, but can be scary at first.\n</code></pre>\nThis is what makes Twitter great but it depends on growing your confidence and interacting inside communities where this is a norm. It can be quite socially dangerous to mess this up: some communities have high walls and aggressive in-group tendencies, and some people do not yet have the social skill required for global online communities.<p>The other day I read this great quote by Nick Szabo on Usenet and I think it holds true for Twitter, too:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Those who have never tried electronic communication\n   may not be aware of what a &quot;social skill&quot; really is.\n   One social skill that must be learned, is that other\n   people have points of view that are not only different, \n   but *threatening*, to your own. In turn, your opinions\n   may be threatening to others. There is nothing wrong\n   with this. Your beliefs need not be hidden behind a \n   facade, as happens with face-to-face conversation.\n   Not everybody in the world is a bosom buddy, but you\n   can still have a meaningful conversation with them.\n   The person who cannot do this lacks in social skills.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nTwitter needs to connect like people to like people and slowly nurture positive, open conversation. But there are certain things you can&#x27;t expect people to do with just a nice UX.<p>Perhaps they should be influencing with PR and education as well as UX.",1402657246

3389947,comment,3385898,3388502,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"That's the expendable Falcon Heavy. SpaceX is also working on a fully reusable Falcon 9, which would naturally allow for a fully reusable Falcon Heavy. The fuel costs for a Falcon Heavy are around half a million dollars, if we posit that overall operational costs per flight could be kept to around 1.5 million dollars then costs of delivering cargo to Mars would be around $100/kg. That's a pretty straightforward extrapolation of current trends. If we imagine some ways to make the process more efficient we could imagine batching up cargo in LEO and pushing it to Mars via electric propulsion (a proven technology), for example.<p>These are pretty decent conceivable practical minimums for cost of shipping cargo to Mars within the next 20 years, though any estimate (minimum or otherwise) beyond that time frame would be entirely speculative due to the potential for technological advances.<p>You claim that the figures for Falcon Heavy cost of launching to Mars are ""optimistically low"", but that is not the case. Firstly, Mars launch is a well understood problem on the scale of launch to GEO. Second, the figures SpaceX are quoting are launch <i>prices</i> which include a substantial profit margin. The actual costs (especially after development costs have been amortized) are lower. And as I pointed out this doesn't represent a proper reasonable estimate of the floor for launch costs to Mars even over the next 20 years, let alone over the next, say, 50.",1324767517

3389943,comment,3389144,3389667,4,0,Periodic,,,"Having worked in Academia, charts are often used to reveal trends in large data sets.  This is particularly true these days when the data is gigabytes of multi-dimensional measurements that require processing to derive the underlying properties.  The only good way to present data like this is in charts.<p>Graphics are now very important to presenting your science!  The results can't speak for themselves, because no one can understand them in less than a few days of study, so they need a translator.<p>Sometimes people do create the equivalent of link-bait info-graphics that do their best to make a small result look large.  It's usually balanced by the rest of the paper being light on details.<p>These infographics are just the newest version of sound-bytes and headlines.  They don't tell the whole story, but they tell enough that you can tell your friends and pass out the link, and feel like you know the subject without having to spend more than 5 minutes reading.  What we're missing is the balance of listing methodology and explicitly listing sources.  There's little to no onus on the publisher to fact-check their data.<p>As long as we live in a society with 1-minute clips on the evening news, we'll have crappy infographics.",1324767461

It is used in full force for both fixed and mobile networks, and select government agencies can call carriers to get records and do live wire tapping.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_L...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawful_interception"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawful_interception</a><p>Microsoft's premise is that the techniques used for VoIP are different then traditional lawful interception, but I don't think anything described in the patent is non-obvious.
Nonetheless, they will probably get it awarded, as more then 50% of patent applications do (forgot where I got the statistic from), and even more when its from large tech corporations that have dedicated in-house patent lawyers filing the patent applications.<p>When you think about it, the USPTO gets money from awarding patents and collects yearly fees through the 20-year life of a patent, and the army of patent examiners they have on staff do not come cheap (starting salaries range from 52-79k), and for the most part they are self-funded and do not rely on U.S. Congress money - so there is every incentive in the system for them to award every patent applied for.",1324767258
3389933,comment,3388893,3389782,8,0,pavelludiq,,,"<i>Is there a 'lispish' way to write code?</i><p>Yes. If you read enough Clojure, Scheme and Common Lisp code you'll see that they have their own different styles. On a few occasions I read Common Lisp code written by schemers, it was somewhat ugly and inelegant, although the same code would have been elegant if written in scheme. Here's an example from an Erik Naggum article( <a href=""http://www.xach.com/naggum/articles/3195982690560792@naggum.net.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xach.com/naggum/articles/3195982690560792@naggum....</a> ). First the Scheme in common lisp:<p><pre><code>  (defun make-account (balance)
    (labels ((withdraw (amount)
                       (if (>= balance amount)
                           (progn
                             (setf balance (- balance amount))
                             balance)
                         (format t ""Insufficient funds"")))
             (deposit (amount)
                      (setf balance (+ balance amount))
                      balance)
             (dispatch (m)
                       (cond
                        ((equal m 'withdraw) withdraw)
                        ((equal m 'deposit) deposit)
                        (t (format t ""Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT"")))))
      dispatch))
</code></pre>
Perfectly reasonable way to do it in Scheme, not in Common Lisp. Heres how you do it in idiomatic Common Lisp:<p><pre><code>  (defclass account ()
     ((balance :initarg :deposit :initform 0 :accessor balance)))

  (defmethod withdraw ((account account) amount)
     (decf (balance account) amount))

  (defmethod deposit ((account account) amount)
     (incf (balance account) amount))

  (defmethod withdraw :before ((account account) amount)
     (unless (<= amount (balance account))
       (error ""~A has insufficient funds to withdraw ~A."" account amount)))
</code></pre>
I'll let the code speak for itself :)<p>Lisp allows you to turn code like the first example into code like the second.<p>edit: formatting",1324767252

Amazon was all set up before the transfer; it was NetSol's screwup (which is probably some ancient set of CGI scripts) that caused the problem, and there was no way we could have avoided it even if we had known exactly what would occur - NetSol controlled both (a) the registry data telling the root servers where to find our SOA, and (b) the name server that the old SOA pointed to.<p>People using GoDaddy for both registration and DNS could find themselves in exactly the same predicament, so it makes sense that they'd want to do it carefully.",1324767240

However, allegations that there is wrongdoing surrounding organ harvesting is nothing new, yet nothing is being done to investigate it, nor is China being proactive in  inviting people to come investigate and provide over site to prove that everything is internationally acceptable.<p>The fact that China isn't trying to prove the allegations wrong and that there is willful ignorance among other nations is frightening.<p>People often use the argument, ""This can't possibly be true, because it would be very hard to hide such atrocities."", but if anything WWII proved how easy it is to hide such gross atrocities. During World War II, no one really knew what was happening in the concentration camps until the Russians first arrived in the Majdanek camp in July, 1944 for the first time and saw it with their own eyes. Just before they arrived, the Germans spent a lot of effort to try and destroy any evidence of what had been happening. If anything, WWII proves how long people at a distance and with no local knowledge can go without knowing horrible things were occurring. From what I remember what was discovered at the Majdanek camp wasn't even that bad because the Nazis had enough time to partially cover up the gravity of what was being done. AFAIK, it wasn't until  Auschwitz was discovered January, 1945, that people truly discovered the gravity of the situation.<p>Allegations like this should be investigated by non-political independent third parties whose primary mission is preventing human rights atrocities.<p>IMHO both humans and other entities should be innocent until proven guilty, but organizational entities, even entire countries, should be subject to investigations into allegations.<p>Right now we have a situation where China isn't innocent, but no one has investigated to see if it might be guilty either.",1324766578

I can't trust SpaceX to put millions of people on Mars when they can't even be bothered to do a small test on the moon. I understand that the environments are different, so the techniques and technologies used for a moon settlement may not easily transfer to Mars, but there is no real reason not to make an effort, even if it's just a year-long experiment to see if ten people could survive. Even if the moon isn't an important strategic goal, and I'm not sure that it isn't, at least it makes for a good testing ground. Bypassing the moon for Mars smacks more of unbridled grandiosity than it does of responsible reality.",1324764578

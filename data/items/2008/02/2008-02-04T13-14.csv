109095,comment,109073,109073,0,0,chmike,,,"Funny correlation. Would be worth verifying quantitatively.<p>However beware of confusing correlation with cause-effect relation. We don't know which one could be the cause of the other or there could be a hidden common cause. For instance, if weather is good, people go outside and don't do piracy. If weather is bad, people stay at home and look for entertainment. These are just examples.<p>A funny story is the one with the London taxi drivers. A survey has pointed out a positive and significant correlation between the number of accidents and wearing coats. It was assumed that coats could hinder movements of drivers and be the cause of accident. A new law was prepared to prohibit drivers to wear coats when driving.<p>Finally another study pointed out that people wear coats when it rains! Rain was the hidden factor common to wearing coat and accident frequency.",1202132548

109093,comment,108861,108861,0,0,brlewis,,,"You need a different counterexample.  Arc' programs have more nodes than Arc programs.<p>In Arc, parens only define the structure of the parse tree.  They carry no additional information.  In Arc' the compiler's behavior must change based on the type of paren.  You need an additional node of information for each paren pair to know its type.  Thus Arc' programs are substantially longer when measured by nodes.",1202132302

Learn to program, don't learn a language or a technology.<p>You can (and should!) do AJAX+RoR on your own.  Learn how to <i>think</i> about programming.<p>I loved MIT.  But I also went XVI (aero eng) because I've always felt that a direct approach is a mistake.  I got to learn about rockets and aircraft and learn how to apply CS by taking all of those classes too.",1202131095
109090,comment,108861,108861,0,0,mojuba,,,"This is a nice thought experiment. We all know it proves nothing and at the same time, formally, it does prove something.<p>Let's get back to PG's original essay. What he says essentially is, if the goal of high-level languages is to make computer instructions (programs) shorter, then making them even shorter might be the ultimate goal of any high-level language. The shorter the better. Sounds like a very valid point.<p>However, there's something I think PG omits or disregards - the complexity of the language in terms of the total number of abstractions introduced, which intuitively should be low as well. In Lisp, which itself is a succinct language, you may have a framework with some number of functions in one case, and an equivalent framework with fewer functions in another case. Same applies to built-in constructs and notions - you may have fewer notions that cover same scenarios or vice versa, both producing (roughly) the same length in terms of tokens. But clearly, there's a difference and we'd prefer the framework that has fewer functions/abstractions/notions to remember.<p>So if we agree on this, Arc' is bad because it introduces more notions while achieving no or very little effect, if not harm actually.",1202130437

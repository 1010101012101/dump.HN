In fact, that is why I started arguing with the initial post. To summarize:<p>1. Being poor does not make you stupid.<p>2. Giving money to the poor is best handled by an organization that can ensure the money is not being abused. In the U.S., the cost of adequate administration of aid to the poor is not possible, and they do such a poor job at it that welfare is abused to the point that it is hurtful to the poor because it keeps them down and dependent on the government or worse it keeps them using drugs. Charities such as the Catholic church which gives more money and time than any other organization including the Red Cross are better fit to do this, however the growth and acceptance of atheism/child abuse by priests/the economy/several other rights (gay right to marry, pro-choice, wanting openly-gay/female priests) issues continue to lower giving without a similarly efficient organization (nuns who work for room/board without families) getting those funds.<p>3. I understand that not all have the opportunities I&#x27;ve described (libraries, computers), and I think they should. It is more common in the U.S., and one of the main reasons it isn&#x27;t used as much or in the right way is due to parenting and community. I think that we need to spend more time working on all of that, not just using the welfare system (which in the U.S. is a bureaucratic mess that is unable to effectively manage how funding is allocated).",1374665048

Weve broken records, weve attracted the attention of the world, and were marching closer and closer to bringing the Ubuntu Edge to life. $32 million is a huge number, and weve never danced around this fact. To get there, were going to need your help to bring family, friends, fans, and followers to the campaign.<p>This crowdfunding process has already provided us with a lot of great feedback, especially about our perks -- and weve been listening to it all. You told us you want more opportunities to get the Ubuntu Edge at a lower contribution level, so we went back to our spreadsheets and came up with a solution. Today were changing our perk levels. Well offer a limited number of phones at each level, and as each tier runs out the next ones will be made available, so act quickly to get the best deal!<p>Youll only see the first few levels on the campaign page today, but continuing our habit of openness and transparency we want to share the whole plan with you.<p>Hundreds of you have already contributed $830 for an Ubuntu Edge, but dont worry. Well refund the difference at the end of the campaign so you wont lose out. Well contact you all directly with more information.<p>We need to keep the campaign momentum going. Please help by sharing the news and, of course, keep pledging!<p>The Ubuntu Edge team<p>edit:\nLink to project: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubuntu-edge",1374663813

They basically legislated a nag screen that you need to &#x27;X&#x27; on every site you visit.<p>It gives shoddy &quot;web consultants&quot; a hook to bait clients with (you are required by law to have a cookie compliant website.). It creates extra nonsense work for developers. Stupid bikeshed meeting all around the country. And a very tiny annoyance occurring 10000 time per second to someone user somewhere. Lots of website owners that know they are breaking some law someplace and decide not to bother about it which is corrosive to rule of law.<p>Naturally, it does absolutely nothing to achieve the goals it set out to achieve (tracking?). Nothing. It&#x27;s pure incompetence.",1374663803

The little bits of truth he speaks are not worth wading through the coin tosses, just stay away.<p>Next, when you're trying to figure out which stocks to buy, forget about the stocks. Don't look to PE's, and all the other ratios to figure out where the market is going.<p>Look at the world around you.  Look at where the /world/ is going. Which things are going to be hot 20 years from now?  Those are the things that are going to be your biggest wins.  You only need one or two or three really big winners to set you for life and you have many years to find them.<p>Don't look at the latest headlines to decide where to put your money.  You may make money trading stocks, buying at $22 and selling at $26, it is possible and that is very likely to happen.<p>But that is not the goal.  Four dollars is not the goal.  Four million dollars is the goal and that takes years and years.<p>So, take your time.  Don't invest any real dollars for a year.  Take the dollars you would invest and put them into books and education and paper trading.  I know it sounds lame and where's the fun in that, but if fun is what you are looking for, go to vegas.  Poker is more exciting and easier to figure out how to win and you can make a lot of money with a $2,000 bank roll if you play your cards right.<p>If you are just absolutely itching to put that money into the market, look in to index funds.  Index funds are easily managed funds that don't cost a lot of money to keep running but are still diversified.<p>Put your money into one of those, like buy the QQQQ or something -- IT MAY CRASH right after you buy it, the point isn't to make money, the point is to pay attention.  Pay attention to the short term swings in the market, but don't buy or sell based on them.<p>Look at the fundamentals of the entire market to decide when to make big moves. Make little moves on little time frames, big moves on big time frames.<p>For example, you could have looked at the markets a couple years back and known that the future didn't look so hot.  You probably didn't know when everything was going to collapse, but you knew the fundamentals weren't looking very good.  Okay, so then you might want to tend toward market underweight.<p>Anyway, lots of useless advice summed up in a couple words: Don't get trigger happy.  Use your head. Practice makes perfect. Stocks are not a get rich quick scheme.",1232416769

441210,comment,440793,440793,0,0,bwh2,,,"I suggest using the Department of Education college data. Most of the ~7,000 US schools listed have homepage URL listed, which you could grab the domain from with relative ease. Aside from that, you're probably looking at parsing Wikipedia pages or grabbing data from Petersons, which is not free. The DOE dataset is a good starting point, but you'll run into a fair (~300? I don't remember exactly) schools without domains listed, but they're schools like Joe's Barber School, not major universities. Any reasonably sized school has a domain in the DOE dataset. Peterson's is good, but they have restrictions on use which can be annoying to deal with if you care about legality.<p>Also, on the note of .edu domains being restricted to post -secondary institutions; that's not entirely true. That wasn't the original rule, so some non-university level schools are grandfathered in and own .edu domains. For instance, my high school has a .edu domain.",1232416090

441206,comment,441156,441156,0,0,vlad,,,"Do not ""play the stocks game"" if you think it's a game.  The point of investing is to make money.  Don't invest in any company unless you have valid reasons to believe the company will go up in value in whatever time frame you're looking for results.  And this should be true every week, or you should sell when you don't feel comfortable with the stock any longer.  Because the way you feel, so will other investors, and if for whatever reason they don't feel comfortable, they will pull their money, so you might as well react on that feeling first.  If the stock continues its devaluation, then it was a good call by you, if the stock actually gets more valuable, then you still might feel good about leaving it since it might now be even more likely to drop now at its higher price.  Don't invest in stock simply because you don't know what else to do with the money.  And don't invest money you might need in the next six months; the point is to  keep money but make logical bets from time to time on companies when you feel you have a much larger informational advantage than most everybody else, using money you won't need in the near future.  The point is not to lose money, though if you do lose a bit, it won't be tomorrow's mortgage payment.<p>The most important thing to realize is that the best thing you could with the money is to put it in a savings account and try to release lots of software or web apps for feedback and practice in running a business.  Your salary and job opportunities will increase, as well as give you a chance to make money on the side, as well, pay for retirement, and a small runway for you to go full time if you want to take your ideas further.  Because with stocks, you're buying companies, not pieces of paper, and finding a company that returns 2x or 3x the investment will be hard to do at the scale of companies listed on NASDAQ, and a micro-cap company where you have enough knowledge or control would be hard to find either.  But if you invest your time towards creating things, you'll raise the worth of your skills (or at least, remain competitive and diversified), get ""free"" business lessons from your experience, and may be able to make thousands of dollars on the side per year or month, on top of that, as a bonus.  This is almost a guaranteed investment.  And if you could use some of the money you saved up to start a company and figure out the accounting behind it, so the only thing you have to worry about is creating stuff,  then you'll be basically set for life.  Why?<p>Because as someone trying to run a business, as well as someone who follows the latest in technology, you'll be in a better position than almost any other investor regarding knowing when to invest in tech companies.  On top of that, I can imagine that at some point you could even be a seed investor in companies that are not even on the stock exchange.  You will also be the go-to guy at your company.  Finally, your company might even become profitable enough for you to go full-time or worth enough to somebody that they'll pay you five, six, or maybe even seven figures for it.<p>Investing is not gambling.  And you're paying $7-14 a trade, so it's probably better to stick with 5 companies or so, which helps to diversify, and if you have to sell your whole position to buy a better one, you can sell all of it for just that fee, instead of trying to sell a bunch of different ones for $7-14 each.<p>Don't invest in companies you wouldn't buy from.  Invest in companies that seem well run and on the upward trend, that at the same time, you feel that other people, once they find out how good it is in the next few months, will invest in as well, and therefore you would make your money back and then some, based on lots of new people learning about the company and buying their product and increasing their earnings, as well as the influx of buyers of their stock, sending the price of it up by way of more means than one.<p>Finally, the trends of the last 40 years are irrelevant to what will happen in the next 40.  This is 100% true.  Investing is not a tax, and you should not treat it as such (i.e. it leaves your bank account, and if it comes back to help you in any way, then that's great!  No, it's not how this works.)",1232415954

Unless you have friends in high places and plan to do insider trading (which is very illegal), you will be one more amateur playing against the professionals in the banks and hedge funds. The pros work at least 12 hours a day and have years of experience. They are also better connected than you. So... what advantage do you think you have? If you can't answer this simple question, I advise you to choose a game where you have an advantage.<p>- if you think I am being too pessimistic and defeatist, do read Prof. Larry Harris' paper <i>The Winners and Losers of the Zero-Sum Game: The Origins of Trading Profits, Price Efficiency and Market Liquidity</i> at <a href=""http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~lharris/ABSTRACT/Zerosum.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~lharris/ABSTRACT/Zerosum.htm</a><p>- be ready to lose your $2000 (like someone else mentioned before) and accept it as a ""price"" to pay to learn something about investing.<p>- brokers are crooks. All of them. They will ""rape"" you whenever they have a chance.<p>- don't invest in stocks, invest in yourself. If you are on HN, I assume you like to write code. Investing $2000 in an idea you might have will likely yield better dividends in the long term.<p>I am not trying to be pedantic or anything. I am only trying to put things in perspective. Everybody would like to make money in the stock market, but few manage to do it... and the ones who do manage to make money consistently over the years (and within the law) most likely have years and years of experience and hard work under their belts.",1232415554

It would be very easy to be caught in an upswing in some market you're investing in--be it US technology in 2000 / 2006, or Czech railroads in 2009, or whatever--and be stunned when they dive when you start playing for real money.  Investing in things one believes in is dangerous advice.  Believing is important in many things in hacker culture; investing in public companies can't be one of them.  You need more solid evidence, not just faith.",1232413798

Does anyone know if AT&T or any other wireless providers have any plans to go into this market? Obviously, tying a device to a particular network sucks because it locks you into that network, but I would be much more likely to pay for a monthly data plan if I could get a car radio that used the same connection to stream music!<p>I imagine the problem here might be licensing, but I'm not really knowledgeable enough to know.",1232413760

When constructing a plant, they put 150 spaces in the parking lot, and when people start parking on the grass, they know it's time for another plant. Each plant works as a group. There are no bosses. No titles. Salaries are determined collectively. No organization charts, no budgets, no elaborate strategic plans. Wilbert Gore - the late founder of the company, found through trial and error that 150 employees per plant was most ideal.

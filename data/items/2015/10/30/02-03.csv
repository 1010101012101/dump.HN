That is just hilarious.<p>He is claiming a lot of things honestly and it is just plain lie.

I wouldn&#x27;t read too much into a leak filtered through journalists, and instead look at what Google&#x27;s actually working on:<p>- Google has Chromium developers working on a DART-based Mobile UI framework and execution engine, Flutter (<a href=""http://flutter.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flutter.io/</a>). It&#x27;s looking to be far better than the existing Android UI system - built for touch and 120fps from the start. This uses the Dartium VM and a bridge to allow the DART apps to use all the native features of the platform, it&#x27;s much more than just another web framework. Development on this is very active right now, clearly a sizable team working fulltime - and they&#x27;re building new developer tools also. There was a talk on this a while ago: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnIWl33YMwA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnIWl33YMwA</a> .<p>- Google has built a Runtime to allow existing Android Java-based apps to run on Chrome OS, and is currently testing this and working with developers to get their apps to run on it. It doesn&#x27;t make much sense to invest in building that out just for chromebooks, since the experience on a Chromebook with Android apps is pretty awful (can&#x27;t resize etc), but it makes total sense if it&#x27;s going to be how legacy Java/Android apps run on the new Chrome based phone OS.<p>The sad truth is that Android simply isn&#x27;t a very well engineered system - it&#x27;s been improved over time, but problems persist -  like the complex update process leading to unsatisfied users and security problems, poor UI performance (even now, Android can barely do simple animations at a steady 60fps on the latest Nexus devices, and has little hope of allowing for the beautiful animations the Material Design team has come up with), and poor battery life. Google&#x27;s also at a dead-end with Java given the ongoing legal battles, and with Apache Harmony dead they have to maintain the standard library implementation themselves.<p>On the other hand, Chrome OS performs great, has awesome battery life on Chromebooks, is quite possibly the most secure end-user OS ever, and Chromebooks get speedy updates for at least 5 years. I know which one I&#x27;d choose as the basis for a merged OS.",1446173196

While individual job openings exist and drive the number of people that we&#x27;re looking to hire at a site, during the recruiting process you aren&#x27;t really being matched to those. If the job opening is for a SWE, then you get a generic SWE recruiting process and interview panel. If you pass that, then the site managers will figure out which SWE roles at that site you would best fit into - but because everything we do is secret, as an outsider you are basically unable to have any useful input into that process, you just cannot know enough about it before you&#x27;re hired. The public versions of job postings are missing most of the important details, and the way we do things is too different. We&#x27;re also far more interested in skills than experience.<p>Moving between teams is easy once you&#x27;ve been hired (because you&#x27;ve already passed the generic interview for your ladder), and at that point you&#x27;ll have enough information to make an informed choice. People are expected to move around, and do. This has got a lot to do with why the hiring process works the way it does: you&#x27;re being hired for all the future jobs you&#x27;ll do, not the one you get assigned to on day one.<p>(If this was about roles outside the engineering org, I have no knowledge of how hiring works for those)<p>> On the positive side, all the Googlers who I&#x27;ve spoken with through the various interviews have been smart and pleasant.<p>This is in some sense both the goal of our hiring process and the evidence that it&#x27;s working well.",1446172930

In essence, her family only found out in march 2013 that their ancestor&#x27;s cells (which had been taken without consent) were widely used for research. The family complained, and a settlement was reached with the NIH, allowing the family some measure of control over where the cells are used, crediting the origins of the cells in publications, and removing the genome from public-access databases. Some hail this as a victory for research ethics, while some feel that it confuses the issue of who has control over donor tissue and genetic data.<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/07/henrietta-lacks-family-settlement-on-dna-info_n_3720936.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/07/henrietta-lacks-fam...</a>",1446172898

It&#x27;s nigh impossible, even with a keyboard because it doesn&#x27;t support multi-tasking well.  Sure, it supports OS multi-tasking, but it doesn&#x27;t support user multi-tasking.<p>Android is based around the single-task model.  You have a foreground app that takes up the entire screen and other apps are backgrounded.  You can switch between apps fairly quickly, but you can only have one open at a time.  There are some attempts to fix this, such as Samsung&#x27;s split-screen, but none are officially supported.  We&#x27;ve even moved to having Chrome tabs use this model.<p>I love my Chromebook for work though.

You can have many windows open at once and quickly switch between them without losing state or visibility.<p>Windows tried to merge the two with Windows 8 and it was a terrible user experience.

It&#x27;s currently in its beginning stages and its goals are to provide both a significant amount of compatibility with existing extensions and a significant reduction in the overhead to call out to C extensions over what is currently implemented in PyPy.  On the performance side the new approach was said to remove about 40% of the existing overhead.  There are tons of corner cases that still need to be worked on for the new approach to become production worthy and there is no guarantee that there will be no show stoppers that come up or that the tail of corner cases that need to be dealt with becomes a nightmare and the approach is abandoned.

5518981,comment,5517683,5518774,3,0,kingmanaz,,,"There is a case for Ada being a fun language to program in.  Ada will likely appeal to those who enjoy organization.  A fan of Ada will likely have a neatly-ordered garage, or if they do DBA work, they will be drawn to the elaborate and tidy typing which C.J. Date demonstrated in his Tutorial-D language.  To reuse the garage analogy, simple types will likely appear to those naturally drawn to Ada as unboxed tools or unshelved parts.<p>Personally I prefer C or Go's approach to typing, eg., use base types (int32, int64, string, etc.) as often as possible or practicable and keep the type hierarchy flat by avoiding multiple-inheritance.  Using base types keeps things simple as is reflected in Go's documentation; when descending through documentation for types one can be confident that there is not far to go before hitting a base type.  The object is understood.<p>I do love Ada's use of the range operator (""..""), as with it one can simply create 1-based domains and thereby avoid C's omnipresent 0-based domains.",1365523115

(You might say that it follows as a lemma from the observation that Volvo drivers have more accidents.)<p>E.g. if you make the boundary between ""road"" and ""not road"" less clear and remove lane markings, drivers will drive more carefully. (Amazing!) I visited some towns in Switzerland a few years ago that have taken this approach to extremes -- there are no hard boundaries between road and sidewalk, seven-way intersections (with trams) and no traffic lights -- and it works well (especially for pedestrians).",1365523106

If it does become our nouveau de facto global currency, it will first become an intermediary for traditional currencies to facilitate transactions. Buyers will exchange their dollars and euros for Bitcoins, and sellers will largely exchange their Bitcoins back pounds and krona (or whatever).<p>However, the more people accept Bitcoin, the more people can spend it. There will be a network effect. Eventually, if this pattern holds, the food producers will start to accept it and that's where the ""trouble"" occurs.<p>In theory, if people perceive the stability, utility, and value of Bitcoin to be greater than a traditional currency, <i>and</i> it starts to replace that traditional currency, the traditional currency will collapse, hyperinflation will occur, and there will be a period of pain. The late majority and laggards will lose a lot of money, and the early adopters and early majority will gain. There will simply be a redistribution based on tolerance for risk and foresight. At this stage the value of Bitcoin will soar.<p>Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if governments did their best to make it illegal. Governments don't entertain competition because their role is to maintain the stability of the status quo, which is fair.

Or else how could you characterize Bill Gates' work as being somehow less creative or less wondrous. Bill Gates is trying to foster a world free of disease and poverty, which requires no less of a cool, sci-fi-brainstorm to accomplish...how is that less of a crazy childlike ambition than building an electric car?<p>In fact, I would argue even that Gates' path is even far more crazy and childlike. In order to do what he has done, he's had to get out of the relatively clean, logical bubble of technology and deal with messy, real world politics to accomplish his goals...and yet he still pushes forth in idealism. Contrast this with Musk, who after a less-than-favorable review in the New York Times, threw a fit. I'm not saying Musk was or wasn't justified, I'm pointing out that real world revolution takes both child-like wonder and an ability to handle out-of-your-realm realities...Gates is farther along in this difficult path than Musk, though I agree, Musk is more likely to have an Iron Man-like movie made about him.",1365522944

You can have a web-based service that's hosted on your servers and only services your intranet. This way you get most of the advantages of the web (no software to install and maintain, and easy access to the resources by your users), and still maintain control over your stack. There is very little reason to build desktop software anymore.<p>>For a document that the visitor cannot afford to lose, or for anything in which privacy, security or personal control are issues, a Web-based document is obviously a mistake<p>I don't see the obviousness of this. In fact, if it's a document that you cannot afford to lose, a cloud service makes much more sense than something stored locally (even with backup procedures). There are cloud services that handle sensitive data (such as patient records and images) today, successfully. Yes, there may be cases in which it makes sense to have data reside on your servers, as opposed to on some cloud-provider's, but those are edge cases now. We recently went through something like this at work, instead of hosting and maintaining our own Sharepoint servers, we went with a cloud-based CRM. It makes too much sense. Our source code, which is by far the most valuable piece of our business, is hosted on kiln. We do have backup strategies in cases kiln servers get hit by an asteroid, but we have no qualms about fogcreek maintaining our codebase.<p>>Why do you think the big players in cloud-based and Web-based storage and applications are having such a hard time getting people to adopt them?<p>That is absolutely false. In fact, the opposite is true. The trend has been to offload almost everything to the cloud. The big cloud-storage guys all had phenomenal growth.<p>>The data loss was apparently small relative to the total data stored, but anyone who runs a web site can immediately understand how terrifying a prospect any data loss is.""<p>And how are you immune to this when YOU are responsible for managing your backup strategy and maintain your servers. Do you know how many horror stories there are of data loss that occurred because of things like bad RAID setup. Backup, replication, server maintenance is hard, expensive and time consuming, and most of the time it has no relevance to the underlying business.

So perhaps instead of asking ""How many gas stations do you think are in this town?"" try asking ""Could you give me a reasonable estimate of the amount of gas stations in this town?"".<p>I think a lot of people just lock up when they're asked something they don't know in a synthetic situation even when in a real situation they would actually make very good judgements since in any real situation the context is often so much more clear, unless you like to keep your employees in the dark..",1365522417

I can -- they're Special Relativity, General Relativity, and the photoelectric effect. They look great together in family photographs. Einstein actually had biological children, but they just weren't very important to his life or his work.<p>How about the children of two-time (1903 and 1911) Nobel Prizewinner Marie Curie? She had children, but they just weren't very important, either to her personally or to her place in history -- consider that, in her lengthy Wikipedia article, her children are only mentioned in passing (she had two):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie</a><p>> Maybe the answer to OP's question is, ""Because many who could dream and do like Elon Musk would rather focus on the ""little things"" like life, love, and family.<p>Yes, and, given what extraordinary people can accomplish when they are more focused, that's often a tragedy. Consider how often one hears stories of people who inadvertently get involved in child-raising who have no aptitude for it, and who do a terrible job.<p>My point? Relationships and family are a choice in life, not a requirement. People -- men and women -- should feel free to focus on career instead if they wish. The idea that relationships and family are primary requirements is a persistent myth that disproportionately hurts women in their careers, but men as well.<p>Giving birth to a child is nice, but there's no shortage of people doing that.

One of the huge handicaps I had for being parachuted into a very large company at a relatively high level was that I had to work extra hard to establish my ""network"" with other STSM's and DE's.  There was a certain amount of automatic ""if you are a STSM, then automatically your BozoBit is false""), but since there were stories of STSM's who had retired in place, it certainly wasn't an automatic grant of credibility.<p>So your concept of ""Real Googler"" is (a) not as binary as you make it out to be, and (b) it is a reality in any large company, and indeed, in our entire industry.   (You think someone like Guido van Rossum worries about promotions, or doesn't get the pick of which jobs he wants?  :-)<p>If you don't have a good network, where your competence and your work is known outside of your local team, then yes, you are largely dependent on your manager in terms advocating for you for your promotions, and it will be harder to convince another manager in another team to advocate for an exception to the general rules of thumb of transferring early after being hired (yes, it does happen, and yes, it is an exception, and yes there are some really good reasons for that guideline to be in place).   I can't speak to whether or not you had a good manager or not[1], but for someone who is more junior, of course your experience at a company is going to be more dependent on whether you had a good manager or not --- that's true everywhere!   I can say that all of the managers I've had at Google have been excellent, and they all have had a very similar attitude that which was expressed by Matt Welsh --- the attitude of ""servant leadership"", where your goal is to remove obstacles that are getting in the way of those who work for you, and for whom you are very glad to shower credit upon them, because a high functioning team reflects well on the manager and on the tech lead.<p>[1]  I can't speak to this because I'm not familiar with your local team or who your manager was; I only saw your behavior on a company-wide engineering mailing list.<p>Bottom line?  If you want to get ahead, you need to establish your competence and your value to other technical people in your company, and in your industry.  You don't do this by putting down people who are well known in the company and in the industry, and you don't do this by asserting that you have executive level vision and bemoaning the fact that no one is willing to listen to you and willing to grasp how brilliant you are.  No, you put your head down, and you do good work, and you help other people.<p>I may be the ext4 maintainer, and I may be well known, but far more often than not I'm reviewing other people's code, fixing up other people's code, fixing bugs, and helping users.  There's a huge amount of grunt work involved, and I'm happy to do it and I'm happy to shower credit on people at other companies who have invested time and energy making ext4 better.  That's how you get ahead in the world, not by asserting how great you are and by putting down other engineers and/or other companies.

What we want out of a currency is not price appreciation but stability. Monetary economists differ on whether the optimal stability is inflation of 0% or in the low single digits.

The acquirer, which has shareholders, competitors, and lots of money, has no incentive to leak the price on the table, or even the fact that there is a table. It gives away too much information to competitors and creates an unwanted news cycle. So in fact they'll be pissed if information about the negotiation is leaked.<p>If the acquiree actually wants to do a deal, they don't want to piss off the potential acquirer, so they'll keep their mouths shut. But they might have plenty of reasons to leak the negotation price, particularly if they're a company that is losing money and wants to inflate the company's valuation before another round of private financing. Going before investors saying ""We turned down a billion dollars from Google, maybe you heard about it"" creates a nice focal point for the ensuing discussion about the company's valuation.<p>Negotiating in bad faith like this happens all the time, most famously with Facebook/Yahoo! (2006) and Groupon/Google (2010). So the next time you read another news story about an acquisition rumor that includes a price tag, ignore it, because the story's not for you; it's for a future investor.<p>(Note that the foregoing logic does not apply if the acquiree is publicly traded, because the deal must be approved by shareholders, so the acquisition price is always ""leaked"" before the papers are signed.)",1365521354

It's very similar to git, actually: everyone is on a particular commit[1], where each commit has another commit as its parent; clients can create regular commits, and thus move apart in state-space; and then they can accept others' commits to move back together (creating a merge commit in the process.) Very decentralized.<p>Ever since Etherpad/Google Wave/Google Docs, though, OT has been consistently mangled into a hub-and-spoke design, where there's a server who keeps a canonical state, and the OT tie-breaking algorithm is always decided in the server's favor.<p>Used in this fashion, it's not much different (actually a bit higher-overhead than) just having the server arbitrarily accept and temporally-order input operations in a way it likes, and then send back a single overwriting transformation to all clients to move them from their last <i>server-known</i> commits to the new server-canonical commit. (In other words, what any multiplayer game's logic server does.)<p>[1] One major difference is that OT ""commits"" are referred to by their vector-clock, instead of by their SHA. Cryptographic hashes are nice, and would give OT even cooler properties if it could use them, but they're a bit too slow for something that gets regenerated with every character typed.

Kind of makes your head hurt, doesn't it? But it also sounds a bit like a familiar commodity, gold, that's also been on a roll, with its dollar price quintupling over the past decade. Gold has, over time, not been the greatest of assets to invest in. It's not the greatest of currencies, either: Back when the gold standard was widely adhered to, nations struggled regularly with deflation. There's persuasive evidence that the primary cause of the Great Depression was a refusal to unlink currencies from gold until too late. Still, gold has held onto its purchasing power over time.""</i><p>I agree with the author: bitcoins are very similar to gold (""the people's currency""), except they're digital and their supply is mathematically fixed.  So ... how much would a Bitcoin sell for if the world ever comes to value it like gold?<p>Granted, that's a big <i>if</i>, but let's entertain the thought for speculative fun.  All gold mined since the start of civilization is currently valued at around $8.8 trillion.[1]  Divide this figure by the maximum of 21 million bitcoins that can ever be created, and the figure is over $400,000 per Bitcoin.

5518727,comment,5517910,5517910,16,0,TheSwordsman,,,"Full text:<p>Posted on behalf of Silence, EFnet admin:<p>Dear users,<p>EFnet has always been a network that promotes freedom of speech. One of the core pillars of a free virtual society is trust. Trust not only amongst ourselves internally, but an undying trust in the companies that allow their users to connect to our wonderful network. We have survived over two decades, in a world that is increasingly image- and video-based. IRC can offer neither of those. IRC is based on ideas. Ideas that are exchanged in text. With text, as opposed to images and videos, one has to be put extra effort into the subliminal, the meaning, the message. This has been our catcher in the rye, and we intend to protect this content-based communication form, for as long as it is appreciated by the hundreds of thousands who every day turn to IRC for philosophical debates, dating and just about anything you can think of (I’m sure a lot of the things in that last category does not belong here in this text, but you get the picture!).<p>We rely solely at the goodwill of others, as is the case with most things worth saving. There is no money to be made. We all do this for free. Sure, some companies might have benefited from a small level of advertisement, attracting customers to their products. But all in all, it has mostly been an uphill battle against enormous attacks, sometimes exceeding 75Gbps of DDoS. This has made it impossible for all but the largest organizations to host a server on our network, or any other large virtual society. We are Don Quijote and the weather mills are often winning.<p>One of our key strategies is to preserve a close relationship with the major Internet- and Hosting Service Providers, as those are the networks that our users connect through. This has worked very well due to our personal involvement with a lot of said organizations. If we find an abuser on IRC, we try to not only ban him or her, but also to contact the provider so that the problem is handled at the right end, often with the involvement of law enforcement, as was the case with Kevin Mitnick, t0rn and a lot of other well publicized hackers/crackers.<p>Unfortunately, the past few days many EFnet servers (and more are following) have had to ban an entire ISP, which has not happened in over a decade, if not longer. Naturally, something extreme must happen for this to be even considered. Almost always can we find a solution through the use of good old fashioned communication. Alas, not in this case. Well, here is the story (to the best of my knowledge):<p>One of our EFnet operators located a server that a client was using, the server was most likely hacked and/or used for illegal activities. As IRC is often a playground for these people to use, before moving on to more serious targets (where they can make money through extortion), we take this extremely seriously. Because of the serious nature of this, our operator sent an email to Hetzner.de, a German hosting provider, to help them lower the abuse of their servers, as well as ours. This is usually a fruitful symbiotic relationships, where both parties stand to gain.<p>However, the big difference between this case and all the other thousands of cases we have handled in the past, is that someone at Hetzner chose to forward this complaint to the actual abuser him/herself. This might seem fair enough, as anyone accused should be granted the right to defend him- or herself. However, the email also contained sensitive information about who this operator was, including nicknames (from which names can be derived, and thus, also, home addresses). We know what an impact this can have on your social, not to mention your professional life. We have seen people lose their jobs, after constant attacks and we have also seen companies lose money that is hard to fathom, considering this is still just a simple chat for friends. This is a fundamental breach of that mutual trust that has allowed us to accept clients from Hetzner to use our network - free of charge, just like we do with anyone else wanting to connect.<p>This a give and take network, where mutual trust is vital for our survival. We are maintained by the community, and we exist solely for the community. Hetzner.de has broken one of the most fundamental aspects of any report of criminal activity or suspicion thereof; source protection.<p>I expect us to get attacked now, which will result in a lot of work for the company kind enough to donate money and time to continue to provide us with servers, in an era where almost everything else would be more profitable. But this is an ideological problem, more than a financial one. We have been attacked before, and we will again. We are prepared. But these preparations rely on the fact that we know who the enemy is. Hetzner.de has made that impossible.<p>As a result of this, we have decided to ban all Hetzner IP ranges (both IPv4 and IPv6) from our servers. It seems other networks are following, and I know QuakeNet has published a similar statement. We simply do not want anything to do with a company that values money over source protection and integrity. Some may argue that this was a one time mistake, and that we should not jump to conclusions so fast. Could this have been a mistake? Sure. Does it matter, given the consequences this could have had for this operator’s personal life and health? No. We do not appreciate cowards that would rather see someone else hurt, than take their responsibility.<p>Unfortunately, according to trusted sources (ex-employees) of Hetzner.de, this is policy and not an exception. They have realized they can save money (by limiting attacks) by redirecting the attacks back at the person reporting them. That way, the hacker/cracker/kiddie using their services will not cancel their contract with Hetzner, and in return Hetzner will remain protected. Left are those of us that work for free, and who will continue to do so, for as long as there are honest, reliable companies out there, willing to go the extra mile to protect the freedom of the Internet, and, above all, freedom of press and source protection.<p>Questions on this matter must be directed to Hetzner.de, as our involvement in this situation is over. This has been their decision based on questionable methods. It is unfortunate for them that they got caught, but it is good for the sake of the free Internet.<p>Sincerely yours,<p>Johan Boger, on behalf of EFnet and anyone else believing in integrity, source protection and a free Internet.",1365521110

But immediately the assumption is being made that such a record is bad, if you're trying to hide your financial activities. In reality, all you see is ""Wallet A"" sending bitcoins to ""Wallet B"". While you still need to pay real and traceable money for bitcoins, which can then be tied to your ""Wallet A"", all one needs to do, for example, is generate a couple of throw-away wallets, split the amount of bitcoins up, send them to each wallet, then use those wallets for the final transfer to ""Wallet B"". What happens then is that the pot dealer receives, let's say, 10BC, but such an amount has never directly left your wallet in a single transaction and you have no connection whatsoever to the pot dealer. Again, you might be presented with a chain of transfers and you might be asked why you sent 5BC to a random wallet that has only ever been used to forward that money to the pot dealer. But that, by itself, is not illegal. I can send money to whoever I wish right now and, unless I have specific knowledge of their future actions, what they do with the money has nothing to do with me.<p>-------<p>"" That liability never goes away as it was wilfully evaded and yet the ability to track the transaction never goes away either!""\nPersonally, I think this is more about the ethics of tax evasion, rather than a problem with the currency itself. I do not like to blame objects for the actions of people, but the author clearly has a different point of view.<p>-------<p>""If you wish to fill up your tank with gasoline, for example, few people are going to be willing to wait for 10 minutes, say much less an hour, before being permitted to pump the gas -- or drive off with it.""\nAgain, this is a completely valid statement, but the author immediately assumes that BC is the end-all global currency, thus tries to validate his disapproval of bitcoins based on an imaginary problem, that isn't even an actual problem with bitcoins. If bitcoins solve one or two problems, but don't solve a third, is that a valid dismissal of the currency as a whole? Can we not imagine a world where bitcoins are complementary to government-backed currencies?<p>-------<p>""your value increases because the later person's expenditure of energy increases rather than through your own expenditure of energy.""\nI admit I do not get this one. If I mined 50BC from the start, how do I profit if someone else now mines 25BC? Of course, if the value of BC goes up, as it is doing right now, we both profit, but that has nothing to do with the later person mining bitcoins. Rather it is a normal process where a lot more people are interested in buying bitcoins, so demand goes up along with the price. If no one wanted to use bitcoins, then both people would now be stuck with worthless bits. Also, I disagree with the premise that early adopters shouldn't be rewarded. If I start mining bitcoins right from the start, I carry a much bigger risk of wasting my investment (electricity usage, etc.) than the person that joins later on, once the currency has been established and it seems reasonable that it might be used by millions of people.",1365520694

In more general terms: How well does each application ""scale up/out, horizontally""?<p>The answer depends on the application type and software architecture. For example, most modern web servers are multi-thread/process apps, with minimal shared state in between. Also, modern web stacks generally push cross-request state into a separate datastore layer (if any). As a result, modern web apps tend to scale up linearly, to the performance limits of the datastore layer.

I'm used to having them both before and after the intersection, so then you can clearly see which part it is for, and you can see it wherever you are, and you can see it well from a long distance.  Some countries in Europe have some additional lights at car window level close to the intersection, this helps a lot, but still not ideal.",1365519733

5518504,comment,5517477,5517477,2,0,peterwwillis,,,"This may have much more to do with the install <i>process</i> than how much memory an <i>installed</i> system needs. For example, old RHEL install images required at least 512MB or more to install, because it would uncompress a gigantic bootstrap/initrd into memory instead of running cloop'd or off the disk.<p>An installed system only needs enough memory for the kernel and whatever apps you need to run. Install it with a lot of memory, then reduce the memory footprint to fit your application.",1365519659

If someone cost you time and money and severely harassed users of a service you're offering by illegally attacking your servers, then I bet you'd be all for reporting them as well.<p>The problem with script kiddies is that they're too lazy to create anything of their own and thus cannot emphasis with how hard it is to set up and maintain a free public service. So they don't have any second thought about destroying other peoples hard work. Plus the pseudo-anonymity of being online and the ability to not look your victims in the eye make such crimes easy for even some of the more ethical kids to shrug off.<p>The only way to have an open internet where everyone is free to create and contribute is to rat out those who seek to destroy it. People like the aforementioned might enjoy all the perks of an open internet, but their actions have the opposite effect.<p>So I'm not only in favour of reporting abusers, but have actually reported attacks on my own servers to their respective ISPs.",1365519623

Worse still, sometimes I can't touch my machine whilst they're running.<p>For a long time, I tried the ""don't switch"" mentality. But you just waste a lot of time.<p>Solutions are:<p>1. Avoid it by running shorter experiments - requires intellectual effort and is much like the advice in the article.<p>2. Do something else, but something <i>related to what you're doing</i>. That way, it's not a total cognitive switch. Classic example is working out ideas for how you might best present data whilst an experiment is running, or how you might further automate the process etc.<p>3. If you have to switch, then do something that can easily be dropped. Usually I read a (scientific) paper whilst I wait - this could be vaguely related to the experiments I'm waiting on.",1365519622

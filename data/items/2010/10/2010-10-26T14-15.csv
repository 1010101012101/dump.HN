1834436,comment,1833767,1833767,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>But unless you're willing to believe that the people in charge are always right and that their lies are therefore justified (and if you think that, you haven't been paying attention), you ought to be in favor of any mechanism that brought more facts to light.</i><p>First, I'm a huge fan of leaking information. We have a thousand times too much secrecy as we can stand already. People who leak things -- especially things that the government finds inconvenient for political reasons -- should be praised.<p>Having said that, this author is arguing at the extremes. I am not in favor of using any mechanism to bring facts to light. Murder? Bribery? Torture? Nope, I expect leakers to come forward honestly, not under duress. Do I support the selective leaking of information by foreign intelligence services? Nope, because the purposeful leaking of information to sway public opinion is called propaganda, and it's the most effective when it's true information. Things exist in a context.<p>Because of the context question, it's actually <i>better</i> that wikileaks dumped thousands of records. If, say, there had only been a couple hundred, folks could easily charge that the docs were hand-picked.<p>Second, and this is more important, as much as I love leaking and openness, I am not a child. Some amount of secrecy is necessary for a government to function. Salary negotiations, diplomatic memos, military threat assessments, signals intelligence -- lots of things need to be keep secret. Even if you have a complete bunch of idiots in charge of running things, that doesn't mean that <i>any</i> method used to dump <i>any</i> kind of secret information is good. And that's exactly the point the author is making in the quote above.<p>I hate to say this, and I know you guys are going to downvote me for it, but I can't help but think that this all gets back to political affiliation: if you don't like the politics, then leak the information. It's the good guys against the military-industrial complex. If you like the politics, then it's a crime to leak the information. It's the zealous idiots against the sane organization of humanity into governmental structures.<p>I don't buy any of it. Not everything has to be open, and we must have an extreme amount of more public information available in order to function intelligently as voters. Both of these views can coexist. That doesn't mean that what Wikileaks did is right: in fact if they get somebody killed? I'd view them more as another combatant rather than a player for good in all of this. I have to draw the line with leaks -- whether I like the politics or not -- with getting people killed. After all, one of the main reasons we have an executive branch is to put people in charge of making sensitive decisions based on secret information that get people killed. Looking over their shoulder every minute is not part of our role in a democracy. Checking up on them and getting as many facts as we can? Sure. But not micro-managing.<p>If the executive branch didn't have secret information and make sensitive decisions that large portions of the population didn't believe in? There would be no point in having it. The president is nothing special -- he's just another schmuck -- but he does have a defined job and he needs the tools to do that job. Secrecy is part of the tools he needs, no matter how much we wish it weren't so.",1288105055

1834431,comment,1833976,1834378,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"I am on the fence regarding the 'human nature' argument. From my personal experience, when interacting in smaller groups, people are basically good. It's only when the groups get larger that things go wrong. Also it's not as though this isn't the kind of thing that anarchist thinkers have heard and 'refuted' before.[1] I'm not sure I buy the argument, but that's one reason that 'ideals' are called such, eh?<p>> The irony of anarchism is that in almost all dimensions you are more free under a centralized government.<p>While I agree with your comment in spirit, there's a lot of real-world problems with this. Ask anyone with a minority sexuality if they feel protected by the law. And it's not just 'gay marriage' that I'm talking about, there's communities that are even further marginalized, like the polyamory community. Their lifestyle is explicitly illegal... Basically, all I'm saying is that this idea of equal protection under the law is the exact same as equal protection under anarchism: only an ideal.<p>> Like communism is the insane end of the scale for the latter, anarchism is the for former.<p>I've really come to dislike dualisms in politics, because the abstraction is always leaky. Anarchism is still a collectivist political philosophy, though it does focus a lot on the individual...<p>1: <a href=""http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secA2.html#seca215"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secA2.html#seca215</a>",1288105011

It's absolutely true, there's a lot of that going around. A large part of the 'why' is that if you're an anarchist, you probably care about politics a lot. And you feel like you have answers. And then you see things like the absolute robbery of the American people via the bank bailout, and the most you see... is some harsh words. Nobody's even upset. A single dollar lost is a tragedy, a million is a statistic. It's easy to become angry when you have very strong feelings, feel that you have answers, and then are totally ignored by most people, while you watch them make the exact mistakes you were trying to warn them about.<p>Not that any of that is an excuse; it's exactly why anarchism has continued to be marginalized. It's something that we'll have to collectively get over in order to move forward, and frankly, I'm not sure if it'll happen any time soon.<p>> thinking up scalable alternatives to government.<p>I think that one of the conclusion that you come to if you follow the anarchist line of thinking is that there is no _scalable_ alternative to government. Once you start building huge communities, the human element of humans is lost. To use the same saying twice in one post, one death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic; humans simply can't care for large numbers of other humans. Their humanity disappears. So the only way to move forward is to build a decentralized network of smaller communities, rather than yet bigger ones. The British empire fell because it was growing too large; the American one is following suit. I don't think, for example, nationalized health care can possibly work at the levels of population that America currently has. We're not only significantly larger, but much more spread out, which makes it even harder to care about what happens to those crazy people on the other coast.<p>> fun for them, but what's there to discuss?<p>It's true, there's not a lot to discuss amongst the rational, educated opponent, but here, where 'socialism' means 'The government takes my money and gives it to the black people,' we have a lot of educating to do. And once you get past the terminology, there are a lot of implementation questions. Since there have been relatively few anarchist societies[1], there are a lot of unanswered questions about how they'd be run. Then again, there's a lot of possible ways that a community could be built, and they're not all mutually exclusive. Just like different states have different laws, there are a lot of options for an anarchist community.<p>> The second category is laudible but still offers almost nothing in the way of big-picture political solutions.<p>True. I think that I've already covered that the bigger picture is a smaller picture, though.<p>1: <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/List_of_anarchist_communities"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/List_of_anarc...</a>",1288104271

In fact, I thought up the idea during a summer NYC Hackers and Founders last year. For the past 16 months, I kept trying to pick a date when NewsBlur would be ready to submit. Finally, embarrassed as I am by the bugs galore, today is that day and I am glad to say that NewsBlur is far enough along to show off.<p>NewsBlur is an RSS feed reader that tries to do two things very well:<p>1) Shows you the original site instead of a context-less feed. Read the original and NewsBlur marks the stories you've read.<p>2) Filter stories you either like or dislike. A three-stop slider goes between dislike, neutral, and like (red, yellow, and green). Training is super-easy and all click-based (as opposed to you having to writing out what you like in a site, NewsBlur asks you, semi-Hunch-style, your opinions on facets of the site).<p>I started working on NewsBlur to see if I could do it. Put the AI together with the back-end feed processing and fetching, along with the nifty front-end of the original site. This is one of those projects where I just kept pushing in all directions until I felt I had something good, not knowing if I could do it at all, but believing the entire time that I was able to complete the project.<p>If you have a project kicking around in the back of your mind, just dedicate enough weeks and months to get it done and done well. Provided you do that, you're almost guaranteed to succeed in some way. Those first few months of writing NewsBlur, I felt like a fraud, wishing I could just get threaded feed fetching to not break every few minutes. Even what I considered to be simple python gave me headaches. (Turns out threading is evil, use multiprocessing instead.)<p>NewsBlur is entirely open-source: <a href=""http://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/</a>.

You are fighting the wrong enemy.<p>Virtual machines have their own ideas about graphic hardware, and by default they show generic VESA to guest.<p>In the VMWare world, there is a ""VMWare Guest Daemon"", that combined with vmware driver adjusts the guest resolution according to VMWare settings (fit to window, etc).<p>In VirtualBox world, there should be something similar. Quick googling shows, that VBoxLinuxAdditions provides custom display driver.<p>Also note, that if a) you install guest tools without package manager and b) these guest tools do not support dkms (though VirtualBox should support it), then you will have rebuild kernel modules after each kernel upgrade! This may be your ""integration broke for some reason, I need to re-install"". Just use dkms and let the operating system worry about reinstalling drivers.<p>Regarding VirtualPC, it is broken in it's own, special ways. Sometimes I wonder that it works at all.

The word has too much baggage. Anarchists are viewed as utopians, there's been a lot of inter-faction arguing, and politics are frankly boring. The modern anarchist movement hasn't been able to connect their message to anything that's relevant. As much as I dislike CrimeThinc, they make a really good points in ""Your Politics are Boring as Fuck""[1].<p>Even if you don't think that ridding the world of rulers is a good thing, fundamentally, anarchism's message of truly caring for people still holds value. Groups like Food Not Bombs, Homes not Jails, and many cooperative organizations do a lot of good in the world. You might be surprised to find that even the Black Bloc isn't just a bunch of kids breaking things, though this is endlessly debated every time the G20 comes to town.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/selected/asfuck.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/selected/asfuck.php</a>",1288101806

Actually, it sounds like he is saying ""beef always eventually leads to poisoning"" so I don't know if your analogy holds up at all.<p>Anarchy doesn't mean no authority, it just means the least amount of justifiable authority. People always associate Anarchy with chaos and lawlessness, which is not correct.<p>We will never see an anarchy society in our lifetime, though. This is more an exercise in idealism. e.g. <i>the only type of political system that is ethically justifiable is anarchy.</i>",1288101775

In my mind, though, the huge value in NASA comes in fulfilling our species wanderlust.  The entire history of our species is filled with exploration; it is hard-wired into our DNA.  At this point, there are few places left to do that.<p>On the other hand, I keep hoping the Higgs Boson (or a discovery soon after it) will hold the key to either anti-gravity or wormholes. There is no scientific basis for this, I just want to be able to fly or jump across space. :)",1288101775

The way they determined this was a bit odd.  I'd certainly want to change where they appeared.  And I'd like a CLI equivalent, but I digress.<p>I abandoned multi-monitors in the end, because I got sick to death of the lack of keyboard control and the unpredictable nature of applications in that environment.  Too many assumptions, like me having both monitors turned on.  I'd rather think in workspaces, and be able to group apps to a workspace, or shift the menus easily to the one I was using.<p>I'm sure there are ways around it.",1288101738

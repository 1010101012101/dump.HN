3086970,comment,3086066,3086733,2,0,seven_stones,,,"That's a different question than the one you originally posed.<p>Your question was why outsourcing X was any worse than outsourcing Y or Z.<p>The answer is because different things are different.<p>As to your current question as to why <i>outsourcing</i> X is worse than <i>in-house</i> X, you're obstructing discussion by trying to preempt discussion of <i>the merits of X in the first place</i>.<p>If you don't want to get into the issue of whether software patents are good or bad, then you want to remove the only meaningful part of the discussion.<p>To use the torture example, ask yourself: Would you rather be detained in the U.S., or in Syria?  It's begging the question to assume that the outcome is the same either way, i.e. torture, death.<p>Behavior changes depending on consequences.  It's very hard to get soldiers to kill ""the enemy"" in close combat, when they can see the other person is a human being like them.  It gets easier as you increase the gulf of humanity between them; shelling from distance, or dropping bombs from altitude, or now, flying drones from complete safety with only a video screen and not the smells or screams or feeling of personal danger to the pilot.<p>Behavior tends to completely devolve when one side can engage in aggression essentially consequence-free, <i>or believes it can</i>.<p>All you have to do is look at the civility of discourse on the Internet, or appreciate the ideological battle the West has against religious martyrdom that leads to suicide bombers.  The latter is a huge concern, because you can't have a functioning society where <i>nothing</i> can dissuade destructive behavior.<p>Alternatively, patent trolls are like the introduction of an aggressive exogenic species into an ecosystem.  With no natural predators, the new species will wreak havoc on the existing balance.<p>Soon it will be more profitable to sue people than to make anything, and then making anything will just become a liability.  Much like investment bankers playing games with financial instruments to become wealthy on paper without making anything real, finance's evil twin will be patent trolls who become wealthy by <i>destroying</i> real wealth.<p><i>""If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today.""</i> - Bill Gates, 1991<p>The only way we've gotten around the standstill, to the extent we have, is via cross-licensing and mutually-assured destruction.<p>So the tl;dr to your question is: <i>Because the outsourcing in this case creates an asymmetric warfare model</i>.  The ""outsourcing"" is kind of like a ""godmode"" switch on an FPS game.  The guy who runs the server goes around fragging everyone else while invulnerable which ruins it for everyone but him.",1318045266

At least some attention to memory is neccesary to keep usage reined in. You don't have to fight for KiB, but think about it. It rather seems to be a resource you can use 5% of, but without proper attention rapidly wind up consuming 100% of.<p>2) A programmer who disposes of the idea of using memory efficiently has probably discarded the idea of algorithmic efficiently in any way whatsoever.

One of the reasons there is so much competition is that people will look at the leading players and think, ""if they can sell that for $500 then I can make a lot of money with a better and cheaper product."" This encourages a flood of really low quality education products that saturate the market and create a barrier to entry for new startups.<p>The thing most founders don't realize is that most of the revenues from high-priced products are used to fund advertising and customer acquisition strategies, so competing on price is very difficult because - ironically - it hurts your ability to scale in the short-term. This makes bootstrapping tough because if you charge the prices necessary to get users you have to compete at the same level of quality as the established players, while if you charge less you will have trouble getting users. Meanwhile, the extreme competition makes SEO near impossible (our organic search figures are dismal - our growth is ALL word of mouth).<p>This is why there is so much snakeoil in the industry: distribution trumps quality. The companies that survive tend to be the ones that take a shotgun approach to maximizing visibility rather than actually focusing on how to provide a better education. I personally believe focusing on quality at low cost IS a winning approach because once you achieve dominance you undermine the pay-to-advertise business model, but you have to figure out how to cover your costs and grow into that position organically. And this is simply not possible for startups that have expense structures that require them to get funding.<p>I've been told by public listed companies not to enter our market because they were going to own it in X years by giving away both the cow and the milk. I've seen competitor after competitor flame out because they thought getting users would be easy, produced crap and discovered that no-one came.

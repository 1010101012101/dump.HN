4819501,comment,4814249,4815656,1,0,demallien,,,"I've missed the party on this discussion, but I'm always fascinated when people make the argument you just made.  Why should software be treated differently from hardware?  Take the example of an old car engine.  The spark plugs are fired by a rotating commutator switch in the distributor cap.  The design of the commutator is patentable.  But if I was going to implement that system today, I'd simply program a simple microcontroller to fire the spark plugs in sequence.  The physical system has been replaced directly by a software system, but one is patentable, and the other isn't?<p>In short, I would answer your question with a question.  Why can hardware violate a patent and software not?",1353607186

You are trying with a straight face to tell us that there is any valid belief that this is an enforceable patent other than the incomprehensible fact that it was granted?<p>And further, if you do provide competent representation and advise me that this patent is basically null if it gets challenged, present me with the obvious prior art, etc then you believe (again with a straight face) that it is ethical behavior to, on my behalf, threaten another party unless payment is made with legal action representing what you know to be false to that party and more importantly having no legal basis for a positive outcome in any legal proceeding?<p>There is always room for improving statutes as no crafted law is a perfect instrument.  It is clear to everyone by now that the simple existence of a duly issued patent should not be considered on its own as a valid basis for litigation.  And, for the most part abuses are taking place outside of judicial purview or being forum shopped to certain favorable jurisdictions.  I take issue with the ethical lapses having no consequence, and am advocating for self-correcting behavior by the very body that has that task.<p>[0] <a href=""http://1.usa.gov/dR6UBy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1.usa.gov/dR6UBy</a>",1353607130

Such craft would be unencumbered by fuel tankage, so there would be huge potential for savings. One place to start, strangely enough, would be with electric tankers. By lifting fuel to altitude, individual aircraft fuel needs would be greatly reduced to cover the same distance, meaning structural weight could be saved, resulting in even more efficiency. Networks of power beaming stations to power cross country flights would result in aircraft so light, that parachute landing systems for the whole craft might be feasible.

4819413,comment,4818727,4819335,49,0,kmavm,,,"Hey, I'm an engineer on the HipHop team, and a minor-league Haskell enthusiast. A couple clarifications:<p>1. HipHop is itself written in C++. While this did not logically need to be the case, it is the case.<p>2. These days our JIT compiler, the HipHop VM (hhvm) is out-performing the PHP-to-C++ ahead-of-time compiler. HHVM is under the HipHop umbrella, and so is also written in C++. If you're vaguely aware that Facebook has some sort of high-performance PHP execution engine, but have avoided investigation because compiling PHP sounds like a drag, check hhvm out; it is fast, and you use it the same way you use a PHP interpreter.<p>3. HipHop is not our entire PHP stack, however, and functional languages have a significant beachhead in static analysis. pfff (<a href=""https://github.com/facebook/pfff"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/pfff</a>) is a sophisticated multi-language analysis and transformation framework written in OCaml. We use it for many, many purposes; e.g., at code review submission time, pfff symbolically executes the changed code to look for various dangerous idioms and highlight them as areas for the reviewer to focus attention.<p>4. There are other projects written in Haskell that, alas, we're not ready to talk intelligently about publicly. Watch this space, however.<p>Overall, FP has a sizable presence at Facebook. Haskell's presence is a bit smaller than OCaml, though that might be changing. Facebook is definitely ""using Haskell more these days,"" especially since Bryan O'Sullivan (author of ""Real World Haskell"") came aboard. I expect Simon Marlow will continue to influence things in that direction. From 100k feet, Facebook's adoption of Thrift, and Thrift's tradition of supporting polyglot languages, means that a lot of ""niche"" languages can flourish within the larger production ecosystem.",1353605278

It just so happens that by doing this they built something that a lot of other people also wanted and were able to execute it in such a way.

4819359,comment,4818280,4819293,20,0,bretthoerner,,,"I can't speak much to Reddit. I know they moved some things to Cassandra, but as a user I'll say I haven't been impressed with their latency and uptime since.<p>As a developer, I can speak a bit about Disqus. I don't speak on their behalf, but I did work there for two years (ironically I was also the first to use Redis there[1]) so I can at least explain why I think using Redis for the whole site is a terrible idea. I'll also note upfront that where I currently work we use a ton of Cassandra, Redis, and very little MySQL on the side, so hopefully I won't be pegged as some kind of ""RDBMS only"" guy.<p>Anyway, some reasons:<p>1) Relational data. Disqus really <i>is</i> relational. You have users, user have posts, posts belong to a thread, threads belong to sites, sites belong to an account (imagine one account for the different CNN websites). And that's a very, very small subset of the number of tables and foreign keys involved. People don't realize how many features Disqus really has above and beyond ""post a text blob to a thread.""<p>Being able to write a query that uses joins is huge. The alternative in Redis/Cassandra is having to denormalize your data into every single possible way you may want to do a ""query"" on later. Oh, by the way, I promise you will forget a few ways and regret having to backfill/fix all the broken denormalizations.<p>Even if you don't forget to denormalize anything upfront, the biggest joke k/v and document stores ever played on the developer community was convincing them that they save development time by being ""schema free"". When Disqus wants to add a new feature it's often only a new JOIN/INDEX away. If you realize a year into your Redis deployment that you want to be able to tell a user how many comments they made per month in the year... what do you do? In Postgres you hit the datetime column index and call it a day.<p>2) Memory (and cost). The Disqus network is actually pretty huge. Storing the entire dataset in RAM (Redis) would cost a lot more than using an efficient DB like Postgres that is a pro at moving data between disk and RAM. Cassandra would work better than Redis here, but the other problems I list still hold.<p>Also, as soon as you have to break from one Redis instance to two (either to scale CPU or to live on another box to increase available RAM) you lose a lot of server-side functionality like being able to union sets, or use the embedded Lua to fake 'queries' because now you have keys that live on seperate systems. Before anyone says you should shard by ""site"", see my link below. I did just that, but you have to understand that Disqus is more than just ""comments for my website"". Say you shard by website, now how do I run a do a union across sets that involve a single user who has posted to 100 different websites? I can't. Back to backfilling and denormalizing tons of data that also needs to be resident in RAM and kept in sync.<p>---<p>I could add more, but I just realized that the linked talk probably spoke about the big sharded Postgres K/V type store that they built. Here's the thing: all of the core stuff (like from point 1) isn't stored in there. It's used when it can be, for scalability, but the majority of the app is still in a behemoth Postgres instance that is replicated many times over. As to why not use Redis for <i>that</i> part? I'd say because it's memory only and because Disqus has Postgres expertise. Also, it's not truly ""key value"" because it still has indexes for say, datetimes or post_id or site_id which make doing a lot of non-relational queries handy without having to denormalize. Now, why not use Cassandra for that? Well, I would. :)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/bretthoerner/blog/blob/master/2011/2/21/redis-at-disqus.rst"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bretthoerner/blog/blob/master/2011/2/21/r...</a>",1353604205

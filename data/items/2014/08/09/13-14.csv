8156884,comment,8156786,8156871,4,0,dalke,,,"It doesn&#x27;t say that Dvorak is better than QWERTY. It links to an article in The Atlantic titled &quot;The Lies You&#x27;ve Been Told About the Origin of the QWERTY Keyboard&quot;. Quoting from it, which quotes from elsewhere:<p>> ... the QWERTY system emerged as a result of how the first typewriters were being used. Early adopters and beta-testers included telegraph operators who needed to quickly transcribe messages. However, the operators found the alphabetical arrangement to be confusing and inefficient for translating morse code. The Kyoto paper suggests that the typewriter keyboard evolved over several years as a direct result of input provided by these telegraph operators<p>That&#x27;s why the Slate article says &quot;the QWERTY keyboard was designed for a different age (to suit the quirks of telegraph operators)&quot;, and does not refer to the myth about key-sticking.<p>(Personally, I thought the same as you, and it required a closer reading to understand that my thought was incorrect.)<p>The discussion about mental arithmetic concerns conversions between different scales, like foot and mile, not in fractions of a foot. If you have a surveyor&#x27;s wheel marked in feet or half-rods and want to measure 1/4 mile -- how long is that?<p>That said, see my other post for aspects about this article that I didn&#x27;t like.",1407592777

8156882,comment,8155832,8156568,7,0,tel,,,"Exceptions in Haskell simply are not the same as in other languages. In particular, they probably should only ever occur in IO code.<p>Why? Because right now you spend a lot of time trying to reason about non-local jumps in code due to exceptions. Purr Haskell code frees you from that concern by making everything local and explicit.<p>You have to learn a new style, but once you do going back to pervasive exceptions is a pain! It&#x27;s really hard to trust code that might bubble up an exception at any point.<p>Finally, I&#x27;ve found that the times I genuinely want bubbling exceptions are exclusively IO scenarios anyway. Touching the real world is when you&#x27;re likely to need to handle partial coverage of behavior amyay.<p>So it all matches up and is wonderful, but is also quite different from what you might normally expect. In particular, you need to learn how to think about and reason within pure code—once you learn that you&#x27;ll find that predicting the right type signatures is easy. They just explain exactly what your function really does.<p>---<p>Here&#x27;s a great /r/Haskell thread on the topic of modern error handling style: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2csaml/are_there_any_new_developments_in_the_last_seven/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2csaml/are_there_an...</a>",1407592659

We have an entire industry built up not just around wine, but around _tasting_ wine - judging it, speaking about it, writing about it, etc. It seems that, while some wine will certainly be better than others, the degree of difference from one quality wine to the next, and the amount of significance we ascribe to it is where the debate should really lie.",1407592380
8156879,comment,8149198,8150286,1,0,m_mueller,,,"I wonder whether you&#x27;re dismissing today&#x27;s GPUs too quickly. The way they work (and are programmed) today is about half way between CPUs and the linked architecture. They&#x27;re generally applicable for an order of 10E3 parallel computations, with 10E5-10E6 threads they can be saturated. Whether you have computationally bounded or memory bandwidth bounded algorithms doesn&#x27;t really matter (both is faster on GPU), what matters is a sufficiently long runtime for the parallelizable part of an application as well as not too much branching for computationally bounded kernels (there is a point where CPUs become faster when there&#x27;s too many branches since for example on Kepler architecture for each branch, the neighbouring 192 cores are locked together).<p>The philosophy of today&#x27;s GPU architecture is basically quite simple: Maximize memory throughput by using the fastest RAM that&#x27;s still cheap enough for consumers, then maximize die space for the ALUs by letting bundles of them share scheduler, register blocks and cache. I was first very skeptical about this too, but to my experience it has proven quite effective - even parallel algorithms that are not ideal for this architecture still profit from the raw power, and they continue getting benefits when you buy new cards, in a fashion that&#x27;s much closer to Moore&#x27;s law than CPUs develop.<p>The architecture certainly isn&#x27;t ideal and would be solved by an architecture like in your link (to which Parallela also comes quite close btw), and I can well imagine that this is where we&#x27;re heading given another 5-10 years (see Parallela, to some extent Knight&#x27;s Landing). However it&#x27;s also feasible that the GPU&#x27;s ALU maximisation game will win out, especially once 3D-stacked memory comes into play.<p>Since 2008 there have been many papers about NNs implemented on GPU and I&#x27;d love to know what&#x27;s the current status there, especially compared to the very powerful Power8 architecture.",1407592372

According to an early definition, &quot;It is ordained that 3 grains of barley dry and round do make an inch, 12 inches make 1 foot, 3 feet make 1 yard.&quot;<p>Who here has an idea of the size of a grain of barley dry and round?<p>At 39.3 inches, a meter is just slightly longer than a yard, and for &quot;traditional purposes&quot; where the sternum/fingertip approximation is good enough, a meter and a yard can be used almost interchangeably.<p>Somehow all those people using metric in their daily lives don&#x27;t feel like they are missing something special by having &quot;ancient, organic&quot; units. (BTW, at what point does something become &quot;ancient&quot;?)<p>&quot;Or don’t bother, because the definition completely changed in 1960&quot;<p>The yard definition &#x27;completely changed&#x27; in 1959, when it defined as exactly 0.9144 meters. Before then it was different in different countries.<p>Since the yard is pegged to the meter, this means that the yard is now legally defined as the time light travels in 1/274130223.5952 seconds.<p>&quot;The first third of the 20th century, for instance, saw some quite serious efforts to rationalize our systems for dates and times.&quot;<p>As well as the 1700s, when France ran under a rationalized calendar, which provided the name for the Thermidorian Reaction. This is part of the same movement that brought us the metric system, so I think it&#x27;s odd to exclude that very serious effort.",1407592093

Or as a sommelier knows it, rather.<p>I like wine generally, but most of what I know of it comes from the documentary Somm, (on Netflix) - a sommelier&#x27;s job is to tell a story - and to do this s/he must very knowledgeable and articulate about wine, its history, and its present. The history is basically a memory test, tasting wine is articulating what the drinker might experience in words, and having a palate honed enough to determine exactly what the wine is and where it&#x27;s from.<p>All three, except the articulation, are verifiable quantitative tests. Even the during articulation the sommelier cannot stray too far from what is conventionally accepted.<p>I&#x27;m not harping too much on the sommelier service test, because the article is about wine tasting, but other sides apply. People train themselves to learn about wines in detail, and to differentiate wines right down to the highest level of classification and regionality just by just smell and taste alone.",1407591942

Given Google&#x27;s long term efforts around SSL it would be a good fit.<p>The off hand remark about SSLSocketConnection not checking hostnames even though it has all the data it needs is a bit worrying. Does UrlConnection on Android do the right thing with respect to SSL URLs? It should do, I hope!",1407589897

I probably don&#x27;t succeed in this goal all of the time, so your feedback is very useful for me in rethinking how a user progresses through the exercises.

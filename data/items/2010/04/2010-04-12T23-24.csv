Who cares? Companies are allowed to make the world a better place without having to self-flagellate themselves.

Several companies, most notably Apple, have already spent what must be millions of dollars on licensing fees and hardware. Regardless of which is a better long-term choice, it can be very difficult to reverse that much momentum.

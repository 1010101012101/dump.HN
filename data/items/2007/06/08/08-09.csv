26862,comment,26807,26807,0,0,staunch,,,"My favorite coding ""high"" is sleep deprivation mixed with dangerous levels of caffeine. I'll sometimes work until ~5AM and be really tired, then get a ""second wind"" and be wide-awake until the afternoon coding like I'm on speed.<p>There's also the excited ""holy crap this is cool"" high, which is more like a tingling giddiness at how interesting something  is. Like a child who can't sit still the night before Christmas. Nothing motivates me more than this feeling.<p>\n",1181293021

You could make it really easy for users to say to developers ""If I can get 20 other people to pay $100/ea will you implement this feature?""<p>Let them create really simple polls, without much registration or anything. Pretty informal. Maybe a ""stage 1"" poll and then move to a payment-verified ""stage 2"" poll if there was a good response for the informal poll.<p>I think the 1000 x $5 is not realistic. Most of the time when I need something created it's for a business and I have hundreds/thousands of dollars to available. I've underwritten  projects for tens of thousands of dollars and would love to share the load. I'd go for a smaller number of bigger buyers, even if it seems less interesting. Business-related software because consumers are cheap bastards.<p>",1181292435

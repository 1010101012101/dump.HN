459307,comment,458940,459269,0,0,silencio,,,"For me, opentable pretty much dominates as the one stop for restaurant reservations and makes my dinner date planning go much faster when used together with yelp for those nights we want to go somewhere nice and impossible to get seated reasonably without a reservation. But I'm in Los Angeles (and a quick glance shows 300+ restaurants on opentable within a half hour driving distance, and around 700 in the general LA/OC area).<p>However, most restaurants out there are probably not large or popular enough that you'll want or need to make a reservation, and you can just walk right in and get seated. Among the ones interested in doing reservations for more than just special occasions and large groups, even less would have to be interested in the hardware, software, training and more that they need to work with opentable. And then customers have to be interested in making reservations there in the first place.<p>Obviously there are a lot more than 59 restaurants in Oregon and 700 in Los Angeles, but  the number isn't as small as it seems at first glance when considering the number of restaurants that benefit from such a service.",1233384931

459303,comment,459248,459294,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"At DjangoCon, Mark Ramm warned against Django's ""Z shaped learning curve"".  And, he's exactly right.  Getting Django installed, pointed at your database, and opening up the admin is a joy.  After, that, you have to roll up your sleeves and start learning.<p>It really takes a while to get used to the work-flow:  Design a URL, created your model, created a view to push the data through to the template, design the template.  Then, there's the Generic views, which are a whole other language to learn.  After you get up to speed, it makes development a whole lot easier, but from the bottom of the ""Z"" to the top of the ""Z"" it takes a lot of struggling.",1233384752

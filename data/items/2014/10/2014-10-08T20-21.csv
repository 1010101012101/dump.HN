8429438,comment,8429145,8429145,0,0,idlewords,,,"This is a strange piece of writing. Two things stand out in particular:<p>First, it paints Von Braun as a visionary hero doing what it took to survive during the war, under pain of death. Von Braun&#x27;s moral position was much more problematic than this. The best you can say about his stance during the war is that he was not an ideologue, but an opportunist. Holding him up as an example of moral courage is a perversion of history. &quot;I aim at the stars (but sometimes I hit London).&quot;  There are excellent biographies of Von Braun that go into rich detail about his conduct during the war.<p>Second, the article argues that Korolev and Von Braun somehow manipulated their respective countries into funding their dreams of human spaceflight.  Given the obvious military applications of rockets that could launch large payloads into orbit, and the huge advantage this technology would give any nuclear power over its rivals, the suggestion that human space flight would not have happened in the 1960&#x27;s without these dreamers is fantasy.<p>Military planners at this stage of the Cold War were thinking seriously about armed space stations (and the Soviet Union in fact built one).  Moreover, questions of who could put a human being in orbit first, and who could put people on the moon, were universally recognized as prestigious technological achievements with immense propaganda value.",1412801921

8429419,comment,8424696,8428967,0,0,gldsmth,,,"> There&#x27;s a third choice - don&#x27;t buy the games that violate your privacy and don&#x27;t play them. You&#x27;ve pointed out great ways to support developers that don&#x27;t violate privacy (GOG.com, Kickstarter) - why not stick only to these? Unless, your urge to play a video game is bigger than your integrity.<p>I support these options when they are available. But when you have a certain taste for specific niche of games, sometimes there is no alternative. Kickstarter has managed to bring back the classic top down, turn based party RPGs, which is fantastic, but I haven&#x27;t seen any developer try to bring genres like RPG sandbox (ala Skyrim) or grid based, turn based dungeon crawlers (MMXL, which has one of the most annoying DRM, is the first game to be released in the genre in decades) to Kickstarter yet.<p>Sure, I&#x27;m making a dent on my integrity by buying these games but I don&#x27;t see it as a great evil as long as we&#x27;re still able to fight against privacy-invading schemes. If that option was no longer there, I would stop playing these games. I also feel that the developers deserve the support, they aren&#x27;t responsible for the publishers requirements. I don&#x27;t wish for them to go out of business, I&#x27;m optimistic that the growing success of Kickstarter and gog as a platform might change their mind in the long term, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all black & white where we either support kickstarter or support DRM published games.<p>I&#x27;ll remind you that many of the current great kickstarter developers come from a classic DRM supporting background. Obsidian, for example. Their last RPG, Fallout New Vegas, depended on Steam as their DRM. They saw the success of kickstarter, started their own project on it (Pillars of Eternity), succeeded in crowdfunding it and might end up relying more often on crowdfunding their games in the future. Pillars of Eternity will be DRM-free.<p>Now the question is, do you think it would&#x27;ve been better if no one had bought their games before? You think it would have been better if they had gone out of business? I do not believe so. PoE exists today because Obsidian could afford to build itself as a studio and recruit some of the best developers of the genre.<p>Showing support for crowdfunding, buying games on gog.com will help these developers free themselves from the shackles of the bad publishers. Boycotting developers that are still kept in shackles will not do anything but destroy their livelihood. Particularly as publishers are very likely to blame piracy when the games don&#x27;t sell well.<p>The fact that a lot of pre-established developers are turning to crowdfunding bodes well for the future in my mind.",1412801772

8429412,comment,8427086,8428818,0,0,theothermkn,,,"This is the strangest folk non-explanation of lift I&#x27;ve ever encountered.<p>> So the wind is actually pulling the sail, not pushing it.<p>A handy distillation of fluid dynamics is, &quot;Just like you can&#x27;t push string, you can&#x27;t suck fluids.&quot; That is, fluids don&#x27;t resist in tension except in very particular very dynamic conditions that are wholly outside of the realms where our intuitions are developed. It looks like you&#x27;ve inadvertently modified the popular &quot;Bernoulli&#x27;s Principle&quot; theory of lift, which was wrong even before you modified it.<p>There&#x27;s no real point in doing anything like a rebuttal, so let me do the best I can, instead, to explain how lift is actually developed and how that applies to the case of a sailing vessel.<p>The fundamental thing that makes lift possible is the Kutta condition. This states that a real fluid has to leave a cusp in the direction that the cusp faces. There are complicated reasons for this having to do with velocity gradients, viscosity, radius of curvature of the flow, and even relativity, but the layperson can observe, feel, or take on faith that a flow leaves an edge in a direction parallel to the edge. This fact literally turns the flow and results in lift. (Historically and physically, we say that the Kutta condition resolves D&#x27;Lambert&#x27;s Paradox via the Kutta-Jukowski theory of lift, if you want some keywords to look up more information.)<p>So, the direction of the trailing edge of the flow turns the flow. There are two ways that we can examine the result of this: momentum or pressure. It turns out that they give the exact same result for the lift of an airfoil, but are &quot;intuitive&quot; in different ways. The momentum theory just says, &quot;Lift is just a force that is accounted for by the mass of the air that you&#x27;re pushing aside. This is what you typically might call &#x27;downwash&#x27;,&quot; but a bit more mathematically. The pressure theory says, &quot;Look, that&#x27;s all fine, but that force is experienced as a pressure distribution on a surface, because the only part of the wing that&#x27;s in the flow is the surface. Let&#x27;s keep track of (integrate) the pressure over the surface and see what the resulting forces are,&quot; but also a bit more mathematically.<p>So, take your pick of intuitions: Imagine a wing throwing air or fluid aside, or imagine it experiencing a pressure difference from top to bottom. They&#x27;re both true, and are just different ways of accounting for the same phenomenon, different procedures for accounting for forces and masses as they interact with &quot;control volumes,&quot; as engineers and physicists like to say. And remember that both intuitive explanations are driven by the Kutta condition, which is far more interesting, I think, than the erroneous Bernoulli explanation.<p>So, that&#x27;s lift. I turn a flow and I get a reaction force. Peachy. How does it apply to sailboats?<p>Other than the buoyancy force and gravity, every force that we care about on a sailboat is due to the operation of a foil (hydrofoil or airfoil) within a fluid (water or air). The hull of the boat, the rudder, and the keel act like wings of (typically very low) efficiency. Their total lift acts to resist the downwind drift of the boat in the water. The sail acts as a wing. Depending on the point of sail, the lift of the wing acts more or less, literally, in the direction of travel of the boat. (Close to the wind, the majority of the lift is actually wasted in heeling the boat over and trying to slide it downwind.)<p>I know I said that a rebuttal would be unproductive, but there are a few things I suddenly can&#x27;t resist.<p>> However, the flat keel underwater prevents the boat from sliding downwind, with the result that the boat is forced forward.<p>The &quot;flat keel&quot; is a wing. It prevents this &quot;slide&quot; via lift. It&#x27;s also not helpful to split the analysis into &#x27;forces&#x27; and &#x27;constraints&#x27;. The keel produces lift that is a fore that contributes to the balance of forces on the vessel, resulting in motion.<p>> [The wind] is split into two turbulent streams, one on each side of the sail.<p>Turbulence is a complete red herring, here. Turbulence has nothing to do with lift (other than causing stalls and complicating the analysis).<p>> Some of the lifting force is counterbalanced by the keel underwater keeping the boat upright.<p>Well...the center of mass of the entire boat levered, as it is, upwind of the center of buoyancy, produces a moment that counteracts the moment of the sail&#x27;s lift.<p>> For instance, a sailboat is not powered by the wind pushing on the sail.<p>It kind of really is. It&#x27;s just more complicated because analyzing fluids requires that we analyze continua, and not just discrete particles. In the end, though, sailboats sail because they exchange momentum with the atmosphere and the water through distributed forces, or pressures.",1412801652

In the real world, a lot of people are listening to their iPod earbuds while walking down a busy streets and have less than perfect hearing, which completely negates a lot of the hard work that the studio engineers put into the mastering process.<p>Look at any live event where audio plays a big role - you almost always have a sound engineer leveling and remixing sound, so that the little details shine through as the environment changes constantly. We&#x27;re automating that process , and bringing it to your phone, so you can enjoy great sound no matter where you are.<p>Speaking to the speakers specifically, we&#x27;ve done a lot of work with our DSP engine and acoustics to really reinforce the sound in the low 200 - 300 Hz range, which is where a lot of the warmth perception comes from. There are a lot of really cool acoustical tricks you can play with resonances and backflow volumes - its not just the speaker driver itself, but what you do with the enclosure and the volume behind the speaker that makes a huge difference.",1412801226

There likely is a correlation on what century you learned programming, but certainly one whether you have experience with pascal-ish languages.<p>People educated in the Wirth way would say &quot;that&#x27;s not a for loop; there is no way to tell how often it will iterate when it is first entered&quot; and write it as a while loop.<p>Old-school C programmers seem to think one iteration construct is enough for everybody and like to write any iteration as a for loop, ideally with a few commas and no actual statements, as in the classic strcpy:<p><pre><code>  char *strcpy(char *dst, CONST char *src)
  {
    char *save = dst; 
    for (; (*dst = *src) != &#x27;\0&#x27;; ++src, ++dst);

The first constraint is memory; the microcontroller world is full of very powerful chips that can only address a few kilobytes of memory. Using a chip capable of running any sort of Linux kernel means limiting yourself to chips that cost at least 5-10 times more than other chips, plus the added cost of RAM, plus the design costs associated with the extra chips and discrete components, etc. Second, you are limiting what you can do with the chip; Linux, for example, has no support for being an SPI slave device, so if that&#x27;s part of your design requirements, you now have to start writing your own kernel drivers for something that&#x27;s almost always built into other OSes/frameworks for microcontrollers.<p>Finally, for many tasks, your code will end up being more complicated. Because power consumption tends to be crucial in a lot of designs, you want to spend as much time as possible sleeping, waking up only to handle whatever event you received. As such, most microcontroller frameworks have excellent support for event/interrupt-centric programming, where a device will only wake up long enough to handle the input at hand before going back to sleep. Linux just doesn&#x27;t have the apis needed to support this sort of behavior well, which means you either need a proper real-time microkernel under Linux to handle your i/o, or you&#x27;re going to be stuck putting all of your operations in kernel space, negating the point of Linux.<p>In short, stating Linux should be the default is short-sighted and neglects a lot of what is going on in the systems that mbed is focusing on. Trying to wedge it in, or even think of wedging it in, is going to make your device more expensive, and less useful, than using the right tool for the job from the get-go. All the world does not need to be Linux.",1412799705

Your system is divided into event-manager threads which communicate with each other using events(and of course interrupts create events). When they are activated by an event , they do their stuff rapidly - and go to sleep. Only a single thread is allowed at a time. There are also event priorities to manage a case of multiple events happening at the same time, and a scheduler to manage that.<p>This enables both low power systems(since both threads and scheduler are always asleep unless there&#x27;s a new event - unlike traditional rtos, where usually the scheduler needs to wake up periodically quit often to check which process&#x27;s turn is now and give it to him).<p>And since threads are run to completion, you only need a single stack(instead of stack per task), which saves a lot of ram, which is critical in those kinds of systems, both in terms of price and in terms of sleep power(since even in sleep you need to power the ram and the smaller the ram the better) which usually is the biggest component in total power consumption.",1412799244

</code></pre>
then override with a new pointer from fopen if necessary.<p>In fact, looking at this more closely, note how fp is scoped to the body of the for loop. That&#x27;s where it should be defined:<p><pre><code>   for (firsttime = 1; ; firsttime = 0) {
     FILE *fp = stdin;

     /* logic flips it to fp = fopen(...) as necessary */

   }
</code></pre>
[Note: the C compiler Joy was working with probably didn&#x27;t support block scope declarations except at the top of the function. This comment applies to merging the fix using the environment of today.]<p>Note how the fclose at the bottom of the loop ends up closing stdin in the case that fp == stdin! It ensures that this only happens once, but you have to analyze it to see that this is true.  I would write this as:<p><pre><code>     if (fp != stdin) /* defensive! */
       fclose(fp);
</code></pre>
Making it an infinite loop terminated by calling exit is unnecessary. There is already a continue in the loop, and a break in an inner loop; another break instead of the exit, and a &quot;return status;&quot; at the bottom wouldn&#x27;t hurt. Better yet:<p><pre><code>  /* Enter loop whenever there are args left to
     process, or even if there are no args if it is
     the first time through (to process stdin instead). */

  for (firsttime = 1; firsttime || *argv; firsttime = 0) {
    FILE *fp = stdin;

    if (*argv) {
       /* have args; do the fopen to replace stdin */
       /* set status = 1 and continue if cannot fopen */
    }

    /* do head logic */

    if (fp != stdin)

(And products meaning physical and digital...the same, truly). In essence, I believe we need to approach and begin to explore the ways in which we will deal with extra &quot;junk&quot; creations that were produced in route to a final, complete release. Those eager to enjoy the beauty of what was done as well as those who are eager to &quot;see what it looks like&quot; could cause garages and external drives to start filling up with gook that could be potentially hazardous...without them even knowing it, or intending to have caused or created this or that concocted combination of properties. For these reasons, down the line, we could see the imploding of retail sales on items such as clothing and small electronics/cords/connectors, etc....and with that, people creating imperfect items...those that are slightly off, and thus, in American culture, discarded. To date, the idea of &quot;print that document again, this one has a typo&quot;...has only equalled a few extra sheets of paper used and recycled. In the coming years? Imagine that extra sheet of scratch paper you threw away being a larger, albeit more resource-intensive....item. Should people be viewed as hasty when they do this? Or should we admire their innovation attempt and determination? I feel the latter is important. The kicker is that we make sure that those who are developing and rendering product and code...understand waste and the importance of getting it right...and THEN releasing. Thus...the availability of tools/makers/equipment...and in fact, raw materials...be limited and monitored. Not just anyone can claim a domain and see what happens. Life must progress and code must grow as designed by God from the start. He&#x27;s got it all under control, aren&#x27;t we glad, however, to be a part of the grand beta, however? I know I am.

In fact, the vast majority of debt involves no such person - a lending contract is often undertaken electronically.  What they will show is the contractual agreement of terms with your signature (physical or electronic).  The original lender will not be there and in fact no longer &quot;owns&quot; the debt, having sold it to a collector.  Even the collection agency won&#x27;t be there, they generally hire someone locally (you must be sued in your location, not theirs) to be present in civil court.<p>On point #2, also false.  Bad debt impacts your FICO score - often severely - but that impact is lessened with time.  A 90-day or 120-day late (effectively a charge off) can ding a score 20 - 150 points easily depending on other credit factors.  Shrugging your shoulders and saying &quot;this won&#x27;t be that bad&quot; is not a good policy.

Specifically, the last 4 digits must be visually validated on the card and typed in to avoid cloned cards (chips largely solve this) in most stores.<p>Furthermore, giving a new CC number to each transaction is going to deplete the pool of available CC numbers rather soon (as im sure everyone knows, CC number is not just random collection of 16 numbers 0-9).<p>As other people pointed out, this solves a non-problem: if i don&#x27;t want to be liable for a fraudulent purchase, i just use a credit card, not a debit card. In case of CC fraud, it is the MERCHANT who is responsible, not the customer or the bank.<p>Monitoring software that flags &quot;odd&quot; purchases is all that&#x27;s needed - and banks have been running such things for ages.<p>Yes, there is hassle if your CC gets lifted/swiped, but chances are, its not an evil hacker doing it, but that cute waitress at your local bar with a $30 ghost reader in her hand.<p>Unless the physical card generates a new number on EACH swipe, it is just another example of technology looking to complicate an otherwise streamlined process.<p>/rant over :)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cardbenefits.citi.com/Products/Virtual-Account-Numbers.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cardbenefits.citi.com/Products/Virtual-Account-N...</a>

118198,comment,118174,118174,0,0,Tygerdave,,,"I find the only startups that I'm being drawn into are the ones with creative founders.  The two that come to mind are Wesabe and now TipJoy, both are sites that launched when they had built enough to be useful, but still have a lot of interesting potential.  You can just look at Google's share price if you want proof that users love potential and expect change and improvements.",1203353637

There should be a page there but I just realised that I didn't port that page over from the development site.<p>3.odd you should get a message box telling you what fields you missed. what browser are you on? also if you have JS off it should just change pages and display a list of missing fields.<p>4. Sorry yeah this is explained in the missing about us page. I did it because I wanted people to get to the point and make the site viewable in a mobile with no modifying.<p>5. yeah thats standard wordpress funcationality I will fix it.",1203353528

I'd like to see a study on this.<p>On the other hand, it would be very interesting to see the ""past performance"" of these J.P. Morgan whiz kids claiming that they always come out ahead of their reference indexes. Past performance corrected for buyouts of successful funds.",1203353404

What do you suppose this could be used for or how would it change your programming?<p>Off the top of my head, I suppose if you had these functions, it'd be much easier to write machine learning algorithms that are based on statistical methods.  In addition, you'd be able to write code that branches randomly, but based on a distribution built from user interactions.  Anyone have any others?",1203352913

Feel free to blame hubris.  The second-most-trusted entity for me is ""the market"".<p>Lately I've taken that to an extreme, and I've even backed away from choosing individual stocks.  I've met multiple CEOs over years and a small fraction have struck me as having any sort of intellectual horsepower.<p>Instead, I'm betting on my startup (as close to under my control as anything can be) and retirement money goes into index funds.<p>I feel like this bounds the problem!",1203352728

118183,comment,118138,118138,0,0,iamwil,,,"I found myself in a self-imposed crunch mode this weekend.  I had a preconceived notion in my mind how much I was going to be able to accomplish this weekend, and when my estimates were far off (what was estimated to be 6 hours of work were actually 18), I got impatient, thinking that I SHOULD have finished hours ago.<p>I ended up not doing things the right way, and merely plowed ahead, until I got it to work.  However, after the relief of finally getting it done, I have to go back and spend some time refactoring and cleaning up the mess that I made.  I often have to remind myself that good engineering simply takes time, and will save in the long run.",1203351949

118181,comment,115158,115869,0,0,Retric,,,"I think there is value to looking at anecdotes because the average collage student is better connected and more intelligent than those who skip it. Most of my friends have collage degrees.  Of those who don't one was making 120k/year before he died. One charges 100$+ per hour and is constantly booked. And the last guy is 29 and makes 140k / year at yahoo.  IMO a large reason for the disparity in lifetime earnings between those with a collage degree and those without are the type of people who go to collage.<p>For most people staying in school is probably a good idea. But, when your options are to stay in school or drop out and make 70+k / year staying in school seems less useful. Would these people make more money in 5 years with a collage degree well possibly, but they are making good money now and investments compound with time so it would have to be a huge increase to be worth it.<p>PS: Doctors get paid a lot latter in life but on average they donâ€™t retire younger than most people.",1203351747

118179,comment,118106,118106,0,0,1gor,,,"I have always been surprised why TextMate rather than Emacs has got all of the mindshare in Rails developer community.<p>'emacs-rails' mode had the same rails-specific navigation, snippet-expansion etc. features two years ago and has improved greatly since then. (See screencast: <a href=""http://emacsonrails.drozdov.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emacsonrails.drozdov.net</a> for example)<p>I've tried to follow the crowd initially and to learn TextMate, but then... why learning new set of keystrokes? And why reimplementing a fraction of editing modes that emacs has available? When you can have... So I went back, but I am still puzzled by majority of Rails programmers choosing to support TextMate. Matz uses emacs after all...",1203351732

118176,comment,118154,118154,0,0,iamwil,,,"Seems similar in plot to that book outlining pickup artists (PUAs) in ""The Game"".  In that book, PUAs were also teaching students in the LA area, and it got to a point where their students were mimicking all their best lines, thus rendering their teachers' routines ineffective.  I figure the same story will play out here.<p>If women respond to making them laugh, then like comedians, being original has all its perks.",1203351333

I doubt any CEO's were fooled by talk like ""savings per hectoliter""; these are diplomatic people who probably just tried to give a game response to a seemingly clueless analyst.  If someone says something stupid in a setting like this - you don't waste the time of the other people on the call by calling them out or trying to figure out what their gibberish means, you do what these guys did -- hit your closest pre-existing talking point and defer further discussion to a later time.<p>It's amazing the lengths some people will go to reinforce their worldview in which all executives and finance professionals are clueless PHB's who somehow got to the corner office by crashing tricycles or something.",1203351233

It's probably more now, given the increase in value of precious metals, but the last time I checked, about 3-4 years ago, a silver dime was worth a quarter.",1245563874
667163,comment,666809,666943,0,0,jacobolus,,,"I find that a Model M allows much <i>softer</i> typing than other keyboards, and much more predictable.  If you're pounding the keys you're doing it wrong.<p>(This is precisely the point of having a resistance curve that is very easy through the part of the keypress where the actual contact is made, and then increases smoothly so that pushing the key all the way down is neither necessary nor desirable.  It lets you <i>not</i> jam the keys down, and even gives you aural and tactile feedback to let you know when you’ve pressed the key far enough.)<p>(Edit: here's some images for the happy hacking keyboard; I'm sure I've seen this in English, but I'm not sure where. <a href=""http://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/hhkeyboard/leaflet/keyspec.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/hhkeyboard/leaflet/keyspec.html</a> )",1245563835

There are tons of people in the sciences with very interesting lives, they just don't have people knocking down their door to write popular biographies like Feynman, Erdös, or Tesla.<p>I say that living mathematicians like John Nash Jr., Shing-tung Yau, and Alexander Grothendieck have much more interesting lives than the examples you mentioned.",1245563284

The only reasonable obligation on Jobs is to announce that he won't be performing his duties for some period. He did that.<p>You should care as much about his wishes for privacy as you do for his well-being <i>because they are one and the same</i>. There are a multitude of reasons someone might want to keep their health challenges private, including concerns over how young children will be able to deal with scary-sounding information (especially once it gets filtered through the rumor mill). There's no morality in rumor-mongering.",1245563170

Do you think this ""fault"" justifies the response ""I'm overjoyed that I actually hurt your feelings.  I wish I could hurt your feelings so much you would commit suicide"" etc. etc.?<p>* I agree that Erik wrote a very violent mail, but I am sure he was not serious. *<p>Huh? Please cite even one sentence from his mail that was in the least bit lighthearted or joking. If you sent this email to someone today, the police would be at your doorstep within hours.<p>* Did you read Xah Lee's mail too? *<p>Yes, he sounds like a psychopath.<p>There's no way a sane person can read that thread and come to the conclusion that Erik was the good guy there. I don't mean to jump on the bash Erik bandwagon, since I know nothing about him other than what's been written in this forum. Whatever his contributions were to the hacker community, that thread was obviously not his finest hour.",1245562157

667142,comment,666809,666968,0,0,lincolnq,,,"$300 is _nothing_ if you type for a living and it can save you from chronic wrist pain. I've had my Kinesis for a year. I was suffering from a good amount of pain, especially in my pinkies. It evaporated in about two days once I started using my Kinesis. Now I only get pain if I switch back to my old keyboard (it comes back in a few hours) or if I type for 8 hours straight or with bad posture.<p>Highly recommended.",1245560889

Opps!<p>I think it's time for some sleep...as should probably always be the case when you loose the ability to differentiate words... :D",1245560751
667139,comment,667102,667102,0,0,patio11,,,"Here's an anecdote for you: I am generally religious about reducing the length of funnels, because length kills conversion like nothing else.  This lead me to once let the customers make two choices with one click: whether they wanted download or CD of the software, and whether they wanted to pay by Paypal or Google Checkout.  The four combinations were laid out in a 2x2 table.<p>This proved <i>immensely</i> confusing for people, so much so that adding a shopping cart on top of two bare ""download"" or ""CD"" buttons caused sales to rise substantially, despite the fact that the shopping cart was a virtual riot of distraction and required minimally an extra click to get through.",1245560628

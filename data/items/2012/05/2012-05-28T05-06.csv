Messenger
Movie Maker
Photo Gallery
etc.<p>It actually has some decent products and it <i>sort of</i> made sense to group them into a brand. I like what they're doing with Win8 though.<p>I do find it funny that Microsoft is backtracking though. Windows Vista shipped with all these windows live apps and then Windows 7 removed them from the OS and made them an optional download through ""Windows Live Essentials"". This was meant to ""un-bloat"" the operating system. Now it seems Microsoft wants to take away the Live branding and bundle them with the OS again.<p>Whhhattteevveerrrr<p>btw does anyone still use MSN/Windows Live Messenger?",1338184785

4032148,story,,,1,0,24x7esubmission,"Female Infertility Diagnosis",http://www.wewantababy.com,"Infertility is a condition that affects approximately one out of every six couples. An infertility diagnosis is given to a sexually active couple that has been unsuccessful in efforts to conceive not using any birth control,over the course of one full year. When the cause of infertility exists within the female partner, it is referred to as female infertility. About 40% of cases are due to female factors,30% are due to male factors, 20% are a combination of both, and in about 10% the cause is unknown. Female infertility factors contribute to approximately 50% of all infertility cases, and female infertility alone accounts for approximately one-third of all infertility cases. Causes of infertility are many and varied and involve male, female or a combination of factors. They include problems with the production of sperm or eggs,the structure or function of male or female reproductive systems and/or hormonal and immune conditions in both men and women.<p>What causes female infertility?<p>If a woman keeps having miscarriages, it is also called infertility. Female infertility can result from physical problems, hormone problems, and lifestyle or environmental factors. The most common causes of female infertility includes the following<p>* Problems with ovulation
* Age can contribute to infertility because as a woman ages, her fertility naturally tends to decrease. 
* Problems with the reproductive tract (e.g., blocked or damaged fallopian tubes, endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, benign uterine fibroids, and complications
  from surgery or infection).
* Sexually transmitted diseases 
* Smoking, drinking alcohol, or using recreational drugs (e.g., cocaine and marijuana).
* Medications such as antidepressants,tranquilizers, calcium channel blockers,narcotics, and anti-cancer drugs.
* Exposure to radiation, lead, toxic fumes and pesticides.
* Incorrect timing of intercourse relative to ovulation.
* Medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, liver disease, sickle cell disease, and chronic infections including HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B or C,and        tuberculosis.
* Overweight or underweight<p>Diagnosis of female infertility.<p>Doctors usually begin with a medical history about your menstrual cycle, past illnesses, sexually transmitted diseases and surgeries, and if you are taking drugs or have been exposed to toxic agents. The medical history is usually followed by a pelvic exam to make sure your reproductive tract (vagina, uterus, and ovaries) is normal, and blood tests to measure your hormone levels. A semen analysis and a medical history of your partner will also be performed. Depending on what is found in these tests, your doctor may also perform more specialized tests like Laproscopy,Hysteroscopy,Sonohystogram and ultrasound,of your reproductive tract, including one to make sure your fallopian tubes are not blocked. Tracking your ovulation through fertility awareness will also help your healthcare provider assess your fertility status.<p>Treatment options For Female Infertility<p>Treatment of infertility depends on the cause and the womans age. It falls into two main categories: one helps fertility through medications or surgery, and the other uses assisted reproductive technologies. Fertility drugs are the main treatment for women with ovulation disorders, and may also be used in women with no identifiable cause of their infertility. These treatments may also be used with an intrauterine sperm injection (IUI), when sperm is injected directly into the uterus around the time of ovulation. Surgery may benefit women with fibroids, uterine polyps, or endometriosis. Surgery may also be an option when the cause of infertility is blocked fallopian tubes. It is important to note that attempts to unblock a fallopian tube may increase the risk of ectopic (tubal) pregnancy. Other options for a couple to achieve pregnancy include assisted reproductive technology such as mixing sperm with an egg outside the body (known as in vitro fertilization or IVF) or injecting a single sperm into an egg (known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection or ICSI), then transferring the resulting embryo back into the uterus. For women with very few remaining eggs in the ovaries,egg and embryo donation are options. Surrogacy is also one of the option for infertile couples.<p>Can female infertility be prevented?<p>If the female infertility is caused by genetic problems or illness then nothing can be done to prevent it. However, if women takes following steps ,she can decrease the possibility of infertility:<p><pre><code>    Take steps to prevent sexually transmitted diseases
    Avoid illicit drugs
    Avoid heavy or frequent alcohol use
    Adopt good personal hygiene and health practices
    Have annual check ups with her gynaecologist or infertility specialist
</code></pre>
Emotional support During Infertility Treatment and Evaluation.<p>The inability to become pregnant can lead to a variety of emotions, including anxiety, depression, anger, shame, and guilt. In one study, 40 percent of infertility patients suffered with some type of psychiatric disorder; the most common diagnosis was an anxiety disorder (23 percent), followed by major depressive disorder (17 percent). Both men and women can suffer from these problems, which can further hinder a couple's ability to become pregnant. 
The best approach for treatment of psychological distress related to infertility treatment has not been determined. However, some experts suggest relaxation techniques, stress management, coping skills training, and group support. Evaluation by a psychiatrist may be needed for some persons with significant symptoms of anxiety or depression.<p>When should someone contact an Infertility Specialist?<p>If a female is facing problems like abnormal bleeding, abdominal pain, fever, unusual discharge, pain or discomfort during intercourse and soreness or itching in the vaginal area then the female should contact the doctor or her infertility specialist at the earliest.<p>Confronting an infertility diagnosis can be difficult but it is an important milestone. It marks progress on your path to resolving your infertility.

The Creative Suite software is all pretty good year over year and generally improves more than regresses, and this is true up to and including CS6,  IMO.

I'm much less efficient at, say, copying out prose that's already written (unless my prediction engine is familiar with it...).<p>My software is like an on-screen keyboard with context-sensitive prediction, more sensible orientation and layout, and lots of shortcuts overloaded on the buttons, operated by the other mouse buttons and the scroll-wheel.  So, for example, moving a word/page at a time, selecting lines/files, unindenting, etc. are just done by scrolling in the right place, control-A is middle-clicking A, and so on (the program just sends the appropriate keystrokes to make things happen).  Selecting and toolbars/menus are fast because you're already using the mouse, and copy and paste is just select and middle click on Linux.<p>RSI basically forced me to develop the system (I can't use a physical keyboard, and no existing software was or is good enough), and I have been using it for all my typing since 2003.

4032138,comment,4031699,4031983,1,0,drawkbox,,,"Yes I was just talking in a general sense that JSON should not go all XML and mutate.  In some cases I have added layers like this for instance in a C++ parser for game engines it allowed comments in the json but were stripped out at runtime on load and on send/receive from the services.  But conforming to JSON that current browsers, libraries etc can use.<p>I see where you were going with it, ES5 support as a baseline is nice, also comments are nice but also bulky to a streamlined messaging format in most cases (config is usually yaml or some other format for this reason maybe).<p>I guess the naming is what maybe might cause some confusion and a good engineer makes things more simple not more complex, the simplicity of JSON is hard to achieve with such success but it is also its killer feature so that should be recognized.  As long as we don't have to support 50 different 'modern JSON' formats then we are good. There are some good ones like BSON for binary JSON. I guess JSON5 works for your ES5 support.<p>I think here you have good reasons for your work but it goes back to the age old be 'conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept'.  That standards agreement makes everything work and to me being an engineer is taking complexity and simplifying always, bloat is bad. Here it isn't that but XML started out simple as well and became a verbose, bloated hell so people get touchy with JSON hehe.",1338184255

Likewise, it currently is only used as a stop-gap measure to begrudgingly support older browsers.<p>If we're going to undo years of progress we should do it for a <i>very</i> good reason.<p>JSON has wide support in many languages. Some of them have fast low level parsers. All that work has to be duplicated.

Again, there's just not enough benefits.<p>I consider comments a flaw, because they add little benefit. JSON is a data serialization/interchange format and there shouldn't be much need to comment on it, it should be largely self explanatory. If you really need to tag things with info, you can in JSON. Adding comments is to tempting for people to abuse.<p>However, if you really need lots of comments, there are many existing formats which might be better suited for your task. JSON is ultimately for machines. It has a benefit that humans can read/edit it easily...but if you have data that is intended more for humans and needs lots of meta information like a complicated config file, you should either create a front end for it or use a format better suited to that purpose.<p>When you consider that writing a plugin for your editor, or just a stand-alone translator would solve all of the problems this does, there's no reason to put up with all the drawbacks.<p>What it comes down to IMHO, is this isn't suitable to replace JSON and for other uses there are already existing formats that are better.",1338182870

I even tested out GNOME shell in early alphas and <i>liked</i> the new interface.[1] Of course, there were plenty of annoyances, but I was giving the GNOME 3 team the benefit of the doubt because it was very early software.<p>A few months ago, I switched to LXDE. I am much happier in an environment that is closer to the traditional GNOME 2 experience than GNOME 3 is.[2] LXDE is not user friendly like GNOME and so it requires some basic customization (with text files) to get it working comfortably. On the other hand, GNOME 3 is user hostile when you want to do <i>any</i> customization at all!<p>GNOME 3 is nice when you use it <i>exactly</i> as the developers intend, but they purposefully make it hard to customize:<p>Do you want to set custom GTK themes on a per-application basis like you could in GNOME 2? Too bad -- that feature doesn't exist in GTK3 and the GTK2 command line magic that used to work no longer works in GNOME 3. I mean, it's not like some applications simply look horrible in the default theme while others pretty much require the default, right?[3]<p>Do you hate wasted space on your screen? Well, the padding is there to stay so you have to set the title bar font to a tiny size with a third-party semi-official customization application if you want to make the title bar a sane small size without touching source code. Big GUI elements are touch friendly, yes, but I am not using touchscreens and I don't want wasted space when I could devote more pixels to the actual content I want to focus on.[4]<p>Do you have two large desktop monitors? Too bad, the GNOME 3 experience isn't optimized for multi-monitor setups. They put more thought into touchscreen devices (where currently no one uses GNOME 3) rather than fairly common multi-monitor setups.[5]<p>There's a complete lack of meaningful customization in GNOME 3 and the tiny bit of customization that exists is via the GNOME Tweak Tool rather than integrated officially into the desktop environment's settings. This 'do not customize' attitude is a design preference and it's <i>really</i> annoying, especially when no software works flawlessly for all use cases. It seems like they really want to move all customization to random third party add-ons downloaded from the Internet via their website.<p>Don't get your hopes up for GNOME 3. A lot of the missing features are conscious design decisions that might never be fixed. For me, there's no one reason why I can't use GNOME 3, but there's just lots of constant minor annoyances I simply don't experience in other desktop environments. Most of these annoyances will take years to fix and many will never be fixed.[6] Again, none of these are irredeemable flaws, there are just <i>many</i> little faults and the anti-customization attitude of GNOME 3 makes those flaws considerably harder to deal with than they should be.<p>I wouldn't give up on Fedora, but I have definitely given up on GNOME 3.[7] Again, most of GNOME 3's barriers to customization (i.e. fixing their many annoyances) are <i>deliberate</i> decisions that will probably never change. GNOME demands you follow their One True Way of doing things. If I wanted to conform my workflow to some organization's opinions, I probably wouldn't be using Linux in the first place.<p>-----<p>[1] I was pleasantly surprised that the fancy version works even on my laptop, which has terrible Intel integrated graphics from years ago. My laptop barely handles anything that requires a graphics card, but it runs GNOME 3's new shell.<p>[2] LXDE doesn't have some features that GNOME 2 had, but LXDE also has some cool things that GNOME 2 didn't have. One cool feature I particularly like is being able to remove window border decorators. It's the little things that count. LXDE+Openbox have as many little details that I like as GNOME 3 has little details that annoy me.<p>[3] This was actually the last straw that sent me to LXDE. I spent days trying to either set an appropriate theme or figure out how to set themes for each application. The GTK3 theme for GNOME 3 simply doesn't work for all types of applications even though you can only use one for all of your currently running applications. Of course, the default themes for just about every other desktop environment seem to work fine for all popular applications first-party and third-party, so I really don't know why GNOME 3 has a complete lack of aesthetic taste. Maybe it's some subtle issue like the title bar background color in the window decorator matching the toolbar and menu bar background color.<p>[4] They also want you to constantly switch to a separate mode (the Activities view) to do many common tasks, like quick launching of applications that could easily be located as an icon on the top panel instead.<p>[5] I could get into more detail about all the minor annoyances here, but it would make this rant far too lengthy.<p>[6] It seems like they love the large icons and the massively huge window decorator title bar padding. Expect a user interface that works universally, even on device form factors you will never use GNOME on, to be a higher priority than one that works well on large desktop screens.<p>[7] I don't hate GNOME 3. I wouldn't have put this much effort into criticizing it (based on over a year of trying to like it) if I immediately hated GNOME 3. It's just that the GNOME team has a different target audience than me (or, really, hackers in general[8]) and it is more work customizing GNOME 3 to work the way I want it to than it is to customize LXDE. LXDE isn't perfect and it isn't polished, but I do expect desktops like LXDE and XFCE to get improvements and attention now that GNOME 3 has alienated most of GNOME 2's audience.<p>[8] The funny thing is that GNOME shell's target audience appears to be people who don't use desktop Linux and who probably will never use desktop Linux. They clearly aren't targeting Linux 'power users' with their design decisions. The issues that prevent desktop Linux from being used are market barriers (i.e. almost every laptop coming with Windows pre-installed (supply) and people being used to Windows after almost two decades of use (demand)) rather than technological or UI barriers.

I also frequently wish I could document the data with comments.<p>I whole-heartedly agree with you on the tediousness, but JSON has this dubious double-nature that it is sometimes written by hand but mostly used as a protocol. As a protocol we want (and I would even argue need) this strictness since it makes day-to-day operations easier and parsers generally more reliable (how many times have we seen someone implement their own JSON parser? Now, what about XML? The first is a nice evening the latter is, well, not...).<p>As for package.json, I would argue the problem is their choice of serialisation rather than with JSON itself.

In that time, I've gone from emacs to Visual Studio to multiple java IDEs and finally landed back on emacs.<p>Emacs is not perfect (far from it!). There are many places where some graphics would go a long way towards improving the UI. Re-implementing emacs would be a bad idea, but learning what works (eg everything is a buffer, everything is easily [for a prorammer] extensible) will go a long way towards making an improved replacement.<p>My rant on menus is not about ""it should be in the shell"". I'm fine with the context being different. I just want my <i>interactions</i> to be the same. If I am searching for some code or searching for some editor command, the context is different but the <i>interaction</i> is the same. Every other piece of software makes the interaction different.<p>I point at emacs, but vi is another good example (just with a different implementation). And I don't want to disparage what the VisualAge folks did (I never saw the smalltalk stuff, but even the much-less-mature java stuff was amazing). But it didn't stick.  Why is that? Once they answer that (I've given my opinion, but I could very easily be wrong), they'll be able to change the software development.<p>The kickstarter made it sound like Light Table would revolutionize programming. I'm all for that, but what I've seen so far doesn't do this. Instead, it makes a really cool tool. There is nothing wrong with that (I use a lot of them), and if that's the case, I'll shut up. :)<p>I'm passionate about this because, in the end, emacs, vi, and every IDE I've used are far from ideal.

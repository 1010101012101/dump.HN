I'm not sure what the averages are. But we already know the comparison is hard because applications to university cost money. Maybe the ratio of applicants-to-slot and cost of application are just parameters of the same model, not proof that there are two different models. But you raise an interesting question:<p>Does a higher ratio necessarily imply more competitive? It could be that more unqualified applicants apply to more jobs than unqualified students apply to university. That would suggest that organization reduces the friction for matching the right employee to the right employer; but differences in ratio due to organization doesn't prove that the right employee is <i>more likely</i> to be matched to the right employer.<p>Why does this matter? If we take efficiency to mean reducing friction, then business will <i>never</i> inform applicants they were rejected. If we take efficiency to mean better candidates get better jobs more frequently, business will <i>always</i> inform applicants they were rejected.",1352659941

It's very hard for for me to believe that a hiring manager has to eyeball a resume for more than a minute to see if the candidate goes in the ""maybe"" pile or the ""no"" pile, and no more than 5 minutes to take a good look at each resume in the ""maybe"" pile</i><p>I've been on the hiring side and have spent time with hundreds of resumes and it can take <i>days</i>. Especially in times of economic woe where you tend to get a lot more qualified applicants.<p>Even with strong well defined hiring characteristics anything past the first couple of passes takes time - or is arbitrary/probability driven.<p>Let's take your strategy with 250 applicants (and I've <i>way</i> larger numbers on occasion);<p>* 250 - 1m per resume into yes/no. Let's be generous and say that cuts out 150. At your one minute per-resume that's over 4.1 hours gone already. (I can tell you that 1m is a hopelessly optimistic number. 1m for the people who totally suck. 2-5mins minimum to deal with the amazing number of really quite talented people who completely suck at communicating those skills in a resume.)<p>* 100 left - at 5m per resume. That's another 8.3 hours gone (and again 5m is way optimistic for a vaguely deep look). Let's say that cuts it down to 25.<p>* 25 - deep look. That's time spent googling, poking at their track history. Discussing pros and cons with team. That's at least 10m per resume. Another 4.1 hours minimum.<p>... so thats <i>more than sixteen hours doing nothing but reading and reviewing resumes</i>. Which translates, once you take doing actual work around that, screen breaks, lunch, etc. into probably nearly three days of actual time. For time estimates which are, in my experience, optimistic...<p>Not that this is an excuse for not getting in touch after a 'no'. If you're getting hundreds of applications you set up a process that can deal with hundreds of applications - but the selection process itself can and does take time and effort.

In fact, the criticisms of confidence intervals and p-values apply almost exactly, in transpose, to credibility intervals and posterior probabilities.<p>Confidence intervals and p-values are a worst-case technique. The p-value will always control the false positive rate below alpha, even in the worst input. Sometimes you do want this -- e.g. when we say that the worst-case runtime of QuickSort is O(n^2), that's useful,
even if we do have a prior distribution over the inputs and could also say that the expected runtime is O(n log n). But the errors are correlated across observations. You can have a valid ""95%"" confidence interval that always produces total nonsense when the experiment ends up with output x, as long as x happens <5% of the time for all possible inputs.<p>Credibility intervals and posterior probabilities are an average-case technique, where we integrate over the prior. Even if the prior is correct, the errors are correlated across inputs, which can be a problem. In the cookie-jar example at stackexchange, the 70% credibility interval is ""wrong"" 80% of the time when the jar is type B. That means if you send out 100 ""Bayesian"" robots to assess what type of jar you have, each robot sampling one cookie, you will expect 80 of the robots to get the wrong answer, each having >73% posterior probability in that wrong conclusion! That's a problem, especially if you want most of the robots to agree on the right answer. The two methods just make different tradeoffs in the way they quantify uncertainty.<p>My quibble with the cartoon, though, was that it's not really about the frequentist vs. Bayesian debate. If you want to decide whether to take action (like shuttering a satellite) in response to a ""YES"" output from the instrument, everybody will agree that you need to calculate {rate of events} * {false negative rate} * {cost of false
negative} and compare it with {1 - rate of events} * {false positive rate} * {cost of false positive}.<p>The frequentist agrees with this math, the Bayesian agrees with this math, and the math doesn't even use Bayes' rule. This is basic actuarial science or decision theory.<p>The frequentist might do the mechanics in a certain way. They may say they are first going to calculate a p-value, and then ask whether the p-value is less than a threshold alpha, where alpha was set based on the costs and rate of events in order to control the ""false discovery rate."" And then take action only on a ""significant"" result.<p>The Bayesian might do the calculation a little differently too; they could say they are first going to use the expected rate of events as a prior, then calculate the conditional probability that there has been an event (given the instrument's reading), and then multiply this posterior probability by the cost of false negative, and its complement by the cost of false positive, to decide which action has lower expected cost.<p>But both the frequentist and Bayesian will get the same answer and end up with the same result as somebody who evaluates the inequality above directly. I don't think any technique has a monopoly on the correct answer here.",1352658015

I know what you mean though.<p>But what I mean is that 25th time you're doing an integral to ram home some trigonometric identity or working out a fourier series for PDEs it's not because anybody hopes that <i>this</i> is the time you get the epiphany it's because the teachers need something for the grade books and you need to be able to do it during a midterm.<p>Assuming Wolfram wasn't engaged in <i>just</i> an attempt to sell more mathematica licenses I would assume that was kind of his point. If you dump the most of the endless repetition on to maxima/maple/mathematica you could actually spend the semester on the concepts and proving them instead of focusing so heavily on the student's facility at algebraic manipulation.<p>Now having had to do everything by hand I have the sort of knee jerk reaction that ""well I had to do it so they should do it too"" but then I also remember that it sucked giant balls. As I see it is students definitely need <i>pretty solid</i> facility at doing this sort of shit and so we get the classic: ""where do we draw the line"" problem, which means I should probably not be counted as a proponent of Wolfram, so much as maybe a sympathizer (in this regard; fuck NKS).<p>*also while I take didn't real, I did get a minor in math which included Basic Concepts of Mathematics, or as I tend to remember it ""that semester of not being able to divide because it's not defined over the integer set"" but it was certainly a purely proof oriented course, and my numerical methods 1&2 were at least 50% proof based, I've done the formal rigor thing.",1352657226

Years ago everyone used Frontpage and Dreamweaver to create their pages, which was fine. But it soon became apparent that handwriting your own HTML gave your far greater control and added way more value, and so use of these visual editors died down. But now they're back for revenge, except from the browser this time, and stuck with a totally overused css framework which in my opinion [when used at stock] completely devalues your design.<p>As a then designer who took the time to learn HTML and CSS during the WYSIWYG cull of the early 00s - which wasn't that hard - I just can't see why these editors are needed.",1352657178

5665038,comment,5664261,5664750,36,0,nlh,,,"So here's the thing - they're not actually that good.  Let me preface this by saying that a) my perspective isn't a normal consumer one -- my business has put tens of thousands of miles on various Aston Martin models (we rent them) and b) the last model I've dealt with extensively is an '06 DB9, so things may have changed a lot in the past few years.<p>But that being said, despite being IMHO the most gorgeous cars on the road, Astons are not particularly well-engineered.<p>First, we had an '02 Vanquish and an '03 Vanquish, both of which had a very fundamental and deeply expensive flaw in the transmission design.  Without getting too deep into it, they used a ""auto manual"" style transmission, which was basically a    6-speed manual combined with hydrolic actuators to shift automatically.  No manual clutchwork required (same design, basically, as BMWs SMG).  On just about all similar cars, after a while (i.e. 12k - 15k miles) the clutch needs to be replaced.  On Ferraris and Lamborghinis, it's a simple job that costs a few $thousand - drop the transmission, replace clutch and flywheel, and you're good.  On both the Vanquishes, the way in which the clutch would fail would literally destroy the entire transmission, and we TWICE had to spend $15,000 to rebuild the entire transmission after a failed clutch (one on each car).  I've never seen another car with design like that, and since it happened the exact same way on two different cars, we're pretty sure it's endemic to the design.<p>Move to the later models - we had a bunch of 05 & 06 DB9s, and they just weren't great.  The brakes were notoriously bad, the bodyflex was particularly bad on the convertibles, and they suffered repeated electrical gremlins.<p>So from my purely technical perspective as a heavy user of Astons, I'd say I'm not impressed with their engineering.<p>NOW - that all being said, I'm not going to make any judgment about this guy and his work at Tesla and what this means about that.  There is far too much that goes into the production of a car to make any real judgment call about things to come --  Astons could have been beautifully engineered and then ruined with bad supplier decisions, that were outside this guy's control.  Etc. etc.<p>So them's my $0.02.",1367877430

I have no particular attachment to Fireworks for example, but Adobe streamlining their product offering and making it into a subscription suite only subsidises things like Adobe Bridge which simply shouldn't exist, at the expense of apps and features which customers actually want. It's around $80 a month in the UK for Adobe CC, and of course they will increase this gradually over time as more customers are locked in.<p>Given the CS updates of the last few years, I have trouble finding reasons to upgrade from CS5, which works fine for me currently, and have no interest in paying them money every month to change the UI around arbitrarily and add more misfeatures like 'Save for Microsoft Office' in CS Illustrator, or reinforce the lack of working interchange between InDesign CS versions (in order to force upgrades). As a long-term customer it feels like Adobe updates are now more focussed on forcing participation in the upgrade treadmill than adding features or improving performance, and this move to subscription pricing with a 'creative cloud' just reinforces this trend - Adobe is now all about customer lock-in and forcing customers to pay in-perpetuity, rather than producing great products. The last great product they produced was Lightroom, and I've seen nothing impressive in the CS since that (for my use). One telling result of this move is that they have now withdrawn the 'perpetual license' that they started selling last year - that lasted 1 year it seems.<p>Perhaps this is inevitable in the mature stage of a corporation, but I'm sad to see what was once a scrappy underdog fighting the likes of quark become focussed on keeping wall street rather than their customers happy.",1367877236

For instance, they went through 4 CEO's over a short period of time and they chose to do a full rewrite from Java to PHP instead of trying to scale the service and because, the rewrite wasn't implemented properly it had to be rewrote again a couple of years later. Moreover instead of sharding/portioning, Friendster chose to scale their service by purchasing an SAN and using daisy-chained MySQL which resulted in considerable slave lag. For comparison, Facebook on the other hand used colleges to ""portion"" their database in the early stages of the company.<p>Instead of doing the rewrite, Friendster should have focused on trying to scale the service like Twitter did by bringing in PivotalLabs - if Friendster sharded their database for instance it would have helped them immensely and may have resulted in a different outcome for the company.",1367877088

Why bother specifying idempotency if it doesn't apply to the communications?<p>The client gets no benefit at all if the server doesn't faithfully serve idempotent responses, and in fact a great deal of the benefit of idempotency is lost.  Specifically, the client cannot reasonably resume a dropped connection if the server changes its responses during a retry scenario (which RFC2616 says the client should do).

A visual update along the lines of OSX's evolving window styles might be part of it, and perhaps the first step, but I would guess that by iOS8 we'll see big new ideas that make the OS even more intuitive.<p>iOS has developed a lot of cruft as new features and preferences were grafted onto the original release. Settings are a hierarchical mess and many of the default apps have inconsistent mental models that need to be reevaluated.<p>By advancing the touch-based UI, iOS brought a more analog (or hardware-like) type of interaction to software. I don't think that fact has been explored deeply enough, and I expect Jony Ive will bring those insights to the revamp.<p>Although iOS also has advances to make in inter-app communication and other areas, I expect Ive to be particularly interested in challenging the high-level HCI problems that are appearing as mobile OSs become more complex.

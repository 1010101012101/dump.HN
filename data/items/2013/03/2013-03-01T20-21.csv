As they get more and more of their needs met by the market they are competing with people thousands of times richer than they are. Simply increasing their incomes is not necessarily an answer, although it is part of the puzzle.<p>The real key is how can they turn what they have (land, sunlight, sometimes water) into what they need (everything else) _without_ having to go to buy things when they need essential needs met. It's not as simple as self-reliance, but admitting that the poor <i>are poor</i> and making them a little richer is not going to stop them being poor.<p>So most of the problems of the poor are basic infrastructure - contaminated water supply and cooking over open fires are huge issues. Both of those are tech-fix issues: cheap, reliable water filters and efficient cook stoves exist. They're coming down in price and improving. Toilets are another huge win, although the technology is less ready.<p>One Acre Fund has a programme which doubles farm yields; they've done tens of thousands of farms in Africa already with excellent results and are scaling fast.<p>If you're interested in software, three areas: medical expert systems, farming expert systems, and basic education services from primary level up.<p>If we could just get that set done, we'd have roughly doubled their standard of living without having put them into direct economic competition with the rich for more of their basic needs. This is not a common perspective, but it actually makes sense.

The recent post about ""Programming Languages Are Simply Not Powerful Enough"" got me thinking about what will be the next major change in programming language paradigms.<p>It seems JS is getting really big lately, since everything is going to the web. But there must be something next that is just a leap different than everything going on right now.<p>Everything moves to be of higher abstraction to where it's more natural for humans to think and perhaps eventually it will be like writing an essay to get what you want [1].<p>But what will be after the current languages we see now? With more things relying on computers and people hoping more will get into computers, are there languages that could be made to encourage that?<p>I have a bunch of random thoughts but I am curious to hear what people that have been involved with computers longer than me think (and ones newer to computers think as well). My little time with prolog made me wish there were more declarative languages.<p>Any thoughts would be great! I am also kind of looking to see if anyone knows of any open source current programming languages that are trying to 'disrupt' the current way of doing things.<p>Thanks.<p>[1] http://blog.wolfram.com/2010/11/16/programming-with-natural-language-is-actually-going-to-work/",1362169843

There's both risk that the customer presenting the card number isn't the cardholder, and risk that the merchant is itself a fraudster trying to charge stolen cards, launder money, or accomplish some other illegal act on the network.<p>Traditional merchant accounts mitigate some of that risk through an extensive underwriting process. Stripe does not have such a process. The only way they can mitigate the risk is by identifying patterns in transaction activity and getting chargebacks/disputes from cardholders. The 7 day period gives them sufficient time to identify the patterns and receive early disputes before the money leaves their control.",1362169800

I have used more text editors than I can remember; I've even written a couple of new ones. My experience has been that the editor makes almost no difference. I spend far more time thinking about code than I ever do writing it.<p>Vi has a terrible ancient mess of an interface designed for primitive machines in a bygone age. I believe that part of its popularity comes from a sort of stockholm syndrome effect; people who have spent the time required to master it don't want to feel that they have wasted their effort, so they assign some of the credit for their own innate productivity to the editor.<p>In practice, I have never seen any difference in productivity levels among my teammates based on the text editors they use. All of the professional programmers I know spend far more time thinking about code, discussing code, and reviewing code than they ever do editing code; even if vi were somehow magically able to make people twice as productive at editing code, that would still only be a small single digit percentage of productivity improvement overall. But I have seen nothing which makes me believe that people using vi are more productive even on strictly text-editing-based tasks than people using other text editors.<p>There are occasional situations where a vi user can do some complex macro thing that rapidly does some transformation to a text file, which someone using a simpler text editor might take longer to perform, but if your project is full of code which needs to be transformed in repetitive, brute force ways, you have bigger problems than your choice of editor.",1362169691

The 'pure render view' which was most commonly espoused early in the debate had the challenge that going from idea, to something people could use, took 6 months at a minimum and a year typically.<p>Since you were there you no doubt experienced the amazingly slow progress of <table></table> support in HTML as it got pushed out to the #1 source of browsers (AOL) on a very slow timeline. The period between 1993 (can't use tables in your web pages because no one except XMosaic users have them) to early 1995 where ""most"" but certainly not a preponderance of web browsers supported them.<p>Some level of programability between client and server was essential. Had the 'render only' view prevailed you wouldn't have Javascript either. But it didn't prevail.<p>That said, security has always had a sort of anti-thetical relationship with 'features.' Its easy to sell features and its hard to sell security. I had built the basics for a nice capabilities based security model for Java early on (even patented it with the NSA's approval), which created a durable way giving only specific capabilities to an applet in a way that made other capabilities not only not accessible but not even <i>present</i> in the running system.<p>It was a bit more complex than the way class loading had traditionally been envisioned, it really crushed my motivation when another engineer on the Java project deleted it out of the source tree because he couldn't understand it.<p>The point I make is that these things evolve, and the story is never as simple as it looked like once you've gotten to the end of it. Should I have pushed harder on conceptual security even though it was hurting my career? Probably. Would it change where we are today? Hard to say.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.greatcircle.com/firewalls/mhonarc/firewalls.199509/msg00353.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greatcircle.com/firewalls/mhonarc/firewalls.19950...</a>",1362169034

On the other hand, the consequences of this viewpoint on most of the points mentioned wind up being absurd.<p>Taking it one point at a time.<p><i>Writing is hard.</i> 
Twitter is the best workaround - you can't write very much, so writing is suddenly easy for everyone there. Outside of twitter,  long form writing is very easy for some people because of a combination of practice and talent. Aside from cultivating that in what will necessarily be a small segment of the population, there's nothing to be done , at least on the order of the authors want of a 10x improvement. Meanwhile, Football has a huge problem that I am both no good at playing it and can't be bothered to practice it.<p><i>Insights are unexpected...99% of the time, Im in no position to synthesize my thoughts into a post...</i> 
Your own time management is a tangential problem. This statement applies to any time-consuming task which you've deprioritized. Prioritize blogging and this ""problem"" disappears.<p><i>Its easy to start but difficult to finish...  Its embarassing...</i>
It's not embarassing. There are only so many things you can do in a day. Other things were more important. Don't be so hard on yourself.<p><i>Although I primarily write for myself, its discouraging to find few people read, let alone share a post Ive spent hours writing...</i>
Doesn't sound like you're writing for yourself at all here. I'll be content if only one person reads this little response of mine.<p><i>Creating or finding visuals is time-consuming.</i>
Very true. A skill and talent in and of itself. If you're willing to just traffic in ideas, and care less about engaging and attracting large audiences, you can just skip the visuals.<p><i>Writers lack feedback.</i>
Here you go, you're welcome. ;)
And by the way, I'm posting the response here because I don't like using Facebook to comment. If you had a normal commenting system, I would have used it.<p><i>Writers lack a personal connection with readers.</i>
Again, give up on large audiences and this is more than just possible. Personal connections and popular media are mutually exclusive.<p><i>Distribution and discovery sucks.</i>
Yup. Although both Twitter and Facebook work as a decent enough channel, I find.<p><i>The best insights are unsharable. The most valuable information is often proprietary and cannot be publicly shared.</i>
Now this is a little crazy. If you decide to make your best insights proprietary, that's entirely your choice and a problem of your own making. I find that most people pay for convenience, not wisdom, so keeping secret insights is less enriching than you'd expect.",1362168928

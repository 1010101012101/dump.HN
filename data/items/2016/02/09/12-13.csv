For example, this article says that &quot;Some trans activists have howled at this claim — they believe that desistance is a transphobic myth entirely&quot;, linking to <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brynn-tannehill/the-end-of-the-desistance_b_8903690.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brynn-tannehill/the-end-of-the...</a><p>Now let&#x27;s have a look at that article:<p>&quot;For starters, the most cited study (Steensma) which alleges a 84 percent desistance rate, did not actually differentiate between children with consistent, persistent and insistent gender dysphoria, kids who socially transitioned, and kids who just acted more masculine or feminine than their birth sex and culture allowed for. In other words, it treated gender non-conformance the same as gender dysphoria. Worse, the study could not locate 45.3 percent of the children for follow up, and made the assumption that all of them were desisters. Indeed, other studies used to support this also suffered from similar methodological flaws.&quot;<p>Yowch. That&#x27;s some seriously dodgy science there - almost half the subjects lost to follow-up, assigning a particular outcome to the drop-outs, questionable selection criteria... And the NY Mag completely ignores the actual methodological issues, instead dismissing them as ideological complaining from trans activists.<p>This is pretty sleazy too: &quot;they just haven’t come up with scientifically convincing explanations for why the studies would all be wrong, and all in the same way&quot;. The studies in question took a group of people who met some definition of gender variance and looked at how many transitioned. The more strict the definition they used, the higher the proportion that transitioned - and the NY Mag are arguing that the studies showing the highest proportion of non-transitioners are right and indisputable because all the studies showed some positive proportion of non-transitioners, which is the only thing they <i>could</i> show.",1455022574

That war is known for the use of chemical weapon attacks, and guess who made those weapons. I&#x27;ll quote from summary on Amazon for Freemantle&#x27;s book:<p>> Within months of the start of the First World War, Germany began to run out of the raw materials it needed to make explosives. As Germany faced imminent defeat, chemists such as Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch came to the rescue with Nobel Prize winning discoveries that overcame the shortages and enabled the country to continue in the war. Similarly, Britain could not have sustained its war effort for four years had it not been for chemists like Chaim Weizmann who was later to become the first president of the State of Israel. Michael Freemantle tells the stories of these and many other chemists and explains how their work underpinned and shaped what became known as The Chemists&#x27; War.<p>Thus, while coal hydrogenation helped Nazi Germany stay in the war, the Haber-Bosch process made the ammonia needed to produce the explosives that helped Kaiser Germany stay in the war.<p>Certainly chemists were important in WWII (as were mechanical engineers, aviation engineers, metal working, and many other specialties). But the appellation &quot;the physicists’ war&quot; also highlights the relative decrease in the role of chemistry on the actual fighting, compared to WWI.",1455022374

That&#x27;s fair enough since the Romans spent a good amount of time telling each other the same thing.<p>But it&#x27;s a mistake to apply what we think today to how they felt about things. One of the things the Romans lamented was the fact that after the Greek conquest, some Romans were taking to using beds at night! Beds! Every real Roman slept on the ground, where it was natural.<p>Likewise with the &quot;Horrors of the Colosseum&quot;. We think of the animal acts as horrendous -- and they were, to us. To Romans, who knew death on a much more personal level, it was entertaining but not profoundly obscene. (Can you imagine what it would be like to live in a huge city in Roman times without modern medicine? You had to pass dozens in the street every day either dying or almost dead)<p>They were not without standards. In the history of one of the Christian martyrs, Perputua, there&#x27;s a story of women stripped naked and put in a net -- in order for the animals to take them. The crowd was horried, however. Why? Because one of the women had just given birth and was still producing milk. So they demanded she be clothed, she was, and the animals proceeded to destroy them all.*<p>The Romans were a bloodthirsty bunch, for sure. But they did have what they considered to be high moral standards. Those standards just don&#x27;t match up to the ones we have today. (I&#x27;m not trying to make a case for relative morality, simply pointing out that you have to learn and accept the Romans in their own terms. Otherwise you&#x27;ll be making all kinds of assumptions that simply aren&#x27;t true)<p>1. <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/maps/primary/perpetua.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/maps/...</a><p>* Also interesting was that the Romans selected <i>female</i> animals to kill the women.

Some times I use it as a source of tranquility, some times I use it to focus on a certain topic I want to work out in my head, and some times I have absolutely zero intention and I just let the experience happen. Much like meditation, in the time immediately after the tank I find myself more aware, moving a bit slower, just kind of taking the environment in. First time I ever tried the tank was in NYC and I walked from Chelsea to the east side. The sounds of the city seemed much more sharp.<p>I definitely recommend meditating consistently before trying it, if you can.

However your upload is very appreciated because it retains Google&#x27;s superior text layer and the Internet Archive does some preprocessing which ruins the images.<p>Regarding copyright: if the work is legitimately public domain, then no one can restrict your use of it unless their copy is a derivative work. It could just be their standard disclaimer.[0] The site and PDF both explicitly note that the work is in the public domain in the US. It was published before 1923, and the primary author died more than 100 years ago.[1] However I can&#x27;t track down when the translator died but I trust that HathiTrust did their due diligence. A caveat is whether it is public domain outside of the US; I&#x27;m not a lawyer and I don&#x27;t know the copyright laws of other countries so I couldn&#x27;t tell you.[2] That&#x27;s probably why the site also restricts access to US IPs.

That&#x27;s hard to write, and the staff at Wired deserve credit for their effort to be open and direct with us.<p>Unfortunately the post fails to address the reasons that their readers USE ad blockers. If only they had gone a LITTLE bit farther in this post and made specific promises in exchange for being whitelisted. Here are the promises that would have convinced me.<p>- Third party scripts will be kept to under 33% of page weight. (They&#x27;re at ~50% for this article, and that&#x27;s with a 1.1MB gif in the content!)<p>- We will respect &quot;do not track&quot; headers in your browser (or settings on your Wired account) by excluding you from ad- and analytics-related tracking<p>- If you have enabled &quot;do not track&quot; headers in your browser, we will only serve you anonymous ads<p>- We may serve you ads based on your browsing behavior at wired.com, but they will always include a short explanation. For example, &quot;because you were interested in XXXX:&quot;<p>- Our ad placement and content will follow strict limitations (link to a public page of their guidelines), based on the the Adblock &quot;Acceptable Ads&quot; rules (<a href=""https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#criteria"" rel=""nofollow"">https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#criteria</a>).<p>- We will serve all content and ads over HTTPS, from within the wired.com TLD (or include a list of specific sources), so you can trust that it&#x27;s really coming from us.<p>Since Wired doesn&#x27;t offer to address any of the issues that make (technical) people enable an ad blocker, the post is reduced to an ultimatum. They&#x27;re asking you to make a special exception for Wired, and offering only a stick as incentive. No carrot, no quid pro quo, and no addressing your concerns. And they&#x27;re doing it on a 3.3MB page with 1.5MB worth of third party ads and tracking code attached.<p>Giving an ultimatum to 20% of your readership sounds like a stupid business strategy, and I doubt it&#x27;s what the Wired board had in mind. Perhaps they could learn something from app designers: if something is so objectionable about your Ux that 20% of your user base uses third party alternatives to get at your content, try a little market research to improve that Ux. Just do a cursory investigation into WHAT people find so terrible, and WHY they use the alternative; consider how you might change your Ux to make that unnecessary. This is 20% of your userbase who likes your content so much, they find ways to access it despite a shitty OOTB Ux. It would be a big sacrifice to cut off such a dedicated (and large) group of fans.",1455020000

Of course it makes things ultimately worse, but why do people need to go into debt they can&#x27;t get out of, and why do people finance loans to people who can&#x27;t pay them off in the first place?  The central problem lay in that direction.<p>The problem is utilized industrial capacity has been falling for decades.  Companies are not employing the invested capital and machinery they already own at anywhere near full capacity.  So why invest more?<p>Even with capital utilization rates falling for decades, there is still overproduction - or underconsumption, depending on the angle.  Corporations are flush with cash reserves.  Naval Ravikant turned down a $600 million blank check from Chinese investors.  Meanwhile wages have been moribund for a long time.  Inflation-adjusted hourly wages were higher in the U.S. 45 years ago.  Real hourly wages aee lower, yet more capital equipment exists and productivity has risen.  It is trying to sell more to people who have less.<p>The economic report of the president (US) has US industrial capacity utilization rates- over 87% from 1967 to 1969.  By 2011 it was below 77%.

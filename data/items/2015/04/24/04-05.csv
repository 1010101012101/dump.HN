This would be:<p>* unpredictable in practice (theoretically a player could reliably predict the hash, but only if they overpower the entire Bitcoin mining network, at a cost of billions of dollars in mining hardware)<p>* globally verifiable, allowing reliable synchronization<p>The only drawback would be that the time between proof of work shares meeting a particular difficulty target is somewhat random, in being a Poisson distribution that only averages to a particular value.",1429851510

9431465,comment,9429224,9429224,0,0,smaccoun,,,"Beyond the technology that often emerges from scientific endeavors, science alone is a beautiful discipline that engages man in the world from the &quot;objective&quot; perspective. However science has, and always will, sit under the umbrella of philosophy. Science stops at a basic set of assumptions which - although valuable in a limited sense - must keep the curious mind wanting more. More importantly though, science often leaves out those questions that are most important to us - those questions that concern the relation of mySELF, that most mysterious thing, with the rest of the world. Perhaps the best person to elucidate this fact is Erwin Schrodinger, who&#x27;s books My View of the World, Nature and the Greeks, and What is Life are absolute must reads:<p>&quot;I am very astonished that the scientific picture of the real world around me is deficient. It gives a lot of factual information, puts all our experience in a magnificently consistent order, but it is ghastly silent about all and sundry that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It cannot tell us a word about red and blue, bitter and sweet, physical pain and physical delight; it knows nothing of beautiful and ugly, good or bad, God and eternity. Science sometimes pretends to answer questions in these domains, but the answers are very often so silly that we are not inclined to take them seriously.&quot;",1429850432

I thought that both of those things were deterministic to begin with--monsters that get hit by other monsters will go after the offender until it&#x27;s dead or something else hits them, and the player makes the &quot;pained gasp&quot; sound effect every time he&#x27;s hit.",1429848232

The writers and publications you work with will be looking for your help, too. You&#x27;ll need to guide them on how to make their pitch compelling, how to set a budget, and how to spread the word. Ideally, you&#x27;re a savvy writer, marketer and campaigner, as well as a reassuring presence. The job takes a bit of all those traits.<p>What you accomplish will have national impact. We&#x27;ll place your projects in the pages of the country&#x27;s biggest newspapers and magazines, and get hundreds of thousands of people talking about them.<p>Some sample projects:<p>- We have a budget of $100,000 for coverage about climate and the environment. Identify a roster of reporters, photographers and videographers who would create interesting stories, and get them to create crowdfunding pitches using matching funds from our pool.<p>- Readers of a national publication want more news from China and are willing to pay for a full-time reporter. Work with the publication to identify a reporter, craft the crowdfunding pitch and spread the word to even more readers.<p>- A reporter has an idea for a story about the criminal justice system in Northern California, but they don&#x27;t know how to get it funded. Help them create a pitch and a budget, and then find a publication to run the final story.<p>REQUIREMENTS<p>- Experience in a writing, marketing, advertising, PR or content production role for at least two years.<p>- Self-starter, capable of working in an environment without much supervision.<p>- Entrepreneurial. Each project is like your own mini-startup. We know not all of them will succeed, but you have to be able to prioritize and put resources behind the ones that are most promising.<p>- An understanding of how to use data and metrics to inform strategy.<p>NICE TO HAVES<p>- Experience as a journalist isn&#x27;t strictly necessary, but it helps. At minimum, you should have an understanding of how the world of journalism works.<p>- Experience working with a product team. The challenges you will encounter can often be made easier through technology. Being able to communicate and make the case for product changes will make your life easier.<p>- Experience running social advertising campaigns.<p>- Experience as a manager.<p>LOCATION / COMPENSATION<p>We&#x27;re an early-stage, venture-backed startup based in Oakland. You&#x27;ll get a competitive salary, an equity stake and benefits. We have team lunches every week, and keep the office well stocked with snacks.<p>APPLYING<p>Send an outline of your experience to jobs@beaconreader.com as well as a few bullet points about how you think you&#x27;d be most useful. We&#x27;re looking to move quickly, and you should be too.",1429848162

It can actually be different <i>using the same binary</i> and still be compliant.<p>Something like this:<p><pre><code>    if( a == x/y )\n      assert( a == x/y );\n</code></pre>\nIs allowed to assert (!). It&#x27;s also allowed to not assert. Worse, the following is a legal &quot;optimization&quot; of the above code:<p><pre><code>    if( a == x/y )\n      if ( getRandomBooleanFromSomewhere() ) \n        assert( a == x/y );\n</code></pre>\n(I&#x27;d use rand, but I don&#x27;t want to get into matters of state here. Just assume that getRandomBooleanFromSomewhere, well, pulls a random boolean from somewhere. No side effects.)<p>Why, you might ask? It&#x27;s allowed to use extra precision, but not required to. And it&#x27;s not required to even be consistent about it. So: if it uses extra precision, and it decides to lose the extra precision (say, by spilling x/y to stack) between the first and second uses, the assert could potentially fire. If it doesn&#x27;t do both of those, the assert cannot fire. So it&#x27;s legal to remove the assert, but also legal to keep it. And also legal to randomly decide which to do at runtime.<p>Now, this is a stupid thing for it to do in this case. But nonetheless, it is allowed. And there are cases where analogous optimizations actually make a plausible amount of sense.<p>You can work around it to an extent with FPU flags. But that way lies madness. To put it mildly.

772508,comment,770072,771635,0,0,gdp,,,"Oh, I just read the comment you're referring to, and I think you've completely misinterpreted the commenter.  The use of ""program text"" is used in a fairly precise way to mean ""the tokens unconsumed up to this point in the execution"", which appears to be what you asserted in your reply.  Of course, given that the parse tree is just a structured representation of the program text, with no pre-determined traversal order, is it not true that the parser needs the context resulting from having evaluated part of the tree in order to decide how to proceed in evaluating the rest of it?<p>I think you've taken a technically accurate comment and then answered a completely different point.",1250683106

Just like any other call.  (It is not VoIP until your voice gets to Google's servers.  Then it travels over IP, until it is converted to POTS at the other end.)<p>The only loss for AT&T is that SMS messages use your data plan, and that you can call people (and receive calls from them) from a phone other than your cell phone.<p>Personally, I think killing this off was really stupid.  It caused them lots of regulatory scrutiny for something that only a few users use.  (GV is still invite-only, after all.)",1250680621

They are making slow but steady progress, which is all that you can really ask for with such ambitious goals, and all that it takes to achieve them, if you have a little patience.<p>When I first got my OpenID, this site was the only use I could find for it. Then I could use it on Stackoverflow. Then I could use it to comment on half the blogs in the world with Disqus. And now I can use it with Facebook (somehow.. I haven't got that working yet). This is a remarkable amount of progress for about one year.<p>The big players are not as averse to this as you make them out to be. Google in particular seems to be open to the idea of open data. They are also making Wave which I could see having a huge democratizing effect on the internet.<p>I started developing for the web a decade ago and back then, the only way to ""share"" data from another site was to scrape it, and that was considered hostile. Now everyone has feeds and APIs and the open standards are clearly catching on. I've seen enough to convince me that this trend will continue until the technorati are satisfied. It may take another ten years but that'll do.",1250680555

772463,comment,771587,772086,0,0,yardie,,,"I sort of agree, except schools are hosting job fairs and finding out no one is coming. Laying people off is hard emotionally. Except for corporate raiders, most companies don't like to do it. It depresses morale. Now imagine you've gone through 2-3,000 workers. But you're still shopping around for interns. The people that stay will see this, and you can guarantee there will be a great deal of sabotage.<p>I remember when there was the contraction (dotbomb) in 1999-2000. I was in Uni and when I went to the job fairs (Engineering, Science, and business colleges all had their own) the amount of alumnus was overwhelming. Guys that had graduated many years before me were taking a 2-3 hour drive to this land-grant university hoping to get a shot. Using their alumni connections to get any job. You can imagine what it would be like for an undergrad, no experience, no references, a meager resume, and a start date months or years away. I remember when Intel gave new hires severance money $7-10,000. They weren't going to start for at least 6 months. But Intel just laid off ~4,000 people so no way these guys were getting in.<p>The problem is those programs are also tied to the economy in general. When businesses aren't hiring paid positions, it is also unlikely they are looking for unpaid interns. And those university programs are meaningless if there are no where for them to go.",1250680406

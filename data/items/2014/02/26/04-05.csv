Second their focus was often more on enabling locals than on trying to do stuff themselves. For example, they would work with locals on how to push through applications for grant money from developed countries. Dealing with American foreign aid bureaucracy was actually a skill they were well suited for due to their background and education. Finally, they lived on almost no money in the community for a long period of time. The standard of their living was commensurate with the average person in the host community.",1393390789

7302994,comment,7295094,7302246,1,0,shawn-furyan,,,"Hah! I just finished Stranger in a Strange Land this weekend :)<p>It was my introduction to Heinlein. I&#x27;d avoided older scifi because I&#x27;d wondered whether I would relate to it, and felt confirmed in that suspicion with Stranger. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m not glad that I read it, and if I consider the context that it was written in circa the 1950s, then I can definitely appreciate how radical it must have been. But to my sensibilities, it feels tawdry and cheap, and thus insincere. It&#x27;s in no way a fair criticism since it seems to have been part of the zeitgeist that led to the free love of the 60s and subsequent over-indulgence and exploitation of the 70s (and thus the dominance of the idea that sex sells and so on). And from what I gather it was rather sincere in so far as Heinlein was supremely interested in challenging prevailing mores of the time. But outside of that context, to me, it feels, again, cheap and tawdry, and just kind of stale.",1393390743

That&#x27;s why statistically the proposed solution isn&#x27;t a solution. It doesn&#x27;t really work in a way that address the serious issue because the serious issue is the sheer magnitude of the number of compromised systems.<p>To put it another way, if you have a Linux or Windows or BSD box why keep a potentially deeply compromised OSX installation around at all. The patch isn&#x27;t going to unpwn a pwnd box. The hoops might insure the patch isn&#x27;t compromised but in terms of system security the horse is out of the barn and all the way to the glue factory.<p>The only case where jumping through those hoops makes a difference is in the second best case. And that&#x27;s statistically equivalent to the best case and preparing for the best case in regard to security goes by the name of &quot;wishful thinking.&quot;",1393390720

7302977,comment,7298646,7299034,7,0,ggchappell,,,"> This article gives a nice glimpse into the essence of why modern strong static type systems like Haskell&#x27;s are such a huge win for development. The type system gives you a way to bound the number of things that you must understand about an API in order to use it. The confidence that we get from having these guarantees makes code reuse orders of magnitude easier in Haskell than it is in pretty much any other language in mainstream use today.<p>Nicely put. I think that&#x27;s the clearest statement I&#x27;ve ever seen about why a powerful, expressive type system is a Good Thing.<p>Now, tell me how to get this point across to a programming-languages class for junior/senior C.S. majors, in at most a couple of days, starting 18 hours from now. ;-)",1393390561

Wolfram invites comparisons to people like Leibniz for his own ends. I think it is less to stoke his vanity than to set high standards for himself. Choosing Newton as a role model may be vain but it also places massive responsibility upon him. Newton sought to solve important problems not disrupt pet grooming social networks.<p>He has extended Mathematica and added a search engine and is shipping it with the most affordable computer hardware he can find. Wolfram Language is an attempt to make maximum human knowledge available and Wolfram has chosen to distribute it inside a project to provide universal access to computing hardware.<p>Will it all work out? There are no guarantees. Millenia are long and media fragile.

I would find an already successful enterprise software sales person in the space you want to be in. He/She probably already has a job but sales people sell and they love have new things to sell. It may take some convincing but keep persistent and you will find someone.<p>The salesperson does not really rack up the dollar amount on a feature by feature basis. There is not some line item set of features each with a price. They are buying the whole thing - the feature dance is all about ensuring the customer (whether you have the goods or not) that your package will fit their needs. Large corporations have evolved themselves into a potpurri of rules and processes for how they do things. They dont make sense in most cases which is what prevents them from using a low barrier to entry tool like something a small startup might make - basically, they cannot change their process to fit the software, they need the software to fit them. None will, I repeat, no software from any vendor will fit their business...the salesperson has to convince them that you are the best company to make it fit.<p>Preferably dont hire guys and manage, hire no one and do it yourself. When you are working way too much, have not enough time and a mountain of work ahead AND signed deals with customers (including checks) then hire someone. Repeat this process. DO NOT HIRE people until you absolutely need them.<p>If the sales person is any good, he had the next lead before he left the last meeting. When you find a good one you will have to tell them to slow down.<p>Pricing is a black art, too low and no one takes you serious, too high and you become a budget item that needs to be planned for and the sales cycle goes on for over a year which gives competitors more chances. Feel out your customer, ask them directly what their budget is...but mostly let your sales person worry about that.",1393388841

If you skip back two sentences, or enough sentences to match some word or syllable threshold, it may be useful. In that case, you can play a few words, pause for a second or so to let the user decide if they&#x27;ve found the right spot (and context switch into reading) or if they should continue going back. I tried hacking in a quick back button that went back X words, but it was very disorienting. But in any case, it isn&#x27;t as interaction free as doing so when reading a block of text is.

The Microsoft version used to be called JScript. The Adobe version is called ActionScript (ActionScript eventually turned out to be its own sorta language that vaguely conforms to ES standards).<p>Because ECMAScript is just a specification, it is up to the implementors to conform or not to the spec. Mozilla itself does a lot of weird stuff that doesn&#x27;t actually conform to the spec. But for the main uses, all three major engines(V8, Spidermonkey and Chakra) are all pretty okay.<p>If you learn JS for use in node.js, then you are mainly learning the quirks of V8&#x27;s implementation (of which thankfully are minimal). You may think that V8/Chrome is the dominant JS engine out there, but there are some softwares like CouchDB which uses SpiderMonkey as its engine.<p>In the past, I believe there used to be a mini language out of Java, also called Java Script, but that quickly fell out of use.<p>JavaScript as a language was designed to look similar to Java, to catch on the Java-is-the-best-thing-since-sliced-bread bandwagon in the early 1990s.

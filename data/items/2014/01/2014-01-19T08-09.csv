Europeans watch American TV, listen to American music, read American blogs, etc. But does that also work the other way around? No. This already fails at the language level, as most Europeans speak English, but not many Americans speak another European language. I would even go as far as saying that most European journalists read more US sources than they read sources from their neighbour countries. This is also mostly caused by language skills.<p>As a consequence, when trying to gain attention as a European startup, you can either try to conquer the European countries one by one - or you can try to get American attention (e.g. techcrunch) and let the European tech journalists copy from there. This is a though choice US entrepreneuers don&#x27;t have and its caused by the cultural one-way street.",1390121642

Sorry. Looks like they&#x27;re trying to fit their content in one of those Generic Fad Layout Templates you find on ThemeForest. The LOGO is awesome though.<p>● Registering a domain is now harder. Before I could select a dropdown menu and see all the TLD options. Now I can&#x27;t.<p>● Did you know that NameCheap sells .es domains? Guess how many screens you have to click through to find that out.<p>● Did you know NameCheap .coms are only $10 while other sites sell them for $14. Because this design doesn&#x27;t tell you anything.<p>● I have to scroll so much to get so little. White space is good in moderation but this is just overdone. There&#x27;s so little content and so much white space and meaningless grey elements and slideshows and giant icons that it makes the site look sterile.<p>● There&#x27;s a slideshow with only 2 slides, one of them talking about Web Hosting (to sell web hosting plans), the other about Security (to sell ssl certificates). No other data. No other info. How many people do you think are going to click the second slide and find out that NameCheap sells really cheap ssl certificates.<p>● Lots of garbage information is taking up space.<p>● Less functional than the previous design.<p>● Some of the worst copywrite I&#x27;ve seen. &quot;The internet needs people&quot; and &quot;Getting your site online is easier than you think.&quot;<p>● It tries to advertise NameCheap (poorly) and what it does (poorly) rather than letting me do it.

An example: it includes a fs-events system, to monitor for changes in files, but it is crippled to work around a bug in one version of Mac OS X, and so in the end, one probably has to write their own file-monitoring logic for each platform (or copy the Chromium code, and then modify it).

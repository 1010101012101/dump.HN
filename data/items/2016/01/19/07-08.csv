We were there in the summer vacation to boost our flying hours on Bulldogs - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Aviation_Bulldog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Aviation_Bulldog</a>. I had joined the cadets relatively recently and so, as it happened, my first solo occurred during that camp also. Because the Lightnings were using the main runway, we were using a parallel grass strip, and flying mirrored circuit patterns. On my solo trip (really just a flight around the airfield) a Lightning passed next to me on its approach and caught me in its wake, flipping me onto my side. Exciting but no drama - I just went around again.<p>After uni I did sign up as an RAF pilot, but circumstances (and my own fundamental lack of aptitude) conspired against me and I flunked the course (just) before getting my wings.

Living hand to mouth is very humbling and I&#x27;m still easily within the top 50% in terms of global wealth, purely due to having been born in the right place.<p>I never set out to make money anyways (though I would like a little bit more than I have now), but I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable participating in a system I would rather didn&#x27;t exist (i.e. shorting markets, making money by moving money etc). If I was really interested in that I would have attempted it long ago, (in fact I was presented with ample opportunity to do so, by a dodgy potential investor, in a previous business venture) but I prefer to immerse myself in making things.<p>Reading posts such as PG&#x27;s pro-inequality posts I have realised that I have something no rich person could ever have, and that is an insight into how the majority of people in the world think and act, and why this happens. For example I only need one reasonable pay day and my whole consciousness changes, everything I think about, do and occupy myself with, flips. Creativity suddenly explodes and productivity goes through the roof. I&#x27;m not sure people who have never experienced hand to mouth living realise how destructive inequality and poverty really are. It is holding back the true potential of the human race in uncountable ways.",1453190179

Stuff like mutexes, condition variables and even atomics is pretty much standard nowadays (even if you need portability, you can usually rely on stuff like glib or Qt or boost); thread-safe collections are rarely the right solution, because too many fine-grained locks incur excessive overhead.  The work-stealing queue is nice, but if you really want things to scale you need stuff like highly-parallel fast paths, with message passing on the slow paths.

We had it running 24/7 on work laptops and phones so the messaging issue was less obvious. The typical user started Skype on their desktop, and killed it after a video call. They also killed it from running in the background on their phone because it killed the battery. We just keep charging the phone.<p>And as we saw issues come up with Skype for our usage patterns, we did focus on those. Did you know that originally the limit of a group size was 300, a random constraint someone added in, and got hardcoded in all the apps? That size was basically chosen because we were pretty sure the largest company Skype group would not grow beyond it.

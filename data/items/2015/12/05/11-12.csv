There are many things I find abhorrent about the proposed world described in the article, but I will refer to only one of them. Btw, even if I find abhorrent this &quot;new&quot; world order, it&#x27;s much better than the world order imposed by the Yes We Can people.<p>> Additionally, they shall have one or more &quot;hosts&quot; who do not drink alcohol, and who are trained to observe and catch violations should they occur.<p>Yeah, this casual suggestion that some sort of &quot;police&quot; should exist to <i>monitor</i> people&#x27;s behavior and catch policy violations quickly is the worst thing that is currently happening to humanity in my opinion, and ultimately results in a world I don&#x27;t want to be part of.<p>The police part is bad in itself, but much worse is how casual this &quot;final solution&quot; is proposed, and how little people complain about it. People were bred into obedience and submission. We already lost.<p>There&#x27;s very little for me to do about this. All I can do is vote with my money, e.g. I don&#x27;t go to conferences where people are not adults enough that they don&#x27;t know how to <i>live</i>, yes, live life, without CoCs and police, even though I am one of the nice people at those conferences, not one of the &quot;bad actors&quot; the author mentions.

10681625,comment,10657435,10665633,0,0,Nicolas0682,,,"The readability argument is overused and maybe misunderstood to me.<p>An experienced programmer is supposed to know the language well as well as the API and frameworks.<p>From my experience Java is quite verbose and the standard frameworks are among the most complex. It is typical for a clojure/scala/python program to require 1/2 or 1/3 the lines of codes than Java. And they require much less configuration files and annotations.<p>How much time a developper spend to read his operating system code? How much time a developper spend to read the API implementation code of his language or even the framework ? No time because the code is great, work as expected and doesn&#x27;t require to be read all the time.<p>That&#x27;s what a more expressive language provide. At greater set of standard language construct, API and frameworks that allow you to express the same in a much more concise way. This is much easier to read because the fundations are rock solid and the meaning of a function doesn&#x27;t evolve over time, it is also nearly bug free. You reduce the accidental complexity.<p>When you choose a less expressive language like Java, even with the most advenced frameworks you have much more unreliable custom code. You are in fact increasing the readability issue, not reducing it.<p>Sure there the fact that many more developper master Java and the associated frameworks than say Scala or Clojure. But this also act as a filter.<p>You can do the same thing with a team of 5 experienced clojure developpers than with 20-30 java dev. A part come from the language expressivity itself. A part is that it is much more likely to get bad developpers in Java that will mess your code and make you loose time. It is easy to find Java dev, a bit less to find great Java developpers. Another part is that the bigger the team, the more is lost in communication, meetings and politics than actually doing things.<p>So that your choice ! Do you prefer 5 clojure dev, maybe paid 20-30% more or 30 java dev with 5 managers (paid 20-30% more) competiting to get budget and projects ?",1449316067

Fortunately, there are several linting tools, such as jshint, which analyze code and complain about such things; I&#x27;d suggest taking a look at jshint&#x27;s documentation, which is a veritable catalog of things it&#x27;s easy to get wrong in JS and have come back later to bite you. I&#x27;d suggest even more strongly installing jshint and using it on your code; it&#x27;s easy (just &quot;npm install -g jshint&quot; and you&#x27;re off and running) and highly beneficial.<p>I&#x27;d also suggest that it&#x27;s worth your while to take advantage of the JS dev community&#x27;s excellent culture around automated testing; while that&#x27;s a slightly more complicated topic, it is only slightly so, and I&#x27;ve found that a solid test suite, plus a coverage tool to ensure it doesn&#x27;t leave anything out, is even better for improving and maintaining code quality than just a linter by itself -- jshint can catch stylistic and structural errors, but only unit tests will catch logic errors and regressions introduced by a new change. If you&#x27;re (understandably) bewildered by the variety of testing tools available -- it seems like somebody comes out with a nifty new one every week or so -- then I&#x27;d suggest you can hardly go wrong with these:<p>* jshint, as already described<p>* Mocha, a flexible and reliable test framework<p>* Istanbul, a coverage report generator<p>* Grunt, a build tool whose plugin architecture simplifies integrating them<p>For an example of how they work together, you might take a look at <a href=""https://github.com/aaron-em/same-encoder"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aaron-em/same-encoder</a>, where I use them all in support of a library providing functionality which I think is neat and probably no one else cares about. No doubt there are much better examples, but none come to mind quite so readily, and this codebase being as small as it is, it should be able to serve as a decent overview without being so big you&#x27;ll get bogged down in it. In particular, /Gruntfile.js demonstrates how to tie all these disparate tools together for quick invocation with a single command like &#x27;grunt validate&#x27;, which I find makes it a lot more likely I will actually remember to run them; also take a look in /test/unit for an example of how Mocha tests are actually written.",1449315499

10681593,comment,10677465,10677465,0,0,johncolanduoni,,,"> But it’s not that simple. The “cable” lane traffic (let’s call it Lane 1) includes not just traditional pay TV but also a host of data services — which today could be Stream and tomorrow could be telemedicine, business conference services, or anything else. And Lane 1 uses the internet protocol! This means that data packets are routed around independently, both upstream and downstream, and all that efficient internet magic is happening. From the user’s perspective, when he or she interacts with these things it will “feel” just like online, internet services are responding.<p>I think this definitely violates the spirit of net neutrality even in its current form. However, I don&#x27;t see how they can move from streaming services which are sourced much further down the line than any internet traffic to dynamic traffic that needs total contact with the internet proper. From what I can tell, Comcast is arguing this service doesn&#x27;t violate FCC regulations because it essentially works the same as on-demand cable. The media available for streaming is located close to the customer so it can be downloaded once from the internet proper and then streamed on demand without incurring any of the more valuable bandwidth further up the chain. I don&#x27;t even think they need to prioritize the streaming traffic over regular traffic, since it is only eating into the much more plentiful local bandwidth.<p>If this distinction evaporates (as it would for telemedicine, business conference services, etc.), then they&#x27;d clearly violate the letter of FCC&#x27;s net neutrality regulations. The fact that they used IP seems irrelevant; using anything but IP would require huge investment in custom hardware, so I don&#x27;t see that as evidence of a future general internet services Master Plan (past the current streaming media Master Plan coming to fruition). To be honest, I&#x27;m somewhat on the fence about closing this loophole (though more towards the side of closing it) because it really is just like on-demand cable. It&#x27;s clear that the data caps are being used in a predatory way, but I&#x27;m not sure that is the way to attack it.<p>I&#x27;m intrigued by the author&#x27;s proposed solution, but it seems like something of a moonshot.",1449315177

But the management level incl. their new CEO and their UI designers have little clue about their products and what their community is all about. Mr Eich was part of Netscape and Mozilla from the very beginning and created the Javascript language in a few days - he understood the community definitely better.<p>Their new CEO Chris Beard has been with Mozilla for a long time as well, with a break. I also expect it was his decision to pull the plug on sponsored tiles in order to focus 100% on making content discovery awesome for users (maybe with monetization as an afterthought). Saying he has little clue about the community just when he made a decision I imagine the majority of the community supports seems a bit odd. One could argue he should have done this earlier, but don&#x27;t forget that Mozilla needs revenue to survive, and 90+% of the revenue coming from a single partner is a risk that will bite Mozilla sooner or later. So in order to diversify revenue, this was a reasonable experiment.<p>> FirefoxOS runs highend Android smartphone just as fast as Android 5x. So it definitely has a future, like WebOS is nowadays in every LG SmartTV, and Bada/Tizen is in every Samsung SmartTV (they use a 4 or 8 core ARM board with 2+GB RAM).

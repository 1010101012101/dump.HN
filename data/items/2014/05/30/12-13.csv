7821478,comment,7819245,7820524,3,0,berkut,,,"For doing production VFX shots, unless there&#x27;s fur/hair or volumetrics involved, you&#x27;re pretty much IO constrained in terms of pulling in textures and paging them in memory.<p>Often scenes can have > 300GB of textures total. Out-of-core rendering is not something that GPU renderers can do very well yet (redshift can do it a bit), so the 12GB limit on GPU memory is a huge problem. Arnold and PRMan both have deferred shading which means for GI they can re-order texture requests for similar texture mipmap levels to reduce the swapping of textures needed. I&#x27;m not aware of any GPU renderers that can do that as of yet.<p>On top of this, geometry assets are always overbuilt these days, with millions of polys/subds, and often multiple displacement layers on top of this. This geometry requires even more memory.<p>And the biggest studios are rendering deep output, requiring even more memory for the output files as more of the render samples need to be kept in memory for the render duration.<p>And while GPUs are faster, they&#x27;re not THAT much faster for raytracing - a Dual Xeon top end CPU can almost (85% of ) match a K6000 at pure ray/triangle intersection speed.\nWhere GPUs can win is the fact it&#x27;s a lot easier to cram multiple GPUs into a single workstation than get a 4 socket CPU system.<p>But in a renderfarm, this isn&#x27;t an issue.",1401454753

At the time, log4j supported several back versions of the JDK, while JDK logging obviously required you to be on the newest version, v1.4.  As a result, if a library wanted to support any older JDKs, they couldn&#x27;t switch to JDK logging, or had to support two parallel logging frameworks for little gain.  And if your libraries are sticking with log4j, what&#x27;s the advantage to your program of using the JDK logging?<p>slf4j is the current solution for this kind of problem, a common interface to various different logging solutions.",1401454524

That way when I inevitably bork something, I can just forcibly stop it.<p>Another trick I&#x27;ve used is making as much of my core logic as possible happen in functions that are called from the kernel hooks, rather than in the kernel hooks. Then you can test a ton of it in userland to handle basic logic and flow control bugs, finally porting the code to the module. To help with this, it sometimes is actually faster to copy some of the kernel routines you use to a different .c file and change things like kprintf and kmalloc for the userland versions. It isn&#x27;t going to be a perfect port, but it helps get some of the complex stuff out of the way where you have your familiar userland tools.<p>All that said - I&#x27;ve only dabbled in the kernel a little, there are probably better ways that someone can chime in on.",1401454365

The justification for suppressing information is that someone isn&#x27;t in the public interest, the canonical example being a politician that wants to cover up past corruption scandals. Everyone seems to agree that this is a case where data wouldn&#x27;t get filtered.<p>But if someone is thinking about becoming a politician, uses their current obscurity to delete the data from a search engine, and then goes on to run in an election, isn&#x27;t this <i>exactly</i> when we should want to see all that is on the internet about them?

Plenty of the links that those removal requests are all about were placed by spamming comments, creating millions of bogus accounts across as many services in order to boost PR. That was done automatically.<p>So now, after the penalty hammer comes down the <i>automatically</i> placed junk supposedly has to be manually removed by the website where the spam was posted, usually accompanied by some vaguely threatening words to the effect of &#x27;if you don&#x27;t comply we&#x27;ll use the disavow tool&#x27;.<p>I wish them good luck and refuse to honour any of these requests, they can disavow until they&#x27;re blue in the face.<p>See, sending out those vaguely threatening emails is still almost at 0 penalty (it is an automated action) but using the google disavow tool requires a human.<p>Preferably google should add some really nasty captcha or hard to solve puzzle there for every link disavowed.",1401451689

Again, how is that &#x27;Europes&quot; fault?<p>You appear to acknowledge this, but just in case: it&#x27;s our (Europeans&#x27;) fault because we had two massive, hugely expensive, wars, which the Americans funded, providing them with an economic security that further compounded their preexisting view of their own exceptionalism.<p>This means that rather than appreciating the degree to which their position of strength was obtained through historical circumstance, they see it solely as a product of the superiority of their own way of life.<p>edit: Of more relevance to the story, this is interesting, though perhaps not to everyone&#x27;s taste: <a href=""http://www.philosophersmail.com/capitalism/the-rich-should-stop-giving-so-much-of-their-money-away/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.philosophersmail.com/capitalism/the-rich-should-s...</a>",1401451419

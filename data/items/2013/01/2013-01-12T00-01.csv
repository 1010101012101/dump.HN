<i>But reflect that a U.S. doctor might earn $600,000 per year, the nurses salary might be $120,000 per year, and the same task could be accomplished by a worker in India or Cambodia, starting from the unstructured data, at a cost of $2 per hour.</i><p>Let's assume I didn't already think this guy was way off the mark... that comment right there makes me think he's just an arrogant twat.

5045978,comment,5045518,5045518,2,0,tom_b,,,"Much of the EMR system I deal with was built primarily to address billing rather than patient care.  The structured data (ICD-9 codes, service dates, etc) exists for that.  The crufty part of the system is related to patient test results and other information (pathology reports related to tissue evaluations, etc).<p>So, the data that is tangential to patient treatment is highly queryable, the data related to patient status is mostly free text.  Worse yet, the free text does not follow much of a ""standard"" entry form - whoever entered the text followed, at best, a departmental standard, at worst, just some quick thoughts randomly sprayed into text.<p>But even that terribly inefficient and crufty free text is highly useful to staff (MDs, nurses, etc) when reviewing patient treatment during, say, tumor board meetings discussing specific cancer treatments and patient status.<p>What might be really nice would be to divorce the two functions - separate billing/scheduling from other information.  For the patient treatment/status data, there is some fine line in the data model with having some structured data, plus (probably) some flexible key/value annotation system.<p>One killer issue is that given any software tool, medical staff is smart enough to bend it to do what they want, rather than what it was designed for, if that makes sense.",1357952207

5045932,comment,5045518,5045847,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Your right of course, it was more rant than argument.<p>The paper claims that $1000 per patient is extortionate as compared against the 'free' cost of existing web based tools. However it never supports that claim except through that single comparison. Thus, I am not persuaded that $1000 per patient is extortionate.<p>Lets take that cost as legitimate. The structured system exists for the life time of the patients who use the hospital, so understanding that cost requires understanding how the cost of that system is recouped over the lifetime of the patient. Picking three cohorts, a 5 year patient, a 10 year patient, and a 25 year patient, they would have lifetime costs of $16/month, $8/month, and $3.33/month to recoup a $1000 cost to both enter them into the system and pay for the system (these costs weren't split out in the article).<p>One of the arguments for electronic records is a reduction in unneeded tests. So for example when Bob comes in for a physical do you order a cholesterol test or not? If the previous test is still valid, you don't, but if you miss the previous test in the record? The doctor re-orders the test ""to be sure."" which occurs because insurance companies can find you partially negligent if a test was available and you didn't order it but should have.<p>In order to quantify the 'value' of electronic records, either structured or un-structured, you really have to compare the patient costs for hospitals with such systems and those without. And any thorough treatment of that question would also cover the ingress process of a new patient coming from a hospital with a function structured electronic record capability and one without.<p>I can see why its hard to see that this was what I was saying in my original comment.",1357951375

But isn't the Warby of the bra world and they have not proven that their algorithm works. 1) True does NOT make the process of bra shopping easier. That's what Warby does best while offering a great product at a very affordable price. Warby has great branding. In fact, True takes a traditionally feminine and sexy product and makes shopping for it a BORING and painful experience. 3 minutes of questioning was boring. 2)There is no animosity towards the team. My post is no different than an article on Pando - actually it's no where as snarky some of the articles I've seen. Pando can be really, really snarky.

Have they done any claims testing? That's what consumer brands do when they have $ and they are trying to prove that their tech works. Otherwise, it's flimsy, BS marketing ==> No true fit, no true fitting algorithm. 4) Where are the panties? I could not find them after 10 minutes. It's worse that True says they sell them, but I couldn't find them after 10 minutes. The founders don't understand basic business, marketing or branding. That's key for a consumer goods business like a lingerie brand. 5)It's a shame because I do know several other BETTER lingerie startups that should have gotten funding which presented at DecodedFashion Lingerie Startup Showcase. One founder is in serious debt trying to get funding. Unfortunately she isn't a former VC, so fundraising is a lot harder for her.",1357950853

For example, if you changed the ""scrolling speed"" of a background between the drawing of every line, you could get a nifty ""parallax scrolling"" effect out of a machine with only 1 background layer. Or, you could change a color palette halfway through the screen to make it look like that part was underwater.<p>Some systems had interrupts that would fire in-between the drawing of lines to facilitate this. Other, simpler ones, like the NES and the C64, basically required the programmer to write perfectly timed, cycle accurate code that would poke the right values into video registers within a very small timing window.<p>The Amiga had a number of custom chipsets to make it easier to produce effects like this, and free the CPU from spinning idly and poking registers all the time. Looking at the wikipedia summary of its capabilities, I imagine console game programmers of the time would have killed for the ability to say ""please write this value here at this exact moment, thank you.""<p>It reminds me a bit of the SNES's HDMA (horizontal interrupt DMA) function, which allowed programmers to specify tables of data to be copied to certain VRAM registers in between the rendering of scanlines.

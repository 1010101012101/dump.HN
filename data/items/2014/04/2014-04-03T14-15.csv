7523275,comment,7522343,7522343,7,0,tokenadult,,,"Treatment of depression has improved enormously over the last four decades. It&#x27;s a tough treatment and research problem because depression isn&#x27;t just one disease at the biological level.<p>Quoting the full study abstract will probably be helpful to the discussion here.<p>&quot;Background: Ketamine has a rapid antidepressant effect in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The effects on cognitive function of multiple ketamine infusions and of concurrent antidepressant medication on response rate and duration are not known.\nMethod: Twenty-eight patients with uni- or bipolar TRD were treated over three weeks with either three or six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) in the recovery room of a routine ECT clinic. Post-treatment memory assessments were conducted on day 21 (4–7 days after the final infusion). Patients were followed up for six months where possible, with severity of depression and side effects monitored throughout.\nResults: Eight (29%) patients responded of whom four remitted. Only three (11%) patients had responded within six hours after a single infusion, but in all responders, the response had developed before the third infusion. The duration of response from the final infusion was variable (median 70, range 25–168 days). Discontinuations included two (7%) because of acute adverse reactions during the infusion and five (18%) because of failure to benefit and increasing anxiety. Ketamine was not associated with memory impairment. The ECT clinic was rated suitable by patients and offered appropriate levels of monitoring.\nConclusion: This small, open label naturalistic study shows that up to six low dose ketamine infusions can safely be given within an existing NHS clinical structure to patients who continue their antidepressants. The response rate was comparable to that found in RCTs of single doses of ketamine in antidepressant-free patients but took slightly longer to develop.&quot;<p>The free full text of the article reporting this preliminary finding can be found online.[1] (Hat tip to the participant here who first found the abstract link, which leads to the full-text link.)<p>Depression is maddeningly difficult to treat because it is quite clear on multiple grounds that not everyone with signs of depression (extremely persistent low mood contrary to the patient&#x27;s life circumstances) has the same underlying physical or psychological cause of depression. The human mood regulatory system is a SYSTEM, and as such it can be perturbed by a number of biochemical stressors internal to the patient, and also by a number of outside-the-patient environmental stressors (including sleep disturbance, already mentioned in this thread, and the use or abuse of various druggs). Not all patients have the same biological substrate to their depression, so not all patients will respond to the same treatment. To date, the most effective treatment for depression is a both-and of prescribed medication and professionally supervised talk therapy, and there is an active research program on identifying which patients respond to which medicines and to which kinds of talk therapy.[2]<p>In any research program on treatment of human subjects, the studies have to start with small numbers of subjects to verify safety of the treatment, and then gradually increase the number of subjects and add in double-blind protocols to verify both safety and effectiveness. (The study reported here is &quot;open label,&quot; not double-blind.) New treatments are usually tested first on patients who don&#x27;t respond to current treatments, as in the research reported here. It will be a long time before we know how helpful ketamine is compared to other treatments for depression, but that will be an ongoing program of research, and so far it looks somewhat promising.<p>[1] <a href=""http://jop.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/03/17/0269881114527361.full.pdf+html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jop.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/03/17/026988111452...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.psych.121208.131653?prevSearch=depression&searchHistoryKey="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.psych.1...</a>",1396537184

Helping Castro&#x27;s controlled economy before giving control of the government and said economy back to its people is unpopular. Allowing the Cuban people to communicate and band together within the country is attempted all the time by government-affiliated and independent organizations, most of which are in Miami and organized by Cuban-Americans. This seems like one of those attempts, sponsored by the USAID Office of Transition Initiatives[1]. If I were in charge of the project, I figure I&#x27;d probably also avoid giving this project a U.S. brand as to not catch the attention of Cuban censors or propagandists.<p>Networks are fully controlled by the Cuban government. Their &quot;Facebook&quot; is government built.[2] There are no social networks that are optimized for the tools (like satellite phones) they use to get around censors. At first glance, this seemed like a nice attempt at helping the Cubans get around these limitations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-democracy-conflict-and-humanitarian-assistance/office-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/02/cuba-launches-facebook-copycat-site-red-social_n_1125771.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/02/cuba-launches-faceb...</a>",1396537183

The fastest would indeed win if all hashing devices started at the same nonce value and all incremented it in the same way. (the nonce is the extra data put into the block solely to make the block&#x27;s hash meet the requirements) But precisely because of that, there is no reason for any device to try nonces in a deterministic way.<p>maaku&#x27;s explanation makes clear a very good point - trying any particular hash only tells you whether that one succeeds or fails; it doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about whether any other value will succeed or fail. Any particular hashing device will maximize its chances of winning/finding a solution by trying nonces in such a way that it is unlikely that any other device is trying the same ones, but that it never tries the same one itself twice.<p>I don&#x27;t know offhand how many mining algorithms are out there and how they go about picking nonces, but I&#x27;d bet they do something like pick a strongly random starting value and then increment it by a fixed, small amount each try.<p>But yes, all of the miner&#x27;s blocks are generally different. Each block that a miner is working on must have special Coinbase transaction that awards a specific number of new BTC to a chosen address. If you are an independent miner, that would be your address, but pool miners generally use a pool address.

You might answer that the US&#x27;s checkered past in foreign policy (coups, assassinations, drug wars, oil wars, supported rebellions, etc) will make the world suspicious <i>despite</i> our altruistic intensions here. But I think the rest of the world&#x27;s answer is simpler and more likely: our intentions are not altruistic, and this is merely another unprincipled application of power to obtain a goal. That checkered past is good evidence, and there&#x27;s no reason this is different just because &quot;social media&quot; is a magic word or something. For example, why are we trying to undermine Cuba&#x27;s regime but not Saudi&#x27;s? Because our policy goals only pretend to care about dictatorships. And if we care so much about the Cuban people, why do we have a trade embargo against them?<p>Which is why no one trusts us and, frankly, shouldn&#x27;t trust us. Building a platform that you&#x27;ll use to &quot;push them toward dissent&quot; isn&#x27;t providing a medium for free thought and reform; it&#x27;s psychological warfare. We&#x27;re trying to capture the attention of people and then trick them into doing what we want.<p>&quot;So what?&quot; you say. &quot;Even if the goals are selfish and strategic, democracy is still good, and Cuba would clearly be better off without a dictator.&quot; That&#x27;s certainly possible, but I doubt it. For starters, our involvement taints any actual emerging democratic movement with the notion that it&#x27;s just another arm of US foreign policy. I&#x27;d <i>like</i> to live in a world where an asshole strong arm dictator can&#x27;t blame &quot;US meddling&quot; for any unrest without being dismissed out of hand, but sadly, I don&#x27;t live in that world. So we&#x27;re really undermining that goal by playing directly into the (mostly correct) notion that the US isn&#x27;t looking out for other countries&#x27; best interests. Maybe we should stop trying to interfere everywhere, because to the extent that our intentions are good in the first place, we&#x27;re no good at it.<p>But more importantly, it&#x27;s not really clear that actual democracy is the natural result of this kind of thing. If driven by US involvement, will a grassroots rebellion against the Cuban regime actually result in an open, honest democracy or will it devolve into a feeding frenzy for US interests, led by US-friendly politicians pushed into place by US operatives? The US has installed enough dictatorships and phony democracies for me to think this is more likely. When you use democracy as a veneer, I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d expect it to really work.",1396537041

7523220,comment,7511749,7511749,1,0,vfclists,,,"I just got my first taste of HN censorship from my earlier comment about the reason why a white father insisting on describing his mixed race son as black is quite wrong and the subconsciously racist intent underlying it, love of offspring notwithstanding. I am rephrasing it and restarting it.<p>If the writer is white then the son is arguably as white as he is black, and probably more white than black if the mother is an African American, as opposed to an African immigrant. So why the insistence on the father labeling him as black just because society sees him as such? Society can learn to see him as white if white fathers insist on claiming whiteness for him. Why does the notion of whiteness exclude any racial mixture when black does? Why should whiteness be exclusive and the father go along with that?<p>The real issue is the way society is programmed by calculated use of language. If the One Drop Rule was switched around most racial discrimination would end, because discrimination would then be based on shade of complexion not race.\nWhites would be light-skinned whites, mixed race people would simply be medium-skinned whites and most African Americans would be dark-skinned whites from their slave-owning fathers. Or the definition could be reversed and white people would be very light-skinned blacks. The idiocy of this defacto continuation of the ODR is that is that it makes whiteness exclusive and black becomes some kind of genetic taint, some kind of condition/affliction which causes lots people who are &#x27;white&#x27; socially, genetically and culturally for all practical purposes to be labelled as &#x27;black&#x27;.<p>That rule was made to ensure that wealth and privilege remained in the hands of white people, to ensure the formation of a predominantly and visibly white aristocracy and check the breeding preferences of resident or immigrant European nobility whose appearance was visibly that of light-skinned blacks.\nTake this instance of a prince of Liechtenstein <a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LMfYsqYUdxY/UCaj_85tH2I/AAAAAAAAEU4/sa2MkgV1wkE/s1600/black_princess_angela.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LMfYsqYUdxY/UCaj_85tH2I/AAAAAAAAEU...</a>. If American had more men like his father in ranking positions,  his complexion might even be  identified with aristocracy and how often would police harass males like him and risk losing their jobs? By being labeled as black it only helps rationalize the harassment.<p>What is there to stop white fathers insisting that their sons be seen as white and have all the privileges that come with it and punish policemen who stepped out of line? This father&#x27;s refusal to view and label his son as white masks a hardly unconscious reluctance to demand the same privileges he has for his son and by extension <i></i>any other men of a similar appearance<i></i>. If they got to be seen as white and also married black females the same privilege would be extended to their even darker sons and this issue would simply go away.<p>The continued use of black to describe mixed race people, even multiple generations of &#x27;blacks&#x27; who are mixed is simply a refusal to accept the fact that a white and Nordic-oriented exclusivity in a multiracial America is a myth, downright anomalous and is actually Nazism of the worst kind. Isn&#x27;t it glaringly obvious how Hispanic is used to pull in lots of people who would be Black, Native American or both under the One Drop Rule, ie &#x27;light-skinned blacks&#x27;?<p>Unfortunately the use of the term black by that white father is just a sop to white exclusivity supremacists.<p>European is a culture not a race.",1396536801

What&#x27;s interesting about it is that it tells the story of how outsiders modeled the various ways to rip off <institutional> traders. They did this first and the empirically pattern-matched observed behaviour. They then did both physical and social market-micro-structure studies.<p>Lets take a look at this section (From attached article):<p><i>The fact of the matter is that HFT’s can’t rip you off. You are never under any obligation to do business with them. In spite of that, lots of sophisticated investors voluntarily pay HFTs every day. An important question for all the critics of HFT to grapple with is, “why do sophisticated investors voluntarily pay for something useless?”</i><p>This comes right after the section on why people don&#x27;t adopt obvious strategies (use limit orders, etc):<p><i>Why doesn’t everyone do this?<p>This is an obvious question to ask. The answer is, quite simply, execution risk. Execution risk is the risk that you place an order but your trade never actually happens.</i><p>The Analysis Lewis outlines in his book shows that HFT is specificially engineered <to create execution risk>. It engineers artificial scarcity (the opposite of liquidity). Empirical study from Lewis&#x27;s book:<p><i>Finally [The Trader] complained so loudly that they sent the developers, the guys who came to RBC in the Carlin acquisition. “They told me it was because I was in New York and the markets were in New Jersey and my market data was slow,” Katsuyama says. “Then they said that it was all caused by the fact that there are thousands of people trading in the market. They’d say: ‘You aren’t the only one trying to do what you’re trying to do. There’s other events. There’s news.’ ”\n<If that was the case, he asked them, why did the market in any given stock dry up only when he was trying to trade in it?> [emphasis added] To make his point, he asked the developers to stand behind him and watch while he traded. “I’d say: ‘Watch closely. I am about to buy 100,000 shares of AMD. I am willing to pay $15 a share. There are currently 100,000 shares of AMD being offered at $15 a share — 10,000 on BATS, 35,000 on the New York Stock Exchange, 30,000 on Nasdaq and 25,000 on Direct Edge.’ You could see it all on the screens. We’d all sit there and stare at the screen, and I’d have my finger over the Enter button. I’d count out loud to five. . . .\n“ ‘One. . . .\n“ ‘Two. . . . See, nothing’s happened.\n“ ‘Three. . . . Offers are still there at 15. . . .\n“ ‘Four. . . . Still no movement. . . .\n“ ‘Five.’ Then I’d hit the Enter button, and — boom! — all hell would break loose. The offerings would all disappear, and the stock would pop higher.”</i><p>This is why it&#x27;s being investigated by the FBI, in addition the other issues (front running, NPI, etc).<p><i>&quot;There are many people in government who are very focused on this and who are concerned about it and who think it breaks the law,&quot; an FBI spokesman said. &quot;There is a big concern that high-frequency traders are getting material nonpublic information ahead of others and trading on it.&quot;</i>",1396536652

They are also working, whereas chances are that &#x27;Microsoft&#x27;, &#x27;Vodafone&#x27; or any of the other big-brand, knowledge economy employers of the area probably would not employ them.

Here the job pays minimum wage and nobody sticks at it for very long. There is no benefit in doing it as the money is barely any more than income support and any overtime is swallowed up by tax. Consequently there is a high amount of churn as people give it a go to get off the employment register and prove to the government that they are willing to work, then, one way or another, they jack it in.<p>So how would that work out in a &#x27;basic income&#x27; economy in some rural town where there are no jobs? I think it would still work out rather well, even if the pay was £10K after tax + Basic Income.

From the perspective of a database engine, operating systems do a lot of &quot;dumb&quot; things with resource management and scheduling in ways that are essentially impossible to avoid that the database engine has enough context to do intelligently on its own. OS bypass in a database can have substantial performance benefits and add robustness for many edge cases. The obvious downside is that you basically end up rewriting the operating system in userspace, minus the device drivers, which is an enormous amount of work. It is not an incremental kind of design approach and it makes portability difficult. PostgreSQL actually does a really good job trying to be fast and robust without going to bypass internals.<p>I&#x27;ve always asserted that the reason we&#x27;ve never seen a proper kernel bypass database engine in open source is that the Minimum Viable Product is too complex. A bare, stripped-down, low-level database engine that does full bypass of the operating system is usually <i>at least</i> 100kLoC of low-level C/C++, and that is before you add all the features a database user will actually want.

If that is the case, by definition you are not a retail investor, you are an institutional investor and part of the value add you are supposedly adding is your ability to operate in a complex market.<p>&quot;2) It&#x27;s a universal truth that people who are better informed are harder to rip off.

And if transparency with regard to HFT trading strategies leads regular people and sophisticated investors to make different decisions, then that means that the lack of transparency worked in favor of HFT. Therefore, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume much of the HFT profits are just an externality. The decline of HFT is in part because investors are getting wise to the shenanigans.&quot;<p>Agreed.

I believe AngularJS is a very intuitive framework.<p>When you write in AngularJS, you forget the nitty-gritty DOM manipulation, you just care about your data. AngularJS changes DOM for you. A Controller holds the data. AngularJS keeps the view updated with the data in the controller. You need to fetch data from somewhere such as REST API? Just ask for it, AngularJS gives you $resource. Just like that. No initialization, handling dependencies. Feeling there&#x27;s code bloat in your controller? Extract a service and AngularJS will make it singleton for you and pass it whenever you need! Need to filter data before displaying it? Write a filter! Directives are bit difficult, I understand, but all the rest of stuff is easy and very intuitive.<p>Microsoft folks have been writing MVVM apps in WPF and Silverlight for nearly a decade now, writing their own DelegateCommand, using an IoC container, using an ORM and plugging all these things together.

If employer A allows less than 40 hour work weeks, or more vacation, he can be beaten out in the market by employer B which mandates longer hours and produces more per time period. Employees might prefer A over B, but they have so little bargaining power that this will not stop B. If the same requirements are imposed on all employers, then the country will be out-competed by others.<p>2. Conservatives criticize any such proposal with an argument like this: &quot;You should be free to use your property as you wish, including by having people work as long as you can get them to agree to.

7522908,comment,7522520,7522520,7,0,AlwaysBCoding,,,"I agree with this post. The worst thing about Angular is how confusing it is, particularly when it does not have to be at all. There are at least 10 things I can think of off the top of my head that are so confusing about Angular that could easily be much simpler that it tells me the framework creators must not care about understandabiltiy at all. I think for a JS framework this is a death wish, but we&#x27;ll see.<p>Just some examples:<p>1. When you create a directive you initialize it with one of three different kinds of scopes. A parent scope (which is the actual controller scope object), a child scope (which prototypically inherits from the controller scope), or an isolate scope (which is an isolated scope with inheritance only to rootScope). If you don&#x27;t explicitly define a scope you get a parent scope. If you write `scope: true` you get a child scope. If you write `scope: {}` you get an isolate scope. This is so fucking confusing for beginners. Why not just explicitly define what kind of scope you want so it&#x27;s clear?<p>2. Every single example of learn AngularJS online, even examples from the &#x27;official documentation&#x27; (that&#x27;s in quotes because Angular&#x27;s documentation is so atrocious that referring to it as documentation would be bastardizing the English language) give you examples of defining services, controllers and directives directly on the top-level ng-app module when in reality doing this is catastrophic and will make your app IMPOSSIBLE to unit test. You need to define services in their own modules that get aggregated into the ng-app module so you can unit test them, but there are no examples of that anywhere.<p>3. Speaking of unit testing, because it&#x27;s supposed to be so easy in Angular right? You have this thing called angular.mock.module that&#x27;s the key to everything. Now &#x27;angular.mock.module&#x27; is different from &#x27;angular.module&#x27; but is for some reason aliased to &#x27;module&#x27; because that&#x27;s not confusing or anything. Now you would expect for angular.mock.module to be just that, a mock module. BUT it&#x27;s actually a module that depends on the angular &#x27;ng&#x27; module meaning that it&#x27;s not really a mock module at all, it&#x27;s a module that includes the ENTIRE working Angular library. So you can use the &#x27;mock&#x27; module to get the REAL injector and use that to get your REAL services which you put into the mock module to use in your tests. The entire flow is so confusing and non-descriptive that it&#x27;s a wonder a beginner is ever even able to write a working unit test much less a good one. The funny part is all you hear about is &quot;unit testing is so easy in Angular omgz&quot; when really it&#x27;s confusing as fuck but the Angular crew seems completely oblivious to that fact.<p>--- I could honestly write a book about my Angular rants, this is just barely skimming the surface, but the point is, Angular makes things hard and confusing when they don&#x27;t need to be. I like the way Angular organizes code, but I&#x27;m willing to switch at the drop of a dime if something simpler comes along.",1396534493

Austria for example has some really good deals, so maybe I will go with a carrier from there. And with SEPA even billing should not be an issue.<p>The other (intended) thing this will spur is further consolidation of the EU Telecoms market as there will suddenly be a much larger number of competing players on the market. As I said, in principle Austrian Telecoms are now for the first time directly competing for customers with Spanish Telecoms in Germany, so I guess we&#x27;ll see a lot more mergers in the close future. Which might turn out to be anticompetitive in the long run, mind.<p>(I blogged about it here [1] in more detail and with a few more resources, in case anyone is interested.

To judge from the behaviour and the achievements of the wealthy classes to-day in any quarter of the world, the outlook is very depressing! For these are, so to speak, our advance guard – those who are spying out the promised land for the rest of us and pitching their camp there.

We shall do more things for ourselves than is usual with the rich to-day, only too glad to have small duties and tasks and routines. But beyond this, we shall endeavour to spread the bread thin on the butter – to make what work there is still to be done to be as widely shared as possible.

But retrospective studies have a well-deserved and terrible reputation for confusing causes and effects.<p>So do the double-blind studies you appear to be advocating. Ever thought of what exactly the placebo effect is and what some causes might be ?<p>> Apart from your obviously false claim, The &quot;medical establishment&quot; are not scientists and are not competent to make that call. They are not researchers, they are practitioners of methods developed by others.<p>The medical establishment are people who treat the sick, mostly. They observe that they regularly have people who come in with nutritional deficiencies because they are vegetarians and didn&#x27;t follow the diets properly. One look at such a diet tells you exactly why this happens. Second is that you observe that vegetarianism and eating disorders go hand in hand.<p>You know what contains every single substance your body needs on a daily basis, all vitamins, minerals, calcium, you name it and will prevent nearly every food disorder, and it&#x27;s hypo-allergenic (meaning perfectly safe for very nearly every patient you have) ? A 150gr steak. The only thing it doesn&#x27;t have is sufficient calories, so you should also have something starchy with it. (And to be pedantic, it&#x27;s the fatty tissue in the steak that&#x27;s the main source of it&#x27;s good properties. And yes, we&#x27;re talking a rare to medium steak here)<p>You know what vegetarian food contains every single substance your body needs on a daily basis ... None. What should a vegetarian eat daily ?\n* Nuts\n* Beans\n* Spinach or soy (or tofu, even if that&#x27;s less ideal)\n* Sunlight (yes, really), or Vitamin D supplements\n* Vitamin B12 supplements<p>Needless to say, this list is very much not hypo-allergenic, there is a significant fraction of the population (not that many, granted, but you have to check) that will swell up and start convulsing if you feed this to them. There are obviously other vegetarian diets, but they have similar problems.<p>True, missing one of these for a day is very much unlikely to kill you, but prolonged shortages will. Also keep in mind that you should never raise a kid vegetarian, because that is much riskier than being vegetarian as adults. There have been cases of kids dying because of vegan diets.<p>What I find extremely convenient is the physical symptoms of low-level protein deficiency. First : it&#x27;s really, really bad for you. But the initial symptoms are sleeping more, weight loss and tissue loss (ie. not just fatty tissue). That&#x27;s imho why people do this : because it slims you down.<p>Incidentally, the one thing that is confirmed to slim you down by removing fatty tissue is cold. And if you don&#x27;t overdo it (e.g. go swimming in a 24 degree water pool) it is quite safe. It&#x27;s not about feeling cold, merely about increasing your body&#x27;s heat loss.<p>[1] <a href=""http://anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu/pdf/8373.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu/pdf/8373.pdf</a>",1396534043

Hopefully the OP meant &quot;overcomplicated&quot; or &quot;I tried to learn it and it was beyond my ability&quot;, but saying that something will fail because it&#x27;s difficult is just stupid.<p>Besides, even if Angular were to fail overnight, right now. The download sites go dark, the team is disbanded and starts working on something else, I&#x27;d argue that Angular has already succeeded by showing everyone a new way to tackle single apps and how to structure Javascript applications.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;m pretty sure Angular is going to be around for quite a while.",1396533708

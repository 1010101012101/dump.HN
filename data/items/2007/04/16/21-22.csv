Every women and girl out there knows theknot is where you go to plan weddings. theknot is featured in every women magazine available.  Heck, I don't plan on getting married anytime soon and I even know you go to theknot.<p>But hey,  it's cool they're trying new things out but they seriously need talk to women before diving into a woman industry related area.

13396,comment,13343,13343,0,0,vlad,,,"Great essay.<p>I disagree that you can or should only protest those judgements about you specifically, but I do agree with the entire second half of your essay.<p>I agree with the idea behind the essay, that ""If it doesn't matter to someone else whether they choose you, then the other party has the leverage.  You want to put yourself in positions where you have the leverage.""  For example, if you apply to a college, and thousands of applicants are just like you, then you don't have leverage.<p>Your examples just ignore the fact that people get rejected from about 4 colleges a year, while they have a chance to correct their tests and homeworks about 1,000 times a semester.<p>This means that the numbers simply don't match up.  If you appealed 1,000 college decisions, you would have a great chance to get into a lot of them.  If you appealed 1,000 questions on a homework to one busy and egotistical professor, they would likely start avoiding you after the 10th question.<p>Therefore, people SHOULD appeal everything they want to, whether the judgement is specifically about them or not.<p>I saw that this was written originally as a post to a question about YC decisions.   As far as advice about YC, I think the best explanation of why some people were rejected is that there is a hidden bias (though very well earned) to hang around with people you think you'll find interesting or ideas you think you'd love or have a lot to contribute to over the summer.",1176757903

What really matters is the article's relative rankings - which (roughly) determine the article's placement on the main page.<p>And that's what makes News.YC so appealing.

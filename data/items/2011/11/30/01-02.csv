Even if a professor wanted to switch, Blackboard integration in higher ed is far deeper than a single class. Higher ed and enterprise is exceptionally difficult to disrupt when it comes to institution-level installations. There's a reason many orgs are STILL using Windows XP and IE 6. Fighting institutional inertia is massively difficult.<p>If coursekit wants to accomplish that goal though, they should take a facebook approach -- one school at a time. Convince some small school that isn't using Blackboard to try their software. Then expand the school targets outward to adjacent schools in the geographic region.

I've found Java overly restrictive in the past, and have spent time learning Python, Haskell and other languages (and seen decent increases in productivity when I feel less fettered by the language I'm programming in).  That said, I've also come to appreciate the effect of more restrictive languages: readability and long-term maintainability.

It's not so much a fault of the language (one can debate the semantics of it), so much as it is an outcome of greater-than n-sized (where n is 1, 2, maybe 3) non-high-expert-Scala-users teams. The lack of an easy to grok idiomatic way of writing code is hard on a team.

3293261,comment,3292555,3292555,16,0,sreque,,,"@codahale, was this email from you or someone else in your company?<p>Judging from your blog post a year ago at <a href=""http://eng.yammer.com/blog/tag/scala"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eng.yammer.com/blog/tag/scala</a>, at one point you thought Scala was great. As someone who still thinks Scala is great, I would like to know how long it took you to change your mind and what triggered you to reach this realization. When it comes down to it, I've never developed Scala as part of a team or worked on a project more than a few thousand lines of code, so I definitely lack the experience you probably have with the language and runtime.<p>As to the email itself, I find the complaints about performance most uninsightful, and I say this as someone who has written CPU-intensive NLP code in Scala. Anyone who writes performant code to run on the JVM knows that the only way to get C-like performance in Java is to, it turns out, write C-like code in Java!<p>That means operating only on primitives and arrays of primitives when in tight loops. It means avoiding allocations as much as possible. It even means avoiding generics like the plague, including java.util.HashMap. In my NLP code, for instance, I got at least a 100x speed up by switching from HashMaps with string keys to arrays by manually interning each string into an incremented number. One library I used, called Mallet, relied on GNU trove to have hash maps without boxing of primitives, because for high performance, even java.util.HashMap is too slow!<p>This means that, if you want amazing performance in Scala, you have to write C-like code in Scala as well. I'd expect anyone who needs top-notch performance to know this kind of thing already. Writing performant code in any high-level language in our day and age, even C++, still requires you to understand how your abstractions are actually getting implemented underneath the hood. Scala doesn't work miracles  here or everyone would probably be using it already.<p>Just ask the people who run JGit about performant JVM code. (<a href=""http://marc.info/?l=git&m=124111702609723&w=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?l=git&m=124111702609723&w=2</a>) They ran into a ton of cases where they couldn't write the equivalent C-code in Java and performance suffered as a consequence.<p>However, the points about the build toolchain, backwards binary compatibility, and to some extent, initial learning complexity are the ones that I think are most damning against Scala. I hope Typesafe has a good response to this or other companies step up to share how they worked around these deficiencies successfully. Otherwise, I feel like this could be potentially very damaging to Scala's reputation, and maybe even deservedly so.",1322617486

Don't get snarky when I don't answer your unsound question the way you hoped.<p>><i>The amount of power that people grant to the government depends on the level of results people expect government to achieve.</i>\n><i>The more power people give to the government, the better results government can achieve.</i><p>No, the government takes the level of power that it can. The government regularly does things that the populace does not support. Don't pretend that all government powers are granted by the people. Or if you want to believe that, please explain how you would take a power away from the government.<p>And no, more powerful does not imply more effective. Totalitarian states are basically all-powerful (in terms of powers we've been dscussing) yet most of them have historically also been ineffective (except perhaps at retaining power).<p>><i>The reason why it's possible is that more informed government would be able to accomplish the same positive effect by arresting 1 suspect instead of arresting 10.</i><p>You're just making things up now. On what basis to you make this claim? I say that an ""informed"" government arrests <i>more</i> people, because they can find more ""probable causes"" to do so.<p>> <i>So within that model what would be your choice? Cut surveillance and increase ability of government to interfere with our lives?</i><p>I choose less of both.

Set up OSCommerce or Magento site with design roughly copied from legit rights owner.\n2. Get local 'middleman' to donate paypal account in return for small cut\n3. Buy a bucket load of adwords\n4. Run massive scale xrumer / scrapebox / etc 'SEO' campaign\n5. Repeat thousands of times over<p>Getting domains de-indexed via the DMCA process on Google, never mind taking after-the-fact legal action, is just treating the symptoms.<p>Given that Paypal and Google are at the forefront of this issue, they are where the responsibility lies in terms of preventing the sites from transacting: by denying them a payment method and heaps of traffic respectively. I am sure that both companies are working hard on this issue, but having looked at the problem over the past couple of years, it hasn't always seemed to be that much of a priority.<p>Beyond that it is basically a question of international trade treaties and better local law enforcement in the territories where the offenders operate (predominately China) - i.e. NOT an easy fix.<p>You can understand the frustration of rights owners who are obviously going to take every opportunity to use legal action domestically.  If they get a fairly tech illiterate decision in their favour that has potential dangerous consequences for the internet at large, then this is as much because they are just swinging at everything (back to those moles) than any great desire on their part to restrict legitimate rights and freedoms.<p>Finally, it is important to realise that this is not a victimless crime. What brought this home to me was a few years back when I overheard a nurse in the neonatal unit my son was being looked after in at the time excitedly talking about a pair of brand name boots she'd bought on the internet.<p>I realised that she had absolutely no clue they were fake because why should she?  She had found the legitimate-looking site on the first page of Google and had paid with Paypal.<p>This was not a transaction carried out 'out the back of a van', where caveat emptor might more readily apply. A lot (majority?) of consumers don't realise that for all the brand loyality they might have in respect of Google and Paypal, etc^, they are services that are easily misused by unrelated third parties and so should not be taken as any sort of 'trust mark' in they way that shopping in large well-known department store does.<p>^Amazon and eBay deserve honourable mentions as being popular conduits for counterfeit scams too (although eBay in particular deserves a lot of credit for taking the subject more seriously than most).",1322616772

One of the programs, Half-Life Sound Selector (HLSS), annoyed countless people by allowing players to blast WAV files over the voice comm system. Really, really annoying. Another program, HLirc, interfaced with HL and mIRC, letting you chat in IRC using the game's console, until VAC started detecting it (incorrectly) as a cheat and banned you that is. The other program was a Winamp plugin called HLamp. It let you control Winamp from inside the game and even tell others what song you were listening to.

Concerned about counterfeiting, Chanel has filed a joint suit in Nevada against nearly 700 domain names that appear to have nothing in common. When Chanel finds more names, it simply uses the same case and files new requests for more seizures. (A recent November 14 order went after an additional 228 sites; none had a chance to contest the request until after it was approved and the names had been seized.)<p>How were the sites investigated? For the most recent batch of names, Chanel hired a Nevada investigator to order from three of the 228 sites in question. When the orders arrived, they were reviewed by a Chanel official and declared counterfeit. The other 225 sites were seized based on a Chanel anti-counterfeiting specialist browsing the Web.</i><p>I'm not sure how that can be misconstrued. Chanel pays an expert who puts together a list and they are automatically banned. Each site can then, and only then, try to get some review. Chanel picks and chooses who to take sites away from, then the site owners -- if they have the resources -- can try to get things sorted out. Seems pretty straightforward to me (if completely whacked) Yes, I extrapolate that situation into the future, but that's the purpose of commentary: to use analogy and extrapolation to show facets of the article that aren't immediately apparent to the reader. I never said that brands own the internet now. I simply said that if things keep going this way, this is where we are going to end up.",1322615514

There's a family of examples with design patterns, where what is a design pattern in a less expressive language like Java requiring a standard arrangement of classes, is absorbed into the language in a more expressive language. The ""design pattern"" is a kind of redundant overhead. Describing examples is a bit involved, because you have to describe both the pattern and the expressive alternative.<p>One concrete example is the visitor pattern, which is more simply written with multi-methods (a multi-method is one that is dynamically selected by the type of its arguments - though Java can have methods with the same name but different arguments, they are selected statically, based on compile-time types rather than runtime classes).<p>I actually can't think of any other examples off the top of my head, but  ""design patterns are language features in more expressive languages"" is a common idea, so I'm sure others can suggest other examples (or google).<p><i>EDIT</i> here we go (includes a list of examples) <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AreDesignPatternsMissingLanguageFeatures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AreDesignPatternsMissingLanguageFeatu...</a>",1322614873

1517632,comment,1517339,1517339,0,0,steveplace,,,"Since everyone has said no so far, I'll go ahead and say it's possible, but very difficult.<p>HFT algo commission is much lower than $10/trade. IBKR offers 0.008/sh, and it can get much lower if you trade in volume.<p>Like others said, it is a game of milliseconds. So you need to own a server near the exchanges in new york (i.e. <a href=""http://www.ubiquityservers.com/data-center/new-york.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubiquityservers.com/data-center/new-york.php</a>).<p>The best way to start learning is develop algos <i>not</i> for HFT. Instead of milliseconds think about 15 min - daily holds. If you're trading under 25k, you're only allowed to make 3 intraday trades a week.<p>So find a broker that has a FIX api, buy some data for backtesting, code some stuff out using R/python, and forward test your strat using papertrading for about a month-- then put real money to work.",1279198652

1517629,comment,1517059,1517059,0,0,tzs,,,"Really simple test: can you write blob of code X without having access to any source code or other copyrightable elements of blob of code Y?<p>If the answer is yes, then blob of code X is not a derivative work of blob of code Y. You can distribute X without any liability for direct copyright infringement of Y's copyrights.<p>Third party U might combine X and Y in memory, forming a derivative work of both X and Y. If the license of Y does not allow this, then U would be guilty of copyright infringement of Y.<p>It is possible that the developer of X could also be liable for U's infringement, if X essentially is only useful in cases where someone (like U) is using X to infringe Y. This is called contributory infringement.<p>In the case where the license of Y is GPL (or pretty much any other free software or open source license...), U's actions are not an infringement. If U's action are not an infringement, then X <i></i>cannot<i></i> be liable for contributory infringement.<p>I've not written any Wordpress themes, so don't know what you need to actually write one. Do you need to actually have the Wordpress source code in order to write a theme? Or do you only need a list of functions available in that code and their interfaces and a description of what they do? If the latter, then a theme would NOT automatically be a derivative work, and hence would not automatically need to be under GPL.<p>Much of this has already been litigated, going way back to the early video game systems, when third party game companies started releasing unauthorized game cartridges. When the user inserts a game cartridge, a single work is formed in the console comprising the system software and the game software. The game software makes calls to functions in the console. The console makers tried almost the same argument the SFLC makes in their analysis that someone else posted here. The console makers lost. This is one of the main reasons that consoles nowadays rely on technology (such as loaders that only load code signed by the console maker), not law, to keep out unauthorized third party games.",1279198578

There are, however, numerous cases where the code being called was not GPL, and they have pretty much universally ruled that the FSF position is wrong--blob of code X calling into blob of code Y does NOT make X a derivative work of Y.",1279196366

However, in the process of writing a book I've discovered a whole new level of frustration.  To be fair, there have been mistakes put down on the page and I fully expect that they be criticized.  However, as soon as the face-to-face aspect of criticism is eliminated people lose their damn minds.  I imagine 50 years ago there were boundless trolls writing their screeds to local newspapers.  However, thanks to the Internet those guys have no barrier preventing their vitriol.  As much as you try to avoid letting it bother you, the constant barrage is exhausting.  I can't even imagine what it must be like for someone of Yegge or pg's readership.<p>As a teen I worked at a record shop.  99% of all customers were nice, courteous, or at worst disregard my existence.

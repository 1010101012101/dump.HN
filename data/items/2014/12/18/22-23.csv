They work best where we have 5 different common orifices for fluid that need to be merged into one.  When they wear out, we order new ones.<p>We pay a tech who knows CAD and a fab house rather than a machine shop.  A machine shop would probably cost a lot more.  Although now that we have the design down pat, we wouldn&#x27;t waste as much money on prototypes.<p>Our design includes 2&quot; diameter threaded ends and it holds pretty firmly although the threads do wear out and tear off the tube with vibration and heat changes.",1418943560

8770163,comment,8767073,8768117,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"The original complaint for the US case remains available online from the DoJ: <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f1700/1763.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f1700/1763.htm</a><p>There are four bases for the complaint, two under Sec. 1 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and two under Sec. 2 of the Act.<p>1.  Unlawful Exclusive Dealing and Other \nExclusionary Agreements in Violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act (deals with ISPs, Internet Content Providers, and others that traded favorable promotional placement in the then-monopoly Windows OS for commitments not to license, promote, or distribute non-Microsoft products, particularly browsers.)<p>2. Unlawful Tying in Violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act (distributing the browser, a separate product based on market demand, etc., with its monopoly Windows OS system.)<p>3. Monopolization of the PC Operating \nSystems Market in Violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act (willfully maintaining monopoly power over that market by &quot;by anticompetitive and unreasonably exclusionary conduct.&quot;)<p>4. Attempted Monopolization of the Internet \nBrowser Market in Violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act (targetting &quot;software products that have the potential to compete with or facilitate the development of products to compete with PC operating systems and thereby to erode Microsoft&#x27;s Windows operating system monopoly&quot; by way of &quot;including tying and unreasonably exclusionary agreements, in order to obtain a monopoly in the Internet browser market&quot;.)<p>Note that a key issue in all of these is Microsoft&#x27;s then-existing monopoly power in the PC OS market and how it was defending or leveraging that in different markets -- without that monopoly power, much of what they were doing would not have even arguably been an antitrust issue.<p>Browser+OS wasn&#x27;t the issue, it was one of the mechanisms -- unreasonable and anticompetitive action to maintain an existing monopoly, and to leverage that monopoly into a monopoly in another market, was the issue.<p>> However it still doesn&#x27;t explain why Internet Explorer was the target when there is so much other software that was bundled with Windows, which too had for profit competitors?<p>Because the browser was the area where the government felt they had the best case for two key features: (1) that the tying, etc., was intended to leverage the existing monopoly to monopolize another market, and, (2) that the tying, etc., was intended to neutralize a threat to Microsoft&#x27;s existing monopoly.<p>Bundling two products together isn&#x27;t generally illegal. Doing so as a means to leverage a monopoly in one market to monopolize another, or to defuse a threat to an existing monopoly (and, <i>a fortiori</i>, to serve both purposes simultaneously) is a different story.<p>>  Those people who exclusively used Internet Explorer as &quot;the Internet&quot; would too have used the bundled mail client (I can&#x27;t remember what it was called back in the day) exclusively too and seen that as &quot;the email&quot;?<p>The bundled email client wasn&#x27;t an issue <i>because it didn&#x27;t exist yet</i> -- Outlook Express wasn&#x27;t bundled with Windows until Windows 98, which was still pending at the time the lawsuit was drafted (the complaint notes at para. 57: &quot;Beginning in or around June 1998, Microsoft will introduce to the market the latest version of its operating system for Intel-based PCs, Windows 98.&quot;)",1418943417

Cuba spends $300 per citizen on health care, the US spends $7000. I spent $5000 personally just this year on health care and I&#x27;m young and healthy.<p>Those in capitalist countries are getting fleeced, and Cuba shows us that. If Cuban socialism didn&#x27;t exist I couldn&#x27;t point out these facts, and that is why Cuban socialism was such a threat and why the US has acted so insecure towards the tiny island&#x27;s revolution.<p>I don&#x27;t want the US to adopt the Cuban system, I just believe we had no right to violate their sovereignty, and having different political systems out there lets us have a sort of A/B test for politics. I don&#x27;t believe a global political and economic monoculture is healthy.<p>As an American I wouldn&#x27;t want to trade places at birth with a Cuban, but if I had the choice between being born to asset-less parents in Jamaica or asset-less parents in Cuba, I know I would be healthier, more materially secure and far safer from violent crime in Cuba.

On the contrary, I think the attitude that everyone needs to wear suits in court because &quot;respect the court, or the executive won&#x27;t&quot; is detrimental to those already marginalized: the poor and less educated. They are probably less likely to recognize the social signalling that the formal attire represents.<p>My secondary point, apologies for the lack of clarity, is that relaxing courtroom procedures and the mystique surrounding them would allow for greater transparency. Greater transparency and a more approachable set of procedures would allow for greater understanding throughout the general population. A greater understanding of our legal system (my second definition of respect), minus the fluff surrounding it (language, attire, etc.), would be a good thing in my book.<p>I understand that there is inherent complexity in matters of finesse, whether it be law, engineering, or programming, but I don&#x27;t think we need to actively propagate stifling behaviors like suggesting that suits (and the equivalent for women) must be worn at all times, forever, in the courtroom.",1418943189

But that will probably not help them build a really advanced game with a scalable back-end. If that is something they need they might have to spend years learning and building. Or they might need to get help. Simple web programming is also easy but it might not lead to the most highly paid jobs directly, if a better salary is what they are after. It is however a good way to start and you can learn more about advanced programming or back-end programming later.

8770030,comment,8769944,8769944,0,0,tptacek,,,"For dev/tech hiring, the answer is straightforward: deprecate person-to-person interviews in favor of work-sample testing. Take a simple project your team has built, carefully carve out some functionality from it, document it, and then have your candidates implement that functionality. The sample should be runnable in its incomplete state and should be accompanied by some record of what good output is.<p>Evaluate candidates on code that they write <i>for your hiring process</i> (<i>not</i> on what they&#x27;ve posted on Github).<p>Additional tips:<p>* Pre-interview every candidate with someone clueful whose job is to (a) sell the company to the candidate and (b) to over-answer questions about the interview process. A surprising amount of interview jitters come from candidates not having visibility into the process.<p>* Try to eliminate phone interviews entirely. They don&#x27;t add value, but do amplify noise. Companies routinely evict candidates from the pipeline based on assessments of &quot;confidence&quot; or &quot;passion&quot; or &quot;comfort&quot; from phone interviews. Don&#x27;t work for companies that do that.<p>* Never interview a candidate with more than one interviewer. Interviews are incredibly hostile experiences in the best of circumstances. Ganging up on candidates ensures that you can&#x27;t possibly be in the best circumstance.<p>* Have lunch with candidates if you like, but don&#x27;t make lunch a Q&A with the candidate. Train your team not to treat it that way. Be clear with the candidate when the metaphorical &quot;red indicator light&quot; goes on to say that they&#x27;re being assessed, and when the light goes off so they can regroup. Assume even the most clueful and experienced candidate will need routine opportunities to regroup.<p>* Do not allow team members to contribute feedback based on &quot;culture fit&quot;. Set aside that &quot;culture fit&quot; is often as not a fig leaf for a variety of discriminatory practices: it&#x27;s also bad engineering. &quot;Culture fit&quot; allows any engineer to discard all the data you painstakingly collect on a candidate based solely on non-falsifiable gut-feeling assertions.<p>* Script your interviews. Your engineers will hate hate hate hate hate you for doing this (trust me, even if they start off thinking it&#x27;s a good idea, they&#x27;ll stop thinking that after they&#x27;ve done two of them), but you&#x27;ll start generating actual data based on your candidates so you can make apples-apples comparisons and <i>optimize</i> your interviews instead of just occasionally changing the color of the rubber chicken you&#x27;re waving around at candidates. Scripted interviews are also a forcing function for the development of objective standards for hiring, which will keep your team honest.<p>When I was at Matasano, we got minimal value out of campus interviewing, but a lot of value out of Internet outreach.<p>Things that make well-engineered interview processes tend to have a side effect of minimizing bias. The reason is that subconscious biases are already the biggest source of noise in your screening process anyways, so improving your screening will tend to require you to minimize bias.",1418941701

The actual magic, from my perspective, is social skills and the ability to organize/manipulate people.<p>People like magic narratives because magic acts as a force multiplier for a single person. The force multiplier in real life is the ability to organize a bunch of other people to do stuff for you. The real Merlin is Steve Jobs or Obama. Just like magic, the ability to do this is generally an inborn talent (theoretically it could be learned, but you can&#x27;t do anything to change whether it&#x27;s the kind of thing you like to do, just like you can&#x27;t do anything to make yourself like golf enough to make yourself practice as much as Tiger Woods).<p>There are weaknesses to this comparison, of course. In real life when you are using social engineering to further your goals, you become beholden to the network of interests that support you (e.g. politicians, customers). Also, in real life the ability to gain positions of influence is not distributed in any egalitarian manner.<p>One of the reasons magic is appealing to programmer types, is because they tend to be weaker in these areas, and they wish that they could have access to the same sort of power, but based on the things they are good at (studying tomes, complex incantations) rather than the things they aren&#x27;t good at (networking, salesmanship).

Sure there are things like RAC that promise to make it just work, but those don&#x27;t scale more than a few nodes.<p>Mongo is kind of the worst in this - it clusters in one weird way, has bad tooling, and subtly destroys your data at scale.<p>The general philosophy with postgres is to do it right, or not do it.  There are ways to do specific kinds of clustering, but all of them (just like mongo, oracle, etc) have a lot of nuances to them.<p>If you have a natural shard key, use a bunch of schemas and table inheritance, and eat the downtime during re-shards.

Weight is an issue, but so is volume.

This means less material in a lot of situations.<p>* I presume (if there isn&#x27;t now) there will be &quot;rough&quot; launches to carry bulk materials, and &quot;gentle&quot; launches for delicate things and people. If there is a way to do &quot;rough launches&quot; cheaper, (higher g, higher vibration, more risk since there aren&#x27;t humans or super expensive equipment on board) then you can provide more space on the &quot;gentle&quot; launches for the the delicate equipment.

My name is Alequo Adarys  and I have the pleasure of being the owner of the House of Chance.<p>Located in Fleabottom, in the dinghy heart of King&#x27;s Landing, the House of Chance has created a unique game combining both luck and knowledge. The first-of-its-kind game allows a player to achieve an astonishing 1% edge in their favor, with knowlegeable play. Built into the legendary Iron Throne of Aegon the Conqueror, the game is a slot machine where the slots represent the 9 great Houses of Westeros. Players at the House of Chance first choose which of the great Houses they belong to, and when a winning sequence of patterns includes their house, the player will be awarded a &quot;House Bonus&quot; payout on top of their normal winning payout. But the payout does not stop there. After a &quot;House Bonus&quot; the player will be presented with a question about the history and lore of Westeros, allowing them to win an even bigger &quot;Question Bonus&quot; payout. Questions range from easy to very hard and their difficulty depends on the type of patterns the player spun in the slot machine. An example question is shown below:<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/k6t8mkt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/k6t8mkt</a><p>Notice that questions are in multiple choice format and that there is a timer which gives the player a limited amount of time to answer the question. The timer ensures that players with the knowledge of Maester will be able to answer the question, but those who wish to search the scrolls of the Citadel in search of the answer will not have enough time. The questions come from the largest online collection of Game of Thrones trivia. Players at the House of Chance may also contribute to the collection of trivia by creating their own questions. Any questions created by a player that are accepted into the collection of trivia will result in a &quot;question bounty&quot; of 1000 gold Dragons (the currency of Westeros) to the player who submitted it. Gold dragons may be converted to and from bitcoins at a rate of 1 bitcoin = 1 million gold Dragons. A player will also be acknowledged for creating a question whenever it is shown to other players in the House of Chance who obtain a House Bonus while playing the game.<p>With knowledgeable play, a player at the House of Chance can have an edge as high as 1% in their favor - so in the long term they should be able to beat the House. The more you know about Game of Thrones, the better you will be able to do. Fans of Game of Thrones will find that there is no other place in Westeros where wagering is more in their favor than at the House of Chance.<p>The game provides many great features, including:<p>Variable House edge, up to 1% in the player&#x27;s favor\nLargest collection of Game of Thrones trivia on the web\nThe more you know about Game of Thrones, the better your odds\nFaucet feature: ability to create trivia for the site and be rewarded with 1000 gold Dragons (instantly convertible to btc) for each question you create that&#x27;s accepted.

It&#x27;s taking a long time, so some joker published a web page that lists all the other members of our site, who have already shipped Conway&#x27;s Life implementations.<p>So I pointed out that I shipped my own Life game for the Classic Mac OS in 1997, and that it was particularly fast because it set the bit-depth of the screen to 1 (black and white, no color, no greyscale), then drew directly into the video card memory.  My old website where I published its source has been available in the wayback machine this whole time.<p>The response?  Two other people pointed out that they knew how to draw directly to the screen decades ago.<p>No one is willing to acknowledge that I shipped my own Life implementation fourteen years ago, long before that site even existed.",1418940079

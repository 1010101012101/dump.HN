That counts as famous.<p>Doctorow is a ""clear thinker"" if you're fine with his oversimplifying matters and making a lot of assumptions about things that he shouldn't be making. He's a bit too bloodthirsty about killing copyright: he seems all-too-willing to abandon all traditions just because things are changing. I don't think that ""get rid of everything"" is at all a measured response to the issues at hand. Similarly, whenever he talks about art I want to jab a fork between my eyes. The guy doesn't know what he's talking about. He knows <i>less</i> about what he's talking about than <i>I</i> do on the same issues, and I'm not particularly well-versed in the subject.<p>His fiction is terrible.

Just as we consider early humans to have ""evolved"" the ability to use crude tools, we have ""evolved"" the ability to use penicillin, brain surgery, etc.<p>""Survival of the fittest"" is a useless tautology. An organism's evolutionary fitness, if there were such a thing, would be its ability to survive to reproductive age. So of course the fittest survive, we've defined fitness to mean survival.<p>In reality it's the species that has an evolutionary fitness; and the distinction is important. Take a bee colony for example, a huge number of the bees are infertile.<p>To address your example: infertility treatments may catalyze an evolutionary process of selecting against those who are disinterested in child rearing. Or, like the bee colony, infertility in some members of the species may be evolutionarily advantageous; hard to imagine, but not without precedent.",1238096880

It has become the hammer that's turning everything into a nail. It's led to a pretty ugly state of software in a lot of different arenas, because a CBA doesn't support spending much time running down memory leaks, or trying to reduce software footprint.<p>The problem with using CBA in software -- and more to the point, in the environment -- is that it ignores the cumulative effect of lots of small decisions. Each individual action may not make ""rational"" sense in terms of CBA, but the consequences quickly add up.<p>To go back to my specific example, you're right that our hauling out some of the trash probably had very little positive impact on our environment. However, it is the cumulative actions of us and others like us who ensure that our trails stay clean.<p>For yet another example, if you climb Mount Rainier in Washington, you are expected to pack out <i>all</i> of your waste. I would guess the average trip time to the summit and back to be about three to four days, so that means that parties must carry their poop in their pack.<p>From an individual cost-benefit point of view, that's ridiculous and not rational. It requires a lot of effort for -- on an individual basis -- little environmental benefit.<p>However, it's the <i>cumulative</i> impact of thousands of summit parties every year that has a very real, and very detrimental, impact on the mountain's ecology.<p>Basically, cost-benefit analysis is a stupid, shortsighted way to make decisions.",1238095891

I'm going to school while running my own company (read working 12-16 hours a day), attending business and tech events, speaking, and trying to spend time with my family. My experience with the MBA program I am in is that it has made me a better business person from the standpoint of knowing what to look at and measure with my business. I didn't understand nor pay attention to any of that the first go round and the company did horribly. Having said that, anyone that comes out of business school expecting to know everything, and acting like it, is sorely mistaken. That's not how anything in the real world works.

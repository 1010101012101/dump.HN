People are afraid of knives, guns and especially bombs.<p>Two people are almost guaranteed to take down one man with a knife, because at worst one of the two will be stabbed if you rush the guy. At best the knife is handled and the two people tackle the guy.<p>Furthermore a box cutter isn't very dangerous. I use one daily at work, the blades are very weak (especially the x-acto style) and cannot be used fully extended or any sideways pressure would snap it (IE grab for the blade and twist your hand, or just try side swiping the blade and it would likely brake to no more than a 1/2"" of protruding blade). Rigid blade box cutters (IE Stanley Knife) rarely protrude beyond 1"" to 1.5"". This still likely sounds very scary to 90% of people, you're still being cut by a knife. However, you're being cut by a knife that's as thin as a scalpel - IE any first aid kit can easily fix a soft-tissue injury if you got stabbed in the torso. For these blades to slash properly, you'd likely get less than a 1/4-1/2"" of actual penetration. It would hurt in the aftermath but wouldn't likely cause enough harm to stop you as an initial attack.<p>The best way to handle a person with a box cutter would likely to be a full-on body-check. If he's in the aisle, he either confronts or runs as there's not enough room for him to dodge you. If he runs, you carry on with the plan and tackle him to the ground. If he confronts you, make sure you jump for the impact. If he stabs you, you'll both still be going to the ground.<p>When there's a bomb on the plane, you've got nothing to lose by not trying. If someone's got a gun, again, it's simply tackle them. However, a dead-rush won't likely help unless you have kevlar handy so would require a bit more finesse.

I wish I had time to neatly categorize posts based on the content in the post but in general, a few themes standout: (1) sagely start-up wisdom (2) another day, another web application (3) another day, another debate about the best MVC framework for the web app (4) VC gossip (5) gossip around Apple, Google and Facebook (6) Another post about how language X sucks, a contrarian spinning his/her wheels on why language Y rocks. That pretty much sums up hacker news. The Signal/Crap ratio is scary if you rip apart fluff masquerading as technology.<p>Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the site. What bothers me is this penchant to appropriate the ""start-up"" cool as opposed to focusing on the idea, product, or service that is being innovated -- as if a start-up is the end-all-be-all in life. Is start-up association the technology community parallel to celebrities who are famous for being famous? That brings us to another abused word namely, ""innovation."" Since when did 100 lines of web application code become innovation? Where is the innovation that focuses on the hard problems? I am not sure if there can be a scale for innovation but a 100 line web 2.0 application is no match for the integrated circuit. I am sorry, I cannot put these two in the same league. As a developer myself, I can tell you, code is just code. Pasting code on blogs and sites is just show-off; much like the friendly sales guy in a suit who is flashing the latest smartphone at the airport to appropriate the phone's coolness.<p>What seems to be also missing is the appreciation for incremental and painstaking detail oriented innovation.

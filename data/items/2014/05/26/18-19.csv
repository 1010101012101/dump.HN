7801036,comment,7800871,7800871,0,0,marketforlemmas,,,"These are interesting examples of using game theory to model certain situations but none of these examples show that game theory &quot;tells us&quot; something about the world. In broad strokes, game theory claims to have a descriptive model of human behavior but people very rarely follow the predictions of game theory (and that is even when you&#x27;re in situations that are simple enough to have a stab at applying game theory). This is particularly true for Nash Equilibrium, which it seems most of your examples rely on.<p>And I think in the cases where the NE are predictive of actual play, then there&#x27;s something intuitively obvious about the NE, and that you could have arrived at the same conclusions without using the tools and machinery of game theory. This is the point that Ariel Rubenstein makes (<a href=""http://arielrubinstein.tau.ac.il/papers/74.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arielrubinstein.tau.ac.il/papers/74.pdf</a>) when he says that game theory is useless.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that I believe that game theory is never useful (for certain limited settings, like repeated auctions, it works well), nor do I think that it can never be useful (recent work in behavioral game theory is promising in my opinion) but I&#x27;m skeptical using these counterintuitive claims as examples of its use.",1401130786
7801035,comment,7799807,7799807,9,0,Jormundir,,,"After brewing on this for longer, I think I have a better perspective than my initial posting.<p>Monitoring student behavior, engagement, studying techniques, etc., is going to be very important for improving our education system. We need more quantitative data to be able to adjust the system based on what&#x27;s working and what&#x27;s not. However, monitoring students gives schools the tools they need to force students to behave the way they want, and punish when they don&#x27;t. This is where the program described in the article crosses the line. Student behavior is being policed in order to corral them into a narrowly defined &quot;acceptable&quot; behavior. This is why it&#x27;s going to be extremely important for monitoring to happen transparently, and for these monitoring programs to be very open to scrutiny, and we should all rightly shun a program and especially its implementors for crossing the line into policing.<p>That being said, lets be careful about over-punishing the practice of monitoring, as it is the best tool we have today for meaningfully improving education. I&#x27;m very excited about the new advances in ed tech, almost all of which include monitoring, and I really don&#x27;t want them to be slowed or stopped because we as a community overreacted to the concept as a whole, rather than focusing on the misuse of the data collected from monitoring.",1401130769

7801020,comment,7800752,7800833,17,0,msandford,,,"How much does a pallet cost to manufacture and how much does a lo-jack cost to implant?  Further, how much does it cost to keep the lo-jack running for a decade?<p>I used to run a 10,000 sqft logistics facility (really tiny in that world) and we kept a stock of about 20 pallets.  I seem to remember the wooden ones costing $2-$5  used and the plastic ones less than $50 new.  The most expensive pallets I could find from U-Line are $100 or so.  <a href=""http://www.uline.com/BL_8204/Rackable-Pallets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uline.com/BL_8204/Rackable-Pallets</a><p>Figure that adding an armored place to put a lo-jack would cost $5-$10 (gotta protect it) and that the actual lo-jack would cost at least $50.  It would need to be metal encased with a way to sneak an antenna out, have a &quot;lifetime&quot; battery (lithium-thionyl-chloride, not cheap <a href=""http://www.all-battery.com/lithiumprimarybatteries.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.all-battery.com/lithiumprimarybatteries.aspx</a>) and the whole thing would have to be molded in to the pallet lest someone get clever and remove them cheaply.  The batteries MUST be an integral part of the lo-jack so that someone couldn&#x27;t just remove the batteries and neuter the device.<p>Then the data plan to keep it connected up to the world via the internet would cost at least a buck or two every month (in HUGE bulk purchases, individually it&#x27;s something like $10/mo/device).  Worse is that if someone puts them inside a metal building or metal shipping container or metal truck they&#x27;re going to have a hell of a time getting a GPS fix and/or communicating with the cellular network.<p>So now that you&#x27;ve done all this your $40 to $100 (max) pallet now costs at least $50 and perhaps even $100 more PLUS it costs you something monthly whether people are renting it or not.  What do you get to charge for this?  From when I can tell, about $5 per trip.  <a href=""http://www.palletforum.com/tm.asp?m=26458"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.palletforum.com/tm.asp?m=26458</a>  That&#x27;s on a nominal $20 pallet cost although they may cost more now, the forum post is 2 years old.<p>I can&#x27;t see how building a lo-jack into a pallet is going to be a compelling value proposition given all the limitations.",1401130558

7801008,comment,7799687,7800942,2,0,rrrx3,,,"Scrolling has long been established as a transient action. It makes total sense to submerge the menu until such time as it&#x27;s needed. This pattern is prevalent in plenty of mobile apps. Google Chrome on iOS is a shining example. Safari, as well.<p>You can make a reasonable assumption that users scrolling down are reading content, and thusly have no need for the menu bar. What I&#x27;m seeing from your perspective is that you&#x27;re failing to recognize that &quot;losing your place&quot; in order to reveal the menu is a complete change of task. By bringing back the menu, or even using it if it were in place statically, your task and intent has shifted. If you&#x27;ve decided to abort your menu task and revert to reading content, it provides less cognitive friction to let the user scroll themselves back to their original place.<p>My question to you is - what logical sense does it make to stop reading an article midway through and begin interacting with the menu, unless your intent is to navigate away from the content itself? And if it makes sense to you to do this, why do you find yourself changing and aborting tasks so swiftly? Are there other interactions that you&#x27;ve failed to discover that might be beneficial (tap and hold to get a menu, for example)?<p>TL;DR - you&#x27;re bitching about an edge case.",1401130462

You just have to look at the thousands of commits, and change lists.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;ll have to disagree with your disagreement. Thousands of commits doesn&#x27;t mean it is worth breaking backwards compatibility. Unicode support? Yeah it is nice. But it worked fine for me before. Print is a function. Again, pretty nice, not nice enough to break backwards compatibility.<p>> Python 3.4 has generic functions to do single dispatch matching on type.<p>Ok. Never really needed that in Python. So again not worth breaking backwards compatibility.<p>> There is the new asyncio library for really elegant async,<p>That is a bad idea. Promises and futures are not a very good concurrency construct. Light threads, processes and message passing are better. Twisted has been around for ages, and even though it is used here and there it hasn&#x27;t exactly taken the world by storm yet. So I certainly don&#x27;t see it as a positive, rather it is a negative. I would rather they adopted greenlet and supported gevent better or integrated PyPy&#x27;s STM<p>> We have CFFI for simpler FFI.<p>Ok, I just used CFFI in Python 2 last week, worked great.<p>> Lambdas are kept simple for readability, as functions are preferred.<p>Heavy lambda usage is not that good of a practice in Python. And Python 2 has lambdas as well. It use them sparingly.<p>> I&#x27;m just going to stop here..<p>Oh no, please don&#x27;t stop, because you haven&#x27;t convinced many people Python 3 is better.<p>>  You can statically type check python now (see pysonar2, pylint, and pycharm for example)<p>You know what has better static type checking? Go.  I am sitting down looking at static type checking and fixing code for backward compatibility, I will also be evaluating other languages and platforms.<p>Python 3 is not bad. But is is not that much better than Python 2. Sorry. A lot of that is not Python 3&#x27;s fault as much as a testament to how good Python 2 already was.<p>I think Python 3 should have offered a lot more than unicode and print as a function.

Of <i>course</i> this will not work if it is used incorrectly. Why would you expect any different? However, the same can be said for normal course work. What if the teacher gets the students to read only the first word of each sentence? This shows books will never work, and lecturing is the only way to teach.<p>Putting that aside, the point is that as you say, there are many ways to learn a topic. Asking children how they best learn things is not going to get useful answers most of the time, but analysis of reading and research patterns using sophisticated data mining or ML software will allow teachers to segment their students into groups that all learn in a similar way. So everyone benefits.<p>As I suggest above, I&#x27;d go further than instrumenting the ebooks. If they are on a tablet device using the Internet, then instrument the browser too, and you can correlate Wikipedia and Google searches with whatever page of the textbook they were on, and see what topics are unclear and always need additional research. You would also find out which students are deeply interested in the topic, as they read on past the end of the assignment, and download extra information or search for related topics. And you can discipline those who never open the book a all, and spend all their time looking at amusing cat pictures.<p>With such power there is also a responsibility to manage the student&#x27;s privacy appropriately, bout with a school-provided device, similar to a work laptop, they should have no expectation of absolute privacy anyway. I think any worries about monitoring pale into insignificance against the powerful augmented learning regimes that can be created, and a suitable auditing and management routine will prevent any abuse.",1401128290

After all, collecting these stray pallets takes a lot of labor, a lot of miles, and a lot of trucks. If you are CHEP, why do this work yourself if you can get someone else to do it for you, at a price that you dictate?<p>> In 2008, a group of recyclers filed a class action lawsuit, claiming that CHEP was leveraging its dominant market position, and violating anti-trust law, by transferring its operational costs onto recyclers. The recyclers argued that CHEP had made them into a “conscripted collection army.”",1401128160

Just looking around me at the company-produced products I&#x27;m currently using : Apple, Google, Microsoft, IKEA, Black & Decker, Walmart...<p>You&#x27;re probably dealing with a lot of confirmation bias.<p>If not, you&#x27;re probably going to pull statistical data regarding the dot com bust. Failed companies during the dot com bust were <i>a lot</i> different than Snapchat. They had no users and were funded by clueless empty suits who thought that business success was the combination of a half-assed idea you thought up during dinner and waaay too many code monkeys working on your terrible idea with a forced deadline.<p>That&#x27;s not what Snapchat is. Large amounts of funding from very respected investors with high success rates of investment in companies with a lot of users ... show high correlation with success.<p>Snapchat has a shit ton of users, runs pretty lean cost-wise (low amt of employees, small offices, efficient database/server management, etc.) as <i>any</i> tech company worth a shit these days will run (compared to dot coom bust, that is), continuously rolls out updates and features, and has a lot of funding. All of these <i>very</i> important factors when discussing a company&#x27;s success.<p>For every example of a company that has failed with 1. had a shit ton of users, 2. didn&#x27;t blow it&#x27;s money on stupid shit like Aeron chairs and way too many employees (as companies during the dot com bust did), 3. has rapid development, and 4. has a lot of funding, there are 1000 companies that has succeeded like that. That&#x27;s because those things are pretty good determinants of success.<p>User data is the current currency in Silicon Valley.<p>When you can&#x27;t charge users for GET requests and everyone in the nation is too reluctant to spend a penny on iOS apps, the only real source of income for companies that focus on web/mobile markets is advertisement. So you work on optimizing ROI for advertisement. One way of doing such is optimizing user data analysis. Know your users&#x27; demands better -- their location, their demographic, their interests -- advertise stuff they&#x27;re more likely to click on, get paid more by ad agencies. In order to analyze user data, you need, 1. &quot;analyze&quot; : accurate and thorough aggregation algorithms (I&#x27;m speculating that this is why Google bought Deep Mind and Zuckerberg/Thiel invested in Vicarious), and 2. &quot;user data&quot; : shit tons of raw data regarding your users.<p>And companies with a lot of users have a lot of user data. Even if Snapchat advertises ephemerality, they&#x27;re really storing all of those pics on their database after they&#x27;re deleted client-side (why else would servers even exist, there&#x27;s no reason, technically, something like Snapchat couldn&#x27;t work in pure P2P if you&#x27;re really getting rid of the user data). Not to mention the metadata regarding your phone number and your friends list. While the first bit of advertisement optimization -- &quot;analyze&quot; -- may seem like it&#x27;s not good enough at analyzing pictures and social graphs (your friends and your friends&#x27; friends and your friends&#x27; friends&#x27; friends, and your friends&#x27; friends&#x27; friends that happen to be in your friends and also your friends&#x27; friends, etc.) just yet, 1. this is why AI is becoming so popular, and 2. this is the risk the VC is taking by investing in Snapchat. Obviously every sound investment takes some risk, or else it&#x27;d be so objectively obvious that everyone would make the investment and you wouldn&#x27;t get a high ROI.<p>The risk here is saying &quot;user data in the form of pictures and social graphs, and whatever something like Snapchat can reasonably evolve into if we keep it surviving&quot; is valuable.<p>What you&#x27;re saying when you say &quot;large amounts of funding have historically shown little correlation with success&quot;, you&#x27;re talking about clueless, unexperienced investors saying that &quot;my vague business idea when paired with hundreds of programmers and really expensive Aeron chairs is valuable&quot;.<p>Not only is the former much more believable, given the high success of companies that, 1. initially seemed like useless toys to short-sighted people on the Internet, but had a SHIT TON of users and a very fast development cycle and 2. gone from no-revenue to some-revenue YEARS after initial success, this is also a prediction being made by motherfucking Andressen-Horowitz.<p>So, no, I&#x27;d say cases like Snapchat have HIGH correlation with success.

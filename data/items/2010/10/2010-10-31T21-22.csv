1854421,comment,1853669,1854180,0,0,iko371,,,"I feel you have misframed the issue as well.<p>-In a vacuum, you might be right, but companies in the US increasingly compete on a global scale, and since other countries are more friendly to immigration of skilled professionals, we risk losing our global competitive edge.-<p>That there is a ""global economy"" and that this is somehow a new thing is a myth perpetuated by Milton Friedman's view of the ""flat earth."" What is a new thing is the USA relaxing tariffs and trade restrictions so that American companies can outsource work to other countries and not pay taxes on their goods if they manufacture them abroad. Besides that, there has been a ""global economy"" for many hundreds of years.  It's at least as old as the British empire. What the US has been doing over the last thirty years has not so much been ""opening markets"", as it has been destroying our country's internal regulations that protect American workers from competing with the workers of foreign countries. In my opinion, such regulations were a good thing, and they built the strongest economic power the world had ever seen.<p>In brief, we don't have to compete on global scale if we choose not to. Your statement assumes that we do.<p>-It's a nice idea to think that artificial barriers will result in us ramping up education, but that's a process that will take decades.-<p>USA, 1945: ""It's nice to think that if we eliminate artificial barriers to education, we'll have a skilled workforce that will build America into an industrial and economic superpower, but it would be easier to keep all the money in the hands of a few wealthy people. It would take decades to accomplish being an economic superpower, so it's really not worth the effort."" I'm glad this wasn't the prevailing attitude then. I'm sure the country I live in would look a lot different.<p>-You can't just start teaching advanced computer science to high school seniors who can barely read and struggle with basic math.-<p>Again, reframing. The correct question is, ""Why are so many American high school seniors barely able to read and struggle with basic math?"" There are many facets to this problem, I'm sure, but I think a large chunk of the problem is that for many American families, there is a culture of anti-intellectualism. School, teachers and education are derided, and with this derision comes an unspoken message that being educated is not that important. And it's not just families.  Our culture as a whole doesn't value education. Even in the tech industry, we have superstars Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg as the problem's biggest contributors -- they are both college drop outs, yet they are both ridiculously rich and famous.<p>I think that we could undercut this whole sociocultural phenomenon by having our government step in and do something really drastic, like waive the student loans of anyone who gets a tech degree and holds a job in the industry for some number of years. The more ridiculous the price of an education becomes, the more American teenagers you're going to have who feel that the path of least resistance to a good life doesn't lead through a university.<p>-So what's more likely is that the lack of skilled professionals in this country will gradually reduce our pace of innovation relative to other countries and cause a relative decline in our wealth, causing us to fall further and further behind.-<p>-It's far faster and more efficient to let the hoards of skilled professionals in other countries come here, especially since many of them are willing to risk almost anything to move their families here and would stay forever if we let them.-<p>The assumption made here is that we simply don't have enough skilled labor in this country to meet our demand, and that the only way meet it is to import that skilled labor. I disagree with you. I think we can easily create a social and economic environment conducive to creating the demand we need. Is importing it easier and cheaper? Yes. But it doesn't pay out in the long term.<p>Here's an example situation. Let's stay Startup X has one American engineer, but it needs fifteen more of him. For the sake of argument, let's say his skill set is utterly unique in the US. No one knows what he knows but him. So, Startup X needs fourteen more of him, but they don't exist in this country now. There do exist internationals with the skill set, and it would be really cheap to get the internationals to come over, and Startup X would have all the labor it needs within a matter of weeks. Cheap labor, lots of profit. The CEO is seeing dollar signs. But, his partner points out something else. They've got the one American engineer. The government just recently instituted a bunch of economic incentives for students who get tech degrees. Under the same bill, Startup X could also get money to pay the salaries of interns learning a skilled technology trade. Bingo! Their one American engineer could train the new engineers. Each of them might further innovate, have new ideas, form his own startup one day, and they'd be American startups. Yeah, it'll take longer. And, you might not be able to pay them the same as internationals. Since they're American, they're likely to have higher standards for pay. Oh, but right, I forgot. Using international labor is cheaper and faster, our country be damned.<p>Again, this kind of tunnel vision is really damaging to our industry, because all of the negative societal consequences of conservative economics come back around to bite us in the ass. If we keep addressing our problems with the same kind of thinking that caused the problems in the first place (lower taxes, fewer trade restrictions, etc.), we'll be perpetuating a vicious and dangerous downward spiral.",1288561352

We also have Netflix.<p>We are also serial Pay Per View watchers, but now that $5/movie is going to either Playstation Network or Xbox Live/Zune, depending on which TV we want to watch it on, for about the same price. We have also been known on occasion to pay for TV series on iTunes (such as Tudors) that aren't available anywhere else.<p>For sports, we have ESPN3, which is also coming to Xbox Live shortly.<p>We are a 2 income household making a 6-figure income, so it is most decidedly not that we can't afford it -- it is simply that we got tired of paying for something so worthless.<p>What would get us to come back? Reasonable, a la carte channel ordering. I would, for example, shell out $2 or $3 per month for Bravo and a half dozen other stations that feature content we actually watched. But we had 300 channels and I didn't watch 297 of them -- why should I pay for them?<p>Also, I've never understood why everything isn't just available on-demand (like Hulu). If I have access to Bravo, I should be able to see any already-shown episode of Top Chef that I want, without having ""recorded"" it -- that should just be part of the subscription.

This is a severe tilt in balance between the power of the people and the power of the state. A tilt, to emphasize, that is unfavourable to the people.<p>In Smith v. City of Artesia, 1989, the court said, ""Privacy is inherently personal. The right to privacy recognises the sovereignty of the individual."" What is more private than our private parts? What can the general public be subjected to, en masse, that is more personally invasive than a pat-down or nude photo?<p>Bluntly, the choice is: allow an anonymous agent to take nude photographs of your child, or let strangers grope your child until their hands meet ""resistance"": a euphemistic way to say, ""touch their testicles, penis, or vulva.""<p>Any security measure that forces someone to feel a child's crotch so as to encourage parents to usher their children through a machine that takes nude photographs--without probable cause of having committed a crime--is a measure that aught not to exist.<p>Violations of our private areas must be countered with outrage and utmost resistance against corporations and governments alike. The TSA are not police and North America has no Police States, yet.<p>Add to this the uncertain health risks.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.

I think merely appreciating any moment in time can create true wealth.<p>However, I think us humans are builders and creators. We like to make new things, and coincidentally, everyone I know who is happy creates things. So no, I don't think you can be static, sitting on a pile of cash doing nothing, and still feel ""wealthy"".<p>...But I may have something wrong with me. Or I just might not have met that numeral that truly makes me feel wealthy. But then again, I am very skeptical of the power of money to make me feel wealthy. I just like to use it as an (inefficient) measuring stick.",1288559085

I think in American society when we think of wealth we think of Wall St Bankers with multimillion dollar penthouses in NY, or we think of Ellison and his yachting, but I think we can boil it down to time and choice.<p>Ellison can <i>choose</i> to pursue yacthing as a passion because he is wealthy, and the expense of that hobby is not a determining factor.<p>Gates can choose to spend his energies at philanthropy because the lack of income and time constraints associated with that endeavor are not determining factors.<p>For me, wealth would be 'the ability to follow curiosities and interests, whatever they may be.'  If I have a 9-5 job AND trying to get a startup off the ground AND I have a family with young children, I am able to follow some of my passions, but not all of them, because there are large chunks of my time that I dont control.",1288559049

Earlier today I was sat in my in-laws back yard and I'm guessing I was staring at a coffee cup, but I was working out a part of my story in my head. I had character associations messed up, and in about 5-minutes of being zoned I sorted a bunch of it out.<p>I think she said something along the lines of ""you just had such an evil look, what was you staring at?"" I didn't know I was staring, because to be honest my concentration had receded from the visual. Similarly when I write I can completely zone out audibly to the point I get pissed off and people around me can, because I'll have a playlist going and I miss my favorite song so I'll skip back to play through it again and I'll zone out and miss it. I think in one day I put the play-count of a dozen songs up by like 5 points on iTunes via this.<p>I think 'crazy eyes' is when you zone out visually, and I guess 'crazy ears' is when you zone out audibly. It's like there's a lack of processing power in the brain and its CtrlAltDel'ing a wasted function.",1288558834

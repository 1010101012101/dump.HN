If rates were to rise, both would be (relatively) equally affected. The difference would be that the price of the bond would revert to the face value of the bond as it got closer to maturity.<p>Obviously the downside of this is that you are basically keeping your principal value at the end of the day, but you&#x27;re forced to hold a bond that&#x27;s giving you a below market return until it matures. For most people, this makes absolutely no sense.<p>On top of that, you can buy and sell a mutual fund based on the asset value of the fund at any time, while the bond market is opaque and you often get pricing that is very far off the average unless you are a large institutional buyer/seller. There are massive economies of scale in bonds that you don&#x27;t see in the stock market.<p>If you are trying to invest millions of dollars, buying individual bonds might make more sense, but at that point you&#x27;re going to want someone to help you determine the difference between individual bonds and the covenants that one bond has over another, but even then you still run the risk of getting bad pricing on buying those bonds.",1433429054

What I can say anecdotally is that there are two main issues at play for those who are obese:<p>1. Food is too damn good. We&#x27;ve developed food to be tastier and tastier, setting off more and more pleasure sensations, almost to the point where it loops back around and becomes disgusting.<p>2. Some people under stress do not eat. Other people under stress eat more. People who eat more when stressed will gain weight, and become more stressed about their weight gain.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the morbidly obese here, not just people about twenty pounds overweight.<p>What I did for myself was to make a few adjustments:<p>1. Eat healthier versions of food that I actually like. I mean, sure, a fried chicken sandwich or a hamburger can be delicious. But so is a turkey sandwich, or grilled chicken. When I lost weight, I chose the lower calorie options that I still enjoyed.<p>2. Avoid pointless food. French fries are great, but they&#x27;re just filler. Soda is tasty (though I actually dislike it now that I&#x27;ve had distance from it), but it&#x27;s not substantively adding to my enjoyment of a meal. Stop focusing on sides and enjoy the main course on its own.<p>3. Exercise reasonably and consistently. It&#x27;s not sustainable to go from sedentary obesity to daily hill sprints. Start with walking more, move on to exercise twice a week. Progressively build up from there. Find something you can enjoy doing (for me, I enjoy lifting weights).<p>There&#x27;s a lot more I could talk about (e.g. better sleep, realistic expectations, tolerating hunger) as well.

You cannot conflate poor grades and cheating. The article intentionally misleads by just listing % for all reasons that Chinese student are expelled and then hints (without outright saying) the reason must be cheating, it couldn&#x27;t be for example poor English skills? Or a ton of other problems international students might have (e.g. cultural adaption)?<p>I don&#x27;t know if Chinese students cheat more (I don&#x27;t have that data, and the article doesn&#x27;t supply it). But I do know that Americans spend a lot of time writing anti-Chinese stuff and it is getting pretty pathetic.",1433428384

Lets assume he was a real person for a moment, not magical, maybe a little insane and full of revolutionary ideas. Perhaps the people of his time would never accept his version of the world, a peaceful one, simply because it might cause them a loss of station or because &#x27;that&#x27;s the way we always did it&#x27; or because &#x27;the old gods said it was ok&#x27;. What did he do, he sold them a story. It wasn&#x27;t true and he probably knew it, he told them to love one another, he told them to help those who were the most vulnerable. He created a meme. Everyone creates memes. That &#x27;fact&#x27; you parrot off facebook, you just infected someone else with a meme. So in my eyes the only point to life is this, leave the world in a better place then you found it. Choose the memes you spread wisely, and try to create better ones yourself.<p>Where do I focus my memes? The millions dead and dying from malnutrition. Its absolutely preventable, we have the technology to solve it and its abhorrent that it continues into the modern era. You can join me, or you can pick something else.

But liquidity risk (especially in the corporate bond market) isn&#x27;t exactly news to anybody.<p>Liquidity for US Treasuries may well be lower because the Fed&#x27;s taken so many of them onto its balance sheet[1] but I don&#x27;t think that a lack of liquidity is going to pose a real problem in that market. There&#x27;s a difference between a market that&#x27;s dislocated (by which I mean that the market price has deviated from the &quot;real&quot; value of the asset) due to a structural problem (like a lack of liquidity), and a market that has reached its peak (and/or is overvalued, and is undergoing a correction - which may be happening in Europe at the moment[2]).<p>People get all excited about flash crashes and talk about billions of dollars being wiped off the value of whatever but it&#x27;s complete horseshit. Just because a few trades happen at an unreasonable price because of a technical hiccup (or because of some strange, unforeseen interaction between different automated systems) doesn&#x27;t mean that the underlying value of the asset in question has changed. If a share starts the day at $100, dips to $1 because of a flash crash, then recovers to $100, what has really changed? A few people may have made/lost money by being lucky/unlucky enough to have traded at an incorrect price (e.g. because a stop-loss got triggered or something) but other than the appearance of an icicle-shaped spike on a chart, it&#x27;s just noise (and if you have a system which reacts to noise, then the problem lies with your system, not the market).<p>Personally, I think the bond market has been propped up by &quot;quantitative easing&quot;, which has, in turn, inflated the equity markets. At some point, that situation has to undergo a correction and that could well manifest itself as a crash if everyone dashes for the exit at the same time.

The probability of 30+% of the IT staff suddenly not working the next day is considered vanishingly low, even in DR contexts where they routinely deal with low probability events.<p>2. Even if (1) was to come about, IT management pretty universally agrees with each other that IT staff are generally replaceable on short notice without irreversible consequences to the organization.<p>The case for organizational <i>data</i> disappearing and causing irreparable harm to the organization is pretty well established and accepted by IT management. It is not at all clear to me that even if an IT union entrenched itself in a major company, that a mass walkout would be taken that seriously, because I haven&#x27;t yet seen the case made and accepted that IT organizational staff disappearing causes the same or greater harm.<p>The corollary implication is that IT organizations commit more process capital to retention of the bits sitting on spinning rust than to staff retention. Staffing spend remains an overwhelming percentage of the annual budget of most IT organizations, and if it isn&#x27;t well-accepted that this staff disappearing all at once causes catastrophic damage, then I can&#x27;t be surprised when there is so much assiduous effort at reducing that spend.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with this mainstream IT management outlook on the matter, but most IT management is constrained to what they can demonstrate in financials and budget spreadsheets to senior management.

If you&#x27;re feeling generous, something to the effect of &quot;I have a medical problem&quot;; don&#x27;t offer to explain because really, anything else is none of their business. Say it with conviction and complete confidence; remember, in your case, you&#x27;re doing them a favor, remember that. If they drop it, good; mission accomplished. If they lack the couth or good sense to spare you your dignity, then there is no reason to spare them theirs. Now is the time to deploy in appropriate detail precisely the reason for your tardiness.

Many &quot;flash crashes&quot; are caused deliberately to do just this, and the risk/reward of trying to game them is not worth it. In many cases, exchanges will roll back or invalidate any orders placed within 5 minutes of the flash crash, so the potential reward is not guaranteed. Any large orders placed immediately after the crash would be looked upon suspiciously.<p>Any company capable of exploiting a flash crash in the way you describe would need to be a timing arbitrage player -- and that&#x27;s not a cheap business to be in. But exploiting short term dips in pricing is exactly what that type of HFT is designed for. It&#x27;s incredibly profitable, but also zero-sum because there are only so many lucrative opportunities.

9659304,comment,9657716,9657716,0,0,nichtich,,,"As someone involved in this I feel obligated to explain some basic mechanics in Chinese IPO. 
1. Unlike in US. The underwriter/issuer doesn&#x27;t decide who get the allocation. Instead it&#x27;s a 2 tier lottery which is purely based on how much you put in and the RNG. This is mainly to stop the perceived &quot;corruption&quot; they think exists in US where a nice relationship with the broker can get you a good allocation in a hot IPO, AND the fact that you can just announce the amount you want to buy without posting any money for that.
2. Because of 1, individual investors treat this as a lottery instead of a popularity contest as in US, so everyone wants in. As a result, to protect the individual investors, the equivalent of SEC of china has an unspoken rule that the IPO company must have a PE ratio below 23(don&#x27;t ask why 23). With current avg PE in 70s range, it looked like a sure win for whoever get the lucky allocation.
3. SO! Whoever get any movable money will be paticipating in this IPO, because you are looking at a risk free 10% -20% annualized return. Point to me one guy who think that&#x27;s not awesome and I&#x27;ll buy him a skii trip in the Alps.<p>So, just imagine Apple went IPO today, and priced at 1/3 of PE as MSFT, AND everybody has the same chance of getting the shares at the IPO price as long as you have the money to backup your order.

3604874,comment,3603712,3604173,7,0,Silhouette,,,"> Using an ES5 shim is best-practice these days<p>Says who?<p>I'm guessing about 90% of the reason most people start using a library like jQuery is because it lets you find almost any DOM element in a single step with a familiar syntax. And about 9% of the rest is probably to make AJAX less painful. Does your unspecified ES5 shim provide these features?<p>If not, a lot of people are going to be using a library like jQuery anyway, and you're advocating using an extra (unspecified) library to get portable utility functions that also work in older browsers. What happened to DRY? ;-)<p>This isn't to say that polyfilling doesn't have its place or isn't useful. I just challenge your claim about what is best practice, because I think the argument is far from compelling in the common case that a developer is already using another library with similar utility functions (which many, many general purpose JS libraries have, because the language itself was so slow to provide them; it's like strings in C++ all over again).",1329510977

They require a server, and getting your IT department to set that up is nontrivial unless you are super tiny.<p>This is completely false in my experience.<p>1) Businesses use wikis all the time. The last 4 places I've worked at have had department wikis. This includes a University, a Mega-Bank, a family owned e-tailer, and a medium-sized consulting firm, which hits just about every size business you can have aside from ""start-up"".<p>2) Getting a wiki set up <i>is</i> trivial. For the large companies you request the IT side to give you a VM and an address on the intranet. For the small companies it's usually a spare box and an address on the intranet. It's dead simple.<p>Also I suspect you would be surprised at how much leeway managers have in choosing collaboration mediums. Email is the old standby, yes, but many managers will choose other ways to collaborate within their department. Most businesses have an IM server for internal chats as well.",1329509141

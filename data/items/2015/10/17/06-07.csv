10403636,comment,10403242,10403242,0,0,brianclements,,,"What I find incredibly interesting about the Uber story is that it seems to be a sped up history of the relationship between workers, unions, and customers in the market place. At first Uber drivers jumped at the chance to make &quot;extra cash&quot;, not a career, out of their work. Then, somewhere (what do you think was the turning point?) this transformed into a viable job alternative. The workers wanted more pay, and thus, rights. We then have the current legal discussion regarding their independent contractor status. Now, we have them wanting raises in pay and the ability to get tips. I don&#x27;t see how that cost won&#x27;t be passed down to consumers. But somehow this picture transformed from &quot;extra cash&quot; into a viable job alternative. How do you think that occurred? People have done similar things with selling stuff on ebay, but I don&#x27;t see them unionizing. Is it because it&#x27;s different when it involves human interaction?<p>Side note: If we&#x27;re learning anything about tipping from the minimum wage battles in restaurants, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s probably cheaper for Uber to allow tipping.",1445064886

10403614,comment,10384656,10399832,0,0,zaroth,,,"Sorry I should have clarified, I went with 4160 hours as two parents each working full time (2080 hours x 2), since we&#x27;re talking about a family of 4 and anyway most people cannot and do not gross $100k alone.<p>Unfortunately just because the family is netting after lost benefits and taxes $40k for the work, doesn&#x27;t mean they are &quot;$40k/year better off&quot; for working. For two people to work full time and gross $100k somewhere outside the home, there are substantial direct costs. After you &quot;net&quot; the lost benefits and taxes, you still have to &quot;net&quot; the direct costs. Child care, transportation, and clothing are probably the top 3, food and household costs also tend to increase when working. Many of these direct costs are also not fully tax deductible. Opportunity cost is significant not just in terms of not having to hire service providers to do things you no longer have time to do yourself (e.g. child care, repairs, maintenance), but also in things like personal value-producing activities which are not considered income, e.g. gardening, home improvement, home schooling. You&#x27;re not &quot;better off&quot; if you spend 4160 hours neting $40k of cash, then spend $15k of that on unreimbursed business expense, and could have done more valuable things with your time than $6/hour. So everything works together to lower the net utility dramatically below the alternative of simply not carrying a job, and doing something directly productive to your family with your time.<p>My thesis is that up to about $100k, the true fully realized benefit for a family of 4 with two adults working full time outside the home is significantly less than $10/hour, and in fact for families consuming significant healthcare is actually negative. This is what I mean by &quot;x^3 shaped curve&quot;, and &quot;for a long time working more nets you little to nothing, and then eventually you can pull-out the other side&quot; around $100k for a family of 4. E.g. $6/hour of actual received value is an extremely low bar considering the time and effort required for two people to gross a combined $100k. Compared to if those same two people simply expended the same level of time and effort taking care of their families, their homes, and themselves. If you really do the math and consider the economic value transferred, while the overall economy certainly benefits from all this money swirling around, and taxpayers benefit from decreased social welfare expense, the individual family will see very little gain (i.e. increase in assets or disposable income) if not a loss at the end of the year, after having devoted the majority of their waking life that year to their job.<p>While historically the workforce participation rate has grown, it has recently been shrinking, and I personally think we will see it continue to shrink for some time, in part due to this almost complete futility of low to middle-class earning power. The only things saving the economy from a mass exodus from these jobs is; first this was only just recently made quite as bad as it is through the ACA Medicaid and SNAP expansion. By giving $5000 of Whole Foods vouchers, and best-in-the-world free healthcare to all non-workers regardless of assets, this strongly altered the value proposition of working, particularly for chronically ill families. These programs also take quite a bit of time and persistence to get into, but we are seeing a massive expansion of these programs every year. Over time more people catch on, sign up, and drop out of the work force.<p>Means-tested programs are unfortunately not irrelevant. For people in the worst case scenarios (very low assets AND no income), starting to work provides the most damaging effects by immediately canceling benefits, in many cases more than dollar-for-dollar against what is earned. Families who operate in the bottom $40,000 of the curve will almost certainly pass the asset tests, and also face incredibly steep marginal rates (the original point) when you consider these programs, cumulatively they are much worse than 100% marginal. So the people in the absolute worst shape are locked out the hardest from starting to work, because they have $0 assets and literally cannot afford a net loss for adding a new commitment to their day. For example, TANF will pay up to $713/per month in cash, but every dollar in countable gross income reduces the benefit by $1. So if you qualify for TANF then TANF <i>alone</i> produces 100% marginal tax on the first $8772/yr, and then you <i>still</i> need to pay the taxes and direct costs of working! Note that TANF doesn&#x27;t count SNAP/Medicaid/Section 8 as income, Medicaid doesn&#x27;t count SSI, etc.// so the 5 programs are largely (not entirely) stackable by design as long as you strictly avoid other earned income.<p>A second dimension, but I would say a much less pressing problem, is means-testing on its face seems fairly strict (e.g. < $2,500 cash balance in a bank account) but many assets (like your primary residence, your first car, and personal property like jewelry) and some forms of income are also excluded. So in practice it&#x27;s possible to qualify for the program with substantial non-liquid assets, as long as countable income and cash is tightly controlled.<p>I do really appreciate your comments, I&#x27;m sorry if I wrote way too much here!",1445064261

I don&#x27;t like that he backed down so quickly from his first approach, because of the polls. Isn&#x27;t that what corrupt politicians do? I don&#x27;t like that he is so vague about what he&#x27;s going to do to fix corruption - I get it that it&#x27;s about taking money out of politics, but how do you get there, especially when Congress is seized up?<p>And I want to hear about other issues, too, if he&#x27;s seriously running for president. What about local police corruption, violence, and abuse? What about drone assassinations? What about corporate welfare that socializes risk and privatizes rewards? What about poverty and basic income? What about simplifying the legal system so that justice isn&#x27;t too expensive for most people? What about extra-legal punishment like no-fly lists? What about the goddamn NSA? What about the security theater at the airport we pay for and endure?<p>From the other candidates all we hear about is &quot;the economy&quot;, mid-east terrorism and related problems, immigration, and now and again (against all odds) climate change. From Lessig you just hear about corruption. If you want to impress me as a real Presidential candidate, speak eloquently about the days when the US would never have even considered torturing someone for any reason; when 1984 was a cautionary tale about surveillance, not a manual on how to do it; when we needed to work together to defeat an enemy, we did it, or to achieve a great goal like the moon, we did it, and how we can do it again, but this time we&#x27;re going to End Oil, worldwide. I want to hear about how we can use technology to make government at every level more accountable and more responsive, and I want to hear more about our aspirations. I want to hear that we will recover the first asteroid from the asteroid belt within 20 years. I want to hear that federal funding will be tied to the creation of independent police review panels in every major city. I want to hear that blanket surveillance will be made explicitly illegal.<p>But I don&#x27;t hear hardly any of that, not even from Lessig. Which makes me sad.",1445064255

The extraction is enriched for antibodies.  They are less reliable, because there could also be other antibodies in there.  Even the antibodies that recognize what you&#x27;re looking for could be a population of antibodies, each recognizing a different part (think the blind men and the elephant parable).  Presumably, you have tested that a positive control of what you&#x27;re trying to look for works.<p>A monoclonal is different.  You insult a mouse with a sample of what you&#x27;d like to detect, and then resect the spleen, which contains b-cells, cells that produce the antibody.  You then fuse the b-cells with a special strain of cancer cell that will immortalize the b-cell (these are called &#x27;hybridomas&#x27;).  After sorting one cell to a well, you then test to see if the cells in the well have produced an antibody that detects what you&#x27;re looking for.  Therefore, you can be confident that a monoclonal antibody contains only one antibody, that recognizes only one antigen.<p>You don&#x27;t necessarily know what the antigen is that is recognized (that&#x27;s called the epitope).  The epitope could be, say, a piece of protein on the outside of the fungus or a different piece of protein on the outside of the fungus.

Total comp ends up around $220k. I don&#x27;t see too many startups paying over $150k, so the average employee at an exceptional startup like Square makes around the same if not less than at a big company, even with a decent payout.",1445061769

If you&#x27;re a biotech company whose most likely exit is an aquisition by Pfizer or Roche, you want industry insiders. If you&#x27;re like Theranos, and your business depends on consumer spending at places like Walgreens, you&#x27;re so far out of the normal pharmaceutical and diagnostic industry that all bets are off.<p>Several hundred million for an IPO biotech company on ZERO revenue post dotcom crash is common enough that $9 billion valuation (25 times revenue) is damn good. There are literally thousands, if not tens of thousands, of labs that can run an off site (for the consumer) screening for every one of Theranos&#x27; target markers. The idea that anyone would invest hundreds of millions into a diagnostic company without compelLing secret sauce is troubeling. I don&#x27;t doubt that VC firms make mistakes as silly as the rest of us, but I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt assuming semi-competent due dilligence.<p>That said, no VC firm in their right mind would ever invest in a company like Theranos if it had only a few SKUs. It is practically impossible (with current technology) to come up with a generalized test that identifies anything more precise than &quot;gram negative bacteria.&quot; Either Theranos is a pump and dump scam of epic proportions or they really do have some technological superiority that allows them to convert expensive lab tests into a consumer technology.<p>As far as the other red flags, you&#x27;ll usually find the same intrigue surrounding most successful biotech companies. When your operating at the cutting edge of the most difficult scientific field in the most stringent regulatory environment on the planet, you have to take more shortcuts than usual.",1445061763

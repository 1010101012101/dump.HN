Also to notice is that infinite scroll is entirely client-side, so no Javascript enabled browsers will just get the pagination as normally.<p>RSS, yeah, it needs one.<p>The dropdown moving into view is an experiment, and I'm just testing to see how it goes. My thinking was to scroll the readme into view, and scroll up a bit more to put the next element right under the mouse pointer. So if you try clicking somewhere below the middle of the screen (depending on the size of your screen), you can browse the entire list without using mousewheel or moving your mouse from position, and every readme will scroll to the position you are looking. This is especially helpful if you do a search for something and want to view all of this week's items. But if it turns out to be confusing I'll remove it.<p>Links with target _new and _blank isn't something I like too much, so I leave it to user choice if they want to middle click or normal click, which is what they're used to already.<p>The cart idea is interesting, and has some potential. I think it should be made to watch the repo on your account on github, so it'll probably require you to login with your github credentials. Also something for the future as I'm not ready to do logins yet.<p>The UI needs work.<p>You're probably right about the description as title I'll try that.",1291679171

1977316,comment,1977125,1977125,0,0,contagionhealth,,,"A startup lives in a perpetual state of 'about to fall apart.'<p>Sometimes you just feel it more acutely than others, based on circumstances and how emotionally volatile you are at the time, in addition to other factors like how important the issue is in terms of actual survival (yours, the startups - which are two different issues, although codependent variables).<p>Many more issues surface in your short post.<p>1. You're only 1.5 months in and you've attracted the interest of a prominent angel investor AND your cofounder is meeting his deliverables? That's doing well, not falling apart.<p>2. You're beginning to feel the strain. That is under your control, and only your control. Look at how you're managing yourself and your energy levels instead of just looking at the business and reaching out to potentially inflate other issues into 'startup ending' crises upon which you could then heap blame when you quit.<p>If it seems too tough, that's because it IS.<p>What you have to figure out is whether or not it is too tough for you. Do you want this kind of stress/strain/doubt to surface almost every day for the next 2-7 years?<p>Are you willing to continue to take on this kind of risk?<p>Because that's what your startup will require.<p>Granted, if you're lucky, passionate, and good, and you work your ass off, those will be intermittently interspersed with such blinding moments of success that you'll wonder how you could have possibly considered quitting at any point.<p>3. Your cofounder relationship seems to be a big potential issue for you. I take it your cofounder is perhaps slightly 'more' technical than you - but could be wrong since you don't state this explicitly.<p>His risk tolerance is also lower than yours, it seems, as he's maintaining a 'safety' net with the consulting gig on the side.<p>This can mean many things, but you should perhaps be most worried about this if you're in the CEO/#1 role, as it can indicate a cofounder's lack of trust in your ability to 'drive.'<p>Falling off the map can happen (I've been guilty of it), but it usually means either you're frantically busy trying to sell, raise funds, etc. or that you've got a life on the other side of the startup which would suffer if you left it, and which you're not quite ready to give up.<p>It's your job to find out which is going on with your cofounder, preferably before you accept funding. If he's not committed and leaves after funding, and you're nontechnical, you're in a very tricky spot.<p>You also don't mention the equity split, but if it's 50/50, you've got bigger issues. Maybe the cofounder wants more, maybe he or she thinks she's got 50 % of nothing. If so, it's your job to communicate (and then actually hit deliverables like sales, funding money in the bank, etc) that make the point.<p>4. Who is going to recruit the CTO? Does the angel know 'a few people?' Does he have a specific person in mind? If so, has he named them, shared the name and a few sentences of this person's experience, and said he'd email or call them by X?<p>If not, and assurances are vague at best, he's probably relying on you to find someone.<p>Do not discount the tremendous time, energy, and effort it takes to find this kind of executive as a first time entrepreneur.<p>Given the other issues, it's challenging but not impossible for you to find a CTO at this point in the company history.<p>5. Going solo with the project? When you're fearful of him doing the same? Not a great idea. It's a worse indicator that you don't know if he'd pursue the same project independently.

But it's really only analogous to it, it's not an <i>actual</i> war. Nobody has been killed in this ""war"" yet, and I really don't see a reason to start.<p>Secondly, it would set a bad precedent.

Even in an actual war, we prefer\nto capture rather than to kill unarmed men where possible. If Assange has broken US law then there's a perfectly reasonable set of procedures we can go through in order to put him on trial.<p>Fourthly, it would just be a public relations disaster for the US, in ways that I don't feel the need to explain.<p>In conclusion, Daniel, I know you were being hyperbolic with the kill-Assange thing, but I think you'll agree that under careful consideration of the options that it's probably not the best option.",1291678463

Let's examine a few of the cases point by point as to why the leaks are a terrible thing;<p>Point) Secrets are essential to the functioning of a government, without any secrets nothing could get done.<p>Counterpoint) Wikileaks are not trying to reveal <i>all</i> secrets, if you look at their released documents there are many redacted segments where sensitive names are handed out, for example this one <a href=""http://cablesearch.org/cable/view.php?id=09TELAVIV1098&hl=xxxx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cablesearch.org/cable/view.php?id=09TELAVIV1098&h...</a> . This does not entirely excuse the process in one fell swoop, as there are other instances where they have exposed information with a questionable upside and an apparently heavy downside, but it does indicate that they are at least trying for a harm minimisation process. It is clearly not their purpose to cause as much ""battle damage"" as possible.<p>Further, although some secrets may be necessary to the functioning of governments, this is not a license that they ought to be able to employ secrets to cover up their messy failures that the public needs to know about if they want to be able to punish a surfeit of these or reward an absence of these. Hiding them leads at worst to an assumption that much more is wrong than actually is, and at best to an assumption that everything is rosy when the world is falling apart behind the scenes.<p>Point) They should stand up and take what's coming to them like real men, without this they're just being cowardly.<p>Counterpoint) How does this logic work for North Korea or other edge cases? And if this logic does not work for North Korea or other edge cases, where people would like to have exposure of injustice without opening themselves up for spiteful retribution or the execution of their entire family for not swallowing wholesale evil nonsense, where do you draw the line? If a torrent of information showing government malfeasance is leaked along with a trickle of examples of the actual valid employment of secrecy as a defensive measure, isn't this proof in itself that the ability to maintain secrecy is being abused?<p>It's actually a sliding scale in the leaking model dependent upon the content of the secrets being leaked, the leak process itself is one that somewhat accounts for this. You have a potential authoritarian conspiracy, members to this potential authoritarian conspiracy, and then the personal ethical and moral considerations of these members. When the degree to which a person feels compelled to disclose the nature of these secrets outweighs the degree to which they feel that it is more beneficial to keep these secrets, leaks happen. This is a hedge against deploying secrets to cover the failings and underhandedness of a given authoritarian conspiracy. Without this hedge, administrators of said authoritarian conspiracy have all the motivation in the world to mark their failings secret and none not to.<p>If you were to have had access to this trove of secrets beforehand and you had found that the only instances where secrets were actually employed is when it was clearly being used as a shield to protect lives and property, would you feel compelled to leak it? It looks like in instances where secrecy was validly employed in this method, even wikileaks has attempted to maintain that secrecy. That they haven't been perfectly capable of doing so is certainly partially their fault, but the blame cannot be shifted from the original situation in which secrets were primarily used as a cloak for failure.<p>Point) Ok so if things are really that bad then we should just declare armageddon, armed uprising, down with the tyrants! let the blood run free and fire flood the cities! Rargh, pass me my axe and the skull of the nearest infant that I may swill mead from it!<p>Counterpoint) Why in the event that you deem the current situation to be bad would you want to replace it with rank chaos and barbarism? This just sets an artificial lower limit for the pain of change. If no tactical movement could be made in opposition to the established powers until the alternative was outright armageddon, all this does is guarantee that eventually you will have outright armageddon. The sensible thing to do is obviously to act with foresight and care and attempt to minimise harm as much as possible, weigh your movements against the potential negative consequences of them and proceed on this basis.<p>If the only way to improve is to destroy everything in the established order, not only do we guarantee that eventually everything will be destroyed, but we also limit the current less bad circumstance to a natural plateau. This is not a good thing.<p></warandpeace>",1291678404

Most people seem to be taking a white-or-black stance on this, but I'm stuck somewhere in the gray.<p>Regarding the leaked cables (at least the ones leaked so far), I'm finding it hard to believe that the leak has caused permanent or significant damage of any kind.  Diplomats will have to work overtime to smooth some ruffled feathers, but I haven't seen evidence of a shift for the worse in international relations.<p>If the worst outcome of these leaks is ""even greater clamping down of information and ... a new age of the security state"", then there is something fundamentally wrong, that goes beyond WikiLeaks.  It seems irrational to argue that such changes would never happen IF ONLY WikiLeaks wasn't around.<p>The closest analogy in terms of effect on American policy and society would be 9/11.  9/11 was a barbaric, indefensible act, but the US has vastly over-reacted in the following decade, with no signs of slowing down.  How much of the blame for the over-reaction belongs to Al Qaeda, and how much points to a systemic problem with how the US government deals with crises and the tradeoff between security and personal rights?<p>Now, WikiLeaks hasn't flown any planes into buildings. They haven't killed anyone.  They've made state secrets public, which is a serious matter - but, pragmatically, they've embarrassed and caused more work for a number of diplomats, and not much else.  That doesn't necessarily make them praise-worthy, but does it really warrant violent or even lethal opposition?<p>Look, the reality is none of us have any real clue about what WikiLeaks means.  All we know is that technology means the rules are changing.  I only really see two possible trends for the future - more openness, or more control.  I'm not convinced that what WikiLeaks is doing is right, but given the choice of how I would prefer the world to look like in 20 years, I'd pick more openness over more control.  Your preference seems to be for more control, since you seem to feel that an assassination of Julian Assange by the US government would be justified.<p>Edit: saw your comment about assassination.  You can disregard that part of my comment, although since Julian Assange is not a US citizen (and neither am I, for that matter), our ideas for what ""lethal force"" implies in this context are probably different.<p>Edit2: Have you read ""The World is Flat""?

I am on the verge of getting funding for my company from some family friends, and I could really use some advice from those in the crowd who are familiar with setting up the legal paperwork for a startup that is getting funded.<p>Lately we have YC, TechStars, Founders Fund and others open sourcing the documents they use to open a Delaware corporation and set up the investor structure in the right way.<p>Fred Wilson recently posted on his blog regarding standardized funding docs, where he actually prefers them, because they make it easy to understand how things are structured, when you enter into talks with VCs. I suspect that many VCs appreciate this.<p>http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/standardized-venture-funding-docs.html<p>So that leads me to ask ... how much more needs to be done that is not covered by the standard docs? If we assume that the investors are your friends & family and aren't out to do a high powered negotiation -- they just want to set things up correctly and keep going.<p>1. Can we do this ourselves by reading the docs and filling in the blanks?<p>2. Can we get a lawyer to look over it for a couple hours and help fill in the blanks? (Much cheaper than a custom opening of a company)<p>3. Could anyone outline the steps that we'd need to take if we wanted to use one of these documents and work with our investors to open a company correctly? Preferably with a convertible note?<p>I want to set things up correctly, but at the same time I am wondering what I would be paying the lawyer to do. This isn't a rhetorical question, I really just want to know what I'm missing and what the pitfalls would be if I tried to do it myself.<p>I'm sure a lot of entrepreneurs have the same question.

1977252,comment,1976698,1976698,0,0,stevewa,,,"please read my comments while wearing a teflon jacket. these are not personal attacks, just my personal thoughts about a book about how to make a web startup. i'm trying to build a new startup and reading all these blogs, and at times it seems like the authors of these blogs are pontificating their thoughts and trying to sell their own book, or speaking engagements, or whatever. So I start the discussion as a jaded a-hole. It's just where I am at right now. sorry.<p>I don't like the title. sounds like a book about running to lose weight. maybe it'll change by the time the final comes out. i quickly paged-down through 39 pages of the pdf, and most everything seems to be a rehash of stuff I've read on blogs. is the value of the book come from having all these concepts in one place? can a book have value anymore because once it is written it is basically obsolete? and do entreprenuers have time to read a book, especially a  141 page book? in your about the author section you say you've been doing start-ups for 7 years, but you don't explain if the startups became successful, so can we trust what you wrote as a valid recipe for success, or is it just adnecdotal musings of personal ideas, etc. the book is written in the tone of preaching, i.e. this is how to do it, but so far it lacks the exact how to do it steps. I think that is what programmers are most fond of, a book of recipes that show you how to make something work, and they can do it and it works. yes I know, this is a lot trickier. there is no right or wrong, no compiler to validate that you're doing it the right way. maybe this book is more for a business person who will just hire or subcontract a programmer and drive them crazy with pivots every hour :)<p>that's all the time i have for right now, i'll try to stay up even later tonight (after my coding work has burned out my brain) to read some more and make more comments. thanks for sharing it.",1291677791

While bluetooth doesn't allow multiple clients as wifi does, it's more energy conservative (being a PAN, not LAN).<p>(I had Novatel MiFi, and it run out of battery in ~6 hours if you forgot to switch it off (happened regularly to me).  Bluetooth connection automatically terminates when you eg. close your Macbook.)",1291676812

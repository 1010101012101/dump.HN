First, many will have already ""made it"" and won't have the same drive that they once had.

Maybe they'll let you be an employee at their new startup.<p>Palantir is full of people who are itching to start a company, and we'll see dozens of startups by Palantir alums after Palantir exits (it's already happening; see posterous.com).

I'd prefer it if you address the points I've made, instead of the ones you think I've made.<p>Before you asked for a <i>real currency, backed by something.</i>  With the implicit point that you don't believe the numbers.<p>Well my point is that any basket of goods implicitly defines a currency.  Therefore food defines a currency, which is backed by the very real effort and resources it takes to produce that food.  I've shown that GDP per capita in that ""currency"" has gone up.  I presented figures for the USA because that is what I found first, but the same is true for the world as a whole.  This is true at the same time that the number of people has gone up.  Which means that food production must have gone up <i>a lot</i>.<p>You demanded a real measuring stick.  I gave one.  There is nothing special about that measuring stick.  You can adjust for inflation using the CPI.  You can adjust by many specific things we use daily, such as the cost of energy or metal.  GDP has gone up.<p>Now you say that it is an apples and oranges comparison?  Well of course it is!  Productivity increases because we do things more efficiently.  Using 1920s methods and technology we can't be any more productive today than we were 80 years ago.  But we're using 2010 methods and technology, and there is a stark difference.  The result is that today we generate more stuff, services, and things people want than at any point in history.<p>So yes, you are trivially right that inflation makes GDP numbers meaningless in isolation.  But those numbers don't exist in isolation.  We have lots of ways to adjust for inflation.  After you have done so, it is clear that you can quibble about specific numbers but the broad point is good.  Productivity has gone up.",1288682224

At least not enough to live off.<p>As far as getting insights goes, the academics that I worked with had no idea about the industry or even how it works. So any insight coming from them is one better ignored.<p>I'm mistaken perhaps?",1288681820

Plotkin is a fucking genius.  50 years from now, I think people will still be playing <i>Spider and Web</i>, <i>Shade</i>, and <i>So Far</i>.<p>This makes me want to mail $75 to Nick Montfort, Emily Short, Graham Nelson, and Adam Cadre with a postcard that says ""PLEASE DO THIS, WE WILL PAY YOU.""",1288681753

Sortof like how the Envato network of sites are all similar but unique.<p>So, in your opinion, would it seem too odd to visitors if Techinch.com looks entirely different than Techinch.com/apps?

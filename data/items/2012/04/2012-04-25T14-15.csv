3889337,comment,3888088,3888088,1,0,skore,,,"This is great. The Show offers each player with three possible outcomes, which makes negotiation hard because the highest incentive is on getting all the money (choosing Steal while tricking the opponent into choosing Split), while the lowest incentive is on nobody getting anything.<p>What Nick does by saying that he will definitely Steal is reducing the choices for Abraham to two: Split or Loose. Actually just one: Loose, albeit with a promise to <i>also</i> split.<p>The cunning bit about the plan, of course, is that Nick never intends to choose Steal. Choosing Steal is foolish to begin with: There is a 50% chance that nobody will get anything if you choose steal, so by default, players should stay away from it. ""Count your blessings"", so to speak.<p>What is clever about this is that Nick has replaced the technical bet with a social one: He has done something that appeals to his opponent, by challenging his intellect, turning the game on its head. For Nick, the chances are now that either he gets half or nothing. He, internally, accepts a lower possible payout to himself to maximize the probability that the ""group"" will cash out. In any outcome, this would mean that it's no longer ""He tried to get the money"", but ""He tried to make sure <i>we</i> get the money"". I would say there is a pretty good chance that Abraham would have decided to give him half, even had he decided to Steal, basically matching Nicks generosity. This is supported by the fact that Nick really did end up displaying the Split - Had Abraham revealed a Steal at that point, he surely would have felt like quite bad about this (""He did it to help us both, after all!"").<p>Nick has simply maximized the chances of a Split on all available vectors.",1335365473

On a cheap camera this is about the frame time because the electronics is slow, but on a high end camera it is still often close to the frame time because you have a lot of pixels and there is a limit to how fast you can read while still having low noise. Some scientific CMOS cameras get round this by having massively parallel outputs.<p>The problem gets worse at 48fps - if it takes close to 1/48s to read the chip then a moving object will have stretched across the entire frame from top to bottom. In the worst case a vertical post in a fast pan will be at 45deg. A 24fps camera run at the same pixel clock only has half the effect.<p>The cameras do have software to try and correct this - basically they look for vertical edges and de-skew them, but this puts in artifacts that you don't want in a Hollywood movie.

Mostly math, probability, statistics (yes even for psychology) then methodology skills and also maybe leadership, communication skills and dedication to science (last only because it is difficult to measure).<p>update:typos",1335364955

You can't take market away from an absolute incumbent with 98% of the market when at best you're just as good, but usually half that.<p>I also don't see them mentioning pricing, but the Atom package should cost somewhere in the $80-$100 range.

Not only are there numerous games that flatly contradict your view, but you're ignoring many facets of games themselves. Mobile games can only provide a limited experience when compared to other platforms.<p>When you move from a mobile device to a console, you gain better controls, deeper gameplay (can you compare Draw Anything to Mario Galaxy?), and a much more reliable and centralized platform backing it in terms of networked play.  This comparison repeats itself moving from consoles to the desktop. You gain better controls again, better hardware, and often, deeper gameplay. (Can you compare Mario Galaxy to StarCraft or World of Warcraft?). There's really just no way to compress the amount of complexity involved in the typical MMO onto a console, much less a mobile device. And while it's fair propose that this complexity creates a barrier, I think an argument could be made for the inverse as well.<p>Mobile devices could just as easily act as a gateway to deeper and more complex games and their platforms.

The problem with this argument and the math that's always used to support it, is that it comes from the view point of simply making money. If it were as simple as (number_of_hours_worked * number_of_people = awesome_product) then a company would always be able to throw money at a problem and fix it.<p>In the real world this is so obviously not the case that it's laughable that anyone makes the argument in the first place. If you're starting a company and you knew that in order to succeed all you had to do was work more hours than the other guy, of course you'd do it.<p>If your goals in business are to make money, then working crazy hours and ignoring everything else in your life probably makes sense. If you want to build a long lasting, sustainable business full of happy, productive employees who make great stuff then you probably want to make sure the work life balance is as good as it can be.",1335364134

This would explain why I mostly see requests for <i>Linux</i> ports of games, and OSX users are nowhere as vocal. Different appeal, I guess. Linux appeals more to power users and various enthusiasts, while OSX - hard to say as I know no one using it.

My unfounded speculation is that OSX devices are more common among people who just want their computer to get out of the way.

Why would Linux finally having a capability that everyone else has had for years cause Linux to surpass Mac OSX?<p>Because it works both ways. Linux has numerous features other systems only acquired recently or still don't have. Convenient package management, and a <i>culture</i> of it. Linux devs are accustomed to packaging applications. There are all sorts of magic you can do with booting from USB or other media. Frowned upon when you perceive your software as intellectual property. Ridiculous customization options. It's almost like no two people use the same Linux distro, and I can't blame them because people have different needs. That's why it's misguided to try to come up with the ultimate Linux distro. It's like trying to come up with the best (non-programming) language.<p>And culture matters. I moved from Ubuntu to Debian because I feel more comfortable with these people. By default, they tell me not only how to do X but <i>why</i>, and I love it. I admit many Debian users act arrogant and grumpy, but I consider these flaws <i>less</i> annoying.

The result? We have no better idea what the typical mind is like than we did a hundred years ago, but we have exhaustive lists of subtly different atypical models so encompassing that almost anybody could be recognized as having a psychological problem of some sort!<p>Describing a new disease (atypical model) is one of the only ways to get recognized in the field.

3889137,comment,3888368,3888368,4,0,blhack,,,"First: node is freaking <i>amazing</i>.  I've been writing python CGI on Apache for the last few years, but can easily see myself moving to:<p>nginx -> Static html/javascript/images/css<p>node.js -> API<p>Apache -> old Python CGI stuff I still want (beautiful soup, for instance)<p>To me, this stack is a lot more comfortable, and is a <i>lot</i> faster.<p>----<p>Here are a couple of things that this tut misses.<p>1) You need to talk to your database.  This will become immediately apparent when you try to do anything.  You can google around, which will lead you to stack overflow, or you can just listen to me right here and use ""mysql"".<p><pre><code>     npm install mysql
</code></pre>
Easy.<p>2) Callbacks.  This is freaking <i>huge</i>.  node will not make any sense to you if you do not understand this.  For instance, if you have a function called ""get_username()"" (Hi!  I have a function called get username, I'm speaking from a mistake I made about this!), and you call it like this:<p><pre><code>     username = get_username();      
     res.write(""Hi, you are: "" + username);
     res.end(""buhbye!"");
</code></pre>
Your page is just going to crash because username is undefined.  This is because node is nonblocking.  It doesn't wait for get_username() to return before continuing...meaning your server will end before get_username() finishes.<p>This is a problem.<p>So what you need to do won't make sense at first (and maybe I'm doing this wrong, correct me if I am).<p>you would do:<p><pre><code>    get_username(res);

</code></pre>
and then you would have:<p><pre><code>    function get_username(res) {

        do_some_things;
        db.query(query, function() { ;
             //this is your db connectors callback function.  It fires when your query is finished. 
             username = some_query_results['user'];
             res.write(""Hello, you are: "" +  username);
             call_some_other_function();
             or_if_this_is_the_last_thing_you_want_to_do_call res.end();
             });
     }
</code></pre>
The point here [and this is obviously just pseudocode] is that you don't just write out a list of functions.  You write functions that call each other when they're finished.<p>read this: <a href=""http://blog.mixu.net/2011/02/01/understanding-the-node-js-event-loop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mixu.net/2011/02/01/understanding-the-node-js-ev...</a>",1335362449

Why do we need people named Gavin? If Gavin wants to do compsci, that&#x27;s cool, but if not, then he can go do whatever makes him happy?<p>The point is, we don&#x27;t need _person type X_ simply for the sake of an equal number of all types of people.

You can be interested in people or whatever and see code as a way to accomplish your goals.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that in some tech circles, social and emotional motivations (and especially ones with negative valence like anger and disappointment) are seen as sort of unreal and invalid. I understand that people often want to focus on choosing the product/technology/protocol/whatever that&#x27;s objectively the best, but I think there are cases where it&#x27;s warped the culture such that people get into cliques and develop (sometimes intense) social motivations based on perfectly valid factors like trust and respect, but pretend that those motivations are entirely based on dispassionate technical analysis.<p>I guess I&#x27;m not sure what my point is. Maybe it&#x27;s that social &quot;drama&quot; is inevitable, but tech communities make it toxic because of a misguided belief that it&#x27;s irrelevant, and this dynamic causes splash damage for women who are more heavily socialized to value personal relationships. Maybe it&#x27;s just a brain fart, but I think it would explain a lot.",1444615106

The first time was smooth and the bank account happened without a meeting (at HSBC) although I didn&#x27;t use the structure and folded it a year later.<p>The second time was a lot less smooth, I had to fly to Hong Kong to meet HSBC, and after they took a relatively annoying processing fee and grilled me on my business model (IT consulting), rejected my application with no explanation about 3 months later. The agent told us most foreigners were routinely declined these days although they didn&#x27;t know why.<p>We thus opened a company in the UK instead (yes, it&#x27;s still a great offshore location!). Fast (minutes on the Companies House website), cheap (< 100 GBP?) but the bank (Lloyds) hit us with a fraud check which months later is still not resolved, despite reams of paperwork travelling around and notaries public making a small fortune in certifying documents, and my co-founder being a UK resident. Lloyds asked us for more information than the Singapore Government did for my PR (equivalent to US green card) application. Since you can&#x27;t do business on a personal bank account if you have a UK Ltd, that structure is basically inactive.",1444615096

10372091,comment,10370669,10371962,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I don&#x27;t actually have any textbook recommendations for you, but with respect to Comp. Sci., keep in mind that there is a difference between Comp. Sci. and programming.  Obviously there is a large overlap, and you can use a lot of Comp. Sci. theory in every day programming, but programming is a discipline unto itself.<p>I think programming is a lot like writing (prose).  You need to read a lot and write a lot.  If you want to be a great programmer, I think you should be programming every day -- not just school, or work assignments, but you own code.  You need to find your own voice.  It is hard to find time to do it, I know.  Also, read as much as you can.  Open Source software is ideal because you can read code from a lot of different authors.  Sometimes people only read their own code or code from their colleagues at work.  This can really stunt their growth.  Sometimes I think there should be a &quot;Programming&quot; degree in the arts faculties at universities...<p>I&#x27;m not a scientist, I&#x27;m a programmer.  However, the theory that I think will help you most is:<p>- Automata and grammars.  Specifically you should know the theory, be able to make regular expressions and be able to write/read BNF.  You should definitely know the Chomsky hierarchy and be able to recognize the type of grammar by looking at the BNF or code (this is especially important if you ever write a file format or design a communications protocol).<p>- Group theory<p>- Linear algebra<p>- Basic calculus (may or may not find differential equations useful depending on what you are programming)<p>- Basic statistics (definitely need to know what probability distributions are...  lately I&#x27;ve been thinking that Bayes theorem is getting to be more and more important).<p>- Algorithmic complexity (i.e. O() notation).<p>For studying programming:<p>- You should be aware of design patterns and be able to recognize them in code (you don&#x27;t have to go crazy on it, though).  There are lots of good books on the subject.  Or just browse c2 wiki.<p>- You should know how to do test first programming.  Kent Beck&#x27;s book &quot;Test Driven Development: By Example&quot;, is arguably not the best book on the topic, but it is the book I always recommend to beginners because it is the most straight forward.  Other books tend to conflate a lot of issues and to push points of view that (in my mind at least) have yet to prove themselves.  Beck&#x27;s book will give you the basics and allow you to move on from there.<p>- You should know how to make UML object diagrams.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know of any books on the subject that deal only with object diagrams.  You don&#x27;t have to use UML diagrams in real life, but they contain the concepts that you can use when sketching designs.<p>- You should know how to refactor code that is under test.  Michael Feather&#x27;s &quot;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&quot; is the only good book I know on the topic.  It is very advanced, though.  There may be more gentle introductions somewhere.  Martin Fowler&#x27;s book is a great reference book, but it is not useful for a beginner IMHO.<p>These are the basics, from my point of view.  I recommend also learning at least one programming language from each of:<p>- modular (C, Pascal, etc)<p>- Strongly typed OO (C++, Java, C#, etc)<p>- Dynamically typed OO (Ruby, Python, etc)<p>- Pure functional (Lisp, Scheme, Haskel, etc)<p>- Declarative (XSLT, Prolog, etc...)<p>- Assembly (microcorruption.com is a great introduction)<p>Obviously you won&#x27;t use all of these things all the time (and some you will never use), but for me if someone has all of these things it gives them a good base to work from.  I&#x27;m probably forgetting some important stuff as well, but that&#x27;s enough to get you started.",1444614932

10372083,comment,10370067,10370067,0,0,greggman,,,"I&#x27;m guessing the problem this is trying to solve<p>Originally we had prefixed APIs. webkitAudioContext for example. The idea was the prefix would be removed. Unfortunately the problem was thousands of websites would use the prefixed API. Now you can&#x27;t remove the prefixed version without breaking many many sites. Worse, there&#x27;s even arguably an incentive for other browser to add someone else&#x27;s prefix because they want their browser to run all those same sites.<p>So, a couple of years ago the browser vendors all agreed, no more prefixes. They&#x27;ll put all the new stuff behind flags that developers can opt into. The problem with that is no one uses them. The users aren&#x27;t going to set the flag so no devs have any reason to try out the APIs. There&#x27;s no re-world usage to see that the APIs work, to see what issues come up.<p>So, there&#x27;s this one. Select a few special devs, let them use the features, enable those features for their domain only. Real users get to use the features with no work on their part. It solves the problem to some extent. The devs know the feature might not last. They&#x27;re also signed up to get notification if the feature is going to change or be removed. And, I guess their motivation is to one up their competitors.<p>And that last part is the whole problem with this proposal. Unless any dev can sign up then only special &quot;chosen&quot; devs get the competitive advantage. That feels wrong for some reason. I don&#x27;t have a better solution to suggest though.<p>edit:<p>-- ugh --<p>I suppose I should have clicked the link which said all of this<p><a href=""https://infrequently.org/2015/08/doing-science-on-the-web/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://infrequently.org/2015/08/doing-science-on-the-web/</a>",1444614783

Perhaps humans may eventually all be set up with a &quot;dual-homed&quot; network, but there will be many humans who won&#x27;t want to disconnect from their original LAN. And to do that, there needs to be a way of uploading what they were initially given and subjectively &quot;switching&quot; to that upload.<p>At the least, the option needs to be there, I think. I think entirely merging your mind into a &quot;hivemind&quot; is a form of death, even if it&#x27;s something less bad than conventional death.

In fact, Dr. Cheryan’s research shows that young men tend not to major in English for the same reasons women don’t pick computer science: They compare their notions of who they are to their stereotypes of English majors and decide they won’t fit in.<p>The thing is that computer science and english lit are not exchangeable. In fact, if computer science were done in pink cubicles adorned with the above-mentioned purportedly feminine accoutrements, men and women would still do computer science, because it would still be critical to technological advance and modern economies in a direct, and remunerated, way which English Lit is not.",1444614742

Billboards are the prime example. I wasn&#x27;t watching TV, I was just driving, but suddenly billboards.
2. Next step is to eliminate ads bundled with media (at least in the traditional sense -- I am actually pro-product placement). In other words, you are not legally allowed to interrupt a media broadcast, or print article, with an ad that interrupts the consumer&#x27;s experience.<p>This includes online banner ads, gmail text ads, commercials inside of TV shows and radio broadcasts, etc.<p>&quot;But how will those artists/outlets make their living?&quot; Hell if I know.

One can certainly debate why this is and of course it&#x27;s possible to trace this phenomena historically back into the days of ancient greek culture and before.<p>My feeling on the matter personally though is that the cultural norms of highschoolers have simply not had time to adapt to the idea that &quot;geek is sheik&quot; because the sentiment has only existed (outside of hacker culture) for the last decade (and perhaps it&#x27;s still only a thing in California).  In addition to that there has never been a &quot;female astronaut moment&quot; for computer science, so to speak in terms of it breaking into the consciousness of the average teen.  This may be a chicken/egg type problem.<p>I think this is shifting now, but my opinion is that the biases which effected how highschoolers were feeling 15 or 20 years ago about computer science are still skewing the hiring statistics today because there are far fewer women job applicants who have been doing this kind of programming work for 15 or 20+ years...<p>How many were programming BBS systems in ANSI C back before AOL was a thing, or how many were following along with the early web as the standards (things like CSS) were being flushed out and it&#x27;s possibilities were being explored (intro <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_B31nF3sU0&t=2m10s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_B31nF3sU0&t=2m10s</a>)<p>According to the statistics there are a lot more men who have been engaged in &quot;Internet engineering&quot; in one form or another for most of their life and this kind of multidisciplinary computer-science background can skew a hiring decision in their favor assuming both candidates are equally well versed with the most current technologies.  Young programmers find ways to make up for the often times narrower scope of their experience (lack of a lisp beard) by being really good at the things that they specialize in, and by tracking more closely the cutting edge.  I feel there are more women who are joining this cohort every day, but there are still not as many and it&#x27;s a shame.",1444612077

I&#x27;ll bite, however, and share some of my feedback.<p>> Tesla leveraged itself to the hilt on batteries in a prediction of rising gas costs forcing a switch to electric vehicles, but fracking and shale oil drove crude prices from $146 from their peak in June of 2008 to pretty consistently under $50 these days. Oil might drop even further.<p>If cars were just about gasoline pump prices, there would be no SUVs. Tesla&#x27;s model X is the first car I&#x27;ve ever <i>wanted</i> in life. I&#x27;ve owned cars, and I currently own a car, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve <i>wanted</i>, wanted. Similarly, I have other more-technology-able friends that are simply waiting for Tesla&#x27;s first truck to buy one. BMW announced they&#x27;re building more and more electric vehicles despite despite crude oil prices. That tipping point is done for. You can get it down to $10 a gallon and I&#x27;m not sure it would matter. You&#x27;re changing the prices on the cigarettes, not the fact they cause cancer.<p>>why I believe that Musk got so defensive in a German newspaper when confronted with rumors of Apple’s self-driving car project and began to so aggressively attack them: “Important engineers? They have hired people we’ve fired.<p>This might be a bit of fear about competition, yes, but it is not all about Tesla. He was similarly pissed off when Blue Origin starting attracting workers away from him. I believe they even set up email alerts to monitor for Blue Origin email addresses, but I don&#x27;t know that part for sure.<p>>and the government is the customer on a third of SpaceX’s launches and probably well over half its revenue.<p>True, but that&#x27;s a good thing, not a bad thing. It shows that they&#x27;re winning contracts away from organizations like United Launch Alliance, which is a Lockheed Martin Space Systems and Boeing Defense partnership. Shouldn&#x27;t ULA be able to utterly push them out of contracts if they were just full of bullshit?<p>>tirelessly for him for years and were tossed to the curb like a piece of litter without a second thought.<p>This is fairly true from everything I know.

Elon isn&#x27;t so much the Mono rail guy in that sense, but the guy that comes in after and says, &quot;Holy crap, I can give you a monorail in less time and money than those current people&quot; Actually, I&#x27;m one to believe the rumors that he started it just to poke those companies, and then when people started taking it more seriously and giving it traction it was sort of a &quot;Oh? Really Okay let&#x27;s go with this&quot; situation. In other words, I think the hyperloop got more traction than Elon and his associates thought it would and so now they&#x27;re running with it.",1444612073

The studies that Dan Pink is referring to concern the more recent advent of creative and cognitive work does not have centuries and centuries of evidence for money as a motivator.  That's why it's being studied, and that's partly why the results of the studies are so intriguing.<p>It's interesting that your gut reaction is that this is all nonsense, and that you dismiss a single presentation as being nonsense purely on your own feelings and reactions.  The book that Dan Pink wrote, and the work being done in the field is at odds with your reaction.<p>I know I won't convince you, and I know that you'll simply dismiss me as crazy, or stupid, or both, but the programmers who work for me often took a pay cut to do so.  And they've stayed.<p>My recent complaints haven't been about being able to find good programmers, they've been about incompetent programmers who claim they're great, and in all probability honestly believe it.<p>If you're solving any problem at all, it's the wrong one.  I don't want more job applicants, I just want applications from better candidates.  My experience, and the studies I've read, say that offering more money won't help.

  * Explore comments and threads
  * Browse web links without quitting using the in-app browser

All of these things are true for browsing Hacker News in mobile Safari as well. That's hardly enough to earn the predicate ""insanely great"" or the $3 price tag in my world.<p>Admittedly, using Hacker News on an iPhone is not the best mobile browser experience (it could certainly use some css @media queries and perhaps a meta viewport tag, essentially few minutes of work would do the trick), but that hardly warrants a native app, especially if it's not free.",1277981832

I've been told to get into Javascript.
Silly question(one of those with many possible answers),but are there any other key coding skills or languages one should be familiar with,to get started at entry level in the web development industry?

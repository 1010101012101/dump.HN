There's no reason why it shouldn't work, and if it does, it'll be great.<p>But the numbers in the article don't quite seem to work out. The first ""commercial-scale"" plant in 2011 will only make 100,000 gallons a year. Assuming they make it for $1 a gallon in raw materials and sell it for $3 a gallon, you've still got a chemical plant whose gross profit is barely enough to employ two people. Is that really ""commercial scale""?",1201305572
104406,comment,104063,104339,0,0,edw519,,,"I realize we're beating this to death, but so what.<p>It's never my priority, it's always my customers' priority.<p>Here's my life right now:<p>Customer is opening new warehouse in 2 weeks and calls me to change whatever software needs changed to split orders to print in the appropriate warehouse.  I agree because I'm a masochist.  I find 15,000 lines of code to do what I (and you too, probably) could have done in less than 1000.  Most of it was clearly written by someone who had no idea what they were doing, much of it is never accessed, much of it has never run properly, and I have to do something.  I rewrite what, in my professional opinion, must be rewritten.  I workaround what I can, and I add what I need.  I want it to work right the first time and I never want to come back (until new business requirements come along).  I am usually very successful doing this, making changes during unit and system testing and finishing in a day or two.<p>I use to be bitter about cleaning up other peoples' mess because they were too lazy, stupid, rushed for time, or whatever.  But no more.  I've turned around my thinking to use all of this as a motivator to build solid business apps where no one ever has to go though this again.<p><closing loop...> THAT'S what has motivated me to do my start-up.<p>I threw out my original example because it's a classic, it came to mind quickly, and most readers here, even the juniors, could understand it.  I had no idea it would spawn such discussion.  Nice talking to you.",1201305553
104405,comment,104284,104321,0,0,dmoney,,,"I agree.  In addition to making my teeth hurt, the design wastes a lot of space.  Also, it's annoying having to click each heading just to see ""link to microsoft KB article""<p>But it is a good idea.  Maybe I'll give a real e-mail address next time.",1201305316
104404,comment,104291,104341,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"If I remember correctly, the gaming / graphics wars started to heat up around '96, with the Nvidia / Rendition / 3dfx wars.  I remember when games used to have Glide support separate from Direct3D / OpenGL.  Interesting that ATI, who is Nvidia's only competition now, was really a non-player during all of the 90's.",1201305241

He basically said if you want to work with video, or games, you have to use flash, which has been true up to this point on the web.",1201304837
104401,comment,104284,104334,0,0,thorax,,,"Well, we've studied a lot of SEO (for other sites) and didn't intend really for bug.gd to be that kind of a ""content"" site initially. I think we need to revisit this, though, so your pointers are quite valid. We got an incredible amount of traffic last year when we were covered on TechCrunch and other sites, but that settles-down after the initial fanfare.<p>We've prototyped some text classification mechanisms to try to pinpoint the product/category from the error message, but  I think we're going to wait until we get more of our embeddable libraries released (that could be included in specific products), our planned Dr. Watson replacement available, and maybe some subsites for particular technologies (e.g. Ruby and Python error messages).<p>We'll see what we can do, but high on the ROI list would be getting the solution pages less 'deep' for search engine crawling-- thanks for the advice there.<p>Keep in mind (or FYI), our revenue model is actually not focused on ads or anything of that nature. We're looking to use bug.gd as an engine/toolset to sell to corporations that want to have more a P2P tech support model to reduce help desk costs. Lots of little ideas for this, but this project was really driven by the need for this in a large enterprise I was formerly involved with. The productivity gains can be impressive when your employees have a collective wisdom when it comes to problems.<p>Due to this path for the company, the core bug.gd site is really intended just to build up solutions to help everyone while remaining free and ad-free. We think of it as a win-win situation and really want all of our new sites to work that way.<p>Thanks again.",1201304558

104398,comment,104221,104331,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"I think the whole point of the ""Hackintosh"" concept is that it's a custom PC with similar hardware to what Apple uses.  If you take the time, it's not that hard to find out which device chipsets OSX supports, and most chipsets are used by a variety of manufacturers.  Not to say that everything will be flawless, but most major issues can be avoided by carefully choosing the hardware.",1201304229

104393,comment,104199,104199,0,0,danohuiginn,,,"use beautiful soup (best python scraping system I know of). Maybe combine it with mechanize for navigating between the pages.
Don't try to create your own pattern-matching file. Write a generic crawler class, subclass it for each site. In the end you should just need to write a couple of short site-specific functions for each site.<p>It doesn't take long once you get going - that is, until you run into sites that are unnavigable piles of javascript and unstructured html.",1201304034

104390,comment,104319,104319,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I take issue with the suggestion to use Flash instead of Javascript. If you can use Javascript instead of Flash, by all means, do it. Flash is much less cross-platform, it isn't even 64-bit yet (at least on Linux), it tends to leak memory all over the place, and it provides more access to my system than I would like. I block most Flash, with the exception of Youtube and a few others.",1201303879

I would still argue that influencers are more influential than the average Joe, but I'd agree that hanging your marketing results on reaching them is so important.  imho these ""how to get the word out there"" concepts all circle back to ""just build a good product.""<p>Provide real value and you win.<p>Most interesting paragraph I found:<p>""""If society is ready to embrace a trend, almost anyone can start one--and if it isn't, then almost no one can,"" Watts concludes.

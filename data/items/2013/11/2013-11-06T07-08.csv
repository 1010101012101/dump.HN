6681462,comment,6680696,6681335,2,0,montecarl,,,"Is your statement true? Why should it be a forgone conclusion that our bodies are able to convert all macronutrients into energy with 100% efficiency? If you maintain a stable weight for 1 year does this mean you managed to perfectly balance caloric intake with caloric expenditure? That when you ate that extra cookie or drank an extra soda that you needed those calories to offset some energy expenditure? That seems hard to believe.<p>One interesting question that I do not know the answer to is the kinetics of metabolism for different macronutrients. How quickly can our bodies metabolize fat, protein, and carbohydrates? Is it possible that our bodies convert carbohydrates into energy very quickly, thus leading to an excess of energy that gets stored as fat? While other nutrients get digested much more slowly and only used if needed?<p>The basic question is do all ingested calories get used? Does the body have a mechanism for maintaining a certain &quot;ideal&quot; weight that can function across a range of caloric intakes?",1383724680

6681456,comment,6676494,6678985,1,0,gojomo,,,"Most often professional tech startup investments are either (a) purchases of stock in a company; or (b) a &#x27;convertible&#x27; loan to the company (that&#x27;s expected to turn into shares when a full stock-sale round happens).<p>In both cases, the money enters the company&#x27;s accounts, not the founders&#x27; accounts, and is used over time for business purposes.<p>If the company fails there&#x27;s little or no money left to pay anyone back. In an orderly liquidation, there might be a little left over, or picked up from an asset/tech fire-sale. Those amounts go first to pay back creditors, first among them anyone owed salaries, as much as possible. If any is left over, it&#x27;s split proportionately among shareholders, usually first to &#x27;preferred&#x27; shareholders (professional investors). But by this point the liquidated value is likely to be nothing, or pennies on the dollar.<p>Professional diversified investors understand this: sometimes the shares go to zero, and sometimes debts are uncollectable.<p>It&#x27;s not common for the founders to offer personal guarantees of repayment. (In other kinds of going-concern small-business financing, like bank loans or equipment financing, where the founders/officers have the means, they may offer such guarantees to lenders... but not in highly risky tech startups.)<p>Now, there&#x27;s a fair chance that the founders themselves depleted savings or ran up personal debts to feed the company  investing/loaning their own funds, working for little or no salary in the expectation of gains later. So it&#x27;s often still a draining financial hit... but the professional investors aren&#x27;t expecting a formal debt repayment.<p>Instead, if the investors think the failure came after a good honest try, and was a learning experience for founders who will succeed at other times and opportunities, they&#x27;ll favorably consider investing in a future venture, or help place the team elsewhere. So it&#x27;s never a total loss: everyone learns things to do, things to avoid, and how/when to work together.",1383724580
6681455,comment,6679280,6679530,7,0,simonh,,,"My understanding of this is that the last thing the NSA wants is to actually have to defend these notices in court, in public. Can you imagine Obama, or any president, having to defend forcing people to flat out lie to the public by retaining &quot;No 215 here&quot; notices when one has been received? That&#x27;s not going to happen. By best guess is that Apple would be able to challenge being put in that situation by the 215 notice&#x27;s terms effectively forcing them to self-incriminate.<p>Also Apple&#x27;s statement that if they get a 215 they will fight it means they are significantly less likely to be served one. 215s work mainly through fear and doubt and picking on people without the resources to defend themselves.<p>All this skullduggery is very effective when it&#x27;s in the shadows or off stage, it&#x27;s still actually a fairly marginal issue, but the more it gets pushed into the faces of ordinary voting Joes, the worse it gets for the spooks.",1383724570

Long hours over a lengthy duration of time have shown me two things: 1) an individual&#x27;s work ethic, and 2) bad management.<p>In the tech industry, specifically with software development, I&#x27;ve had teams I&#x27;ve managed where we needed to pull longer hours in order to meet a deadline.

Just one of the two isn&#x27;t enough: to get be even vaguely confident that surveillance ends, we need both. The technical fixes I can&#x27;t speak to, but the legislative ones I&#x27;ve been thinking about for a while. In the last week, there have been two prominent bills announced to deal with surveillance:<p>- Bill 1: The FISA Improvements Act, from Feinstein and the Senate Intelligence Committee. In short it legalizes most of what the NSA has been done.<p>- Bill 2: The USA FREEDOM ACT, from Sensenbrenner and Leahy, currently being considered by the House/Senate Judiciary committees. It amends 215 of FISA to end bulk phone metadata collection and fixes some of the problems with 702 of the FISA Amendments Act (under which PRISM is run). But it doesn&#x27;t fix 702 fully, does nothing to end BULLRUN (undermining encryption) nor the surveillance that happens outside FISA (MUSCULAR, for example, and god knows what else).<p>Obviously the Feinstein bill can&#x27;t be allowed to pass. But some really big names (ACLU, CDT) have thrown strong support behind the Freedom Act. I&#x27;m wondering what we as the Taskforce(.is) should do. It&#x27;s clear to me that it doesn&#x27;t go nearly far enough. And there&#x27;s some chance that if it passes, Congress will view this whole thing as &quot;dealt with&quot; and not revisit the issue for years to come. But unfortunately the Freedom Act barely has the votes to get out of the judiciary committee, and getting it to pass through both houses requires a lot of momentum.<p>We&#x27;ve been working on a campaign asking folks to call and oppose Feinstein, and potentially to support the Freedom Act. But I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a right move. Unfortunately, the public doesn&#x27;t understand why privacy is important, and Americans aren&#x27;t nearly angry enough for Congress to do anything more substantial than the Freedom Act. We might be able to push for amendments, but it&#x27;s a long shot.<p>tl;dr - We&#x27;ve got two bills in Congress. One is terrible, one is mediocre.

6681402,comment,6680696,6680696,5,0,KVFinn,,,"I think it is well established that you are better off with saturated fat and cholesterol heavy foods if it means no longer being obese.  Since compliance with any diet is so important, it probably is healthier for people in general to not worry about saturated fat and worry more about sugars and carbs and keeping weight in check. But that doesn&#x27;t mean saturated fat in your diet is an ideal you should aim for.<p>I&#x27;m partial to this explanation:<p><a href=""http://www.mprize.org/blogs/archives/2010/01/hi_dr_feinman_a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mprize.org/blogs/archives/2010/01/hi_dr_feinman_a...</a><p>>What I think we&#x27;re seeing is exactly the divergence within these populations that you know: that carb is really rather bad for overweight, insulin-sensitive people, such that replacing it even with SFA is relatively harmless -- whereas for lean, insulin-sensitive people, SFA (and dietary cholesterol, its fellow-traveller in omnivorous diets) is likely more <i>relatively</i> harmful, because carb is less able to derange the metabolism. We have to remember that any time we look at these studies and see only modest or borderline-significant effects: 66% of the US population is overweight, and half of that majority is obeese; Europe is somewhat better-off, at 49.8% and 13.3% in men and 36.0 & 13.5% in women per MONICA. So the deleterious effects of any nutrient with a differential effect on low-BMI, insulin-sensitive people will tend to be blunted by the much larger number of people for whom such effects are blunted by their &quot;larger&quot; problem.<p>>It also means that the deleterious effects of a rise in SFA intake are at least temporarily outweighed if it is is part of a dietary shift into a lower-carb diet when it is successfully used for weight loss (as opposed to just being a person&#x27;s self-selected default diet, which of course is what&#x27;s going on in teh studies in Jakobsen and in the Swedish, Greek, and US Nurses low-carb/high-protein studies). But it&#x27;s reasonably clear that if you&#x27;re insulin-sensitive -- which, interestingly, is what one is likely to become after losing weight on a successful low-carb weight-loss diet! -- the effects of SFA become more <i>relatively</i> harmful as teh deleterious effects of carb recede.<p>>t the end of the day, we have to go with what we&#x27;ve got. Until we get a couple of thousand healthy twenty-year-olds locked up in metabolic wards for sixty years or so for a really vigorous diet trial, I think saturated fat AND carbs (especially starchy carbs) stand out as things to reduce in the diet, in exchange for vegetables, fruit, lean protein, and PUFA (and probably MUFA) as things to maintain or increase. And most people should lose weight!",1383723759

Nobody else had access to that line, at least they weren&#x27;t supposed to. Splicing a fiber line is a bit outside the scope of your random attacker. You can&#x27;t blame Google for not anticipating a hostile break-in by the government. The discussion should absolutely, 100% be directed at the NSA here. To accept that a <i>private</i> network connection is open season for the government to tap is batshit insane.<p>> Moreover, it is not clear if other governments or criminals also had access to the users&#x27; data (e.g. in Google&#x27;s data centers located outside of the US). So far Google did not produce any public post-mortem thus we have no clue how bad was the problem.<p>How is Google supposed to tell you if they themselves didn&#x27;t know?<p>Although from the leaks it sounds like everyone is fucked thanks to the GCHQ and the NSA getting friendly with each other.",1383722924

Techcrunch40 didn&#x27;t charge startups to appear, Crunchbase was CC licensed and open, the Crunchpad was going to be sold at cost).<p>There was some upside for us, but in those first years the entirety of revenue was poured back into developing other projects (Crunchbase and Crunchpad were both 7-figure investments). The projects did help the brand, but likely not in any real ROI sense. I don&#x27;t know how Crunchbase was valued in the acquisition, it likely wasn&#x27;t, since the acquisition price was close to a market multiple on Techcrunch ad revenue alone.<p>They were all a lot of fun to work on, we had a great team of people, some excellent interns, developers and partners and it made working at Techcrunch all that more interesting (at many points we had more developers and people working on these projects than we did working on the main site). It was a philosophy of doing well while doing good.<p>The idea of Crunchbase was for it to be a co-op with other blogs, and that the writers would keep it updated while they wrote posts on each company. That didn&#x27;t work because the other blogs saw it as a threat (a lot of them ended up signing with a commercial alternative that had raised $5M and spent a lot of that money signing up blogs as part of &#x27;revenue guarantees&#x27;).<p>The active decision was then made to make Crunchbase open. This is alluded to in some of the other comments in this thread, and that is if you develop the site as a commercial service then users have an expectation that the data is up to date, correct and deep. The alternative is an open platform, where users and other blogs are part of it - the argument that when Wikipedia has poor information users don&#x27;t blame Wikipedia, they roll their sleeves up and fix it themselves. That was at the core of Crunchbase - not commercial, owned by users, therefor we wouldn&#x27;t have to make the tradeoff of &#x27;owning&#x27; it completely and having to invest extensively to keep the quality at a level expected of a full commercial service (although we did have almost a dozen people working on Crunchbase).<p>I don&#x27;t think AOL have thought that through in the same way. You can&#x27;t on one hand take advantage of the openness of user contributions, not keep the quality up with investment but at the same time expect to protect it as a commercial service. The only commercial ideas we had for Crunchbase were as additions, eg. custom reporting, research, etc. By design the platform was open, free, forkable and insulated from commercial acquisition.<p>That philosophy just came about naturally because of the group of people involved. There was a little skepticism, but it didn&#x27;t take long for everybody to start throwing out ideas on making and keeping things as open as possible. It shouldn&#x27;t surprise us that with an entirely new group of people (bar one, IIRC) and a new corporate parent that parts of it might be altered, but in reading Matt&#x27;s response I can see that 95% of what was in place is still there, they were just caught out and mishandled this one case. Very strange to see now that Techcrunch and the EFF are on opposite sides of an argument, I hope they clear it up. We used to monitor implementations[0] and send an email requesting a link back or a logo, never had a problem with it - it definitely never reached the point where a lawyer would be drafting a C&D.  I don&#x27;t think we ever reached the point of having a clone or API user that we didn&#x27;t get a along with.<p>[0] We setup a number of Crunchbase records that served as canaries - fake company names (on domains we registered) that were only in Crunchbase. If we find those company names anywhere online, it would be a hint that somebody took the data. If they didn&#x27;t cite the source, we would email them, and in almost all cases it was resolved amicably. We wanted nothing more than to enforce the &#x27;attribute&#x27; part of CC+A. A big part of the reason why Crunchbase records rank so well in SERP pages (it is usually in the top 5-6 results when searching for a name of a startup) is because of the &quot;free data, but link back&quot; policy. It means crunchbase.com was always the canonical source for Crunchbase data.",1383722651

24. Plaintiff asked Defendant Rodriquez if he was free to leave, <i>which Defendant Rodriquez contends that he found rude.</i> 
25. Defendant Rodriquez told Plaintiff he suspected Plaintiff of having illegal drugs in his car and proceeded to interrogate Plaintiff on the matter.<p>The officer felt that he&#x27;d not been shown correct respect by the victim and then decided to make him pay. To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure how much I blame the doctors in this fiasco, because I don&#x27;t know what sort of legal protections are available to them if they were to refuse to carry out the invasive operations. Do doctors in the US typically have a legal counsel who can advise them if a warrant is valid, or what operations an officer with a warrant can demand? I know I&#x27;d have no idea if a warrant were valid, or what the officer could compel me to do.",1383721965

The social context of sharing kind of overwhelms the technical difficulty of implementing it, so it becomes less a ""where are we going to put the bits"" problem and more of a ""who is sharing what with whom and how"" people problem.  It's never been a huge thing to me, but as I grow older I've come to learn that a lot of people close to me really, seriously care about the life stories of their families as documented by photos, and they're (still) not really well-served by the existing techy-friendly options.

I don't know much about Freenet, but I <i>do</i> know that if we can use bittorrent to share files using P2P, the same can presumably be done with websites. The most immediate problem that comes to mind is that, while the files being shared over P2P stay fairly constant, a website is more dynamic and gets updated a lot. I presume this could be solved by a PGP-like web of trust.<p>I'm sure there are plenty of other difficulties to deal with I and other can think of if I spend some more time thinking about it, but I think this would actually be a pretty neat thing to build. The great thing about this would be that the more likely something is to be censored right now, the <i>less</i> likely it is to be censored on something like this - more people would visit/download such things, thus creating extra nodes for other people to visit/download from.<p>EDIT: I just thought there <i>would</i> be an issue of privacy here that needs to be solved first. For example, if you can track the IP addresses of the people you're downloading your 'website updates' from, and you're visiting explicit sites, it becomes easy to tell whom of your friends are viewing those. ;) The easiest solution is to let people decide for themselves which sites to share, of course, but I wonder if this would mean many sites would be excluded, or whether the effects of this would be minimal.",1328109957

They can't offer full, real-time data for free.<p>I'm surprised how many people on HN are interested in this. If you are looking for real-time feeds, the best vendor I've found is <a href=""http://www.nanex.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nanex.net/</a> . They offer the whole feed, real-time, over the internet. Unfortunately you have to access it through their windows based dll. I can't understand why they don't have a native linux client...but they don't.<p>A very interesting source of data is BATS. I believe you can get free data feeds from BATS. Since they are a very liquid exchange, in many instances their prices can be proxies for the full market. Unfortunately, you need industrial strength  bandwidth to access that data (you can't just get it over the internet).<p>I believe there is space in the market for another market data vendor. Use good compression to drastically reduce bandwidth (see nanex), provide diverse client APIs (NOT nanex), slowly start to aggregate feeds from international exchanges, provide intelligent routing (100 clients in china should not make 100 connections to a NYC data center, they should connect to a local node), offer limited access to no cost exchanges, etc.<p>Unfortunately vendor agreements for exchanges are expensive enough that they are out of reach for bootstrapped operations.",1328109513

3538210,comment,3533256,3535335,2,0,jenius,,,"Hello Ladies and Gentlemen - since he forgot to introduce himself, let me introduce you to Lee Gillentine (<a href=""http://www.fishburd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fishburd.com/</a>). He is the one who made the above post, and is a little angry that I called his design crappy, and that I caught him trying to steal from me.<p>I certainly do not blame Mr. Gillentine for the numerous errors he made in the above post since most of this was just regurgitated from what he heard from Mr. Martinez, but unfortunately, almost everything he said was wrong. I have very clear documented evidence that this is so, which is why I won the court case. Let's take it point by point.<p>- The font was licensed<p>- It was written in html5, cross-browser tested, and worked perfectly<p>- Mr. Martinez's previous site was hosted on a godaddy shared server, and that site was made by Mr. Gillentine. Since I know godaddy hosting is horrible, I switched his hosting to FatCow before putting up the site. So not only was this inaccurate, but Mr. Gillentine is the culprit for his own criticism.<p>- The site was not delivered late, and my price wasn't doubled. I charged hourly, and made the rate clear in the contract that Mr. Martinez signed. I have documents in which he says that his time constraints are ""asap"", and that he doesn't have budget constraints. No final price was ever discussed, I just recorded my hours worked, put them on an invoice, and sent it.<p>- What Mr. Gillentine did was attempt to steal the site for Mr. Martinez by removing the stolen notice and re-hosting it on his own servers. Whenever you find yourself ripping someone's html and hosting it on your own website (much like Curebit did to 37signals), you <i>must</i> know that you are clearly doing something wrong. And yes, if you find someone trying to steal your work, you do typically send them an aggressive note telling them to take it down. And it worked.<p>- There was a rails back end, it was hosted elsewhere because (as I assume most people here know) you need a different server setup to handle a rails environment. The other host was mapped to a subdomain on the site.<p>- I never took down the site. In fact, I didn't even have access to the site, since Mr. Martinez tried to change all his hosting passwords and steal the site from me (that was why I triggered the stolen notice). Mr. Martinez took his own site down and parked his domain because it was better than facing the embarrassment of having a huge notice over your site telling everyone that you are a thief. I would have <i>loved</i> to have that notice stay up for longer.<p>- I have no ""history of posting complaints about how I have been screwed out of $500 and then taking them down"". This is 100% baseless, and makes no sense, I don't even know where he came up with this. Everything I post has and will stay up until I receive payment.<p>- I have spent, by my estimates, about 30 minutes in total telling this story over the web. In fact, I would assume that Mr. Gillentine's time ""web-stalking"" the issue far exceeded my time spreading the word about it.

As you can see from the history of SOPA/PIPA, his influence peddling was nearly successful in ramming this legislation through with little or no substantive debate.<p>Before that, he was the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. While Chairman, he refinanced his homes in Washington, DC and Connecticut with below market rates reserved for ""friends"" of the Countrywide Mortgage CEO. Note that Countrywide was one of the biggest issuers of fraudulent sub-prime mortgages. He asserted that he had no idea that he was receiving special treatment.<p>Before that, he bought a vacation house in Ireland with a Bear Sterns executive who was convicted of insider trading. He used his influence with President Clinton to help obtain a pardon for his partner.

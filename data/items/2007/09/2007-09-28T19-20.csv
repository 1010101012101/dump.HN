60797,comment,60507,60531,0,0,shadowplay,,,"""Girl"" isn't a pejorative unless you're determined to take it that way.  It has nothing to do with age; it's part of an informal nomenclature, as in ""girls and guys"".  I know many women who refer to themselves as ""girls"" -- including those in their fifties and sixties -- and/or use ""grrl"" in their online names, and there are even groups like LinuxChix which use ""chicks"" in a hip sense rather than a belittling one.  ""Girls' night out"" is another example.  I would even observe there's an inflection point where women above a certain age prefer the term and consider it a compliment to be referred to as such, as youth and vitality are desirable connotations.<p>And groups of women <i>do</i> refer to wanting to find more ""boys"" -- the terms ""men"" and ""women"" both seem to connote some kind of stodginess, probably because most people's models for what men and women are, growing up, is parents, teachers, and other authority figures, all of whom are tragically unhip.",1191009528

60794,comment,60321,60476,0,0,dfranke,,,"> how many Rails developers could track down CRuby bugs?<p>Probably a lot of them, if they tried.  Because Ruby is so poorly specified, I frequently read the interpreter source code to figure out how things are supposed to behave.  CRuby is really well-written in some ways and really poorly-written in others.  It's poorly written in the sense that it's a painfully slow line-by-line interpreter.  It's well written in the sense that the code is very clean and well-organized: I can usually find answers in the source faster than I can find answers in the pick-axe book.",1191008883

But, our economy being as robust as it is, surely there are very rich people who would sponsor random promising hackers to do whatever, instead of slaving away for 6 months -> year on one very specific and narrow problem domain.  <p>Our creative hacking, logical rigor, and awesome platform for idea modelling can have such a much more fundamental impact on society than all the web apps in the world.

It was nice knowing that the for loops I was writing would compile to the same for loops that the other guys were writing.<p>CoffeeScript currently makes up just over 1% of Airbnb's codebase. I expect that number to grow quite a bit over the next year.

An easier question is to ask ""What prompts a Lead 'Hat' stick with an idea though it doesn't seem to be the 'best' idea?""<p>Developers/designers using OP's two-way criticism style are really removing their own egos and emotions from the discussion and letting ideas honestly fight for themselves. I suspect that the Lead ""Hat"" is a conduit between developers/designers and executives and it's naturally difficult to convey, let alone objectively discuss corporate objectives in a development/design meeting.<p>The takeaway for Lead Hat lurkers on HN would be to (unfortunately) expose developers/designers to a wider scope of the project when the ideas are fighting, so they can understand where you're coming from.",1331063858

There are <i>a lot</i> of people that want to get into the US. <i>A lot</i>. I cannot emphasize that enough. The process has a lot of issues, but you have to understand why it got that way. The US's goal is to ensure that anybody who garners entry to live and work in the US is a contributing member of society. The three ways it does that is that (a) you have family here that are presumably productive members of society, (b) you have a set of skills that makes you a valuable asset to the US, or (c) you have a ton of money and can create jobs in the US. If you have only some money and average skills, you're not nearly as valuable as if you have either (b) or (c). Since the US has an incredible number of applicants, it only selects the best they can.<p>You wouldn't find it insane if colleges or employers made the same decisions.

One has to keep in mind that in China, citizens are not free to move about within the country as they please.

And just like we have here with Mexico and America, there are illegal immigrants from rural areas who live in secret in the urban areas, often working under inhumane conditions that they can't escape from without going to jail. The children of those who are officially rural residents are not permitted to enroll in urban schools, and thus forced to be separated from their parents and return to the parents' hometown to receive a formal education.<p>0: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system</a><p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system#Effect_on_rural_workers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system#Effect_on_rural_wo...</a>",1331063471

I know many colleagues of that author, other professors at the University of Minnesota, where I participate in the weekly journal club on human behavioral genetics. The key fact to note is that the author of the New York Times opinion piece is a child development psychologist, so his professional disciplinary point of view is that parent influence in early childhood counts for almost everything, and genes or nonparental environmental influences (including medical interventions) count for very little. But that's not what the best research shows about ADD/ADHD. There is good-quality evidence, especially gathered by Russell Barkley, who has conducted several of the better longitudinal studies, that prescribed medications can be helpful for many persons categorized as having ADD/ADHD. There is a lot of intentional fear, uncertainty, and doubt spread around about ADD/ADHD by persons who don't have legal authority to prescribe prescription medicines to patients, who fear losing business for their approaches if psychiatrists treat ADD patients.<p>Most people who have attention problems may be helped by a both-and approach of taking prescribed medicines along with lifestyle approaches like getting adequate sleep and outdoor exercise in daylight, learning organizational skills, hiring a secretary, or other helps. I've read some very striking personal testimonials from HN participants, full-time hacking programmers, who found that their personal productivity enormously increased when they started taking prescribed ADD medications as adults.

We may revisit that issue in a while. The short answer is that there can be bad academic effects, which show up in IQ test and achievement test scores, from delaying exposure to reading instruction and elementary mathematics instruction.

It's simply a discussion of what is right, and when.</i><p>How strict should this rule be? Where does it end, and where does legitimate criticism begin?<p>It is an illusion that people can simply talk about ""what is right and when"" without getting caught up in biases. Biases just get subtler and therefore more difficult to catch. Everyone who strongly favors one or another solution does so because they think it's the <i>right</i> solution, not merely because it's their favorite solution. You can't escape that by simply declaring that you're going to talk about what the right solution is. Meanwhile, people are often incapable of seeing all the shortcomings of their favorite idea, because it's their favorite idea. When that happens, you need other people to criticize it for you.<p>A rule that tells you to criticize your own idea and flaunt the benefits of other ideas could lead to suboptimal solutions when people try too hard to please one another and not all of the shortcomings are identified. What if you know that the other guy's solution will break down in an edge case that he seems to be totally oblivious of? The proposed rules of the discussion subtly discourages, if not prohibits, you from mentioning it until a later time when it might be too late. Of course you shouldn't be a hothead all the time. But if the only alternative is to express your discontent in a passive-aggressive, underhanded manner, how is that better than, for example, using Crocker's Rules [1] ?<p>But I guess it ultimately depends on the personalities of the people involved. If you've got a bunch of hotheads, maybe they really need to cool down and start thinking positively. But there are always some people who are really good at spotting problems but who are afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. You really don't want to discourage them any further.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sl4.org/crocker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sl4.org/crocker.html</a>",1331060768

Basically, they make everything open source, but they only promote the ""Google Chromium"", known to us as Chrome.<p>They should've done something similar from the beginning, because it's obvious Google wants a ""Google Experience Android"" to be separate than the Android that is accessible to anyone. If the projects had different names, it might've avoided some of the confusion about others using ""Android"" to make their own projects (like Amazon, B&N, and some Chinese companies).<p>Also, it would've forced manufacturers to keep it mostly the same (Would you get a Samsung branded Chrome?). But because they promoted Android instead of the ""Google Experience Android"", now they are coming out short in some ways, and manufacturers get to do almost whatever they want to Android. I'm not saying this is good or bad - just that it's bad for Google, and for their sake, it would've been better to use the Chrome/Chromium strategy.<p>Now they're trying to do this by renaming everything into ""Google X"" instead of using Android anymore. It might work, but it should've happened from the beginning, and it might be a bit confusing to do it right now.",1331060570

I love the RESULT of Obj-C+Cocoa Touch, you can achieve amazing user experience. But I'm reaching the point thinking: it's 2012, I'm an application developer, why am I spending half my time debugging memory leaks and concurrency issues? Java isn't much better either, why all this boiler plate, and still concurrency nightmares. I've done a handful of side projects with django and that's better, but I still think if I showed my teenage self what I'm programming in, he'd wonder if there was ever any real progress.<p>I guess what I'm saying is after all these years I want to work on a higher level, as a result I've started to play with Clojure and functional languages. Whether I'm idealizing functional/clojure life, I'll soon find out, but the appeal is very high to spend my time dealing with problem complexity, not language/framework ones.",1331060510

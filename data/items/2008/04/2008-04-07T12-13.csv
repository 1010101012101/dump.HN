156820,comment,156187,156248,0,0,Tichy,,,"Hm, that inspires me to another idea: maybe smoke signals could be revived, if they could be automatically picked up by weather satellites?<p>I wonder at what resolution and frequency the world is being scanned by satellites these days? I often wonder how to help people in war countries. For example Tibet at the moment: communication channels are being shut down, how could one provide people with simple means to get a message out to the world? Could smoke signals be a solution?<p>One problem is that I would not like the sender of the message to be detectable by the enemy. Not sure if that is solvable at all (certainly not with smoke signals).",1207573036

YUI vs. ""Atlas"" (is it still called Atlas) for example.  They get some good properties, but I think they are also looking for skills they apparently haven't had.<p>The question is, will they crush/warp/bend them or crush/warp/bend themselves?",1207572796

156811,comment,156804,156807,0,0,ideas101,,,"sorry, i didn't mentioned who are the shareholders? when m&a takes place its all about biggest shareholders who are mostly private equity or big venture funds and not the retail shareholders like you and me ... while customer and employees are located world over - for example a yahoo email user in a small village of china should also be considered as a value stakeholder because those type of users are in millions and in the same way an employee in the yahoo's r&d dept. in india is also as important as any other stakeholder.... so what would happen to ms if these 2 stakeholders switch their loyalty to the competitor (say google) after merger ???????",1207571421

I'm not sure that buying Yahoo! would make a great deal of difference to them either as I feel that Yahoo! is too big currently to be part of the next-phase.  I might be wrong though - it has been known once or twice before!!",1207571226

156806,comment,156804,156804,0,0,brk,,,"Well, I don't really use either of their products, so I don't have a strong feeling about the merger.<p>I think that the fall of Microsoft is eventual anyway, no company has historically maintained a strong dominance or monopoly in their industry over a long period of time.  As things continue to change in the computing market, Microsofts sheer size works more against it than for it.  We've all probably heard the story about how Microsoft almost missed the Internet in '95 or so.  That one was easier to recover from than sinking billions of R&D dollars into a desktop app development when things suddenly go to apps in the cloud, or some similar thing.<p>At this point, I don't know that Microsoft can really benefit from any significant merger.  They may however be able to fend off the inevitable for another few years with some strategic acquisitions though.",1207570561
156805,comment,156177,156250,0,0,azanar,,,"Perhaps induction and deduction? In any case, this is the basis behind economics as I understand it; taking data and then reasoning from there to more generalized models. Then those models can be used in future studies as a means to both reconcile the data, and to improve upon the models. There are several schools of thought, each with their own models, and each arguing that the other models are wrong due to particular reasons. This is not much unlike philosophy, except it deals with money instead of ethics and motivations.",1207570389

How far you can go if employees and customer are unhappy with the merger? which i think would be the case in this tussle of yahoo-ms merger ...",1207570047

Since we are uncomfortable with the truth's in adult literature  maybe this is why children's literature is now so popular with parents. Annie Dillard (in her autobiography, American Childhood, I think) wrote about this. When she was a kid she remembered wondering ""do adults know what's in these books they are telling us to read ?""<p>It's interesting that parents seem very sensitive to the contradiction of their lies in adult tv shows and movies but oblivious to the same problem in adult literature.

They have ruled that such an ""EULA"" violation is in fact copyright infringement as the game loads into your RAM and then you are modifying the ""experience"" of the game outside the realms of the Terms of Service, hence a copyright infringement.<p>If it is appealed, I think the decision will change. It's just way too wide of a scope. Under these definitions any virus protection program that scans the World of Warcraft client could be violating the EULA as it's 3rd party and also be subject of ""copyright infringement"". Interesting enough World of Warcraft provides an anti-cheating tool called Warden that scans your computer for known bots which in itself could be a copyright infringement if it is violating the EULA of let's say the bot program (Glider, who is being sued) if they say in it's own EULA that it's illegal to have any 3rd party tool scan it.",1216246997

This is what we need as a community to improve: use cases, and useful criticisms when things don't work well, so that we can find new strategies.<p>It's cool to see that Redis works well for many things, but it will be even cooler if diskstore, or any other approach, can made Redis more accessible even when the performance gain of being in-RAM is not enough for some kind of applications to justify the costs.<p>We are also working at cluster and faster .rdb persistence. So there are interesting things going, but fortunately we will have something new and stable in a few hours, as 2.2.0 stable is going live in very little time :)",1298325591

Try, catch, finally blocks are commonly used to ensure that resources are released once they are no longer used. It not only forces you to remember to close the resources, it also forces you to think about what happens if something in your code breaks, and you have these open resources still in use. It's practically the entire reason that the ""finally"" block exists.",1298325439

We have always regarded you and your ilk as an assembly of graceless sociopaths and maniacal chauvinists & religious zealots, however benign, who act out for the sake of attention & in the name of religion.<p>Being such aggressive proponents for the Freedom of Speech & Freedom of Information as we are, we have hitherto allowed you to continue preaching your benighted gospel of hatred and your theatrical exhibitions of, not only your fascist views, but your utter lack of Christ-like attributes. You have condemned the men and women who serve, fight, and perish in the armed forces of your nation; you have prayed for and celebrated the deaths of young children, who are without fault; you have stood outside the United States National Holocaust Museum, condemning the men, women, and children who, despite their innocence, were annihilated by a tyrannical embodiment of fascism and unsubstantiated repugnance. Rather than allowing the deceased some degree of peace and respect, you instead choose to torment, harass, and assault those who grieve.<p>Your demonstrations and your unrelenting cascade of disparaging slurs, unfounded judgments, and prejudicial innuendos, which apparently apply to every individual numbered amongst the race of Man - except for yourselves - has frequently crossed the line which separates Freedom of Speech from deliberately utilizing the same tactics and methods of intimidation and mental & emotional abuse that have been previously exploited and employed by tyrants and dictators, fascists and terrorist organizations throughout history.<p>ANONYMOUS cannot abide this behavior any longer.

2247388,comment,2247001,2247001,0,0,mindcrime,,,"A combination of ways, spread over many years.  And I'm not done learning, so there almost isn't an answer to this question.  But to try to hit the highpoints:<p>1. I bought a copy of Herbert Schildt's ""Teach Yourself C"" about 1993/1994 or so.  Downloaded a shareware C compiler from a BBS and just started writing code.<p>2. Bought more books on C, C++.  Upgraded to Borland Turbo C++ and started writing C++ code.  Toyed with writing hobby projects like a D&D character generator, but mostly just worked through examples in the books.<p>3. Took an ""intro to programming logic"" class in college.<p>4. Graduated from the community college and transferred to UNC-W as a CS major.  Took ""Intro to Pascal Programming"" and ""Intro to C Programming"" and an Assembler course during my first semester or two.<p>5. Kept studying C and C++ in my spare time, even after dropping out of school.  Started dabbling with different libraries like OWL and MFC.  Learned some Borland Paradox.<p>6. Dabbled a bit with other languages for kicks... downloaded freeware or open-source compilers and did at least ""hello, world"" in all sorts of obscure languages.<p>7. Went back to the community college to do a degree in computer programming.  Took two semesters of C++ and two semesters of RPG/400 plus some other interesting stuff.<p>7.5 about 1998 or so, started dabbling with Java just a little, but wasn't sold on it.<p>8. By 2000 I was a modestly competent C/C++ programmer, but with no real world experience and no undergrad degree.  But thanks to the dot-com bubble, I was able to get a job as a programmer anyway, once I left the confines of Hicksville and moved to the RTP area.<p>9. Spent a year or two doing mostly C and C++ and Visual Basic development.  Transferred to a different community college to finish the A.S degree I'd dropped out of to move to RTP in 2000.   Took two semesters of Java, a semester long class on Enterprise Java, a semester long class on JMS,  two semesters of Visual Basic, two semesters of Oracle Pl/SQL and some other stuff I forget now.<p>9.5 By now I'm writing Java almost exclusively at my day job, developing web-based e-commerce systems.<p>10. Graduated, went back to that same school to do an A.S. in High Performance Computing.  Started my first open source project somewhere in this timeframe.  Took 3-4 semesters of classes on MPI programming, OpenMP programming, HPC security, Beowulf Cluster building, an Operating Systems class, etc.<p>11. graduated, kept working mostly in Java.  Have worked mostly in Java ever since, with the exception of a stint at Lulu where I wrote mostly PHP and Python.<p>12. Started another open source project somewhere back around 2006.   Mixed in with all of this going back to the late 90's, BTW, is an interest and association with open-source, including building Mozilla (Mozilla, mind you, not Firefox) from source and reading over it's source, trying to understand it.  Tinkered with OpenOffice and some other random crap here and there as well.<p>12.5 Gave some talks on various topics at the local Java User's Group, Linux User's Group, etc.<p>13. About a year ago, launched the open-source project that I'm hoping to build a startup around.  This time it's built in Groovy and I'm moving more and more towards Groovy, while still writing Java at my $DAYJOB.<p>14. Organize the TriJVM Hack Night meetup, where various people get together to hack on various ""stuff"" in any of the many JVM languages.  I usually use the Hack Nights as an opportunity to spend a couple of hours working on Scala or Clojure.  I'm really starting to get into Clojure.<p>15. Started writing overly long and detailed answers to questions on HN when I could be coding.  Shame on me.<p>As far as books go, there have been many over the years, but I always got a lot of mileage out of those ""Dietel and Dietel"" books.  People seem to either love those or hate them, but they seemed pretty good to me.  Bruce Eckel's ""Thinking in C++"" was a good one as well.  The Robert Sedgewick books are good for algorithms stuff.  I own a copy of SICP, but still haven't gotten around to working through it.  But I will, one day... yes, one day I will.  After that I'll tackle TAOCP (if I live long enough!)<p>There are all sorts of opportunities and avenues to learn, so just take advantage.  I also forgot to mention going to Users Group meetings (as an attendee) and I learned a lot from many Tri-JUG meetings or Tri-LUG meetings (among others.)   And of course there are tons of videos and great lectures up on on Youtube and other sites.  Lately I've been going through that Stanford/Google one on Data Mining and reading the Head First Statistics book.<p>If there's a point to all this, I'd say it's ""Just keep learning.""",1298325246

Margins on hardware are generally razor thin but having 8 different support contracts with 6 different suppliers is a potential logistical nightmare for a company.

It might, but it's by no means certain. The long-term alternative for them is failure in the marketplace.<p>Signs of things turning around for Adobe will be when they:
> Make HTML5 the primary target for all Adobe software (make authoring for Flash not the default).
> Dump Air.
> Make the new Acrobat a slim wrapper around HTML5, facilitating a transition away from Acrobat toward standards.
> Stop trying to be cross-platform. Use native UI in all software. Dump the installer on platforms where installers aren't standard (Mac OS X).

Oy.<p>keep_if is the truly maddening WTF eye-bleeding rage-inducing make-a-normally-calm-rubyist-very-stabby one.<p>First off, it's a mutator but the name doesn't end in a bang. It should be keep_if! but for some random reason isn't. Yet another example of how the pleasant idea of using question marks for bool-returning methods (file.exists?) and exclamations for mutators (file.delete!) is just that -- a neat idea (very!) inconsistently applied and thus pointless. Ruby should use method punctuations consistently or get rid of them, for heaven's sake.<p>keep_if is also egregious because it is the THIRD verb for doing basically the same thing. We already had find_all and select (synonyms) and now select! and, presumably, find_all!. So your  workaday ruby coder gets to pick between find_all, select and keep_if to pick items out of an array based on truthiness of a callback. He gets to figure out which two are true synonymous and which is a near-synonym , and then wonder/research why you would ever want to use the near synonym.<p>Which brings us to the third reason keep_all is egregious, which is that brings very, very little to the table. It is just like select! except it always returns the object, whereas select! returns the object <i>except</i> when no changes are made, in which case it returns nil. In this regard select! behaves like your other ruby mutators (string.sub! and string.gsub!, for example). Now this behavior, which keep_if was invented to circumvent, can be annoying in a very narrow range of circumstances, for example when you stick a mutator on a var  at the end of a method and take it for granted that it will always return the thing it's mutating, as your return value, until one day your method is randomly returning nil and you have to delete a <i>single character</i> from your method to fix this. But 99/100 times the whole reason you are using a mutator is that you don't care about the return value just the side effect (the mutation); if you cared about the rv you would just use the non mutator.<p>So keep_if is ""fixing"" a ""problem"" with an extremely minor scope and with an extremely easy programmer fix.<p>Also, keep_if is a one off.<p>In other words:<p>If it's problematic that mutators in ruby return nil on non mutation, then the Correct Solution, i.e. the non aneurism inducing one,  is either to change how ALL mutators work, say in 2.0, or to invent some kind of new standard alternate syntax like say a double bang or something. Because there are a LOT of mutators that work the way select! works.<p>The way NOT to fix this (supposed) mutator problem is to invent a one off solution for one particular type of mutator, a solution that invents /a whole different name/ for the method it is altering, thus setting the precedent of sprawling the language. By the apparent reasoning behind keep_if we now need something called like, oh I don't know, ""rewrite_all"" to similarly be like-but-not-quite-like ""gsub!"". And ""rewrite"" to do same for ""sub!"", and so on and so on for the other mutators until ruby is getting nearly as bloated and unreadable as.... Perl. (Which I love and used to code in but, let's face it, has some mmmmmhowdoyousay -- issues? -- with readability.)<p>So keep_if is a one-off inelegant language bloating solution to a non problem. That's egregiousness three.<p>Egregiousness four is that keep_if was introduced <i>at the same time</i> as the thing it was invented to fix -- the (apparently sometimes) undesirable behavior of select!. select! was introduced.... at the same time as keep_if. Ugh. Facepalm.<p>So it's not like I'm going to stop using ruby or anything, and it's not like anyone would care if I did, but I am going to have disagree with you a little here about these new methods being ""lovely,"" in the sense that methods that will eventually send ruby spiralling into, at best, a /near brush/ with morbid, Perl-esque language obesity are not ""lovely"" /in my humble opinion./<p>Anyway sorry for the rant!

My wife had a pretty bad bout of anxiety / depression that pretty much tanked two years until I convinced her to try some medication - a year of it helped get her over the edge, and she's off and doing much better.<p>Now I'll proceed to shoot somewhere near my foot, maybe hitting it :)  I'd rather be understood and disagreed with than misunderstood and have fake happiness.  And I would honestly be curious what your take is on this, I obviously haven't experienced everything there is in the world.  There's no hard feelings here, I've seen that stance before, and I hate it too.  It does indeed prevent people from getting help.<p>My main view with anything that tweaks your brain is that your brain is enormously flexible.  Barring issues where you're not making enough / too much of a certain chemical (ie, largely genetic), you quite literally did this to yourself (as bad as that sounds).  Your life habits have caused you to get stuck in the loop of depression / anxiety, and it builds on itself, pretty frequently until it controls you unless you are lucky enough to find a way to break out before then.  Or someone drags you out.  Drugs help get you out of that loop, but if your habits don't change you'll train your brain to go back to where it was in spite of the drugs (and this <i>happens</i>, it's not just dualism / zomg-natural-only.  That's part of what causes psychological addictions, and depression is highly addictive).  Again, unless there's a more permanent biological problem - then you're using drugs to reach normalcy, which is where your body / brain wants to be anyway.  But enforced normalcy while you keep pulling yourself away from it is doomed to failure and high costs.<p>There are plenty of cases of, say, insufficient dopamine production due to genetics.  And cases where depression / anxiety have caused chemical imbalances (ie: nearly all, especially severe cases).  And the existence of medications to help that is utterly <i>wonderful</i>.  But using drugs to ignore a problem isn't a solution.  To <i>solve</i> a problem, yes, but that's not how many (possibly most) people use them, in part because of how quickly these medications are leapt at.  Can't focus?  Try hyperactivity drugs.  Can't sleep?  Try sleep aids.  Can't be happy?  Try antidepressants.  Therapy, on the other hand, gets nowhere near as much medical support, despite similar success rates and often longer-term solutions.  It has plenty of failures as well, everyone's different and there are plenty of bad therapists out there; I'm merely saying that it gets <i>far</i> less <i>support</i> than drugs do.",1298324899

Consider lowering your rate for continued access to services like health insurance or retirement plans.<p>Decline any financial compensation related to performance, only go for a fixed fee, else you may find yourself distracted or side tracked and working extra hours that you never intended to, to achieve some financial goal or project closure.

In general, this is sqrt(N) floors, spaced sqrt(N) floors apart.
The bulb will break at floor sqrt(N) * X [10X in this example]. Now, drop the bulb from the approximately sqrt(N) [10] floors between floor sqrt(N) * (X-1) [10 * (X-1)] and sqrt(N)* X - 1 [10 * X - 1], inclusive. When it breaks, you have the exact tolerance rounded down to the nearest floor, and you've done it with at worst 2 * sqrt(N) drops.<p>By the way, this is a great example of a dumb interview question; it's not particularly obvious that there is a solution in sqrt(N) worst case time, but once you're told that there is one (and, perhaps, that binary search + linear search is linear search in the worst case), it's not too difficult to get it in sqrt(N).<p>Also, note that average case running time analysis is meaningless if you don't have a distribution for the input; simply assuming that the tolerance is distributed uniformly at random from 1 to 100 just because you have a 100-floor building makes little sense.",1298322925

I'm pretty sure every teenager smart enough to do so knows it's wrong to hack into a company's network, download their corporate secrets and distribute them to the internet.<p>Deterrance is absolutely the point of punishment.  What he did was a white-collar crime.  There's a perception in society that you can get away with certain extremely harmful things, like hacking or financial crime or environmental pollution, because it's hard to pin down intent and the results are hard to measure.<p>* Mugging.

Likewise, my views on Quebecois vs. Acadians are taken from an Acadian friend who had moved to Montreal, and whose coworkers refused outright to speak French to her because they didn't want to listen to her accent.<p>Put another way: I've never met someone from France who didn't speak ill of Quebecois French when asked, and I've never met an Acadian who felt entirely welcomed in Montreal.

2247158,comment,2246044,2246044,0,0,balloot,,,"I disagree with the assertion that solving a coding question on a whiteboard is equivalent to asking a surgeon what a scalpel is.  The equivalent for an engineer would be asking what an if statement is.  Both are simple tools that are used for your job, and interviews should assume you know what they are.<p>The real equivalent for a surgeon would be to give him a theoretical case of a patient and then ask him to explain how he would solve it.  I'm not a surgeon so I have no clue what their interviews are really like, but asking a question like this would seem like a very reasonable thing to do.<p>As for the guy in the article who whines about employers stubbornly wanting someone who has written code sometime recently, I'm not quite sure why he'd think otherwise.  When you hire someone at a PhD's salary you generally don't expect to have to hold their hand for a few months as they get back into learning how to write code.  Not to mention anyone I know who is good at writing code writes code for fun in their free time.  Would you hire an artist who has a Fine Art degree but hasn't actually drawn anything for years?  I think not.",1298322136

Even at that time it was clear that playing in someone else's yard meant playing by their rules, and that it was highly likely that I wasn't going to like their rules. I decided to not make an app. Simple decision really.<p>A lot of developers are now complaining that they're getting burned by what is a reasonably obvious profit motive from Apple. They're not offering an app store because they're good guys. They're offering an app store to make money.<p>They take 30% of purchases. It only makes sense to take 30% of in-app purchases and related subscription services as well. Did anyone honestly believe that apple would fall for the ebay $0.90 purchase with $90 shipping fee-dodging trick? Letting subs through just opens the door for people to ship free apps with subscription ""unlocks"", thus cutting out Apple.<p>The simple fact is that Apple owns the mountain, and if you want to mine their gold you can expect to pay their taxes.<p>Of course the simple solution is to just build a web app (as these guys have done). Why restrict yourself to Apple's yard and Apple's rules when you can target every device without rules, without restrictions and without a 30% tax?

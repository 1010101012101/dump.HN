I have seen a few mentions of the site here and there, some good, some bad.  It looks like a fairly good source of information for unix tools and C programming, if a little dated. So I decided to ask here.  What do you think about this site?  What's good, what's bad?",1251510835

792647,comment,791762,792589,0,0,spc476,,,"In assembly, a design code would be (and here I'm using the Intel 8086 as an example) pass pointers to structures in BX, pointers to strings (or arrays) in SI, CX will contain sizes or limits, DI will point to destinations (say, copying something, or accepting input) with AX and DX used for anything else.  Returning data---carry flag clear means success, if set, AX will contain an error code.  Other registers may be updated depending upon the function.<p>That's a design code in Assembly.  Move to a Motorola 68000, and well, it changes somewhat---pointers are passed in A0-A5, other data in D0-D7.  You can still use the carry flag and say, D0 for error codes.<p>Move up to C, and the details about passing parameters to a function go away (unless you are mixing Assembly with C, and even then it can be isolated).  I just give the parameters to the function and it's up to the compiler to stuff them into proper registers or on the stack or how ever it's done on a particular architecture.<p>Now, object oriented programming in C---another design pattern.  Declare a structure with pointers to functions, and always pass the pointer to the structure to functions called via the function pointers.  Again, the programmer is aware of the details.  IN C++, the compiler handles those details.",1251510553

To verify a password, look up the user's salt value, compute K' = scrypt(salt, password'), and compare K' to K.<p>You don't need this much strength, but as a matter of course I would recommend using a 256-bit salt and a 256-bit output from scrypt -- the reasoning being that using 256 bits isn't going to be a performance-limiting factor, and that if you try to figure out exactly how many bits you need, there's a risk that you'll make a mistake.<p>If you can't use scrypt, I'd recommend PBKDF2-SHA256; if that's also unavailable, use bcrypt.",1251509726

This means people whose use of a machine consists, at least 90% of the time, of basic things like a web browser, command-line terminal and/or SSH, an IM client, an MP3 player, maybe an IDE, and so on.  It seems to me that if they wanted pretty aesthetics they could do a contemporary Linux desktop environment and reap the benefits, but they insist that their productivity is greatly enhanced by Mac's basic UI features and the sort of environmental/ecosystem integration to which you allude.

After graduating, he became involved with a folk music group called ""La Gueule du loup"", playing the accordion andharmonica. His work on the folk music scene was what introduced him to the art of street performance. After quitting college, Laliberté toured Europe as a folk musician and busker. He had learned the art of fire breathing by the time he returned home to Quebec in 1979. Although he became employed at a hydroelectric power plant in James Bay, his job ended after only three days due to a labour strike. Supported by his unemployment insurance, he decided not to look for another job. Instead, he joined the stilt-walking troupe ""Les Échassiers de Baie-Saint-Paul"" that was led by Gilles Ste-Croix. Shortly afterward, Laliberté and Ste-Croix organized a summer fair in Baie-Saint-Paul with the help of Laliberté's soon-to-be business partner Daniel Gauthier.[4][5]\nThis festival, called the ""La Fête Foraine"", first took place in July 1982 touring Quebec. Ironically, the event was barred from its host town shortly thereafter because of complaints by local citizens. Laliberté managed and produced the fair over the next couple years, nurturing it into a moderate financial success.[4] But it was during 1983 that the government of Quebec gave him a 1.5 million dollar grant to host a production the following year as part of Quebec's 450th anniversary celebration of the French explorer Jacques Cartier's discovery of Canada. Laliberté named his creation ""Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil.""[6][7] The celebration turned out to be a critical and commercial success. Although the first tour of Cirque only netted a forty-thousand dollar profit, it allowed him to sign almost 1.5 million dollars in contracts. They had been performing exclusively for Canadian audiences until 1987 when Laliberté risked everything and took his circus to the Los Angeles Arts Festival. It cost the production's entire cash reserve to make the move. Had it not been successful, he would not have had the money to move the troupe back home to Québec.[8]<p>In Today's News\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/10/11/space.clown.lands/index.html<p>Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte, sporting a foam clown nose, landed back on Earth after a $35 million working vacation at the international space station.<p>Guy Laliberte, wearing a foam clown nose, smiles after landing Sunday in Kazakhstan.",1255328683

Literature that does that is no less sadist than worlds that do.  But literature that includes pain is not generally evidence of sadism, and neither are worlds.  What you can say about the creator's character is entirely driven by what you can say about his purpose.<p>A simple motivating example: I spent a while undergoing some martial arts training, and at times it <i>was</i> painful.  Injuries weren't intended, but could the class have possibly been conducted with a little more deference to my sore feet, with perhaps one less bruise here or there?<p>In a philosophical sense, of course it could have.  But this is not evidence of sadism on the part of the instructor (or the fellow students who gave me such a beating).

And it doesn't hurt that you're smart as well :-)<p>You might need to water-down the technical jargon with descriptive sentences. The biggest hassle I still face today is users who are uneducated about online advertising. E.g:<p><i>BEHAVIORAL TARGETING showing your ads only to interested users, based on their previous behavior.</i><p><i>A/B Split-testing and Multivariate testing allows you to run multiple ads on small segment, and then run the highest performing ads on the rest of your user-base.</i><p>So on and so forth.<p>Most of your upcoming work will be on educating the users 1/2 the time, and sourcing clients on the other half.<p>Good luck.",1255327597

Haskell certainly has one!<p>The key is that given the same input you need to produce the same output every time.  Which is great as long as you're not doing I/O.  (Haskell addresses that with monads - even though it looks like you're giving the same input, you're really giving a different input each time!)",1255327526

876150,comment,875642,875642,0,0,Darmani,,,"This page looks like it gives a very nice introduction to ""programming"" in the pure-untyped lambda calculus. But reading this, one would have no idea that a ""meatier"" side to lambda calculus existed. Just understanding the Church-Rosser theorem and its consequences, for example, would give a far deeper understanding than anything shown here. One thing that saddens me is that it shows construction of the combinators used to compute partial-recursive functions, but makes no discussion of the significance of this (the partial-recursive functions are an important computational class, and this is essentially a proof that they're lambda computable. Throw in a 6th type of combinator, and you've just proved lambda calculus capable of emulating one of the major models of computation).<p>It's certainly cool, but there's only so much to be gained from knowing that you can implement the factorial function with (λf .(λx .f (xx ))(λx .f (xx ))) (λfn.((λn.n(λu.λxy .y )(λxy .x ))n)(λfx .fx ) \n((λmnf .m(nf ))n(f ((λnfx .n(λgh.h(gf ))(λu.x )(λu.u))n)))) .",1255327464

The school kept having soda and vending machines disappear periodically.  It turned out that guys from the local tribe were taking the <i>entire</i> machines back to the reservation in their trucks, using them until they were empty, and then lugging them back to be refilled.  I'm not sure what method they were using to get the soda out without paying, but they finally caught some of the guys using video cameras.  I think it was all done more for the excitement than the soda...and also maybe to make a statement of some kind.  (I can't imagine hauling one of those big machines around for the soda it would hold.)",1255327463

I only sketched an answer to what I took to be the article's broad point--that the cruelty and conflict in nature don't look like the work of the Christian God.  Mostly, I was making a smaller point: atheists often see ironclad, unresolvable contradictions where Christians see merely interesting questions--or trivial questions, or even no puzzle at all.<p>It is a simple case of confirmation bias, I think.  An atheist does not expect Christianity to make sense, so when he runs across something counterintuitive, he is very quick to conclude it is a simple mistake.  This is unfortunate; a bit of dialogue with Christian intellectuals would likely enrich him with ideas he would otherwise find alien.<p>As a conoisseur of ideas, I have been tremendously enriched by serious dialogues with those of opposing views.  The prejudices and biases are different.  Even if we disagree on foundations, this leads them to say things I would not think of, to ask questions I would never have raised, to point out flaws in reasoning I think straightforward.",1255327395

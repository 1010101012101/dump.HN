The tech media is pathetic and the same publication ""exposing"" this unfortunate waste of space (who wouldn't have been able to pull the wool over the eyes of any company that had the self confidence to reference check instead of jumping on every potential hire who can name drop) is largely responsible for the phony tech-celeb culture that's invaded the valley in recent years.<p>It's a serious business what we do here in Silicon Valley.  Sure we can enjoy our work, but most of us are committing our lives and livelihoods to working hard at what we do.  The trivial nature of the media covering the tech industry right now, the desperate need for people to feel they have some sort of celebrity cachet because of what we do, and the  fact that too many people watched the Social Network and want to pretend that's their life, is just a sorry state of affairs.<p>Word gets around about people like this.  It's really not necessary to post an article on TechCrunch like you're exposing some mastermind criminal.  Well I suppose it is if the generation of journalists currently staffing the tech press is really just taking umbrage that someone else with scant qualifications wants to run around the valley acting like they are somebody when they've not created anything themselves.<p>Yeah, this article just reminds me of the sorry state of media coverage of our industry.",1346222644

If you think it's a lack of ""balls"" keeping others from catering to your niche, do it yourself. But rather, I think that you're not giving people enough credit. Why would they cater to <i>you</i> when they can cater to people with lesser expectations and freer, larger-in-aggregate wallets?<p>It's not that there isn't a market. It's that that market is very high-maintenance and, if you look at other similar products, probably extremely difficult to effectively monetize. Targeting users who come with the twin attributes of being touchy and quick to leave <i>and</i> are probably unresponsive to advertising and other straightforward ""you don't pay"" models does not strike me as a brilliant decision. The success stories in the described niche--Tarsnap comes to mind--seem mostly to be very small businesses or strange attempts at capturing the zeitgeist a la App.net. (Tarsnap being a small business isn't an inherent negative; I personally have little use for the ""startup startup startup, business plans optional"" silliness that seems to be infecting the tech sector and cperciva has built a great product. But you're not complaining about Dropbox, you're complaining about Quora and Facebook, which have very different business needs.)<p>.<p>Or, put another, admittedly more cynical way: I don't know many people who want to cater to a market segment that will hate them as soon as they start needing to find ways to make payroll. Some people price themselves into or out of a market segment. You behave yourself out of what have heretofore been economically viable ones. Which is totally fine if that's your bag, but following that up with complaints that people who want to make money aren't interested in catering you is...curious.<p>There are generally easier ways to make money than to build low-barrier-to-departure services for demanding, temperamental people.

The argument for casting was that could make porting to C++ easier.  The argument against it went like that (hope I'm not botching it): if the appropriate header file was not included and consequently malloc() was implicitly assumed to return an int, then without a cast assigning the return value of malloc to say char* would likely trigger a warning, but the cast will silence the warning.

Organizations who have IT teams are fully capable of implementing reasonable APIs like what Duo or Google offers. But you'll realize that enterprises don't even care about the architecture, because they'll be paying you to implement it anyway.<p>No, the reason nobody (in and only in the US) uses 2FA (because nearly every other country in the world uses it widely) is because it's a pain to use for the end user. No enterprise is going to invest their time and energy into a solution unless they're either required to by regulations or is truly better, easier, more secure, or whatever than competing solutions to make it a compelling sale.<p>If this were a hobby project then I'd be cheering you on -- why not make a token 2FA with a slightly better API?

Were you expecting rocket science?<p>The best parts of heritage come from doing the right thing. And doing the right thing is often hard and stark. Today is one of those junctures.<p>Heritage is not just historic, its being built right now. Your heritage today includes a grand ability to argue, and to mistake articulation for action. You didn't come across as someone who wanted to leave it at that.<p>Re: mysticism.<p>> I believed a relation between me and god is personal, and priests, temples, rituals have no business being there. Eventually, I became an atheist.<p>AFAIK, the personal, as opposed to institution driven, connection to 'God' lands under the penumbra of mysticism.<p>I am glad you have those answers, but those are your personal answers.<p>The answer to your question i.e. common heritage, is linked to 'Indian' history, which in turn is inextricably linked to religion.<p>For example : When the Mughals first came here, (and ironically displaced the previous Nawabs), they said that they found so many things different between the cultures that they could never foresee common ground being reached.<p>It was when the Sufi saints came though, and discussed their take on religion, that they found a lot in common with the cultures already here.<p>>  I am saying it isn't and there isn't an authority which decides the Indian heritage.<p>I am not providing authority, I am providing history. You had a question, you got an answer. If you want your answer to be something else, well read through Indian history.<p>If anything, the history of India gives space for almost everything, be it a Fakir who wants to be close to gods by being close to the ashes of the departed, or someone who is an atheist and appreciates the logic of code.<p>----<p>Your final para is about having normal standards to deal with people. Its a great system, stick to it. But again, your question was about heritage not common sense behavior.<p>----<p>I am not sure what you were aiming for in your response. You've been able to point out that India is very diverse, which I agree. I am pointing out as well, that the way that melting pot was bound together was often through mysticism.<p>----<p>Here,<p>The west had its progression from the Greek states, their fall, the dark ages, the renissance, the enlightenment, the reformation, along the way including things like the french revolution, women's suffrage and civil liberties.<p>India followed another path altogether.

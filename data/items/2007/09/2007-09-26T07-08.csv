For what I normally calculate, Google is fine and I use a TI-89 if I need to solve anything symbolic. Mathematica is significantly harder to use than either of those for me.<p>And instead of a Bugatti Veyron, I'd get two Tesla Roadsters and buy ten more for friends or as company cars for employees.",1190793426

59752,story,,,9,6,imperator,"Idea: Competitive Microblogging",,"I have this idea for a website where you can craft competitions around goals you want to achieve.<p>For example, if you want to eat healthy, you set up a competition for eating healthy and invite your friends to it. Then you log your meals with them. It keeps you objective and focused because you want to look good to your friends and perhaps best them.<p>This idea isn't relegated to one thing, any goal you wish to achieve you can set up a competition around.<p>The inspiration for this came from reading PG's essay on ""How Not to Die."" This paragraph kept harassing me.<p>""You've probably noticed that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every dinner is a mini Demo Day. Every dinner is a kind of a deadline. So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will push you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll be embarrassed to tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last time we talked.""<p>The idea of using others as objective markers for your progress isn't new, but I don't think it's really been digitized.<p>I'm going to apply to Ycombinator with this idea, so if there's anyone who wants to come in on it as my partner, please email me at primevector@gmail.com.<p>The other point of this post is to see what people think. The comments here are always thoughtful, so please, do tell.",1190790887

It's a bit paradoxical, the generalaties become clear only in a more specific presentation; it requires a lovely balance, and few can manage. That's what makes it all the more intresting I guess. I think this is one of your finest essays.

However, companies often use indicators that are of dubious predictive power (things where one can&#x27;t show a significant correlation with the bad outcome the company wants to avoid, but show a strong correlation with a protected class).</i><p>This is done in a LOT of machine learning settings - the vast majority of variables used in classification/regression scenarios fall into this category. Most machine learning consists of turning a large number of nearly insignificant correlations into a single big correlation.<p>Consider category A, which has features x[i] located in the ball of radius 100 around the point [0,0,...,0] in N dimensional space. Category B has features x[i] located in the ball of radius 100 around the point [1,1,...,1]. Any individual feature is useless - if it&#x27;s from category A, it&#x27;ll be located in [-100,100], whereas if it&#x27;s from category B it&#x27;ll be located in [-99,101].<p>On the other hand, the classifier sum(x) works perfectly for N > 100. That&#x27;s because in N dimensions, the distance between [0,0,...,0] and [1,1,...,1] is sqrt(N) (proof: use the pythagorean theorem).<p>That&#x27;s an oversimplified example, but I hope it illustrates the point.<p>It&#x27;s a bit scary that the FTC wants to start regulating feature engineering.

8425373,comment,8424696,8425332,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"We&#x27;ve gone in a security model that Bruce Schneier calls Digital Feudalism. We give up rights to have large centralized organizations take care of our security for us. In exchange we give them data that they are allowed to sell. This is both for devices and for services (notably Web 2.0).<p>There are arguably benefits to this arrangement. Prostitutes have pimps, even though they cut into profits without taking much personal risk or providing much labor, because pimps do provide a safety mechanism. Likewise, vassals gave up large portions of what they produced for security from their lords  and kings.<p>We&#x27;ve returned to this arrangement because:<p>1.) Paying is painful and copying software is easy. Instead of making money from you, Web 2.0 have monetized you as a target for advertisers. Web services are &#x27;in&#x27; because that&#x27;s the only way software can&#x27;t be pirated. Much of our software today displays GUIs on a screen but runs on other computers because of this reason. The new Office products all run in the cloud, MMOs offer the same deal, and games like Diablo III can only run when in constant connection to the internet, even though there&#x27;s no technical reason why that should be the case. XBox One tried to (and backpedaled from) make the xBox always on always connected. Other streaming video game and content services try the same. Essentially, the internet has become glorified TV (minimally interactive), with more channels.<p>2.) The internet is the Wild Wild West. Security professionals have been yelling for ages that the rush to release and the need to compete together with closed source development was making the world an insecure place. Essentially every layer of our computing stack is insecure. Attestation of computer intrusion is ridiculously hard. And there&#x27;s money (and geopolitical power) to be had. We designed things insecure from the start, and continue to do so. Individuals <i></i>can&#x27;t<i></i> stay secure on their own. It&#x27;s not possible.

If it is enforced, the 90-day cap should be enough to keep apartments from being taken off the market during a housing crisis so they can be used as full-time hotels. That is really important, because it is the more affordable apartments that are most vulnerable to this, since they don&#x27;t usually have a doorman or a landlord that is likely to care that much.<p>The problem it doesn&#x27;t solve, however, is the fact that hotel guests shouldn&#x27;t be staying in apartment buildings unattended by a host anyway. It creates terrible problems for people who are actually trying to live there, since Airbnb guests will treat your building like a hotel.

8425318,comment,8423825,8425202,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Vectorization shifts the performance tradeoffs in the storage model. As a practical matter, users design their applications around the performance tradeoffs of database engines, so you really can&#x27;t change your storage model without alienating users.<p>There are roughly four different storage models in databases, with their own acronyms: NSM (pure row structured storage), DSM (sorted columnar structured storage), PAX (like DSM but where a row is stored within a single page), VSM (array structured individual columns where every element in a row has the same index). PAX and VSM are hybrid storage models. All four are used in real commercial systems. Vector storage models (VSM) are extremely good for real-time workloads; they sacrifice a little bit of insert performance for a major improvement in query performance relative to NSM, but their insert/append performance is much better than DSM or (to a lesser extent) PAX.<p>The reason vector models are extremely efficient in terms of query processing boil down to a few facts. First, a column can be streamed into the CPU as a sequential memory scan, which is very efficient. Second, constraints on multiple columns can be trivially parallelized. Third, searches across multiple columns/attributes can usually be constructed as a bitmap per column, and then composed as simple AND/OR operations over those bitmaps, which is extremely fast. Fourth, individual columns in this model are amenable to the use of vector instructions for evaluation in the CPU, saving even more clock cycles.<p>There is no ideal storage model, it really depends on the workload. Some sophisticated databases will change the storage model to adapt to the likely access patterns, such as NSM (great for a page with a lot of inserts) to PAX or VSM (great for queries when a page is unlikely to change much).",1412742586

If you produce high quality science on a consistent, constant basis ... trust me, you&#x27;ll get the big $$$.<p>But if you get lucky because you stumbled on something great, that&#x27;s not science. That&#x27;s winning the lottery. And you didn&#x27;t win the lottery, your employer did. Your employer knows it had nothing to do with you and had everything to do with luck.<p>If Lipitor guy had a convincing argument that he could have another $135b breakthrough, that he could be consistent, do you really think everybody would tell him to screw off? I bet they would easily lay half that amount at his feet.",1412740871

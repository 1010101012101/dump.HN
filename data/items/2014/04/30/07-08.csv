You should probably concentrate on learning enough programming to be dangerous.  This is possible with about 5~10 weeks of dedicated work (apparently, based on the experience of people whom I find credible reporting their experience hiring graduates of coding bootcamps) or in about a year or so of self-study by someone bright and motivated (I know numerous examples of this).  You&#x27;ll gain a lot in your first few years of work in terms of seasoning, going into more depth on some of the <i>many</i> subfields in every tech segment, rounding out your technical skills, and learning soft skills and other value enhancers, but you can do all of that learning while getting paid professional wages as opposed to paying for additional credentialing.<p>The combination of business skills -- even skills which strike you as so basic that they barely deserve the word &quot;skill&quot; -- plus the ability to program is an extraordinarily powerful one, by the way.

It just don&#x27;t fit.</i><p>Yup, I agree.  Functional languages failed in part because they modelled the machine poorly (Richard Gabriel has some reflections on Lisp in this area).<p>But the funny thing is that hardware has changed!  Imperative programming languages are now the square peg in the round hole :)<p>Multicore machines are going to elaborate lengths to maintain the illusion of a uniform address space.  But if we programmed with message passing and heterogeneous processes, then our programs would have more mechanical sympathy for the machine.<p>Shared memory and locks are basically the result of not wanting to disturb too much source code when converting from a single-threaded to a concurrent/parallel program.  But it results in poor performance and scalability, not to mention untestable and unmaintainable programs.  You can look at the evolution of multicore scalability in the Linux and FreeBSD kernels, or Python and Ruby GILs (coarse grained locks in a Turing machine model), for examples of this.<p>The other thing that has changed is that our hardware is distributed (not just clusters, but also client-server).  Networks are fundamentally unreliable, and that means that idempotency of subprograms is a very important property.  Idempotency is of course a word from the same area of mathematics that functional programming comes from (abstract algebra).<p>The other algebraic property that is important in distributed systems is commutativity.  This basically has to do with physics[1].  Commuter[2] is a nice project which addresses commutativity in interface design.<p>It&#x27;s not an accident that MapReduce and all the newer big data frameworks are based on the model of functional programming.  They are using the imperative model at the scale of a single machine, where its appropriate, but the functional model at the scale of the cluster, so subprograms can be retried and executed in any order.<p>The alternative to explicitly thinking about these properties in your program design is to (only) use slow state machine protocols like Paxos.  You could naively apply this transformation to your sequential programs, but you will be making very poor use of the hardware.  There is a reason that they are only used for very small bits of state in distributed systems.<p>tl;dr Distributed systems (multicore included) are not Turing machines.  I see a lot of bugs that are a result of people in the imperative mindset not understanding this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4892527405117123487&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&sciodt=0,5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=489252740511712348...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/commuter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/commuter/</a>",1398843973

Here are the texts:<p>1957\nI always wished to address this Assembly in Greek, but realized that it would have been indeed &quot;Greek&quot; to all present in this room. I found out, however, that I could make my address in Greek which would still be English to everybody. With your permission, Mr. Chairman, l shall do it now, using with the exception of articles and prepositions, only Greek words.<p>Kyrie, I eulogize the archons of the Panethnic Numismatic Thesaurus and the Ecumenical Trapeza for the orthodoxy of their axioms, methods and policies, although there is an episode of cacophony of the Trapeza with Hellas. With enthusiasm we dialogue and synagonize at the synods of our didymous organizations in which polymorphous economic ideas and dogmas are analyzed and synthesized. Our critical problems such as the numismatic plethora generate some agony and melancholy. This phenomenon is characteristic of our epoch. But, to my thesis, we have the dynamism to program therapeutic practices as a prophylaxis from chaos and catastrophe. In parallel, a Panethnic unhypocritical economic synergy and harmonization in a democratic climate is basic. I apologize for my eccentric monologue. I emphasize my euharistia to you, Kyrie to the eugenic and generous American Ethnos and to the organizers and protagonists of his Amphictyony and the gastronomic symposia.<p>1959[edit]\nKyrie, it is Zeus&#x27; anathema on our epoch for the dynamism of our economies and the heresy of our economic methods and policies that we should agonize the Scylla of numismatic plethora and the Charybdis of economic anaemia. It is not my idiosyncrasy to be ironic or sarcastic, but my diagnosis would be that politicians are rather cryptoplethorists. Although they emphatically stigmatize numismatic plethora, they energize it through their tactics and practices. Our policies have to be based more on economic and less on political criteria. Our gnomon has to be a metron between political, strategic and philanthropic scopes. Political magic has always been anti-economic. In an epoch characterized by monopolies, oligopolies, monopsonies, monopolistic antagonism and polymorphous inelasticities, our policies have to be more orthological. But this should not be metamorphosed into plethorophobia, which is endemic among academic economists. Numismatic symmetry should not hyper-antagonize economic acme. A greater harmonization between the practices of the economic and numismatic archons is basic. Parallel to this, we have to synchronize and harmonize more and more our economic and numismatic policies panethnically. These scopes are more practicable now, when the prognostics of the political and economic barometer are halcyonic. The history of our didymus organizations in this sphere has been didactic and their gnostic practices will always be a tonic to the polyonymous and idiomorphous ethnical economies. The genesis of the programmed organization will dynamize these policies. Therefore, I sympathize, although not without criticism on one or two themes, with the apostles and the hierarchy of our organs in their zeal to program orthodox economic and numismatic policies, although I have some logomachy with them. I apologize for having tyrannized you with my Hellenic phraseology. In my epilogue, I emphasize my eulogy to the philoxenous autochthons of this cosmopolitan metropolis and my encomium to you, Kyrie, and the stenographers.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon_Zolotas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon_Zolotas</a>",1398842549

It&#x27;s idiomatic, like using T for a type in C++ templates, argc and argv for the inputs to main in C, making the second returned value in a Go function the error and calling it err and not error or e or er or failed, using the type &quot;t&quot; in OCaml to specify &quot;the&quot; type a particular module is defining (I think...), or anything else. X, y and z in maths are idiomatic; there&#x27;s no good reason they&#x27;re used instead of a, b, c, or LR, UD, FB (left-right, up-down, front-back) for coordinates except that that&#x27;s what people are used to, and sticking to the convention makes code/equations easier to follow because your brain is used to seeing x used a certain way, so you don&#x27;t need to keep checking to see what it is when you see it in longer code/equations.<p>Many haskell functions operating on lists are described in terms of the first element &quot;x&quot; and the rest of the elements xs (exes or &quot;the rest of the x&#x27;s&quot;). It&#x27;s a common convention used because we have no idea what x might be, all we know is that, in this case, elements of the type that x is can be ordered. This means that one function works on lists of numbers, letters, string, lists of numbers, booleans, etc. Basically terse names like that are used because many haskell functions are very general. We could have decided on (hd:tl) or something, but there&#x27;s something nice about stating that there is one value x and some values which are also x&#x27;s.<p>You have to remember these are not features of the language, they are the idiomatic styles that are built up by the users of the language. Haskell&#x27;s community encourages writing short code which is clear once you understand whatever abstractions are being used (Applicatives, Monads, lists, curried functions, type classes and so on). This is in some ways the essence of programming, building abstraction upon abstraction to make beautiful, &quot;obviously correct&quot; code. Haskell allows very (cognitively and syntactically) cheap abstraction, so they&#x27;re used everywhere.<p>You complained about having to &quot;decrypt code&quot; in order to understand it, but this is true of any language; you may understand the keywords and how to put things together, but you won&#x27;t get far if you can&#x27;t get used to the idioms and conventions used by others using the language.",1398841877

7671966,comment,7665254,7668298,1,0,nkurz,,,"Allow me to tilt at a windmill:  even if you are optimizing code at this level, there is no reason to avoid branches.<p>On a modern processor, a correctly predicted branch-not-taken will almost always be free.  Not just inexpensive, actually free, since a superscalar processor can execute it on an otherwise unused port.  A correctly predicted branch-taken will not take more than a single extra cycle.  And branch prediction is good enough that you can presume that if a pattern exists, it will be correctly predicted.<p>The thing that can be expensive is a mispredicted branch in a tight loop.  That will cost you about 15 cycles (about twice as much as accessing L1, and 1/10th the price of hitting RAM).  In a case like this, unless you are expecting an unpredictable mix of overflow and non-overflow, branches are not a problem.  If the overflow is going to happen less than 10% of the time, using &quot;jo&quot; (jump overflow) after a numeric operation will be the fastest option.",1398841417
7671965,comment,7669836,7671848,3,0,davedx,,,"This is exactly the problem we&#x27;ve been running into building a medium sized interactive app in React. The management of data flow and state changes through the component hierarchy with callbacks can get quite complex, and you end up writing lots of callback boilerplate. So we&#x27;ve ended up rolling an event system that sits alongside the React components, and a lot of our app&#x27;s interactivity is managed through the event system.<p>We&#x27;re still learning, and are still not sure if we&#x27;ll be using React for our production version of what&#x27;s now a prototype. But I&#x27;m starting to feel more and more that we should use the strong points of React (the virtual DOM; so, send big CSS or DOM changes to the virtual DOM via state changes), and discard the other stuff (synthetic events, wiring components together via callbacks). It&#x27;s tricky figuring out the best way to use it.<p>I&#x27;m starting to think that I would rather just have React as an &quot;immediate mode rendering engine&quot; -- a thin view library. In its entirety it feels too constraining.",1398841351

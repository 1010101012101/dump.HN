A player is determined to be the ""server"" based on network conditions, and the plus side of it is also that should the server drop, the game will only be momentarily interrupted and you can select a new player to act as the server.<p>This doesn't work in all instances - most games using this mechanism are fairly small in terms of player count, since the server is not of a guaranteed performance level, the connection its on is probably a home-based broadband connection at best, and it has to invest a lot of cycles into rendering the game. For larger games (say, the Battlefield series) the hardware required makes it such that the system is infeasible. Instead you have extremely beefy hardware running dedicated servers - headless, non-rendering servers that can throw every cycle it has into serving the game.",1294558977

I have to have faith in these books and these people.  That's the essence of my argument -- very, very few of us have actual evidence.  What we have is the words of others.  In other words, there are only a small handful of people that have built a device that can measure background microwave radiation and devices to measure red-shift, etc.  Those few people know what they have observed and can interpret that information.  Everything else that is built on those observations (many more theories, etc) is based on a belief in those original few peoples' work.  And we, the masses, then have to believe those secondary interpretations.  Heck, I haven't even gotten the information from the data interpreters, but rather from other writers who have interpretted it further and written text books, blog posts, etc.  So yeah, it's pretty close to blind faith since I'm so many steps away from the truth, and don't have the ability (currently, with my existing education) to truely know it anyway even if I could speak directly to one of those scientists that built the space probe.

I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm genuinely curious.<p>Older games built on the Quake{1,2,3} engines use hardly any network bandwidth. Most Bad Company 2 games have only 32 players, which is hardly bigger than Quake1. What's going on that's so much more bandwidth intensive?",1294556841

Healthcare plan costs skyrocketed this year, to the tune of 30%-50% (not necessarily due to the healthcare bill, but a damaging hit nonetheless). As a result, the company was forced to eliminate the two most expensive plans that it did offer and consolidate down to the lowest cost one. In turn, many people were forced onto a plan they had never been on before.<p>He surveyed a couple different health insurance providers, but not a complete sampling by any means. Those providers he surveyed could very well have been the ones offering the cheaper plans. So I have to ask the question, could we be seeing a consolidation in the market rather than just an explosion of coverage?",1294556791

Apple is the party that has released a platform that you cannot install software on without going through them for permission (unless you jailbreak it using a remote-root vulnerability which is patched in more recent releases). Apple is the party that decides what can be in its app store under what rules; and it has decided to use a set of rules that are incompatible with the GPL. Apple has thus chosen to limit the software that is installable on their platform.<p>Apple could choose to allow VLC; they have the choice of making their terms compatible with the GPL (it's not that hard; just don't impose any additional restrictions on top of the ones that the GPL already imposes, and let the authors handle the rest of the GPL's requirements), or enabling people to side-load apps outside of the App store. Google does both on Android; the market terms are compatible with the GPL, and they allow side-loading (and even rooting on some phones).<p>However Apple chooses not to do this. Thus, Apple is limiting the set of software that can be used on their phone. If you use an iPhone (or iPad, or iPod Touch), you should be aware of this; you may not ever be able to get some software on it without cracking your phone's security, and Apple may be arbitrary and capricious in what they choose to allow and disallow. Apple may also remotely disable and uninstall software or content that is on your phone. If you want to choose what to install on your own phone, you should either buy a phone that gives you more freedom, or jailbreak your phone and then install whatever you want.",1294556726

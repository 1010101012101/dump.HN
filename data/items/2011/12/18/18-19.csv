3367200,comment,3366776,3366776,4,0,rayiner,,,"Another thing to consider for code like this is that all Intel CPU's since the Core 2 tend to suffer somewhat from loop-unrolling optimizations. They have limited fetch bandwidth and SSE instructions are pretty long. Instead, they've got a loop buffer after the instruction fetch unit (after the decoders in Nehalem), which can feed the decoders much faster than the fetch unit. However the buffer is limited in size, and if unrolling causes the loop to exceed the size of the buffer, it can result in a substantial performance penalty.",1324234647

Like VCs, they don't care at all about moderate success, anything less than phenomenal success is failure to them. So they'll burn your band/company out trying for unreasonable goals instead of helping you achieve whatever you can.<p>Your band could have been poised to be a very successful mid-level act and have been mispositioned, because mid-level acts aren't hugely profitable, and thus seemed to be a failure in a market you weren't wanting to compete in.<p>The small bands don't need a ton of financial support, especially these days. Recording a song can be done, professionally, for just a few thousand dollars and traveling to nearby concerts is pretty cheap. If you drop the idea of trying to sell an album in stores (payola!), and doing continent-wide tours, it's not all that expensive to spread your music to fans and enjoy a moderate return on investment.",1324234566

Your examples are interesting, but I still think that to say that <i>bottom</i> is an element of every Haskell type is to commit a level confusion.  It would be more accurate to simply say that expressions and variables in Haskell don't always have values.  What your examples show is simply that the language is not strict: an expression can have a value even if one of its subexpressions does not.<p>In mathematics, we don't have this notion of a variable with no value, so to write a formal semantics for Haskell we have to make up this ""meta-value"" <i>bottom</i>.  But it should not be confused with a value in the language, as it is not one.<p>Again, this is all my intuition and I'm not an expert.

AFAIK, YouTube was NOT required to provide this -- they just did it because they were probably getting hundreds of DMCAs per day and it was eating up time trying to validate them all.<p>I deal with DMCA takedown requests and we do things a lot differently. It's pretty commonly accepted that ISPs and networks have a 24-48 hour grace period before they MUST disable the content. The actual ""grace period"" isn't defined, but this page provides more info and suggests 6-12 hours, which I feel is unreasonably short for a user to take the content down by their own action:\n<a href=""http://www.shearsocialmedia.com/2010/08/dmcas-safe-harbor-may-only-provide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shearsocialmedia.com/2010/08/dmcas-safe-harbor-ma...</a><p>Here's the thing, we do web hosting. When DMCA idiot lawyers call us, they want /the entire server or IP taken offline/, sometimes just for one image (like a 400x300px JPG of the cover of a magazine). That, again IMO, is crazy. We never do that to our clients, but that's what the copyright thugs demand. We also force them to send all requests to abuse@ our domain and we refuse to discuss issues via phone. We've never been in legal trouble because of any of this, but we've had some of these thugs threaten to sue us (and they've also lied to us about what we're required to do).<p>Back to the meaning of ""expeditious"", Wikipedia has some great info: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#Meaning_of_.22expeditious.22"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_...</a> and suggests that 24 hours might be acceptable. Did I mention that most of the agencies sending us DMCAs do so at 10PM EST on a saturday, or other times obviously meant to force us to pull the content rather than give the client time to take it down willingly (we get a lot in the morning hours of Sunday as well). Lots of these firms are in India and just use something like TinEye to match images, then have aggressive people call during their day, but I still hold that this type of behaviour is pretty obviously done on purpose.<p>Anyway, regarding my original point, I think that it's not reasonable to expect someone like YouTube to provide a tool that is easy to use to take down videos. I think this was developed out of some big idea to try to gain favour with the MAFIAA, and I'd be very surprised if YouTube was in fact required by any law to develop a tool that makes it convenient for rights holders to pull content.",1324233624

It then claims that we ""don't get a very good ""off"" if the threshold voltage is too low"". This is incorrect. Leakage doesn't degrade the logic values for CMOS-style logic, which is the vast majority of the digital logic in the world.<p>The real issue which the OP may or may have been trying to get at is that leakage power eats into the chip's power budget. Since we'd rather not burn our budget on leakage, we reduce leakage by increasing the threshold voltage. But unfortunately, this comes at the cost of frequency.<p>The other very important issue is that of power-density. There's a famous graph that Shekar Borkar of Intel [1] made showing that if we continued to ignore power dissipation issues like in the past our chips would run ridiculously hot (IOW, they wouldn't work at all because they'd just burn themselves to death).<p>There are also other issues like the fact that your wires start acting like antennas at 5+ GHz and that reliability concerns like electromigration and dielectric breakdown are getting worse with newer technologies.<p>A much more recent and reliable  (not to mention highly-cited) reference on scaling and power issues is [2].<p>[1] I found a copy here: <a href=""http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/id1762_1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/id1762_1.jpg</a> \n[2] <a href=""http://www-vlsi.stanford.edu/papers/mh_iedm_05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-vlsi.stanford.edu/papers/mh_iedm_05.pdf</a>",1324232591

Im sorry to hear you were having problems with Twisted, but EventMachine is absolutely rock solid. I have gotten a lot of work done with it.<p>Now, lets say you dont want to do callbacks, but still take advantage of the Reactor pattern in EM. I wrote a patch for Sinatra that uses Fibers to wrap callbacks, hence allowing you to continue to program synchronously as you used to, and its called Sinatra Synchrony (<a href=""http://kyledrake.net/sinatra-synchrony"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kyledrake.net/sinatra-synchrony</a>).<p>But in order to do non-blocking IO, you dont need to use a Reactor pattern, because Ruby internally does not block on IO (the GIL does not affect this). And of course you get solutions like JRuby (built on the JVM), which provide for threads (and Rubinius 2 coming soon).<p>My APIs written with any and all of these concurrency options can get thousands of hits per second. Its quite scalable, but still provides all the rich libraries, reusable code, and testing support that makes my APIs high quality, which to me (and my users) is more important than making them fast. With this approach, my APIs are both high quality and fast. And I have never experienced a single crash of any worker processes in production. I would know, because my process monitor is smart enough to observe the workers in my deploy code and informs me, while adding another worker to replace the fallen one. Did I mention I can do zero-downtime hot deploys? Again, all implemented in Ruby.<p>Im not trying to brag here, but theres this weird current of arguments that these existing solutions dont scale. Its a myth, I dont know where it comes from, and Im worried that if I dont speak out against these arguments, Im going to wake up in a giant pile of half-baked Javascript spaghetti written by people that didnt even understand the real problem in the first place (blocking IO people, research it!).",1324232271

3367078,comment,3365742,3366373,5,0,mechanical_fish,,,"PHP is <i>indeed</i> a ""templating system turned on its head"" (according to second-hand reports from a talk by Rasmus Lerdorf, PHP was originally designed as a bare-bones templating system for C programmers, but then more and more stuff migrated into the templating system...). And it is, indeed (or was, anyway) tied strongly to a single domain, and a limited set of architectural patterns.<p>But every design choice cuts both ways. These features are not merely drawbacks. These are PHP's <i>strengths</i>, the things that make it so delicious for ""HTML authors who need to cross over into programming"".<p>You can learn PHP with Google. My understanding is that most people do. [1] Just Google all your problems and up will pop some code that you can mimic. This works because, to first order, <i>all PHP code is solving the same problem in the same way</i>. You will probably not accidentally Google up some PHP-based physics simulation. You will probably not Google up some PHP code used by sysadmins to parse the output of pipes on the command line. You will certainly not Google up any PHP-based graphics algorithms or device drivers or client-side DOM manipulations or Android system functions. No, when you Google ""how to do X in PHP"" you'll get some code that you can paste into a template with a .php extension and then execute on your cheap shared host. Until fairly recently there wasn't even any danger of encountering object-oriented PHP.<p>You can argue that programmers trained in this way are useless for anything but cobbling together Web pages, and you're right, but 90% of them don't care. Web pages are a killer app. People build whole businesses out of cheesy web pages.<p>My suspicion is that many PHP tinkerers don't want more ""architectural flexibility""; that translates into ""decisions that we have to make but don't know how to make"", ""knobs that we have to set carefully but which we don't even know how to turn"", and ""oodles of online documentation for use cases that we don't have, which chaffs up the search results for the use cases that we do have.""<p>The irony, of course, is that PHP's maintainers have been hard at work bolting features from other languages onto PHP, which as a side effect threatens to destroy the narrow domain-specificity that was its most unique feature. [2] Objects, namespaces, closures have all been welded onto the superstructure. One wonders what happens next. Maybe the folks who embrace all these things will drag the entire PHP community closer to Java, Python, Ruby, or some oddball superposition of these things. But I think it more likely that the community will continue to balkanize, with the bulk of users rejecting all these transplants but certain segments embracing one or another of them.<p>---<p>[1] I learned PHP via reading and hacking on Drupal modules, which is a much better plan, but also definitely not the beginner-friendly choice. Drupal has a steep learning curve.<p>[2] Though don't blame the maintainers too much: These features are in fact in demand, from the people who took up PHP without realizing that it was a narrow domain-specific language and pushed it right up to the limits of the available hacks.",1324231366

3367073,comment,3366822,3366822,9,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Peter Thiel believes smart people dont need college, and hes right<p>To be honest, most of the classes I've taken in my life (not just in college but in grade school as well) taught me very little that I couldn't learn by myself from a textbook. And in many cases, I did indeed end up teaching myself the material from the book (usually beforehand). This means that class time would essentially be a review session, or a time to highlight the topics that the professor wanted to focus on (useful for the exams). So the classes were definitely beneficial, but arguably unnecessary. This is partly a function of my own study habits and workflow, but I imagine that many other motivated students are in this category. And in the age of the Internet, the ability to teach yourself will become even more valuable.<p>That said, I wouldn't say my time in school was wasted, even if I could teach myself most (though not quite all!) of the things I learned in my classes. At least in college, my favorite classes were the ones which challenged my previous beliefs or forced me to consider things in another light (yes, this can happen in CS, too!). When you're learning things on your own, following your own interests, there's a natural tendency to avoid this kind of dissonance, which provides a sort of selection bias in what you end up learning.<p>Furthermore, college is a great time to meet other people and engage with them on an academic level. This can be your professors, who are oftentimes domain experts, or other students who share your interests. (Or even other students who don't). Yes, you meet smart people in the workforce and other aspects of life too, but it's rare to engage with them on the same type of academic level as you do when you're in an academic setting. (And even if you could simulate this through online classes... call me old-fashioned, but I still put a premium on in-person, face-to-face interaction).<p>My formal education has been incredibly valuable - just not for the reasons one typically considers a formal education to be valuable. If that's all you're considering, then yes, online classes can simulate most of that. But for me, they would have missed the most rewarding parts of my academic experience.",1324231227

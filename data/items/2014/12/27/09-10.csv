8802202,comment,8800788,8801788,0,0,gavanwoolery,,,"Yes, as user &quot;scroy&quot; points out I am talking about Voxel Quest.<p>Bits and pieces of my story are scattered around, but here is the full thing (grab a pillow):<p>In around 2000-2004, I was working several jobs while attending UCSB, as a gardener, a lab monitor, and a freelance web designer. I got by working the first couple years but the last year was hard and I was disqualified from engineering. I wanted to quit school but my parents pushed me to transfer. In 2004-2006, I worked on my first big game engine while finishing my degree.  I lived the majority of my time in isolation (at a school that was built over a &quot;haunted&quot; mental hospital of all places; I wish I was making this up: <a href=""http://www.hauntedplaces.org/item/camarillo-state-mental-hospital-csu-channel-islands/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hauntedplaces.org/item/camarillo-state-mental-hos...</a>).  The initial tech demo was well received, but no crowd-funding or &quot;early access&quot; existed at that point, and I tried to keep the game going via donations but only got about $200 outside of family (the original people who donated were given really good rewards from my recent Kickstarter campaign though).<p>My parents nudged me to get a paying job (I had been out of college for 6 months at that point), so I worked for a startup in SD called Goowy Media (funded by Mark Cuban, led by Alex Bard, and acquired by AOL - I was just an employee though).  Startup hours killed any hope of finishing the project but I kept working on small games and other projects in my spare time. In a way my many failures turned out to be the perfect storm.  For a lot of people, I think success kills their ambitions - they tend to get into funding other peoples projects rather than their own.  My failures hardened my desire for success, while helping me hone my skills.<p>Several years ago, I was working for my twin brother and his partner making mobile applications (we have both since left the company although I think he still might consult).  The people were all nice but the job was time consuming and not very interesting for me.  In spite of working long hours, I still tried to do what I could outside of work.  My job was often hard, but occasionally calm, so I had some windows to work on projects.  After a few brutal months of work, I got really desperate.  My life was falling apart in almost every respect - my health was suffering (there were some weeks I worked 100 hours), my relationship with my girlfriend (now wife) was naturally suffering as well, I was depressed, I had just finished paying off a large amount of debt so my financial situation was only just recovering.  I started testing the waters for other jobs (could not find any good fits), and started cold-emailing investors to pitch bad ideas (no responses of course).<p>I remember the exact moment I turned my life around. It is kind of embarrassing to say, but I was looking at myself in the bathroom mirror, and I looked like hell, and I broke down into tears (I don&#x27;t often cry, or express any emotion for that matter - it takes a lot to get anything out of me).  I wanted to blame my situation on anyone but myself, I wanted to feel sorry for myself, and then I realized that was exactly what was wrong with my life.  Who was going to change my life if not me?  F__k it, I thought, I&#x27;m reprogramming my life <i>now</i>.<p>I put in my one month notice to quit, and threw a &quot;Hail Mary&quot; pass to Reddit, asking for advice about what to do in my situation.  To my surprise, a person from Switzerland looked over my work and offered to invest some money (he was not an investor, just had some money in savings that he was willing to loan out). I was going to Germany to meet my (at the time) girlfriend&#x27;s family, and made a side trip to Switzerland to meet my investor in what felt like a clandestine James Bond meeting. I also snuck in a proposal to my wife while in Switzerland. :)<p>With my job severance and new investment, I began to bootstrap my game (Voxel Quest).  I worked over a year on it (doubletime), and posted here on HN a few times.  In fact, HN was almost solely responsible for my success up to this point, as it was one of the few communities that seemed to get what I was working on. Each time I posted to HN, I would hit the top of the front page, and investors began to take interest.  Right now I pay myself about $15/hour and have a wife/kid/dogs/car/house to pay for, so choosing to stay private was not easy.  I invested my life in my work, and cashing out felt too much like giving up on realizing its full potential (or I am just really bad at making financial decisions, you choose). :) In spite of turning everyone down, several have offered more than once, so there is comfort in knowing that additional options exist if needed.<p>I launched my Kickstarter at perhaps the worst time possible, when projects are failing left and right, press is refusing to cover many KS projects, and backers are more skeptical than ever. I was lucky to reach and exceed my goal, and I am extremely thankful to everyone here for making it happen (over 1/3 of donations came from here on HN).<p>Right now I am just working hard, when not procrastinating as with writing this.  I try to update weekly, and each update seems to bring a bit of new interest and preorders are picking up so I am still optimistic about the way things are going, even though life is not easy at this point.<p>A few more tips:\nNever hide your work. Make everything you do public.  I went 6 months between updates, which is an eternity in project time.  Strive to update weekly, no matter how small the amount of work done. It can seem time consuming but you will get better at it the more you do it.<p>Publicity will make you accountable for your work (or lack thereof), it will motivate you (via praise), and it will help you improve your results (via criticism).<p>Share your successes, even if you are not comfortable tooting your own horn.  People like to hear about success, and it breeds interest in your work.",1419673924

The only relapse you can have is either due to poor treatment(which again goes back to having limited to no healthcare infrastructure) to reinfection which again is a sanitary issue.\nTurning marshes into fields, stable water and sewage infrastructure, sanitary life stock control all help fight Malaria, and are probably more important in the eradication of it than just dumping more and more meds which are not properly distributed in the first place.",1419673900

Rarely anyone seems to care about the social or humanitarian angle of it, not to mention the historical significance to the US as a country. Is it really that controversial to allow other people that didn&#x27;t win the birth-lottery a chance to work here if they proven themselves to be qualified enough? Isn&#x27;t that what the US was founded on and what at least the H1B was exactly meant for? And can anyone really honestly argue that the 65k H1Bs that are awarded each year could put considerable pressure on the average wage in a country of 300M (especially considering the strict wage requirements which people seem to happily ignore in most arguments here). Why are people so upset about a few immigrants - fearing for their wages - when clearly the wage-fixing amongst Google, Apple & Co. had a much more severe influence?

To him, that&#x27;s an afterthought.<p>This is a strawman argument as Stallman does not advocate this at all. Stallman encourages for programmers to get paid for programming work and to sell software at any price that the customer will burden. Stallman is happy for everybody to do business and profit when the business does not hurt people. In the business model of selling proprietary software and selling SAAS, users are harmed of four specific freedoms of free software so Stallman will condemn any business (or any other non-business organization) that does this.",1419671783

Respective governments have a role to play in improving the health systems research and I am not sure that is the mandate of the Gates foundation or any other charity. Furthermore, it may mean meddling with political forces in their respective areas of support and I am not sure if that would really ease the situation.<p>After all what has the Brenton Woods institutions gained or improved in resource poor countries? Have they not poured billion of dollars in loans and grants and even given conditions (some very painful) on how to administer the monies? What has improved?

3090552,comment,3088918,3089442,2,0,vga15,,,"Apologies for the late reply. Lot of interesting stuff packed into your comment. Thanks for taking the time. Also, great to know you're healthier now.<p>I'm intrigued about your 'openly hostile' target market. Firstly, it sounds like you've thought about your target audience quite a bit. Great sign. \nWhy would they be hostile about you solving their pains? Is it the price point? Privacy concerns? General mistrust?<p>Or is it likely you're packaging an anti-depressant as a pain-killer.\n(<a href=""http://pablobrenner.wordpress.com/2011/09/18/neither-painkillers-nor-vitamins-antidepressants/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pablobrenner.wordpress.com/2011/09/18/neither-painkil...</a>)<p>You say 'the audience isn't ready for that'. That seems perfectly fine. You can probably think ahead a lot more than they can. But it'd be great to have some validation, even if that means dealing with their hostility, to get through.<p>-----<p>I'll echo the advice about starting with a design doc. Once you know what the game should be like, you can start implementing tiny features and learn along the way. \nWhen I'd starting building games (new to programming as well), I had weekly goals that were like ""fighter jet moves right/left using arrow keys, over a static background"". Next week would have 'implement top-down scrolling background' etc. When you're starting out, its important to take care of your mental state. Things that seem trivial might take much longer. You've gotta keep reminding yourself that its a learning experience too. That with every seemingly trivial item that you conquer, your value in the market increases.<p>With games, it often is easy to get overwhelmed. You'll need to split yourself into 'designer/manager' and 'developer'. The developer works on the tiniest, most detailed instructions. The designer/manager is allowed only a single day a week perhaps, to write (in detail) about the next tiny feature to implement & to dream of new features.\nIn my case, I'd get my 'big plan' down on paper(about 2 pages worth about what the entire game was like), from memory, every single week. Just so I'd know subconsciously, where the project as a whole was headed.<p>-----<p>Here's hoping you'll be inspiring others with your story soon.",1318172208

As ehambers pointed out Lombok (or for the same feeling, islands of the Philippines) is nice if you like the beach - I think for me 3 months in a place like this and it would not look like paradise anymore. If I stay longer somewhere, It would be in a big city - I miss the energy if I'm staying in the mountains or the beach for too long.<p>If that's the same for you, then you could go to cities with great access to nature, like Yogjakarta, Indonesia, Cebu, Philippines, Hanoi, Vietnam...<p>On the inexpensive side: you cannot get much cheaper than Vietnam. Philippines and Indonesia while still cheap are more expensive.<p>I would also recommend not to stay in a hotel but to look for an apartment. I found a good apartment in 2 days in Hanoi (there's a good website for expats), it might be harder in smaller cities.<p>Of course, nothing limits you to Southeast Asia :-)",1318172208

I lived not far from Heathrow but I picked a departure from Gatwick and return to Heathrow. I rang up the airline (Emirates) and they said they could change it if it was booked through them and Expedia were no help.<p>Nowadays American Airlines has all my details so booking flights through their website is easy.<p>Hipmunk provides a great interface and I feel bad for not booking through it but I've been burnt on this a number of times so just won't do it anymore.<p>Plus there are other advantages like seat selection through the airline's website.<p>Perhaps the business model for online travel booking needs to evolve from the current commission model to an affiliate model like Amazon. If, say, Hipmunk directs you to aa.com they get a commission on purchases made by you on aa.com for the next 24 hours or whatever.",1318171636

3090478,comment,3090184,3090184,2,0,apaprocki,,,"""Hacking"" airports is especially useful due to certain airport layouts. #1 rule about standing in line: everyone just stands in line without understanding why they are standing in line.<p>For instance, in Philadelphia, the airport security is outside of the inner walkway which connects terminals D & E. E was the international terminal, so there was always way less traffic going in/out of the gate. Sometimes D would have a security line backed up to the curb. Simply walk over to terminal E and bypass the entire line.<p>Similarly, in LaGuardia, there are <i>two</i> taxi lines outside the American terminal. One is all the way at the end, hidden from sight. Everyone not familiar with the airport just lines up at the main one and if you walk around the edge of the terminal you can hop in a taxi right away.<p>Anyone seriously optimizing their travel, though, will most likely be a loyalty member of some airline alliance and the goal is to maximize your upgrades (free or otherwise) to always fly business/first.<p>For example, AA has a ""challenge"" where you can automatically earn Platinum status if you earn 10,000 points in 90 days. This isn't terribly difficult if you're flying to an international conference. You quite literally call a 1-800 number and say ""I want to take the challenge."" Platinum gives you automatic domestic business class upgrades when available!",1318169948

The food is amazing and nasi goreng (fried rice with some meat and vegetables) is often not more than $0.40$0.50.<p>Another thing: It's really easy to pick up some Indonesian phrases since the language is quite simple to pronounce and has a really simple grammar. The language does not have the concept of tones that other south-east Asian languages (Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese...) have, so even if the pronunciation is a bit off, people will understand you.

Is the method constructive, so that every group reduces to a corresponding graph in an understandable way?<p>I have a somewhat cranky reason for asking. In evolutionary algorithms, a <i>mutation</i> operator is one which transforms an existing genome into a single new one. One can study the behaviour of an operator by drawing an edge from old to new genomes, for every possible genome, and studying the resulting graph. A <i>crossover</i> operator takes two parent genomes to produce a new one. No-one really has a satisfactory method of studying crossover analogous to that for mutation. The problem is we need edges to lead from pairs of nodes to single nodes. So kind of like hyperedges but not exactly. I've been hoping for a while that there is an answer in existing graph theory.<p>Crossover is also kind of like a group operation, but again not exactly. So that's why the idea of mapping a group to a graph is interesting.",1318169401

I\n    interviewed for jobs with him 3 times: once before\n    he was fired, once at NeXT and once after he\n    returned. Each was a long lunch at The Good Earth.\n    Each was a wonderful, intriguing conversation, but\n    I left each thinking, No, I cant work for\n    this man: hes mad! That visionary madness\n    drove him and his company with a tremendous force.\n    He was personally not an engineer or a designer,\n    but he had a tremendous sense for excellence. Many\n    companies use focus groups to help them\n    refine products, but not Apple: they just had\n    Steve. He was often criticized for being a\n    control freak, but that was all in pursuit\n    of excellence: anything out of his control was out\n    of his ability to improve.  He didnt just have\n    a sense for Apples products, he had a sense for\n    Apples customers and what would delight them.\n    As much as he was devoted to Apple, he was more\n    devoted to Apples customers. One of the biggest\n    drivers of Apples success in recent years is\n    the delight their customers feel in every part of\n    the process, even something as simple as opening a\n    box is thought through carefully. Every detail\n    matters.\n\n</code></pre>\nThe thing that really stood out in the giant collection of comments that have been published about Jobs over the last 3 days by almost everyone of any importance in the tech world is how many of these people were positively influenced by him.<p>This includes some of Jobs and Apple's strongest competitors--for instance when Larry Page took over as Google CEO in April, he says that Jobs reached out to give him advice and knowledge to be CEO even though Jobs was very sick by then. Note that this is well after Apple and Google had become fierce rivals in mobile.<p>That's how things work in Silicon Valley. Companies can be bitter rivals, but the people that run them can be friends and help each other. Business and people are separate.<p>What I find sad about the comments of RMS and ESR is that they are so one dimensional. They view people like they are in comic books--they must either be heroes who are good all the time, or villains who constantly plot evil from their secret volcano lair while stoking a cat. Real life humans aren't like that.",1318169247

This is exemplified by the complexity of Berkshire Hathaway.  Berkshire Hathaway isnt just your average insurance company.  The brilliance behind Buffetts investment in Berkshire is astounding.  He effectively used (and uses) Berkshire as the worlds largest option writing house.

Buffett was placing some (short-term AND long-term) complex bets in derivatives markets, options markets, and bond markets.   The myth that Buffett is a pure value investor is just that.

I think many of the underperformers have what might be considered subclinical mental illness (but is more accurately described as the normal exaggerated sensitivity of creative people and adolescents).<p>So, they're more ""fragile"" off the bat, and this is probably neurological in basis. We can provide more support as a society, but there are obvious limits regarding what can be done here.<p>Second, society is generally bad at recognizing talent and connecting it with the resources that could be used to actualize it. Those resources tend to go to people-pleasers and horse-traders rather than to those who can make the most use of them (who are almost always viewed with suspicion). This is true as much in academia as anywhere else.<p>Combine the general stupidity of society and the hypersensitivity of the sharpest intellects, and you have a lot of very smart people who get discouraged and bitter, then lose all desire to play.",1267466023

I'm English and I've worked as a writer and I've done copy-editing, and that 'but' has every right to be there, even if it hurts the flow of the sentence. For anyone growing up in an English speaking country we all know that a pause readily means 'but', especially if it was a longer pause.<p>As it's a translation of something he said, the issue here is the integrity of the translator not of the man himself. A good translator would have dropped the but, because he likely never used it when he spoke in Korean.<p>I've spent a lot of time in France, and even though I'm nowhere near fluent I still manage to speak the slang. By spending time in the country and amongst the people I learnt all the social norms for speaking that I never learnt in a high school class. There's a vast difference in usage between <i>Bonsoir</i> and <i>Bonne nuit</i>, the latter is literally used exclusively in the meaning ""goodnight, I won't see you again today"". Similarly I've seen many a confused tourist when they were greeted with <i>Salut</i> ""bye"" as a greeting.<p>Again from several vacations in Spain and the Spanish islands, I rarely ever heard <i>Gracias</i> ""Thank you"", they all use <i>Graci</i> ""thanks"", again despite everything I was taught of Spanish it wasn't right to how people actually speak.<p>There's a big difference between being fluent in a language, and being fluent in a dialect. Dialects typically teach us how to use English improperly, mainly because 90% of our interactions are informal. However almost every English speaking person would remove their dialect in the instance if they were brought in front of a world leader. I know for people receiving Knighthoods from the queen they have to instruct people on how to pronounce ""ma'am"" (pronounced mam) as they try to pronounce it 'properly' and in doing so pronounce it wrong, which apparently bugs the Queen herself as she's been noted for correcting people on it too.",1267464920

It IS state funded, yes, but it is a separate entity with a board a charter and lots of non-governmental oversight.<p>> Yeah, speaking of that: ""BBC blocks open source video players""<p>True, a bit of a hiccup there. I cant believe their timing on such a fuck up too :( really screwed my argument<p>> We have the FCC; how is that different?<p>It's very different. Ofcomm is actually heavily consumer oriented and they seem to find a good balance between restricting content and being sensible. Certainly they are very unlike the FCC in my (reasonably limited) experience.<p>> Firstly, CSI is an American franchise. Advertisements over here are likely making up the difference for those smaller commercial breaks over there.<p>Im not sure it is. Channel 5 will pay a fixed rate to show the CSI franchise over here. They can make that money back in whatever way they want/need. Also I dont think it equates like that (I have no figures but I watched a documentary on CSI a few months ago that said most of the franchise's revenue comes from overseas licencing).<p>> But you can't say one way or the other what kind of television you might have if the BBC didn't exist, because it's been with you since 1932.<p>Perhaps true. But the BBC is reasonably unique. And in my opinion (and it really is my opinion, but I know others share it) we have the best TV programing in the world. A mix of all things<p>> There are solutions to our many television problems, and all of them involve LESS government, NOT more.<p>As I mentioned - there is a difference between tax funded and government owned. Italy has govt. owned TV (also their PM owns a shed load of the network) and I would never recommend anything like that!<p>But tax funded is pretty good because it's answerable to us, the viewers. Which is nice.<p>> that could otherwise be utilized by broadcasters who are actually accountable to their viewers (and their viewers' wallets)?<p>I guess ultimately it's not clear outside the UK what the BBC actually is. Hopefully I've explained it better.

But it comes in increments.  It comes in  mostly in pieces we have to put together.  Einstein didn't make the world a better place single-handedly, it was the engineers who came after and created GPS (for instance) that did it.  There's no reason this guy should have created miracles with his IQ, we probably don't have enough of the base research to solve that (whichever) problem, yet.<p>Instead, he's improved the world a bit (quite a bit in the sector of civil engineering apparently).

Probably 20-30% of those in the ruling class have a high enough IQ (125+) to be there but less than 1% have sufficient culture. Paul Wolfowitz and Dick Cheney come to mind as examples. They're so uncultured they probably eat steak with their fingers; that such louts could rise to such high levels of influence is a serious problem. And our society is such an ugly mess because people like them (uncultured people, with ugly minds) rise to power and remake the world in their image.<p>I think it's also obvious that most business executives are selected for people-pleasing and crude optimizations (next-quarter profits) rather than vision, creativity, and humanity.<p>The traditional two-tier managerial structure (although excruciatingly flawed and less-than-useless in practice) had the right idea. At one degree above the average (110-125) you have the managers, whom the line workers look to for leadership, but who do not alienate them with their intelligence. At two degrees up (125-145) you have the executives, who can lead and mentor the managers, and whose closer connection to ""the metal"" gives them a strong voice in the decision-making. At 3 and more degrees, you have strategists and academics who present the information and advise the decisions. However, modern corporate society doesn't work this way; the executives are often mediocrities, the ""advisor"" class isn't really listened-to, and most of what goes on in academia is self-referential bullshit.<p>""Rule by the smart"" is not flawless, of course. Bigger problems than a lack of intelligence in our ruling class are the lack of integrity, vision, and compassion... which are also much harder to measure-- although all of these correlate are correlated <i>much</i> more strongly with IQ than with ""leadership"" as measured by our current selection process. Therefore, an ""IQ meritocracy"" would be an improvement.

Eg, the reason MacPorts uses it's own python is beucase Apple is slow to update their own python, and when they do it happens outside of your own setup so you won't necessarily know you need to rebuild X, Y and Z.<p>* Homebrew did some silly things like aggressive stripping (which seemed to just be commands pulled from the Gentoo wiki without any real justification) which caused problems a few times when I tried to install things outside of Homebrew (eg, easy_install of MySQLdb didn't work out-of-the-box with the Homebrew mysql libs).",1267463181

Here, alpha is a parameter representing how much you care about code size. I.e., if alpha = 1 sec / 1mb, then you will accept code which is 0.99 seconds slower if it shaves 1mb off the code size, but not code which is 1.01 seconds slower.",1267463179

Maybe there are lots of individual Lisps that are each perfect for some class of problems.  That's one of the great strengths of Lisp: if an existing implementation is almost-but-not-quite what you need, you can throw a few macros on it and adapt it into a new language that <i>is</i> what you need.<p>It's one of the greatest weaknesses too: you don't see the same willingness to say ""This is good enough; let's move on to more interesting problems"" that you get with, say, Python/PIL or Ruby on Rails.<p>If you're going to create a new Lisp (and expect people to use it; creation for the sake of creation is another thing, and doesn't need justification), you've gotta answer why it's superior to throwing a few macros on top of an existing Scheme or CL implementation.  After all, wouldn't an individual programmer know his specific problem better than you do?  They don't <i>have</i> to worry about harmonizing a variety of concerns, because they don't have to worry about other people's concerns.  They could just build the language that's best for their specific problem and keep it in their own private toolbox.",1203137698

116860,comment,116768,116790,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I think people like to be correct in predicting the failure of crazy-sounding ideas because they don't want to feel like they are missing out on something big. I know I predicted that Google was all hype when it was selling at $200/share and unloaded the few shares I had. I kick myself for it now obviously, and even though it made no financial difference to me whether it sunk to $25 or went up to $600 (since I no longer owned shares), I still couldn't help hoping it would tank so I would feel like I made the correct decision.<p>I think this is really why you don't have to worry about competitors. If your idea is good enough, everyone will think you are crazy/naive. If your idea is simply decent, you'll never pick it anyway (because it's not exciting enough to you) and it will end up getting done by some existing company. Either way whatever you actually <i>choose</i> to work on will be unique until it's proven, by which point no competitor is catching you anyway.",1203137399

That's the definition of ""right now.""  It is a horrible, horrible measure of what can or should be achieved.<p>I don't think Paul intended this to be a ground-breaking article.  I doubht he's saying that those specific examples lead him to a certain process with a certain guaranteed successful result.  In other words, he's not saying because a=b, and b=c, a=c.  In that case, if you can disprove the examples, Paul's theories don't stand.<p>What I interpreted PG to say is that he has done things a certain way for a while, and has noticed correlation where people reject change time and time again, but that this is normal, and in fact, one of the steps in the process of innovation.<p>You need to 1) come up with a simple concept that benefits someone, especially yourself or someone you know who might care to look at it when it's ready (that you know you can do in a weekend even if it actually takes you a while) 2) promise to that person or anyone else besides you that you will release the software you promised 3) release the crappiest version you can that has the least features and is so unimpressive that it's stunning (esp. if you release before your deadline which gets you feedback sooner) 4) take criticism and make adjustments 5) come up with a system to make promises to do x by a certan date and a parallel system to make and measure forward progress towards any of the objectives 6) stick with it because people really love it when you've been so dedicated to a project 7) you're now an expert and have a lot of design and coding experience under your belt, as well as happy users who like that you're improving the app and listening to them.<p>Most people never get past step 1 or 2, even though at those steps you really don't have to do anything.<p>Oh, and step 8) you will learn what makes your body tick and become very efficient and feel like you're ""improving exponentially"" and 9) you will come up with ideas and insights that may make you sound insane, especially since you'll be so confident and focused you'll be blurting them out, but that 10) a year or two later will have been proven 100% true.",1203136570

I mean, there's zoning everywhere, but when you throw in the Bay and the mountains, there's just too little land to start with.  When there's unmet demand due to artificially reduced supply, prices can go up very rapidly.",1203136564

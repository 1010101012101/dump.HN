Drew made the tradeoff between convenience and security/ownership one that convenience won out, particularly for a lot of people that from the outset were not expecting it. I think Dropbox&#x27;s adoption in the smartphone world has been one of the most ingenious partnerships. I had pretty much the same experience in that I really only started looking at Dropbox as a serious solution to me when my Samsung phone shipped with a free account (+ I got a whole lotta free space through my university finishing high in the space race).<p>I&#x27;m not a daily linux user myself, so what particularly interests me is what Dropbox&#x27;s adoption rate is like in the linux world. This seems to me to be the toughest nut to crack, since most linux users are power users in the sense that they&#x27;re savvy enough to setup their own Unison/rsync etc. system.<p>My conclusion after thinking about Dropbox more is that it&#x27;s a testament to the fact that to the majority of people convenience wins out over most other things (so long as the execution is bang on).",1382950555

Also there are numerous tools to check code quality (e.g. Sonar).

Besides, dropbox was just yet another iteration of online file hosting (I&#x27;m pretty sure rapidshare and megaupload predated dropbox by years), so if file sharing was going to blow up, it would have already, right?<p>And therein lies the true genius of dropbox. The technology itself had already been done to death; the key was to convince a critical mass of people that this was the solution to their problems.

There will be always be a point if you follow that line of thought where the power in place will crush your individual interests just for the sake of making your condition the same as everyone else (even on the basis of good intentions...). That, in itself, is against Human nature, where humans strive to build advantage for ourselves to improve our conditions and our odds to survival and to lead a better life. And don&#x27;t tell me Humans don&#x27;t do that, everyone wants their kids to be in good school and to get a better job than themselves. It&#x27;s universal no matter from which culture you come from.<p>With Egalitarianism, you end up with policies where education is strictly controlled by one governmental body, and where Education goes to the lowest common denominator and becomes basically crap for everyone involved. You end up with public health services which are subpar, with waiting lines and mediocre equipment, because you want to treat everyone the same way while running on limited resources. And this has already happened in many countries in Europe where such policies were driven to the core of the governmental actions. In the end you create more inequalities because people who really have money have the possibility to leave the country and get better services elsewhere, while the middle-class and the poor are forever restrained to a diminished quality of life.<p>My point is that libertarian ideals are more respectful of individuals, because they allow for the flexibility of choosing your own course of action, maximizing your responsibility. In that sense they are closer to the natural order where one individual can create an advantage for themselves based on their action while living as part of a social group.

You can write them all down, you can verify that there are no more (this part is hard), but I do not know of any deep insight as to why.<p>I should note that the 26 and the 18 for finite simple groups were not just computed numbers, either.  A few attempts at a complete classification were made and failed because they were missing a few cases.  If I recall, it was unclear for a time if the Monster group really was the largest sporadic group.<p>I also recall a story I was once told by Andrew Sutherland.  He was working on what is called a local-global principle, which would show that if a property is true of elliptic curves at every prime, it is true over the rationals (with some constraints). He found, after several failed proof attempts, that something special happened at the prime 7. Why 7? Well, it is not too large and not too small...<p>A last connection: consider the deterministic linear-time median-finding algorithm.  It begins: &quot;break up the elements into groups of 5.&quot; In this case, the reason 5 is the size of the groups is simply that the answer must be odd; that 3 doesn&#x27;t work; and that smaller is better.<p>Small numbers are weird.",1382949564

6625754,comment,6624701,6625419,1,0,lsc,,,">So it&#x27;s only partially true that the poor benefit from inflation. They&#x27;ll benefit from cheaper debt payments and possibly higher employment. But they&#x27;re unlikely to see much of the added money supply in wages, and they&#x27;re going to take it in the chin on prices.<p>The theory is that inflation will decrease wages for anyone making above market wages.   That&#x27;s one of the mechanisms by which economists theorize that inflation stimulates the economy.  Downward nominal wage rigidity, and all that.<p>If you are arguing that minimum wage workers are making above market wages (and that argument is supported by the evidence of the high unemployment rate)   well, That&#x27;s certainly a valid point.   But those making $10/hr at mcdonalds? (the California minimum is $8.00 and McDonalds will pay you a little more than that after you&#x27;ve been there for a while.)  - are those folks making market-clearing wages?  I&#x27;d argue that they are.<p>However, the other side of this is that inflation is generally thought to increase the demand for labor in general.   I mean, my personal take on it is that we have vastly more unskilled labor than we have demand for.   We need more demand.  More demand for labor would mean that companies wouldn&#x27;t be so picky.   That&#x27;s the thing, companies whine about not having skilled labor, but when the economy gets hot?   Companies train.    I think I&#x27;ve written before how I got a programming/sysadmin gig when I was 17... in 1997, and how that would have been nearly impossible four years later.  Meanwhile, I turned those four years into enough experience to remain employed through the crash.    I became a dramatically more valuable employee during those four years, and I don&#x27;t think that this increase in value is because I&#x27;m some extra special super-virtuous worker.  I think most people in that situation would have become dramatically more valuable.<p>So yeah; I think we need to create demand.  The private sector could do this by coming up with new industries (like the service sector in the &#x27;80s.)  or the government could do this directly through WPA style projects.   Inflation, I think, can be seen as part of an attempt by the government to stimulate the private sector into doing it.   But either way, I think demand is key.    Demand is the problem.<p>Long-term unemployment has brutal long-term consequences that are much worse than simply not earning as much for a while, because not only are you not earning while unemployed, you aren&#x27;t gaining experience.  You aren&#x27;t becoming more valuable for your future jobs.     It&#x27;s bad on an individual level, but it&#x27;s also bad on a macro level;   there is a real reason why experienced folks get paid more.  They are more productive.",1382948073

6625752,comment,6610593,6613569,3,0,bad_user,,,"Thanks @curveship for replying.<p>C# is more capable and saner than Java and to tell you the truth, C# has been the first static language that I used with joy. If it weren&#x27;t for Scala, I would have prefered C#. Skipping over platform limitations and considering just the language, I still prefer Scala any day of the week.<p>Let me outline the differences between the examples I&#x27;ve posted and the ones that you did.<p><pre><code>    list.sum
</code></pre>
In Scala this example outlines the usage of the Numeric[T] type-class. A type-class [1] is like an implemented interface in Java and C#, except that you don&#x27;t need the ability to modify the type in order to implement this interface. See the Expression Problem [2].<p>In C# or Java, the concept of adding numbers is not being exposed as a standard interface. In C# the + operator is a static member, so it cannot be part of an interface (in Scala there is no such thing as static members btw). In Java the + operator is something special reserved for primitives. In Scala it doesn&#x27;t matter how + is exposed, because you can implement a Numeric[T] for whatever type you want and hence you can treat any type you want as a number in generic data-structures and algorithms. If you implement your own Complex type or RomanNumeral type, no problem, as you can sum them up as long as you also implement Numeric[Complex] and Numeric[RomanNumeral].<p>In contrast, for your sample to work, the C# engineers had to add extension method overloads of IEnumerable.Sum() for each number in the system. But what do you do if you want to add your own number implementation, like a BigDecimal or something with better performance for your use case. Yes, in Scala it works, without hacks.<p><pre><code>    list.sorted
</code></pre>
In Scala, this uses the Ordering[T] type-class. Again, it&#x27;s an open interface to which you can add any type, even types whose implementations you don&#x27;t control. Also, the C# version is NOT statically type-safe, while the Scala version is. This compiles just fine, but fails at runtime ...<p><pre><code>    var list = new List<object>() { 1, &quot;2&quot;, 3 };
    list.Sort()
</code></pre>
Want to guess why that is? Because in C# you also can&#x27;t add extra method usage restrictions on the generic types of a class. So you can&#x27;t have a &quot;sorted&quot; method on a class that only works in case your initialized T is part of the Ordering type class. I.e. you either have to restrict T to some interface site-wide (so you can&#x27;t use your class for anything but things that can be sorted), or you have to rely on runtime reflection / runtime errors.<p>There is value in doing this, rather than doing it with an OrderBy that takes a function for the comparison operation. First of all, many types have <i>natural ordering</i> and the inability to implement this means that you can&#x27;t express <i>natural ordering</i> in your language. Also, these are really simple examples. You don&#x27;t see the value of this until you start working with these tools in the real world in more and more complex problems.<p>Your examples with the HashSet and the Dictionary are wrong. They aren&#x27;t doing the same thing.<p>In Scala, a BitSet is a Set of integers that stores those integers efficiently in-memory. It&#x27;s a different implementation from a regular HashSet, specialized on storing integers. When mapping over a BitSet, you want the result to still be a BitSet, otherwise you lose its properties. But the result can&#x27;t be a BitSet if you&#x27;re not returning integers in that mapping function. You missed the point of my example.<p>So basically Scala allows you to override the returned type, based on the given mapping function and it does so in a statically type-safe way, as the real return type is noticed by the compiler (i.e. it&#x27;s compile-time ad-hoc polymorphism, not runtime). And best of all, the mechanism is pluggable so you can always override the given defaults.<p>Of course, you can have dozens of utility methods that allow you to escape the limitations of your language. You can build anything on top of Java and C# actually.<p>It&#x27;s still death by a thousand cuts and in case you can&#x27;t see it, ask yourself why you haven&#x27;t done functional programming in C#, even though it is possible to do so. And yes I know, some people do it, just like some people are doing OOP in C.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem</a>",1382948013

Simply think about it: if you are interested in high tech, where do you go in the USA? Certainly not to the telco. Now ask the same question in France, where do you go? Maybe in telco. The reason is that some countries like France, South Korea, Germany, etc. did not have a big tech sector. Also very little start up culture. But they understood the importance of the tech sector and they did what they could to unblock it by breaking the local mafia. So, the end result is low cost internet.

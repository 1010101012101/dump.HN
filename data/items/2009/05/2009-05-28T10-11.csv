He collected everything that was out there that he could get his hands on. I think this makes a huge difference.”<p>This is probably worse. This means the next guy without the same collection will be sentenced based on what he is, not on what he does.",1243508274

There's no technology angle, there's no hacker angle. I can't even extrapolate the general principles into something resembling a startup angle.

630012,comment,628510,629232,0,0,gdee,,,"> I take it you also object to laws that prevent you using the gun you've purchased to shoot someone<p>Well it depends on the context but your example is wrong in any context. I would object to a law prohibiting me to use a gun I bought (as if I could, seeing how I live in Spain) as a hammer for example. Or to paint it pink (as if I would). All stretched counterexamples, I agree, but there is an underlying trend.<p>> using the lighter you've bought to start a fire<p>Wrong kind of analogy again. I object to being forbidden from engraving my zippo. Or braking it to pieces.<p>> driving the car you've bought over a pet dog<p>Wrong kind of analogy again. I (would) object to being forbidden from repainting the car. Or cutting it in half. Or reselling it to someone else.<p>I could go on with the reactor (oh please), the printing press (you're trying to hard), the stereo and so on but it's useless because they are all dishonest analogies. They put the focus on forbidden actions for witch the owned items are mere tools. Objections to DRM are generally focused on forbidden actions to witch the owned items are subjects. Like transposing a DVD to watch it on my PMP. Huge difference. And I think you knew that difference already.",1243507457

The Facebook AIR client polls your newsfeed for updates and displays them in a rich text widget - 150M resident on this Windows PC after a few hours use. To put that into perspective I have a Tcl/Tk app that does more things (not FB, internal data feeds) running in 7M resident, no leaks.<p>I don't see AIR as being usable for any ""real"" applications which are often left running for days at a time, and are far more complex.

They then suggested &quot;MIT but without the attribution&quot; which didn&#x27;t go down well with some people, so now they&#x27;re suggesting &quot;MIT but you don&#x27;t need to paste the license into the code&quot;, meaning that the code is MIT licensed but it&#x27;s enough if you put the URL of the stackoverflow answer in a comment.<p>The new license (basically MIT) is <i>a lot</i> more permissive than the old one (CC-BY-SA), which was compatible with virtually no open source license and just doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense for code.",1452866385

Works quickly and reliably at distances up to perhaps 10 feet; can also stop some animal attacks. Usually not heavily regulated, making it easy to obtain and carry even in places that frown upon other forms of armed self-defense.<p>This is not good advice everywhere. Here in the UK pepper spray is regulated by the same law as firearms.",1452866383

This was caused by general initiative of that government to get cheap loans to people, and it was effective. I am not aware of any more direct pressure to the lenders, which doesn&#x27;t mean there wasn&#x27;t some.<p>Derivates being another topic - just to topic of people getting loans beyond their means, overall it&#x27;s the same crysis topic, and I think we agree that there is no good justification from banks for this part.<p>Why banks were saved - apart from dirty business of bribery and lobbying which is sad daily part of political existence, there is part about something along:  john doe has some money in the bank, this bank goes bust, and he loses it all. There is a chance of getting some % of it in future in settlements, but nothing guaranteed. In that situation, no politician would willingly go there if they can avoid it. It&#x27;s too easy to start pointing on them, and everybody takes it badly if they lose money because of somebody else&#x27;s mistake.<p>What happened in the banks - bonuses, based only on last year&#x27;s performance. Source of a good deal of evil roaming banking (and trading too). It means many pushing for short-term gains, not caring about broader or longer effects. People are clever, they want to maximize their own gain within boundaries set, and these things are set like this. Nobody works in banking for the passion for the job, everybody is in for the money involved, and an occasional feel of some power/influence (however pathetic this is, some people are wired like that).",1452866253

They get to prepare all of the video to stream in advance, optimize it for each screen size, transfer each variant it down to each ISP and then turn it on when it&#x27;s ready.

The position will be within EU funded project to develop new bioinformatics approaches that leverage system-level data for biotechnological applications.<p>With advances in synthetic biology, genomes can now be edited at unprecedented speed and fidelity allowing making multiple changes in the same genome at the same time. This increases the need for computational tools to design cells and communities of cells analogous to the tools used in Computer Aided Design (CAD) of cars, buildings and other man-made objects. The European Commission has awarded 6.3 million Euros to a four-year collaborative project to build such a CAD tool for data-driven design of cells and microbial communities.

Like any other payment service, the use of Bitcoin entails processing costs. Services necessary for the operation of currently widespread monetary systems, such as banks, credit cards, and armored vehicles, also use a lot of energy. Although unlike Bitcoin, their total energy consumption is not transparent and cannot be as easily measured. Bitcoin mining has been designed to become more optimized over time with specialized hardware consuming less energy, and the operating costs of mining should continue to be proportional to demand. When Bitcoin mining becomes too competitive and less profitable, some miners choose to stop their activities. Furthermore, all energy expended mining is eventually transformed into heat, and the most profitable miners will be those who have put this heat to good use. An optimally efficient mining network is one that isn&#x27;t actually consuming any extra energy. While this is an ideal, the economics of mining are such that miners individually strive toward it.",1452863342

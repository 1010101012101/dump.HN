8366669,comment,8365061,8366618,1,0,lisper,,,"Not really.  I think there is a useful place to draw a line and call it &quot;ownership&quot; even if there are some restrictions involved.  For example, I feel like it&#x27;s fair to say that I own my house and the land it sits on despite the fact that I have to pay rent on it (property taxes) and I can&#x27;t tear down the house and build a gas station instead.  But IMO, one of the necessary conditions for ownership is the ability to restrict access.  Again, I use cars as an analogy: if I can&#x27;t lock the doors and prevent people from sitting in the driver&#x27;s seat on a whim, I don&#x27;t think I can reasonably say I &quot;own&quot; the car.",1411646112

Well, then its outside of python program and instead of relying on subprocessing Id consider exposing that utility as an interface and writing a small protocl through which the python and utility can exchange data.

They&#x27;re very different languages at this point.<p>gcc&#x27;s C++ compiler doesn&#x27;t handle C past C89 either; you can&#x27;t use C99 features when compiling with g++. There is a separate C compiler that&#x27;s part of the GNU Compiler Collection, but then there&#x27;s also a Fortran and a Go compiler: gcc includes a lot of languages. MSVC++ doesn&#x27;t; it&#x27;s just a C++ compiler, not a Fortran or Java or C compiler. Linux norms are a bit more polyglot, so gcc is more polyglot than MSVC++ is.<p>I personally like C, so it&#x27;d be nice if Microsoft shipped a C compiler in addition to a C++ compiler, but they&#x27;ve chosen not to. As a result, the &quot;C&quot; you can write is precisely the C that is also valid C++, and you can&#x27;t use any features that aren&#x27;t valid C++. If you really want there to be a language &quot;C/C++&quot; again that all C++ compilers can be expected to handle, you&#x27;d have to convince the C++ standards committee to add C99 or C11 features to the next C++1x.",1411645689

The author does not address the fact that it is relatively easy to augment a TM with a physical RNG.

I have a feeling this issue may be key to the difficulty in producing machines that seem &quot;truly intelligent&quot; but I don&#x27;t currently have a clear grasp of this problem.<p>The author makes a great deal of use of the term &quot;consciousness&quot; without being very clear about what he means by it.

Property ownership is entirely a social construct that differs significantly across different cultures. I don&#x27;t see what basis you have for calling your preferred legal system the one true meaning of ownership.<p>Nobody really &#x27;owns&#x27; land anywhere. It&#x27;s always a set of rights granted to you by the government,  unless you are an absolute monarch yourself.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Reform_(Scotland)_Act_2003"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Reform_(Scotland)_Act_200...</a>",1411643131

Filtering out all environment variables starting with these four characters should be 100% effective, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Apache, sshd, sudo, dhclient, and others start filtering out values that start with precisely these four characters.<p>I don&#x27;t think these four characters at the start of an environment variable are common; if they were, this bug would have been found out much sooner.

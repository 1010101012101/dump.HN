645946,comment,645895,645895,0,0,sounddust,,,"He's totally missing the point of studying computer science.  It doesn't matter if you are using Linux or Windows during your studies; a proper education in CS will give you a foundation on which you can easily adapt to any platform, language, or environment.  My school was almost entirely Unix-based, and my first job was with Microsoft.  They weren't concerned at all about whether I was familiar with the Win32 API, C#, COM or anything similar - and this attitude was consistent across all new hires, not just college hires.   Most competent companies (the ones you want to work for) will recognize this as well.<p>But in any case, there are an enormous number of jobs that do not require knowledge of Microsoft-based technology.",1244386665

I just always thought of the people behind Wired as being smarter than me since they've had so many early successes, but I can see how they fail pretty clearly, and it seems like an even harder fail because they moved with such assurance and competence in the beginning.

645939,comment,641946,641946,0,0,ralph,,,"I had to set lots of `visible?', `touch sensitive?', etc., flags based on Boolean expressions.  I ended up with things like<p><pre><code>    foo->vis = a || (b || !c && (...)) && z;
</code></pre>
Coding standards, and the arbiters at code review, insisted on a nested set of if-then-else statements comparing, e.g. a == TRUE, rather than just `a', with the many blocks being either foo->vis = TRUE or FALSE as appropriate.<p>This resulted in my two or three line statements turning into many more lines, which then gave them cause for concern because their style had swelled functions to where they thought they were getting too large!<p>Plus, the C compiler, one of IBM's, produced better POWER code for my line than theirs.<p>I finally got them to back down when I gave them a code sample in their style for study.  Even when I pointed out it had an error they couldn't find it.  I'd deliberately missed an else-block off an if-statement that had started a dozen lines before.  This would mean foo->vis sometimes wasn't written to at all;  impossible with my version.",1244386107

This hardly seems like evidence against racial differences in intelligence/achievement.<p>(Note: I don't have a strong opinion on racial IQ differences, just pointing out the tricky wording in the article.

It's a great university, and I'm glad I chose to come here than try to apply for Oxbridge - I believe they are the best universities in the UK, but not by such a massive margin as people make out. If you say you're an Oxford student, anyone in the country will be impressed. Many people will not have heard of Warwick or Bristol university, or will assume they are just bog-standard institutions.<p>I have to disagree, though, with the comment that anyone with brains can get into Oxbridge - from what I've heard, they seem much more obsessed with preliminary interviews than other UK institutions - potential applicants stay for several days of interviews IIRC. Many private school kids get special tuition to pass these tests, which is an advantage that state school kids don't have.",1244384936

By comparison, going to a rather good state school, I got paid a net of around $8k per year to go to college.<p>The financial equation is different for every person, but the value add of a name-brand school over a state school is typically a hard sell--for a motivated student a decent education is available everywhere.",1244384497
645915,comment,645000,645248,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"> <i>America is far closer to a meritocracy than any other country.</i><p>If we're talking about politics - which is the reason that plutocracy is coming into play - then you're mistaken. As the other commentor points out, plutocracy means that money gives you political clout/power.<p>Compare the corruption rates in the US elections to a country like, say, Finland (which ranks lowest on corruption—that is, has the least). Go to Finland during an election and you'll see posters everywhere that feature tens of faces of people from every income level who are running for office. I can tell you that, as an American, this experience for me was not only surreal but almost disturbing.<p>Then look at the US, where the vast majority of politicians are rich to begin with and become only more enriched. Look at PACs, which use money to create voting blocs inside the governing bodies, and how lobbyists tend to write laws and then lawmakers simply sign them.<p>I remember reading an article in the NYT last fall, quoting a guy who heads up one of the international voting monitoring organizations. He said that the US is so bad, we don't even meet their minimum requirements for monitoring.<p>Money = power in the US. That hasn't changed much since its beginnings.<p>The sentiment that ""The US is bad, sure, but it's better than all the alternatives!"" is common here on HN (and among educated Americans in general). I really wish people would question it more and look at facts, and travel outside, to see that it's not true.<p>Maybe it feels like betrayal to say ""Actually, the US is just really bad,"" but how can you heal a major wound if you won't even admit that you're bleeding out long enough to apply some pressure?",1244384492

645911,comment,645451,645516,0,0,messel,,,"Thanks for the feedback pj, the experiences you had in school were fundamental to your learning the basics of computers.  I'd argue you could have learned much if not all of that on your own, or with some friends in less time than it took you to graduate. In addition things have changed so much in the past 20 years that the nand gates I used to play with in school don't aid me much in understanding modern digital circuitry, I have to keep reading and learning-> school was only the beginning.<p>My quick background: physics undergrad (then a MSEE).  It shouldn't have taken 6 years of my life to learn what I needed.  There were some incredible serendipitous finds, but the timeline is too long and the focus just wasn't there. By the end of my first year I was learning with friends in study groups and from books much more than I got out of class.  I learned coding on the job.  It was an engineering position so my school wasn't wasted per se.  But any Basic (on the TI99) or pascal toy coding I did beforehand did little to prepare me.  Real work experience was a powerful teacher.<p>Actually working with a group of software developers, following some standards, and working on my own small/easy sections of the code at first is what eventually cemented the process of coding.  But then there was the matter of design.<p>The design of structures, data flow, processes came from working problems that demanded real time (or near real time) efficiency. I learned with C++, and veered away from java for the speed issue.<p>Would you agree there is room for alternative learning besides college educations in preparation for tomorrow's workforce?",1244384217

I went from Chicago to Atlanta for my Father's wedding - what a to-do, great fun.  (TMI? :) )<p>In our eyes 10mpg is a huge savings.  Couple that with efficiency gains by utilizing lightweight materials, and boost that with a clean diesel with reduced emissions; for Local Motors, this is the way to move forward.  We are not looking for a one-time solution and we will get better as time goes on.  With each step, with each vehicle we can only hope to improve with each iteration.<p>Your views are well heard, and we are aware that many share your views on the type of engine which would be easiest to use and manipulate.  If we have made a mistake and the 335d is too difficult, the Rally Fighter is fit for 2 other engine opitons - among those is a plain ol' gasoline engine.  Not our favorite option, but we do hear you.<p>Laughed about the bat shit crazy ex girlfriend.  Thank you for that :)<p>Your words, ""Give the people a choice"" hits home.  The open development process at local-motors.com is exactly that - a forum for participation and choice.  While we can digest what you say in this space, the votes of our community members and dedicated participants are the votes and voices we follow.  We want your voice to be heard.  If you would prefer to wait for a vehicle that is more personal, one that you would use and have a personal vested interest in, I understand.  I don't think the desert racing segment is your cup o' tea.  But your opinion is so valuable, so consider yourself invited to take part.<p>RE: ""zero mainstream appeal"", the segment is certainly limited and the choice is intentional.  This is a segment in which we could build a product to have very clear improvements over anything else on the market.  A segment that is already building cars, and a segment that is passionate like you wouldn't believe.  We will build cars for the tarmac, for Jersey - but we will not, not, not build cars for the masses.  Please everyone, and you will eventually please no one.  The future of exciting products and cars is niche and supported by a hands-on experience.  Again, time will tell as to whether we are ""right"".  I hope you will stay close so we can hash out this conversation again as we grow, and as new niche local markets make their desires known.<p>I also want to note that I think all of your notes on the US auto industry and market potential are more or less right on.  There is space for not only more cars in the segments you mentioned, there is also room for more car companies.  I agree with you.<p>Trust that we have done our ""homework"", and our business model is viable on a local level w/ limited production for niche markets.  The changes you are suggesting we make (""build for mainstream enthusiast"", ""target millions"") would make us un-local motors - and that is not our goal.<p>This company and community is focused on creating a unique local experience for local enthusiasts.  Your suggestions & strategy may be viable, but it is not local.<p>Thanks again!<p>Ariel Ferreira<p>aferreira@local-motors.com",1244383254

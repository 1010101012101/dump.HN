It's based on the notion that being a good researcher and being good at reading and reviewing research papers are not necessarily the same skill.<p>1. Have a place for open publication, like arxiv.org, but with a system of non-anonymous commenting and rating. So if someone puts a paper there, others can comment on it and rate it. Ratings could include several categories, such as clarity, importance, rigor, and so on.<p>2. There should be a system to rate the reviewers.<p>3. Out of this would emerge a growing collection of reviewers who are recognized as being very good at reviewing papers.<p>4. Reviewers would start publishing lists of papers they have recently reviewed, broken down by field.<p>5. Scientists would subscribe to these lists from the top reviewers in their field.<p>6. Reviewing could become a profession. A researcher who wants to make sure his paper gets attention could pay one or more high rated reviewers to review it. Note that for reviewers it is important to maintain a reputation as an accurate and honest reviewer, which I think would be enough of a safe guard against authors being able to buy good reviews for bad papers.",1317204256

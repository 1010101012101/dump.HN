It's also the difference between 30 fps in a game vs. 15 fps - that is <i>really</i> noticeable.<p>The list goes on. A 2x performance penalty is <i>huge</i>. For desktop applications, our hardware is so ludicrously overpowered for what we do with it that this penalty large doesn't matter (as you said, 1ms vs. 2ms), but in mobile land, where hardware constraints are still very, very real, this is absolutely a critical issue still.<p>Apple's platform is by far the most responsive out of all of the current smartphones, and I think it'd be foolish to discount native code as one of the primary factors in this.

A smaller male population passing on its genes would cause a higher amount of genetic drift (a smaller population means that outliers have a larger effect on the genetic makeup the population), which would cause the Y chromosome to change at a faster rate (and it is already much more susceptible to change than the X chromosome).",1282863731

1637422,comment,1635809,1637321,0,0,jules,,,"I agree, but I don't see as big of a difference between theft and piracy. As a software developer people pirating it sure does feel like theft. It evokes exactly the same kind of feeling as when somebody stole something physical from me. And the actual results for me are the same too: it costs me time and money. Moreover, the grounds for making theft illegal are good-of-society arguments too. Of course there are some differences too.<p>Positive vs negative rights is just an artificial distinction. It doesn't make a difference to me as a software developer. About as interesting would be classifying things according to the letter they start with (T for theft and P for piracy). You can phrase copyright as a positive or a negative right, it's just a difference in the wording not an actual difference:<p>""Copyright is the right to stop other people copying your work.""<p>""Copyright is that you're not allowed to copy the work of people who don't want that.""<p>Note how this is exactly the same as with property rights.",1282863665

Why doesn’t it look exactly like the webpage? What’s going on?) It’s perfectly usable, even without a deep grasp of the concepts, but so are PDF viewers inside browsers.",1282863661

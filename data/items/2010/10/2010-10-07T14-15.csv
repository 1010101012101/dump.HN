On more than one occasion, one or another of our customers (always a different one) would call us and say that their product/service/organization/whatever was going to be ""mentioned"" on Oprah ""next week"", and could we please set up some extra phone-answering capacity for them in order to handle the inevitable spike in demand.<p>At first, we would try and accommodate their requests- bring in an extra operator or two, do a special answering script, etc. Besides being good customer service, we figured that increased usage on the part of our customer translated into more money for us, so it was worth spending some time on our end helping them get ready for a spike.<p>After a little while, however, we eventually stopped taking ""Oprah-induced capacity panics"" so seriously. Why was this? Because we never- not once- saw any serious spike in calls from any of our customers' Oprah ""mentions"".<p>I'd suggest planning for some extra capacity, just in case, but don't go doing too much special-purpose engineering work for this one customer.

You have a much more powerful tool for preventing ""prank"" photo tags/wall posts/group joins than Facebook could ever invent technologically: social pressure. To wit, these people are nominally your friends; even if you've been somewhat promiscuous, and they're just your coworker, or acquaintance, or distant family member, you still have much more leverage over their behavior than Facebook ever will.<p>So, if Joe Idiot tags you in a photo of a goat, or joins you in an embarassing group: a) untag/unjoin yourself, and b) tell Joe THAT WAS NOT COOL.

1768008,comment,1765002,1767738,0,0,ajju,,,"My comment was based on Mark's statements. The actual video is at [1]. Scroll forward to 1:26:30. I'll try to quote the relevant parts verbatim:<p>Reporter: ""Do you actually get your friends contact info as well. is any of the data in a format that can be easily imported?""<p>Mark: What we are focusing on today is your information...not your friends information, because that is not your information..<p>That clearly seems to me like they will be scrubbing not just IDs but also email addresses of my friends when I download my data. So when I take my data to a new service, I am not taking my friends with me. This means any new social network that I want to export my friend data to still has to go via the Facebook API. And what's the catch with that?<p>What Facebook doesn't allow anyone who uses their API to do is use data you get from them to target ads to users <i>even if the user consents</i>.<p>See their terms, 9.6, for developers:<p>You will not directly or indirectly transfer any data you receive from us to (<i>or use such data in connection with</i>) any ad network, ad exchange, data broker, or other advertising related toolset, <i>even if a user consents to that transfer or use</i>.<p>Further, the new social network, a Facebook competitor, would continue to be dependent on Facebook and any future changes to their TOS which they are forever subject to.<p>A bunch of people thought that with the user now free to export all their data and import it into a new social network, platforms competing with FB, who want to source data from FB, would be able to do so without consenting to Facebook's terms like the one above and permanently free them from future changes to Facebook's terms. Clearly that is not the case, since using the Graph API means you are still subject to these terms.<p>I was not making any statements about Facebook's confidence or lack thereof. And sure there is no credible competition at this point, but that's my point. Competition is good.<p>Finally, you said:<p><i>It was rude, and deliberately so...it is my duty to call attention to this situation. A downvote is not sufficient.</i><p>If you think that calling attention to factual inaccuracies requires being rude, I think you have misjudged HN as a discussion platform and, in my opinion, misunderstood the general rules of conversation as well. I'll leave it at that.<p>I never implied that people ""really want to leave Facebook"".

She isn't going to product.com, she is googling for [product], [product.com], [products], [praduct], [pro ducks], [what was that thing on Oprah this morning?], etc.<p>Step #2: Expect less traffic than you think, because while Oprah's audience is ginormous they are in TV watching mode rather than browsing the Internet mode, and large portions are going to fall out of the funnel in a) trying to go to your website and b) doing so successfully.  Oprah's peak audience is somewhere around 9 million people.  If you're expecting 500k visitors to your website, I think you're being overly optimistic (absent Oprah literally doing a call to action on your behalf).  So it isn't all that much worse than a Slashdotting, and you can expect the people to come in over a wider interval than ""right the second the URL appears on the screen"".  Any reasonable website can chew through 500,000 visits spread over a 48 hour interval if it survives the initial bump.<p>Step #3: Scale the obvious bottlenecks and get ready to do some firefighting, though you probably won't need to.  If the home page makes 10 SQL queries right now, a) fix and b) replace with static HTML for the day (or get a process in place where you can do that quickly if the server starts to chug).  I'd put a big Welcome Oprah Viewers banner at the top of it with a sales pitch leveraging that social proof for all you are worth and giving them ""special"" advice for using the site, by the way.<p>Step #4: Have a backup plan.  If it seems highly unlikely that you're going to survive, switch all or most users to a static site which explains that ""due to overwhelming popularity"" the service isn't available at the moment but you'll email them the second it comes back up if they just drop their email address into this MailChimp signup form.  Do so.  Give them an option from hearing from you in a less transient fashion, too.  (I would strongly consider ""Check if they're cookied for your site, if so let them in, if not give them the static pseudo-site"" but that doesn't scale to the moon like ""hello new client, here is index.html, bye"" does.)",1286461736

1767901,story,,,2,0,camz,"Appraising the Value of a College Degree in Dollars + Related Factors",,"Degree Economics: WTH is a Bachelor’s Degree Worth?<p>I’m a dollars and cents kind of guy and I like to cut the fat.  I’ve always been told that an education is the surest investment that I’d ever make because it’d pay off in spades.  I can say with absolute confidence that it is total BS after experiencing 14 different professions from the lowest levels of manual labor to sitting behind a desk at a white-shoe firm.<p>The value of degree is relative to the following factors:<p>(1)	The Major
The major is going to determine the future employment options available and the salary associated with that job.
Ex 1:  A degree in accounting will allow you to become an accountant (duh).
	Average starting salary:  $55,000 for an entry level accountant.
Ex 2:  A degree in biology will allow you to become a researcher or a future in medicine.
	Average starting salary: $42,000 for an entry level research associate.<p>(2)	School’s Reputation or Network Related to that Concentration
Most people don’t realize that an entry level position is usually easiest to come by, when we’re still in school.  Almost every Fortune 500 company is associated with one school or another.  These companies have specific schools where they give preferential treatment (thus a higher chance of getting a job).  So, the school’s reputation or network is going to be a huge factor in whether or not you even get the opportunity to interview with a company.<p>(3)	The Cost
Tuition has risen more than double the inflation rate, since 1986.  Education doesn’t come cheap these days and it’s a huge factor in whether a degree is worthwhile.
Ex:  Bob goes to Harvard (tuition alone: $35,568 and with estimated living costs: $59,680. Bob is going to have $142,272 in student loans after he graduates (assuming he never sleeps, eats, or buys books).  If Bob gets a job that earns $49,945 a year out of college (the median income for an entire family in the United States before tax), then he would be able to payoff his student loans in about 3 years (again, assuming he never sleeps or eats).<p>Realistically, Bob is going to pay the following for living expenses excluding all luxuries.<p>Federal Tax:	  $6,843
State Tax:	  $4,995
Rent:		  $10,644 ($877 per month for an one-bedroom)
Food:		  $2,400 ($200 per month maximum monthly foodstamp allowance)	
Total:		  $24,882 to survive per year.
Income:           $49,945 Median US income for an entire family (husband and wife) 
Expenses:	  $24,882 to survive per year						
Leftover:	  $25,063 to pay student loans per year with no social life.
Student Loans:	  $142,272 ignoring accumulating interest				
Leftover:	  $25,063<p>It will take Bob about 5 and a half years to payoff his student loans at Harvard.  Had Bob went to a public school; he would’ve paid $28,080 total ($7,020 per year) and been out of debt after about a year.<p>Conclusion:
Education is a lucrative business and colleges have an awesome business model.  It’s similar to the United States Treasury, they both print money!<p>I’ll be providing bi-weekly updates on what a college degree is worth on various majors and professions in dollars and cents.  Also, I will follow-up with the present value of the value future earnings as well.<p>*Figures are based upon data provided by the United States Census.<p>www.sketchoutschool.com",1286461460

If you do say no, then you'll just end up delivering an end product that isn't exactly what the client wanted and didn't have that feature they requested. I can't imagine any situation where that results in a happy client.<p>So what do you do? I say: <i>Get the client to say 'No' for you</i>.<p>Getting people to understand the trade-offs and sacrifices for what they might consider a ""quick 'n easy"" feature is the name of the game here. You've got to flesh out all the assumptions that they have when making such a request so that they understand what the impact is on schedule, budget, and code.<p>But what they still don't understand is <i>why</i> Projects X, Y, and Z will have to be pushed back for 2 weeks or <i>why</i> Joe and Mary will have to pulled away for 3 weeks just to do this ""quick"", ""simple"" thing. At this point, what I usually do is spec out the entire feature (front-loading all the mockups, copywriting, etc) on the spot or in a meeting immediately following. The reasoning is that ""If you want this feature tomorrow, then it has to be designed today."" And well, practically speaking, you can't implement it by tomorrow if you don't know what you need to do yet anyway and, worse still, you'll build the wrong thing if you don't at least discuss it in some detail with your client first.<p>If the feature isn't important enough to spec out in detail now, it's not important enough to be done by tomorrow.<p>In my experience as a solo webdev freelancer (so take it for what it's worth), clients usually see my point and give in when they realize that we're trying to compress about a week's worth of back and forth emails, phone calls, and let-this-idea-sink-in time into about an hour--sometimes even realizing that they don't really know yet what they want.",1286461406

There are differences in the implementation between different browsers but here's the gist: JS may modify the DOM if-and-only-if the domain containing the script shares the domain of the DOM. Loosely, the check is done by comparing <i>document.domain</i> strings. If the strings match, everything is kosher.<p>You can truncate <i>document.domain</i> by lopping off period delimited prefixes. Even if you lop foo.com down to the TLDs, you won't be able to do the same trick and cut bar.com down and get scripts to run in the same context.<p>If you're hosting content on blog.example.com and example.com, an attack on blog.example.com could truncate the document.domain down to 'example.com' and execute malicious script on the primary domain.<p>I would recommend using blog.example.com and www.example.com, but never example.com.",1286460518

Aside from their scary chemical properties, you should take into consideration that the people who are addicted to these drugs are often driven to desperate situations because of their illegal status and resulting cost. Having known several heroin addicts, it is not realistic that they would reduce their intake to opium willingly even if that meant they are within legal rights to do so. The same goes for cocaine; many people graduate beyond the use of cocaine to crack because simple powdered cocaine fails to fulfill their need or because their nasal cavities are too damaged to suffice.<p>What I am saying is that I believe your idea of waiting for the market for processed drugs to ""dry up"" will inevitably mean creating a class of drug users who will continue to be persecuted until they presumably die out.

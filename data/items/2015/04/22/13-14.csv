9420426,comment,9419188,9419188,0,0,exelius,,,"System administration is as important as ever. Docker and other containers just simplify system administration across many different machines. The standard Unix user land tools are excellent and very flexible, but they are fucking god awful at configuration management. Docker solves the problem of &quot;how do I make sure I have the same versions and configurations of everything on all 500 of my compute nodes without having to lock them down completely?&quot; This question is meaningless if your base system image sucks, so you still need a proper sysadmin to build your Docker images.<p>Many places are rolling this type of sysadmin work up into DevOps. This scares graybeard sysadmins, because they see DevOps automating them out of a job. What they fail to see is that DevOps is a step up for them: it&#x27;s an explicit admission that system administration is as important as software development, and needs to be integrated into the software development process and managed through whatever management processes and tools the core dev team uses.<p>The ultimate driver behind this is a shift in the way technology organizations are managed. A few years ago, you would have functional silos: development, operations, product, etc. that would all contribute to one or more products. Employees reported up through the functional lead, and incentives were doled out based on cost effectiveness. This didn&#x27;t work well. So what started happening is that engineering executives began building product-focused silos instead. A development manager is no longer in charge of just software developers, but also QA, scalability and deployment. If the operations folks fuck up the deployment, the development manager gets chewed out about it. So the dev manager is going to bring as much of that under her control as she can.<p>Docker/Maven/etc. are the abstraction layer between the teams that manage the infrastructure (physical servers, VMWare pools, storage, network, etc) and the teams that manage the applications. This is no excuse for bad sysadmin practices; you still need good sysadmins in the DevOps role. But here&#x27;s the kicker: DevOps often pays more than system administration! And if you&#x27;re a SME in a very specific thing (say, Cassandra administration) you can be in a support role across a number of different teams, making sure their DevOps folks deploy Cassandra in a sane way.<p>(Yes, I realize all of this is centered on huge companies with massive engineering organizations. Small organizations have always required sysadmins to wear multiple hats, so none of this is new.)",1429711179

Basically. It&#x27;s perfectly possible to &#x27;yum upgrade&#x27; or &#x27;apt-get upgrade&#x27; them.<p>I <i>think</i> what you&#x27;re trying to say is this is a bad idea because containers are not supposed to be managed individually. The magical fluffy dream of Docker is to never have to manage another individual OS again; just make one image, then kick it out to all your machines and make them use the new image. No resolving dependencies, no verifying individual file checksums, no upgrading or downgrading or conflicting different package versions for every server and service. Just do it once, and then push it out everywhere, and everything magically works.<p>Right?<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: Containers don&#x27;t do away with the idea that a developer might use a totally bleeding-edge piece of software to update one of your many apps, and that you may end up with multiple incompatible versions of software on your systems. In fact, Docker kind of trades on that as a feature. &quot;Install any shit software you want and it&#x27;ll never conflict with other containers!&quot; But this lie is shown for what it is once you start looking at containers as individual physical machines.<p>Back in the day we had to &#x27;yum install some-specific-architecture-and-version-of-this-package&#x27; on a particular machine to make that machine serve that software. You do the same with Docker, because you have a particular Docker container with a specific version of the package, and all the other packages and OS requirements in that container. You still have a one-off machine to install, maintain and troubleshoot. The only differences are it isn&#x27;t physical anymore, and you perform updates on the image, not on the machine.<p>Just like you ended up with a machine (or three machines) with three different versions of BDB, you end up with three containers with three different versions of BDB. Instead of using &#x27;apt&#x27; or &#x27;yum&#x27; to install them, you write their Dockerfiles and build them, test them, then roll out their updated images. You do a lot more from scratch now because a Linux distro hasn&#x27;t done the work for you, and so you also run into all the headaches that someone packaging software for a Linux distro usually runs into.<p>One of the worst things about the &#x27;new devops way&#x27; seems to be the non-reproducibility of things like Dockerfiles. To build a Docker image we slap together whatever bleeding-edge files we had on date X-Y-Z, and whatever comes out at the end is considered &#x27;production&#x27;. Ignoring the patches, the quality control, the stable released software distributed by distributions on reliable mirrors, and generally without tuning the software at all for the particular system you&#x27;re running it on. Try to build that Dockerfile again in a year and suddenly it doesn&#x27;t work the same as it used to, or a bug magically appears on your production system, or you have to apply a patch and now you need to unroll all the commands used for individual stages of the build process for a single package and figure out how to make it still work like the original was built, etc.<p>Containers by themselves are fine things to use. The problem is how they&#x27;ve effectively sold a lie to everyone that uses them: that there is no sysadmin work to be done. That don&#x27;t worry, Mr. Javascript Dev, you too can build infrastructure and deploy it without learning the many lessons and best practices of an industry that has been here longer than you&#x27;ve been alive.<p>This wouldn&#x27;t even be far from the truth if it was, say, a RedHat-built set of container images, or a Debian-built set of container images. Then at least there&#x27;d be an expert who&#x27;s building software in a reliable uniform way and along a particular standard. They would provide you the software updates, and even provide you with tools and instructions on how to use them to manage your whole software infrastructure without having to write software yourself.<p>In the age of &#x27;everyone should learn to code&#x27;, everything can be fixed by writing more code, and copy-and-pasting binaries built on a developer&#x27;s desktop counts as production deployment. [To be fair, developers were doing this 10 years ago with Java apps, and we hated it]",1429710533

He&#x27;s written books and everything. He built an algorithm to make a distributed system of equal peers figure out when it needed to start more nodes, or could shut some of them down. He wrote a proof, in code. He wrote a paper. When in production, the system would not work as advertised, and he blamed it on other pieces, because the algorithm was proven correct! So the problem stayed there for months.<p>After he left the company, I decided to figure the problem out, so I read through the proofs, the paper, and the code: All the single letter variables you could possibly want. I figured out that yes, the algorithm was flawless, as long as every operation in the system was atomic and instantaneous. Instead of the proof, I built a small simulator that didn&#x27;t have such flawed assumptions, and got the exact same behavior as the production system. So the proof was perfect, as long as we made assumptions that are impossible in our universe. And the entire algorithm was less than 200 lines of code.<p>So whenever we have a reality that is difficult to model (and let me tell you, distributed systems fit the bill), dependent types will not save you, haskell or no haskell.

It&#x27;s kind of wacky that Aphyr compared those replicated consensus tools and eventually consistent stores with HBase.  HBase does not use a consensus protocol for replication, it uses HDFS.  HBase is not eventually consistent.  There is a single authoritative server for reads and writes of a lexicographic range of keys (a region) which writes immutable store files and a WAL to HDFS.  Partial availability may be achievable for reads with a significant amount of effort and latency and limiting of total cluster size by allowing non-authoritative regionservers to read the HDFS WAL + Storefiles, but this really isn&#x27;t realistic.  I&#x27;ve personally been burned by the client retry thing though, and there&#x27;s not really a better solution when you consider the types of workloads HBase is actually used for and it&#x27;s incredibly variable latency (it aims only for consistency and very high AVERAGE throughput, at the cost of extremely high HIGHEST latency).  One solution here could be the use of a configurable filesystem queue for clients.  This is how you build resilient high-throughput pipelines.  HBase is used in some places for OLTP, but only when the readload is very very low.  So the effort to make reads more highly available would be in vain.",1429709217

Containers aren&#x27;t making us dumber either.<p>A good sys admin just knows all of the working parts of a server and knows about the latest tools. The only way to get better is hands on practice. Try setting up your own Hadoop cluster from source and run a job through it, then put Hive on it, then attempt to containerize a node ... which not even work but learning why that won&#x27;t work becomes useful knowledge.

For instance when a packet coming from the internet arrives at your gateway, how does it travel from there to it&#x27;s final destination and how does it travel back? Write down at every hop the port/subnet/netmask/gateway for both the incoming and (if applicable) the outgoing interface. Works great for finding connection issues.<p>Document your infrastructure.

The problem is you run into something that requires the full computer (usually due to screen size like a video tutorial that’s too tall to watch on the Eee PC).  So now you’re supposed to stay in bed but your computer's just 4 ft away and you really want to watch this video (or whatever).<p>Maybe others here just have more self control but for me having the netbook is just  a recipe for disaster.",1233954351

You can always lower the price in the future, although raising it is a bit harder.<p>One thing to do would be to compare what your app does with the one that costs 300/month, and what yours does compared to the one that costs 14/month. Where does your app fit in?<p>How much are you looking to make? How much are your costs per customer and costs per month? The basic way to price is to add up your fixed costs (rent, hosting, marketing, etc) and the cost per month for providing the software, and then add in a healthy profit margin. That's how much you should charge.<p>There are a lot of other pricing mechanisms, including how much money your software will save the customer, how much value they perceive it to have, etc. You could always start high and just keep lowering the price until you reach the ratio of customers to price that you want.",1233954270

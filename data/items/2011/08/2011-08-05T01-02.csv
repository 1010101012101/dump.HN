2848669,comment,2846549,2847153,3,0,alttag,,,"I've had similar concerns with many articles as the GP (as clarified in the sibling comment): namely that so much of it is a clash of ideologies, and it's inconstant with my own. I don't have the time or inclination to deal with ideologuesI had enough of that as an elected public education official.<p>As a specific example, consider the pregnancy article already under question. In my mind, a reasonable compromise would be to move to image (not <i>re</i>move it) and put it behind a link labeled ""image of nude pregnant woman"" or a mask (like the spoiler codes in game forms) or some other easily identifiable method. I won't argue whether images like that has value or not [1], but the clash between opposing moral standards (if you'll pardon the potentially charged term) is pervasive in the talk pages.<p>There are some images that I don't feel the need to look at, and more particularly, don't wish <i>my</i> young children to look at. I understand that not everyone feels that way (I'm not telling anyone how to raise their kids), but by placing such images front-and-center, I feel blindsided or robbed of the choice to seek out such things. Yet on Wikipedia, this sort of perspective is consistently rejected (""No censorship!""). I see it as the amoral being preferred to the moral, and I'm uncomfortable supporting an organization that consistently acts in such a way. In recognition of opposing views I'm not suggesting that images like this be removed--just labeled or easily masked so that I can choose to see it if I want, and similarly choose <i>not</i> to.<p>I'm not trying to push my view on others, but Wikipedia (as embodied by its editors) pushes its view on me.<p>1: It seemed to me from the talk page that some of those in favor of keeping the nude pictures had emotional attachments to the image rather than objective reasoning.",1312509579

2848666,comment,2846549,2848010,1,0,bane,,,"I'm taking your reasonable tone w/r to the application of the notability <i>guidelines</i> with a grain of salt.<p>I find it fascinating that whenever a WP deletionist bothers to engage with the world outside of WP, they act like everything they do is perfectly reasonable and justified. Yet you and I both know that the actual reality is that its virtually impossible to add knowledge/contribute to WP these days without having that material deleted...often within minutes.<p>Here's a perfect, relatively recent example <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2215168"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2215168</a><p>The original person who nominated these for deletion did it in bad faith, and the admins treated it like a legitimate deletion -- as if he had nominated litter like ""xryzcbslmrwp463vnfd"" for deletion. However, reasonable people viewed the entire debacle not as cleaning up the litter off the street, but the same as destructive vandalism and were right to do so.<p>Yeah, sure, after an interminable, and completely opaque process, involving two (2) rounds of discussion, the articles were restored (after first being deleted). But in every case involving the original deletion by an admin, there was both ample reference material verifying the content of the articles, <i>and</i> a clear consensus to keep the articles.<p>I bring this up not because it's unusual, or I have a particular axe to grind regarding the inclusion/exclusion of languages in WP, but because it's absolutely typical of the kind of crap not only new users have to suffer through, but even active contributors.<p>Point being, contributing to WP is a waste of time, with hours and hours of work being hauled off to /dev/null at the whim of an overzealous editor with some kind of chip on their shoulder.<p>The current crop of admins and editors on the site seem to be suffering from the mistaken that the point of WP is not to collect the world's knowledge, but to replicate a 19th century print encyclopedia that just ""happens"" to have a few pop-culture topics in them, completely oblivious to the magnificent advancements of modern technology.<p>And like any in-group, the highly embedded clique of admins and editors refuse to self-police, instead they'll reinforce the bad decisions of their brothers-in-arms.<p>WP had <i>so</i> much promise, but it's taken half a decade for any of the people who actually run the site to finally notice this culture of nepotism, laziness, exclusion and failure that's completely permeated the site.",1312509535

2848648,comment,2848516,2848570,1,0,matthiasb,,,"Thanks for the feedback. I did not think about this.<p>Some of the square edges actually belongs to the surroundings squares because the cut is not 100% accurate and the chess piece are not always position at the center of the square but I could get around that.<p>The way this algorithm works is simple. I compare the RGB values for each pixel of a square to the black color and white color. Black is Red=0, Green=0, Blue=0 and white is Red=255, Green=255 and Blue=255. I add up the 3 RGB values for a pixel, if it is closer to 0 and 255*3, I consider the pixel is mostly black. I keep a counter of black pixels and another for white pixels.<p>Currently, the algo is just comparing the two counters. If I found most of the pixel were black, I consider it is a black square.<p>However, I could improve it as following:
- > 90% of black pixels: empty black square or black square with black piece
- > 90% of white pixels: empty white square or white square with white piece
- other white: square with a piece of the opposite color.<p>For the 3rd case, I might need to implement your idea.",1312509075
2848647,comment,2848239,2848239,32,0,nirvana,,,"If you're interested in keeping up to date with the project I describe below, please follow me on twitter @NirvanaCore.<p>I had many of the same concerns with node.js.  Every time I attempted to wrap my head around how I'd write the code I needed to write, it seemed like node was making it more complicated.  Since I learned erlang several years ago, and first started thinking about parallel programming a couple decades ago, this seemed backwards to me.   Why do event driven programming, when erlang is tried and true and battle tested?<p>The reason is, there isn't something like node.js for erlang, and so I set out to fix that.<p>For about a year I've been thinking about design, and for a couple months I've been implementing a new web application platform that I'm calling Nirvana.  (Sorry if that sounds pretentious. It's my personal name- I've been storing up over a decades worth of requirements for my ""ideal"" web framework.)<p>Nirvana is made up of an embarrassingly small amount of code.  It allows you to build web apps and services in coffeescript (or javascript) and have them execute in parallel in erlang, without having to worry too much about the issues of parallel programming.<p>It makes use of some great open source projects (which do all the heavy lifting): Webmachine, erlang_js and Riak.  I plan to ship it with some appropriate server side javascript and coffee script libraries built in.<p>Some advantages of this approach: (from my perspective)<p>1) Your code lives in Riak.  This means rather than deploying your app to a fleet of servers, you push your changes to a database.<p>2) All of the I/O actions your code might do are handled in parallel.  For instance, to render a page, you might need to pull several records from the database, and then based on them, generate a couple map/reduce queries, and then maybe process the results from the queries, and finally you want to render the results in a template.  The record fetches happen in parallel automagically in erlang, as do the map/reduce queries, and components defined for your page (such as client js files, or css files you want to include) are fetched in parallel as well.<p>3) We've adopted Riak's ""No Operations Department"" approach to scalability.  That is to say, every node of Nirvana is identical, running the same software stack.  To add capacity, you simply spin up a new node.  All of your applications are immediately ready to be hosted on that node, because they live in the database.<p>4) Caching is built in, you don't have to worry about it.  It is pretty slick- or I think it will be pretty slick-- because Basho did all the heavy lifting already in Riak.  We use a Riak in-memory backend, recently accessed data is stored in RAM on one of the nodes.  This means each machine you add to your cluster increases the total amount of cache RAM available.<p>5) There's a rudimentary sessions system built in, and built in authentication and user accounts seem eminently doable, though not at first release. Also templating, though use any js you want if you don't like the default.<p>So, say, you're writing a blog.  You write a couple handlers, one for reading an article, one for getting a list of articles and one for writing an article.  You tie them to /, /blog/article-id, and /post.  For each of these handlers, any session information is present in the context of your code.<p>To get the list of articles, you just run the query, format the results as you like with your template preference and emit the html. If it is a common query, you just set a ""freshness"" on it, and it will be cached for that long.  (EG: IF you post new articles once a week, you could set the freshness to an hour and it would pull results from the cache, only doing the actual query once an hour.)<p>To display a particular article, run a query for the article id from the URL (which is extracted for you) and, again this can be cached.   For posting, you can check the session to see if the person is authorized, or the header (using cookies) and push the text into a new record, or update an existing record.  Basically this is like most other frameworks, only your queries are handled in parallel.<p>The goal is to allow rapid development of apps, easy code re-use, and easy, built-in scalability, without having to think much about scalability, or have an ops department.<p>This is the very first time I've publicly talked about the project. I think that I'm doing something genuinely new, and genuinely worth doing, but its possible I've overlooked something important, or otherwise embarrassed myself.  I don't mean to hijack this thread, but felt that I needed to out my project sometime. A real announcement will come when I ship.<p>If you're interested in keeping up to date with the project I describe above, please follow me on twitter @NirvanaCore.<p>EDIT TO ADD:  
-- This uses Riak as the database with data persisted to disk in BitCask.  The Caching is done by a parallel backend in Riak (Riak supports multiple simultaneous backends) which lives in RAM.  So, the RAM works as a cache but the data is persisted to disk.",1312509071
2848646,comment,2848041,2848041,5,0,imperialWicket,,,"I have used a similar technique for teaching competitive croquet. Instead of this one simple rule, I offered three.  The first two rules pertain to strict technique and croquet theory (similar to the specifics about not leaving pieces hanging, and structuring your opening moves).  The third rule is always: don't F up your shot.<p>In the chess example, I reconfigured the 'don't do stupid shit', to something like, a) Open with an intent, b) Don't lose pieces without purpose, and c) Do everything for a purpose.  I wanted to add this information to the thread, because I think the 'don't F up your shot' croquet analog includes a more explicit sense of limiting your actions based on your ability.  In croquet, all the theory and mental prowess in the world is sacrificed if you can't execute the ideal shot under the circumstances.  This is acknowledgement of your current ability is what I think applies to much of programming (and life).<p>Note that I am NOT suggesting that you avoid moving your abilities forward.  However, focus a lot of effort on knowing what you know, and learn how to use it well.  The more you use it, the more you learn and expand on that skill set.  The more carefully you use what is within the realms of that skill set, the fewer mistakes (and the more successes) you will have.",1312509040

Google would be screwed out of mobile search revenue in a big way, esp. if Bing/iSearch/xyz are close enough to Google.<p>>Your argument for maps and finance is stronger, but the analogy isn't great. For one, Google doesn't have close to the monopoly that MS had. For another, it's really hard to draw the line between the products, and equally hard to say whether Google's use of its search engine to point to its own services is unfair, if it really believes its own products are better. I would characterize their position on this issue as still some distance from MS + IE on the 'fair' to 'unfair' spectrum, but still in 'fair' territory.

One of the fundamental teaching examples is why it's better to avoid a loss than make a gain:<p>Say you start with $100 and take a 50% loss down to $50. Now, what percentage gain will it take to get you back to $100?  Many people new to the game will unthinkingly answer a symmetrical 50% gain, but of course that's wrong.  To get from $50 back to $100, you need a 100% gain.<p>For every loss, getting back to even requires asymmetrically more % gain.  I imagine poker players are very aware of this harsh fact as well.<p>There's even an old misquoted Japanese/Chinese proverb that hints at it - <i>If you sit by the river long enough, you'll see the body of your enemy float by.</i>  Implying the power of doing nothing and letting your adversary shoot themselves in the foot.

Apple has taken a technology- metal milling- that has existed for at least half a century, and used it to make a nicer laptop case.<p>2. Apple uses the modern manufacturing method to do this, requiring expensive CNC machines.<p>3. Apple introduced popular products that, when you open them, look like they were hand crafted by master metalworkers in the 1940s (I'm serious!) while their competition is still shipping cheap plastic cases.<p>4. Even though there are dozens of suppliers of CNC Mills of all type, Apple's requirements contain the market for a particular type (this is speculation on my, and the articles part.)<p>5. Therefore, this is ""anti-competitive"" because Apple's competition can't just copy the unibody case idea and order machines and make their own unibody cases?<p>6. So, what could possibly be the remedy?  To fine Apple for  being successful with an innovative new case design?  To institute some government board of allocation to allocate the (currently, and only temporarily) limited supply of CNC machines?<p>If Apple hadn't been competitive-- that is, if Apple hadn't innovated and come up with a new case design-- there would be no demand for these machines from non-Apple people.  So, this is a result of competition on Apple's part.<p>Sometimes I imagine that people think that if Apple is successful by doing something better, that this is ""unfair"" and that Apple should be punished.<p>Hell, I wish I could make a crapy video editor and then force Apple to give me some of their final cut profits, because, really, it is so unfair that apple makes such a good video editor, I'm just one guy and I can't hope to compete with that, right?

A solid block of material enters, and the finished product emerges.<p>Inside the CNC mill, a variety of rapidly spinning milling cutters (think of an intelligent Dremel tool) cut out the part. The work piece is stationary (for the most part) and the tool head moves. A typical CNC machining center will have an automatic tool changer so that it can cut with a variety of different milling cutters (bits) as it performs various cutting operations.<p>In contrast, a lathe (manual or CNC) rotates the work piece (typically a cylindrical piece of metal, or bar stock, such as square or hex stock) and a non-rotating cutting tool trims excess material.<p>Now with that out of the way, the story is a bit suspect. What's to prevent the competition from buying their own factory with 10,000 CNC machining centers? Or bankrolling their preferred vendor to do so?",1312506095

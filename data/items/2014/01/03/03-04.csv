But with mobile networks and java clients, things can be different. Mobile networks commonly have very few resolvers and so few answers in the mix to distribute load, and some versions of java cache answers forever by default.<p>Here&#x27;s the hack we use to help with these situations! when you control the client it will help, it&#x27;s something we&#x27;ve worked with some mobile app authors on. With Route 53 (and hopefully Dyn too, I&#x27;m not sure), you can configure a wildcard name to be a series of weighted entries, backed by health checks. So instead of;<p><pre><code>   ping.chartbeat.net weight=1 answer=192.0.2.1 healthcheck=111\n   ping.chartbeat.net weight=1 answer=192.0.2.2 healthcheck=222\n</code></pre>\nit can be configured as;<p><pre><code>   *.ping.chartbeat.net weight=1 answer=192.0.2.1 healthcheck=111\n   *.ping.chartbeat.net weight=1 answer=192.0.2.2 healthcheck=222\n</code></pre>\nso pretty much the same, but then you have the client look up;<p><pre><code>   [ some random nonce / guid ].ping.chartbeat.net\n</code></pre>\nand voilà - you have busted any intermediate cache, and load is also spread more evenly (there are usually many more clients than DNS resolvers).<p>Self-promotion: If you do choose to use ELB and Route 53, we also support wildcard ALIASes to ELBs, and the queries are handled free of charge.",1388721075

There isn&#x27;t always a trade off, some people can just work more before losing capacity.

7004020,comment,7000686,7003938,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> You really are overthinking it. Context and intent will always have a place in the law.<p>But there is a difference between the definition of a crime and the intent to meet that definition.<p>Let&#x27;s try an analogy. Suppose I go to a local retailer and tell the clerk that I&#x27;m a professor at the local university and ask her to record the name, address, credit card number and other information of everyone who buys something in the shop for me today because I want to collect some statistics. There are now two issues here.<p>The first issue is whether the clerk agrees to provide me with the information. The shop owner and the credit card company need for her to not agree to this because it is clearly a security vulnerability. Even if I really am a professor collecting statistics for my research, she can&#x27;t know that for certain, and I could be a scam artist out to commit credit card fraud. But let&#x27;s suppose the clerk hasn&#x27;t been properly trained and she gives me the credit card numbers. The obvious analogy is to a misconfigured web server.<p>At this point it matters quite a lot what I do with the credit card numbers. If I&#x27;m a scam artist and start making fraudulent charges to the cards, there ought to be significant penalties. But if I really am out to do statistical analysis on local retailer purchasing behavior, should there be? Or should the retailer just take the opportunity to retrain the staff? There is a strong case for a lack of penalties -- because intent <i>does</i> matter. Which is the fundamental problem with the CFAA. It doesn&#x27;t require the intent to commit a malicious act, only a vaguely defined lack of authorization to commit any act regardless of whether or not the act is malicious.",1388720577

I refuse his refund request and say that I will offer him the market value of the item because he has had it for a month or he can have Butterfly replace it and I will pay all associated costs.  He replies that he will accept the price less $300 because he mined for 10 days and that is what he earned...I immediately call BS again and point out he originally said it arrived DOA.

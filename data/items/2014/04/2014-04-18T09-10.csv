I understand these are key security holes and are absent for a reason, but in my view being able to enable these would have been an acceptable compromise between usability and security - the reality is that my personal security situation is not so critical that I am going to go without these modern conveniences, but I would still like to make it as difficult as possible for attackers otherwise.<p>Surely Qubes even <i>with</i> these security holes would be better than vanilla Linux?

Later a lot more Latin American Authors including Borges, Huan Rulfo, Carpentier, Manuel Puig, Fuentes,Cortazar, Paz etc. became popular among the reading public in my region, but GGM was the one who started it all and remains one of my favourite writers of 20th century.

Soft copies were not available, as the architects considered their designs to be proprietary.  But of course we the fabricators would benefit from having the design in CAD so we could produce different views and so on.<p>One day I received a set of drawings for a three-dimensional arrangement of glass sort of like a bay window.  There were plan (overhead) and elevation (side) views, and I stared at those for a while, unable to make a coherent 3D model to match them.  I then took some cardboard and cut it out in the shapes shown on the drawings.  The shapes did not actually fit together--any way you tilted the pieces, there would be unworkable gaps in some part.<p>This was at the time when a lot of drawings were still made in 2D, with manual work to align the different views.

Cool to hear Singularity inspired you as well.<p>Now I didn&#x27;t read the paper, but I think the 20% is purely the MMU, I think the protection ring switching thing is much less significant, so I think if you leave the MMU still on that 20% profit is still very optimistic.<p>Now, if you forget about compiling C (which defeats the purpose of your talk) and just compile managed languages like regular JS, the garbage collector can build a great model of memory usage. Therefore I think it could be much better to let the garbage collector manage both the isolation, and the swapping. So everything in software.<p>The swapping process would suffer some performance, but that&#x27;s just CPU cycles, as everyone knows persistent data access isn&#x27;t even in the same league as CPU memory access.<p>So yeah, that would mean that you would have to run <i>all</i> untrusted code in managed mode.

Yahoo is absolutely massive, and their sites now have <i>more unique desktop users than any other web company</i> is the US — Google and Facebook included. If anything, they have <i>won</i> the battle for web supremacy.<p>They&#x27;re not that popular in the tech bubble – but there are hundreds of millions of other people in the US who are clearly using Yahoo.

When it comes to the product design, the visual designers have spoke, and that is that.

You can then hover over the >>links in any post to see a floating preview of the post in question, or click the link to be taken to the post directly. Any links to your posts have (You) next to them to make it easier to know when someone is replying to you. At the top of every post is a link to every post that linked to it. In addition, if you&#x27;re replying to a large post, or one that contained multiple side conversations in it, it&#x27;s common courtesy to include a <i>small</i> literal quote under the quote link.<p>Put it all together and a typical thread might look something like this:<p><pre><code>  Anonymous No. 1   Replies: >>2, >>3\n    I like posting here a lot better than posting on Hacker news.\n  \n  Anonymous No. 2\n    For what reason, >>1_(You)?\n\n  Bob Saget No. 3   Replies: >>4\n    >>1_(You)\n    I don&#x27;t really like multi-threaded discussion models either.

Way too hard for me to follow.\n    I strongly disagree, you are stupid.\n</code></pre>\nWith this system, I find it very easy to navigate anything from month-long threads with medium to large sized posts and very linear conversations, to threads that last a few hours and accumulate hundreds of small to medium sized posts that span dozens of simultaneous conversations.<p>>I also like the way Reddit notifies you of replies. It helps you avoid missing replies in the mess of a large thread.<p>4chan has a few similar systems. You can set a thread to automatically update every few seconds, or you can &quot;watch&quot; a thread so that even if you close the tab, you can see when new posts arrive. Also, in addition to the (You) next to links to your posts, when a thread updates, any posts that link to your posts are colored differently until you scroll past them. So these systems make it easy to follow entire threads in progress, not just the people directly talking to you.<p>I totally get that 4chan and company are not everyone&#x27;s thing, but I don&#x27;t understand why very few sites that aren&#x27;t already 2chan or futaba clones borrow elements from its design.

What do you think is the right thing to do, both for yourself (how much time and money do you have?) and your audience?<p>A way to promote the new app inside the old app:<p>- Add a button that says, &quot;new features!&quot; that you keep updated whenever you 1) release new bug fixes or features to either the regular or the beefed up version. This way, all users of the regular app will stay updated on whats going on in both the regular and the beefed up versions. Many of them will buy the beefed up version.",1433296533

9650139,comment,9642665,9648166,0,0,crdb,,,"Freedoms are not &quot;inherent&quot;. If you put humans in a desert, the strongest will eventually rule the weakest, and people will be unequal before the law. You certainly won&#x27;t get &quot;freedom&quot; under any definition I know of the term.<p>To be more specific, I define individual rights as encompassing the right to conduct any activity you wish so long as you do not infringe on other&#x27;s rights (including the commons, which are occasionally left out of Western definitions and particularly well managed in Singapore). Rights require enforcement, so that the man with the biggest stick does not get to violate the rights of others. Every man equal before the law, a concept pioneered by the Magna Carta, refined by John Locke, and implemented most famously by the Founding Fathers of the United States (for the first time in the history of mankind, without compromise or exception). Most people, except for some libertarian anarchists, agree that this is the proper role of government, that it should have a monopoly on force for that reason.<p>A people gets together and defines a set of rules to create a state and government that will enforce these individual rights at the exclusion of all other entities, with every man equal before the law. The government&#x27;s purpose becomes the enforcement of individual rights, and its &quot;freedom index&quot; can be measured by both its efficiency in enforcing rights for all, and its degree of infringing rights. This is implemented via justice, which arbitrages disputes, the police, which enforces the decisions, and the army which protects citizen against external threats to rights infringment. The casus belli makes it necessary to infringe rights to a certain extent by confiscating property in order to finance enforcement, the extent of infringement depending on the expense required, with conscription being the most extreme and desperate measure.<p>The early United States were pretty extremist about it, with no (national) Navy for almost a decade (and Jefferson being opposed to one permanently) until the Barbary pirates forced the government to raise what were initially one-off taxes to create what became a standing Navy in 1794. Even during WWII, the government preferred issuing war bonds than increasing taxes to finance the war effort.<p>How does Singapore fit into this? The degree of rights infringement to which the government lends itself is always justified. Conscription? Well, both neighbours are or were hostile states and the region is not exactly a mainstay of political stability, but Singapore&#x27;s enormous and well funded armed forces are a very powerful deterrent. Is it necessary today? That&#x27;s a long debate which the Singaporeans are continuously having, with the conclusion so far being yes. The chewing gum ban? A pragmatic decision implemented as the lowest cost solution to damage being done to the private property of SMRT corporation and the annoyance of its millions of customers (who happen to be citizen).<p>The tough penalties for drug trade? They stem from a long history of drug use in Asia creating significant costs for the commons be it in increased crime or in broken populations, we&#x27;re not talking about Valley developers enjoying a spliff in their basement whilst watching the latest Silicon Valley, we&#x27;re talking opium addicts in Clarke Quay overlooking the brackish waters of the Singapore River then famous for its stink.<p>The freedom of speech restrictions? They fit in basically two categories: national safety (such as those making racist speech illegal, preserving the country from flashpoints such as the 1964 riots), and libel. On the latter, the world is a big place and Singapore is small; if there was value in the libel suits (such as the recent CPF debate), why wasn&#x27;t the information released abroad? The foreign media loves a Singapore-critical story and would have a field day giving PR to any valid criticism.<p>Libel exists for a reason, which is that real damage is caused by unfounded rumors (see aforementioned Herman Cain campaign last primary), and citizen and entities ought to legally be able to protect themselves against such damage, which they aren&#x27;t in many Western countries where well placed campaigns can rapidly destroy someone without much consequence for the rumor spreader.<p>Citizen being exiled? All the ones I had a look at were openly communist or had ties to communists; in the 1960s, those were effectively enemy agents in a state of war, Mao&#x27;s teams set off thousands of bombs in neighbouring Hong Kong and Suharto&#x27;s way of dealing with the &quot;problem&quot; in Indonesia was to slaughter over half a million people with suspected ties to the PKI; let&#x27;s not even talk about Latin America and things like Condor. I think exile is a comparatively much more acceptable way to deal with such opposition than systematic murder, and this is a credit to LKY&#x27;s management of such crises.<p>Where Singapore shines, in an almost unique way globally (Switzerland might fit to an extent) is in the degree to which it does not impede the freedom to trade. I think the most important part of that today is the freedom of movement and doing business with foreigners, via the visa policy and lack of minimum wage. Friedman thought minimum wage would increase unemployment, but its real effect in the United States was to push around 11 million workers into illegality (80% of unskilled workers), and thus severe curtailment of their rights (when you are scared of La Migra, you do not go to the police). Singapore considers foreign citizen as guests, with rights granted on an increasing basis depending on salary. It&#x27;s a visionary policy which is rarely commented upon because immigration is a loaded subject, because the real topic of immigration is one of cultural and racial replacement as immigrants settle down and change the makeup of your population (imagine if say, Sweden opened its door to a million new immigrants a year today). It takes enormous courage to formulate policies that effectively allow for large changes in the cultural makeup of your electorate and I can&#x27;t think of any other country that does it to the same extent (perhaps Australia, where about a quarter of the population is first or second gen foreign if I recall well; and of course the United States right up to the mid-20th century). So most countries restrict the right of citizen to trade labour with foreign citizen, and freedom of movement across their borders. Singapore doesn&#x27;t, or not much.<p>Then you look at restrictions on consumption. Guns are not banned, they are merely very expensive to own - a permit for a non NS-man involves a $3k/year membership to a gun club. In the United States, real estate is plenty and the police cannot expect to be the first line of defence everywhere, so, particularly in states like Alaska (where a bear might be waiting on your driveway) and the rural states (to the bewilderment of city dwellers in California) guns become an important right to citizen. In Singapore, which is almost 100% high density housing and has an exceptionally efficient police force, this is not an issue. Cars are also expensive to own, to curtail the damage to the commons (roads, and air quality) that comes with high car ownership. A quick trip to Hong Kong (or, for that matter, London) and you rapidly understand why this was implemented.<p>A last, and very important point if we&#x27;re comparing to the United States is the government&#x27;s approach to business competition. Temasek and GIC are big investors in Singtel, yet they allowed and encouraged many competitors to develop; I am most familiar with the team from MyRepublic whose growth has been spectacular and whose founding was determined by the extremely low CAC for telecom in the country. In France, Xavier Niel fought tooth and nail to have the permission to run a telephone network against the existing oligopoly which had many powerful friends in government. In the UK, Virgin was the first company to successfully fight the BA-led legacy airline oligopoly; BA went as far as offering free flights &quot;as a national service&quot; to MPs and it was only Virgin&#x27;s diversification which gave it the reserves and time to beat BA&#x27;s long price war. In the United States, in contrast, lobbying is a huge ticket on most companies&#x27; P&L, and anti-competitive legislation being introduced is almost a standard and accepted way of doing business (e.g. Rick Santorum trying to stop the National Weather Service from making its data public, on behalf of the people who funded his campaign - a textbook anticompetitive move which should be highly illegal and is definitely anti-constitutional).<p>There are a few laws (such as 377A) which (oddly) nobody brought up yet that are a holdover from the British colonial legislature and haven&#x27;t been voted out yet, for cultural reasons. I think it&#x27;s a matter of time, as the nation evolves these things will too.<p>So, under that framework, where is Singapore&#x27;s rights infringement? Which of my arguments do you disagree with?",1433296244

But it seems there is a lot of assumptions on my motivations and personal view on moneys.While i think that those aren&#x27;t strictly necessary to answer the question, i guess i am asking a personal question so it&#x27;s only fair if people some assumptions. So in no particular order , i am sharing my perspective on some the recurring themes :<p>1 - Why do i want money (or why do i want a lot if it :)) :
I am not interested in a luxurious or grandiose life style. For me money is to buy freedom and safety booth for me and the peole i care about. I want myself and them to be able to afford the best of the health care systems, to be able to focus on exactly what we do, etc...etc...<p>2 - How much is &quot;significant wealth&quot; 
10M+<p>3 - Money shouldn&#x27;t  be the focus, the craft is:
I think they both should be. I don&#x27;t think getting wealthy should be though as a direct consequences of great work.
Great work might be correlated or even necessary to building wealth but i don&#x27;t the former always implies the latter. To get wealth i believe i will have to learn how, much in the same wayi had to learn to be a software dev.<p>4 - There is no quick fix. stop looking for it.<p>I am not looking for a quick fix. I am willing to put the hours (hell i am looking forward to it). But i also want to capture and leverage some of the value i will be creating (in  a way that&#x27;s is both legal and ecological)<p>So again a lot of great idea i didn&#x27;t though of and i am already reading on all those venues. The idea i am particular interested is consulting : Is there a demand out there for consulting to startup say 30/week for 6 month for some equity in the company ?<p>Any body in the fanancial market want to share his experience ?<p>Again thanks for all the great answers",1433295870

Trident topologies &quot;compile&quot; down to Core Spout/Bolt topologies (The Trident API has a planner implementation that figures that out -- not unlike an SQL query planner).<p>The Storm Core API provides at-least-once semantics through an acking mechanism described here [1]. The Trident API builds on top of that to support exactly-once semantics by essentially doing a de-dupe [2].<p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly why they don&#x27;t claim to support this, since Trident is build on top of Storm&#x27;s Core API.<p>[1] <a href=""https://storm.apache.org/documentation/Acking-framework-implementation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://storm.apache.org/documentation/Acking-framework-impl...</a>

9650036,comment,9648874,9649729,0,0,shasta,,,"Actually, the connection between non-terminating computations and Russell&#x27;s paradox is fairly strong.  The piece of explanation missing from the article that is that the naive conception of sets corresponds to <i>total</i> boolean valued functions.  That is, a set is a rule that answers whether a value is in the set or not.  To get set theory out of lambdas, you just have to restrict to the subset of lambdas that only apply sets to sets and that end up returning a proposition.<p>So you&#x27;d have to reject a lambda like this: λx. x (x x), because when you rewrite that in set theory notation it looks like this: { x | x ∈ (x ∈ x) }.  Bad since (x ∈ x) is a proposition used as a set.  We&#x27;d also reject λx. x because it returns a set and not a proposition.   Labeling expressions with one of two sorts (proposition or set) can be done statically, though, and this allows us to quickly check whether a lambda corresponds to a construction of naive set theory.  Once you have this correspondence, the rest of the author&#x27;s note goes through fairly well.<p>Except that technically Y = λN. R R, not R R.",1433293846

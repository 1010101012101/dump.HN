It could be described as a kind of Techcrunch as it often covers Startups and new Tech developments, albeit from a personal perspective. Plus it is mostly a one man show, which makes selling it a bit weird. Most expect that somebody could buy it to exploit the page rank. Estimates range from 10000€ to > 100000€ for sales price.<p>Revenue from ads last year was about 37000€, apparently.<p>Also noteworthy maybe that the blog even ranks in the top 100 of most up to date blogs as determined by the CASCADES project: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/blogs/blogs-uc-pa.html<p>Update: according to his blog, it is probably THE most popular german blog:<p>- Technorati: Authority 1.331, 8.520 Blog reactions<p>- Deutsche Blogcharts: No.1.<p>- Rivva Leitmedien-Ranking: No. 3.

There hasn't been a lot of development effort for building anything cross-platform. Out of fifty LISP implementations I looked at, only a few were cross-compatible. Hardly any computer games are multiplatform. I build my own software and release it on Mac, Linux, and Windows whenever possible. It's been really easy starting with a common code base (C/C++/Java/whatever) and creating the GUI using native tools: Xcode, Visual Studio, Glade. The GUIs end up looking good, are easy to make (if a little more trouble to sync between the OSs), and I don't have to spend hours scouring the 'Net for information on GUIs across several operating systems. It's becoming alarmingly common for Google to return no search results about some computing topics and programming errors. If I can't Google it, I can't fix it.<p>One of my biggest problems has been incomplete programming language support. Why should I learn wxWidgets if wxRuby is half-done? The documentation for RubyCocoa is even less substantial. I can't begin coding unless I understand a minimum of how the various GUI objects interact. I finally understand all those dumb underscores in RubyCocoa methods. Objective C is odd, but consistent.<p>Something like a Swing but C based would be nice, but it's a lot of trouble to wrap native methods (menubars, system trays, pop-ups, etc.) and not that rewarding.

423635,comment,422823,422934,0,0,icefox,,,"Funny story on that.  For the Arora browser for a while I was pondering the best way to make a tool to import html bookmarks.  I went a handful of different routes, but none of them were that good (I could import all my test data, but I wasn't sure I could input all users data) because of all the different html bookmark files that people generate, but I had an epiphany.  I had at my fingertips webkit.  So rather then trying to reinvent a bad html parser I just would just let webkit parse it and walk it with javascript.<p>The code ended up being something like<p>QWebView view;
view.load(""file://local/file/foo.html"");
print view.mainFrame()->evaluateJavaScript(javascriptCode);<p>Full source here: <a href=""http://github.com/Arora/arora/tree/master/tools/htmlToXBel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/Arora/arora/tree/master/tools/htmlToXBel</a><p>With QtWebKit working on all platforms and having a really nice api making things like this is a snap and easy to do.",1231348020

We developed it for our own sites and then packaged it up to sell it to others.  We had some teething problems with the earlier versions, but we're still here a number of years later.  It's still a side project (and we have a few of them!!) but it brings in revenues of around $70,000+ a year. There is a team of three people though that worked on this side project and which share on this.<p>We also run:<p>www.europeantenders.com - Around $20,000 a year<p>www.ukscrap.com. This did amazingly well when scrap values were high (we were doing around $2000 a day) but they have become quite low at the moment so its only just covering its costs.<p>Hope the above helps.  Happy to provide more info or help to anyone who wants it",1231347986

423626,comment,423521,423521,0,0,raju,,,"Yes, and No. Saying things out loud doesn't always make you a dick just like not saying them doesn't make them go away.<p>I agree with the author in that there are ways to phrase things, and saying things like ""50% of programmers should find another profession"" may be arrogant, on the other hand, I have come across several programmers (even tech leads and ""architects"") who are really really bad programmers. A lot of these people are in for the pay-check, and the fact that there is very little accountability in a lot of organizations ensures that they will continue to do what they do (badly, if I may add) without no reason or incentive to improve.<p>As long as things ""work"", slap code anywhere with no care of encapsulation. Duplicate code as long as you get to commit code before its time to go home. Methods are 400 lines long, nothing in terms of unit-tests, and when there are unit tests, printlns are the way to test code, because asserts are too advanced (I am _not_ making this up).<p>I am mostly a self-taught programmer, and am always feeling like the finger is pointed at me when I read blogs about those 50%. But guess what, I do what I can do to improve. Write lots of code (outside of work), read blogs and opinions of people who are considered ""heroes"", read open-source, read books about software development, learn new languages, read books on algorithms and data-structures, what-have-you.<p>And I have to sit and deal with the code of people who are writing code that is really really bad (I have dealt with projects where the language used is Java 5, yet no one uses generics, enums, etc because they never looked at the new language features!). Should I be complaining, absolutely? Do I need to be harsh about it, no. Shaming other programmers is not the way to go about it, but honestly, if someone pointed out something stupid that I did (which there are countless instances), I feel humility, but I also feel good in that the person thought I was worthy of a healthy discussion, and open-minded enough to be critiqued while not being insulted. Its a learning experience, and everyone is in it together.<p>Sorry for the long rant.",1231347720

It has additional adjust operations DAS (Decimal Adjust after Addition), AAA, AAS, AAM, AAD (ASCII Adjust after Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division for unpacked values).<p>The 1401 is a decimal machine with one BCD digit per character.

10411014,comment,10401344,10405238,0,0,zaroth,,,"I think it really comes down to the strength of the effect. If the anti-fungal has only a marginal effect on outcome, a large n control group helps tease out statistical significance. If the anti-fungal has a strong readily observable effect, the whole study gets un-blinded and everyone starts getting it pretty quickly anyway.<p>The reality is the control group and the test group are not the exact same people and often it&#x27;s not even completely true everyone is dealing with the &quot;exact same&quot; disease (different genes, different mutations, different past treatment regimens, etc.). I definitely believe there are cases where a control is setup because &quot;that&#x27;s how it must be done&quot; and not because it&#x27;s going to actually provide any useful data at the end of the day to tell you anything about how the test group actually performed.<p>Another way I&#x27;ve seen this done which is a little less wasteful, and when you have high confidence in your new treatment, is to tweak the standard treatment marginally in some way you think might provide some small improvement in both groups, but in a way that could never justify its own full study. Like you modify the dosing schedule, add some vitimin, diet, or exercise change in some way you think will help both groups. But again you can only afford to do that if you are expecting a very strong effect from your new additive treatment which would blow away your tweak statistically, else you risk hiding a small benefit of the new treatment in your tweak.<p>In other words, you give every participant the best damn chance and the best care you can legally give them, and 50% of them know they are on something new which could be a blockbuster, and if it is, the whole group will get early access to it anyway.",1445226767

10411010,comment,10409660,10410166,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"(declare (disclaimer (anecdotes follow)))<p>True. For many people issue lies, I feel, not with changing things, but with knowing what to change and how. Most people - myself included - have pretty streamlined diet: they know what they like, where to buy ingredients for that cheap and how to prepare them. Even starting on a stable, maintainable diet requires you to think through what exactly to change, what new components are needed, where to source them and how to alter your preparation routines. You want to do it in such a way as not to deprive yourself of important nutrients, or else your body will say &quot;fuck it&quot; and force you to break the diet (or if you&#x27;re particularly strong willed, you&#x27;ll feel like crap all the time). If you do this, it&#x27;s easy to keep on diet, but you have to do a big investment up front. I&#x27;ve personally done this once; procrastinated months on it, but after I sit down and made the necessary time investment, my weight reacted to changes pretty much instantly.<p>But I can see how most people simply don&#x27;t have <i>time</i> for diet. It&#x27;s kind of like being poor - you could get a lot more for the same amount of money if you have enough capital available to do bulk purchases. But if you&#x27;re living paycheck-to-paycheck, you don&#x27;t have enough money to buy cheap.<p>Also that&#x27;s why some people are willing to pay for someone else to figure it out for them. I personally know someone struggling with weight for almost two decades, for whom the solution for instant weight loss was to pay someone else to micromanage their food - she got a list of allowed choices and amounts for all meals a given week and - what I think was a key trick - a protein powder alternative to use if she didn&#x27;t like a particular meal. It had pretty much no taste, but it was a line of retreat that let you skip something you don&#x27;t like without breaking the diet.",1445226635

Additionally, the 8086 was a 16-bit processor (the 8088 had an 8-bit bus, but that came later and was still 16-bit internally) so I don&#x27;t think the 8-bit limitation is due to the word size of the CPU in this case. It could be a holdover from the 8080 (8086 isn&#x27;t binary compatible, but it was marketed as &quot;source&quot; compatible so there&#x27;s a fair amount of similarity), but the 68000 (16-bit implementation of a 32-bit ISA) has the same limitation.<p>I think it probably comes down to cost. Just to support two packed digits, you need a fair bit of extra hardware (or a little extra hardware and a bunch of microcode) so you can properly calculate the correction factor. Expanding this to a full word means you need to be able to do that calculation for 4 nibbles instead of 2 which is about 3 times worse (you effectively get the most significant nibble &quot;for free&quot; so it&#x27;s 3 extra nibbles to support instead of just 1).",1445224544

Each &quot;process&quot; running under CP was a virtual machine whose operating system API was mostly just the IBM/370 instruction set (i.e., no abstraction above the hardware architecture).

You could actually run a different guest operating system (i.e., a different set of OS abstractions at user level) on each virtual machine.<p>The authors of this paper do mention VM/370 in their &quot;Related Work&quot; section (page 5).

I was looking for a lyrics web service some time ago for the following idea: certain times when listening to a song it would be useful/more entertaining if the lyrics would follow along with the song similar to karaoke, this could be done by running the song through some speech recognition software such as nuance to get the approximate words/time during the song. You would then tie that into the lyrics through the web service and would be able to display the lyrics along with the song for almost any song.

The feedback from non-testers might be a little more useful, but it's still a little suspect considering it's from people who are confident more testing would improve their software yet still don't do it. Furthermore, unit tests are only as good as the test cases themselves and a survey can't account for quality of tests.

We're still pretty much a two man shop, though we've just hired a part-time support and documentation person (five hours per week--extremely part-time, but enough to free me and Jamie up a bit from support roles so we can focus on other revenue-generating tasks).<p>I may have gone in an abnormal direction by hiring someone really experienced for the support role, rather than hiring someone really cheap and training them.  He costs more, but we don't have to train him and I've got great confidence in the support he provides.  He's a technology jack of all trades that happens to fit our business very well, and I believe he'll provide far more value to our customers than he costs us to keep him working.<p>We're torn on the ""stay small"" vs. ""go big"" question, as well.  We know we're going after huge revenues...we're just trying to figure out how to maximize those opportunities without bogging down the company with a lot of unnecessary head count.  I think the key is to boil it down to your core business.  Our thinking is: ""Why do people pay us?""  And the answers are: Powerful software that gets better all the time, great personal support via our website, less painful licensing processes than our competitors.<p>So, those are the things we need to spend money on (plus marketing and advertising in order to let people know those are the things we provide).  Everything else is not our job--we'll outsource it.  In the next week or two I'm planning to hire a part-time bookkeeper to come in once per week to clean out my inbox, pay bills, and enter our accounting data into the accounting system, etc.<p>But, then again, that still doesn't answer your question, and doesn't solve the problem--at some point, if you have success, you have to hire more people.  Full time legal, accounting, sales, support, etc.  It just happens...but I do think it's worth fighting a few aspects of that.  Hierarchy can be a problem, and should be fought against pretty strongly...I've seen an organization that brought in a new CEO, and she looked around at the general messiness and inefficiency of the organization (a ~60 person non-profit with a few tens of millions in managed money), and decided that what the company needed was more C-levels.  Last I heard they had seven C-levels.  That's less than ten employees per C-level, for those keeping count at home.  I'm pretty confident this did not improve the efficiency of the organization.<p>I get the distinct impression from people I know who work at Google that they have a similar problem.  MBAs look at the organization and think, ""What this company needs is a little more management.""  And they hire more MBA-wielding managers, who look around the organization and think, ""What this company needs is a little more management.""

Checking for errors after every function call is way too much work</i><p>Think of what the exception code ends up as in ASM.  Basically <i>try</i> transparently wraps system calls with the same type of error handling code as his example.  However, if you want to write stable code you need to account for each of these errors anyway.  So when your DB connection fails you need to know if it’s a TCP/IP error or a Bad Password etc which means either wrapping each line with its own try catch or decoding the exception within a catch block.  Granted, exception handling let’s your write code for the ideal case and avoid crashing when something messes up but as soon as you want to recover from an error without starting over you end up writing the same code anyway.

It's also very possible that we could easily get squashed in a very short time.

When's the last time that worked out? There'll be a lot of managarial communication, overhead, bureaucracy, stupidity, etc. Assuming they really are doing this together: having worked at large corporations and knowing how inefficient even internal management is, I actually wouldn't worry too much about this.",1214942570

year ago. The first few weeks were hard, the next few were
interesting, and the rest was just fun.<p>I suppose it's because I've always been a tinkerer and I love the fact
that the wall between editing with emacs and editing emacs is so
small.<p>Anyways, this is all old news. Everybody already knows the arguments
for both sides and they're both true. I still use vim when the job
fits (configs or quick edits) and I use largely emacs for my
development (even if though I work at a vim shop and everybody gives
me dirty looks).",1214942445

Then, you go to a processor to settle the transaction given a specific transaction ID for which you have received an authorization.<p>There's a very important distinction: A gateway doesn't involve transferring money, while a processor does. There's a huge set of risks on the processor side, and being a ""start-up"" processor seems to be a non-starter (big banks usually perform this task).<p>You also need to figure out what you have to lose to fraud. Gateways, it would seem, don't have that much to lose to fraud (they just handle the transaction, they don't settle it or transfer any kind of money).<p>There's definitely a huge market for a better gateway (Authorize.net's APIs suck). Being a new PayPal, in my opinion, is going to be incredibly difficult, for many of the reasons mentioned in this thread.<p>I'd start your journey by educating yourself on exactly how the credit card system works.

Getting them caught up with your groups lingo/stories/norms is akin to teaching a kid.  Exerting that much effort into a 'new friend' is difficult for me to justify - especially when the only thing tying you to the new person is a whim or chance encounter.  Making friends is great, it works well with all aspects of social life and breaks routines, but there's definitely real reasons why it isn't done at the same pace as one sees in college.<p>When a typical jane doe moves into anomie (IE right after highschool, moving to a new place, new job) they're left to redefine themselves through the people they interact with.  It's human nature to go seek new people and make new friends. In contrast - if one is rooted and knows what they like/who their friends are/the basic character makeup that they are attracted too, one has much less ""drive"" for us to get out and converse with new people.

But with gas prices only rising by November hopefully people will see that HSR is a very viable way of transportation.<p>I have been to the Accela express  in the east coast  (Boston to NYC),  and while they use older TGV models, their speed is maxed at 120mph, with average speed being about 75-80mph, due to urban restrictions on the route.  Unfortunately it is not much faster than taking a bus.
If that train was going at 200+mph, it would have been hugely popular.<p>Addition:  With the pain that flying has become,  from control checkpoints, lines, to now getting charged for even the first baggage,  HSR travel becomes even more attractive.
Plus travel with train in California will be very scenic.

Some of them may be helpful to folks though; there's a bunch on quitting the day job from July 07 and a lot of Pylons/Django comparisons in Dec 07.<p>I'm going on vacation in about 10 minutes, so I'm not going to see the rest of the discussion.  If folks find other articles on the blog interesting, feel free to submit them; I have more than enough karma already.",1214247721

Say you as a founder are a Ruby guy, perhaps you value being able to rapid prototype, throw away code, iterate quickly.<p>Maybe your product needs to be very high performance so you hire a team of C programmers. What you might find is that their idea of iterating quickly is on a different timescale than yours, due to the low-level and unforgiving nature of C perhaps your team tends to be pedantic (by your standards) or correctness/detail oriented (by theirs).<p>In this situation <i>your team</i>, influenced by <i>your technology</i> choice, is bringing a different value set than your own to the table. BUT this is not (necessarily) a bad thing, if C really is be best tech for your product your team can strive merge both your and their values; however, my point is without you actively trying to do that, your tech just defined the value set, not <i>you</i>.

5612882,comment,5609546,5609546,18,0,jgrahamc,,,"There's no science here. This so-called experiment is worthless IMHO.<p>Feeding people all-liquid diets to keep them alive is well known. That's what happens to coma patients and lots of work in creating enteral nutrition products has been done. Given that people's lives depend on this that's a good place to start (take a look at, for example, Jevity [3]). And the people who make that stuff worry about keeping your gastrointestinal system working, the right balance of everything needed to keep a (in this case, sick) person alive, how to keep the product from spoiling, etc.<p>So, he's not creating something new.<p>The other argument against the existing products is price. Here's a quick comparison. He claims that it costs him $155 per month [1]. If he were to live on Jevity 1.5 he'd need to drink 4.2 cans per day at a cost of $57/24 per can (it's sold in packs of 24 cans [2]) or $9.98 per day which is roughly $300 a month. (If he ups the kcal to 2,000 a day from the 1,500 he was on then he'd need to drink 5.6 cans a day which is $400 a month).<p>So, he'd be spending 2 to 2.5 times what he currently is. But he'd be spending it on a product that's been quality controlled and tested.<p>Is there any indication that he can fundamentally change the economics of this type of food? I don't think so. Especially when you factor in all the work that the makers of Jevity etc. are doing at that price point (the QA, the distribution, the packaging).<p>And certainly not enough to meet all his other goals about solving world hunger.<p>If a market for soylent emerges then I'd imagine that companies that make things like Jevity would step in. Oh wait, they already do. There's Ensure etc.<p>Also, there's so much other crap in his blog posts about how soylent lasts forever [4], how no one need muscles anyway [5], how even stopping eating soylent for a week led to massive cognitive problems [5], that it's hard to take the whole thing seriously.<p>And then there's this [1]: ""I for one would not miss the stereotype of the housewife in the kitchen. Providing diverse, palatable, and nutritious meals for an entire family every day must be exhausting. What if taking a night off didn't mean unhealthy pizza or expensive take out? How wasteful society has been with its women! The endless hours spent cooking and cleaning in the kitchen could be replaced with socializing, study, or creative endeavors.""<p>Ah yes, soylent is not only going to solve world hunger, make us more healthy, save time, make us more creative, save money: it's going to emancipate women!<p>But there's more [5]: ""We no longer live in a hunter-gatherer society. I have no use for bulging biceps. No one in the United States plows fields or hammers steel. It has all been automated. We need mental strength. We need creativity, patience, discipline, and humility. If people had more self-control obesity would take care of itself. Perhaps companies would be more productive if managers had more humility and employees had more discipline.""<p>Yes, soylent will result in an increase in humility and all those fat people who lack self-discipline will be thin.<p>Hooray.<p>[1] <a href=""http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.abbottstore.com/jevity+reg/jevity-15-cal-8-oz-can-case-of-24/invt/57333/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abbottstore.com/jevity+reg/jevity-15-cal-8-oz-can...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://abbottnutrition.com/brands/products/jevity-1_5-cal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abbottnutrition.com/brands/products/jevity-1_5-cal</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.soylent.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soylent.me</a> claims it 'lasts for years'<p>[5] <a href=""http://robrhinehart.com/?p=570"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robrhinehart.com/?p=570</a>",1366984387

But by comparing the installs before and after we ran the admob campaign we can at least tell if it had any impact. Here are the numbers for the Danish market:<p>Monday April 1:\nDownloads: 906\nClicks: 0<p>Tuesday April 2:\nDownloads: 577\nClicks: 0<p>Wednesday April 3:\nDownloads: 358\nClicks: 0<p>-- CAMPAIGN BEGAN --\nThursday April 4:\nDownloads: 336\nClicks: 1591<p>Friday April 5:\nDownloads: 264\nClicks: 1836<p>Saturday April 6:\nDownloads: 275\nClicks: 2410<p>Sunday April 7:\nDownloads: 227\nClicks: 2050<p>-- CAMPAIGN ENDED --<p>Monday April 8:\nDownloads: 105\nClicks: 0<p>Tuesday April 9:\nDownloads: 107\nClicks: 0<p>CONCLUSION:\nSo, we bought almost 8 000 clicks.

Total installs was less than the day before when we bought zero, null, niente clicks (!).<p>I know - and totally understands - AdMob is worthless for paid apps. But I had expected more for a free app which had reached the top lists and received good reviews. \nFor us AdMob campaigns are a bad marketing investment. The installs will cost more than we earn. \nWhat's your experience from AdMob for a free app with in-app purchases?",1366984306

I'm not saying the mechanisms underlying a transistor are simple. I've taken (and struggled with) a microelectronics course. I have a good idea how complex they are.<p>I'm saying that the metrics for success are really simple because we have designed it to fit a very simple logical abstraction. If you want to make a better transistor, the process might be extremely complicated, but it couldn't be simpler to test what you have and see if it's correct.<p>On the other hand, it's simple to make food (I should, however, stop and point out that when Rhinehart is ""making food"", mostly what he's doing is mixing together other existing foods. Of course <i>that</i> is simple.) But it's orders of magnitude more complex to analyze the result of that food than doing the same for a transistor. Because now instead of plugging a black box we understand into another black box that we understand, you're plugging your invention into the human digestive system.

If you're there YMMV but this was clearly my experience in my BU.)<p>During the review cycle, you were given, more or less, two ratings.

I did well at it (not just my opinion, but that of others and consistent performance reviews).

Most of the taxi systems in Uber's homeland are highly regulated and effectively run by strong lobbying organizations who are very vocal about their concerns and distaste for having their business threatened. In the US, such allegations are not only reasonable, but they're not even really a sign of corruption - typically, the people who get their way are the people who ask the loudest and most frequently, and that doesn't mean that anyone is acting in an unsavory manner.<p>This isn't to say that there isn't a twinge of tinfoil hattery going on, or to say that the same tactic is appropriate here, but the fact is that they've had tremendous success asking their users to tell the authorities that they're good guys in the past - they had success in this endeavor here, for that matter. The fact that there is a blog post calling them out doesn't really seem to have had a strong impact on the support that their users are giving them.<p>Moreover, this blog post smacks of tinfoil hattery - is the suggestion that, by not signaling itself as a taxi, Uber is attempting to confuse users? To my knowledge, they're not picking people up on the street - only people who have signed up for an account and are well aware of the price differences.  It seems likely that they're less interested in removing the need for the meter and more interested in removing the need for external signals that the car is fared similarly to a taxi - which is, after all, 50% of what they're offering. So a yellow license plate, sign, and fare sticker might have the larger impact in their eyes.<p>Based on that, do you not think that it's reasonable that, in an, ""unregulated,"" market, they should be allowed to charge people who have jumped through the hoops to actually get into an Uber car, with all of the fare information shoved in their faces a number of times, however they have agreed upon with their customers?<p>I'm playing devil's advocate here, but let's please be intellectually honest.",1366983504

It is essentially impossible to control every variable that might influence reported crime rates, so the mere fact that there may be fewer reported taxi-related crimes after regulation increased than before would be an unconvincing argument.<p>This is really an epistemological argument.

With a drug which if you took 40x the daily dose you might die, or a drug that might cause significant harmful side effects at normal dose, you need careful studies to prove a benefit and quantify risks.  With a dietary change, the risks are orders of magnitude lower. I'd be surprised if the average American wouldn't improve their nutritional status doing this for a while, with an existing diet likely low in magnesium, copper, zinc, vitamin c and d and probably more.",1366981716

He said that a fellow salesman shocked the office by coming to work in a blue rather than white shirt. (He didn't mention any deaths from the shock, so I assume the guy still had suit and tie.) And Gerald Weinberg has written of a slightly earlier period that at IBM you demonstrated that you were a genius by growing a beard and not getting fired.<p>I did once work for a place where men where expected to wear ties when going to customer sites. (You might also have squeeze in behind a refrigerator-sized minicomputers.) My boss grumbled a bit when one of our better techs skipped the tie on the grounds of limited range of motion, having recently had shoulder surgery. But there were no consequences.<p>Oh, and from the truly distant past: I worked with a man whose father-in-law had worked at FBI headquarters. The older man told of J. Edgar Hoover one day stopping in the hall, looking over at an agent in an unusually-colored suit (I think green) and say ""That's an odd-colored suit for an agent to wear.)

By making the bottom of the market illegal (by making it uneconomical), you haven't stopped these crimes from happening, you've simply forced them to occur in the black market where there is even less of a chance to prevent them.<p>Again, the analogy with drug prohibition is clear. There is an incredible amount of violence occurring, but that isn't a justification for continuing its illegality. To the contrary, its illegal nature is the primary reason the violence occurs, because there is no way to settle disputes in the court system.<p>Similarly, someone operating a black market taxi cannot call the police when someone refuses to pay. Instead, they must resort to threatening (and engaging in) violence to get payment. The customers may engage in violence against these underground drivers for the same reason. Making it illegal serves nobody, and only increases danger for all parties.",1366981394

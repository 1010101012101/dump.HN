1783370,comment,1782565,1783272,0,0,cdavid,,,"I should have explained what I mean by trivial: I think any competent programmer knows the value of testing. So in that sense saying that you should write tests is like saying you should write good code - it is true, but not very insightful.<p>In a time constraint environment, you often need to make a choice between more tests and more features, etc... I have seen a lot of people who said their code was great because it was well tested, but then the tests depend so much on the implementation that it actually goes against better code (since refactoring may mean breaking a lot of unit tests). So the more interesting question is: what to test, how, and how far. For example, my own rule for testing is that in general, I don't test something if testing it takes more code than the feature itself (except for regression testing, and things which really play well with testing, like parsers and the likes, and code which needs to run on many different platforms).<p>It is also useful to recognize when testing has value, and to avoid overestimating its actual benefits. Too often, people don't really think about failures when testing, or how the API it exercices can be used in a straightforward manner or not. For example, I don't get so much the value of TDD - I find it much more useful to think in terms of API usecases, for which small tests are often not well suited. Sure, designing for easy testing can help, but you can get the same benefit without TDD in my opinion.<p>Finally, too often, I see ""this library is well tested"" sold as a feature in open source projects - but test coverage is not a feature. Sure, everything else being equal, I would prefer a well tested library to a not well tested library. But everything else is not equal: there is a constant tradeoff between designing better API, getting a better documentation or installation process and testing.",1286891890

D1 and D2 are like different languages. D1 went to a dead end and D2 got nowhere, it got into a conundrum feedback loop. It's a bit hard to explain everything in this post since there is a lot to cover, but most of the community that is years into this is aware of all of it.<p>Also, good luck with any kind of support that is not in the interest/hobby of D developer. I once wrote a fairly large program that was for a commercial purpose (wrote as an order) - and I got stuck on a fairly large bug in standard library which I couldn't resolve myself because I have lacked the expertise to do so, I even think it was not open sourced then also (basically free() never returned memory to the OS). That bug is still open after several years. I offered money, anything basically to get this resolved since my application crashed due to it - if there weren't for helpful Tango guys I would have to rewrite the damn thing from scratch in another language.<p>D1/Tango had so much potential, but it got nowhere, unfortunately. I am still bitter I spent so much time and effort in D at all, just to return to C (and some C++).",1286891808

Presumably this is not how jobs work.  You need someone to go around harvesting individual opportunities.  Like collecting truffles as opposed to growing potatos.<p>With other unique items such as houses / ebay on the demand side you have various market entry costs: can the 'buyer' physically come over and see the house / can you get their paypal details?  With jobs it's very easy (cheap) to apply, while for the employer it is costly to assess applications - making the pre-screening service offered by recruiters attractive.<p>Plus to disintermediate you'd need employers to directly deal with more of the HR process.  That's open to them already, I suspect it's just not something people relish.  Like you could save money washing your car but often it's just seen as a pain to be avoided.<p>Perhaps there are other improvements besides disintermediation: e.g. jobs sites with recruiter reputation/feedback.  Seems pretty obvious but I actually haven't seen it around much.  Can imagine there would be some bias (everyone who didn't get a post is peeved, plus some that did).",1286891147

If C# hadn't played the Firefox to Java's IE, I'm not convinced that many of Java's linguistic advances would have ever seen the light of day.<p>Perhaps the single greatest contribution of Java has been limiting the impact of poorly-written Visual Basic applications on the business software landscape, though the alternative it provides is poorly-written Java applications, which in addition to being slow, unmaintainable spaghetti code look visually distinct enough from each platform's native widget set to be jarring.<p>I have little experience with mobile development so perhaps this is a monumentally bad idea, but a set of well-defined APIs, a clean windowing and widget layer with its own APIs, and native bindings for a handful of the more popular languages (Python, Ruby, C++) plus perhaps one or two more specialized languages the platform developers want to support (Clojure/Scheme/CL, Go) would provide enough flexibility to let developers do what they want.<p>(Although come to think about it this seems to be the approach that Maemo used, and that platform never saw the uptake I thought it deserved.

Actually this sort of thinking is probably because of the ""dangerous plugs"" pictures we are always shown as children. A stuffed up socket just looks automatically dangerous to us.<p>I guess you're coming from the perspective of overloading the socket. This is surprisingly hard to do - but you can do it equally well across multiple sockets (basically, if your fuse breaker is going to let it burn it doesn't care much where the devices are plugged in :)) so it is something of a misconception to consider a crowded socket particularly dangerous. People happily use an 8 gang extension cable without batting an eyelid.<p>More importantly having fuses in the plugs is unlikely to help all that much, the crucial fuse is the one in your circuit breaker. The current will divide across the sockets (my circuit theory is rusty so I won't try any figures :)) and it is the socket taking the brunt. While you would likely eventually see a spike that trips one of the plugs I'm betting the socket catching fire is more likely.<p>And, finally, I suspect these would be rated (well, if they weren't vapour-ware) for devices with internal fusing or low power draws. I'd also suspect that the plug ""holder"" would be fused.<p>BTW it is somewhat moot anyway because I believe those red tabs are a fuse holder :)",1286890674

(My state, Minnesota, has easy online payments, so there's no paperwork required.)<p>Between March 1 and April 15: Do your taxes. Use TurboTax; it will simplify your life.  Take appropriate deductions for everything that TurboTax asks, but make sure to have documentation.<p>April 15: Repeat what you did on January 15, but for income received between January 1 and March 31.<p>June 15: Repeat January's step again, but for income from between April 1 and May 31.<p>September 15: Repeat January again, but for income from between June 1 and August 31.<p>Note that you only really need to make estimated payments if you expect to owe more than $1,000 on tax day if you were to not make estimated payments.

1783185,comment,1782337,1782722,0,0,ciniglio,,,"I actually think that text has a fairly high information density rate compared to iconography. The perfect example of this is the command line. Power users tend to prefer a terminal because it is more concise than clicking around in a gui. I think that the problem lies in the fact that we have very few universal icons, especially for something like a phone interface. This means that while an icon for 'unread mail' would be smaller than the text describing it, no one would know what it meant without a description. Since there is no real limit to the actions we want our phones or computers to perform, text seems to be the way to go. Of course, some actions (e.g. save, cut, paste) have icons that have been in use for so long that it might be fair to call them universal. You can see an example of what I mean in most mac os x applications, where the buttons generally have icons with labels.<p>Disclaimer: I work for microsoft, but nowhere related to the phone team.<p>Edit: My point is more about interfaces than design. I know nothing about typography.",1286888904

The one thing that I genuinely hate about it is the menu button. So many great features in so many great apps go undiscovered because the user is expected to have the idea to press the menu button in the right activity. And even when you have discovered the feature, pressing the menu button is just that bit of cognitive overhead which subtracts from a delightful experience. The most powerful features that Android's architecture(intents, etc) enables are stuck behind hidden menus. I would guess that most users use their phones just like an iPhone- with the exception of widgets on homescreens.

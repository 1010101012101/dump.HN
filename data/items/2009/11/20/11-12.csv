952262,comment,950751,952109,0,0,rbanffy,,,"""you can install Windows on any hardware you want as long as it's compatible""<p>Sorry, I had to laugh.<p>Part of the blame for Itanium losing the 64-bit bandwagon could be pointed to Microsoft, for not having Windows ready for it when it became available. Or for delaying the launch - it's silly to launch a processor without an OS to run it on.<p>Having Windows support for your hardware is paramount to any desktop computer company since the early 90's (with the notable exception of Apple). Alpha, MIPS and PowerPC (as in PReP) desktop systems are not dead because x86 systems were a better price/performance choice: they are dead because Microsoft pulled the plug on NT for them (and Linux was not ready to take its place at that time). That's also why all our computers are remarkably alike from the inside. It's not that Microsoft is open - it's that they have computer makers cornered.<p>Today I can get a non x86 computer and expect all my userland to work (with the possible exception of Flash, Skype and parts of Eclipse). I could not do that in the 90s.<p>The Itanium is not an expensive server chip because Intel cannot build an Atom-like processor with the Itanium ISA (heck - it must be easier than do it with the x86 ISA). It's an expensive server chip because it won't run Windows 7 and Office.<p>I see very little competition in the development tools in the Microsoft space these days. Tool makers know better - if they make something that competes with Visual Studio, Microsoft will come after them in the next release cycle and it is not worth the pain to fight them. That's why every non-Microsoft development tool around is built for a niche. Or is free, a case where Microsoft will not be able to go after you. That could be a reason for the free language explosion we are seeing.<p>And thanks. The Psystar imbroglio is a statement of how evil Apple can be about competition these days.<p>It even seems that after stopping attracting the best and brightest, they started attracting former Microsoft minions...",1258717340

952254,comment,951777,952187,0,0,kurtosis,,,"Hey nice comment! I was thinking something similar.I believe that it should be possible to effectively use both mechanistic and teleological language.  In mechanics you have newtonian (mechanistic) and lagrangian (teleological) approaches.  I often wonder how well determined the shapes and forms of animals are by evolutionary dynamics.  I would think that evolution is very sensitive to small accidents and fluctuations in populations, i.e. you could rewind the clock and run evolution forward many times and get many different answers.  Against this view are all those examples of convergent evolution.<p>Another reason that people may react harshly when you use teleological language is that biology (unlike physics) is constantly under attack by people with all sorts of crazy theories about a supernatural designer - (talk about a teleology!)  so I can understand why such language would be somewhat taboo.",1258716900

That means parents often don't know what to do, or how to help.<p>Further, lessons and homework are often not intended to be done by creative people without instruction.  Creative people find unexpected ways to follow instructions the teachers (or lesson planners) thought were clear, obvious and unambiguous.<p>I see a lot of criticisms of lessons and homework like this, but I've also seen the frustration from teachers trying to create lessons that are EXCITING and ENGAGING and ENTERTAINING and THRILLING and WONDERFUL, because now they're not expected just to be good at teaching and experts in their subjects, but also entertainers.<p>This lesson/homework isn't perfect, but I think many of the criticisms aimed at it are misplaced and ignoring the context.

The instructions are ambiguous. How are you supposed to fill them in? What is the connection between the 8 in the first example and 8 counters? Are they the same by accident? Why should both results be the same (8+3 and 10+X) - I thought about adding 10 new counters, so that's 8+3=11, 10+8=18, 8+10=18 (although it doesn't make much sense either).

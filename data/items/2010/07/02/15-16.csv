My wife (masters in a science from a top N university) has a significant failure rate on battery changing. Not having to worry about it would be better.<p>Maybe we could liken it to polarized plugs (for those of us in 110v AC land). We could have labeled plugs with + and -, and then told people to match them to the outlet when they plugged in a device, but over all, redesigning the equipment was more likely to work.",1278086335

1481441,comment,1480835,1480835,0,0,joshkaufman,,,"Here's a re-framing of ""free will"" that I find very useful - it's more like ""free won't."" The technical term is Inhibition. Our physical and mental processes may make us <i>inclined</i> to act in a certain way, but we have a limited ability to inhibit that initial response long enough to do something different by using willpower.<p>Think of a lion in the brush, ready to pounce on an unsuspecting antelope. The lion <i>wants</i> to pounce, but inhibits the response for a little while, waiting for the antelope to come a little closer.<p>Since willpower is depleted with use (a process called Ego Depletion), inhibition is a very limited power - it's difficult, requires a lot of energy, and can't be maintained indefinitely. Our natural inclinations and environment are extremely powerful forces, and we can't hold out for long.<p>That's why, if you're experiencing some form of temptation (wanting to do what you know you shouldn't), it's better to inhibit and remove yourself from the situation as quickly as possible vs. rely on your ""free will"" to save you. Otherwise, you'll progressively find it more and more difficult to resist until you act.<p>I find this definition very useful because it maintains human agency (the ability to choose your behavior), while respecting the undeniable power that environment and circumstances have on our behavior.",1278086268

1481436,comment,1479687,1479687,0,0,vessenes,,,"I'm very interested in extrapolating some of these trends out -- America does not have a social system which allows society as a whole to benefit from GDP growth while jobs are destroyed.<p>My social history tells me that no other countries have been successful at creating such a system either.<p>Whether or not we have such a system, we may well be moving to a world in which the US can continue to increase GDP significantly while unemployment increases (efficiency increases, in other words). Successfully creating a Chinese middle class, and selling them our branded stuff only hastens that eventuality.<p>What happens to all these American unemployed people? In an ideal world, they would be artists and poets, inventors and writers, people who add to our cultural capital. The end-game here would (in my dreams) look a lot like Ian Banks' Culture books -- a utopian society which has moved past 'the age of scarcity'. Unfortunately, right now, places like Saudi are the closest we can look to for a society with, frankly, enough money for everyone.<p>In the interim, we are facing a sort of cultural crisis. America's PDI (Power Distance Index) is middling right now; the PDI describes out comfort with and exposure to, high levels of power differences in society, including wealth. Saudi has one of the highest PDIs in the world, meaning that they as a country haven't solved this problem of building an equitable society based on passive income production; in fact, their society is less equitable than many poorer countries. It is hard to imagine that we are aiming at anything else but a Saudi-ish social system if the GDP growth + unemployment growth trend continues.<p>I say this partly because Americans think of someone who is 'unemployed' as lazy, uneducated, etc. In fact, there's a significant undercurrent of that perspective in this thread. The reality is that if we are able to keep improving productivity while birth rates decline, there will eventually be less work. There might be more money, but there will be less work.<p>How do we deal with that? I don't have a good answer, but I still am part of the problem -- I would much rather spend capital on an automated solution for my business than hire someone.",1278086174

1481430,comment,1476723,1476723,0,0,wake_up_sticky,,,"Obviously I worded some things wrong in my original submission. I realize that offering a (much) higher salary won't necessarily (or even probably) prevent a ""horde of unqualified candidates"" from applying. What I meant was that if a hiring manager places an ad which fails to attract an adequate number of qualified candidates--the ratio between qualified and unqualified candidates being of secondary importance--he would have to be incompetent not to offer a better salary the next time around.<p>Also, the main point of the submission wasn't that programmers ought to be paid more. It was that I find it offensive when people claim that there are no good programmers out there but don't even seem to consider offering higher salaries. I'm reminded of the woman who is asked out five times a week by reasonably good-looking men of average social status, rejects them all out of hand, and then laments, ""There are no men out there!""<p>Actually, this is worse.

I've seen lots of examples of 5 line LISP code that does something totally amazing but you don't really know what it means but it's so abstract.  If you have a quick job to do, I don't see that it's a limitation in using a language that requires to build the most straight forward solution.<p>PHP is ugly, but for the most part it isn't horrible -- these days you can easily avoid some of the worst parts and concentrate on making code that would be very equivalent to the same code in, say, Java.  PHP is very straight forward -- it means what it says.<p>""Your web framework in PHP probably isn't continuation-based, it probably doesn't compile your s-expression HTML tree into assembler code before rendering it.""<p>This just sounds like over-engineering the problem.",1278085986

Asking how long it will take to implement those features is a bit off; instead, you should be asking ""What needs to happen to implement these features and what would you estimate all of it to be?""<p>Just a search feature and social networking/profile feature implies a whole gamut of underlying logic that you aren't aware of (because you aren't a developer). Depending on what your vision is, those two features alone could end up being a two month long project just for a first iteration (don't forget about iterations!)<p>I charge about $65 per hour for web application programming work in either Python or PHP (I prefer Python), I segment my time into 40 hour work weeks. For two months of work that would equal out to a little over twenty grand for a <i>first iteration</i>.

This sounds like the kind of design by committee that happens elsewhere. Not naming names, because it happens all over the place.<p>It's as if someone in engineering stood up and said:<p>""Hey, we knew our 'bar' algorithm was shit when we implemented it, and we in engineering said something about it, but no one listened. So fuck those guys in marketing, we need to implement a realistic algorithm, pronto.""<p>Then the marketing team responds:<p>""Well, it might be good engineering, but users certainly aren't going to get the warm and fuzzies. Isn't there something else we can do?""<p>UX reluctantly speaks up:<p>""Well, we could make bars 1-3 <i>taller</i>, so they appear more like the old 4-5 bars.""<p>Marketing and UX: <HIGH FIVE><p>Engineering: <cries in a corner>",1278083129

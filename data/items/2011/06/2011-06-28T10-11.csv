2704850,comment,2702384,2704253,2,0,demallien,,,"In the history of medicine, we have seen the following development:<p>1) We first learned how to deal with purely physical trauma types of problem - bandaging, splinting etc.<p>2) we then learned how to do pain relief (opium, aspirine)<p>3) we then learned how to deal with external microbes (antibiotics)<p>4) we are just starting to learn how to deal with viruses, which requires understanding their DNA. I would not be surprised to see viruses under control in the next 10 years or so, as gene sequencing / analysis gets better.<p>Now the thing about 3 and 4 is that they're relatively independant of the genotype/phenotype of the person being treated. You can take the same medication and apply it to anyone suffering those types of disease, and it will work.<p>What's remaining is the admittedly large class of diseases that are mostly caused by a person's own genotype/phenotype.  Here we're talking about heart disease, immune system diseases, cancer.  It is not likely that we will be able to find a one-size-fits-all solution to these diseases, which means that we won't be able to knock them over until we gain the capacity to manufacture a medication for an individual.<p>Still, with the ever-increasing CPU capability that we have at the moment, it doesn't seem inconceivable that these types of drugs will be available in 40 years or so, at which point it starts to become interesting to try and figure out just how we <i>are</i> going to die. At that point we will presumably have the necessary control over cell reproduction to allow the regeneration of tissue etc.  For example, at the moment we think aging is linked to the loss of telomeres.  Imagine taking a single heart muscle cell, and replacing all of the lost telomeres through genetic manipulation, and then re-inserting the heart cell into a patient.  If aging theory is correct, this one cell will eventually (on the timeframe of decades) come to to dominate the number of cells in the heart, as non-modified cell lines will die out due to the loss of telomeres during reproduction.  No more heart attacks.<p>Now, I've just plucked that 40 year figure out of the air, it might be 100 years, or 200 years, which of course would probably be too late for most of us.  But the thing is that it is useless to compare the rate of medical advances of the past with what we're expecting to see in the future.  Future development is going to be based on a very fine-grained understanding of life processes, whereas that has just not been possible up until very recently.",1309257595

I did not mean to imply that photography was not a technical or creative field, rather by ""mechanical process"", I meant the physical act of creation.<p>I put a brush to canvas, or a pencil to paper. 
My gestures are effected by micro muscle movements,
the interplay between the grain of the canvas and the camelhair in my brush, the way I <i>personally</i> perceive my subject. No two lines drawn by my hand, no two drops of ink flecked from my pen will ever be the same. My emotional state at the time will felt in my brush strokes.<p>All your points I agree with, but ultimately photography (by its process) has less potential for a physically variable and personal experience (for example the connectedness that a sculptor feels with the work physically formed by their hands) <i>specifically</i> in the dimension that I am talking about.<p>Also, your points on composition (perspective, framing,focus,exposure) are present in other visual mediums (although focus and exposure aren't generally terms that I hear a lot of painters use, it's still there), and arguably more under your creative control.<p>Finally, with photography you are limited to that which exists already in this world (once you start getting heavily into post-processing, it's hard to call keep calling it ""photography"").",1309255609

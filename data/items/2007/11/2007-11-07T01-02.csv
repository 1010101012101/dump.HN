Sure I _might_ be interested in whether Sue had the hives last Friday night or not, but hearing about the coolest sports drink from the chick I met two years ago in a bar?

It's a social achievement because it appears to be working.",1194400283

Just more evidence that Facebook really gets ""people"", while the only thing Google seems to understand is ""data"", to their detriment. <p>When Facebook announced their platform, they talked about social graphs, distribution, and virality. Google talked about ""openness"" and ""platforms"". They still just don't get it.",1194399588

So to make a straw man argument, I have to distort something you've said so that it becomes easier to refute.  Feel free to explain how I can do this when your post is reproduced verbatim above mine.<p>You meant <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> (advanced by a loaded question, even!).  Technically, it's not relevant to startups' degree of ease whether you've been successful as a founder or not, but it is valid for me to ask you to cite your evidence.<p>You claim to be an expert on startups based on evidence you can't reveal.  That's a circular appeal to authority (yourself) established by an appeal to a higher power (all your friends' top-secret successes).<p>I don't want to be (too much of) a pompous ass here, but I get jumpy when people try to convince me of things that are both improbable and highly desirable.",1194399573

No, says co-founder Matt Maroon, who points to the fantasy sports exemption in the ""Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act"". The act, which was a big blow to sites like PartyPoker, specifically exempts ""participation in any fantasy or simulation sports game or educational game or contest"". Fantasy sports is seen as a game of skill and played for a fixed cash prize. Although a quick perusal of the exemption leaves you feeling they're at least bending the rules.""",1194398847

Fortunately current reseach in psychology seems to suggest that this can actually be learned. Here are a couple guides for anyone interested:<p><pre><code> Learned Optimism by Martin Seligman

 The Resilience Factor by Karen Revich and Andrew Shatte

 Mindset by Carolyn Dweck

I would even go so far as to suggest that this kind of material, and perhaps even some training, be incorporated into the Y-combinator program. Perhaps even a study could be conducted? ",1194397331

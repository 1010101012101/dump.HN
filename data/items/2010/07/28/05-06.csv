Do stuff you normally don't do!  Get out of your comfort zone!  Don't worry about anything else but what you want to do.  Set a tough long term goal (or goals) and work towards it.  Whether it's bringing the internet, electricity, education etc to the developing world, or creating a startup, make the goal and work towards it.  Let everything you do me motivated by the desire to achieve the goal.  The break is to inspire you and give you ideas, and to release your existing irrelevant worries.

My point, it's true, assumes that more than 0% of vitamin D deficiency is genetic. In other words, my point only stands if the heritability of Vit D levels is greater than 0. From that assumption, I discuss the association between Vit D genetics and T1D. (The heritability of Vit D levels has actually been measured, and has been found to be very high - greater than 60% in some populations - so genetic factors are driving a huge amount of the variation that we see.)<p>If there were an association between T1D and Vit D, you would expect an excess of Vit-D-associated variants among those with T1D when compared to matched individuals. It is true that if 75% of the population is Vit D deficient and most of this is due to environmental effects, this would would hurt your power, requiring a larger study before convincing yourself that the null hypothesis really should not be rejected. Hence the couching of my language with ""so far,"" since I know that associations can definitely be uncovered as sample size increases. But given the high heritability, at least in some populations, we shouldn't need a stratospheric sample size to detect association.",1280296124

It's probably <i>possible</i> to do using lex/yacc, but it's certainly not straightforward, and I wouldn't be surprised if the matching were much slower than a good regexp engine. Parsers seem to be aimed mainly at the case of highly-structured inputs where the stuff you want to find is the entirety of the input, as with source code.

They completely lost every bit of confidence they had, lost interest in studies, and fucked up their college and careers for good.<p>I don't blame the parents. Every parent thinks his son/daughter is the next Einstein and instills this ""get into IIT or you are an utter failure in life"", and sadly this gets drilled into their heads pretty early in life.<p>What needs to be understood is that not every genius in India gets into IIT, because there just aren't enough seats, and there are too many really smart people around. At the end of it, only those who are smart AND work insanely hard get into. And I really don't think any less of anyone who doesn't, like the parents and the students themselves shouldn't.<p>Get this in your head: It doesn't matter if you got into IIT or not. At some point, no one cares. Hell, I don't even have a college degree yet because I keep dropping years, and there are still companies trying to lure me with good development jobs and attractive salaries, which freshers start earning only a few years down the line!

Because it is dangerous and expensive to send people to investigate half-way across the world. That is why most (at least) American news  organizations just pass along un-edited propaganda released by Dept. of State.<p>Often they'll write ""an offical from Dept. of State said..<blah>"" and people are so used to hearing that, they believe <blah> automatically. It is an official,  it is from a major news org and from Dept. of State -- wow, it couldn't possibly be a lie.<p>There are very few honest and idependent news organizations with ""real"" journalists. News companies are not there to provide news for money, they are there to sell audiences to their advertising client and make money mostly from that.<p>Even the military ""embedded"" journalists are ""embedded"" into one side. It is rather naive to expect them to be  objective.<p>I will highlight again, that there are few brave journalists who risk /risked their lives and died in order to provide accurate reports of the situation. But those are very rare exceptions.<p>Now you  provide a link to ""Slate"" where Kaplan claims that Wikileaks is not real ""journalism"" because the news wasn't shocking enough and of course everyone should go to slate.com where real journalists report.<p>Let's take a look at a couple of his quotes:<p><i>These problems were, in fact, the main reasons behind the new strategy that Obama put in place in December 2009—after the period covered by all of the WikiLeaks documents, which date from 2004-09.</i><p>That is true because ... that is what Obama said. It is the standard claim being broadcast from the White House now --  ""Obama is already handling this!"". I've heard this already on the radio and read in other sources. Note how Kaplan just assumes that as the truth and directly quotes the White House. So if Obama has already fixed all this, can we see some results or some documents, some proof that situation got better?<p>Let's look at another quote:<p><i>Journalism, the old saw has it, is the first draft of history. The WikiLeaks documents amount to the first notes of a journalistic story, and incomplete notes at that.</i><p>He seems to be  saying that everyone instead of getting the un-edited data, should get the ""filtered"" data, interpreted by someone. Someone who would put the ""right spin"" on things, perhaps.<p>I am not surprised. He is just defending his profession and his modus operandi. He sees journalists as writing history and here is some renegade kids with a website disrupting the age old process. Bypassing all the filters so carefully put in place over the years.

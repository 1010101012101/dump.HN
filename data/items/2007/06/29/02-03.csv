The person who adds the app can turn of <i>sending</i> them, but I can't turn off the flood of app messages in my incoming news feed.<p>Also, even if you disable the ability for the app to publish items in the news feed, it still publishes the add/remove notification. You have to remove that one manually.<p>As a user, the cluttering of the news feed is my biggest frustration with the new platform--- I don't care if all my friends add this junk, but I should be able to opt out of the messages with the news feed sliders.\n",1183084983

Having a co-founder forces you to choose one thing, define it so that both of you understand it, and then show up every-day to implement it. By yourself, you can always just stop working on an idea and move to something else. You don't have anyone to make commitments to.<p>I used to get annoyed about working with other people because I would lose some control and would be ""bound"" to one idea. Now I see that as a potential good thing, assuming the initial plans are solid and the team is solid.",1183084569

It's kind of funny, because University really made me dislike education/learning so much that I had to go discover all the good stuff on my own.<p>In the article, I definitely agree that we need to get more young people excited about programming and other kinds of engineering (I've heard enrollment is dropping in these areas). <p>I think teachers should show Steve Wozniak interviews in middle schools and high schools. That to me is the true spirit of engineering. It would get kids excited about engineering and show them that it's not just about memorizing formulas and solving homework problems.",1183083276

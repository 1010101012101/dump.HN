I've also been lucky enough to have my apartment burglarized by someone who lives in the park so this article was of personal interest.  I followed the comment thread on SFGate and found some links to this fellow's YouTube videos and his old blog:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/zebu111"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/zebu111</a><p><a href=""http://skylarthomas.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skylarthomas.blogspot.com/</a><p>He also seems to be active on this forum:\n<a href=""http://www.bobfreemanboard.com/showthread.php?t=12686"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bobfreemanboard.com/showthread.php?t=12686</a><p>If you read his other threads, it is obvious he's got some sort of mental illness.",1217649428

264739,comment,264282,264282,0,0,dshah,,,"We've hired several salespeople, and have been successful with it.  Here are the things I'd figure out before going too far:<p>1.  Do you need ""transactional"" selling (lots of small deals), or more ""consultative/solution"" selling.<p>2.  How important is domain expertise for you?  Do you need someone with an existing rolodex or will you supply the leads?<p>3.  How much risk are you expecting the salesperson to take?  How much will be base compensation and how much will be commission driven?<p>4.  Are you looking for someone with demonstrated experience, or will someone more junior work?<p>We've experimented with variations on all of the above to find the right ""pattern"" for us (in terms of what works and what doesn't).",1217647292

264732,comment,264685,264685,0,0,bkbleikamp,,,"They are afraid of: Google, cloud computing, online office applications, Linux, OS X, and any competitor who can develop applications faster and (arguably) better than they can (i.e. 37signals products that are developed fast and appeal to a niche market that would never substitute a Microsoft product in place of one of 37signal's).<p>Their problem is software no longer takes millions of dollars and hundreds of people to create - it can be done by a small team with almost no budget.  Also the distribution platform is the web, not retail.<p>They missed the memo a decade ago that things were changing and now they're playing catch up :)",1217646411

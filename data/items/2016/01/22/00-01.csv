The company I work for is sitting on a pile of cash while at the same time seeing a downtrend in revenue, buying back shares and paying out dividends.  In theory the company should be investing this money in building future products, but it&#x27;s not.<p>It&#x27;s a combination of many factors.  CEOs and management aren&#x27;t motivated to invest in the long term of companies.  A lot of big companies are structured so it is very difficult for them to apply capital in a way that facilitates growth.  They are risk averse.  This is esp. true when there is an air of global economic uncertainty like we&#x27;ve had over the last decade or so.  This produces motivation to have a large capital safety buffer (because e.g. if you don&#x27;t have capital you wouldn&#x27;t be able to borrow it).  In turn this compounds the problem.  We are in a low inflation environment so you can sit on your money without losing much value.  Tax considerations force capital to remain where it can&#x27;t effectively be used so US companies don&#x27;t bring their cash back to spend in the US because they are trying to save the tax.<p>Individuals are also very cautious because of economic uncertainty.

Manufacturers request a range of these unique numbers from the IEEE, and are never meant to duplicate them. When you connect to a WiFi router, you connect to its friendly name (SSID), but also your phone receives a part of this special unique number (BSSID address) [1].<p>Companies like Apple, Google, and SkyHook, record the location of WiFi routers using this unique number. When a phone or other device has a strong GPS location and a strong WiFi signal, they can fairly reliably assume that this unique number is at this specific location.<p>However, not all manufacturers strictly follow the unique number allocation rule, as getting allocations can be a time consuming process. 999 times out of 1000, reuse of these numbers is not a big issue, and goes undetected. In this case, it is likely that the thieves are using, or are located near, a WiFi router with the same unique number as this couple. Changing this special unique number is sometimes possible on expensive enterprise grade WiFi routers by knowledgeable experts, but not possible or advisable on home routers. The couple should change their WiFi router.&quot;<p>Yes, I have conflated a number of terms there for simplicity. For technical accuracy: WiFi router -> access point.<p>Edit: added [1] <a href=""https://arubanetworkskb.secure.force.com/pkb/articles/FAQ/How-is-the-BSSID-derived-from-the-Access-Point-ethernet-MAC-address"" rel=""nofollow"">https://arubanetworkskb.secure.force.com/pkb/articles/FAQ/Ho...</a><p>As BSSID is != MAC address.",1453421917

What happens if the HQ gets hacked and all private keys and public keys are leaked (say, by an adversarial nation-state)? The device becomes useless from a security standpoint until a software/firmware upgrade occurs, and then there&#x27;s no guarantee that HQ didn&#x27;t have an advanced persistent threat installed.

I&#x27;m not sure what you have in mind - there was never any Edenic period where you could run dynamic web blogs for free on your own server without any configuration or investment of time and dedication. All the old tools still exist, but better and polished by time.<p>Let&#x27;s compare modern blogging to how you would have blogged in 1996, or when Berners-Lee launched the first documents at CERN, your workflow looked like &#x27;write .html file, FTP to server, Apache serves static files to anyone who visits&#x27;. In 2016, your workflow, <i>if you want to</i>, looks like... &#x27;write .html file, SCP to server, nginx serves static files to anyone who visits&#x27;. You can still write HTML5 by hand, it&#x27;s not harder than original HTML (may be easier). You can write Markdown which compiles to HTML with no more fuss than &#x27;markdown.pl foo.md foo.html&#x27; or &#x27;pandoc foo.md -o foo.html&#x27;.<p>You don&#x27;t want to run a server? That&#x27;s fine, find a host like S3 and instead of &#x27;scp&#x27;, &#x27;s3cmd&#x27;. It&#x27;ll cost you next to nothing compared to back then.<p>You want some sort of blog software? There must be a million which are not named &#x27;Wordpress&#x27; and do not have endless security nightmares. You want static site generators? Likewise, millions. WSIYWG HTML editors? Likewise. Free hosting? At this point almost any large site offers blog-like functionality because hosting is so cheap.<p>But what is <i>harder</i>? If you want to run your own server, everything is infinitely easy than in 1996. Apt-get may or may not have existed in 1996, but I&#x27;m sure it was far less comprehensive and reliable than it is now. You can let your server run for many years without upgrading if you want, and when you do upgrade, it&#x27;s a few commands. Why, you don&#x27;t even need to compile a kernel or buy a server edition of your OS. It has never been easier nor cheaper to run your own website in a myriad of different methods.\nSo what exactly has gotten &#x27;so damn complicated&#x27;?<p>The reality is that most people, and especially casuals, do not care that much about high-quality publishing or control or reliability, and instead care more about extreme convenience and network effects, and often either have nothing to say or don&#x27;t want to say it and so no matter how polished your static site generator is, they couldn&#x27;t care less.

Indeed, any computing machine that follows a Turing model would be highly inefficient to simulate the activity of biological neurons and experience an increased slowdown. Since the super-Turing computing power of the brain has its origins in these ‘strong’ interactions that occur inside neurons, current models have missed the most important part. Simply, Nature doesn’t care if the N-body problem has analytical solutions [36] or can be simulated in real time on a Turing machine [37].<p>...<p>While previous models have attempted to represent Hamiltonians using Turing machines [35] the paper [1] shows that the Hamiltonian model of interaction can represent itself a far more powerful model of computation. Turing made an important step forward; however, there is no need to limit natural models of computation to Turing models. In this sense, the new framework of computation using interaction is universal in nature and provides a more general description of computation than the formal Turing model. In other words God was unaware of Turing&#x27;s work and has put forward a better model for physical computation in the brain.</i>",1435441976

The way we&#x27;re doing it is probably the most dysfunctional system for software development I could possibly imagine.<p>Let me set the stage.<p>I&#x27;m working with 100+ other developers and probably 300+ total people on this one project. We&#x27;re subdivided into 20 scrum teams of ~5 developers each.<p>So far so good.<p>The problem is that I&#x27;m working for a non-tech Fortune 25 company. The person who signs our checks and justified this project is literally six levels of management above me and reports directly to the CEO. To quantify progress and justify the cost (hundreds of millions of dollars) our project is treated as its own organization which has to satisfy a service-level agreement (SLA). This SLA contains completely arbitrary metrics like velocity, defect count, and myriad other things which are only tangentially related to software quality and execution.<p>This has resulted in the most ridiculous management strategy wherein everything is locally optimized rather than globally optimized. Here are some examples:<p>1. At the end of every three week sprint, there&#x27;s a rush to complete stories because if anything is moved, management looks bad. Software engineering standards go out the window because there&#x27;s literally not enough hours in the day, and nobody is willing to work overtime just to make some manager look better.<p>2. Speaking of poor software engineering standards, there&#x27;s so much pressure to close defects immediately that the standard practice is to hotfix/patch everything rather than solve underlying issues. This has created enormous amounts of technical debt in our code base, making working on anything you haven&#x27;t touched nearly impossible.<p>3. We&#x27;re subjected to completely arbitrary pressure any time we&#x27;re missing the metrics in our SLA. We&#x27;re not in production or even close to it, and yet our management has had the gall to force six day work weeks across the entire project so the defect count could be brought down. Our strategy? More hotfixing/patching and pushing defects off to other teams, because when you&#x27;re giving up your Saturday based on some completely imagined emergency, there isn&#x27;t much incentive to do things the right way.<p>The end result? Extremely brittle software which satisfies acceptance criteria and has a pretty veneer, but will break the moment you sneeze on it. 200 million dollars well spent.",1435441848

Yeah, maybe someone else should investigate, but someone should. Maybe that particular phenomena that lead to the water influencing your result will give you knowledge about cell metabolism.

9791628,comment,9790437,9791193,0,0,sirclueless,,,"I disagree here, because the inevitable result of a highly visible series of failed reproductions is a big media hit. The scientific community may be able to poke holes in the reproduction attempt and sort through the damage, but the media and the court of public opinion certainly can&#x27;t. Not until long after the reputations of possibly faultless scientists have been ruined irreparably.<p>So it&#x27;s important for the reproduction attempts to be as high quality and rigorous as we would hope the original studies were. And it behooves scientists to make sure that these attempts are legitimate, unbiased and equitable, and to investigate any experimental flaws and biases of the experimenters before the results.<p>Misgivings about a reproduction attempt don&#x27;t indicate denial of the validity of the scientific process, but recognition of the volatility of scientific news media. The unfortunate reality is that both sides of this effort, both original researchers and reproduction attempts, are subject to a great number of biases and restrictions. Subjective opinion does deeply affect the lives of scientists, and it&#x27;s not possible for even the best scientists to live in a bubble of scientific purity and assume things will work out.",1435441612

In the past there were financial benefits given to everyone who was married rather than waiting till they have children to encourage couples to have children. Also because in western culture we are raised with the idea that a man will support a woman so she can stay in the home whether or not they have kids. All these implicit assumptions are gone now that gays are married. Gay couples are much more likely to be self-sufficient and not have one partner who relies on the other. When a heterosexual couple divorces, the wife takes half even though most often she did not contribute financially to the marriage because there is an implicit idea here that the man is providing ALL the financial support in the relationship. Tax and work benefits also make this assumption and so now we are going to have a lot of gays trying to cash in on all these marriage benefits even though they are most usually not supporting their spouse nor ever going to have children. These issues did not come up in the past because there were hardly any married gays, but now that gay marriage is federally legal you are going to see more legal and statistical definitions distinguishing between marriages where a spouse supports their significant other and possibly children and and marriages who dont.

No, of course not.  Because that&#x27;s not an interesting question.

But at first, you find that all of your control cells die.  And eventually you find out that if you use brand X of bottled water vs tap water, the control cells thrive.  Are you seriously proposing that you should then drop all work on drug X, and get to work determining <i>exactly</i> what is up with the tap water in your town?  I mean, <i>maybe</i> that would be a fruitful research avenue, if you&#x27;re worried that the tap water isn&#x27;t safe for human consumption, or you think that there&#x27;s something interesting about exactly how the tap water is killing your control cells.  But most of the time, investigating the tap water would be an expensive distraction from the question you actually want to answer.  And most scientists, I think, would (reasonably) decide to get on with investigating the effects of drug X on their cells, and not worry too much about precisely why the tap water killed the control cells.

You are correct that the speed at which the Dutch have overtaken other nearby populations is kind of surprising.  A nutrition differential could make that much difference, but it seems like general nutrition shouldn&#x27;t differ much at all between the Dutch, the Belgians, the French, etc.  Another possibility is just the the Dutch are genetically a little bit taller on average if you normalize nutrition.  But it doesn&#x27;t seem like Dutch genetics should differ that much from the surrounding populations either.  Could natural selection have made that much difference in Dutch genetics in just a few generations, and recent (post Industrial Revolution) generations at that?",1435438905

An no damn daylight savings time. Of course, it would make a lot of sense to put the beginning of the year at the beginning of the first month of spring, not the _second_ month of winter.

Even though its results were often hit-or-miss, there were enough hits for it to be a valuable resource.<p>And unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know of any comparable alternative.  (But please tell me if you do!)<p>Here is the problem it solved:<p>It let you discover members of a set by entering a few members that you already know.<p>For instance, if you enter &quot;terrier,&quot; &quot;bulldog,&quot; &quot;German shepherd,&quot; it might return, &quot;beagle,&quot; &quot;poodle,&quot; &quot;chihuahua.&quot;<p>Obviously, in this example, it would probably be just as easy to Google &quot;list dog breeds.&quot;<p>But what if you know a few members of a set ... but don&#x27;t actually know what the set is, or the proper way to describe the set to a search engine?<p>Or what if the search engine results take you to pages that list some related terms, but you&#x27;ve got to sift through a lot of other content to get to them?<p>That&#x27;s when Google Sets really came in handy.<p>Edit: I admit, Google has gotten a lot better in recent years at returning this sort of information in search results.

Just handling all these buffer overflows is going to make a fairly big difference in computer security.  I also imagine things like IPS&#x27;s are going to trickle down to client devices like laptops and phones.  We have enough extra CPU power to check every packet for known exploits and  pro-actively stop things like XSS or SQL injections.<p>We are also probably looking at the dawn of the locked down desktop that can only access installable software from the OS store which will deliver only signed and vetted software.  Our largest exploit right now is just being able to send someone a hyperlink to trojan.exe and having them run it.  End users will always fall for that unless the OS stops them.<p>A higher level of app security and app behavior nannying is probably coming our way. If you have a Windows machine you can install EMET right now. There are rumors EMET&#x27;s functionality will be baked into Win10.<p>This period reminds of the pre-Nader peroid in American automotive history. Manufacturers competed on HP, large sizes, etc and not on safety, efficiency, etc.  We&#x27;re asking for the wrong things.  Now that things like low power chipsets, SSDs, and multi-cores are the norm, its time for the industry to focus on security. It&#x27;ll get there -- dragged, kicking and screaming eventually.  Especially in the age of bitcoin which makes Cryptolocker ransomware payments anonymous. More code reviews and more forks and clones aren&#x27;t going to win this. There needs to be a holistic change in how we create and deploy software and this change needs to be in demand.  The real question is, are we incentivized to make this change yet? Why aren&#x27;t we asking for better security?",1425653956

9157254,comment,9156405,9157120,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Even GPU rates are absolute crap compared to ASICs, and that&#x27;s the top-end cards used for gaming. You generally get a few hundred MH/S at a few hundred dollars, for example a GTX580 at $200 used gives you about 150 MH/S. So 0.75 MH/S/$. Compare that to ASICs that can get 3000 MH/S/$. Meanwhile the graphics card is a huge power hog, at 244 watts the GTX580 will cost you $320 in electricity if ran 365/24/7 at an OECD average.<p>So let&#x27;s plug it into today&#x27;s hashrate calculator: $0.15c, if ran for a year 100% maxed out 24/7. Imagine we lower that to 25% usage, 8 hours a day, and you get roughly 1 cent. Oh and these hashrates are growing exponentially so it&#x27;s likely much, much lower.<p>So even if you do this year-round, you&#x27;d blow your user&#x27;s graphics card in a year, generate $320 in extra electricity costs and make 15c (very optimistic estimate), and completely lock up 100% usage of his graphics card 24/7.<p>And that&#x27;s for a decent gaming card that you can buy at $200 used today. Don&#x27;t mind the millions of torrenters who use laptops with on-board shitty cards who just want to pirate Netflix.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s relevant as I just checked the CPU rates because users in the thread mentioned their CPU went up while idle that hadn&#x27;t happened before, indicating they&#x27;re CPU mining as opposed to GPU mining (which is probably easier than configuring for different cards, and allows mining on computers with a decent CPU and a shitty on-board video card for non-gaming.)<p>So I still think it&#x27;s the dumbest idea ever.",1425653919

My sister was looking for an alternative to Paint Shop Pro for the simple graphics she does, and she didn&#x27;t want to pay for the next version if she could get something free. Without thinking, I suggested Paint.net, as I&#x27;ve always enjoyed using it over The Gimp on Windows. She went to getpaint.net and, of course, ended up with nothing but adware because the guy behind Paint.net is a talented but very greedy individual[1]. I should have instead pointed her to ninite.com and told her to download Paint.net there. Now she won&#x27;t trust Paint.net no matter where it comes from, which is a shame because for what she needed it was more than enough.<p>That&#x27;s only one of several cases where I&#x27;ve recommended a truly good, open source or freeware app for Windows, to have the person become angry with me for sending them on a spyware-laden wild goose chase.

It&#x27;s problem was that it didn&#x27;t have a purpose - no one really knew what to do with it because a &quot;Wave&quot; was presented an amorphous blob of &quot;knowledge&quot; that people could contribute to at the same time. It was an online notepad, sketchbook, and spreadsheet all at the same time, yet it was also none of those things because you couldn&#x27;t easily get the document out of Wave.<p>Wave was a textbook example of how you can fail if people don&#x27;t understand why they should use your product. They gave up on it (by handing it to the Apache Foundation where it continues to be developed), rolled the clever collaboration technology into Google Docs, and told everyone they&#x27;d made it so you could edit a doc at the same time as someone else.

Targeting and performance/conversion tracking.<p>To give you an example, imagine you own a gym and you are recruiting members. I think with a really well targeted campaign to 1,000 people could yield a 5% signup rate over a month, 50 people. That&#x27;s a guess, but I think it&#x27;s not unreasonable. Most gyms would gladly pay $50-$100 per member for that result, so $2,500-$5,000 to target 1,000 people.<p>That means a single SME advertiser could pay half the current price of a netflix subscription for a 1000 . Obviously, those 1,000 people will be targeted by more than one advertiser.<p>Targeting & performance tracking are super enhancers. A significant improvement in either of these can yield 10X improvements in ad performance and similar increases in ad revenue. Scale is very important. So are supporting assets, good data sources and ways of creating links between them.<p>FB already has the best (by far, IMO) platform for creating target groups and one of the best platforms for attribution/performance tracking/conversion tracking. You can upload a list of you gym members and get back an &quot;audience&quot; of their friends, who are 25-40, live in the area… Then you can subdivide it into single women, married women, married men, single men, etc. and try different ads for different people. That&#x27;s the kind of improvement over TV ads that creates a 1000X increase in value per second of advertising airtime.<p>*Reading back, it seems from my comments that I&#x27;m asserting a lot of things fairly confidently.

Some modifications we made was to replace the delivery process with one that looked up the mail storage backend a given user was on and passed on the mail to qmails normal delivery process.<p>We also modified the delivery process to embed additional information in the message file names so that we could get away with just reading the directory to get file size (instead of additional stat() calls for each file), flag status etc.<p>Eventually we added quota checking and a cache of parsed header information (coupled with a custom command added to the POP server to list that info).<p>Qmail was ideal for that given that it consists of a bunch of small, easily understood components that all are documented extremely well and can be tested on the command line.<p>For the queueing system, any mail system works fine if your requirements does not include absolute ordering. All we needed to do was poll a Maildir (or POP server) to handle incoming messages, or inject outbound e-mail for outbound messages. It was fast and simple at a time when there was a distinct lack of open source dedicated queueing implementations.",1425652693

9157048,comment,9156789,9156789,0,0,bgraves,,,"I spoke last week to 50-60 middle school students (ages 12-14) during a day long S.T.E.M demo day. There were 4 sessions with 10-15 kids in each hour-long session. My theme was &quot;Learn to Program&quot; and why <i>everyone</i> should learn to read and write code.<p>For the first 20 minutes, I reviewed some slides (the &quot;who&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, &quot;why&quot; of programming). For the rest of the time, we built a Flappy Bird game using the tutorials on code.org. This made everything &quot;click&quot; for them, since it was hands on and practical. Suddenly, abstractions like variables and events make sense when you think of them like &quot;background scene&quot; and &quot;click&quot;.<p>After they loaded their personalized Flappy Bird game to their iPhone, we spent the rest of the time going through CodeCombat. Lots of kids really liked this because it was a game you play with code.<p>I wish I had a bit more time to do something purely creative (there&#x27;s a &quot;Frozen&quot; movie art tutorial on code.org, but it&#x27;s slower paced and would&#x27;ve taken up too much of my time)<p>---<p>A few takeaways:<p>1. You HAVE to make it interesting. Kids today need to go from zero to awesome in 2 minutes or less. I don&#x27;t see this as a bad thing. When I learned to program, I wanted the same thing. Being able to write some stuff in Notepad and see a webpage in Internet Explorer in 1995 is what got me interested in programming in the first place. I wanted them to get that same feeling.<p>2. Focus on them. How is computer science going to help them? Basically, these kids (or their parents or teachers) are your customer and you have to make the benefits obvious. I talked about the creative aspects (&quot;stretching your mind&quot;), the career path aspects (&quot;Bill Gates and Mark Z started when they were in middle school&quot;), and the long term impact on the world (&quot;Bill and Mark are two of the most generous people on the planet&quot;). Again, this is aimed at middle schoolers so I&#x27;m not going to get into the politics of anti-trust lawsuits or over-reaching privacy concerns.<p>3. Only about 10% of the kids in a classroom are going to be really enthusiastic about learning this stuff. You&#x27;ll have 80% that are indifferent and 10% that are bored/lost. That&#x27;s okay. Not everyone is going to be interested in computer science just like not everyone is into music.<p>4. I didn&#x27;t get too deep to quick, just focused on helping them seeing results. I didn&#x27;t get into any nitty gritty like is JavaScript better than Python or anything too technical at all. Keep it as high-level as you possible can.<p>5. I also let them work things out. &quot;Oh, your Flappy Bird isn&#x27;t flapping when you click your mouse? Hmmm, which piece of code do you think handles when you click your mouse? Do you see any actions that you could attach to that event that might make your bird flap?&quot;<p>---<p>Overall, it was well received and there were a few kids that used their &quot;Genius Hour&quot; (a set time where they could further explore the STEM topics they learned about on their own) to go through more CodeCombat lessons.<p>I would definitely do it again, but really needed a nap afterwards.

9157035,comment,9156405,9156405,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"That&#x27;s really dumb, bad for users, bad for the environment and without clear benefits to uTorrent.<p>Why? Because ASICS that&#x27;s why.<p>To illustrate. A Macbook Pro bought a few years ago costs $1200 today. Its CPU will get you 1.8 megahash per second. It uses about 250 watt at max CPU.<p>Meanwhile, an ASIC today costing about $350 will get you over 1 million MH/S and its max watt usage is about 590.<p>Considering uTorrent isn&#x27;t specialized mining software, and considering you&#x27;ll only use about 25% of CPU or so (and that is way too much itself), you&#x27;re looking at being able to run about 10 million megahash per second on an ASIC for the same cost of running 2 MH/S on a MBP.<p>Now consider that this ASIC is available to you and me, and that even better ASICS are used by mining farms in China with access to electricity that&#x27;s 2x - 4x cheaper than what you&#x27;re paying at home, purchased at factory prices even lower than the $350 I mentioned above.<p>What does it all mean? It means that if you run a Macbook Pro at today&#x27;s hashrate for 30 years, 24/7 at 100% of CPU, you will earn $0.07.<p>So just think about what uTorrent is doing to you. If they took 50% of your CPU for the 8 hours you use your device each day the next year, they&#x27;d make 1/25th of a single penny, and that 50% extra CPU would cost you about $20 in electricity, and reduce the lifetime of your computer.<p>This idea would have been brilliant years ago, before ASICs. Today it&#x27;s one of the dumbest ideas in the world. It can cost your users tens of dollars, slow down their computers, reduce the lifetime of their hardware and generates virtually no money for you in the process.<p>Even with 1 million Macbook Pros running this year round, they&#x27;d make $700 while generating tens of millions in extra electricity costs.<p>If they think that 1 million users opening their app every single day and running it for 8 hours to generate $700 is a lasting business model, then I think that&#x27;s very telling of where uTorrent is headed. I say that even if it didn&#x27;t cost users 50% of their CPU and a few dollars a month in the process.<p>-- quick edit: Bitcoin would actually be a very interesting usecase for torrent technology. You could for example attach a bitcoin address to each torrent packet. Then a torrent client could verify if the packet contains valid data (like normal), and automatically send a microreward (e.g. 1/millionth of a penny) back to whoever supplied you that packet. Each user could connect a bitcoin wallet and set a reward for various things he&#x27;s downloading (e.g. $1 for a 1960s vintage album that can&#x27;t be found anywhere, or 1 cent for the guy sending him House of Cards).<p>You could completely monetize seeders on a voluntary pay-what-you-want basis. And uTorrent could offer an option to send 1% of these &#x27;donations&#x27; to uTorrent itself automatically. It&#x27;d generate a lot more revenue than mining, while costing the user a fraction, and incentivize seeding of a whole range of new content and make torrenting more popular than ever, without having to rely on centralized payment systems that would shut it down immediately.<p>It&#x27;s just one of many ideas. I&#x27;m all for cryptocurrency and torrents, but this particular product just makes no sense.",1425651229

9157001,comment,9156348,9156601,0,0,mason55,,,"> <i>if you could combine a streaming TV service with Netflix-like penetration using FB login and FB ad targeting, I&#x27;d wager you could make more in ad revenue using only a small fraction of airtime than traditional TV. IE 10 second &quot;preroll&quot; ads, unobtrusive banner ads (on pause, buffer, etc) with FB&#x27;s targeting would earn more per viewer than traditional TV&#x27;s.</i><p>It&#x27;s coming.  The next wave in advertising will be ad targeting based on addressable set top boxes, which basically means targeted video ads on TV.  Advertisers will be able to do things like &quot;make sure each household sees my ad five times&quot; to avoid cases where people who watch lots of TV see it twenty times and people who don&#x27;t watch much only see it once.  With addressable STB&#x27;s + microtargeting there will be a whole new set of companies for which it will be profitable to advertise on TV.  Right now the long tail of niche companies has no chance of profitably advertising on TV because their target only makes up a very, very, very small percentage of an individual program (think about a company advertising Bitcoin ASIC&#x27;s for example).  But if they get addressability + microtargeting right then they can make sure that only households which are interested in Bitcoin ASIC&#x27;s see the ads.<p><a href=""https://www.experian.com/assets/marketing-services/white-papers/audience-iq-addressable-tv-wp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.experian.com/assets/marketing-services/white-pap...</a>",1425650603

From my own experience the former is likely to be a total waste of time with no outcome for your startup, whereas in electronics-related shows you will definitely meet some new suppliers, retailers, investors (and of course your competitors too). You almost always leave a consumer electronics show with <i>something</i>. Just curious, why is this?",1425650519

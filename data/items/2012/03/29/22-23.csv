I just need to learn how to parse correctly and replace.<p>I have 4 basic page layouts, but only 2 that I regularly generate content for.  The header, footer, nav bar, sidebars, and major layout DIV's on these pages are all constant.  I'd like to be able to take a text document of paragraphs and run it through the parser that would apply <p>'s to the paragraphs and format the image links properly based on some sort of predefined replacement markup.<p>This is where I fall down.  I need to figure out how to parse and I'm not finding any links to learn.  I can read lines and stick open and close <p>'s on newlines, but the parsing of stuff inline is where I'm stuck.",1333061958

Nothing a smart team couldn't figure out.<p>Most of the time, men trust women when they say they're on birth control. Women get pregnant--a big deal. It's less likely (but not unheard of) that a woman wants to get pregnant and then lies about birth control.<p>Men, on the other hand, would love to not use a condom. And men don't get pregnant. So saying ""yeah baby, I've had my shots"" would probably be a lot more common.<p>You'd need to market this to couples. Relationships with trust--not teenagers. Or, as an ""and-1"", extra step prevention. Not as a first line of defense. Then, the low cost would be more of an extra procedure that would get them thinking more about being safer. You wouldn't hang your business model on it but could actually do more business by offering it.<p>Lastly, being a man, the idea of someone putting forceps in my scrotum gives me the willies.

A woman on the pill can have sex without protection (though there are obvious caveats, of course, know/trust your partner, etc. etc.) and still be assured of results, whereas for a man he pretty much has to either be wearing a condom (uncomfortable) or have had a vasectomy.<p>This would be another round of equalization, better for everyone.",1333061750

As far as I know only the Transformer Prime and I think Motorola Xoom got 4.0, but those were already Honeycomb devices, and I believe they were significantly easier to upgrade to 4.0.<p>But I understand your concerns. For me the actual disappointment came from announcing the Nexus One would not receive it at all. The internal storage and the GPU might indeed suck for 4.0, but I find it hard to believe  that there was absolutely no way to upgrade it, especially from the makers of Android. I'd expect a Nexus device to get at least 2 major version upgrades (so a 4.0 device would get 5.0 and 6.0, in this case).<p>Still, the Nexus tablet is something Google should've done a long time ago, and I was <i>very</i> surprised they didn't release a Nexus tablet in the same time with the Galaxy Nexus, to celebrate the unification of the phone and tablet software.

It would probably just look like a pen or pencil drawing.<p>Basically it is drawing with a piece of silver wire. The mark is very faint, especially on paper. To get enough silver to deposit, you often use paper covered with a ground of some kind, like gesso or very find sand or grit in a sizing of some kind.<p>Over time the silver tarnishes and darkens, but it has a luster about it that would be very difficult to photograph or scan. If you don't want the silver to tarnish, you can coat the work with a modern sealer, but no one really knows how that will age over the years.<p>One of the ways of drawing with silver point is to ""glaze"" over the work by tracing and retracing over the forms, to build up a fusion of the marking material.  This <i>can</i> result in a very cloudy, diffuse rendering that still has a definite graphic look to it.<p>Very time consuming and it's hard to judge when to stop since the image is so faint.<p>One artist I knew used to spray the silver with chemicals to ""develop"" the image to a certain point, and then neutralize it when it had reached the darkness level he wanted, and then he sealed it.<p>You can also draw with gold wire, the markings are a faint yellow brownish color, but they have a definite luster to them.  The gold doesn't tarnish like the silver, so you don't have the change over time. Depends on the effect you want I guess.<p>There was an artist in recent years who did these very large semi-photo real silver and gold point drawings. Several feet across.  A reproduction simply cannot do them justice.

It's not any of those, but Apple is so tight-lipped about their decision making that no one articulates why they make the choices they do.

Apple (and their third-party developers) know that most people never change the defaults.<p>However, they don't really want to ship single-button hardware. Here's what most people don't realize: <i>Apple knows it's a less expressive device.</i> Back when they shipped real one button mice, their advanced users were forced to BYOHID. The hardware that Apple shipped was wasted. That sucks.<p>To resolve this dilemma Apple devised the Mighty Mouse (later the Magic Mouse).

As far as we know, you can't do much really to bias an aptitude test in terms of biology because there is little correlation between race and biology. On the other hand, culture and race are relatively tightly correlated, so if you want to bias an aptitude test with respect to race, the surest way to do it is to bias it with respect to culture.<p>A great example is Jim Crow era voting rules. Black people obviously are not biologically disinclined to be able to read, but in 1900, it was a simple fact of southern American culture that a white person of voting age was less likely to be able to read than a black person of voting age. A black southerner of voting age was usually either a former slave, or the child of a former slave, and slaves did not have access to basic education. So a literacy test was, at that time, a racially biased test.<p>---<p> This is unsurprising when you realize, for example, that the combined population we put in the single box of ""black"" is more genetically diverse than the combined population of all the races we put outside of that box.

3773340,comment,3772292,3772917,11,0,egiva,,,"> This isn't true at all. They haven't been shown to be biased, merely that blacks score lower. Extensive research has show that IQ tests have equal predictive power for blacks and whites.<p>I think you illustrate the danger of making assertions without being entirely informed - that is to say that what you state here is the beginning of the truth, but taken out of context. There was (and in many cases still is) a heavy cultural bias built into standardized IQ testing. Traditionally, most tests were developed and tested against middle-income, white children. Black children traditionally tested one standard deviation below their white counterparts, even when controlling for income, etc. However, many experts agree that this is due to cultural bias and environmental factors, agravated by the strong corelation between income and where you live geographically in the US, including resources (or lack thereof) in corresponding school districts. Example: children in troubled, inner-city schools would often have less access to rigourous IQ testing when compared to their urban, middle-class counterparts.<p>There is also the complicating factor of single-parent or broken homes and the roll that plays in a child's lack of overall intellectual development. This also correlates to income and geographic area (i.e. innercity versus urban environment).<p>> I've never understood why eliminating one of the few objective measures and making the hiring process entirely subjective was an improvement.<p>That's another subject and worth talking about. I'm simply stating that you should be very careful when talking about the black-white gap in IQ scores. There are too many factors at play to make a clear case for IQ differences between races.<p>For an informative article with really enlightening references, see this: <a href=""http://theafrican.com/Magazine/IQ.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theafrican.com/Magazine/IQ.htm</a>",1333058720

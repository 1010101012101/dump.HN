You should almost have put a warning at the top, that a reader might want to think about the problem, before reading your answer. :-)<p>I'm convinced and will try Devel::REPL, instead of ""traditional"" one-liners.",1239346334
555811,comment,555383,555484,0,0,jgrant27,,,"There's recursion and then there's tail recursion. Recursion is idiomatic of all functional languages. Using the loop macro as in your example is iterative and hence some of the contention about whether that is idiomatic for a functional language such as CL. Some would say that this is a a purist argument but some things are actually easier to write recursively.",1239346291

Greene in the book carefully puts together an array of interesting stories of famous leaders, generals, businessman that makes the book enjoyable to read whether or not one agrees with his laws.<p>My favourite chapter was ""Enter action with boldness"" which had in it a story of a poor Korean man named Huh Saeng.\n<a href=""http://wisdomportal.com/Enlightenment/Huh-Saeng.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wisdomportal.com/Enlightenment/Huh-Saeng.html</a><p>And I would add that ""doing good work"" gives you the confidence to ""enter action with boldness"".",1239345806

Forget the fact that it steals link love (which in the long run will result in stolen revenue), it changes how my site looks to everyone following through the link.<p>For some odd reason, you seem to think that people should 'not' be getting mad because they aren't 'entitled' to how their site looks to everyone.<p>What?<p>P.S. Please don't spout that ignorant bullshit about firefox doing the same thing. It does NOT. If firefox hid site URLs by giving them all new short URLs like www.firefox.com/d1hyfg, people would dump firefox a lot faster than they're dumping the diggbar.",1239344910

It's not wildly useful for TV (I use it for radio mostly) because the quality and speed are often flaky.

604437,comment,604306,604394,0,0,axod,,,"Simple method would be to try and load content from often blocked domains and see if it loads properly or not using js. I did this a while ago and measured the 6% firefox users using adblock.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  // cb = function to call with result\n  function detectAdblock(cb) {\n      var tt = document.createElement(""div"");\n      tt.style.display = ""none"";\n      document.body.appendChild(tt);\n      var i = document.createElement(""iframe"");\n      i.src = ""http://adv.foo.com/ads/-adspace?ad_id=&affiliate=&advert=678"";\n      var foo = i.style.cssText;\n      tt.appendChild(i);\n      window.setTimeout(function() {\n          cb(foo!=i.style.cssText);\n      }, 200);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis works because adblock is pretty primitive and just checks for keywords in the iframe src, and if there sets the visibility or display css style etc.<p>To get around adblock, you can proxy through your own domain, and stay clear of showing the ads in iframe/image/flash. Use js to put them in with everything else as text links which perform far better than any other type of advertising anyway.",1242079672

I agree that if you are a Lamp stack web app -- or most any web 2.0 startup -- Bizspark probably can't offer you much.

Never mind the wide range of vertical applications for businesses that almost exclusively run windows. Microsoft's ecosystems is huge and very capable of sustaining quite a few startups. These startups need Windows, Office, and Visual Studio licenses. Of course they will include IIS and Asp.net in their list of benefits. Besides, Asp.net really isn't all that bad of a choice if you just need a company homepage or some kind of low volume or limited access web service.",1242079545

It is not just bash, which is very important tool, but in the first place Emacs, GCC, Binutils, GNU make, flex, bison - all the development tools which made possible the raise of early BSD and Linux systems. It is impossible to imagine the world of free, open source software without GNU toolchan.<p>Nowadays I very much like the example of nginx - it has bigger market share than IIS, while originally was a solo effort, compared to millions of dollars and man-hours which have been spent on development and marketing of IIS.

This is a perfect fix, because attackers can never choose the <i>names</i> of environment variables, because we know that that&#x27;s a poor idea (anyone who does it is already vulnerable to people setting LD_PRELOAD and similar things). This is simply marking certain variables as executable, while everything else is not.<p>The default assumption, like it or not, is that if you set some random environment variable to some random text, nothing&#x27;s going to happen. It&#x27;s been like that since 1993, at the latest.<p>> If you think in 2014 that the control path from &quot;HTTP GET&quot; to &quot;200 OK&quot; (adapt for your favorite protocol) on a modern stack should involve launching the shell with user controlled environment variables, you just can&#x27;t be taken seriously.<p>Some things end up managing the system - DHCP, for example. It turns out that the shell is really, really good at managing *nix systems. Everyone can understand it, and everyone can figure out how to manage their system with it. The only real alternative would be perl, which nobody wants to code in, and has a greater learning barrier.<p>As for modern web frameworks - of course they shouldn&#x27;t use CGI, although more because there&#x27;s better/more performant alternatives than for security reasons.

For me, I don't want those features in iTunes because I feel that <i>those features</i> are hindered by being shoved into iTunes, not necessarily the other way around.<p>Examples:<p>* (As I stated in another thread): I wish the iTunes store was just on the web. Being inside of iTunes, I get a ""web like"" experience that is encumbered. I can't open multiple tabs, and this often drives me crazy. On Amazon.com, or <i>any</i> online store, I'm often given lots of suggestions, good suggestions. I like to open them up in lots of tabs and then read them one by one, or just keep them around until later. Can't do it on the iTunes store! Also, it is often difficult to get links to items. ALSO, why should I only be allowed to see the store essentially when at home on my iTunes? If it was on the web, I could browser, get the link, email it to myself, and make the purchase when I get home. If they want to force you to buy through iTunes, they could still make a custom URL that popped iTunes open just for the downloading portion.<p>* Movies and TV Shows. The management of these just kind of sucks on iTunes, and the reason is because this is MUSIC player, and music organization is very different to video organization. They are forced into this music metaphor which works well for songs, but not at all for videos. Had Apple integrated this into Quicktime or something else, it may have been much better.<p>More importantly, it sucks for <i>playing</i> videos. With other video players, I can full screen and not have my other screens go black. Can't do it on iTunes. Again, I believe this is a function of being a jack of all trades and a master of none.<p>* Preferences for EVERYTHING. There's all sorts of different preferences and options in iTunes and they're confusing because you're actually managing 7 programs, not 1. And even still, some prefs are left out (like the movie ones for example) because then it would be even more overwhelming.<p>I don't even want to get into the fact that iTunes even talks to xcode (!!!!) to do all the iPhone SDK stuff and all the headaches that brings.<p>Let's not kid ourselves, adding all this stuff into iTunes was not some sort of ""design decision"". Apple got iTunes onto enough computers, so now if they want them to see new Apple stuff they are going to put it in iTunes. Logical enough from a business perspective, but it sucks from a program perspective.",1252562303

814748,comment,814161,814347,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"Although I basically agree with you I miss your certainty. I can think of one scenario which would prevent computers from gaining consciousness even if we are just machines. The basic premise of computer to get conscious is that consciousness is either created within our brains or that it has no intention itself without our brains and will therefore not differentiate between human brains and computer brains.<p>But that is not necessarily a given. Our brains are very good at reflecting our environment. So maybe consciousness is not something our brain did come up with but just something it reflects from the inputs it gets. Same as your brain doesn't have to be blue to see blue, but only creates a representation of the color which is outside. So there could be a bigger consciousness in our environment and all we have is an internal reflection of that created by the inputs we receive. But now that larger consciousness might not be without intend - it might simply refuse to show itself to computers so they wouldn't reflect it even if they would have the basic ability to do so. I know this sound rather esoteric and I don't really belief it myself, but something that seems to work like that is supported by so many reports of personal experiences that I wouldn't yet completely disregard the possibility.<p>So computer consciousness will probably be possible, but could fail if consciousness itself turns out to be something with an own agenda.",1252562153

814741,comment,814575,814575,0,0,iigs,,,"<i>Any hacks to take off the cap on broadcast strength on an easily available router?</i><p>Yes, with certain firmwares you can. This adjustment is like turning up your stereo: it might get a bit ""louder"" but beyond a certain point it begins to clip and distort. The big difference is that unlike a stereo, the default radio gain is usually set fairly high -- there's rarely much more headroom to get.<p>A radio tuned for 100mw might have 200mw in it, if you're lucky. While this sounds like a lot, it's only 3db, which is a small fraction of any signal meter ""bar"" reading.<p>If you really want to increase your effective transmission power, your best bet is a high-gain antenna:<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/client-antennas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/client-antennas</a> (no affiliation)<p>These will increase your effective signal strength by focusing the beam of the antenna in the direction you wish to transmit/receive it. The down side is that the antennas have to be pointed at each other, and the higher the gain the closer they have to be aligned.<p>However, please keep in mind that increasing your effective radiation in one direction above the initial design limit is likely to run afoul of your government's (the FCC in the USA) rules about RF emissions.<p>In summary, yes you can do it, but it will take expensive, fidgety antennas, is probably illegal, and at the end of it you still might not get the amount of gain you need. I recognize your desire to use wireless but generally IMO it's not worth the work.",1252561783

Especially when the company has an application process for indie artists that is not required of major label artists.  And most of them get rejected.  The bottom line, is that via Itunes, the playing field is not level, as it is with sites like Digg and YouTube.  I guarantee you that Johnny Random Band is not getting as many downloads and sales per track as Maroon 5 or Daughtry.  Next time you see an indie artist who's on Itunes, see if they are wheeling the same Aston Martin DB9 that Kanye has been spotted in these days.

My question to you then was what you'd do if you started with 4 versions then proved that one was bad.  Your response was to start over.<p>If you instead keep a table of which people are in which version, progressively removing versions while not throwing away existing data is easy to do.  This also allows you to set up tests where A and B get unequal splits of the data.  The drawback is that you need a new table that grows fast and is heavily accessed.

814731,comment,814161,814161,0,0,lux,,,"No one's mentioned On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins yet... I'm surprised. Check it out here:<p><a href=""http://www.onintelligence.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onintelligence.org/</a><p>Great read on exactly this topic, and one of the more plausible paths to actually achieving machine intelligence. But it's not through the typical path followed by most AI research up until recently. He argues you need to look at how the neocortex actually works, how it communicates with the senses, stores data and learns patterns, in order to create anything artificial that displays intelligence. I'm inclined to agree.<p>Our brains may seem to map to computer-like functions reasonably well (short & long-term memory, processing, input/output, etc), but there are key differences. Hawkins argues that it's all based on input and learning to recognize patterns within that input. A few interesting points I remember:<p>- More feedback goes back to the senses and/or higher levels of the cortex than data is sent in. This seems to imply that the lower levels are recognizing larger patterns and sending feedback to help correct or verify against higher levels.<p>- There's no difference between input from the ear, eye or hand. It's all just patterns at the cortex level. In fact, the output is the same as the input. The feedback process actually helps learn how to utilize our body, and as an extension of that, tools.<p>- A key element to the patterns in the real world is time. Everything occurs over time, so the patterns almost come into the cortex as a sort of melody it interprets.<p>- Memory is imperfect, because we don't need it to be in order to learn. We remember things and draw our conscious attention to them when they don't fit the pattern we're expecting. At that point, we're attuned to learn a new pattern or determine how to react to a missed pattern.<p>These are very different from the components we use in computers, and how we use them. The cortex is almost like a universal biological learning machine. Differences in intelligence between mammals can be attributed to the size of the cortex, e.g., the amount of processing available.

And we're piloting the world's first human-consensus forecasting system.  Check us out at: http://stormpulse.com.<p>We're building Stormpulse to reduce the costs of severe weather, which effects millions worldwide.<p>Our weather maps have regularly appeared on CNN and are displayed on 750+ websites, from media sites such as USA Today and ThomsonReuters to intranets at places like Boeing and the Mayo Clinic.  Since August 2008, our site has been visited over 18 million times, with over 60% of those visits coming direct.  Hundreds of thousands of those visits are from decision-makers at Fortune 100 companies in the energy, defense, and transportation industries.<p>Before Stormpulse, Brad and I wrote software that automated the presentation of rich catalog content for a distributor of over 400,000 products.<p>We're making money and are ready to fuel the growth of Stormpulse with funding from smart, qualified, passionate investors.

At the very least it is so similar to ""creativity"" that any discussion on the topic would probably quickly degrade to boring semantic argument.<p>From this I think there are two potentially interesting products:<p>- Evolution by natural selection may be usable as an engine of machine consciousness. Some variant of evolution may be at the core of our own consciousness.<p>- Evolution by natural selection is a mechanical process that we can ""take apart"" and understand relatively easily. It also happens to be the engine of the process that created species. <i>Happens to be</i>. Even if the evolution of species had never happened, evolution would still exist in abstract. This put it in very good position to be discovered. Perhaps there are equally powerful concepts waiting to be discovered. Perhaps one of them is at the core of our own creativity.

You can replace my exaples with their open source equivalents (LibreOffice, Gimp, etc) and the argument still stands.<p>A uni should teach algorithms and data structures, networking, threading, etc, not how to use firefox.<p>Likewise, a uni should teach operating systems, threads, hardware, compilers, memory management, etc, but not Linux.<p>Even programming languages are generally not taught as ends in an of themselves. Good schools expect you to pick them up as part of the class. For example, the course is about data structures, but you will code in Java, C, and LISP during the semester, and you are expected to pick them up. They may help you a bit in learning them, and give you background on them when you move to a part of the course that switches to a new lang.",1392998054

Virtual assets do not physically exist and therefore it is the ability to represent these assets within multiple computers across the network which give bitcoin its decentralized nature. These virtual assets also have to have real world value to everyone, without value, there exists no economic incentive (block rewards and transaction fees) for securing the network through computation.&quot;<p>This analysis of Bitcoin as the &quot;internet of money/finance&quot; is kind of reminiscent of the &quot;internet of things&quot; movement, that, according to inept marketing departments, is guaranteed to revolutionize our lives in short order.<p>Do we have the need/infrastructure in place for an &quot;internet of money&quot; or an &quot;internet of things&quot; to emerge?

I didn&#x27;t have much of that encouragement in my early life, which was filled with basically the opposite ... adults (esp in my school) chumming up to the cool kids and publicly humiliating the tentative ones. Bill&#x27;s character in the movie, and how he played it on screen, still today serve as a role model for how I try to deal with other people. For me personally, connecting with and supporting the more fragile people around me still is way more appealing, fulfilling, and meaningful for me than just constantly trying to prop up my own status by latching on to the cool, popular crowd.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079540/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079540/</a>",1392997464

The more information they have on a given person, the more information they have period, the more valuable they are. This value is to advertisers and marketers of course (the real &quot;customers&quot;) but also to end users. WhatsApp is $19 billion worth of data about people in places where Facebook doesn&#x27;t have a lot of data. Countries like India, for example. I don&#x27;t think Facebook penetration is nearly as significant there as it is in the US (though I do not have a statistic on hand for that ATM).<p>So the argument is that WhatsApp gives Facebook a foot in the door to more information on more places at once. Just like Google gets data on what people want from their videos from YouTube, Instagram gives Facebook more information on what people do with their images and how they share them. Facebook already does these things - messaging and image sharing - but it could be argued that Facebook will be able to do them better/more profitably/at least in a more aware way if it studies how it works for Instagram and WhatsApp.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t really see the point myself - but that&#x27;s an argument that could be made.",1392997314

If we can just figure out this one general-purpose algorithm, programs may be able to learn general-purpose things.<p>As I wrote a few days ago here:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7217967"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7217967</a><p>&quot;The way intelligence works, in my opinion, is this:<p>1) experiences are stored in the brain. Experiences contain inputs from the 5 senses as well as the sense of danger/satisfaction at that point.<p>2) at each given moment, the brain takes the current input and matches it against the stored experiences. If there is a match (up to a threshold), then the sense of danger/satisfaction is recalled. Thus the entity is able to &#x27;predict&#x27;, up to a specific point, if the outcome of the current situation is bad or good for it, and react accordingly.<p>The key thing to the above is that the whole process is fused together: the steps for adding new experiences, matching new experiences and recalling reactions is fused together in big pile of neurons.&quot;",1392997043

My observations here are generally about situations where you&#x27;re working for someone else (although some have general relevance). For business owners and founders, motivations and rewards are very different, and I think that, for them, the decision to work long hours or not is a far more subjective and personal one.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything intrinsically bad about working long hours, <i>as long as it is the exception (and for relatively short periods of time), rather than the rule.</i> For example, if you&#x27;re working for a startup and you&#x27;ve got a big product launch coming up, it makes absolute sense to put in extra effort in the run-up to the deadline to add new functionality, eradicate bugs, etc. However, if you are expected to put in 60-hour weeks as a matter of course, that&#x27;s not good. Work-Life balance is important (and gets more important as you get older).<p>If you are expected to put in 60-hour weeks as a matter of course and your boss <i>doesn&#x27;t</i>, I would advise you to quit that job as quickly as it is feasible to do so.<p>Working long hours wears you down, especially in roles where high concentration is required. I used to work 12-hour days as a trader and, come the weekend, I&#x27;d be so exhausted that I&#x27;d usually sleep in on Saturday and Sunday until the early afternoon. That&#x27;s not a good lifestyle.<p>I also believe that working long hours has a negative impact on creativity and the ability to make intuitive leaps. In my experience, taking a break and stepping back from a difficult problem can often yield a solution. If your work hours do not allow your brain enough downtime from work to disengage from your work problems and engage other things (beyond simply resting), your productivity is likely to take a significant hit, in my opinion.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the impact on your mood. If you&#x27;re not actually enjoying working long hours, it&#x27;s likely to make you impatient and irritable, and that will have a knock-on effect on the atmosphere at work.<p>Certain types of companies (law firms and investment banks, for example) seem to rely heavily on getting more junior people to work long hours. They&#x27;re able to do that because the rewards that come with climbing the corporate ladder are significant - partners and managing directors get paid a <i>lot</i> of money and, in order to have a chance of getting promoted to that level, you have to serve your time and put in long hours. For many young (and, some might say, foolish) people, the long-term carrot (Ferrari-level income) outweighs the downside of having practically no life during one&#x27;s 20s. Because of that, I think their decision is closer in nature to a business owner&#x27;s or startup founder&#x27;s than a pure employee&#x27;s.<p>Bottom line (and TL;DR): It&#x27;s up to each individual to make their own decision based on their motivations and personal circumstances.",1392996052

This will hold you accountable and let people know what you’re working on.<p>For a long time I wrote off the idea of having a blog because it seemed vain. I don&#x27;t usually have any great ideas that anyone else needs to know about, and my trials of learning new things are just the same as everyone else&#x27;s. However, over the past few months I&#x27;ve realized that I was dead wrong. Watching a few good series of blogs like [1] and [2] has shown me that even if you don&#x27;t have anything world shattering it is still great as a means to make learning more important. After all, you can&#x27;t let down your readers, can you?<p>[1] <a href=""http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/09/26/hacker-school-day-4-c-unit-testing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/09/26/hacker-school-day-4-c-unit-te...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.jeffknupp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jeffknupp.com/</a>",1392995483

E.g., from the OP: &quot;So by taxing the wealthy and spending it on services, we can better ensure that the level playing field you allude to continues to exist.&quot; (In case it isn&#x27;t clear from that quotation, the &quot;level playing field&quot; isn&#x27;t about equalizing wealth or income, it&#x27;s about providing public services to everyone.)<p>> equating wealth and evil<p>Who&#x27;s doing that? Here&#x27;s the OP again: &quot;No one believes that there should not be rich people.&quot; &quot;No one wants to take the money you have away.&quot; You may think the OP is insincere, but he is very plainly not equating wealth and evil. I don&#x27;t see <i>anyone</i> here equating wealth and evil, implicitly or explicitly. I&#x27;m afraid I think you&#x27;re just imagining it.<p>Here are arguments I see actually being made by people in this discussion advocating more tax. I have italicized the only one of these arguments that is on the same continent as the ballpark of &quot;equating wealth and evil&quot;, and it&#x27;s still a fair way away. Governments can allocate capital more effectively than most billionaires. Taxation may incentivize wealthy people to invest more. Taxes are low right now compared with what they have historically been, so raising them might be a good idea. Inequality itself causes social problems. <i>No single person can really be so much more productive than others as to justify billions in wealth; so if someone is that wealthy, they got that way on account of others&#x27; work, so they don&#x27;t deserve it.</i> Economists are saying we need to reduce inequality to avoid disaster.<p>> Will it be ok if wealth from developed nations were transferred to poor nations, every year?<p>Yes, that would probably be a good thing. Is it supposed to be obviously not? Most developed nations <i>do</i> in fact transfer some of their wealth to poor nations every year. So do citizens of those developed nations. We call the first of those &quot;aid&quot; and the second &quot;charity&quot; and while it&#x27;s possible to argue about how effective they are it&#x27;s certainly not obvious that they&#x27;re a bad idea.",1452275984

The public/private disctinction would work the way I imagined it, but only because I was assuming a limited form of source address filtering: essentially one bit on every interface (including VPNs) for &quot;is this local&quot; (I also assume separate addresses per interface).  The second address is so that so wildcard listening only listens on local addresses, and explicit public addresses need to be specified (or otherwise enabled) by the user before a server will listen on it.  I didn&#x27;t realize that just doing source address filtering as you suggest could accomplish the same thing with one address in a much simpler way.",1452275942

10866769,comment,10864176,10866589,0,0,dsacco,,,"<i>It has more than 2M lines of C code. Almost all libraries were written from scratch.</i><p>Every professional security researcher reading this just raised an eyebrow and thought to themselves, &quot;That&#x27;s a vulnerable application.&quot; In fact, your team (or a similar one at AOL) <i>did</i> introduce vulnerabilities[1][2]. If we assume that, as you imply, AOL really was exclusively composed of above average C developers writing high quality code, this should really just demonstrate the point for us.<p>I&#x27;m sure your team wrote high quality C code (or at the very least, <i>tried very hard</i> to write high quality C code), and as someone who likes C I also dislike the meme that C should simply not be written, no exceptions. I&#x27;d probably change it to, &quot;Don&#x27;t write C unless you need extreme performance, have great engineering resources and you&#x27;ll generate unmitigated financial returns such to make any reasonable business risk assessment moot.&quot; That means virtually the same thing for anyone reading it, but it sounds a lot less sexy and memorable as far as programming aphorisms go.<p>I have never professionally audited a C project and not found a vulnerability. Most of my friends in this industry would likely say the same. I&#x27;ve never seen a serious audit of a &quot;large&quot; (100kloc or more) C project by a serious, reputable firm with no vulnerabilities reported. If you wrote 2 million lines of C code, if you wrote libraries from <i>scratch</i>, you have serious vulnerabilities. Otherwise, your engineering practices and resources exceed NASA&#x27;s in formal verification and correctness.<p>I believe it is theoretically possible to write 100% safe C code, for some approximation of that ideal that leaves aside the ivory tower definition (&quot;the only safe machine is the one which is off&quot;). But I also believe this is so expensive and resource intensive (secure coding standards, audits, attempts at formal verification and provable correctness) that it&#x27;s just generally not realistic in practice.<p>The reason I am saying all of this is not to attack you or your sense of worth as a C developer. Rather, I&#x27;d like you to consider that you simply <i>have no idea</i> how many vulnerabilities exist in ICQ. In fact, I found eight different security reports for ICQ, linked at the bottom. One of the more serious ones allowed arbitrary email retrieval, which I&#x27;m willing to bet was introduced because your team liked to develop in-house libraries and decided to do that for POP3.<p>C is a language which is both very powerful and which requires constant vigilance while coding. It is a language which makes pushing a buffer overflow to production on a Friday at 3 pm <i>very easy.</i> I bet your team was comparatively well-versed in C vulnerabilities for the time, but the very fact that you rolled libraries from scratch tells me you already have a high probability of errors showing up. Rolling a library/framework in-house is basically the first thing security researchers look for in an audit, because the third party ones are (usually) more secure due to their exposure. When you further consider the probability of third party software you did use becoming vulnerable in the future, changing compiler optimizations introducing new vulnerabilities and the sheer size of the SEI CERT Secure Coding Standard itself, you are left with a very dangerous risk profile.<p>We cannot expect C to be a safe language for general use if you need to have the rigor of one of the best research organizations in the world coupled with the top 0.01% of all C programmers. It just isn&#x27;t feasible.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.coresecurity.com/content/bevy-of-new-icq-vulnerabilities-surface"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coresecurity.com/content/bevy-of-new-icq-vulnerab...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-123/product_id-9167/AOL-ICQ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-123/...</a>",1452275921

The app shows users the professional profiles of nearby people. It is designed to be primarily used at events, to help people forge new professional relations, by helping them choose the best chat partner available. Think of it as ultra-local LinkedIn or digital name tags.<p>There are 3 things that set Nowy Connect apart from other people-discovery apps: proximity, real-time, better privacy. First, proximity. The app focuses on the people who are up to 30 meters away from you. People a mile away do not appear. Second, real-time. The app shows you people who are right there, right now. Not people who were where you are half an hour ago. Third, better privacy. The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy to figure out who is nearby, not GPS or users&#x27; checkins - this means they are more accurate w.r.t. who is nearby, protects better users&#x27; privacy, and has lower battery consumption.<p>The app uses IBM Watson to make it even easier for people to find out interesting people to talk to. You just tell it who you’d like to meet, for example, “I’d like to meet mobile application developers,” and Nowy Connect will notify you when someone matching your description is nearby.

Most of the non-trivial properties people <i>do</i> care about can be used to tell you if a program is going to halt in a finite amount of time.  Want an upper bound on memory?  This program doesn&#x27;t have one?  Well, then it never halts.  It has one?  Well, then we know it halts or loops within 2^bits steps - run it for that many steps and you know which.<p>I think non-Turing-complete will prove interesting because our programs are currently <i>described</i> in Turing complete languages, but run in more constrained contexts anyway.  A program that always halts after running for 2^100 steps is not Turing complete.  A program that halts if it tries to use more than 2^100 bytes of memory is not Turing complete.  Applying these constraints in this way doesn&#x27;t help us with analysis much, but it hints that we can probably find other ways to constrain our programs which won&#x27;t get in the way of what we&#x27;re trying to accomplish, and it&#x27;s quite possible that some of those will let us build languages more amenable to analysis (and further possible that the gains in analysis will make up for a limited amount of getting-in-the-way).",1452274350

I believed this by default as well before actually reading up on the topic. Let&#x27;s start with the data we have:\n1. From bones, we know that the average height decreased as people started farming. Bones became more fragile, teeth less healthy etc. This was probably caused by a worse diet and more disease.\n2. By studying hunter gatheres in today&#x27;s Africa, we know they spend less than 5 hours a day hunting and gathering. They spend much more time than us relaxing and socializing.\n3. From bones we know that hunter gatherers very rarely showed signs of violent deaths (counter to the stereotype).<p>I&#x27;m sure there is conflicting research about this, but it&#x27;s clearly not as cut and dry as you make it seem.<p>So if life in paleolithic times was actually pretty decent, why did people start doing agriculture you might ask? Because hunter gatherers would inevitably be conquered by those who did, because farming can support more people, leave a surplus than can feed armies, and give the opportunity to invent new technology. Hunting and gathering never produces such a surplus, and wild resources are only enough for smaller tribes.<p>That&#x27;s not to say we&#x27;d be better off living like hunter gatherers today, but we should probably keep an open mind.

The exotic stuff, integration strategy, and implementation are new territory that exposes a level of risk a tried-and-true method (eg knock-off Oberon) doesn&#x27;t have. It&#x27;s new and unfamiliar territory to programmers at large even if some methods were seen in academia (eg Cyclone). It must be shown to be effective in terms of daily usage, standard libraries, and tooling because it&#x27;s such new and unfamiliar territory.<p>When it is, as I have confidence in the team(s), it will then have a different argument where it eliminates way more risks than it introduces.

The (define ...) in Scheme that you can put anywhere makes me cringe; you have to walk the code to expand that into proper lambdas before you can analyze it. Other Lisp programmers don&#x27;t agree with me. The CLISP implementation of Common Lisp, whose core internals are written in C and which historically predates C90, let alone C99, uses a &quot;declarations anywhere&quot; style on top of ANSI C. This is achieved with a text-to-text preprocessor called &quot;varbrace&quot; which basically adds the above braces in all the right places.<p>You get better locality with explicit binding blocks, because their scope can end sooner:<p><pre><code>   {\n     foo *ptr = whatever();\n     /* this is a little capsule of code */\n     /* scope of ptr ends */\n   }\n\n   {\n     foo *ptr = whatever_else(); /* different ptr */\n     /* this is another little capsule of code */\n   }\n</code></pre>\nThese tighter scopes are much more tidy than the somewhat scatter-brained &quot;from here to the end of the function&quot; approach.<p>I can look at that capsule and know that <i>that</i> ptr is meaningful just within those seven lines of code.

First: there are incentives in place to encourage them to do it. If they buy useless things or spend too much money, someone may notice and they may lose their job. If they find a particularly good bargain, they may be rewarded. Second: most people are not perfectly selfish utility-maximizing <i>homo economicus</i>, and even when spending &quot;somebody else&#x27;s money on somebody else&quot; they do in fact prefer to do so in a way that benefits the second somebody-else at not too much cost to the first one.<p>Guess what?

The semantic analysis ends when a translation unit is analyzed. All that is left is to resolve the external references when multiple units are linked; nothing is re-translated. This is very clearly stated in a few sentences in that section of the standard which describes the translation phases one by one.<p>Link-time optimization is a language extension which alters the concept of a translation unit. In some ways, multiple translation units become one unit (such as: they inline each other&#x27;s code, or code in one is altered based on the behavior of code in the other). But in other ways they aren&#x27;t one translation unit (e.g. their file scope static names are still mutually invisible.)<p>One reason I don&#x27;t use C99 is that many of its features aren&#x27;t C++ compatible. Most of C90 is. With just a little effort, a C90 program compiles as C++ and behaves the same way, and no significant features of C90 have to be wholly excluded from use.<p>Portability to C++ increases the exposure of the program to more compilers, with better safety and better diagnostics.<p>In some cases, I can use constructs that are specially targetted to C or C++ via macros. Instead of a C cast, I can have convert(type, val) macro which uses the C++ static_cast when compiled as C++, a coerce(type, val) which uses reinterpret_cast, or strip_qual(type, val) which uses const_cast. I get the diagnostics under C++, but the code still targets C. I&#x27;m also prevented from converting from void * without a cast, and there are other benefits like detecting duplicate external object names.<p>This way of programming in C and C++ was dubbed &quot;Clean C&quot; by the Harbison and Steele reference manual.<p>C90 is a cleaner, smaller language than C99 without extraneous &quot;garbage features&quot; like variable-length arrays that allocate arbitrary amounts of storage on the stack without any way to indicate failure to do so.<p>The useful library extensions in C99 like snprintf or newer math functions can be used from C90; you can detect them in a configure script like any library.<p>The overall main reason is that I simply don&#x27;t have faith in the ISO C process. The last good standard that was put out was C90. After that, I don&#x27;t agree with the direction it has been taking. Not <i>all</i> of it is bad, but we should go back to C90 and start a better fork, with better people.<p><pre><code>   git checkout -b c90-fork c90\n   git cherry-pick ... what is good from c99-branch</code></pre>",1452273125

I taught a ten week course in back end development and I think the students would have done equally well deploying on a VPS or Heroku.<p>The curriculum called for using Heroku but I regret following it now. Heroku bills itself as being easy for a beginner but go ahead and try to deploy any simple Rails or Node project using their guides. Half the time something goes wrong. Either you need extra dependencies or you have to do extra configuration that the setup instructions didn&#x27;t mention. In the end you have to look up how to check the logs and even if you get that far a beginner has no clue what those logs are really saying. Even as an experienced senior developer, I couldn&#x27;t get the demo project I was showing them deployed without a ton of hassle and 4 attempts.<p>So while it may seem like a VPS has a lot more moving parts, it&#x27;s a better deal overall. Same level of confusion and complexity for students but in the end they at least know a bit about how a server works (which Heroku hides) and it&#x27;s way cheaper even with SSL.

Couple of reasons 1st is that I’d actually like to look at my financials from a 3 statement perspective on an accrual basis. For example\nI often find myself buying plane tickets for the next few months all at once – mint/quicken would look at this and say you just went way over budget for travel, but I’d rather book those as assets on my personal balance sheet, see the hit to my cash flow statement, and recognize the expense in the months that I travel. Also, given that I have considerable business expenses that I run through my personal accounts that I get reimbursed for, reconciling those items can be pretty annoying if can’t make manual journal entries.\nFor the record Wave accounting is the closest thing that I‘ve found, but would prefer something that runs locally.\nRequirements:<p>1. has a true GUI (so no ledger/hledger)<p>2. Runs on either windows or os x (would consider cloud based, but prefer not)<p>3. You can run reports (i.e. Income statement for x period, or payments in this category or vendor)<p>4.

I believe that <i>a large part of</i> the future will be languages that are not Turing-complete, for applications where that&#x27;s appropriate (e.g., C compilers) but not where it&#x27;s not (e.g., interpreters). I also don&#x27;t think that &quot;well, that&#x27;s how we&#x27;ve always done it&quot; is a particularly compelling argument given how young the field of programming languages is.<p>For instance, another wonderful example of requiring code to cooperate with the proof process is Google&#x27;s Native Client. NaCl doesn&#x27;t care about halting; what it cares about is that the code in question only accesses its own memory, or makes specific pre-defined calls into the supervising code. You can do this with hardware support (and they did, with segmentation, where available), but you can also do this with software support.<p>The NaCl technique is straightforward. You&#x27;re required to lay out your assembly so that every 32-byte alignment boundary separates instructions; you must insert NOPs as necessary. Any fixed read, write, or jump must be within an address within a mask (or to a predefined address in privileged code), and any computed read, write, or jump must be immediately preceded, within the same 32-byte block, by a mask operation on the relevant register. For data, the mask enforces that only data is accessed; for jumps, the mask enforces that the jump target is within the code area and also 32-byte aligned.<p>Now you&#x27;ve proven a fairly complicated property of the code, that control flow never escapes to privileged code except at well-defined entry points. Doing so on arbitrary x86 would be impossible (unless you resort to binary translation), but this is a very minor modification to arbitrary x86, and a regular C compiler can be easily modified to emit it. The resulting restricted variant of x86 remains Turing-complete.<p>And it is entirely reasonable for the NaCl verifier to say &quot;Uh, what are you doing, please try again&quot; if presented with code that is technically non-malicious but does not follow the rules. The NaCl verifier doesn&#x27;t claim to detect malicious code (that&#x27;s the antivirus problem, and unsolvable). It claims to take code that makes a specific promise about not being malicious, and verifies that property.",1452272465

Yes T-Mobile is throttling and yes they&#x27;re trying to relabel what they&#x27;re doing to avoid all of the negative connotations that the term &quot;throttling&quot; brings wit it, but what are they doing that&#x27;s harmful to the customer?  I think it ultimately comes down to the fact that T-Mobile made it an opt-out feature instead of an opt-in one.<p>The reality is that wireless bandwidth is constrained and sustained transfers at high rates degrade the overall experience of everyone using a particular cellular tower. T-Mobile, being particularly bandwidth constrained, is attempting to mitigate this issue.  They&#x27;re doing it by offering a service where if you allow your bandwidth for certain content types to be be throttled, then the bandwidth you use for certain qualifying services won&#x27;t count against your data cap.  They&#x27;re offering a carrot, not threatening with a stick.<p>Yes it&#x27;s opt-out, but that was probably done intentionally because most folks won&#x27;t notice the degradation or won&#x27;t care, <i>AND</i>, more importantly, most people wouldn&#x27;t bother to enable it if it were opt-in.  If T-Mobile made it opt-in then their adoption rate would be lower so by making opt-out they&#x27;re getting the greatest benefit.<p>I just looked at my account and the toggle to turn Binge On off is easily accessible in my user profile.  It&#x27;s not a buried feature anywhere.  The only possible gripe I could see is that the setting is granular and per-line making it marginally harder to disable, but that&#x27;s also a benefit. I have multiple lines on my account but only 1 has unlimited data, so the ability to disable it for just that one line is nice and allows me to have my cake and eat it too.",1452272429

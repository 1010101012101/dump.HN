Sure you can script client-side to explicitly manage divs etc. To do it right, every single subcomponent needs to become scripted. How about some style clues to the rendering engine: hide-until-complete, place-holder-strategy, link-disabled-until-visible etc.",1256306373

It would be misogynistic if its point was that all girls are awful; what it <i>is</i> saying is that it's like that stereotypical girlfriend situation where she's cleaned up but is still a quote-unquote crazy bitch. Calling a girl a crazy bitch is misogynistic in the same way that a girl calling a guy a dick is misandric.

I kept my computer running for a week straight, no sleep, and had iTunes shuffle to a new song once every 10 seconds, and for each song scrobble to Last.fm and also download album art and lyrics. At some point it borked out.<p>I know Windows gets a bad rep for crashing—I use XP on my Macbook and I've had no crashes yet—but beyond crashing, I'm astonished at how grotesquely unstable it is. I use an app on it that takes up the full screen, where one window generates the full screen window, so Alt-F4 doesn't work, and I can't open a task manager because it just gets auto-hidden by the screen. That's incredibly bad practice, but I've seen it done by multiple Windows designers because it, unlike OS X, doesn't offer a rigid set of guidelines for its functions.<p>Beyond crashing and messing up, Windows is just incredibly un-smooth. Perhaps they fixed it with 7, I don't know yet, but when I use XP or Vista I'm struck by how hard it is for me to treat its window metaphor with any respect. I can't rely on windows to move when I click and drag them, they don't have any particularly good window hierarchy in place, and everything is so choppy and clunky, even with a good mouse, that I find myself resenting the system. That compared to OS X, which is the smoothest system I've ever used. Everything in it adds up brilliantly.<p>I still like XP—or, I do until there are more Mac emulators available—but I completely get axod's argument, and agree with it. Microsoft killed computers' reputation, and are primarily responsible for why people I know think computers are so impossible to deal with.",1256306069

898673,comment,897873,898162,0,0,elblanco,,,"I got downvoted, but I was serious. A major reason that Windows users don't switch to Macs is the cost. <i>Everything</i> in the Mac ecosystem costs more. The mice, the monitors, the software.<p>Case in point: Windows XP was released in 2001. Users didn't have to pay a dime to go through three fairly major updates to the software (SP1, SP2 and SP3) and many many <i>many</i> minor updates. Each one making the OS better, faster, more stable, more secure, etc.<p>That's 7 years of support for the initial purchase price, which was probably for most people either hidden in the cost of the machine as an OEM price,(AND the hardware was likely 20-40% lower than the cost of a similarly equipped Mac) or an upgrade from Windows 98, which probably ran around $50.<p>So 10 years of fairly major operating system updates cost < $150 depending.<p>rimantas said ""and upgrade from 10.5 ""Leopard"" to 10.6 ""Snow Leopard"" is only $29.""<p>But in Microsoft land, the update from 10.5 -> 10.6 would have been $0 considering how minor the differences are between the two versions.<p>This is really the great divide that Apple fans simply don't understand. If I have to pay $25 for a text editor (WriteRoom) on a Mac, or $0 for a choice of thousands of similar tools on a PC. I'll choose $0.<p>If I have to pay $70 for a mouse on a Mac, or $10 for a mouse on a PC, I'll choose $10.<p>The thread above is about ways to entice Windows users to Macs. The thrust was, ""if Apple just stuck a VM out there with Snow Leopard on it for Windows users to bang on, they would loose their minds and run out and buy an entire office full of Apple stuff"".<p>My response is, ""no they won't"". Modern Windows OSs are actually pretty nice places to be(even Vista to a point), the delta between OSX 10.6 and Windows 7 is not as great as say 10.1 and Windows XP used to be. Thus ""getting hands on"" will not be the same kind of enticement as it used to be. If Apple seriously wants to pull over more Windows users and grow their user base, they have to adjust their pricing model.<p>That's unlikely to happen though because:
a) Seriously, Apple won't take over the computing world anytime soon even if their hardware was $0, there is too much momentum.
b) Apple is wildly profitable with a smaller userbase. All they have to do is maintain the userbase and if they can grow it a few percent a year without adjusting pricing, fantastic.
c) The Apple software/hardware ecosystem <i>still</i> doesn't have the depth and breadth of the equivalent Windows one. Lots of people have lots of things they need to do that they can't on a Mac. Many times there simply isn't ""an app for that"".<p>The current response is ""well just install Parallels"". Which is again, another fantastic demonstration of pricing insensitivity. So for the average Windows user to switch 100% to a Mac, they have to
a) Buy new hardware with a 20-40% markup over similarly equipped PC hardware
b) Buy new software, in many cases old freeware software many people get by with on the PCs simply isn't available at $0, and instead we end up with $25 text editors as replacements.
c) Buy parallels at $xxx dollars
d) Buy the Windows OS again<p>So to switch to a Mac and achieve equivalent levels of functionality I'm already well over the $499 for an average level PC + the cost of my Office 2007 variant to get up to speed.<p>And it's not really clear that the buy-in price really bought anything special or new to the end-user.<p><i>edit</i><p>Here's a perfect example

898657,comment,898627,898627,0,0,stuntmouse2,,,"MIRROR (site appears to be down):<p>I believe I have got the first Scheme application past Apple review into the iTunes App Store. It is yet another Reversi clone, called Reverso. It is a combination of 90% Scheme and 10% Objective-C, written with Gambit-C Scheme. James Long has already shown how to compile Gambit-C for the iPhone, and I started from there. My Scheme code is compiled to C by Gambit and later by GCC to produce native ARM code, bundled in a static library, which is ok with the iPhone SDK license agreement. The Objective-C then calls the library as a pure C library. The Scheme code deals with position evaluation, alpha-beta pruning, transposition tables, move legality, different strategies and so on. The Objective-C code deals with sound, animations, GUI, user preferences, basically everything that calls the iPhone OS API. Reversi was chosen because I like strategy games and it is much more algorithmic than artistic, and I am no artist.<p>The performance of the code is excellent. I used some Gambit-specific declarations, only fixnum arithmetic, pre-allocated a large heap, and called the garbage-collector every time the user needed to think. The search is not memory intensive, but the transposition tables are. I did not write a specific hash function but relied on Gambit-C’s table type. The boards used during search were retrieved from a pool (the newest Gambit-C has made subu8vector-move! a public API), so they did not put pressure on the garbage-collector. In the end it was a very successful experiment. Developing with Scheme is orders of magnitude more productive than with most other languages. Gambit-C is also one of the best Scheme compilers out there, and made my job a lot easier.",1256302856

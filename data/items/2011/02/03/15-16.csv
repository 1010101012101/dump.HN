2175161,comment,2174538,2174538,0,0,jerf,,,"Many people here are answering the question of why RDF sucks, but that was not the question asked. The question is why this suckage has still not managed to bury the technology.<p>There is a very frequent problem people suffer from, which is mistaking <i>goals</i> for results. When you start looking for it, you'll see it a lot. A new open source NoSQL database will pop up, post a long list of goals (""Fastest performance, maintain some integrity, transactions, trivial sharding, consistent available <i>and</i> partition tolerant, and able to run on a TI-83 at web scale!""), put up a benchmark that shows that if you have no features and have no code written to ensure you don't fall down under real load you can put up <i>way</i> bigger numbers than the products with features, and suddenly you have some set of very excited people. Why are they excited? It's not the code; the code is worthless, the <i>only</i> thing it can do is run that benchmark. It's the promises.<p>You can see it in graphical programming. Graphical programming has a few modest successes, but the <i>promises</i> are about changing how everybody programs and how even Granny will be able to program. The fact that it has never happened despite immense effort for tons of smart people doesn't stop a certain segment of people from still being True Believers.<p>And, today, we talk about RDF. It promises to organize the web, it promises glorious wonderful search engines, it promises the world. It can't deliver, because merely sticking URIs on some graph nodes is only the beginning of the solution, not even remotely the end, you still have issues of agreement and accuracy and all kinds of other things. But the promise is <i>so beguiling</i> that some people just can't give it up, if we just try harder it'll happen, it's just that nobody has done it right yet, I'm smart enough to see what the previous hundreds of smart people haven't and I'll get it right, oh, it'll be <i>glorious</i> when everybody gets their heads out of their ass and listen to me and just start doing it <i>right</i>.<p>But RDF can't get us there. It's so general it's nothing at all.<p>There are all kinds of places where people become excessively bedazzled by promises and never notice the concrete reality before them. Another interesting example is Object Orientation. This has proved useful, IMHO, if not the be-all end-all of development methodologies, but it is interesting to contrast the <i>promises</i> made by OO back in, say, the late 1980s, with OO reality today. The promises were about how objects can represent things in the real world and you can model the real world with them. This turned out to be bunk. The real world has some place in OO but only carefully layered and wrapped and mixed in with a lot of other not-real-world things, iterators and factoryfactories and facades and data structs and ORMs and so on. The old promises were interesting and wrong, but also so beguiling that even today you will still hear this nonsense spouted about how this is the purpose of OO, even though it is now well understood that writing your programs with an excessively-strong tie to physical reality is asking for problems. Even as the reality is actually useful the old beguiling promises are still around screwing young developers up to this day.<p>(It is a tricky balance maintaining the proper level of skepticism because conditions change and sometimes wild promises become practical, and sometimes someone really does manage to pull off one of these things. The latest example would be the commercial success of the iPad, because for a long time smart money was on there being no market for tablets after numerous and repeated failures in creating the market. But in general, ""show me the code"" or appropriate manifestation is still the best way to avoid being trapped in one of these marketing traps, you will miss out on a few hits but pass on dozens of losers.)<p>(Also, I am aware there are still some True Believers using RDF. My point here is not disproved by a couple people using it, even using it in a big way. My point will only be disproved if someone brings about RDF Utopia, the actual promises. Of course you can bash RDF into submission, but that doesn't prove it was the <i>best solution</i> for your problem.)",1296748610

The x^x^... function is actually a limit, and evaluating it requires deciding that it does approach a limit in the first place.

With a little bit of coordination regarding semantics (OWL, etc.), it's also a great way for people in related but distinct fields to share their data with one another.<p>That said, RDF has historically had three main problems, IMHO. The first is that its proponents have, historically speaking, done a crappy job of explaining what it actually is, and a worse job of demonstrating what it can do.<p>The second problem is that it's not really the most human-readable format around, especially in its XML serialization format. This is largely because it wasn't designed for human-readability, but in the age of the Web (where human-readable formats have shown to have major advantages over non-human-readable ones), this is a liability. They've added some more readable serialization formats over the years, but a lot of the documentation and tutorials assume that you'll be working in XML.<p>When I first tried to learn about RDF, years ago, all I found were tutorials full of really gnarly-looking XML with minimal explanation of what was going on. I spent so much time getting bogged down by the syntax that I missed the point entirely.<p>The third, and bigger, problem with RDF, is that it's a little hard to ""grok"" if you don't have a good grounding in predicate logic, description logics, and some of its other theoretical underpinnings.

Here's the latest version of what I've been saying to them.]<p>Let's look at RDF like a startup: The old RDF marketing from, say, 2003 was hopelessly out-of-touch with reality. Users were never going publish their metadata as RDF, and even if they did, you'd need strong AI to use it. Here are two classic articles spelling out why classic RDF wouldn't work:<p><a href=""http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm</a>\n<a href=""http://www.shirky.com/writings/semantic_syllogism.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirky.com/writings/semantic_syllogism.html</a><p>But things have been looking up in the RDF market lately. The complicated RDF XML serialization is mostly ignored in favor of simple n-triples. Google is making heavy use of RDFa metadata when searching for products, and something like 3.5% of web pages now contain RDFa. The RDF conferences are booming. There are cool projects like dbpedia that are organizing publicly-available information as RDF.<p>So if the RDF tool vendors are going to succeed, they need to pivot (and many of them are). They need to drop the AI hype, and focus on what their early users are telling them. Some possible sales pitches:<p>1) RDF is useful as a distributed, schema-free graph database. Competition: Neo4J, other NoSQL databases. There's a couple of very good sales pitches here, including the fact that RDF databases are available from multiple vendors, and that RDF inference can be used to normalize schemas between different data sources.<p>2) RDF is useful for embedding small amounts of data in web pages. Competition: Microformats.",1296746972

Is the problem in the routers/switches/etc in the switching/peering points? If so, a moderate capex would do some serious upgrading. Is it in the fiber, and is there still any dark-fiber? If so, again the capex is moderate to fix the problem.  For both these the greedy is deplorable on the teleco's part. On the other hand, if the problem is ""we need to run lots more fiber"".

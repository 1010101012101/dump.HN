1265173,story,,,2,0,ThePlague,"Ask HN: Feedback requested for an argument about P =/= NP",,"An argument that P != NP<p>1) Multiplication problems (a<i>b, a AND b) are less computationally expensive than addition problems (a+b) by a factor of about 2.<p>2) NP problems can have in the worst case scenario somewhere in the vicinity of N^K OR operations.<p>3) P problems have OR operations on the order of N</i>K operations.<p>4) The increase of AND problems as P --> NP scales linearly in terms of increased computational cost by (1) so we mostly
   consider the increase of cost due to OR problems as P --> NP.<p>5) The cost of NP diverges rapidly from P as the number of addition problems (OR operations) increases.<p>6) By (5) whereas muliplication problems (AND operations) scale linearly as P --> NP, this does not occur for OR operations.
   An N-SAT problem with many OR operators will always be more difficult than a problem with say N AND gates.<p>7) Because of the diverging cost of OR as P --> NP, NP cannot be reduced into P, as that would put OR and AND operations on the same
   footing which cannot be done by (1).<p>8) As by (7) NP does not reduce to P, P != NP.<p>Justification of (1) that OR is more expensive than AND:<p>The problem 2 * 3 is solved by taking pointer p and increasing it by length p, that is to say,
moving p from pointing at memory block 3 and moving it down 3 blocks to point at memory block 6.<p>The problem 2 + 3 is solved by adding a pointer p1, and adding this to p, such that p + p1 gives
a state in which p1 is pointed at memory block 5.<p>The second operation (2 + 3) is more expensive than the first operation (2*3) because
in the second one we needed two pointers, p and p1, whereas in the first we only had the one pointer,
p.<p>Thus OR problems (addition operations) need in general more pointers to solve than AND problems
(multiplication operations) which translates into being computationally more expensive.",1271259460

Mine paints SVG directly rather than using Raphael, so it only works with browsers that support that standard.  One thing this brought to my attention is that the WebKit SVG implementation is much, much faster than Gecko's.",1271258094

I have a few nitpicks for everyone's consideration.<p>>* The source code is more than 100 MB.<p>Excluding images, example usage, and generated documentation, sure.<p>>* Your code tries to install into /opt or /usr/local [ +10 points of FAIL ]<p>Installing to /usr/local is the accepted default for linux. Plus, I actually use the package manager on my system. I want compiled software to install to /opt or /usr/local so I can find it later and remove it if necessary.<p>Now trying to install to /opt on windows is just stupid.<p>>* Your code does not have per-file licensing [ +10 points of FAIL ]<p>This is pedantic. If the entire codebase is under the same license which is given as LICENSE in the program's folder you're good. (You should make it clear in README that LICENSE does apply to the entire project.) If not, any inconsistent licensing should be <i>explicitly</i> defined either in a visible top level document next to LICENSE which lists each exception clearly (e.g. stuff in multiverse/ is proprietary, see multiverse/<project>/LICENSE for details) or at the top of each file that doesn't match the license in LICENSE.",1271258039

Right now, my experience doesn't really extend beyond basic pie/bar/scatter graphs.<p>I've heard amazing things about Tufte, but looking at the previews of his books on Amazon they seem mostly focused on artistic presentations of information - something a marketer or analyst would create manually, not dynamic charts generated from terabytes of data.

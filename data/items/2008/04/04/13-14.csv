154784,comment,154692,154735,0,0,wallflower,,,"> It's not so much to ""open my mind"" as it is to keep myself marketable after Java's impending demise.<p>As someone who is starting to step out of the comfort zone of Java, I agree about marketability. However, Java is not going to disappear, it's firmly entrenched. It's like COBOL. I'm not sure how Sun pulled it off exactly but Java in it's 13 years has spread itself in a lot of corporate systems/applications/backends (some of which may be COBOL). Ruby on Rails and other minority languages are the minority in some companies precisely because the majority don't like the minority (""RoR? We don't use that""). However, there are some rogues in companies who are trying to bring RoR in discretely (I'm trying to be one - developing business cases for RoR adoption on small projects)",1207317475

Not sure if I'm actually breaking my promise, but this article was too compelling to ignore.  The author states what I've intuitively known all along, but was never really able to explain.<p>I am proficient in about a dozen languages, but only use 3.  I go back to the SPS, PL1, Fortran, and COBOL days, and would rather chew razor blades than ever use them again.  Today, I use javascript on the client and php on the server; I have yet to find a problem I couldn't solve with them.<p>In the years in between I discovered BASIC and have found it to be the Swiss army knife of apps.  Not the old Dartmouth Basic, and certainly not anything Microsoft bastardized, but there are many other versions that seamlessly integrate with relational data bases that I think are a dream.  <laughter dies down><p>It's actually reached the point where I ""think"" in BASIC, design my app, and then sometimes write in in javascript or php.<p>I certainly wouldn't recommend my approach to someone else, but I think that's the whole point.  Use the right tool for the job and get good at it.  I see no need to learn new languages just for the purpose of learning something new.  If I get ""curious"" or want to expand my mind, I can think of several hundred app problems waiting to be solved in any language, take your pick.<p>Thanks, Gustavo Duarte, for the chance to put a little thought into this.

But I think the point of the advice to learn more programming languages is to expose yourself to different programming paradigms. And in order to do this, I don't think you need to become an expert in the nuances of that language, but you need to become comfortable in thinking in new ways.<p>If your language of choice is C, and you learn Pascal, then you haven't gained any new concepts. But if your language of choice is C, and you learn Prolog, then you will be exposed to a whole new way of thinking.<p>My native state of coding is procedural with a sprinkling of OO, mainly to represent families of concrete data types. I find functional programming appealing on an emotional level, and my attempts to learn how to think functionally have changed my native coding habits, even in non-functional languages.<p>My pragmatic advice is learn enough of a language from a different programming paradigm so you can apply that new way of thinking to your native language.",1207317273

154765,comment,154692,154741,0,0,jjburka,,,"I think really what he is arguing is the marginal benefit of learning a new language diminishes with each new language. Which is probably true if you only learn the syntax and then move on. But thats not what software development is ,the language is a tool that a culture uses. Using your example with Rails , alot of its culture (MVC , TDD , etc) seem to be being adopted in other communities. I would argue that the reason is someone had a extended vacation in Hotel Rails liked what they saw and then brought it home. Finding out how different people do different things and adapting them to your needs is valuable in all contexts.",1207316476

154750,comment,154680,154708,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Really, the main risk of changing code that doesn't need to be changed is that there is input data out there, which you don't have access to, that works fine with the current code but your refactoring might introduce some incompatibility. Of course, depending on the situation, it can still be worth munging the code to be more manageable, but I would certainly not do that without a reasonable set of tests.<p>Well, writing the tests <i>after</i> some exploratory programming can work just fine, especially when you're tackling a defect of some kind, such as ""this input doesn't work"". The first thing I'd do is figure out why it doesn't work, and then try a fix. Then try and guess at some possible new failures you might have introduced, and feed the original code and your changes with the test cases and see if you get what you expect. Then throw in loads of random real-world input data to make sure that still works.<p>I'm not suggesting there are hard-and-fast rules here, I'm just trying to suggest some techniques that have worked well for me. Foreign code is always tricky and is always as much about making your own changes as it is about damage limitation. It's like making changes to your own code, except with blindfolds on.",1207314886

As a hobby cool, but not for profit. I can agree with that. There are all sorts of topics you could learn for fun and profit, and investing in a new language is not necessarily the silver bullet to mad coin.<p>Who cares though? I think as long as we're constantly learning, whether it's new programming languages, economics, or snowbaording, it makes life interesting. New skills always seem to come in useful at some point. Make the investment in learning things that interest you and it'll always pay off. Don't let someone else tell you what NOT to learn. That's jut silly.

154741,comment,154692,154719,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"You should finish it. By the end of the essay, the guy has successfully argued himself out of half of his original thesis, and has laid the seeds for finishing off the other half. That's one of the good side effects of essay writing: You can start out arguing one thing and eventually find yourself having to argue something else.<p>One of the things the guy missed is there in plain sight in his essay:<p><i>You need to get to know the libraries, struggle with the environment, find or tune a text editor, look for tools, and so on. Most of the effort has to do with housekeeping chores, which are surely not mind-expanding by anyone's measure. If you hope to be productive in the new language, things are even bleaker: proficiency has less to do with the language itself than with the myriad technologies you must master to use it effectively.</i><p>Unfortunately, everyday productivity <i>is</i> a lot of housekeeping chores, one after another. While your higher mind is soaring with the architecture astronauts, the rest of your mind had better be editing text efficiently, and running <i>top</i> and <i>netstat</i>, and administering the version control system.<p>And more than half of the point of learning a new language is to force yourself to experiment with a different tool ecosystem. The point of learning Ruby isn't just to learn Ruby: You get to learn about Rails and Capistrano and the obsessive use of test-driven development and, in my case, git. (If I'd been a kernel hacker, I'd have known about git. I presume the Rails folks learned about git because some kernel hackers, seeking to learn a new language, wandered into the Rails community.) You want to be forced to experiment with different tools because sometimes they're better: git is just a <i>much</i> better tool than Subversion, and don't get me started on CVS. Even when the alternatives aren't better, you become a better technologist by playing with them. If I'd never played with a Java IDE I would have no chance of understanding how Java programmers think. If I'd never actually deployed both Rails and PHP I wouldn't understand why PHP deserved to live. (Yes, it's filled with stupidly broken parts, but it's <i>so easy</i> to deploy, and it's fast, and it's not that hard to comprehend.)<p>The other thing this guy doesn't seem to understand is that there's a difference between tourism and living in another country. When you ""learn a new language every year"" that doesn't mean you have to become a <i>pro</i> in your new language. You can visit, kick the tires, read a couple of introductory books, write some simple code, read some code to something more complicated, and then move on. Yes, that means you're a dilettante -- but it's better to be a dilettante than to blindly plug away at the same thing for a decade.",1207314166

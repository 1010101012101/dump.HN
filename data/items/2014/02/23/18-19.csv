Lots of large services peer directly with consumer ISPs because it&#x27;s cheaper and more efficient than using intermediary transit.<p>This has nothing to do with net neutrality. Comcast is not throttling or discriminating traffic in any way (at least not publicly). This is a peering dispute settlement.<p>Does this affect competitors to Netflix? Depends on how much volume they have. If their volumes are low, they can still reliably use transit providers more economically. As their revenue increases, they&#x27;ll need their own backbone network, but their ability to pay for it goes up too.<p>Is Comcast big, bad and evil? Probably. But not in this case. Comcast dealing directly with Netflix is good for both parties. They are entitled to charge Netflix to peer directly because most traffic is going to flow into Comcast&#x27;s network from Netflix. They also probably had a case negotiating away from settlement-free agreements with Cogent for the same reason. Again, none of this is out of the ordinary, ASes negotiate peering deals with each other all the time based on the volume and direction of the traffic they exchange with each other, and this is all fairly unregulated.<p>Net neutrality is irrelevant in all of this, it only matters if Comcast actively discriminates between traffic at their end.

Peering is a practice performed at ISPs where two ISPs hook up infrastructure and agree to maintain their sides without charging for bandwidth.

CPC&#x27;s would be low right off the bat, with a $200-300/day campaign.<p>Then, when he just suddenly increased to $100,000/day, he would have absolutely tore through the cheap available impressions within a matter of minutes, leaving only the more expensive users, with much higher CPC&#x27;s.<p>As soon as the CPC skyrocketed, he should have pulled the plug on the campaign.

It&#x27;s common throughout the industry and content-providers are always looking to peer with ISPs to drive down their overall costs of operations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://openconnect.netflix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openconnect.netflix.com</a>",1393179524

I don&#x27;t see how a hypothetical motivation pill will do much better than an anti-depressant drug.<p>What I find interesting though is this stigma around depression, lack of motivation and laziness. There&#x27;s nothing unbecoming, wrong or unnatural about any of these states. We don&#x27;t need to stamp it out completely.<p>Winston Churchill had severe depression but he was arguably one of the most productive people in the 20th century. Lazy people often come up with brilliant inventions (in order to do less work). And lack of motivation can often be addressed by life style changes.<p>Maybe for one person the lack of motivation is because the work they engage in isn&#x27;t meaningful to them. For another person, the work may be meaningful but they are missing connection from other people. The next person might not be leading a healthy lifestyle so they are not providing their body an environment in which they can thrive (not enough nutrients/sun light etc). And yet another person may simply be experiencing a natural oscillation between being motivated and unmotivated. All of these things can be addressed in some way or another.<p>Personally, I found the education system a factor in robbing me of motivation and questioning my drive. I didn&#x27;t get really motivated about learning until I got out of it and picked topics I was truly curious about. But up until that point I would almost have considered myself as kind of broken because I was doing the bare minimum to pass tests when I could be doing so much more. The only thing that changed for me to tap into my drive was the conditions I set. Now I learn because I&#x27;m driven by curiosity and a drive to make things.<p>It would be a pity if people start taking pills without addressing these other things (at least in conjunction).<p>Having said that, for specific treatment alternatives, I think the future is much brighter with neuro/bio feedback technologies.

I mean this is a cute problem assuming the following:<p>1. All the prisoners have perfect memory (for this problem)<p>2. All the prisoners actually want to live.<p>3. The warden is telling the truth<p>4. The guards are all honest.<p>These are all the type of assumption that gets websites hacked. So what is the attack surface here?<p>* One of the prisoners decides this is a fun way to suicide<p>* One of the prisoners is in gang A, and one is in gang B. They value gang honor above their own life, and need to take out the other.<p>* A guard has decided that this is a great way to off some &quot;scum&quot;<p>* A prisoner forgets the algorithm, or hits the wrong switch, or other form of human error.<p>* As if_by_whisky points out: someone dies before the full run.<p>* The warden just wants to mess with people before feeding them to alligators, and just states &quot;wrong&quot; whenever someone declares all have visited.<p>* A prisoner can&#x27;t handle the stakes, and cracks and makes the declaration early.<p>* The leader messes up the count.<p>There are probably a lot more.<p>Further, the warden is making assumptions that we can&#x27;t be sure are true. Prisons are notorious for being bad at doing the actual security thing. Are there ways for prisoners to collude and do extra error checking on their end? Can a guard be bribed to help share state?

In fact I&#x27;m pretty sure there a some combinations where everyone is just fucked. But, what can be done to add robustness to this problem? It seems pretty silly for prisoners (likely malicious actors as a generalization) will follow the rules and stay within the constraints the warden sets out.<p>I ask, because I&#x27;ve solved plenty of things in a nice elegant way, that were trivially broken by not assuming everything will play nicely in the environment.

You will now likely need to set up a massive infrastructure and pay massive bribes to various internet providers to be able to compete. So this is probably a smart move by Netflix by creating entry barriers that they should be able to easily pass on to consumers if they can achieve market dominance.",1393178821

By definition it&#x27;s more popular than each one of them.<p>If there&#x27;s a bug in Chrome, it affects only 30 percent of the browsing market - the Chrome market. If there&#x27;s a bug in Flash, it affects 95 percent of the browsing market.<p>That&#x27;s why it would&#x27;ve been much better if Adobe open sourced Flash a long time ago, because then each browser could do their own implementation of Flash, just like they do with many other open specs today, and then if there was a bug in Chrome&#x27;s Flash, it would&#x27;ve only affected the Chrome market.<p>It&#x27;s too late to open source Flash now, but we&#x27;re doing that instead with alternatives like the HTML5 video tag and WebGL (for animations).",1393178801

The best source of growth is increasing revenue stream. Advertising, in turn, was 96% of their revenue in ~2012^1.<p>They&#x27;re going to try to find other revenue streams. But advertising is clearly not going anywhere.<p>We&#x27;re still figuring out how advertising is going to keep working. And honestly, advertising is huge money and is what is driving the fierce battle over mobile at the moment. Here we have what is possibly the last great expansion of fresh eyeballs, and it is crucial for the existing companies to figure out how to serve them ads. Hence Android and the WhatsApp purchase.<p>So. If you have a feature that in any way can improve upon 96% of their business, that glove will probably fit.<p>I mean, I doubt Google Cars is seriously so they can show commuters more ads. They have a deep capacity for machine learning, and they bought Boston Dynamics; I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll see lots more Google automation in the coming years.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/29/google-advertising/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/29/google-advertising/</a>",1393178404

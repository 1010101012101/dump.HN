You seem to think that the whole issue is in (b) - that there's something about the US that causes more people to act unlawfully, to transgress. Have you considered other possibilities, such as unjust laws, or unequal application of laws?<p>Besides that, there's social issues, whereby subgroups are disadvantaged and have fewer opportunities for lawful profit in life.

It's a technology with high emotional bandwidth. This means we want to use it for longer and more intimate calls. It should therefore be priced as low as possible. When it was first launched in Europe it was marketed as a premium version of voice calls and thus much more expensive. This was wrong.
Compare this with SMS which has a very low emotional bandwidth. This type of communication is much more rapid and we accept a higher price per byte.",1293187866
2037043,comment,2036586,2036842,0,0,riffraff,,,"by function you mean a function call? two pages down, and replace it's about 8 keystrokes (ctrl-f-f to get to second page, say /<first-two-chars> to get to the function, cw to change it) does that take you more than two seconds? Also, you'd probably just do search instead of moving down two pages, and then replace (/<first-three-chars>cw).

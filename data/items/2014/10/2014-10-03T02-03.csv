8404171,comment,8402079,8404140,5,0,burntsushi,,,"Well... I guess I need to clear up a few things!<p>- What I said in my previous comment in no way applies to programming languages. It applies to my programming <i>environment</i>. I very much enjoy using different kinds of languages. (There are definitely some that I dislike and stay away from though.)<p>- I do not think I&#x27;ve found the perfect anything or &quot;the one right answer.&quot; I continue to improve my setup. I have spent more years in Windows than in Linux, so I am aware of what I&#x27;m missing in that regard. My tactic is not to remain static; it is to iteratively <i>improve</i>. So far, it has lead me deeper and deeper into the terminal. (My next big task is migrating email into the console. It is a task so daunting and terrifying that I&#x27;ve procrastinated on it for years.)<p>- I very strongly disagree with your disconnect between annoyance and efficiency. If I&#x27;m getting annoyed, then my emotional state is an impediment to focusing and working productively. Drudgery is annoying and frustrating and error prone. I don&#x27;t really swear by any <i>particular</i> config as some Universal Truth, but I do have strong opinions about what works well <i>for me</i>. And I will spend an exuberant amount of time fixing it, especially if there is an engineering challenge involved (because, why not, we&#x27;re hackers and it&#x27;s <i>fun</i> to do that stuff). If the only thing you think you gained is &quot;saving a few key strokes,&quot; then I agree that it probably isn&#x27;t a useful tweak in most cases. What I gain by tweaking is compartmentalization and automation, and they usually pay for themselves in due time.<p>- Haha yes, I&#x27;m not quite <i>old</i> yet, but I&#x27;ve been at it for over a decade at this point. So not exactly a fresh lamb either. :-)<p>Thanks for indulging in some friendly banter!",1412304609

However, I think there are some general guidelines that work in a &quot;most people, most of the time&quot; kind-of-way.<p>With that said, I think that most severe alcoholics can never go back to drinking. The damage has been done, and they will always have that vulnerability. They may be able to control it for a while, even a surprisingly long time, but, if they go back to drinking or using then they will be thoroughly screwed.<p>There are people who may have issues that look like alcoholism, but are really different, like ADHD or depression. As those other issues get better, then the alcoholism will become less of a problem. For example, people with ADHD tend to have problems with impulse control. As people live their lives they learn that poor impulse control is, indeed, a real problem and they learn how to get it under control more-or-less on their own. That same lack of impulse control is disastrous when combined with alcohol. But, as their impulse control gets better, their problems with alcohol get easier, too.<p>Some people simply have had a crappy childhood, and, as they get more distance and grow out of those issues, then their tendency to addiction gets less.",1412303956

My ideal job would have me bouncing between different operating systems, hardware, and languages all the time. For career reasons, and just to feed my curiosity, I have a fear of getting too comfortable with any one workflow/language/OS/etc. Plus familiarity breeds contempt- every time I thought I found the perfect anything, it was only because I hadn&#x27;t been using it long enough to hit any of the pain points.<p>I&#x27;ve come to feel really strongly that there is no one right answer when it comes to those things. Sometimes there are wrong answers (I wouldn&#x27;t write a word processor for a desktop OS in assembly if I didn&#x27;t have to), but rarely is there ever one right answer, and there&#x27;s usually something to be learned from all of the viable alternatives. If I get too used to one particular environment, to the point where I refuse to use anything other than that one environment, then I would feel like I was missing out on a lot of cool stuff by ignoring the rest of the computing world.<p>The other side of it is that I&#x27;ve also come to feel really strongly that a lot of the tweaks and optimizations that people swear by and obsess over with (for example) their editor configs aren&#x27;t actually improving efficiency. When I&#x27;ve gotten into deep configuration and automation and optimally efficient usage of vim or emacs, it felt like I was more efficient, but in hindsight I don&#x27;t think I actually was. I might&#x27;ve saved a few keystrokes here and there, but at most the extra keystrokes I shaved off were annoyances, and not meaningful impediments to my efficiency. I spent so much more time learning how to shave off those few keystrokes that it&#x27;s unlikely that I&#x27;ll ever get it back via repeated usage of what I learned.<p>That&#x27;s just me though, everybody&#x27;s got different motivations for why they do what they do. I would like to think that all of the above comes from hard-earned experience, but it&#x27;s just as likely to be my own preferences and values. When you get super old like me, you get to pass off your personal preferences as genuine wisdom learned the hard way over many long years. :)",1412302379

8404119,comment,8403783,8403783,3,0,russellbeattie,,,"The root problem here is that every HTML WYSIWIG editor (from MS Word to TinyMCE) uses their own special blend of tags when creating HTML. There&#x27;s only a handful of tags that are generated by Markdown, the problem is that editors often don&#x27;t use standard tags (e.g. <span class=&quot;bold&quot;>) or they try to do too much and enable every feature that exists in HTML. This causes an absolute mess where one editor can&#x27;t really parse another&#x27;s output. (Sometimes the web based ones have trouble dealing with their own markup - turning HTML into a write-only language akin to regex).<p>Markdown is just a horrible solution to this problem. Rather than &#x27;Common Markdown&#x27; there really needs to be &#x27;Common Markup&#x27; which strictly limits the tags WYSIWYG editors use. This would enable true interop and solve the real issue for most people who could - like the author pointed out - see the formatting they were using.<p>Think of it as the equivalent of ASM.js for markup - only the core tags (the ones Markdown uses) would be used, and only in a specific way. That would speed up parsing, processing and display and none of us would have to remember if adding a link uses () or [] first again (I always get it backwards).",1412301617

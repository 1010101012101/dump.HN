This scenario is possible, happened multiple times throughout the history and undermines the &quot;brain&quot; model.

They really just do all the hard work, and make it easy for the criminals.<p>Obviously, a huge blunder of government, totally irresponsible and reckless that such a massive breach was even possible. And it happened in dec 2014, and they only just now found out. A team of amateurs could do better than that.<p>I know data security is hard, but maybe if the government spent money on proper protections of people&#x27;s data instead of building data centers to spy on it&#x27;s citizens, this wouldn&#x27;t have happened. But it&#x27;s clear that&#x27;s not what their priorities are.<p>Really, just disgusted by this.<p>That said, what did they do wrong? what should they have done, that they didn&#x27;t do? Getting hacked seems like an eventuality at some level. What can an organization do to protect such sensitive information, or at least reduce their exposure and the amount of data that is able to be leaked before detection?<p>Seems like you&#x27;d have to partition up your data at some level, maybe encrypt it at rest; but I don&#x27;t know how far one has to go.",1434210961

(Most startups read like social/marketing experiments that happen to need a web page). So they don&#x27;t need to hire people with actual experience, and since the tech is largely disposable, fashion tends to rule.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean all programming is like that though.

9711368,comment,9710878,9710878,0,0,doctorpangloss,,,"Many of the games he might already be familiar with have sandbox, modding or programming-like environments that require no documentation to get started.<p>If he plays Minecraft, he should definitely study Redstone (<a href=""http://www.minecraft101.net/redstone/redstone-basics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minecraft101.net/redstone/redstone-basics.html</a>). You can make whole computers with it (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQqWorbrAaY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQqWorbrAaY</a>). It&#x27;s what I recommend to my friends who are looking to get their children into programming or making games. Don&#x27;t underestimate how much more compelling Minecraft is than literally everything else out there.<p>Starcraft II is free, and its map editor is excellent for nearly every kind of top-down game. It&#x27;s a very drag-and-drop sort of interface that doesn&#x27;t require any programming. You can probably build the widest variety of games with it.<p>Team Fortress 2, which is also free, comes with the Hammer Editor. It&#x27;s a little more idiosyncratic than Starcraft II&#x27;s map editor, but also a great way to just drop things in and play. It&#x27;s ideal for first person shooters.<p>A bunch of games have really fascinating programming-like experiences. DOTA 2 (free) has its Workshop Tools; Cities: Skylines (paid) has an Asset Builder and programmed mods. A lot of these games are a bit above 12 years old though, so it might be a little intimidating.<p>I think for most kids, they&#x27;re more interested in Garry&#x27;s Mod (<a href=""http://www.garrysmod.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.garrysmod.com</a>) and Little Big Planet—sandbox environments. You just do stuff and things happen, and it&#x27;s all very pseudo-physical.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some other recommendations on here. Generally most kids aren&#x27;t equipped with the amount of patience these actual programming environments require. If you insist on programming, then Scratch is the best of the options. Check out the first assignment in Harvard&#x27;s CS50 class here (<a href=""http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/spring/psets/0/pset0/pset0.html#itching_to_program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/spring/psets/0/pset0/pset0.html#itc...</a>). To put in perspective, this is regarded as one of the easiest to learn and most polished programming environments, and students at University level (almost twice your son&#x27;s age!) are given 2 weeks to make something. So as an introduction, this is still extremely hard.<p>Conversely, things like Unity3D are going to be super crazy complicated, to be completely honest. It&#x27;s disheartening to read any documentation. Just orbiting the camera in the viewport is a skill. Plus, lots of kids like to build multiplayer experiences, which are all possible with the map-making and modding tools above, but not possible with any of the actual coding frameworks written below.",1434210662

The reason behind my choice is that while there is indeed a multi-level struggle for power where we have coalitions playing against coalitions, there is also some inter-nation rivalries that highlight the fundamentally non-cooperative nature of the &quot;game&quot;.<p>The US weakening the influence of the French leader Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s for example is an example of such tension between members of a same &quot;coalition&quot;. The US will first and foremost (legitimately) defend its own interests over those of its allies.<p>> Also, nation-states are not atomic entities who can be considered &quot;players&quot;.<p>I disagree.

The lesson learned was we have two choices: (a) device is secured the moment you activate it; (b) the interface between trusted and untrusted (Red/Black separation) blocks as much data is needed until the secure link is established then forces everything over it. The latter is the solution here and their recommendations are pretty good.<p>There&#x27;s another risk, though: the WiFi layer and TCP/IP stacks themselves. These might be hacked and WiFi is regularly by NSA per leaks. This is why high assurance wireless VPN&#x27;s they endorse use a dedicated device for secure wifi connections. It works as follows: a device/chip for trusted data with a physical connection to PC; a secure chip in middle for crypto & control logic; a device/chip for untrusted code (esp Wifi driver) and data with connection to antenna. Some use separation kernels instead of different chips these days. The device is programmed to not let &quot;trusted&quot; data through until (a) untrusted chip says wireless is working and (b) VPN is established in middle chip. It can be modified to deal with captive portals although that creates potential covert channels or attacks. Maybe one can tie a sandboxed browser to the untrusted chip for approving the terms. It and the channel are killed the moment Internet is reachable. More work needs to be done in this area.<p>Regular setups not worried about targeted hacks will probably be fine following the advice in the article.

9711333,comment,9704723,9708148,0,0,lambdaelite,,,"Inexpensive ones.<p>Kidding aside, as a startup, our needs and capabilities are quite different from a more established company.  We can&#x27;t afford to pay for consultants to fly business class, nor expensive per diems.  We can&#x27;t afford to implement heavyweight development processes, nor should we since being nimble is one of the few advantages we have as a startup.  Software licensing costs is a concern at this stage, so we&#x27;d rather do a subscription for a (for example) CAD package even if it&#x27;s not the industry standard over buying a license for the industry standard package.  Also frustrating in general is that as a medical device, our volumes are never &quot;large&quot; in the consumer sense and so many common manufacturing processes (e.g., injection molding) are not practical, nor are companies excited to supply parts in our expected volumes—our consultants need to consider what are sometimes less common processes or smaller, &quot;hungrier&quot; suppliers.  For many things, the budget is driving the bus, and it&#x27;s within reason acceptable to need to spend more in the future if it means we can spend less now.<p>It can be hard to find the a consultant at an experienced group (and domain expertise is what we need) that is willing to work with us.  Our future business is not guaranteed (statistically we are likely to fail), the business we will be bringing is small, and we&#x27;re pinching pennies on what we bring.  What seems to have worked is to find a &quot;hungry&quot; associate-level consultant (keeps costs lower) at a larger group who can tap into the experience of senior/principal-level consultants on demand.  We point out that, if successful, we&#x27;ll be able to bring more business to the associate-level consultants, so we both will grow together.<p>I&#x27;ll give a specific example, stream of consciousness style partly out of laziness.  We have a software component, and a portion will be safety-critical... crap, things just got more expensive.  We know we need to develop the device under a risk-management plan (ISO 14971), so we don&#x27;t need consultants to tell us that, but we may need them do to a design review because we don&#x27;t have enough in-house experts (how many do we need?).  We know that the software component must be developed under a SDLC (ISO 62304).  Should we do it agile (as per AAMI TIR-45, not cowboy agile nonsense), or a more traditional V-model?  Does CMMI or PSP apply to us?  Should I listen to the nice people at IBM and use Harmony, or are they preying on a poor (emphasis on poor) innocent startup?  It&#x27;d be nice to have a consultant advise us, based on their experience, that one or the other works better <i>for a startup</i>.  Have we properly identified the safety-critical portions of our design?  What should the development environment look like: is MISRA-C everywhere the right answer?  Probably not.  So MISRA-C for the safety-critical portion, and regular C everywhere else?  Or should we do Java/RTSJ with a fancy JVM?  Ada/SPARK?  We could justify any of these, and probably others.  What are the costs of tooling for each choice, licensing costs, how hard will it be to find employees/contractors (should we use contractors? how many will I need to hire?), and what will productivity look like?  What about maintainability?  Is QNX better than VxWorks?  Is model-based systems engineering worthwhile, or is it an expensive buzzword?  Those nice people at IBM said Rational is great, and it&#x27;ll tie into DOORS!  And they said DOORS is great!  Maybe I should use Excel instead of DOORS, I heard from a guy on the internet that works just fine.  And so on...<p>So for much of this, we want an experienced consultant that can review case histories and show us that in the past, comparable companies were successful by doing X, and so it makes sense for us to go that route too.  Many times we know we need to do something, and frequently how to do something at a larger company, but not the optimal way to do it <i>at a startup</i>.  I can do a decision matrix, but without the case histories, there&#x27;s too many gaps in the matrix to be useful.  We also need to have external people for design reviews, and figure out when we need to pull in those external people, when we don&#x27;t, and when we should.  I need to be able to tell the regulators that our processes were based on industry best practices.  I need to be able to tell board members the same, and be able to tell them that our processes and plans have a successful track record at comparable companies to justify the time/cost/etc.  I want to be able to show shareholders that we&#x27;re being good stewards with their investments, and we&#x27;re doing that by making careful, informed choices.",1434210029

Especially when Teddy is considered controversially within the sport, as both a guy who&#x27;s been in boxing for a long time and respected for it, but also as a guy who is a complete idiot. I stopped taking his comments seriously quite a while ago.<p>In the Geale fight I saw the headbutt, too and I agree they should&#x27;ve mentioned it. I actually rewinded the video the same day to see if it was a headbutt and it was. But it&#x27;s not controversial or corrupt because Geale was getting a total annihilation. Geale didn&#x27;t even mention it, hell he quit, a sign that the headbutt wasn&#x27;t at all a factor but that he simply wasn&#x27;t able to do anything in the last 3 rounds and kept eating the left hand.<p>But yeah the point on viewership being nr 1 priority in boxing is completely true. Boxing has no league system, no rankings, no single federation. Its matchmaking politics behind closed doors, and those are based on viewership because that brings in the money, which often has nothing to do with making the most competitive matchup. And that indeed means people dodge GGG, a Kazakh who lives in Germany, fights the US, and who&#x27;s got a 90% chance of knocking you out, is not a fight anyone wants to take because it&#x27;s little money for lots of risk.<p>Lara&#x27;s been talking about moving up to meet GGG though, that&#x27;d be interesting. And Froch in the UK, perhaps in Wembley again, that&#x27;d be interesting (and not easy for GGG either). After one of these fights GGG will probably have a big enough name to fight some big fights. Canelo&#x27;s the next goldenboy, he makes money whoever he fights, and he weighs more than GGG even at SWW, so a GGG Canelo fight is likely for late 2016 or early 2017. Golovkin&#x27;s biggest problem though is that 160 is just a really thin division right now and all the big opponents and money is below and above him. Even the nr 2 and 3 (ignoring Cotto) in Quillin and Lee are a joke, and ignoring them as they&#x27;re dodging GGG and aren&#x27;t special boxers anyway, GGG cleaned out the entire 160 division. There&#x27;s nothing really left for him there, but without guys like Froch/Ward at 168, moving up isn&#x27;t a great move either. And moving down to 154 makes little sense as SWW guys like Canelo weigh 174 for his 154 fight, while Golovkin weighs just 170 for his 160 fights. It&#x27;s really hard for him.<p>About your Don King note, replace him with Al Haymon and you&#x27;ve got your list of 2 guys running boxing this day and age, Arum and Haymon.

The problem is that the man-child oligarchy that has taken over Silicon Valley (and, because of SV&#x27;s influence, the industry as a whole, at least culturally) doesn&#x27;t value fundamental or technical work (as opposed to doing &quot;make the thingy work with the other thingy&quot; Scrum tickets for a PM barely old enough to drink) so there are so few people doing it, and the competition for positions in real programming is quite high (and the salaries, sadly, aren&#x27;t as good).<p>It&#x27;s easier to get a real programming job at 30 than at 22, but fake programming jobs outnumber real ones by such a large margin. And when you&#x27;re older and have a family to feed, being too old for the well-paid but fake programming jobs at the Hoolis becomes somewhat of a problem, because real programming jobs are so rare that it sometimes involves a cross-country move to get one.<p><i>Ergo, you&#x27;re old and out of touch and worthless and go live on a programmer retirement farm in iowa because you&#x27;re not a culture fit with the 22 year old CEOs anymore. yolo, and you wasted it by not becoming a billionaire by 28.</i><p>I think that attracting the &quot;old&quot; programmers to a specific city (possibly in the Midwest, say Chicago or Minneapolis, but possibly one overseas like Budapest) is the first step step in taking over the world. I&#x27;m not sure what the second is, but an industry that tosses people out just as they&#x27;re beginning to get good at their jobs is (fuck this term in general, but here it applies) ripe for disruption.",1434209202

One thing i have found, with near ubiquity in refugee and ex-patriot communities, is the US gives a physical, intellectual, and emotional space to the beleaguered and suppressed. Another contribution is our over-active dissent factor; many Americans disagree with America, and for the most part this is not only accepted, it is respected. These are somewhat ethereal, though.<p>The US Navy is a power unlike any the world has ever seen. The capability to move gross tonnage as well as incredible skill into disaster zones is unparalleled. It is completely a product of the very fear mongering the author of the article speaks of.<p>The space program is a titan, historically. It may be the US&#x27;s single largest contribution to history. It is the wellspring of all of the greatest innovations of the late 20th century.<p>Europe&#x27;s universal health care is completely contigent upon not having to field the requisite military for a nation/region of its size and prosperity. The US military maintaining a stable and strong presence in mainland Europe gave governments and citizens the space, physically and intellectually, to evolve their positions on human rights, healthcare,citizenship, and education.<p>Please understand, in no way do i feel the US is soley responsible for these things. Indeed, anything of value is by definition collaborative.<p>Also understand, the US is far from perfect. But their are a number of stupidities and conflagrations i would like to address.<p>>the US is racist as opposed to the World
This is complete melarky. The US is by fare the most advanced nation on the planet in terms of dealing with the integration of races and cultures. We have the most diverse governmental representation of disparate cultures and races. We elected a person of african descent ~40 years after the Supreme Court forced education integration.<p>>The US are warmongers
The US are pigeon hawks. There are undeniably warmongers among us, and unfortunately many of them do have positions of power, but as a society we are actually quite weak in terms of resolve. The war on terror has claimed so few American lives that were it in actual war our gross total deaths would be statistically insignificant.<p>The original question is a great one, and it is one i will keep asking myself and others.<p>As to the consequences, for the US? Not much. It would free up a lot of resources. But for the world, specifically africa, it would be devastating. Would China spend billions and send thousands to combat AIDS, Malaria, and Ebola? Would Russia maintain an active military presence with almost 0 potential of territorial or economic gain? It is so easy to criticize the person in front, but it is usually quite challenging to keep up, much less surpass them.<p>For my part, i would love to see India take the US&#x27;s place in the world, but i believe there would be a struggle on the level of WWII between India and China before that would happen.<p>This meanders and it may be all horseshit, but i must reiterate how important this question is to me.<p><a href=""http://kiriakakis.net/comics/mused/a-day-at-the-park"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kiriakakis.net/comics/mused/a-day-at-the-park</a>",1434208456

And, of course, much of the ageism and sexism is unintentional but still exclusionary. See: open-plan offices and the aggressive micromanagement of Scrum.

I don’t think most people can imagine detailed photographic images (e.g. of faces), though there do seem to be some who can, like certain autistic savants.<p>It seems likely that people’s external verbalizations of their internal experience vary widely enough that it’s difficult or even impossible to gain a useful understanding of that experience from survey answers. Sort of like when people claim non-human mammals have no consciousness or sentience because they don’t talk.<p>For example, just because the picture-book illustrator profiled in this article has a “vivid imagination” doesn’t mean she can literally visualize a full-fidelity photographic mental image of a whole book spread. As a photographer, when I see a scene I can “previsualize” what kind of picture I might get after fully editing/printing the image days later. But that just means I can conceptualize particular visual effects, think about the lighting, texture, contrasts, colors, and put them together in an abstract thought, not that I can precisely “see” the picture exactly as if it were finished in front of me. I would say I have a “vivid imagination” for photographs, but my mental experience of remembered or imagined vision is probably pretty similar to yours.",1441104477

And in fact for my own trading I don&#x27;t use stops because they introduce downside that isn&#x27;t there in many other situations.  On the quant trading analyses that I have done, adding stops frequently makes performance strictly worse while not helping that much when things get really extremely bad, because of course there is no guarantee of liquidity at your stop level if the market is dropping like a stone.<p>So I&#x27;ve seen things like having a trigger in an order manager that at a certain price will place an aggressive IOC limit order to unwind something.  In normal conditions that will behave exactly like an at-market stop loss order, except that in the case of really extreme disruption you won&#x27;t get filled before your limit.  So the hope is in those cases the market will bounce.  You don&#x27;t want to get unwound at any cost on your stop if the market is going to rapidly recover afterwards.  It also means there&#x27;s no information leakage if you&#x27;re worried about your broker taking advantage of the information in your stop (paranoid, but yes...).<p>As you&#x27;ve said, there&#x27;s no panacea.",1441103997

Decision to have kids is not rational. Decision to have a LOT of kids (an old coworker has 10) ipmay even be accompanied by religious delusions or some misguided notion that one has a lineage to protect.<p>I think we should not incentivize people to have children. No tax break per dependent. No tax break for saving towards your children&#x27;s college. Basically, the only people who have kids should be people willing to take responsibility. Of course, we need to step up ways we take care of young people but it is the relationship between a society (through government I guess) and a young person. For example, easy, free of cost access to health care, easy, free of cost access to education, nutritious meals dad in school, and so on but no incentives for parents to have kids.<p>> The point I&#x27;m getting at is Wisdom of any given mob in Generation N > Wisdom of any given mob in Generation N+1, during and after the modern age.<p>I feel like this belief is similar to my previous ideas of a glorious past, almost a heaven we got handed down but were unable to keep up. We are looking at the past with Rose colored glasses. I mean surely the average man today is not as smart as Plato was has a mind to think in scientific processes as Lavoisier did. Now, I have to be careful of making a bad assumption that a newer generation is always wiser but I think I can safely say the newer generation has the benefit of hindsight.<p>Basically what I&#x27;m saying is while there seems to be a trend of decline, it might actually be a trend of enlightenment overall and we just see the top declining while we might not see all boats slowly rising.",1441102201

It&#x27;s hard to run a company for long if it&#x27;s not making money, regardless of what it&#x27;s market share is.<p>Market share matters for a lot of companies because economies of scale mean that your unit costs go down as volumes go up. This gives a natural advantage to market leaders, in addition to things like increased brand visibility.<p>Market share is very important to pundits though, because it changes very rapidly and is often measurable throughout the year on a per-product basis, whereas company financials are less frequently reported and harder to tease out. A battle between products that readers can see in the shops and read reviews for is easier to create a narrative around than corporate financial performance. I think this is why sales numbers and market share are focused on so heavily in the media.",1441102161

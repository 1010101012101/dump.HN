Obj-C devs sail right past said warnings, and most projects are not configured to flag these as errors instead.<p>One of the other issues with implicit casts is that it&#x27;s often non-obvious if what you&#x27;re doing is lossy - there are a lot of aliased or conditional types (for example: a CGFloat is a float on 32-bit systems, and double on 64-bit)<p>Also things like time measurement - a NSTimeInterval is a double, so casting it down to a float is lossy, but not obviously so because for the most part we don&#x27;t think about what&#x27;s the actual object backing a lot of system types.",1444686869

10377168,comment,10375426,10376700,0,0,codingdave,,,"I&#x27;m in Spanish Fork, UT. We live on 3 acres. We have our own well with water rights for the home and livestock. We used to have more, for field irrigation, but we did not use those water shares, and in Utah you either use your rights or lose them, so we sold them to the city. Water rights often come with property - they are part of the real estate purchase. They can also be bought and sold like real estate, and if you watch public announcements, there are occasional auctions. Their cost depends on the source of water - it varies greatly.<p>We mostly have focused on getting the property fixed up, and getting animals running over the past 2.5 years. Many people bite off more than they can chew, but I have a rule that we take on one new kind of animal or food procution at a time, and learn it well before adding more. It slows down the process, but I have seen too many people crash and burn by trying to do everything all at once. So for now, we have a flock of chickens that gives us more eggs than we know what to do with. We have bees for honey, and goats, which give us all the dairy we need, as well as some meat and fiber. We have fruit trees. This winter we are getting drop irrigation installed through a few dozen raised garden beds, so our veggie and produce production should be up to speed next year, hopefully. And we may start up a 2nd chicken flock for meat. I expect we have 2 more years of building out our property before we are truly self-sufficient.<p>I work full-time for a single company. We are a SaaS companies that has no office, and everyone works from home. Finding the job was a lucky break, but once I had the job, they could care less where I live, so I found a place I like and moved there. The job has its ups and downs, like any job does, but it is hard to argue with working from home, wherever and whenever you want. That being said, one of the main reasons I am not farther from Provo and SLC is that it is a nice safety net to know that I could get a job and go back to the commuting life if I ever needed to.<p>I go into Provo regularly - it is the closest Home Depot, as well as the closest place for lots of retails shopping and ethnic food. And it is only 15 minutes away, so coming from a larger city, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like much of a trip. But we also do a lot in town - it is not that tiny, over 30K people. There is a movie theatre in town, groceries, ranch stores, some restaurants, etc. We head to Provo probably once a week for other things, up to Orem for a pet store and art supply stores maybe once a month. And Salt Lake? I really thought I would go to Salt Lake more than I do, but I have not been there in a long time. Maybe once a year for an IKEA run, or for a fancy date night with my wife.<p>The biggest drawback is social - living in a small town makes it hard to build up a large group of friends. It is easier on me because I am married with kids, and don&#x27;t need much more than that. You also have less diversity around here. It takes a conscious awareness to try to expose my children to more that the world has to offer.",1444686813

With the NIST seed-hashing technique used to generate these curves, however, only a relatively small number of bits of structure can be forced in the result (assuming no preimage attack on SHA-1, which is still presumed difficult even now, let alone in 1999 when the curves were specified).<p>This more or less makes Jerry Solinas in the thought experiment resort to weakening the curve by forcing the choice into suitably large set of privately-known weak curves (which might only constitute 1 in a billion of the publicly acceptable curves).  However, it&#x27;s not possible for these attacks to insert enough structure for a Dual_EC style private key so they end up weak against all attackers (including other nation states) in theory if they can perform the same analysis.

There was even a gal from Shmoo brought in to make change, but was unable to due to institutional resistance.  Later on, a laptop went &quot;missing&quot; with all staff social security numbers because of the failed ITS mantra of &quot;security is everyone&#x27;s responsibility [and therefore no ones, because it&#x27;s allowed to become a preventable Tragedy of the Commons].&quot;   There were next to no concrete, practical standards (apart from ostensible and vague policies) for securing Windows, Linux, etc. and every pocket of IT did their own thing, without any sort of minimum standard of rigor.<p>Let&#x27;s not also bring up how vendors were allowed to supervise and set vague plans for themselves, waste millions of dollars on many projects, at numerous levels, and not have any material results to show for it.

Talk about historical resonance... I just wanted to further clarify (as the artist who conceived of and built the sculpture) in dialogue with Associated Students of San Jose State University and John Carlos and Tommy Smith that the mandate I received: &quot;To build a sculpture honoring Tommie Smith, John Carlos and Student Activism&quot;. Both John and Tommie are alumni of SJSU. So I wanted to point out, aside from the remarkable courage of John and Tommie&#x27;s gesture, the important role solidarity and camaraderie play in any movement, not to mention it also requiring a particular type of courage. Also I really wanted the sculpture to not be a memorial but an active place. Thus the sculpture becomes a speaker&#x27;s box where anyone - students in particular - is invited to &quot;Step Up and Take a Stand&quot; emulating Peter Norman while these giants, Tommie and John, &quot;got their backs&quot;. I must say it was a joy to meet Peter Norman at the sculpture&#x27;s dedication 10 years ago and get a sample of his great sense of humor. He told me how much he appreciated the sculpture and noted - in between laughs - &quot;People used to look at the photo and say &#x27;Who is the white guy?&#x27;, now they will look at the sculpture and say &#x27;where is the white guy?&#x27;. I ran into my van, grabbed a copy of the poster/photograph and with white-out pen and markers drew a speech bubble inscribed &quot;Where is the white guy&quot; and gifted the poster to him. We both smiled... I guess as two &quot;white guys&quot; who feel strongly about the potential for building alliances across bigotry gaps, without needing to ask for credit.<p>On the second place&#x27;s podium floor it reads &quot;Fellow Athlete Australian Peter Norman Stood Here in Solidarity - Step Up and Take a Stand&quot;.",1444684971

If this were develpeed in an existing Lisp, it would require rewriting the library from scratch. E.g. not using the standard car, cdr, mapcar and so on.<p>Another example is that forms can optionally express Lisp-1 style evaluation for those arguments which are symbols. This is sugared over with square brackets.<p><pre><code>  ;; list is in the function namespace, but resolved
  [mapcar list whatever]
</code></pre>
Implementing this correctly means writing your own code walker; it&#x27;s not just &quot;add a macro and hand off the code to Lisp&#x27;s evaluator/compiler&quot;.  The exact rule is that the closest lexical binding of the identifier is used, whether it is a function or variable; and if there is no lexical binding, then the global one is used. If both a function and variable of the same name exist globally, then preference is given to the variable binding. It doesn&#x27;t end there: symbol macros have to be handled properly: in [a b], a or b or both could be symbol macros. But they get shadowed by function bindings which are lexically inner:<p><pre><code>  (defsymacro ((m whatever))
    (flet ((m () ...))
       (m ...) ;; unambiguously function
       (list m) ;; expanded as symbol macro
       [m ... m ...])) ;; function everywhere 
</code></pre>
Lisp has always been a family of languages. From almost the very beginning, there were numerous dialects. Every major institution that had Lisp activity had its own dialect!<p>It is in recognition of this that the late John MacCarthy expressed his wish that no dialect be just called &quot;Lisp&quot;.<p>Forty years ago you could have said, &quot;if Lisp is go great, why do we have MacLisp, InterLisp, BBN Lisp, ...&quot;<p>Part of the reason Lisp is great is that it teaches programmers to fish.",1444684962

I was reading the paper but not being an expert I could hardly pass beyond the abstract.<p>So if I understand correctly, the idea would be to have only one curve that has been thoroughly examined for weaknesses and then use that curve and only that curve (ideally) in encryption applications, for example for future versions of TLS or whatever other encryption scheme supports elliptic curves.<p>That would avoid introducing potentially exploitable curves to consumer applications, and maybe even make the NSA&#x27;s work harder, right?<p>Now my other question is, I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s no easy way to determine the rigidity of a curve without the proper knowledge and tools, but if there was a way (let&#x27;s say some smart guy managed to make an algorithm to determine the curve&#x27;s weakness) the interested parties could determine the other party&#x27;s curve weakness and negotiate a minimum level? So if you are using a very nonrigid curve then the other party could say &quot;hey, I won&#x27;t send encrypted messages to you unless you use a curve&#x27;s rigidity index > X&quot;. Does this make sense? is this were future consumer encryption is/should be moving?<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m assuming a nonrigid curve can be considered &quot;weak&quot; by your explanation.

There is no &quot;systemd Linux&quot; as such, it&#x27;s systemd/GNU/Linux or Linux with the GNU and systemd suite. Android is a top-down integrated system on the other hand and does not linearly track GNU/Linux.<p>As of yet, there is nothing like system call emulation or similar in nspawn to have branded zones.<p>Nor does Red Hat&#x27;s present actions imply something like this.

As it should be. An init daemon as your container manager sounds dreadful and horrifying, though I hear RancherOS boots from Docker as PID1...<p>But as there is no such init daemon yet nor anything like branded zones, I still have to say you&#x27;re a dreamer.

We backpacked abroad, restored a VW Bus and drove it around the US, and explored the Bahamas on our sailboat.<p>One of my biggest takeaways from our trip - which I think is extremely relevant to the message here - is that my goal will never be to NOT work. Not ever - even in retirement. The consensus strategy of spending 40+ hours of every week of your life saving up so you can enjoy retirement is, to me, a broken model. We met so many people who followed that model only to realize they didn&#x27;t have the health or energy to enjoy all that they had worked a lifetime for. It&#x27;s heartbreaking.<p>Work is a GOOD thing. The preferred solution - and I realize this is a high bar that we&#x27;re beyond fortunate to even consider(more on that at the end) - is to find something you&#x27;re passionate about and you wake up every day wanting to do. Obviously that&#x27;s the old cliche of just doing what you love, but it turns out I&#x27;m one of those dullards who has to learn some of the cliche life-pro-tips through experience to truly understand them.<p>I&#x27;m a solo founder on a business that&#x27;s just entering private beta, so I know first-hand that there&#x27;s an entirely different discussion about delayed gratification and working at an unsustainable pace in the short term to build something meaningful in the long term... and that gets complicated. There&#x27;s no rule of thumb that I know of.<p>I could write a book about this discussion, but in sum: I LOVE codingdave&#x27;s comment, because he used two words that my wife and I ALWAYS use when discussing this: &quot;conscious&quot; and &quot;choices&quot;. These words came up in every discussion we had on our travels when the topic came up. The people we met out there didn&#x27;t get there by accident. They get there because they made choices. They lived below their means. They saved. They learned new skills. They took leaps of faith. VERY few of them were wealthy.<p>When we talk about this, I usually start to say that everything in life is a choice; that we ALWAYS have choices, but the sad reality is that isn&#x27;t true for most people. I won&#x27;t turn this into a political discussion, but will simply say that it would be amazing to live in a world where even the poorest of the poor have palatable choices that they can realistically make. In our current world, those of us who ARE fortunate enough to have some palatable choices can work towards making that a reality. For those that would call that a pipe-dream, there are easily identifiable challenges like affordable childcare that are super-realistic and would go a long way in the right direction. There are amazing organizations already doing great work in that sphere.<p>My business is somewhat tied to this topic.

The idea Bernstein is discussing is (his term) curve &quot;rigidity&quot;. A rigid curve standard can generate only one or a very few curves. A non-rigid generation procedure might generate millions or billions of different curves. That&#x27;s bad news, because it means that corrupt standards bodies can search those billions of curves for one with a weakness that only they know about.<p>The most popular curve standard is NIST&#x27;s. NIST&#x27;s curves aren&#x27;t rigid at all: they start with a random seed. There are as many possible curves you can generate as there are seeds.<p>Now, we&#x27;ve known for a long time that we want rigid curve generation. The second-most-popular curve standard, the Brainpool curves, attempt rigidity. Bernstein doesn&#x27;t like the Brainpool curves. BADA55 criticizes Brainpool and other standards for attempting but not fully achieving rigidity. Most rigidity attempts involve starting from some mathematical constant, like the digits or pi or stuff like that. The basic logic of BADA55 is that there are too many constants and variants on constants to meaningfully constrain curve generation. The good guys will say they&#x27;re starting from pi, and the bad guys will just respond that they&#x27;re using e, the square root of 2, and sin(2). As long as the bad guys can justify a couple million different combinations of constants, they will have enough search space to find weak curves.<p>Since Bernstein doesn&#x27;t know any secret curve vulnerabilities (or isn&#x27;t publishing them), he models curve vulnerabilities by searching for curves that begin with the bytes B:A:D:A:5:5. If you can make &quot;badass&quot;, the logic goes, you can make any evil curve.<p>The historical context of this paper is worth knowing. There&#x27;s an ongoing effort to standardize and deploy Curve25519, Bernstein&#x27;s (very excellent) curve standard. Indeed, it is likely that within a year or two, Curve25519 will be the second-most widely deployed curve on the Internet, because browser vendors appear happy to adopt it (it&#x27;s fast in software, NIST didn&#x27;t produce it, and has many good implementations).<p>But when Curve25519 went to the IETF/IRTF, there was pushback: some people felt the Brainpool curves should be standardized, and Microsoft felt like what should be standardized first should be a &quot;nothing up my sleeves&quot; generation procedure that could produce lots of curves for IETF/IRTF. The debate on the CFRG list was pretty bitter, as was the dialog between Tanja Lange (a Curve25519-associated researcher) and Manfred Lochter (a Brainpool guy) at a recent NIST curve summit.<p>So the updates in this paper include consideration of the Microsoft NUMS procedure, in addition to Brainpool and ANSSI.",1444683860

I was taking 10-20 mg/day and it usually left me feeling totally zonked. (I&#x27;m about 200 lbs) Taking 40 mg was a sure-fire way to spend the day grinding my teeth and babbling frantically.<p>I definitely experienced paranoia, and tended to fixate on things outside my sphere of influence, which lead to feelings of helplessness and despair. At the time I thought I was seeing things more clearly.<p>After a while I realized that while adderal was effective at improving performance in rote tasks, it messed pretty severely with abstract reasoning. I ditched it cold turkey one day and never went back. Surprisingly there were no withdrawal effects. After stopping its use, my grades in university level math and computer science improved dramatically.<p>I now believe that psychiatrists are wrong about prescribing adderal for ADD, and that adderal is not a safe or effective long-term treatment. Frankly, I think the whole field is either in denial, or corrupted by financial incentives.<p>Some people will tell you that you need someone to objectively evaluate your mental state, but I don&#x27;t believe such an analysis is truly possible. Best-case, you&#x27;ll get an educated guess and some good advice. Worst-case, someone will try to prescribe you even more drugs. So before you do that, quit taking speed, and exercise regularly.

But things get dicey when you&#x27;re talking IP: patents and trademarks don&#x27;t trade on the open market but are absolutely vital for a subsidiary to be alive, right?  Amazon isn&#x27;t Amazon if it can&#x27;t call itself &quot;Amazon&quot;.<p>The other trick is to offer some kind of service that&#x27;s difficult to precisely quantify like having an accounting or service center in one country that every foreign subsidiary is required to pay for.  It might not be a reasonable price but the cost of auditing all the call center records to find out it&#x27;s costing $3/minute (on average) for a particular US based company to outsource its support calls to somewhere instead of $0.10/minute is going to be very steep.

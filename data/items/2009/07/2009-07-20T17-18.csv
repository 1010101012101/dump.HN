Which is, after all, what the vast majority of corporate linux contributions are about.<p>The fact that his particular contribution happens to be obviously tactical rather than the more strategic aims of some of the bigger corporate backers doesn't mean that it isn't exactly what we want to see, and entirely in the spirit of commercial open source contributions.<p>If I ever meet any of the people at Microsoft who made this happen at a conference, I have every intention of buying them a beer to say thanks - enlightened self interest is almost always the best way to motivate a corporation to do something useful and I'd imagine the path to making MSFT's self interest sufficiently enlightened to see the advantage of funding this has been a hard one.

But choosing a correct HTTP status code is an important first step because it has well-defined semantics (e.g. caching behavior) for client libraries or proxy software that know nothing about your application, and it allows the client to use a single code-path for all error handling.<p>I was picking on the Posterous API because each response has up to three ""statuses"" - the HTTP status code, the rsp@stat attribute, and the rsp/err@code attribute.  The docs don't even mention what combinations of HTTP status code and response body are valid.  (Will errors be served as 200 OK?  Will some responses have 4XX or 5XX status codes but not have an ""err"" element in the body?)<p>As it is, Posterous clients may need to handle a 200 response with an error in the body, an error response with an error in the body, and an error response without an error in the body (which is not documented in the spec but probably can't be ruled out).  Not all client writers will think of all these cases, and not all will handle them the same.  It would be better for the API to define its behavior in terms of HTTP, which would put all error handling in a single place.",1248112155

I think it's a very sensasionalist, bandwagon-hopping headline, and the majority of economic principles are just as sound now as they were before. The problem lies in their application; too often economic models are being over-simplified for people who are not familiar with their workings, and people without this understanding are making important decisions based on them. The other obvious fundamental problem with economics is that you will never be able to account for everything, and there are some things you won't realise you've missed till you can observe their effects. This isn't economics going wrong, that is how economics progresses. There are plenty of things that can be learnt from recent events, but it's naive to suggest that most post-Keynesian research is suddenly worthless, as was suggested in other articles in that issue.",1248112040

The data structures and data types can be mechanically converted (the Lisp numeric tower if far richer than C++'s numeric capabilities and it might obviate some things) however, it's the numeric algorithms that require expertise to reimplement. A 1:1 translation wouldn't produce an attractive result.<p>By algorithms I mean stuff like the monte-carlo constructors, MakeMCEuropeanEngine, etc.<p>The rest of the stuff would look far more attractive in Common Lisp. deftype can tidy up type definitions. The lisp pretty printer and the format function look way more compact than those huge blocks of cout, etc.<p>One way I can think of is to create C wrappers for C++ and call those wrappers from Lisp. You might have to struggle with Boost, templates and other design patterny crap tacked onto C++ though :-( one way I know is to reify template arguments into function arguments. e.g:<p>new BinomialVanillaEngine<JarrowRudd>(bsmProcess,timeSteps)<p>==><p>binomial_vanilla_engine (JARROW_RUDD, bsm_process, time_steps)",1248111178

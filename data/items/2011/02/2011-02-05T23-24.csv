2184409,comment,2183480,2184382,0,0,gojomo,,,"""Put any results"" is vague, perhaps intentionally finessed, language  – as I (and the Sullivan quote) already highlighted in the grandparent comment. It could mean, especially in the context of the Bing allegations, that Google Toolbar data never adds a new URL to the index or a result-set, but is still used for relative ranking of already-known URLs.<p>In the link you provide, Matt Cutts says: ""I’m not going to say definitively that Google doesn’t/won’t use toolbar data (or other signals) in ranking."" And: ""I’m not going to say whether Google uses a particular signal in our ranking."" Cutts simply says Toolbar data could be problematic because it could be gamed. Well, links can too – didn't stop Google from building its empire on that impure signal. This seems to me more of the same finesse that creates the impression of a denial without a denial.<p>Further, it's clear from previous Google statements that page-load-timing from the Toolbar is used to affect rankings. That alone invalidates the 'strong' interpretation of Amit Singhal's statement. So Singhal means something other than ""Toolbar data never effects search rankings"". What does he mean? Just requoting that vague statement doesn't clear anything up.<p>And since everything Google does with this data is a closely-guarded secret, how can we be sure of anything, short of awaiting (and then trusting) definitive Google statements? And I can't yet find any clear statement about Toolbar data usage – even though lots of people seem to think they have seen them. (I think general warm feelings towards Google are creating this mistaken impression.)<p>I don't expect a clear statement; I believe Toolbar clicktrails are a big part of Google' secret sauce. But it means Google could be using equivalent techniques to Bing's, and simply have better filters against the blatant dominance of a single website or only 20 clickers on any result sets.",1296949619

2184407,comment,2183615,2183615,0,0,jarin,,,"I disagree with the folks who say that contracting your development is ALWAYS bad. I've been doing the development under contract for SetForMarriage.com for over a year and a half, and it's going great (even though I have other client work) because we communicate daily (it also helps that the owner and I were co-workers before). I get pretty considerable leeway to play with features and design (approval is almost always granted), and because of that I really enjoy working on the site.<p>It only took a few months to hit our first thousand users, because the owner of SFM spent a few days compiling a list of contact info for <i>every local news station in the country</i>, bugged them multiple times a week, and used vacation days and skipped college classes to fly out and give live interviews (he works for an airline so his flights are free). I was unsure of his hustling ability before that, but boy did he prove me wrong. Plus, he's funding this whole thing with airline salary and whatever's left over from his student loans.<p>I think the reason the Date or Done guy is so depressed is that he was never able to admit to himself that either the idea was bad or he wasn't hustling in the right ways. It's cognitive dissonance. We didn't spend any time on SEO for Set For Marriage until a few months ago, and we didn't even have a real logo until a couple of months after the site launched. I always hate to see people get so attached to their ideas that they fool themselves. I think when you're in the early stages it's better to be afraid that everything is on the verge of miserable failure but always know that it's in your power to drag it out of the mud into glory (or decide to pull the plug).<p>Also, I really hate to kick a guy while he's down, but if your social website needs a walkthrough there's probably something fundamentally wrong: <a href=""http://dateordone.com/how"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dateordone.com/how</a>",1296949571

2184397,comment,2174722,2178451,0,0,lsc,,,">The equation of cloud vs not cloud is much more complicated than pricing. In fact, I'd argue price is the least impactful component, especially since it's getting cheaper and cheaper.<p>for some parts of some businesses, you are right.  if compute time is a very small portion of your budget, who cares if you pay a little more?   I mean, tools are a vanishingly small portion of my budget, but they are really important to the continued functioning of my company, so I'm willing to pay a very hefty (percentage wise) premium for nice tools.  It's only a few bucks extra, even if it is a 50%-80% premium over the cheap stuff, so who cares?<p>My understanding was that netlfix moved it's cpu to the cloud, for the reasons you stated.  If processing is a small portion of your budget, paying more for hosting of your CPU, and having the excellent flexibility of the cloud might make a lot of sense.<p>My further understanding was that netflix used something else for actual streaming distribution of the movies; amazon wanted too much money for that, and unlike CPU time, bandwidth /is/ a significant cost for Netflix.<p>The parallel in my business is that probably the largest monthly cost of mine is new hardware (followed by power for my existing hardware)  Unlike netflix, my margins on each bit of hardware I get are pretty thin.   An 80% increase in the cost of my hardware would kill me outright.   I put a lot of effort into keeping my hardware (and my power) costs down.<p>(to be clear, moving to amazon ec2 would increase my costs by quite a bit more than 50%-80% - in most cases, ec2 would charge me more wholesale than my customers pay me, retail, for guests.)<p>and I don't know.  Maybe if I started actually selling hardware (which I've considered... I'm pretty good at choosing/assembling, and can do it quite a bit cheaper than Dell's retail prices; the big hangup would be sales.)  and I started spending thousands of dollars a month on tools, I might want to spend more effort getting the cost of tools down.<p>That's the idea behind using standard parts.   A screwdriver is a screwdriver;  I can easily switch brands.    The same, really, could be said for ""unix box on demand"" services like ec2.    It's not that difficult to move from one provider to another, or on to your own hardware, if that makes sense down the road.<p>On the other hand, with the ""proprietary programming environment""  systems like appengine, it may be somewhat more difficult to move off of the system.     (the open-source runtimes may have progressed further since last I looked, but last I looked it was pretty much run it on google, or re-write your code.)",1296949155

When you throw out $45-$65 their going to anchor on the $45 and now you have to move them off of that.<p>Although I suppose if you threw out a really high range that might have the same effect.

I'll justify why I'm charging that, and then let them move me off of it down to what I wanted in the first place. After all, if I said ""$45-$65"" and they paid $60 then they feel like their paying too much (their coming in at $15/hour over what you anchored them on).

So if I ever worked for one, I'd only settle for a market-rate salary, plus equity as a bonus for working ridiculous hours. If you're only going to offer equity, the kind of people who you'd be most likely to attract are (1) young, inexperienced people who have no financial obligations, (2) people who are independently wealthy, or (3) unemployed people who have nothing to lose.<p>As far as your example of hiring an electrician to work on a house you're going to flip: that may have worked well for a few years, but as recent events tell us, the last round of suckers in that game were left with big losses, and the people who worked for them probably never got paid.

2184386,comment,2183480,2183480,0,0,Matt_Cutts,,,"The two major issues in this article were:<p>- Google can see and return links to pages without crawling them. I made a video and a blog post about this a while ago: <a href=""http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/robots-txt-remove-url/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/robots-txt-remove-url/</a><p>- URL paths are case sensitive. Bing blocks /search in its robots.txt but not /Search. That's how the /Search urls got crawled.<p>In a later edit, the author suggests ""It would be fairly trivial for bots to test if the server is IIS (if the server identifies itself as such of course) or to try to retrieve Robots.txt and robots.txt, if those come up as equal then the sever can be assumed to be case insensitive.""<p>The issue of case sensitivity in robots.txt is a long, very nuanced topic. Here's just one example to get you started: at least back in 2007 when we were talking about this amongst ourselves at Google, the web server for developer.apple.com was case-insensitive, but their robots.txt had lines like this:<p>Disallow: /documentation/quicktime/<p>Disallow: /documentation/Quicktime/<p>Disallow: /documentation/QUICKTIME/<p>Disallow: /documentation/macosx/<p>Why would they do that? Apparently because Apple wanted the canonical link to be /documentation/QuickTime . Back then, at least 21M robots.txt files on the web had mixed-case paths. If Google started interpreting robots.txt files from servers that claimed to be IIS differently... well, I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to come up with some of the unexpected bugs and behavior that could result.<p>I know it's really tempting to write a headline like ""Bing search results showing up in Google,"" but I wish the author had done more research instead of going for a gotcha. Any SEO worth his/her salt could have explained what was going on here.",1296948872

Nevertheless, this was a valuable lesson for me:<p>I learned programming on a machine (ZX Spectrum+) which performed syntax checking as I typed. On the other hand, run-time errors often led to crash, making me loose my programs (system had no hard-disk!).  Without me realizing then, it taught me how to write bug-free programs (since penalty for bugs used to be so high).  Yet, with PC-based code editors, my programs have a lot of syntax errors.<p>I realized this when I met someone who could write five thousand lines of code without compiling even once and yet with less than two syntax errors!!  This person was trained by writing programs on paper, and penalty for even syntax errors was set too high.<p>My lesson has been to dislike test-driven development.

I’m saying they need to engineer the app so that it can start showing something interesting in 10 seconds or less — and then keep downloading the rest of the issue, piece by piece, in the background.""</i><p>He's specifically not -- and neither was I -- talking about downloading in the background when the app isn't running: <i>""I realize""</i>, he says, <i>""that iOS has no mechanism that would allow The Daily to have issues download automatically in the background, overnight.""</i><p>Instead, his last two paragraphs are asking for them to ""engineer"" a mechanism to show something quickly and download more after.  He points out other apps that have such a mechanism, and accomplish it in varying amounts of time.  This app also has such a mechanism, but no phrase acknowledges that.  If he knew it was doing that, he could have said, ""Like Flipboard and others, The Daily is downloading most of the issue in the background, but since they already have that mechanism built in, they need to get the new issue's cover shown in 10 seconds instead of 80.""<p>Instead, he says, ""they need to engineer the app so that it can start showing something interesting ... then keep downloading the rest of the issue piece by piece"", as though it weren't already ""engineered"" to do such a thing, just choosing to get too much.<p>As an aside, something's up with his broadband.

He wrote a lot of copy about engineering a mechanism to show something and download more later, without once acknowledging it has such a mechanism already.<p>Final proof I'm not misreading:<p><i>""I noticed yesterday that it took way too long to load the day’s new issue. From the time I tapped the icon on my home screen until I could read a single page, today’s issue took one minute and twenty seconds.""</i><p>No.  At the time you can read a single page, it has <i>not</i> downloaded ""the day's issue"".

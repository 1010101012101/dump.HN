4654838,comment,4653370,4654300,3,0,_delirium,,,"I moved to Europe somewhat recently, and I haven't seen any tolerance or understanding: people are <i>incredibly</i> racist towards anyone with non-white skin, and it's socially acceptable to make snide comments about race in polite society. The U.S. (where I come from) is not exactly a pinnacle of race relations, but I was shocked by how much worse it is in Europe. There was a professor in my department of Bangladeshi heritage, and she got all sorts of weird comments. And as a CS professor, she was obviously not going about committing crimes, but rather writing research papers, but this didn't seem to matter to people.<p>In Denmark, at least, there's also this inaccurate perception, like what you mention, that immigrants are causing all the violence. But here we have basically two main sources of violence: biker gangs, who are mostly white, and immigrant gangs, who are mostly not. The kinds of people who vote Danske Folkeparti and are really worried about crime never seem to mention the biker gangs. Same in the UK: a huge amount of crime in the UK is caused by lower-class whites, the group sometimes derogatorily termed ""chavs"", and overlapping with ""hooligan"" culture. But you don't see the BNP complaining about them. Why? Because that's where their own members come from.<p>Some of my family is Greek, and there is no real tolerance there either, except from a smallish segment of left-wing internationalists. There are 2nd-generation Chinese-origin Greeks who speak perfect Greek and are generally integrated, but are still called racist names and considered ""foreigners"" by the Greeks who have a very ethnic view of Greekness (the majority).",1350305906

(I'm told -- this is purely anecdotal, but comes first hand from a dignosed schizophrenic -- that it makes the voices shut up for a while.)<p>The judge tossed out the mental health argument advanced by the defense. Moreover this case was a <i>public order</i> case, a minor one, but came up before a judge in a crown court (usually the province of serious offenses such as robbery and murder), who imposed a much heavier sentence than would normally be the case for a public order conviction. (Public order offenses are frequently dealt with by a spot fine or, at worst, brought up before a magistrate who has much more limited sentencing powers. It may be that Threw's status -- he was also found to be in breach of a probation order because he was found to be in possession of cannabis -- accounts for that, but: WTF? Four months for possession of cannabis, and another four months for wearing a loud t-shirt in a built-up area? What are we coming to?)<p>Thew is pretty obviously a petty criminal and what, on the internet, we'd term a troll. But his treatment by the state in this case is odious and heavy-handed, and raises disturbing implications.<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/11/manchester-man-jailed-tshirt-police"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/11/manchester-man-jail...</a>",1350305661

4654825,comment,4654251,4654498,5,0,pshc,,,"I think this is largely a myth perpetuated by benchmarks that were faster GC'd than with some system-default badly-tuned malloc. There are gains to be made by copying, generational collectors, and it's impossible to generalize to all workloads, but a basic tenet of optimization is, so they say, that being faster is doing less work. Garbage collectors do a lot of extra work checking the heap, and thrash the cache while they're doing it. Batching a bunch of allocs/frees isn't an advantage exclusive to GC, since any allocator could be easily extended to do the same.<p>And yes games especially are finely tuned to their allocation patterns. Generational collectors somewhat emulate the kinds of region allocation games do. I know I've read war stories about fighting the GC in for example C# XNA games to avoid random stuttering when collection kicks in. For games you'd want some kind of incremental background collector, but these are kind of like ""sufficiently smart"" compilers. They work until they hit the case where they have to fall back to stop-the-world collection.<p>Unless your memory patterns are horribly irregular to the point that they fragment your heap (completely avoided in e.g. console games) and you need to compact memory heavily, non-GC code will just do less work than any type of GC.",1350305628

I started rescheduling my tasks so the most boring ones would get the time of the day I would me most inspired.\nIt helped for a time, but I couldn't stay in the same place for too long.\nAfter some years frequently changing jobs, friends and hobbys, I finally found my place.\nI've been programming since my childhood. Sometimes, ADHD helps (giving ideas on how to solve problems), some other times, it gets in the way, making me lazy to solve some repetitive problems.\nAfter 4 or 5 different jobs, I found one where it doesn't get repetitive. I work in projects that last around six months. Each project uses a different language, with different teams and tools and routines. It's been like heaven.\nAfter I started working here, my whole life improved. I stopped growing tired of people and could finally keep the same friends for a long time. I even started a serious relationship.",1350304667

YOU specifically stated that ""that violent military intervention coupled with Western political soundbites [...] are the real factors responsible for radicalizing elements"", so you ARE knocking the West for everything that happens. I did specifically not label you as anything of the above.<p>>What metrics do we use to calculate which 'side' is more violent? Number of people killed, and number of countries invaded? On that basis the West is clearly far more violent, isn't it?\nI don't think so. How many wars between democratic Western countries vs. between Muslim countries? I do recall Iraqis and Iranians happily gassing each other as late as the 1980s.<p>>Injustice is oxygen for radicals at every strata of society, so my point is that if you serve your subjugated people more justice and less injustice, you are getting increased stability and security in return.\nSure, that's why Western secular countries win this contest hands down. Saudi Arabia is not a US colony, they have a home-grown Muslim theocracy. They are subjugated by their own sheiks and their religion.<p>The West does deserve blame for destroying traditional societies during the 19th century. BUT, those societies were far from peaceful - and contrary to a lot of Asian states, a big part of Africa and the Muslim world never changed their violent ways post-colonialism. The West deserves blame for nurturing dictators like Hussein and Ghaddafi, but it's the Muslim population that - even in more or less free election - votes Islamic radicals into office.<p>I for one are getting irritated and tired of proponents of a peaceful Islam blissfully ignorant of the realities of violence in Muslim societies and Muslim migrant culture.

It means hiding their posts from everyone <i>but them</i>. That's right, if you were hellbanned, you wouldn't know.<p>Read this:<p><a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/suspension-ban-or-hellban.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/suspension-ban-or-h...</a><p>Hellbanning, as opposed to regular banning, a warning system or suspensions, is counterproductive, a giant waste of people's time and frankly condescending towards the userbase.<p>There is <i>nothing</i> that hellbanning (the way it's doled out on HN) solves better than regular bans, suspensions or warnings. And there are a whole lot of things it makes worse.<p>To me the concept of hellbanning always seemed like a real nasty practical joke, something you'd specifically code as a one-off to temporarily trick your worst, most persistent long-time troll.<p>As you use it as a punishment method on everyone, it becomes less effective on actual trolls (compared to regular bans), because a determined troll knows its environment, and knows to occasionally check their account via other means to see if it's been hellbanned. So for that troll, a hellban differs none from a regular ban.<p>Regular users, however, since the mods are not infallible (instead, on HN they are for some ill-thought-out reason <i>invisible</i> and <i>unaccountable</i>), sometimes also get caught in this. Sometimes for little reasons, sometimes they did earn some punishment for ill intentions.<p><i>However</i> when these are not full-time trolls, it becomes really sad to see how it wastes a lot of smart people's time. They can't see they're hellbanned, I've seen some of the poor sods keep on writing comments (that people who did not switch on ""show dead"" cannot see) for <i>over a year</i>. Some of those comments are really thoughtful, as well.<p>When I see such a case, I browse back in their comment history to see what infraction caused their hellban. Often I have to guess, what is their most downvoted comment from just before the time their comments turn grey. As I said, unaccountable. Yes it's usually something very stupid, something that deserves all the downvotes it can get, perhaps some of it might warrant a regular ban,<p>but I have NEVER seen ANY hellbanned user saying something so utterly reprehensible that it would warrant wasting someone's time for <i>over a year</i> that they spent writing comments on HN.<p>The other problem is, it doesn't even notify them that they did something wrong! It's not even a slap on the wrist, they don't notice! It's just stupid.<p>And in the mean time, a determined troll occasionally checks if they can still see their account's comments via a proxy, and if they cannot, they simply register a new account, just as if they were banned via a regular ban.",1350303531

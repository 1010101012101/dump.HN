The densest storage servers you can buy commercially today come from Quanta, and a rack full of them would weigh in at about three-quarters of a ton. “We have a far denser design — it is more than a ton,” Hamilton said.<p>Interesting. For reference; a Backblaze pod is 4U and weighs 145 pounds, so 10 of them in a standard 42U rack would be 1450 pounds = 0.715 (short) tons (or ~648kg).",1384545510

6741751,comment,6740910,6740910,1,0,w_t_payne,,,"I strongly agree with the fundamental point that the author is making.<p>However, there are nuances. A lot of this depends on the type of development that you are doing.<p>For example, most of my day-to-day work is done in very small increments. Minor bug-fixes, incremental classifier performance improvements, parameter changes, and so on. Only rarely will I work on a feature that is so significant in its&#x27; impact that the work-in-progress causes the branch to spend several days in a broken / non-working state. I also work in fairly small teams, so the rate of pushes to Gerrit is quite low: only around a dozen pushes per day or so. This means that integration is pretty easy, and that our CI server gives us value & helps with our quality gating. We can follow a single-branch development path with little to no pain, and because both our software and the division of labour in the team are fairly well organised, conflicts very very seldom occur when merging (even when using suboptimal tools to perform the merges).<p>This state of affairs probably does not hold for all developers, but it holds for me, and for most of the people that I work with. As a result, we can happily work without feature branches (most of the time), and lean on the CI process to keep ourselves in sync & to measure the performance of our classifiers & other algorithms.<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think that Git is great. I am the nominated Git expert in my team, and spend a lot of time helping other team members navigate the nuances of using Git with Gerrit, but for most people it is yet another tool to learn in an already over-complex development environment. Git gives us the flexibility to do what we need to in the environment that we have; but it is anything but effortless and transparent, which is what it really needs to be.<p>Software development is about developing software. Making systems that work. Not wrangling branches in Git.<p>My ideal tool would be the bastard son of Git and a real-time collaborative editor. My unit tests should be able to report when my local working copy is in a good state. Likewise, my unit tests should be able to report whether a merge or rebase has succeeded or failed. Why can I not then fully automate the process of integrating my work with that of my colleagues? Indeed, my work should be integrated & shared whenever the following two conditions are met: 1) My unit tests pass on my local working copy, and 2) My unit tests pass on the fully integrated copy. These are the same criteria that I would use when doing the process manually ... so why do it manually? Why not automate it? Triggered by every save, the resulting process would create the appearance of an almost-real-time collaborative working environment, opening up the possibility for new forms of close collaboration and team-working that are simply not possible with current tools. A source file would be a shared document that updates almost in real time. (If it is only comments that are being edited, then there is no reason why the updating could not actually be in real time). This means that you could discuss a change with a colleague, IRC-style, in the comments of a source document, and make the change in the source file <i>at the same time</i>, keeping a record not only of the logic change, but also of the reasoning that led to it. (OK, this might cause too much noise, but with comment-folding, that might not matter too much).<p>Having said all of that, branches are still useful, as are commit messages, so we would still want something like Git to keep a record of significant changes, and to isolate incompatible works-in-progress in separate branches; but there is no reason why we cannot separate out the &quot;integration&quot; use case and the &quot;collaboration&quot; use case from the &quot;version control&quot; and &quot;record keeping&quot; use cases.",1384545440

There are people who can&#x27;t be rehabilitated, but we never really try so we have no way of distinguishing the repeat offenders who learned but had a moment of stupidity from those who simply didn&#x27;t learn.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/cruel-and-unusual-punishment-the-shame-of-three-strikes-laws-20130327\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/cruel-and-unusual-...</a>",1384544510

It&#x27;s not complex because we don&#x27;t know how to make it simple (that may be true but that is not the real reason), but because politicians explicitly do not want to make it simple. Making it simple would remove a very powerful way to control behavior from them, and if politicians of (almost) all shades hate something equally it is not being able to control something. The tax code is complex because it&#x27;s not only tax code (i.e. means of extracting money from people to fund the government) but a vast regulatory engine.<p>Credit card rewards are complex because competing on price only is hard and brutal and if you&#x27;re dealing with commodities - and credit card access from the issuer side is commoditized - it drives your margins down into unsustainable territory pretty quickly. So people invent all kinds of schemes that they can compete on without getting into direct price competition. I don&#x27;t see how removing this would be a huge net benefit to society. I like getting 2% back from my every purchase and 5% back from certain ones. Yes, I know these are the same 2% the merchant is charged with, but credit card companies won&#x27;t work for free. So I have a choice - either they charge merchants less and don&#x27;t care about me - i.e. don&#x27;t entice me with rewards and so on - or they charge a bit more and give it back to me as a reward.

It&#x27;s not clear to me that it&#x27;s any less maintainable than the alternative.<p>My primary way of achieving reuse, as a developer, is through templating and partials and helpers; they&#x27;re what I use to avoid runaway repetition of styles, which means that redundant Bootstrap class usage isn&#x27;t often a pain point. But keeping classes inline <i>does</i> make it easier for me to debug layout problems at a glance, where relationships between elements are clear. Those classes might not have semantic value to the consumer of the page, but they certainly have semantic value to me. And most of the time, I care more.<p>Large CSS files, even semantic ones, are difficult to maintain, and often give you little feedback on the meaningful relationships that elements have with each other. Pure semantic markup is a myth: web pages are structured documents, and that structure has an impact on style, which is constrained by the limited descriptive power of CSS itself.",1384543724

I guess that makes sense. Fossil Fuels make us pretty unique, doesn&#x27;t it? There&#x27;s a pretty low probability that we&#x27;ll find an energy source more dense and convenient than Fossil Fuel. Things like solar and fission are certainly nice. But if they packed the punch that Fossil Fuels did, they&#x27;d have dominated our economy already!

For example, MD5 does not have any preimage attacks I&#x27;m aware of, but it is possible to create rogue CA certificates that use MD5 [1]. Bruce Schneier estimates that we will see SHA-1 collisions relatively soon [2], so it&#x27;s not like Microsoft is just making this stuff up.<p>I agree that CA compromise is a serious problem, but it&#x27;s not one Microsoft can do something about. They <i>can</i> ban SHA-1 in certificates, and I think it&#x27;s a good idea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/when_will_we_se.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/when_will_we_...</a>",1384542106

So, for example, if you order a product with a credit card, and the retailer goes bust before supplying it, the credit card issuer is also liable. If you&#x27;d bought it with a debit card, you&#x27;d be out of luck.<p>Finally, if your card details are compromised, you&#x27;ve slightly longer to sort things out with a credit card: with a debit card, you could find yourself with no cash at all.<p><a href=""http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/shopping/section75-protect-your-purchases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/shopping/section75-protect-...</a>",1384542054

39800,comment,39611,39657,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Design isn't an exception to most other talents. The way to get good is to do it. It helps to know how to make things, from paper prototypes drawn freehand to more serious tools.<p>Also, from a usability perspective, there are a number of tools people use. Lots of them boil down to ""figure out why people can't use this or think it's ugly"". But i'm no expert.<p>Also, it helps to have a sense of aesthetics. That usually comes when you admit something is ugly, and grows from there.<p>There are a ridiculous number of design books out there. You could probably finish ""Laws of Simplicity"" in an hour.\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Laws-Simplicity-Design-Technology-Business/dp/0262134721"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Laws-Simplicity-Design-Technology-Busi...</a><p>Note that I'm no designer.",1186420446

Get your MIND OFF RUBY and think about that HOT WAITRESS you have been dying to ask out on a date. Imagine being on a date with her and start SMILING, I promess you will  go to sleep within 15-30 minutes.",1186419987

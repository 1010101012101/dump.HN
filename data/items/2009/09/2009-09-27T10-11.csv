Why doesn't someone (who knows a lot more than me, or I'd do it myself) start a Amazon Associates bookstore with books for hackers?  I would definitely be interested in that.  If anyone knows of something like that, or a good hacker study guide, maybe leave a link?  Before someone recommends it, I've already seen esr's ""How to Become a Hacker"" <a href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</a> .  I'm looking for more practical programming study that would be useful for hackers and programming.",1254049058

846750,comment,846357,846732,0,0,billswift,,,"I said nothing at all about anyone being cretins; sounds like you are being a bit defensive.  The post I was responding to said specifically that he used scores as ""which comments to keep an eye on"" and to avoid ""getting lost in the text"".  But actually reading the text is the only way to absorb the information.  The biggest problem I have is with following a comment back to its reference when there are a lot of intermediate comments - allowing comment levels to collapse, like emacs outline mode, would help.",1254048631
846749,comment,846579,846579,0,0,Mz,,,"I'm reminded of an episode of MASH where Burns tries to get Hawkeye in trouble.  Hawkeye is playing cards.  Burns feels he should be in surgery.  But he is waiting for the patient to be stabilized.  He had ordered the kid get IV fluids, whole blood, and antibiotics so he wouldn't die on the operating table.  He is playing cards (without drinking, for a change) to keep himself up so he will be awake and alert when it is time to operate in the middle of the night.<p>There are two kinds of ""hard work"":  The type where you are busy and putting out continuous effort and the kind where the hard part is resisting stupid suggestions from other people, resisting what the crowd is doing, resisting temptation and so on to stick to your guns and do things the right way.  That kind of work may not look like hard work to outsiders but in some ways can be harder than looking like you are working hard.  I have found that second category of hard work to be more productive and valuable than the first.  The first is more about appearances and about reassuring ourselves we are ""working hard"".  The second is about doing the right things at the right time.  It often involves a lot less physical effort and therefore often looks like ""slacking"" and ""luck"" to outsider observers when it is neither.",1254048553

846745,comment,846365,846492,0,0,jmtulloss,,,"actually, no. As I understand it, the language was supposed to be some sort of weird conglomeration between traditional object oriented languages and dynamic, lisp-ish languages. The problem was that the creators had about 30 seconds to get this done and they could make things look more ""normal"" by not explicitly supporting every feature they envisioned.<p>""new"", I believe, is actually an ancient relic of the prototypal class system. That's another topic entirely, but it's incredibly cool. Check out Douglas Crockford's articles on inheritance if you want closure on the issue. He has written way more than I have on the topic.",1254047819
846744,comment,845699,846340,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"There's a few misconceptions here, first, though kind of off-topic but you <i>can</i> pay people to produce Free Software, lots of people do.<p>Two other misconceptions: He didn't call anyone a ""traitor"" for producing proprietary software, nor did he call anyone a ""traitor"" for stopping producing free software. That's kind of the point of using that specific word as it wouldn't apply in those circumstances though some people seem to be taking it as just a general insult.<p>He did use the word to describe someone who used to be a leading light of the Free Software movement. Remember de Icaza is the guy who started Gnome because the QT licence meant that KDE wasn't ""free"" enough, even though it was open source i.e. what most folks round here would call a Free Software zealot.<p>He's now, amongst other things that the FSF find dubious, advising a project specifically set up to create open source software which <i>isn't</i> copyleft with the clearly stated aim that it can be used in proprietary software. This is promoting Open Source (though only as a subordinate of proprietary software) but not Free Software which, for some people, is a very important difference.<p>If you don't understand that you could dedicate your life to  the business success of <i>open source</i> and not impress Richard Stallman then you might want to read this:<p><a href=""http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.h...</a>",1254047741

846736,comment,846518,846518,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Seems entirely built around the straw man argument that Free Software doesn't want to interoperate with standards created by proprietary companies.<p>I'm not sure you could be any more wrong about something, unless you were actively trying to do so. Even then it would take effort and a certain twisted kind of mad genius. Just seems to come naturally to Matt Asay though, he can churn this nonsense out week after week.",1254046567

846729,comment,846579,846723,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I've been thinking about this exact thing for many years now. During that time, I've had a few web startups that did not succeed -- even though I worked like the dickens on them.<p>There are two types of people in the world: people who think that success is due to learning and work and people who think that success is due to luck.<p>The side-effects of these belief systems are very important.<p>If you think success is due to hard work and knowledge, you are likely to work hard and keep learning. If, on the other hand, you think it's luck, you are likely to resent those who are luckier than you and to feel like success is a rigged game.<p>I think you can err too much on either side here. What's the truth? The truth is that you can learn and work and increase your chances from 1 in a million to maybe 1 in a hundred. Perhaps better. Given these odds, some folks try a few times and make it. Some try once and make it. Some try dozens of times and don't make it. Usually looking back, as you point out, the story is about skill and hard work, even though luck probably had a lot (but not all) to do with it.<p>You can look at this as a reason not to work or try hard, or you can look at this maturely as simply the way life is played. Personally I think the best strategy is to balance learning/working with increasing the frequency of your startup attempts. If you could fail a dozen times in one year, within ten years you're likely to do well. [insert black swan reference here]",1254045706

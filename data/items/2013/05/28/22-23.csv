Wicherts does a lot of research on this issue to try to reduce the number of dubious publications in his main discipline, the psychology of human intelligence.<p>""With the emergence of online publishing, opportunities to maximize transparency of scientific research have grown considerably. However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.""",1369781130

It looks ridiculous to wear a suit jacket when the next few layers of your management chain are wearing board shorts and sandals.<p>Instead, the ideal seems to be to tread a fine line between casual wear and formal wear. Properly fitted clothing is important here- a suit is too formal, loose jeans a bit sloppy, but dark jeans that are tailored to fit are perfect.<p>This makes shopping in the women's section very difficult- I usually find casual-wear for women a bit inappropriate for work (clothing is often too sheer and unlined, too clingy, or necklines too low), and clothing marketed as office-wear would make most assume I was a secretary or in advertising/human resources/ect. A mixture seems to work well. Rather than dressing up casual clothing, I find more success dressing down nicer pieces. For example, a nice dress with a denim jacket or a silk blouse with jeans and flats.<p>My male friends seem to have a similar problem shopping, in which clothes that are made for casual wear are more casual than they would like, but then there is a huge gap from casual to much too formal.

There seems to be a huge influx of things like this: books on how to sell books or build apps after their ""real book"" or ""real app"" failed to sell, sites for vetting ideas built by people whose ""real idea"" was bad, customer development tools for people who failed to do good customer development with their ""real idea"".

As if it is a given that a) there must be daily meetings, and b) they must be <i>defined as rules</i>.  I would rather we focused on the goal instead: The dev team must be coordinated, and they must not deviate enormously from the schedule without the project manager at least knowing about it.<p>So here's our process for ensuring this:<p>Nothing.<p>It turns out that when you have skilled and motivated people working without process handcuffs, they are able, and actually eager to <i>self-organize</i>.<p>- How do we keep in touch?  We set up a HipChat room where we discuss things both on and off topic asynchronously.  Is our process ""we will use a chat room for daily chitchat""?  No.  We use it because it makes sense, and when it stops making sense, we do something else instead.<p>- How do we catch one dev needing help?  He says so.  Then we can meet up and pair program or discuss the issue or whatever makes sense.  Do we have ""pair programming tuesdays"" to enforce this?  No.  It just happens when it needs to.<p>- How do we make sure one dev doesn't drift off procastinating for two weeks?  Turns out that's not really a relevant problem for us.  We find that skilled devs given freedom and responsibility will live up to it.  But on the off chance that it happened, we <i>would</i> notice the lack of work flowing from checkins and code review and work tasks.<p>- How do we make sure the project manager knows of any problems?  We tell him.  Simple as that.  And usually on the way to luch, he asks ""things going ok?"" and we answer ""yep"" or ""slightly behind it seems, we might delay task X till next week"".  Do we have a ""pre lunch meetup"" process to define this?  No.  It happens naturally because <i>we all have a desire to cooperate</i>.<p>- How do we make sure the devs don't shit in the sink while on the bathroom?  We <i>could</i> have a process in place with a post-bowel-movement checkup rota.  Or we could enforce pair toiletgoing with a senior architect.  But we decided not to.

They were talking about this publicly as far back as the Xbox 1 (the former Xbox 1, now known as the Xbox 1 that isn't the Xbox One) in the 2001 time frame.<p>I'm fine with that strategy and even encourage it, but as a gamer I'm distraught with other decisions they <i>seem</i> to have made (it is impossible to tell what decisions they've actually made from rumors or misreporting because they are failing on the PR/messaging for specifics of the Xbox One on a spectacularly epic scale currently).<p>In the long run, the Xbox 360 is kind of the odd duck of the Xbox line in terms of hardware architecture considering the old Xbox 1 was x86 based and basically a closed PC, just like the new Xbox One.  Of course, the 360 happened to occur over the time period that Live proved that a full online experience for a console should be considered an essential component.  (I just wish they'd stop raising the cost of Live while also increasing the amounts of ads it throws at you (without raising the value to suit), and stop charging for things that are free elsewhere (eg. Netflix, etc), and start using some of the mountains of money they earn from Live to provide dedicated gaming servers, etc).<p>The Wii U is actually a pretty nice device.  I have one.  I'll buy pretty much any system Nintendo puts out just to play their first party games, at least until they're forced to go the route that Sega did.   But anyway, the remote touchscreen gamepad ""second screen"" thing is pretty cool I love using it for Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Instant.  Being able to redirect the video play to the gamepad device's screen when the TV is otherwise in use is really nice, and it really makes things like searching a breeze compared to using a more traditional remote.   Yes, you can achieve the same basic sorts of things with other consoles plus an external device like a tablet via things like SmartGlass, but with the Wii U it Just Works without having to dick around with anything.",1369779485

It's impossible to calculate the true costs of an externality like ""air pollution"", therefore any number that the government chooses is arbitrary and unjust.<p>2. When an externality can be defined concretely as in ""Action by person A harms person B or her/his property"", then B can sue A to stop it and get compensated (e.g., a factory dumping chemicals to someone's land).<p>3. On the other hand, it's unreasonable for people to individually identify and sue car owners, therefore the best solution is to privatize roads, and then the road owner would be liable for the pollution, so he would have an incentive to raise prices or ban high polluting cars.<p>That said, this is not necessarily the position of the CATO Institute; I'm not sure where they stand.",1369779116

You could probably negotiate a cheaper rate from the providers as well since you'd be presumably paying for hundreds of accounts.<p>Why should I pay for all the services when I'm only using one at a time?

I read your entire post, you mentioned that you were pivoting yet you failed to capture my attention or interests by not expanding on what the idea was. You also concluded your post without giving me an option to signup for your emails, I thought the post was done so I stopped reading at the thanks for reading section, which I didn't read. Only going back I saw that there was a signup box all  the way at the bottom - if you want me to signup for your emails, make it easy for me to do so, don't make me hunt.

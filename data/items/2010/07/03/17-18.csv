1484143,comment,1483831,1484080,0,0,thwarted,,,"I don't mind things having their own packaging solutions, because it does get over a hurdle of trying to use things that have broken or non-existent package management systems (I'm looking at you Windows and OSX).  What I do mind is when there's not an obvious way to work with the language's provided packaging system to make rpms or debs.  Or the language's packaging system actively works against other packaging systems because it's, uh, ""unpythonic"" or it's just not way it's done in <i>our</i> environment because we're special.  The whole idea of a ""this is a pythonic packaging system"" seems to say ""all other previous packaging systems python has used have been unpythonic"", which wasn't the case when the previous packaging systems were released -- everyone claims theirs is the best.  It's good to have the ability to install things without the system packager (say, in another directory for testing or development purposes), but when it comes time to productionize something, the language's library management needs to work <i>with</i> the system packager.<p>I think ruby is especially bad in this regard.  There's some mindset that seems to say everything should be manageable as if it was a gem, even if it wasn't installed via gem.  gem seems to be used to manage dependencies within the library itself, which breaks if the library itself isn't managed with gem.  So you sometimes need to fake it (admittedly, I have not installed ruby libs in a while, but I had to make <a href=""http://github.com/thwarted/gem2deb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/thwarted/gem2deb</a> to make this mildly more manageable, but that's still only a 90% solution and that last 10% is particularly annoying).<p>perl is an example of one that gets it close.  In most cases, you can do the build and stop before the install.  Then the contents of the blib directory are the entire contents that needs to be installed, so you can just package that up -- this makes it compatible with all popular system packaging systems.  And even then, we have cpan2rpm that does the heavy lifting of scripting finding the package on CPAN.<p>Package management is pretty much a solved problem, and it's solved for the general case of putting files in place and asserting (and resolving) dependencies -- assuming all the dependencies are packagable/available in packages (which is easy to achieve if things can be easily packaged).  If you think you need more than that, it might be time to revisit how your libraries are written and how your language uses libraries.  If it's anything more than ""are the files in a place where the language can find them"", it may be time to revisit it.",1278179999

1484131,comment,1483812,1483924,0,0,gruseom,,,"I don't think it's subliminal. The issue isn't the technical meaning of ""consumer"" but the fact that it has replaced ""citizen"" as the default for referring to human beings in our society. Humans walk, but one would never hear ""What does this mean for walkers?"" in a news item, unless of course it were a news item about traffic or something.<p>The implication of this usage of ""consumer"" is that consumption isn't just something we do, it's what we are. That is deeply fucked. I couldn't care less about the political agenda of everybody-should-consume-less, but the idea that humans' primary role in society is not to be active members of a polity (the meaning of ""citizen"") but rather essentially to eat things, is a violation of our best traditions and intuitions. We are called to more than that.<p>The replacement of ""citizen"" with ""consumer"" is as significant as the replacement of ""subject"" with ""citizen"" was in the first place.",1278179602

Being egotistical is in most cultures regarded as a vice. It is easy to love oneself. Also you are being ungenerous with regards to the abilities of others around you.<p>Always assuming that you fall short of the median appears to be a conscious exercise in humility. Being humble is usually regarded as a virtue. Being humble is not so easy, cuz if it were the world would be a hell of a different place. The problem with this approach is that you are being ungenerous towards yourself and your own hard-won abilities.<p>But you know, there is a difference between assuming you are one thing or another and how you project yourself to the world. I would imagine that what is most difficult is accurately and generously assessing your own ability (in different situations) and also fairly and generously assessing the abilities of others. What is important then is that if you find that you are ""better"" than someone at whatever that you are humble about it and that if you are ""worse"" that you are not envious about it.<p>In short Derek I believe that you have swung from one extreme to another and shot past the more difficult happy mean.<p>I also believe that there are any number of false dichotomies at play here.

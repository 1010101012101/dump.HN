55334,comment,55308,55308,0,0,cstejerean,,,"As far as Blockbuster's no late fee policy, it definitely worked. I stopped renting from competitors. Even if you keep a title for more than 7 days past the due date and you get charged for it, you still have 30 days to return it for a full refund minus the $1.95 (i believe) restocking fee. This is far better than keeping something for a couple of days past the due date in most other places.<p>But I agree with the rest, while I would like to see awesome offers with no fine print chances are I might not believe them. The ""it's too good to be true"" policy has worked out too many times for me in the past to start ignoring it all of a sudden.",1189968555

55332,comment,55325,55325,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I'm not sure that I agree with the article. Perhaps Apple would have higher market share if the Macs were sold in more retail locations but I think this might drive customer satisfaction down. IMO Apple wants to control the distribution channel in order to create the right customer experience. I was amazed for example at how easy it was to purchase an iPhone and sign up for the service compared to the usual hassle of buying and activating a phone.<p>What I'd like to see (if anyone has any links, please do share) is the percent market share between licensed copies of Windows and licensed copies of OS X.",1189968258

As I grow and experience more, being a business owner, etc... It seems that no matter how much one human knows or thinks they know- there is almost always another human who knows something else and that something else just might be what the first person needs to know.

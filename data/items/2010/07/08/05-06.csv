1496597,story,,,7,10,AgentConundrum,"I may have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and I'd appreciate some advice. (Long Post)",,"Even though I'm looking for general advice, I'd like to go over my situation in detail to minimize the chances of being offered advice that could further injure me. I therefore apologize for the length of this post. I understand that you folks aren't doctors, and nothing you say is medical advice. I'm here because this community is probably at a higher risk than average for this sort of injury, and so there's a better chance of hearing from people who have lived through this here than elsewhere.<p>Anyway, a couple weeks ago I started getting pain in my wrist while I was typing. I managed to get an appointment with my family doctor for a week later, but because of the pain and my fear of doing more damage, I opted to go to a walk-in clinic I've been to a number of times previously.<p>The doctor at the clinic seemed to assume it was most likely Carpal Tunnel Syndrome just based on the fact that the pain was in my wrist. He had me flex my wrists (Phalen's Maneuver) and tapped on the underside of my wrist (Tinel's Sign) but neither of these tests really did anything to me - there was no pain or tingling present in either case (NB: When I try Phalen's now, I feel a bit of pressure in the underside of my wrist, but that's it).<p>The doctor told me to get a wrist brace, and specifically told me to get one made for CTS. He told me that a lot of people flex their wrists into odd positions in the middle of the night, so I should wear the brace when sleeping and when typing. I looked this up later, and there are mentions online about CTS sufferers mangling their wrists like the doctor said, and that this can present as waking up with your hands numb/asleep. I had noticed this a few times recently, so things seem to line up there.<p>After looking at various models in the drug store and discussing the situation with a girl who worked there, I eventually purchased a relatively expensive model (http://www.amazon.com/M-Brace-Wrist-Splint-Size-Regular/dp/B000X9SUKA). I wore this brace home that day, and have generally worn it when typing since then and always while sleeping.<p>Things seemed to be improving until I went to my doctor the following week. At my appointment, my doctor did hardly anything to check on my condition, except trying Tinel's again (no symptoms presented during this test this time either). He examined the brace and had me put it on, and he said it was good. The point, he said, was just to limit the range of movement for my wrist, and that the brace did its job just fine. He asked me why I wasn't wearing it when I came in, and I told him that I only really wore it to bed and while on the computer. He told me I should be wearing it all the time, but that I could take it off to sleep (which struck me as horrible advice, given what I had researched). He told me I should wear it all day, and through the night if I wanted, for maybe the next week or 10 days, which I've mostly done. I asked him if that was a bad idea since I had read that leaving the brace on all the time could weaken the muscles, but he said that that only occurred over the long term, and a week wouldn't do any damage.<p>After wearing the brace all day for several days, I started noticing that the base of my thumb was stiff/sore and the area around my pinky was sort of the same. Everything else felt more or less ok, so I started not wearing the brace through the day, thinking that maybe the brace was constricting my thumb too much. Things have been pretty good for the last couple of days, but there's still lingering... awareness, I guess. I'm aware of a bit of a strain in my wrist/forearm (and there's a tingle in my elbow sometimes) from time to time, but it's mostly alright. In fact, I've typed this entire post without the brace mostly without pain. There is some noticeable strain, but by taking a lot of mini-breaks it's very manageable. I'm also aware that I shouldn't be pushing this hard, but I wasn't really expecting to write quite this much.<p>Another factor seems to be that I'm typing sitting upright on my smaller couch, with ample room for my right arm (the pained one). Normally, I type lying down on my other couch while watching TV or just relaxing, and my right arm can sometimes get pinned a bit. Another factor I think is probably relevant is that not terribly long before I started getting the wrist pain, my elbow/shoulder would feel a bit cramped while lying down and typing. I moved the pillow beside me out of the way and that seemed to help the issue. For this reason I'm wondering if I might have pinched a nerve or something which is helping cause these issues.<p>Before it's mentioned, I know that my ""laying on the couch"" arrangement isn't good for me, but it's a habit that formed out of convenience. I don't have a good desk chair (and even my cheap piece of crap chair is broken to the point that my posture would suffer), so I don't really use my desk anymore (I really never have since I got this laptop three years ago).<p>I'm currently unemployed (one year today!), so money is extremely tight right now. This means that I consider a lot of typical fixes (better desk, better chair, laptop dock with ergo-keyboard and trackball mouse) are hard for me to considr out of financial concerns.<p>The one expenditure I am considering is massage therapy. There is a school across the road from my apartment that only charges $27 per session, so I think I could talk myself into paying for a single session to see if it'll work out any pinched nerves I might have.<p>I have a few questions regarding the ""free"" fixes I can try:<p>* I've been taking a lot of Ibuprofin as an anti-inflammatory on the advice of my doctor. For the last couple of days, I've been taking two pills right before bed on the assumption that if my body does most of its healing while asleep, then the anti-inflammatories would do the most good if they reduced inflammation during periods of increased healing. Is this an accurate assessment, or is this more likely to be a placebo?<p>* Regarding icing, I've read a number of different options for this (rubbing ice directly on the wrist until the skin is pink to promote bloodflow, icy dips followed immediately by hot dips and repeated several times, gel packs, etc.). Is there a ""best way"" to go about icing? How often should I be icing the arm?<p>* Regarding stretching, am I risking damage by stretching (see http://lifehacker.com/5195481/exercises-that-protect-against-carpal-tunnel-syndrome) while the condition persists, or should I wait until the pain has dissipated via rest before beginning a stretching regimen?<p>* I lead a pretty sedentary lifestyle at the moment, but I've been thinking that cardio is likely a great idea since increased bloodflow would likely promote healing in the wrist. I'm told that the wrist, being a smaller tunnel, doesn't always have the best bloodflow, which is partly why wrist injuries like this can take so long to heal. Does this seem like a good idea? I'm thinking of walking all the way up the stairwell in my building (it's 9 stories to the top from my apartment) and back down.<p>* I've heard that the electrical nerve tests (or whatever they're called) are extremely painful, but would they be worth it to determine if this really is carpal tunnel? If the problem is carpal tunnel, I've heard that the surgery is pretty much batting 1000 in terms of permanently ending the pain. If the nerve conduction tests show carpal tunnel, should I get the surgery as a preventative measure? What's recovery like?<p>Sorry for the extremely long post, but I'm extremely worried about my present condition. I'm only 25 years old and I'm terrified that I'm going to end up unable to work or go back to school because of this issue. Just writing this post has been incredibly theraputic to me, especially since it hasn't been particularly painful to write (though there are pre-cursor signs in my wrist, so I should really rest a bit after this).<p>Thank you so very much for any advice or anecdotes or support you can provide!",1278567809

Moving from iPhone to Android to WM7 might end up costing the average person $50 in apps over a period of years. One really good WM7 handset could totally change the market.<p>Personally I see the Android market is on track for much less diversity in the future. HTC and Motorola seem to be the only companies doing a really good job with Android. The big problem with Android is your handset maker can cut corners and give you a terrible product. Google doesn't do a whole lot to support OEMs besides a link to the source code and words of encouragement. Microsoft has lots of experience as an OEM software partner. The license fee may end up being a reasonable price for handset makers to pay to avoid some of the difficulty of developing an Android device.",1278567407

Cancer typically arises when genetic mutations cause a cell to exhibit uncontrolled and sustained division. Our cells experience thousands of mutations a day, most of which are fixed. Some of these inanimate objects may upon being metabolized or coming into contact with a cell, cause mutations. With more mutations, you are at a higher risk for one to go unrepaired and lead to something other than cell death. Colloquially, I understand we refer to certain things as causing cancer but I think the idea of grouping everything into discrete boxes isn't really something worth pursuing in this case.",1278566952
1496577,comment,1495415,1496532,0,0,kenjackson,,,"My bad.  Trying to be cute.  Let me actually attempt to give a little evidence, since you claim to have none.<p>First, if you think MS has no core competency or that software is not one of them, then we could end the discussion right here.<p>But otherwise, it seems clear to me that mobile OS software is among their core competencies.<p>I start with the premise that operating systems are one of their core competencies.  They have sold more units of OSes than any other company (or among the top 3).  They employ probably the most renowned set of OS experts (David Cutler, of Vax VMS and NT fame.  Rick Rashid, who did mach, the kernel that OS X is built on, Butler Lampson and Chuck Thacker, Turing Award winner for their work in operating system.  Leslie Lamport, etc...).<p>Now you may say, ""but they have no experience with mobile OSes"".  Except they were one of the first companies to do a mobile phone operating system.  They also do operating systems for kiosks, embedded systems, and of course desktops and servers.<p>And while Windows Mobile is not a popular OS, the reason is not the OS itself.  It's the shell that is problematic.  The underlying OS is solid, and is being used in Windows Phone 7.  They need a new shell and app deployment model, but they aren't going in and ripping out the kernel.  And from people who have used it, they say the OS in WP7 is snappy.<p>IMO the company has 3 core competencies: OSes, Dev Tools, and Business Productivity sw.  They have some secondary ones: Online Services and Video Gaming.<p>In summary, I think for them to give up in a space where they've actually produced a solid code base over the past decade, just when the space is now showing it can generate profit seems absurd.",1278566898

1496554,comment,1495755,1495755,0,0,sbaqai,,,"I think the problem with areas like architecture and industrial design is, there is no clear performance metric for what is considered ""good design"" - or at the least, what designers consider good isn't completely aligned with what users consider good.<p>The switch designer in this case was overly focused on aesthetics and his own cleverness, rather than on making a ""good"" switch. The fact that you'd need directions on how to use it makes it a horrible switch. It fails its most primitive task, which is to be identified as a switch. Secondly, you can't tell how it works just by looking at it. And to ignore the iconography of something utilitarian like a switch, is a bit self-indulgent. Here, design gets in the way.<p>This is a problem with design education, which turns people into cake decorators rather than problem solvers. The entire science of how-things-work is ignored and worse still, not even considered as a source of inspiration.  Instead, you get perversions similar to that of the post-modern literary crit world. Designers talking amongst designers, giving each other awards, and curating some new form of design-incomprehensible to outsiders.<p>And this leads to the false dichotomy between form and function. Almost like art vs. engineering. You get students who study design, who have no interest in how things work. And you get engineering students who don't understand that products are experienced in layers - you have first impressions and expectations, recognition of what it does/how to use it, perceiving of quality (would an iPod feel cheaper if it was lighter?), durability, etc. and that process must be managed/controled via design.<p>I sometimes think studying bridges is a better way to learn about design than studying architecture. You can't ever ignore the fact it has very real constraints. And yet, there are tons and tons of beautiful bridges. Every component must be functional AND aesthetic. A designer is the engineer and the engineer is the designer. You get a very ""fat-free"" structure. Different bridges have different experiences. And they never get in the way of you driving across them either.<p>James Dyson gave an awesome talk about this at MIT, called ""The Art of Engineering"". I definitely recommend watching it if you see engineering and art as one: <a href=""http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/</a>",1278566173

Still waiting for an all-around better device and network setup for my usage pattern (messaging/emailing a lot, talking a lot, maps, occasional web browsing).<p>While the T-Mobile coverage has sucked plenty in certain areas, I've had nearly 3 years of satisfaction that if there's a wifi network, I have coverage -- in various apartments where coverage sucked, deep inside work buildings (where other service providers also can't penetrate), at other people's houses where there isn't great coverage... and it costs me nothing.  Unlimited calls/data/messaging w/ UMA included: ~$90/month.  Plus I can tether!<p>Anyone know if T-Mo is baking UMA support into any upcoming Android devices?",1278565816

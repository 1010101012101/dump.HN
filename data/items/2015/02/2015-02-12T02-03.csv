Exactly true, and often forgotten.<p>It&#x27;s useful here to distinguish between conversions and casts. Conversions use type information to ensure computations remain sensical; the canonical example is a conversion between integers and floating-point values which makes sure you never end up feeding invalid bit patterns into the relevant arithmetic hardware. An example of a cast is taking a bit pattern you <i>had</i> been treating as an integral value and then telling the language it&#x27;s a floating-point value, and there not being an error at that point.<p><i>Conversions don&#x27;t break the type system; they use the type system.</i> Casts throw types away.",1423709475

I&#x27;m not taking sides at all, just pointing out the history of the past couple hundred years.<p>China is like any other state, in fact it was literally the first instance of the Modern State that had centralized authoritative systems of governance that provided various facilities throughout the Empire, mandated by the emperor. Heck we have one of the first instance of the fiat currency being used in China, which in itself shows the internal stability of the Chinese state. Not to mention their vastly superior ability to mitigate famine throughout the country. Europe during all this lacked tremendously. For instance during the 18th century enlightenment era millions of people died due to famine, and other hunger related diseases in Europe, whereas in China during the same time period we see the Qing successfully provide millions of peasants with precious grains, and intelligently rationing them out through centralized sources. This was the norm in China. Compared that to the blunders of the later Qing, and infamous Mao. It&#x27;s astounding how far China has come.<p>China being more violent than the West is bullshit. Both where at least equally violent. All states are violent. They require violence, and coercion. Well actually we can&#x27;t really forgive the British literally starving the Indian population, by deliberately instating rules that caused millions of people to starve to death, while exporting record amounts of grains to Britain. Oh yes. The West wasn&#x27;t that violent, or cruel...<p>The myth is that the West had technological superiority compared to other nations, and built their empire from that technology, but that really doesn&#x27;t cut it. What the West was able to do is exploit that technology to create a new economic system, you know, globalization. Many nations had similar technologies, except the West&#x27;s ability to politically maneuver regions in their own favor, and thereby exploiting that region to export trade goods back home is what actually made them incredibly successful. This export starved other nations, countries, and kingdoms, both literally, and metaphorically of various other prosperities. This exporting of goods is what drove the British, and the Imperial powers in general, and what produced a wealthy economy in those countries. Eventually draining away so much wealth from those regions that we see the effects to this day.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that West was either more, or less violent than any other nation in history, just pointing out what happened in the recent past, and what continues to happen even today.<p>Furthermore it&#x27;s an assumption to think that conflict creation is inherent in human beings, because it&#x27;s really not, and there are many instances of various government being satisfied in their own domains. China, and India being an example where incredible wealth meant a stable state, and that stability was satisfying to those population that actively pursuing conflict for even more wealth would be seen as idiotic. They knew they had more than enough. The West knew they were beggars, and so they conquered. The continued exploitation through conflict is not a preferred method of existence, as we are seeing with the USA.",1423709275

Yeah, it&#x27;s hard to hire an engineer in Silicon Valley for peanuts.  But there&#x27;s no god given right to be able to hire cheap labour, and if you really want to hire someone, pay the market rate, or stop whining about it.<p>I&#x27;m also not thrilled by the email he sent the student.  I feel like communicating with students outside of class time is absolutely part of the job of instructor; his email reads to me like someone saying &quot;I&#x27;m not paid enough to do the entire job I was hired for&quot;.  That wouldn&#x27;t fly in any other context.  If he decided to just not show up to some lectures he was hired to teach, what would the university say if he told them he wasn&#x27;t being paid enough to attend every class?  He may be dealing with a shitty deal from the administratio, but passing it along to those even weaker than him is hardly admirable.<p>Now, despite my tone above, I am sympathetic.  He&#x27;s doing a crap job for little pay.  I have empathy for him!  But he&#x27;s the one who signed up to do a crap job for little pay, and keeps signing up to do it again every year.  And that makes him part of the problem.<p>Ultimately, there&#x27;s only so many teaching slots available, and there&#x27;s a fuckton of Phd graduates desperate to obtain one regardless of the salary or employment terms.  Doubling the salary won&#x27;t increase the number of teaching slots available (more likely decrease it), and it won&#x27;t decrease the number of Phd grads looking to teach (it would absolutely increase it).  Academia is already a lottery where the many chase the tiny number of tenure slots; does making the competition even fiercer and more Darwinian help improve the fairness?",1423708858

There are people in west Texas and North Dakota working on oil and gas drilling rigs. There are painters and carpenters, dentists and nurses and oncologists. There are Marines and Navy pilots and infantrymen and -women.  Many of these professions are largely the same as they were prior to the advent of the 1970s microcomputer revolution.<p>Of course, there are plenty of professions that are in trouble if not ceased to exist.  Shoe stores, book stores, and clothing stores are all in big trouble these days, as are small hardware stores and small grocery stores and non-chain coffee shops.<p>Someone who&#x27;s feeling the level of angst and confusion and directionless of this author should probably consider changing fields, or maybe disconnect more often and wander barefoot in a garden (watch out for deer ticks and yellow jacket wasps, though; nature is not necessarily all fun and games).<p>The internet is a tool, a means to an end.  It&#x27;s been a way for many of us to reconnect with long lost classmates, stay in touch with distant loved ones like never before.  It&#x27;s enabled severely handicapped people to have jobs and lead more productive lives.  It&#x27;s a miracle, really.<p>When I was a college student spending a couple of years abroad in Asia in 1980, there was no email, no Skype, and no cell phones.  I&#x27;d write long letters to the family on international airmail paper, fold it and put an airmail stamp on it, and drop it in the mailbox.  A couple of weeks later, it would get to my family in the U.S.  If I wanted to make an international call, it was a big and expensive project.  I took hundreds of photographs and they had to be developed, and copies made, and physically mailed out to people.<p>Now, kids doing a junior year abroad are light seconds away from their loved ones.  They can text their significant other 50 times a day, send them selfies, post a running travelogue on Facebook or Pinterest, and virtually speaking they are right next door.  It&#x27;s an incredible shift.  Take a video of where they are and post it to Youtube the same day.  Unbelievable, to those of us who grew up before this was all taken for granted.<p>And, probably there will be equally vast technological shifts in the future that will have the current 20-something generation, who are so tech-savvy, saying in 25 years -- Wow, we used to have this thing called &quot;email&quot; and we had to use Google to discover interesting facts!  We had to carry around these devices called tablets in order to access the world&#x27;s knowledge -- and even then, we couldn&#x27;t access all of it all the time!  We needed these little devices called cell phones in order to communicate.  Etc.  Huge paradigm shifts await us.<p>Perhaps they will not be so benign, e.g. vast AI entities that wrest control of our world away from us.  Perhaps we&#x27;ll be slaves of a future superior race of cyborgs, or wiped out as an inferior competitor.<p>The future is exciting, and challenging, and even though one can point to the dark corners and seediness of things at any given point, in the long run it&#x27;s an amazing ride, an endless roller coaster.  We have amazing power today to shape our future, if only we can understand and direct this power without destroying ourselves.<p>Just my 2 cents&#x27; ;-)",1423707841

4366696,comment,4366125,4366465,6,0,rayiner,,,"> This isn't an argument. It's rhetoric. If it were an argument, it would attempt to establish the criteria for deciding whether a particular set of government programs and the means for paying for them was ideal.<p>That doesn't logically follow. You can make an argument that a particular set of conditions exists without making the argument the particular set of conditions is the ideal balance of conditions.<p>> Surely there must be some level of democratically ordained wealth redistribution that would qualify as ""mooching"", no?<p>Sure. But ""mooching"" is a value-judgment that only makes sense in the context of some moral framework. There exist more sensible instantiations of that moral framework than I think the popular discourse is willing to admit to.<p>For example, why should the rules of society not be structured so the wealth created by this joint work is distributed proportionally to the number of hours of our finite and more or less equal-length lives we dedicate to that work? Sure, some people are much smarter than others, and their contributions far more valuable per hour, but people are more or less born with the intelligence they have, so why should they get credit or be penalized for that?<p>I'm not endorsing that particular distribution, but rather pointing out that it's a logically-defensible one. The point is that because of the structure of our society, it is impossible to precisely determine the value of each person's contribution to the net production (taking into account the whole spectrum of variables such as social stability, etc, over the infinite time horizon). Many people act as if the market equilibrium gives us a precise definition of that value, from which we can derive a definition of ""mooching"" but it gives us no such thing.<p>And at the end of the day, once we have labored mightily to determine who is mooching and who is not, what does that buy us? How much more efficient would our society be if nobody was mooching? The conservative Heritage foundation estimates the value of federal welfare spending to be about $175 billion, or 1.3% of GDP. The net social value of that spending is almost certainly more than that (how much would you pay to not live in a society like my native Bangladesh where poor children beg for food in the streets?). ""Mooching"" is something that has far more value in justifying moral indignation amongst conservatives than it does in any quantifiable economic sense.",1344614087

4366661,comment,4365255,4365610,28,0,richhickey,,,"I think Christophe's is the talk, and Yegge seriously misunderstood it, if he even bothered to watch it. Christophe's point was that basing the underpinnings of a DSL on macros was frequently a mistake, vs a data + functions approach that ""leads to greater dynamicity"". It is inarguable that macros are less flexible than functions (e.g. they can't be applied) and less composable. Christophe's argument wasn't against macros, but that they should be the last layer of sugar, not the core mechanism of a DSL. This approach has been advocated and practiced by Lispers forever. Ditto the advice to not use a macro when a function will do.<p>And for Yegge to imply that more serious Clojure devs like Christophe are macro averse because they are afraid they might not understand someone else's macro code shows his complete lack of familiarity with Christophe's macro skills and other work of the community.<p>Taking potshots at things you don't understand and people you don't know (while leaving out the link so others could verify) smells like a FOX-news rhetorical approach to me. Ditto political labeling (though in the programming community the negative tag is ""conservative"", whilst in politics it is ""liberal""). Tag the thing you don't like with the negative label, then rationalize, and spew misinformation. ""Clojure's community came pre-populated with highly conservative programmers from the pure-functional world: basically Haskell/ML types"": surveys[0][1] say... nope.<p>He even ignores the bulk of his own criteria in his labeling exercise. Clojure has almost none of the things on his ""Conservative Stuff"" list except STM (huh, is GC conservative too?) and almost all of the things on his ""Liberal Stuff"" list. None of his 1-8 conservative points apply to Clojure (and I see nothing wrong with conservative about speed - Common Lisp has always pursued it, and its pursuit always involves risk), and all of his 9 liberal points apply to Clojure.<p>Clojure devs are liberals that want their programs to work.<p>If Yegge doesn't like Clojure, fine.

Sometimes I find this inconvenient as the integration on the iOS app is not great (unless I'm missing something), and will never improve unless Apple exposes APIs allowing deeper integration; but my current thinking is the extra security is worth it. Previously all my passwords were the same thing modulo a changing non-alphanumeric char, which I understand is dumb, but I was too lazy to change them. The aforementioned Apple incident provided the final impetus for change. Obviously, it later transpired that the breach was down to social engineering and weaknesses in human security rather than compromised passwords, so all this is moot as the best security precautions are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain.<p>Something else I found interesting is Apple allows a max of 32 chars in their passwords. I discovered this as the password I was trying to set was significantly longer than this. Does this not suggest that the passwords are not hashed? If they were the length of password would not matter as the hash outputs are identical lengths and Apple could set the db column size accordingly.",1344612887

I get that the weights aren't important, but the curve shape seems to invalidate the notion of a p-value, because each font had more ""strongly X""s than ""weakly X""s. When your sample results are clustered at the extremes, what do you do to apply these statistical techniques?<p>Here is something I tried: arbitrarily choose a font as the ""control,"" in my case Georgia. Then to measure each other font, say Baskerville, randomly pair a Georgia data point with a Baskerville data point, and measure how much Baskerville improved agreement. (Comparing different shuffles, each font's mean improvement is pretty stable.) That gives what looks like a normal curve, at or least it is big in the middle and small on the edges. So now I can find a p-value, and my null hypothesis is that changing the font has no effect. I ran a t-test with R, and I got a p-value of 0.2069. So much less impressive than the article claims.

People who don't like it usually point to the unfamiliar and non-standard syntax (conservative), but the thing that I like about it is that it is more structured, and less error-prone than string splicing (also conservative).<p>In general, when I fall on the liberal side of an argument, I think it is for the reasons he gives (no fear, resist ossification). But when I fall on the conservative side (which happens just as often) it is not because of fear, but because I think that mathematically rigorous abstractions (pure functions, persistent data structures, etc) offer a more powerful way to approach the problem.<p>I think my attitude toward bugs (which he suggests is the defining issue) is more nuanced than this spectrum allows. Bugs are inevitable, and it's not the end of the world when you have a bug. We need debuggers. But I think that over time, if we are doing anything right, we should be growing a stable core of our codebase that is increasingly flexible and bug-free. I guess maybe this could be considered a centrist view. It is certainly neither liberal nor conservative.<p>Someone in the thread mentioned pragmatism vs. idealism.

I mean were Amazon and Qualcomm and eBay responsible for the ""suffering"" of the dot com crash and the subsequent global recession?<p>A speculative bubble burst and the result was a serious, systemic credit crunch and a deep recession. That's not a crime.",1344610837

Rand used this killer as an early model for the type of ""ideal man"" she promoted in her more famous books.""<p>""What did Rand admire so much about Hickman? His sociopathic qualities: ""Other people do not exist for him, and he does not see why they should,"" she wrote, gushing that Hickman had ""no regard whatsoever for all that society holds sacred, and with a consciousness all his own. He has the true, innate psychology of a Superman. He can never realize and feel 'other people.'"" """,1344610806

So, for example, you have three stage processing: 1)capture phase, 2)target phase, and 3)bubble phase. YUI 3 has its own API, but they still follow that model. This is a bit stronger contract than just your generic EventEmitter, which only implies a simple observer model.",1344610803

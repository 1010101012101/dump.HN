9409738,comment,9408942,9408942,0,0,kyledrake,,,"I&#x27;ve received a subpoena from Cook County before regarding a site on Neocities. Related to Tor, actually. Easily the stupidest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life.<p>The person that signed the subpoena was in the news for allegations of corruption, and so was her husband (it&#x27;s called Crook County for a reason). They spelled the name of my company wrong (noahcities.com or something like that), and when I sent a letter to the designated agents requesting they fix it (I control neocities.org, not noahcities, how can I respond to legal requests addressed to a different web site?), they never responded, and the subpoena basically just died.<p>If they had followed up, they would have gotten a tor exit IP address somewhere outside of their jurisdiction (read: another country). I told them this before they filed it, and they told me &quot;That decision is for someone above my pay grade, man&quot;. You can&#x27;t spend 5 minutes to google for Tor because of your &quot;pay grade&quot;?<p>Oh, and they also love to put unlawful (but unfortunately, not illegal) gag orders in their subpoenas. I chose not to waste our lawyer&#x27;s time (and our money) on this piece of trash, so we didn&#x27;t make too big of a deal about it.<p>The take home lesson for me was that crooked regional governments abusing the subpoena system are just as big of a problem as the NSA, if not worse.<p>So, now you know the story behind this commit <a href=""http://github.com/neocities/neocities/commit/4983a9b24eac00b8d8bfd300a18cdcee0152a271"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/neocities/neocities/commit/4983a9b24eac00b...</a><p>It&#x27;s not good enough for the NSA, but it will prevent these idiots from ever figuring it out. And there&#x27;s no US data retention laws for web sites, so it&#x27;s completely legal.<p>This is textbook Neocities business philosophy. Instead of raising money to hire more lawyers and take the legal risk individually fighting bad John Doe subpoenas, we changed our code to make the data they can actually get worthless to them, so we can just serve them (if they&#x27;re valid) while still protecting our users&#x27; privacy. If we get dragged into court over it, our liability insurance kicks in, we pay a (relatively) small deductible, and then we can use the precedent we set there to throw out any new cases for everybody with this problem, not just us. Way more sustainable.<p>Phase 2 is that I delete the hashes after a few months. I haven&#x27;t gotten to it yet, but it&#x27;s in the ticket tracker.",1429552794

Right now many technologies like video cards are wandering in the desert, adding on more and more opaque layers rather than providing general purpose computing.  So that&#x27;s set simulation back at least a decade or two and hindered progress in fields like AI.<p>I just want to address one of the main complaints about FPGAs - that they require more chip area to route logic.  This is not as big of a deal as it sounds because today 3/4 of a chip&#x27;s area or more is often dedicated to mundane things like cache.<p>Also since there has been little progress in breaking the 3 GHz barrier since the early 2000s, everything is moving towards higher transistor counts.  So the added cost of layout goes down over time and after about 3 years is on par with the previous generation.  So we have a chicken and egg problem where true general purpose parallel computing can&#x27;t get off the ground because it&#x27;s perceived as too expensive, but it&#x27;s too expensive because it hasn&#x27;t gotten off the ground yet.<p>Breaking that chicken and egg cycle by opening FPGAs could trigger an overnight adoption of them, even greater than when Bitcoin triggered renewed interest in ASICs.",1429552497

9409697,comment,9408551,9409259,0,0,yellowapple,,,"> Are all the new languages such huge advances over older ones that they do that?<p>I don&#x27;t know about other languages, but having personally migrated from Perl and Ruby to Erlang/Elixir, I at least believe that to be the case in that particular circumstance.<p>A big part of it is that parallel programming is starting to catch on as mainstream rather than something to be shunned or avoided; whereas in the past folks were conditioned to avoid having to deal with threading or forking because of having to think about thread safety, there are now languages like Erlang (and its kids Elixir and LFE), Rust, Go, Scala, Julia, etc. that are meant to make parallel computing easier to reason about or less dangerous (or sometimes even both).<p>On top of this, though, Erlang-and-kids&#x27; reliability features allow them to achieve the legendary &quot;nine-nines&quot; of uptime (99.9999999%) relatively easily (I say &quot;relatively&quot; because - while you certainly still have to think about it (particularly if you&#x27;re trying to push a change to, say, how data is represented on the (D)ETS or Mnesia or CouchDB or SQL or whatever side of things) - it&#x27;s much easier than with a lot of other languages).  That level of availability has <i>huge</i> implications for a company&#x27;s bottom line, particularly those companies that measure downtime in &quot;thousands of dollars per second&quot; instead of just seconds.  A well-written Erlang/OTP (or Elixir/OTP or LFE/OTP or anything/OTP) application can do this on the software side rather effectively (on the hardware side, you&#x27;d still want redundancy wherever possible/feasible, including on the network side of things; most well-run hospitals, for example, will have connections with at least two different ISPs so that if one goes out, they still have the other, and will only lose connectivity in very extreme circumstances).<p>In the case of Elixir, it makes for a very solid migration target from, say, a Rails codebase; the syntax is a bit more modern (I personally prefer Erlang&#x27;s in many cases, but Elixir&#x27;s pipe operator is a godsend) and familiar to Rubyists (&quot;do&quot; blocks, more flexible pipelining with the |> operator, etc.), while being fully compatible with the existing Erlang and growing Elixir ecosystems.",1429552359

9409670,comment,9408551,9408992,0,0,lectrick,,,"> but unfortunately because it uses a functional language, it drastically cuts down the mindshare of developers. I don&#x27;t even know any developers in real life that use functional languages.<p>1) Once upon a time, almost no one used object oriented languages except for Smalltalk weirdos.<p>2) Ruby, javascript and a host of other languages have &quot;functional&quot; features. Does your language have a &quot;lambda&quot; feature, where you can define nameless functions and pass them around as arguments to other functions? Then you are <i>already working with functional language paradigms.</i> There&#x27;s nothing really &quot;magically hard&quot; about it, you&#x27;re overselling how hard it is. This is not rocket science. Most existing programmers can handle it.<p>The hardest thing I had to wrap my mind around when switching my work to Elixir was <i>letting go of mutable state.</i> And attributes and methods on objects. And guess what... It seems that it&#x27;s a good idea, generally!<p>If you see enough bugs that are only there because something modified an attribute in some unpredictable way which impacted upstream code... You will realize mutable state is bad.<p>If you still aren&#x27;t convinced that mutable state is evil, watch this Rich Hickey presentation <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hic...</a> which basically proves that mutable state actually makes state a function of a hidden/conflated &quot;time&quot; variable, proving it&#x27;s not just wrong from a practical standpoint (in the form of extra bugs that are hard to reason about, and all this brittle mutex code) but from a theoretical one, too. Mutable state comes from a time when memory was expensive, and it&#x27;s time to ditch the training wheels so we can get the real work done.<p>Both Javascript and Ruby use mutable state extensively, and it&#x27;s unfortunately not something you can just slap onto the language after the fact (although ClojureScript must make a valiant effort!) And if the high-level language wasn&#x27;t built with it from the get-go, then you&#x27;re stuck dealing with legacy libraries using the poorer-written code (see: Ruby gems).",1429552066

I think I can see what you&#x27;re trying to say, but for example owning a car has both an opportunity cost, and a high depreciation cost.<p>It&#x27;s entirely plausible to end up financially far ahead by not owning a car (The same can be true for housing in some markets).  Of course this depends on your usage, but it is plausible.  So if you want to argue about the (very real for some people) less tangible benefits, you can&#x27;t ignore the fact that these may come at a very real financial (i.e. opportunity) cost.",1429550916

Why it was made so, will be kept under the covers of the NDA agreement.<p>Standard case of a large company doing it wrong and blaming somebody else when it comes back to bite them rather than fixing it. And hiding behind an NDA. Seriously what was the expectation? That JDBC never changes? Because at that time JDBC was already at version 3.0 which is obviously the final version after which no features would ever be added again.<p>> Another use case, many developers mock JDBC by creating their own dummy drivers, specially in large companies where mocking libraries are frown upon.<p>If you&#x27;re doing it wrong then you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Nobody to blame but yourself. Just because you&#x27;re a large company doesn&#x27;t make it right. Part of why it&#x27;s wrong is that it will come back and bite you later on. And that&#x27;s the problem in this case? The compiler tells you where you need to implement which methods.<p>Two give you two other examples. Interfaces for HTTP likely need to be updated when something in HTTP changes (WebSockets, HTTP/2). Servers implementing this will need to be updated to implement this. You don&#x27;t accuse the language of the web server to make a breaking change. That&#x27;s just how these things work. Same for SSL/TLS features like SNI. Sure it could be that you absolutely have to run your own web server or SSL/TLS implementations for reasons that you can&#x27;t disclose because you&#x27;re under an NDA.

User-facing car software has been uniformly awful. Google&#x27;s self-driving car prototypes, while cute (in the so-ugly-its-cute way), aren&#x27;t particularly inspiring as automobiles. This separation of concerns lets both companies focus on their strengths (which can be combined down the road, as long as the self-driving technology becomes licensable).

It&#x27;s no fluke that the demographics for scene members often favors younger people, I know that for the internet in general, when I was younger, it was a magic place where age didn&#x27;t matter, only merits. I would assume the scene is no different. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much you make, and your race, religion, age are not important. You are judged by what you can DO not who you ARE. That alone is a VERY powerful motivator.<p>Secondly I think the scene is very appealing to people who have a tech inclination plus a love/hobby for something else (Software, movies. music, etc). The scene allows them to interact with people who share the same interests and gives them access (through top sites or similar) to more content that they love.<p>Lastly sharing. When I like/love something there is a part of me that wants to share it with everyone else. When that something is funny story then all is well and good but when it&#x27;s a TV show/movie/album/etc it&#x27;s a little harder to share. Sure you can share a link to Amazon/Netflix/etc but unless your friend already pays for access then you share isn&#x27;t &quot;free&quot;. It&#x27;s free to you but not to the person you are sharing. Piracy makes it easier to share because you don&#x27;t let those pesky laws get in the way. Even so sharing is not 100% free, you can tell someone about a piece of content but they still have to go find it, download it, and then they can watch it. Topsites are like your friends opening up all of their content so that you can sample it on your own or go grab something on their recommendation. There is still a little friction to the sharing (a direct link to watch would be ideal) but it&#x27;s about as close as you can get.<p>That&#x27;s just my 2 cents.<p>To answer directly to: What motivates someone to risk so much and invest so much time and money into participating in the scene today?<p>I, for example, love messing around with web dev. Because of this I have tried out (and continue to pay for) a number of online hosting platforms (both dedicated, shared, and your AWS/DO/RS/Google clouds) either to try them out or because I am long-term hosting things on them. This ends up being a fair amount of money when all is said and done but it&#x27;s my hobby, it&#x27;s what I love and it benefits me at work. Now other than the &quot;benefits me at work&quot; bit I don&#x27;t see how my hobby is any different from file sharers (legality aside).

A much better way forward would be to implement a truly transactional and functional packaging system (a la nix/guix), where updates could be rolled back seamlessly.<p>Exactly, and this is what CoreOS does.<p>I see this as the role that containers fill. Systemd already supports what you describe, via systemd-nspawn, which allows native containerization, and with btrfs, which allows either persistent or ephemeral containers to be built off of a &quot;template&quot;[0].<p>Systemd is already able to run Docker images and even pull them directly from the Docker registry, so I&#x27;d rather see containers adopted as the new model of vendoring[1] rather than PPAs.<p>And since Debian already uses systemd now, this should be very easy to integrate.<p>[0] I put &quot;template&quot; in quotation marks because I&#x27;m using the term loosely here; nspawn uses the word template to refer to something different.<p>[1] Let&#x27;s be frank: while PPAs can do more, 90% of the PPAs I was asked to add when I used Ubuntu were basically aimed at solving vendoring and/or versioning issues.",1429549571

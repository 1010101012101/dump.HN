Based on my limited knowledge of the project, the only way they could have consistent coverage would be to have evenly spaced balloons around the Earth. That assumes that wind currents would cause the balloons to travel around the Earth in a dependable pattern. Considering the circumference of the Earth 40,008km and 80km coverage diameter, 40008 / 80 = 500 balloons would be required at minimum if all the balloons traveled at the same speed and in a dependable pattern. I would imagine the wind currents the balloons would travel on would be greater than the Earth&#x27;s circumference, so more than 500 balloons would be required. Also, I doubt the balloons could maintain a perfect 80km spacing. I can think of other factors that would make dependable coverage difficult.",1426103538

He&#x27;s often said he wants to breed albino elk because hunters will pay a fortune to bag one, but he has yet to get even one. Fortunately, regular elk will do for most.  Hunters pay to come onto his land and shoot elk. He leads them out in a pickup and, depending on how trustworthy the hunter is, has his sons split off the animal he wants shot (a hunter with poor aim might unwittingly take out a mating bull or pregnant cow, thereby multiplying the cost by a factor of two or <i>much</i> more).  &quot;Hunters&quot; tend to get upset if they&#x27;re suddenly on the hook for a much larger bill than initially agreed upon.<p>Some of the customers paying to shoot elk are just frustrated hunters.  They&#x27;ve been out hunting and simply had no luck, but didn&#x27;t want to go home empty handed. For them, my uncle&#x27;s farm is the backup plan.  Some customers like the taste of elk and want it out of season (wild elk can be legally hunted for only a few months per year).  However, there are also those who just want to shoot a big game animal but entirely lack the expertise to hunt.<p>Meat and velvet (antlers) are still bigger sources of income, but hunters make an impressive contribution to my uncle&#x27;s revenues. My uncle started his farm in the eighties when farming elk was virtually unheard of but, even today, when Elk farms are much more common and Elk meat is on a lot of restaurant menus, Elk are still viewed as wild animals.  This is not entirely inaccurate.  Even the &quot;tame&quot; elk on my uncle&#x27;s farm are quite vicious to anything shorter than them.  Short hunters are advised to stay in the truck at all times!<p>If you want to spot an elk farm, the give-away is the 8-foot (minimum) and sturdily built fence that surrounds them.  Elk are excellent jumpers and bulls have the mass of a bovine cow.  Imagine a cow that can clear a six foot fence, and you have an idea of what elk are like.",1426103188

9186494,comment,9184779,9184779,0,0,keppy,,,"> Another such area of work is logical time, manifest as vector clocks, version vectors, and other ways of abstracting over the ordering of events. This idea generally acknowledges the inability to assume synchronized clocks and builds notions of ordering for a world in which clocks are entirely unreliable.<p>Hardware is unreliable. Software is possibly less reliable. We have known that for a long time. The author talks on a conceptual level about logical time, but this concept isn&#x27;t enough to understand the real challenges & possible solutions of keeping interactions in your system logically ordered in the dimension of time[0].<p>> You can think of coordination as providing a logical surrogate for &quot;now.&quot; When used in that way, however, these protocols have a cost, resulting from something they all fundamentally have in common: constant communication. For example, if you coordinate an ordering for all of the things that happen in your distributed system, then at best you are able to provide a response latency no less than the round-trip time (two sequential message deliveries) inside that system.<p>Consensus protocols don&#x27;t provide a logical surrogate for &#x27;now&#x27;, a log does that. The silver bullet for assuring that your transactions are ordered correctly is immutability[1]--&quot;If two identical, deterministic processes begin in the same state and get the same inputs in the same order, they will produce the same output and end in the same state.[0]&quot;
It&#x27;s important, from the perspective of the implementor, to understand that there are multiple pieces to this puzzle, and that each protocol has very specific details that can make or break the reliability and performance of a distributed system. This is similar to how a small bug in your cryptography code can expose the entire system to threat. Paxos itself can be implemented in a myriad of ways, and each decision the implementor makes must be well researched.<p>[0]<a href=""http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying"" rel=""nofollow"">http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what...</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://basho.com/clocks-are-bad-or-welcome-to-distributed-systems/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://basho.com/clocks-are-bad-or-welcome-to-distributed-sy...</a>",1426102824

The point that’s always made is that something already is this magical and perfect meritocracy with the selection process already working perfectly. The term meritocracy is thrown into the faces of those that question the selection process as a defense of the selection process. Perfectness is just assumed, not something to be strived for. Your statement makes just no sense at all when considering the context in which meritocracy is typically used when defending exclusionary selection processes. It’s downright absurd.<p>And that’s even ignoring all the grave moral quandaries you get into when you base who can participate on merit – if that is even possible and if you can even coherently define what the hell merit means. Merit is hard to nail down and as such can be easily used as a convenient tool for exclusion.<p>In light of the long and heated debates about how to best conduct job interviews (nobody knows, really!), often seen right here on HN, this all is especially absurd. It seems that put into a slightly different context (of a job interview) everyone knows that selection processes are frail, complex, complicated things, hard to get right – and even at its best you will make mistakes. Selection processes are fucking hard to get right. Doesn’t everyone know that? How, in that context, can you then turn around and claim that there is no issue because meritocracy. It sounds like a bad joke. A horrible joke, one that kills all debate about selection processes and how we can improve them (or even where selection is necessary and where not and based on what and how and how we should deal with the frailty and difficulty of evaluating human fucking beings.)",1426102441

The &quot;logic&quot; section of the LSAT (traditionally said to be the hardest part of the test) is much easier if you know some computer science/discrete math. A lot of questions can be quickly parsed into some sort of constraint satisfaction problem, and using the right tool (drawing truth tables/constructing a directed acyclic graph) means you can get to the answer much faster.[1] Since the LSAT is a time-pressure based test, this gives you a big advantage. Of course, the reading comprehension parts are still hard, and engineering gives you no advantage there. There&#x27;s also lots of selection bias potentially going on - engineers who go on to take the LSAT are <i>rare</i>. Who knows how that prior correlates with ability.<p>Somewhat relatedly, it&#x27;s been well known that for CS PhD admissions, at least with native English speakers, the GRE Verbal is a better predictor of PhD performance than the GRE Math. It&#x27;s unclear how much of this is top-end compression in math though (almost everyone going to a top CS PhD school gets a 790 or 800 on the GRE Math, so there&#x27;s no signal left there, whereas verbal has a higher spread. A 720 on the verbal is 98th percentile).[2]<p>[1] I know this because in 2009 as a college senior, I took some practice LSAT tests, and found the logic section endlessly delightful and challenging in a timed setting - I was <i>this</i> close to applying to law schools before I changed my mind and did a CS PhD instead. I know it sounds like a weird choice, but 2009 was a weird soul-searching year for me for various personal reasons.<p>[2] All of this has changed since 2011 when the GRE scoring system changed to a 130-170 scale from the old 200-800 scale, along with changes to the test itself.

Driving yourself batty waiting on everyone else is a fool&#x27;s errand.<p>2) If nothing is going to be done &quot;today&quot;, call it a day and go home. Seriously. Use the time to run personal errands, think, and do things that will take your mind off of the things holding you up.<p>A former CEO would get real fidgety when things weren&#x27;t done exactly when he envisioned them and would then spend the next several hours frequently checking in with us and just slow things down. If you&#x27;re getting antsy about things, the best thing you can do is take yourself out of the environment until you calm down and not infect the rest of your team. People feed off their leader&#x27;s emotions and if you&#x27;re getting fidgety they&#x27;ll start getting nervous and frustrated.<p>Long Term:<p>1) Budget in time for self-improvement. Be reading as much as you can, take up a physically active hobby that gets you moving, and try to improve in areas of weakness.<p>2) Budget work time to think and plan out the business. Bill Gates was famous for taking thinking trips where he&#x27;d duck out for a week with a stack of research papers and other materials to see where the industry was headed and figure out how to get in front of it. You might have not the time to take a week, but take a day here and there to pay attention to the trends going on around you.<p>3) Know when to hold &#x27;em and know when to fold &#x27;em. Sometimes you gotta ride herd when things aren&#x27;t getting done for legitimate reasons (i.e. everyone&#x27;s clowning around). Other times, you gotta let things ride and accept that it&#x27;s not all under your control -- you can&#x27;t control the server crashing, unforeseen technical bugs, delayed client responses etc. Learn to be comfortable with things not being under your control and not letting it frustrate you to no end.<p>4) Enjoy the down time! Really. We all think we have to be hyper productive all the time and any down time is simply a waste of our time because we could be doing <i>something</i>. I struggle with this a lot and it makes it hard to be. Consider having an unplanned hole in the schedule as an opportunity to take 15 minutes to clear your head--writing helps me a lot--refocus and prepare for the next challenge.

You might not feel the same way  about places you live in, but some people feel VERY STRONGLY emotionally about where they live. Consider the fact that when there&#x27;s natural disasters/flood/earthquake/radiation leaks, there&#x27;s not insignificant percentage of people who would rather stay where they are and suffer the consequences rather than move away.

9186210,comment,9185242,9185761,0,0,theVirginian,,,"I interned in a law firm my entire senior year and now hold a BA with majors in Government and Philosophy. These experiences would leave me well primed to go to law school which was my original intention after graduation. After spending time in the firm however it is really eye opening to see how the business is rapidly changing. There is an over supply of young lawyers these days for a number of reason.<p>First, there are too many low quality law schools churning out people who can barely pass the bar. Those schools take home the tuition money and the young graduates have a mountain of non-dischargable debt with nowhere to turn. The rate of unemployed young graduates is actually probably even higher than figures show because schools will pay a small stipend to recent graduates so that they can say they are &quot;employed&quot; when the yearly figures for former students employed 6mo out are released. It&#x27;s all about taking home the tuition for these schools and they shamefully advertise how demand for lawyers will increase and job prospects will remain high.<p>Second, the business has become vastly more efficient as firms begin to adopt digital case management systems and can now conduct research online instead of having to sort through volumes of old books. You know when you see the generic shelves of law books in offices? Yeah those just sit there collecting dust now. They are for show because all of that information has now moved onto the computer. The legal industry has been slow and late to adopt technology but it has made lawyers vastly more efficient than they could have been before. Even things like being able to email scans of documents can speed up the process astronomically. As older lawyers who cannot use computers begin to exit the workforce and younger ones who can move up in the ranks, firms just do not need as many people working as they did before. The vast majority of legal work is not what you see on TV or in the Ellen Pao case where it is a battle of the brains in real time for a court room. It is mundane routine paperwork that can be automated or done by assistants.<p>A lot of this stuff can even be done at home by your average person with products like turbo tax that enable the average person to not need representation for basic needs legal needs anymore.<p>I no longer plan on going to law school and have been taking online courses in programming/reading a ton of programming books since I graduated in hopes of turning what has been a long term hobby of mine into a career, hopefully combined with politics or law. (I am thinking campaign research/advertising online or legal software on the law side.)",1426101155

At the very least it would be wise to relocate across the Bay.<p>I realize that people have families, social networks, and small-scale culture that they don&#x27;t want to separate from.  It&#x27;s a sad reality, but sometimes the economic forces that re-balance labor markets require people to physically relocate.  If your labor is not as valuable in a particular geographic region, it&#x27;s time to retrain or move. For most people retraining is not an option...<p>My sentiment is not classist or elitist.  The same argument applies to people of all socioeconomic backgrounds.  I have personally relocated for financial reasons three times in my life.  I moved away from home for college, I moved to a new location for my first job, then I recently relocated to the Bay Area because this was the optimal place for me to be economically.  I did all this with very little money saved up and with no financial support outside my paycheck.  It has been easier for me to keep in touch with my family than it would be for these people (I make enough to travel to visit family several times a year).  However, I have made sacrifices and relocated for my personal financial well-being.  If I had a family to look after, I would have (and arguably ought to have) sacrificed even more.<p>EDIT: That being said, I fully support relaxing regulation on the construction of new housing.

If you have to leave before the buchou, you apologize, e.g. &quot;O saki ni, shitsurei shimasu&quot;.<p>If the boss is not there, then it&#x27;s not quite the open office; it&#x27;s a slightly strawman version of the open office which doesn&#x27;t quite include everyone. Even so, the boss can come out peek at the workspace at any time and tell at a glance who is there and who isn&#x27;t, and who is doing what.",1426100600

Existence of them became possible due to programming becoming lucrative, with plenty of easy learning material, and therefore, beneficial for people you wouldn&#x27;t at all consider a nerd to learn. It&#x27;s a programmer who comes from outside of nerd culture, who looks at it like a cool kid from high school looks at school nerds.<p>It has also a bit &quot;hipsterish&quot; connotation - brogrammer is someone who&#x27;s &quot;not really into it&quot;. &quot;The true nerds&quot; were programmers before it was cool.<p>At least that&#x27;s how I understand this term. &quot;disliked man in the tech world&quot; is much too broad, as so called &quot;brogrammers&quot; are supposed to dislike &quot;true nerds&quot;.",1426100494

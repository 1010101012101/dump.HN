4309338,comment,4308190,4308190,3,0,javajosh,,,"Ben, I like where you're going but I think we need to go just a little bit further to make it viable. In particular, it's email that's the weak link (so to speak). But it's entirely possible and desirable to replace email with something that has emails positive qualities without it's drawbacks. I'm thinking a secure, realtime channel to which only you have access, and a notification system that let's you see (on all your devices) what got posted there. Anyone (or anything) in the world can post to it, and they are guaranteed that you'll get first crack at the data. (In this case the data is a one time URL).<p>What sort of thing represents a secure, real-time channel to which only you have access? Note that, unlike email, we are not interested in queueing messages in this channel. My first thought runs to a public URL, a place where anyone can post anything, and it will appear on all your devices (possibly within the browser).<p>So basically as long as you maintain credentials to access that channel, sites have a good way to give you a one-use login URL.<p>In an ideal world, you're browser would have a password protected private key and knowledge of what your personal URL is. All sites requiring login would ask the browser for that URL, and the site would send a one-time login URL to the channel URL, and the browser would be smart enough to just follow the link.<p>Bam, login nirvana.",1343588235

That's certainly a good way to teach for many but for some it doesn't work.<p>A similar case was physics for me (classical mechanics in particular). From grade 5 to 10 (after which I avoided the subject) there was little insight gained (e.g. heavy things fall down, there may be some friction, memorize all those seemingly random formulas and if you use a long lever, make sure you pick a strong material). Then I was exposed to an introduction to physics course at university (for non-majors) and the revelation that all those random formulas have a strong grounding in just 3 general principles and can then be developed with some help from calculus was liberating. Just too late in my case. Maybe I would have loved physics and actually study it, had they told me in 7th grade that there is something tying all of it together, and the ultimate goal of the class was to reach that summit. Just trying to show the other side of the coin which should be integrated into the way math and science is taught in schools in my opinion :-)<p>[1] Say, the top 5-10% of middle school students.",1343587648

Essentially, through the use of hash tags, Twitter has created a new conversation/comment stream that any one in the world can be a part of. For example, while watching the Olympics, there are several hash tags that show up on screen and allow everyone from celebrities to random people talk about it. It creates a conversation that is not even possible using other mediums. They're not doing social networking better, they've created a new way to communicate. This changes mass media from being a one-way conversation to a place where anyone can participate in the conversation.<p>App.net simply can never do this as a result of it costing money. Since it can't build a large user base of ""regular"" people, the data on App.net simply won't be that interesting or very open. Sure it would be a cool service, and for many people, particularly geeks, it might be nice. It could even be a great medium to communicate with specific people, but it will never be as useful as Twitter in the sense that it will never be able to fill the same space as Twitter.<p>If there really is a problem with Twitter's business model that's causing cash problems all they need to do is charge for API access.

While a name-based virtual host is usually specified as a domain name, it doesn't need to be. Many web sites share a single IP, so it should be possible to access them without requiring DNS resolution (examples showing name-based virtual host in brackets as one possible approach):<p><pre><code>    http://[www.example.com]192.0.2.1/\n    http://[www.example.org]192.0.2.1/\n    http://[www.example.net]192.0.2.1/\n    http://[foo]192.0.2.1/\n</code></pre>\nOr requiring DNS resolution:<p><pre><code>    http://[www.example.org]www.example.com/\n    http://[foo]www.example.com/\n</code></pre>\nNote that this doesn't serve the same purpose as a subdomain, because it allows one to explicitly specify the name-based virtual host to serve from a domain or IP address, instead of having a single part serve two very different purposes.<p>Of course there are issues. For example, you could create URIs like:<p><pre><code>    http://[www.google.com]192.0.2.1/\n</code></pre>\nAnd SSL poses a challenge:<p><pre><code>    https://[www.example.org]www.example.com/\n    https://[foo]www.example.com/\n    https://[www.example.com]192.0.2.1/\n</code></pre>\nBut from a technical perspective, this opens up a lot of possibilities.

For example, the recently HN-featured profile of Jack Dorsey by Wired's Steven Levy[1]:<p><i>But our discussion is sidetracked when the proprietor, Vincent Fung, starts a long and complicated explanation of the various tea options. Dorseylike Jobsis interested in Eastern thought, and after listening to a detailed rundown of the exotic choices, he approves Fungs suggestion to try a dark and musty chunk of Pu-erh tea from Chinas Yunnan Province. A few minutes later, Fung appears at the booth with a deep wooden tray and begins a carefully choreographed ceremony, pouring a continuous stream of hot water over tiny cups. Then he pours water on top of a lid that partially covers the bowl containing densely packed cakes of tea. Dorsey watches the ritual and appreciatively touches his finger to a worn corner of the tray.</i><p>This is how an in-person interview is meant to be conveyed to the reader not as a transcript.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/business/2012/06/ff_dorsey/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/business/2012/06/ff_dorsey/</a>",1343584887

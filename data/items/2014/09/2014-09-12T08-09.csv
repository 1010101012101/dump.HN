It knows how to pair with my phone via bluetooth for calls, but it does not work the other way around - my phone can&#x27;t send audio to the car. The audio head unit is a bit thick (it will resume in the wrong place for MP3 CDs, and the optional iPod interface is really dumb and requires creation of playlists, which is not very helpful for a 160GB iPod; that&#x27;s a lot of playlists).<p>Admittedly perhaps my car is considered old (6 years, 86k miles in a diesel) but I am certain that there are many more cars that don&#x27;t have bluetooth duplex audio. It would be wrong to assume that all cars have it.<p>Come to think of it, my wife&#x27;s car (2010 Mini Cooper) doesn&#x27;t have two-way audio either! It&#x27;s got a USB interface so the iPod works properly, and you can pair to make and receive calls via bluetooth but I don&#x27;t think it can pipe audio to the car.<p>Unless I am mistaken?",1410512305

Go is billed as a &quot;systems language&quot;, for whatever that means, but in practice occupies a space similar to Java. It&#x27;s quite well-suited for server and applications programming, but various design choices mean that it&#x27;s less well-suited for lower-level programming domains like operating system components or device drivers, performance-intensive video games, or hard-real-time embedded systems.<p>On the other hand, Rust is aimed at being a replacement for C++ or even C: it allows for precise control over lower-level aspects of the machine while providing more static guarantees of correctness by means of a powerful type system. For example, Rust prevents dangling and null pointers and disallows access to uninitialized memory while retaining manual memory management, as well as allowing garbage collection as a library-provided feature and not a core language feature. In that sense, Rust is suitable for problem domains that Go is not.",1410512080

8307137,comment,8306667,8307067,3,0,Patient0,,,"One thing that this article and lot of other Monad articles gloss over is the scoping in &quot;do&quot; notation and when using the >>= operator.<p>The example:<p><pre><code>    return 7 >>= (\\x -> Writer (x+1,&quot;inc.&quot;))\n             >>= (\\x -> Writer (2*x,&quot;double.&quot;))\n             >>= (\\x -> Writer (x-1,&quot;dec.&quot;))\n</code></pre>\nworks for this example, but a more accurate representation of how &quot;do&quot; notation is expanded is:<p><pre><code>    return 7 >>= (\\x -> Writer (x+1,&quot;inc.&quot;)\n             >>= (\\x -> Writer (2*x,&quot;double.&quot;)\n             >>= (\\x -> Writer (x-1,&quot;dec.&quot;))))\n</code></pre>\nNote that I&#x27;ve moved the parentheses.<p>Actually, you can, equivalently, omit the parentheses for the same meaning, because the &#x27;->&#x27; has very low precedence:<p><pre><code>    return 7 >>= \\x -> Writer (x+1,&quot;inc.&quot;)\n             >>= \\x -> Writer (2*x,&quot;double.&quot;)\n             >>= \\x -> Writer (x-1,&quot;dec.&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nThe point is, most times each of subsequent functions need to &quot;see&quot; what was in scope in the earlier functions. Most times, the later monadic actions need information that is pulled out of the monad in previous actions.<p>For example, consider the following:<p><pre><code>    main = putStrLn &quot;Enter your first name&quot; >>=\n       \\_ -> getLine >>=\n       \\first -> putStrLn &quot;Enter your last name&quot; >>=\n       \\_ -> getLine >>=\n       \\last -> putStrLn (&quot;Hello &quot; ++ first ++ &quot; &quot; ++ last ++ &quot;.&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nThe last monadic action needs both &quot;first&quot; and &quot;last&quot; to both be in scope. This only works because of the way that it is implicitly parenthesized.<p>Until I &quot;got&quot; this, I was very confused by most of the Monad examples I found.<p>Here&#x27;s an article I wrote about the IO monad which also makes this point: <a href=""https://github.com/Patient0/IOMonad"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Patient0/IOMonad</a>",1410511682

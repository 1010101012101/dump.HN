It can do all sorts of calculations automatically, but you can also easily program it to do them manually; it shows you a step-by-step derivation of pretty much anything it can compute.<p>Many mathematicians use it for their day-to-day research, and for learning something like calculus it can be enlightening to have millions of examples of anything you can think of at the tip of a finger.",1289908786

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QrnwoO1-8A<p>Why Kinetic matters:
http://www.memo.tv/kinect_why_it_matters<p>Small part of the article:<p>What the kinect does, is nothing new. There have been depth sensing cameras on the market for quite a while, and some probably with better quality and build. What sets the kinect apart? Its price. At £130 it isn't something everyone can go out and buy a handful of, but it is a consumer device. It is a device that most people who want it can either buy it, or will know someone who can get hold of one or they can borrow. It is a potential common household item. Whereas anything else on the market that comes close to its capabilities costs significantly more (starting at £2000, jumping up to £4000-£5000+), and not to mention being aimed at industrial businesses, robotics, military etc. they are considerably more complicated to acquire and use.
But why does this matter?

Teacher entrance exams and reshuffling money. Reshuffling money where exactly? What else did they do to improve scores?<p>I'd also like to point out that in many other countries the state is seen as the first employer of choice. Unlike the US where Apple, Oracle, Google, and Microsoft get the best picks first and the state can choose later many countries, if you do well in school you are slotted for a teaching or gov't job with great benefits, lifetime employment, guaranteed pension, housing, etc. This might not mean much to those in the US but in Europe and most of Asia a government job is a seriously good job.<p>This affects the US education because some of the best teachers aren't even considering teaching, not when they can pull Google money, Facebook money, or Intel money. So in that regard, the unions are right. Our free market works so well that teachers have to be paid more. Not all teachers, but certainly the best ones.<p>This is why it's important to factor in opportunity costs when doing these samples.

5613965,comment,5613007,5613734,1,0,fennecfoxen,,,"Theory. If you expect that the price of bitcoins is going to be somewhere in the next month, but it's wildly deviated from that on the spot market, there is a monetary incentive to buy/sell bitcoin until the prices are in line with long-term expectations -- discounted for risk, of course. Derivatives like futures options reduce that risk, because you can lock in that future price right now. If anyone's offering, that is.<p>Derivatives could also reduce risk for users. For instance: you're a business that accepts bitcoins for payment. But the price of bitcoins can fall by 50% in a day! So you'd better transfer those bitcoins to cash the moment you get them, or you're subject to losing half your cash any day. Something that's too hot to handle like that kind of damages the ability to use it as a medium of exchange, doesn't it? But you could alternatively buy bitcoin currency futures, essentially locking in your current price. So maybe you could hang onto those bitcoins a while and use them to pay people for your referral program or something. (Oh, sure, there's a cost associated with it, but there are costs associated with translating cash back and forth as well. Depending on the price of the derivatives, it might make sense.)",1366995526

As you pointed out, talented people flock to the city and are a key ingredient of the incredibly rich economic substrate - but there's also the cultural opportunities, schools, social scene, etc etc.  Of course, all of these things are interlinked and reinforce one another - but at the end of the day, the price of housing is dictated by supply and demand.<p>Thirdly, real estate developers are entrepreneurs, too - they typically take on huge risks over long periods of time to create actual products that are (hopefully) incredibly valuable for their customers.  I'd argue that housing is a lot more important to most folks than another social media app or whatever.<p>Finally, in the case of property owners (not developers), they're simply holding onto an asset and trying to optimize their returns.  I don't see how this is morally objectionable as long as they don't do anything underhanded (which certainly does happen).  But at the end of the day, they're simply trying to ask for however much money people are willing to pay for their products.",1366995367

1) The code smells bad--I've had code that's useful, but that I feel is really ugly--but even that I've released when people have asked because it's better than having it just sitting around
2)  To gain papers--for example, once I needed maxent for something and a guy wouldn't release his source and wanted to run that portion of the problem to be a co-author--so, I just wrote my own
3)  Competitive advantage--like the OP says, he wants to keep an edge by having code that other people don't.   Personally, I prefer to keep an edge by doing better science.  I think if you're coming up with software that others use, then you still get some indirect credit from it, but I think that things progress better if the code is available and everyone isn't wasting time reinventing the wheel--it also helps for error-checking.",1366995285

That in combination with that extensions needs to be compiled and distributed which requires infrastructure to ""build the build"". Sure it's easy to google and download the source, even recompile, setup a place where the plugins can be used from (custom and patched ones) but it is still extra overhead that would not be needed at all with (for instance) an interpreted language.<p>An interpreted language is simply a more sensible choice for these kind of things.

The trouble is, they're now wrapped up in overly-aggressive marketing tactics. The videos now have a YouTube ad and a 15 second intro lead-in that reminds me of the THX intro clip [1]. This is followed by an advertisement for other products, followed by the actual content, followed by the spammiest looking ""click subscribe!"" clip. If you visit his website for the first time, you're now immediately greeted with a popup asking to subscribe to their email list. Again, really great content wrapped up in unempathetic marketing tactics. Last time I shared something he'd created on a targeted subreddit, everyone immediately bitched it was spam and it was downvoted; they missed the content because of yucky marketing.<p>Every time I'd post a link, pre-unempathetic marketing, it would (apparently) net him a lot of traffic and reach a previously untapped audience. (I'd get a thank-you email for the huge spike in traffic!) Social media traffic is harder to convert but can be done quite effectively when done properly. What this person can't measure is my current unwillingness to continue to share his best content because of these overly aggressive, unempathetic tactics. I put up with them and still consume his content because I know it's good and it appeals to my interests, but it seems to make newbies bounce very quickly.<p>There are marketing tactics that ""work"" and will result in a positive bump in metrics but have an ick-factor to them and hidden cost. Same deal with on-boarding emails, nagging emails, jQuery popups begging for an email address, etc. They have tangible results and appear to be working, but the undetectable damage is still present.<p>My general rule of thumb is that if you wouldn't want someone to subject you to the tactic, don't subject others.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfg9DVwOd9w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfg9DVwOd9w</a>",1366994327

All the forced swimming test does is measure the time it takes for them to stop paddling.<p>As far as ""torturing"" goes, in the US academic studies require submission of protocols to an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee with proof that any harm caused to an animal is necessary for the study and meets federal guidelines for animal care (and because funding tends to come from federal sources, there is good incentive to meet these requirements). For studies involving pain, nerve regrowth after an insult, or other similar lines of research, injury may be unavoidable in asking the research question, but how the injury is applied must be approved by these committees. Protocols that involve harming an animal tend to be the most stringently regulated by these bodies, even more so than protocols requiring euthanasia. Furthermore, it is usually in the interest of the scientists performing the research to treat their animals consistently well, lest they find themselves with some inexplicable variables to account for.<p>Now, whether all or any of that merely constitutes ""permitted"" torture for our own benefit is a different question, but we do try to ensure that animals are treated as well as possible in a given research context.",1366993753

I just wanted to understand what had made them so mad and to rectify it or at least stop it happening again.<p>With my app reinstated in the app store the worst was over, but still that stain of a very bad review.

The main problem is that the people selling the tickets <i>don't care</i> who buys them.<p>I know, there'll be arguments that Apple should look after it's most devoted fans, but the same applies to any band / artist. If the current biggest fans don't get tickets, the band / artist don't really care as they've sold the tickets to people who will be the <i>next</i> biggest fans. What the companies / artists / promoters are forgetting is that their customers now have the ability to communicate <i>very</i> quickly and effectively with each other. This leads to lots of public, negative feedback. This isn't currently a large enough effect to change system.<p>Thankfully, with this problem existing in a much larger space than software developer's conferences, the negative feedback effect should become quantifiably apparent to various music promoters well before it becomes apparent to any developer's conference promoters, and the pattern will change.<p>In both cases I see this being a variant on some form of loyalty reward. Maybe, if you buy the album / release an app, you get (for example) 10 minutes advance notice for ticket purchases. I can see this working, but it will take a while for the ecosystem to work out the correct ratio of loyalty to reward.<p>I hope it happens soon, I'm sick of missing out on concert tickets because they sold out in half a second.

It really isn't.<p>There are a lot of advocacy organizations (EPIC, etc) that like to bluster about what it does. Right now EPIC is blustering that it's part of authorizing a secret program.<p>What they didn't tell you is that this is their real goal is to gain possible congressional support for the FOIA request they filed, they are just trying to tie it all together so they can gain support from CISPA haters.<p>A lot of these advocacy orgs that lobby are good in the sense of trying to do what they think is right but they often present pretty extreme (IMHO) interpretations of bills/laws and viewpoints to support this.<p>Full disclosure: I have interned at one of these advocacy orgs before (CDT).<p>It's true the government  would be happy if they could monitor everyone's activity, but that isn't CISPA, and crying wolf repeatedly about every bill just makes people less likely to care.

  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>This text might not appear, <i>if</i> it 
  is ever edited-in-place.</p>
  {% endreplaceable %}
</code></pre>
When edited, the module would derive a deterministic unique key for the modified HTML and store in the database. Future redisplays would use the edited text. (Optional parameters might help control how the unique key is derived, from either actual access URI or template name, to affect the range of pages over which one edited-replacement-text appears.)",1366992077

629981,comment,629908,629908,0,0,mannicken,,,"Thank you, Bush administration. You brought us so many wonderful things: Patriot Act, PROTECT act, economy disaster, NCLB, and other heaps of bullshit as well as killing and torturing thousands if innocent people.<p>Why are we not prosecuting Bush&co? Oh, very easy. It's not because he&co aren't evil (because they most certainly fucking are). In our world, might makes the right -- the one with power is the one with enough propaganda powers (and just powers) to make himself right.<p>And you ask me why I hate religion and wasps.. this is why :) It hides evil under the mask of morality and goodness.",1243504071
629979,comment,629843,629843,0,0,thristian,,,"Rather than mentally mapping REST verbs onto traditional CRUD verbs, I recall a quote from TBL to the effect of ""Uniform Resource Locator is the term you get when you squeeze 'remote object reference' through a standards process"". I think of PUT as being like Python's __init__ method, constructing a new instance with the given details; DELETE is like Python's __del__ method, cleaning up references and removing it; GET is like Python's __str__ method, returning a readable representation of the object's state, and POST is like Python's __call__, invoking the object as a function with some given arguments and who-knows-what side-effects.",1243503954

Liquidation Preferences sound like a preference for who has the right to drink from the water cooler first.  And metaphorically, that is correct.  They say who drinks from the proceeds from the sale of a company first.",1243503946
629977,comment,628532,628607,0,0,moshez,,,"""As for why lisp has been left behind in favor of other languages? Well, it's pretty much the same reason as why few people in America wear bowler hats these days, they're out of fashion.""<p>But wait, I'm not understanding what you're trying to say. Bowler hats are a fashion, yes. But if I do wear a bowler hat, other than getting ridiculed, there is no effect on my life. I'm not suddenly three times smarter or more effective at work. If bowler hats made you three times smarter, even if they were out of fashion, I'm sure plenty of people would wear them. If LISP doesn't make me three times as efficient as $LANGUAGE, then, yes, it's merely a matter of fashion that it is not more popular -- but maybe it's also no big deal. Is that the point you were trying to make? Because if it isn't, blaming ""fashion"" is not advancing your case.",1243503931

629969,comment,629879,629946,0,0,andreyf,,,"<i>Wouldn't that be a bit like having every scientist invent their own jargon?</i><p>I don't know about ""all scientists"", but mathematicians do precisely this <i>all the time</i>! Each paper and each textbook begins by defining what symbols mean what, and which terms are used how. But a textbook is about as big a consistent block of terminology as you'll be able to find. In a grander sense, terms are constantly re-purposed and evolving over time [1].<p>Something as simple as ""âŠ‚"" will mean ""subset"" in one book, and ""strict subset"" in another. In my experience, the older the book, the more divergent it'll be from current usage. This suggests that the language of mathematics evolves over time, precisely <i>because</i> every practitioner can change the language and push for her own terminology. There is no ""Mathematics corporation"" which creates languages people would be forced to choose from - no mathematician, no matter how great, would suggest that he would know what the ""eternally right way"" of expressing mathematics is.<p>This is especially apparent in more exploratory parts, where definitions start being named after their authors. I, personally, look forward to a time when I get to choose between a Norvig-garbage-collection and Graham-garbage-collection for each object in my code.<p>We're in this ridiculous stage of software engineering, where, if you're using Java, you have to do garbage collection The Java Way (you get to set a couple of settings, but that's it). No mathematician would ever be forced to make the decisions that Sun's engineers were forced to make when designing Java, because nobody could make those decisions correctly - how programs must interact with the call stack, the mechanics of method invocation, etc.<p>1.

629966,comment,629792,629961,0,0,brl,,,"Yes I would agree as most of the advice in the book is more common sense than groundbreaking.  When I got to the part about not telling people ""You're wrong"" and directly criticizing mistakes I didn't need to be convinced.  Rather I immediately realized that I do tend to do this often and I should probably make an effort to do it less.<p>Before reading the book though, I had never once examined that aspect of my personality and how I interact with others.",1243502393
629965,comment,628436,629349,0,0,brl,,,"The Berne Convention is much too old to specifically address the bare licenses used for open-source software.  However one of the provisions of the convention is that any creative work is protected under copyright law without requiring explicit registration.  This creates a problem for declaring something in the public domain since there is not really an established legal procedure for a copyright owner to waive or forfeit the exclusive rights which have been automatically granted to them.",1243501906

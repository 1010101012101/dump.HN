7133173,comment,7132611,7132611,7,0,User8712,,,"The article brings up a good point, sometimes it makes more sense to start with the person. For example, let&#x27;s say I need to get in touch with my friend to quickly inform them of a change to our plans.<p>Open Skype? Not online. Check Facebook, nope, they&#x27;re not on. Messenger? Nope. Ok, I&#x27;ll open my contact book, and get their number to call.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to simply select the person I&#x27;m trying to reach, and see what platforms they&#x27;re online, so I can choose my contact method?<p>Or what if I want to see what&#x27;s new with one friend? I should be able to click their name, and see their facebook changes, new tweets, status updates, etc.<p>Of course, this isn&#x27;t always the case, I might want to open Facebook without plans to browse a particular person, or I might open Skype just to see who&#x27;s online that I can video call.<p>So, there are times when I need to take both routes. They should both be available so I can choose either. It&#x27;s complicated to aggregate content from a variety of sources into a single page, so it&#x27;s not a surprise why this option isn&#x27;t frequently available. You would almost need a new standard, so HN could provide an API for a user&#x27;s comments, posts, etc, and Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc, all do the same. Then I can build an app that merges all of this information together. So a user opens the app, and creates a page for John, enters John&#x27;s Facebook profile, Twitter/Reddit/HN handles, and everything appears in a single place. However, these sources then get less direct traffic, and therefore less revenue, so it&#x27;s unlikely they would jump on-board.",1390856273

7133165,comment,7131885,7132522,6,0,jarrett,,,"I&#x27;m admittedly new to the language, but my convention has been as follows:<p>Declare types of all named functions (i.e. not lambdas). This serves two purposes.<p>First, it makes your code more self-documenting. When I look at a function, probably the first thing I want to know is: &quot;What are its parameters?&quot; Type declarations on functions give you a trustworthy and highly readable answer to that question.<p>Second, it makes type errors easier to understand. If you don&#x27;t explicitly declare types, the compiler will perform type inference. When your code has a type error, the compiler can infer a nonsensical type for a function, yielding a hard-to-understand error message. If your function has a type declaration, the error message is more likely to point you to where your actual mistake is.<p>Rarely declare types on anything that&#x27;s not a top-level function definition. For example, if I want to call (foo (bar baz)), I don&#x27;t need to add separate type declarations to baz, (bar baz), and (foo (bar baz)), even though each quite possibly has a different type. On the other hand, if you want to remind yourself of the type of some inner expression, or you think it&#x27;ll make the type errors more readable, you can add the declaration. It won&#x27;t hurt you.",1390856205

I get this.  I am not a great programmer.  I&#x27;m self taught like a lot of you.  I had tremendous difficulty grokking TDD and for the longest time I&#x27;d start, give up, build without it.<p>But, I&#x27;m here as a you-can-do-it-to.  You might not think you want to but I&#x27;m so glad I DID manage to get there.<p>Feel free to ignore because I respect that everyone&#x27;s experience differs.  But the real problem is that there are few good step by step tutorials that teach you from start to competent with TDD. Couple that with the fact that it takes real time to learn good TDD practices and the vast majority of TDDers in their early stage write too many tests, bad tests, and tightly couple tests.<p>Just as it&#x27;s taken you time to learn programming - I don&#x27;t mean hello world, but getting to the competent level with coding you&#x27;re at today, it&#x27;ll take a long time to get good with TDD.  My case (ruby ymmv) involved googling every time I struggled; lots of Stack Overflow; plenty of Confreaks talks; Sandi Metz&#x27; POODR...<p>Like the OP says - at different stages in the learning cycles you take different approaches because you&#x27;re better, it&#x27;s more instinctive to you.  I thought I understood the purpose of mocks/doubles, until I actually understood the purpose of mocks/doubles.  When used right they&#x27;re fantastic.<p>The key insight that everyone attempting TDD has to grok, before all else, is that it&#x27;s about design not regression testing.  If you&#x27;re struggling to write tests, and they&#x27;re hard to write, messy, take a lot of setup, are slow to run, too tightly coupled etc. you have a design problem.  It&#x27;s exposed.  Think through your abstractions.  Refactor.  Always refactor.  Don&#x27;t do RED-GREEN-GOOD ENOUGH ... I did for a long time.  It was frustrating.<p>This is a good post.  Don&#x27;t dismiss TDD because you&#x27;re struggling.  Try to find better learning tools and practice lots and listen to others who are successful with it.<p>It&#x27;s true that sometimes fads take hold and we can dismiss them as everyone doing something for no reason.  But cynicism can take hold too and we can think that of everything and miss good tools and techniques.  TDD will help you be a better coder - at least it has me.

You could call it a &quot;conflict zone&quot;, a term that could be applied to the vast majority of the developing world.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this preoccupation with &quot;declared wars.&quot; Who cares what you call it? The government simply does not have control over vast swaths of Yemen, and militant groups unaligned with the government are using it as a base of operations for attacks on people outside of Yemen. No, this does not characterize the vast majority of the developing world. Places like Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia are in a totally different situation.<p>> Terrorists are really bad criminals. Are you able to draw a bright line between the two? If not, then what&#x27;s the use of the distinction?<p>The line doesn&#x27;t have to be bright, but it&#x27;s crucial to draw the line. There is crime, and there is war, and the two are not the same thing. The regime applicable to external threats versus internal threats is very different. Maintaining this distinction allows you to better preserve the protections applicable to domestic criminal prosecution. If you try to shoe-horn well-financed international terrorists armed with military grade weapons into the framework of domestic criminal law, you end up distorting that framework and militarizing the domestic law enforcement apparatus. That&#x27;s bad.<p>>  He was never uniformed, he was not in a declared war zone, and he was not a citizen of a foreign nation.<p>You&#x27;re elevating formality over reality. Al Awlaki wasn&#x27;t unambiguously a foreign soldier, but aside from his U.S. citizenship he essentially acted like one. If a state affiliated actor had done the same thing, it would be considered an act of war.<p>> Am I mistaken?<p>Some procedural rights cannot be waived, and a constitutionally valid trial cannot be conducted without meeting that requirement. The historical understanding in the U.S. has been that trials in abstentia are unconstitutional, at least for capital cases. To date, the Supreme Court hasn&#x27;t directly addressed the Constitutional issue (though it strongly implied it in Diaz v. U.S. in 1912), but has held that a trial in which a defendant is not present in the beginning of trial is defective for violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 43 (Crosby v. U.S.)<p>From a practical viewpoint, trials in abstentia are a far more dangerous precedent than drone strikes. Sovereign countries already reserve the right to kill foreigners if they feel attacked by external threats. You can sugar-coat it with international agreements and treaties and whatnot, but fundamentally, every nation, as against external threats, embraces the sovereign right to kill people in other countries. That&#x27;s the foundational basis for war.<p>The precedent for trials in abstentia in the context of domestic criminal prosecutions, however, is novel and scary in the U.S. and it&#x27;s a stone better left unturned. It&#x27;s better, for people back at home, to just say that people like Al Awlaki, through their long absence and actions abroad, simply relinquish their rights as U.S. citizens and can be treated as foreign enemies. Because you don&#x27;t <i>want</i> the ramifications of the government figuring out how to deal with guys like him within the framework of domestic criminal enforcement.",1390854950

Here&#x27;s a sample:<p><pre><code>  GT: There are two cameras. One is a classic, push-broom,   \n  medium-resolution, four-band imager. It is built for space \n  with our partner Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL). \n  They had this camera available, it could be built \n  relatively inexpensively, it isn’t particularly large, and \n  it is made for space, so it became a good fit. At the \n  altitude at which the space station flies it gives you a \n  5.5 meter pixel size on the ground or ground sampling \n  distance (GSD).\n\n  The other thing that made this project possible is that \n  RSC Energia and Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, had \n  already decided to experiment with a camera on the ISS. \n  They had defined the experiment, rolled it all up, and \n  obtained the approval of all the partners, but had not \n  decided what the camera would be. So, when we came along, \n  they loved the idea, and they already had, essentially, a \n  programmatic way to enable it immediately. They had also \n  developed a very high accuracy pointing platform that can \n  point to plus or minus 175 degrees in each of two axes, \n  which means that you can steer it to track a point on the \n  ground. You can also flip it up and look at space targets. \n  Once this project got traction with them — and they liked \n  it a lot — they had a competition to decide who would get \n  to use their pointing platform. We participated and they \n  decided to give the platform to our project. We are very \n  happy about that. That’s what enabled the video cam.\n\n  We are typically able to track a spot on the ground for a \n  minute and a half and take video or images. To make it \n  work and get good resolution you need to have that kind of \n  pointing system. To build it from scratch would have been \n  quite expensive. The video camera has an aperture of 32 \n  centimeters, so it is essentially an astronomy telescope. \n  It was built by an American company and over the past year \n  has been ruggedized, so that it is suitable for space. The \n  manufacturer already had the parts for this telescope \n  because they built one for another customer and had some \n  spare parts that we were able to buy right away. We were \n  able to put it on a test stand to check it for vibration \n  and work out whether it was possible to make it suitable \n  for space, which we confirmed last summer. So, very \n  quickly that gave us a telescope of the right size and \n  performance and at the right price point for our project. \n\n  As for the detector, we are are using a commercial 18 \n  MegaPixel detector from a professional grade DSLR camera \n  that we have radiation tested to ensure it will work in \n  space. The camera electronics is built by RAL, who are \n  leveraging their extensive know-how and technology they \n  have developed for the numerous other optical instruments \n  they built for space. There is nothing really special \n  about the technology, other than that we couldn’t do a \n  NASA-style development costing many tens of millions of \n  dollars. It is a commercial project and it has to be \n  affordable.</code></pre>",1390854852

This equally applies for any Java platform too as the VM performance characteristics don&#x27;t resemble any from the Sun/Oracle family.<p>The key thing is to understand what is involved to get an Android app to start up. This is terrifying when considering just the Dalvik case, but what most C++ types don&#x27;t realise is that even if your app is using NativeActivity it means you are really subclassing this:\n<a href=""https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/app/NativeActivity.java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/mas...</a><p>This means in order to load the native lib you first have to load Dalvik, a whole load of classes relevant to the app, allocate the whole Dalvik heap for the app, and then you rely on the Dalvik code to initiate loading of the native lib. As a result this only becomes worth doing if the gains you&#x27;re going to make exceed those losses, but I find it&#x27;s quite common for people to ignore the downside, as a few comments here indicate.<p>Storage to RAM bandwidth on these things is not exactly stellar, so as a consequence loading takes a while. To make things worse if you want to deploy all supported native architectures you&#x27;re multiplying the native code size by four, since you will want two ARM builds (v5 and v7), one MIPS, and an x86. As a consequence I&#x27;m unaware of anyone that habitually includes all of them, and just putting ARMv7 libs in is the norm.",1390854507

The point of a TM is not that it &quot;literally&quot; (to the extent that term applies anyhow) has &quot;infinite&quot; cells in it, the point is that there is no point in the computation in which it will reach for another cell and be told that there isn&#x27;t one. (So there isn&#x27;t even a way to represent that.) Many &quot;infinite&quot; things are better conceived of as &quot;unbounded&quot;. For another example, &quot;infinite lists&quot; in Haskell. Obviously, they can not concretely manifest infinitely many cells in memory, but there is no point at which the runtime will reach for &quot;the next cell&quot; and be told it has reached the end of the list.<p>That is also why it&#x27;s better to model our real computers with TM math, even though they obviously do not have literally infinite amounts of memory. As long as a software process runs along and is never told that it is out of memory when it asks for more, we get fairly TM-like behavior, or we get a crash if it does run out. By contrast, while the FSM model is in some sense more mathematically accurate, it is less <i>useful</i> for modeling real computers, since it is so weak.<p>I think this formulation also better intuitively explains why we use infinity so often in our proofs; by saying &quot;and there&#x27;s always another one if you want it&quot;, we remove the case where we have to handle there <i>not</i> being another one. And that case can get quite hairy, as anyone who has watched their machine self-immolate after it discovers it is out of RAM can attest to. :) (It can also be every bit as mathematically tedious to deal with, too.)<p>The further I got through grad school, the more I said &quot;unbounded&quot; rather than &quot;infinite&quot;.",1390854262

For one thing, large companies typically have far more efficient financials. For example, revolving loans are common to smooth over cash flow bumps and due to their size they can demand long payment terms (120 days or longer to pay for stuff). There&#x27;s definitely an advantage there.<p>Large businesses also have a regulatory advantage, since they write the actual regulations that govern themselves (at least in the United States).<p>Nevertheless, IMO while these are significant, I don&#x27;t think they are the overwhelming reason why big businesses have 4x the revenue per employee. Regulatory overhead is real, but it&#x27;s not 4x, and better financials certainly help with <i>profitability</i>, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re responsible for bringing in 4x the revenue per employee, either.<p>I honestly think IT is the thing that counts the most (Amdahl&#x27;s Law) if you want to see SMBs become competitive, at least on a revenue per employee basis, with the Global 2000.<p>It&#x27;s not just lack of IT investment that hurts SMBs. Even when they <i>do</i> invest in IT, they use it differently than the Global 2000, and that difference is, IMO, why SMBs are relatively inefficient, and why gains from IT haven&#x27;t trickled down to them.<p>But hey, I could be wrong. It is, after all, just my opinion after studying the problem. YMMV and all that.<p><i>> How about the fact that they can make large investments in general (for example, build a pipeline or a nuclear power plant), at the scale where few competitors exist?</i><p>Sure, that helps, but revenue is regulated by law in the two cases you mentioned. And the Global 2000 is not <i>primarily</i> made up of companies doing large capital investments in infrastructure. Furthermore, the 1:4 relationship exists <i>across</i> industries. So we&#x27;re not comparing apple&#x27;s to oranges here. Even within the <i>exact same industry</i> the Global 2000 has a 4x advantage in revenue per employee.<p>Like I said, I don&#x27;t think you can explain a 4x advantage in revenue per employee solely with better financial management and regulatory efficiencies.",1390853675

If that&#x27;s a description of an upgrade of Rails apps, I think it is overblown frankly, unless it involves new developers coming in blind to an app and trying to update - in that situation, whatever the framework, there is going to be pain - the pain of not knowing the app or dependencies added to any upgrade glitches can lead to a lot of trouble.<p>I do think the article made a mistake in mixing up security/infrastructure updates with framework and app updates. It comes off as vague, wooly and somewhat deceptive to the client.<p><i>It&#x27;s quite another to maintain, rewrite, and retain compatibility with existing apps and infrastructure.</i><p>Done a fair bit of this (though less of the rewriting). Frankly, Rails is much like any other framework in this respect - things mostly change gradually, and they make a good effort at backwards compatibility, but it&#x27;s not always perfect; it&#x27;s not much worse than other frameworks, though I&#x27;m sure some others do a better job (with other tradeoffs). The move from 2-3 was the biggest, but even that wasn&#x27;t particularly troubling for me - it could be harder with very large, complex apps, but those apps usually have a team looking after them and money to spend on upgrades/maintenance.<p>The worst place to be in is coming in to a new app which is broken and out of date, or just badly structured, and trying to fix it - this pain occurs in any language that I&#x27;m familiar with, and I suspect that&#x27;s the reason for a lot of rewriting.

7132828,comment,7130668,7132519,7,0,stiff,,,"Apps of how many LOCs have you migrated?<p>I have been migrating one and the same Rails app from version to version for around 5 years now, and we are currently at around 50k lines of code. When you are taking about &quot;couple hours of work&quot; and &quot;painless&quot; I can only laugh out loud. Every new minor or major Rails version migration takes several weeks with any larger app, only patch versions can be migrated reasonably smoothly. Migration from Rails 2.3 to Rails 3.0 was a particular catastrophe, it took me more than a month of intensive work, after the switch the application became twice as slow, which turned out to be a regression in the PostgreSQL driver that went unnoticed for a year since Rails 3.0 was first released. Just diagnosing this single issue took me a week of frustration, where I step by step peeled the onion of abstraction upon abstraction, having to profile Rails internals in the end.<p>We are now looking into the Rails 3 -> Rails 4 migration, and it&#x27;s not much better, after just changing the gems the application won&#x27;t start, the console won&#x27;t start, and the tests run into an infinite recursion and explode the stack. I routinely spend a week even to get just those three basic things to start at all, and it was this way even when migrating 1.x to 2.x. After every upgrade of this kind, some gems turn out to be abandoned are not upgraded by the authors to support the newer Rails, and seldom they will work with them without changes. The ones that were updated, often require a separate upgrade procedure of their own, there goes another week. Just fixing all the deprecation warnings will take another one. It&#x27;s not just strong parameters, a lot of the old routing code does not work, conditions on relations don&#x27;t work anymore, config settings become obsolete and so on and so forth, 80% of the things that have to be changed are not even in the release notes, for example Rails 4.0 happened to introduce an internal Options class that is visible from every controller and shadows our global Options constant which is the object with application configuration.<p>It does not mean Rails &quot;sucks&quot; or anything like this, but keeping a very nice API while adapting a framework to requirements evolving over the years has the cost of sucking at compatibility, that&#x27;s just a fact of software engineering. So please lets not pretend the Rails team top priority is ease of long term maintenance and lets put things as they are. If you are not systematically keeping up with newer Rails version, after half a year or 9 months since the last update you won&#x27;t even receive bugfixes, because they often aren&#x27;t backported even to the previous minor version. That the 37signals guys threw out their own biggest app and rewritten it from scratch is also telling about their attitude to things of this kind. So Rails is bad at compatibility, in exchange it keeps delivering a really nice API for a wider and wider scope of tasks.",1390853390

I can only notice two things here:<p>1. The argument can apply to absolutely any other aspect of life - if it&#x27;s useful, criminals can use it, so the government should have tight control on it. For example, criminal enterprises are much easier to conduct if you can move around on the roads freely. We can not have that, ergo we have to institute regular routine checkpoints where you have to routinely prove to the law enforcement officers you are going around on legitimate business and they should keep the database of all your movements and require all road operators to report all your movement to the government movement tracking center, in case you later prove to be a criminal. Etc., etc.<p>2. You can not have both money laundering laws and bitcoin (or any non-governmental money system) as it is now. If you keep the former, the government will either subjugate or shut down the latter. Either bitcoin loses virtually all its anonymity and distributed control features and allows the government to control it the same way it controls regular money, with same regulations and roadblocks, or mere touching bitcoin or related technologies will become a crime. You can see how it works with drugs - anything that can be classified as related to drugs or precursor to drugs or can be used in relation to anything to do with drugs is outlawed. Bitcoin will inevitably follow one of these roads - or maybe both.",1390853258

I think the author&#x27;s solution is a good one, though it still doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem around what you do if you realize you got something wrong and need to refactor things.<p>Over the years I personally have moved to writing some of the integration tests first, basically defining the API and the contracts that I feel like are the least likely to change, then breaking things down into the pieces that I think are necessary, but only really filling in unit tests once I&#x27;m pretty confident that the structure is basically correct and won&#x27;t require major refactorings in the near future (and often only for those pieces whose behavior is complicated enough that the integration tests are unlikely to catch all the potential bugs).<p>I think there sometimes needs to be a bit more honest discussion about things like:\n* When TDD isn&#x27;t a good idea (say, when prototyping things, or when you don&#x27;t yet know how you want to structure the system)\n* Which tests are the most valuable, and how to identify them\n* The different ways in which tests can provide value (in ensuring the system is designed for testability, in identifying bugs during early implementation, in providing a place to hang future regression tests, in enabling debugging of the system, in preventing regressions, etc.), what kinds of tests provide what value, and how to identify when they&#x27;re no longer providing enough value to justify their continued maintenance\n* What to do when you have to do a major refactoring that kills hundreds of tests (i.e. how much is it worth it to rewrite those unit tests?)\n* That investment in testing is an ROI equation (as with everything), and how to evaluate the true value the tests are giving you against the true costs of writing and maintaining them\n* All the different failure modes of TDD (e.g. the unit tests work but the system as a whole is broken, mock hell, expensive refactorings, too many tiny pieces that make it hard to follow anything) and how to avoid them or minimize their cost<p>Sometimes it seems like the high level goals, i.e. shipping high-quality software that solves a user&#x27;s problems, get lost in the dogma around how to meet those goals.",1390853254

7132782,comment,7107215,7110316,1,0,Jehar,,,"Can I attempt to clarify the perceived intention of Tarkovsky with his novel adaptation? I wouldn&#x27;t frame the films as evidence that he didn&#x27;t care about the source material or what it attempted to say. Rather, it seems to me that these films are his <i>responses</i> to the novels, or at least meditations on what the novels said to Tarkovsky.<p>Another factor is that film and literature are very different languages, and aiming for a 1:1 translation can often result in a work that is missing pieces that were only communicable in the original. \nIf we acknowledge that any given novel will have aspects of it that are un-filmable (interior monologue, relative time dilation, for simple examples), then it is the job of the director to re-create the spirit of those aspects while making them work for his media. As a result, the director cannot help but inject his own views and thoughts into the work. \nNobody embodies this more strongly to me than Tarkovsky, with Kubrick as a close second. In fact, King&#x27;s own attempt (shudder) at filming The Shining may prove this point all by itself; it&#x27;s apparent that King doesn&#x27;t understand the medium he was attempting to use.",1390852939

R runs in the bottom window, and the source file I&#x27;m editing is in the top. This lets me send code to R for evaluation and supports an incremental style of development. I&#x27;ll slowly build up functions, and this sometimes requires editing functions that my current function uses. This style of development is typical for people using R, Matlab, Lisp, or any language featuring a REPL. But you can&#x27;t do it in Julia.<p>This is what everyone does in Julia too, with Emacs, IJulia, and others. Here is how to do it: put &quot;module X&quot; at the beginning of your file, and an extra &quot;end&quot; as the last line. Each time you send the file to Julia, the module is recompiled, and inter-dependent functions are updated to the latest version. Problem solved. This is mentioned (in a slightly different context) in the FAQ:<p><a href=""http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.2/manual/faq/#how-can-i-modify-the-declaration-of-a-type-immutable-in-my-session"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.2/manual/faq/#how-can...</a><p>But I admit it&#x27;s not immediately obvious, and we should probably put it front-and-center somewhere.",1390852807

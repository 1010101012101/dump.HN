I'll try to summarize as best I can:<p>The main calculation in the Nature paper is the energy budget of a cell. They give the example of <i>E. coli</i>: ""to raise gene number tenfold, <i>E. coli</i> must also increase its energy budget by close to tenfold; and therein lies the problem."" The reason so much more energy is required is due to protein synthesis (DNA codes to RNA which codes proteins, if you're unfamiliar with genetics). So obviously with a larger genome, there's more proteins to synthesize, and this cannot be accomplished by simply making fewer copies of the old proteins. If anything, you need <i>more</i> of some of those original proteins as infrastructure support for this new Genome 2.0.<p>So (and this is my wording) prokaryotes are at a local maximum for genome and cell size. Chucking mitochondria into the picture provides the wattage (literally) for them to reach a much greater genome and cell size, and therefore organismic complexity.",1287672981

And yes, taxing people for producing value with their own labor is wrong to me. This is not an argument that all taxation is bad. You need taxes to run society. But taxing earned income seems wrong to me - the government doesn't own you, nor does it own your labor. I believe that. It's your life, you own it, and you own the product of your hands and mind. You should pay for the property you use, which effectively means you're paying for wherever you receive services. Wealthier people tend to use more property, meaning they pay more naturally.

Neither, it seems is evolution...  DNA codes for proteins (etc) that builds structures, and frameworks, and other 'stuff' (eg: there are more neurons than DNA letters : there must be some meta-coding going on).<p>Genetic Programming (Koza, etc) seems like a step in the right direction (since manipulating trees can lead to structures with as much complexity as 'desired' by the evolution bit).  But it's still not quite right IMHO, since it's all operating at the 'language' level (mutation of symbols that themselves perform the computation).  For an example from nature : Our brains don't work through the interaction of DNA, they work through the interaction of stuff whose precursor (during the person-building stage) was DNA.<p>If standard GA manipulates the parameters of a problem, then GP is manipulating a tree that codes for the parameters of a problem.  The next step up would be manipulating a language that builds the tree.  How many meta steps should we make?  Isn't that a search problem too?",1287672836

If so, you're experienced enough to get a job as a developer.  What you need to work on is not your programming ability -- that is what professional experience is for -- but your competence at marketing yourself.<p>You will probably not be hired to fill a hole labeled ""I need a developer who does RoR, jQuery, Rspec, and Cucumber.""  First, most of the people who need exactly that skillset don't have the budget to hire anybody.  (No offense to present company who may use exactly that skillset.)  Second, most developers start with semi-relevant experience and gradually learn more about the stack their current job (or project at the job) involves.  I was a Big Freaking Java Web Apps dev for 3 years and I started not knowing SQL, Spring, etc etc.  That was fine -- it just meant my first several months involved doing an awful lot of iterating over hashmaps (java.util.* is my second home) when not reading code and tutorials.<p>Now, in terms of marketing yourself:<p>1)  Make stuff you can show off.

(Actually, it might be #2 after communication skills.)<p>2)  Polish your communication skills.  See #1.<p>3)  Start networking.  ""Send a resume and pray"" is jobseeking for people who enjoy unemployment.  Know the decisionmaker beforehand.  There are a variety of ways you can get started on this today -- for example, start writing a blog about the kinds of problems you have solved or will eventually solve for the kinds of people who will hire you.  This gives you something to talk about.  Alternatively, talk about what other people are writing in the same field.

I'm not asking this rhetorically to make a point. Really, should they?<p>I would imagine that whatever profits are passed along to shareholders are taxed as capital gains. So, while it is a great headline to say Google pays 2.4% corporate tax, might it also be fair to say ""Google shareholders pay 2.4% additional tax on top of the regular tax they pay on their income from capital ownership.""?<p>Now, I'm not at all aware of how capital gains taxes and wage-style income taxes compare, and my inner liberal slant / desire for social justice inclines me to believe that those with the means should pay MORE than their ""fair"" share.<p>But I can't help but think that, at least at a theoretical level, there is someone, somewhere, who makes their living investing in corporations - lubricating the gears of capital society - but isn't phenomenally wealthy, and actually pays a total higher % of their ""income"" than a wage slave making a comparable amount of money. VCs? Angels? Wouldn't we as a society want to reward this behavior?<p>I can just as easily see the other side; maybe in theory this is right, but the reality is that capital gains are the domain of the ultra-wealthy, and corporations are frequently used as tax havens, pushing money around from holding company to holding company. If the corporation buys something and the owner uses it, that's an effective way to minimize your total ""income"" without losing the benefits of your wealthy lifestyle.<p>I would love to hear thoughts on this, particularly from anyone more familiar with tax law.",1287671665

I understand that governments might want to consider these as loopholes and seek to end the right of U.S. taxpayers to avail themselves of these tax-minimization strategies. But, as long as it <i>is</i> legal, why should a company voluntarily seek to expose itself to higher tax rates when it has the choice not to?<p>I guess when you as a company claim the high ground (""do no evil""), you will have people making their own judgments about what ethical standard ought to govern your conduct and this would explain this professor's remark. By that measure, though, one could argue that companies such as Google should seek to attribute all their revenues to California because that is where their main intellectual property development efforts have occurred and hence pay corporate tax rates at one of the highest rates around simply because they ""owe"" it to California.<p>I get this question all the time from web-based startups: why run our revenues through a high-tax state when we have the option of running them through all sorts of lower-tax venues and saving on taxes? The universal answer for smaller companies is ""set your company up in a way that let's you pay the least tax you can legally.""<p>Why should Google be held to a different standard on penalty of having its perfectly legal actions castigated as ""evil""? Is it the view of some or many in the HN community, for example, that a private enterprise has a form of ""social responsibility"" to voluntarily subject itself to the tax rates of whatever domicile it happens to have its major operations in (in this case, California) when it legally has the option not to do so?

The ""Edit Profile"" button below the primary navigation could be removed and replaced with a hover invitation link next to the user's name or perhaps by clicking the profile photo, further reducing the number of elements competing for attention.  On a related note, could ""My Tasks"" be removed since it is already displayed prominently in the main content area?<p>5.  On ""Case"" pages, the actions displayed below the primary navigation are difficult to visually scan and parse.  This is compounded by the fact that unrelated buttons share colors, making it difficult for the user to create a mental model and anticipate expected behavior.  A dropdown menu of options might be more appropriate to show all available actions in this case, and would further reduce overall noise.<p>6.  There is another usability issue to consider with the buttons placed directly below the primary navigation bar.  If I run the cursor too close to the top of the target area for the buttons, I can easily trigger a dropdown hover from one of the primary navigation menu items above it.  That could get frustrating in everyday use.<p>Have you done any structured usability or task completion testing with real users yet?  Check out Steve Krug's book ""Rocket Surgery Made Easy"" for some ideas there.  You could also gain a lot of inexpensive insight using services like feedbackarmy.com, userfly.com or loop11.com.

You shouldn't be told ""you can't do that because you might get it wrong."" Let me explain. The model for sharing and locking all that stuff is like having a big piece of paper and we all gather the paper and we make notes on it about who owns what, when -- and we scribble and erase and rewrite and work on it. <i>This</i> model is: you don't have one piece of paper, you have lots of pieces of paper. And you write a message on a piece of paper, and you give him that piece, and he goes away, and you don't have it anymore. He'll bring it back to you if it's relevant to you; he won't if it's not. And because the individual pieces are broken up, there's no concern or worry about who owns what at any one time -- it's whoever's got ahold of it at the moment. And once you understand that, it just doesn't come up as an issue, that for efficiency reasons, I want to pass a pointer on a channel, because once I've passed it I forget it. The only person who has it is the person whose business it is to deal with it now. If you're worried about it and you really care: don't pass a pointer, pass a value. Make it a channel of struct, rather than a channel of pointer to struct. It will be a copy, and there's no way you can share it. But that's <i>your</i> decision, not the language's.""",1287670082

It's a great start.  After that, just dive in.  I started writing a chess game using canvas (part of HTML5) and javascript.  It's just been a matter of figuring it out piece by piece from there.  Writing lots of awful code, figuring out why it's awful, tearing it up and doing it again (Javascript: The Good Parts has been a great help).<p>I've managed to learn just enough html/css/javascript to be dangerous, now I'm moving on to server-side programming.  What I like to do is this:  Take an 11""x17"" piece of paper, and write whatever it is I'm trying to learn in the centre and circle it.  As I figure out what I don't know know about this technology, but need to, I draw a branch off the centre circle, for that piece of knowledge.  And I continue to break it down as I go.  This gives me a good visual of things I should start focussing on.<p>As a more concrete example, I'm using python as the backe end to my current side project.  So in the centre of the page is a bubble for python.  Off that I have different things I want to explore, so there is a bubble for Security, WSGI, templating engines, and SQLAlchemy.  Off of security, there are bubbles for server hardening, XSS, etc..<p>Best of luck, there's lots of confussing technologies and non-sensical gotchas, but eventually it does start to make sense.",1287669802

You would still have the issue of people flying end over end and landing on their heads so replace the playing surface with gymnastic mats.  Of course we could still get some joint injury’s so add a protective exoskeleton to prevent over extension etc and then watch as people fling their body’s around and bounce off of each other.<p>It might not be a sport at that point, but it would be an interesting spectacle.",1287669692

Since Apple has been promoting HTML5 web apps, especially those targeting Mobile Safari, I find it hard to believe that their hatred of Flash comes from a desire to protect the App Store.

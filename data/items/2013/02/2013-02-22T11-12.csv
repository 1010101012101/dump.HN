5263822,comment,5263486,5263486,2,0,mathattack,,,"This is a very true post, but I don't think the solution is at the university, at least for undergrads.  Schools barely have enough time in 4 years to create entry level programmers.  Lopping off half the coursework in exchange for domain knowledge leaves grads unprepared.<p>My observation is if you can learn to program well, you can learn any field of knowledge.  A programmer can learn consumer products easier than a brand manager can learn Python.  Similarly a CS major can learn bond math easier than a Finance major can learn database design.  (Yes, these are generalizations)<p>What's this mean?  That bridging the Tech/Client divide is on the shoulder of the technologist.  In addition to learning the latest frameworks, we have to learn our customers business.  In addition to tech credentials, we should add theirs too.",1361534336

Just guessing, but there are a lot of domains out there that are quite diffcult to learn but that are also (or maybe because they are difficult to learn) ripe to be changed by software.<p>I could imagine the right match of domain knowledge and the capability to learn how to develop in a non-tech guy and programming skills and the capability to learn the domain in  a tech guy would be rather powerfull combination. And pretty rare one, I guess. At least for me, the actual programming part is... difficult. ;-)<p>On another point, this applies pretty much things like lean or six sigma, too. Both are quite usefull (or can be, that depends!), but people tend to see them as domain by itself. In practice, and that's only my personal opinion, this comes out short.

Step 4 is problematic because the Firebase server cannot compute who wins; that has to be done on the client.<p>I think I can configure Firebase to validate scores based on some precondition (i.e. 'only allow this value to be increased by one if both players have chosen and declared'). Then clients would reset their choices immediately and scores would be 'locked-in' until the next victory condition is met.

As a result I felt unmotivated and dragged my feet for a very long time. Double clicking on Eclipse and following book instructions on how to make an array in Java for a class wasn't particularly interesting or fun to me. I always chucked it up as not bothering because I wasn't a 'math person', and this was probably something that only people who liked math would do.

5263754,comment,5258955,5263478,3,0,ratherbefuddled,,,"It might be surprising but Scala actually has significantly fewer language features than Java.  It is also more regular, there are fewer special cases and surprises.<p>What Scala has done however is to pick particularly powerful features that are allowed to intersect as much as possible giving a lot of flexibility.  At the same time it has introduced and encouraged functional programming concepts which are new to many OO programmers with Java backgrounds.  This can make it seem a little daunting but I found it no more difficult to learn than any other language and easier than some.<p>The compile times are simply because the compiler is doing a lot more.  It's always going to be slower than the Java compiler, though there are still optimisations that can happen.  That's a trade off, the additional expressivity and safety of the type system is either worth it to you or not.  In the case of Play, you're getting compile time checked routes and templates for example.<p>In terms of reasoning, it is much easier to reason about <i>idiomatic</i> Scala code in isolation than it is Java.  This is because you have much richer type information and can apply the substitution model without being worried about mutation and side affects.  It is true however that the flexibility you are given can be misused and you aren't forced to stick to a functional style, so when someone goes off the reservation that can result in hard to comprehend code.  Most of the FOSS projects I've seen in Scala avoid this but YMMV.",1361532108

Previous technologies had been extensions of physical organs: the wheel is a putting-outside-ourselves of the feet; the city wall is a collective outering of the skin. But electronic media are, instead, extensions of the central nervous system, an inclusive and simultaneous field. Since the telegraph we have extended the brains and nerves of man around the globe. As a result, the electronic age endures a total uneasiness, as of a man wearing his skull inside and his brain outside. We have become peculiarly vulnerable. The year of the establishment of the commercial telegraph in America, 1844, was also the year Kierkegaard published The Concept of Dread.<p>A special property of all social extensions of the body is that they return to plague the inventors in a kind of agenbite of outwit. As Narcissus fell in love with an outering (projection, extension) of himself, man seems invariably to fall in love with the newest gadget or gimmick that is merely an extension of his own body. Driving a car or watching television, we tend to forget that what we have to do with is simply a part of ourselves stuck out there. Thus disposed, we become servo-mechanisms of our contrivances, responding to them in the immediate, mechanical way that they demand of us. The point of the Narcissus myth is not that people are prone to fall in love with their own images but that people fall in love with extensions of themselves which they are convinced are not extensions of themselves.""<p><a href=""http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_2art6.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_...</a>",1361531821

b) resist the urge to show them a 'better' way. E.g.: In the HealthCare domain, I learnt people don't really want quicker or lesser clicks. They would prefer a set, stable workflow.

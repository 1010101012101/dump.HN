The company behind SciPy, Enthought, had revenue in the millions when I last worked with them three years ago and were doubling every year.<p>They are predominantly a service business, however, and provide custom software for a few very large clients (oil and gas industry, and one very large consumer products company).  They've moved slowly in the direction of products rather than services, but I don't think they've ever quite made the break from being a custom software shop for (very profitable) niche markets.<p>I explained their business as a way of saying that while you can build a profitable business and make yourself rich on the kind of tools you're talking about (the founders of Enthought are doing very well for themselves and could probably sell the company tomorrow and retire multi-millionaires; they're also doing fantastic things for their Open Source community at the same time), you can't raise money in the valley for that kind of company.  Until you figure out how to productize what you're doing, and make it possible to increase revenue faster than you increase head count, you aren't building a startup.  You might be building a business, and that might be awesome, but valley investors pretty much only invest in startups.",1240181634

Vista hasn't been a failure for MS, just not an obvious success. 'Failure' brings to mind things like OS/2.<p>For >20 years now, I've just been in the habit of preferring the odd-numbered versions, and assuming that the even-numbered versions were meant as incubators for the next major shift (most recently, from 32 to 64 bit computing).

569882,comment,569545,569703,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""it makes very little sense to take a product with the name recognition of Webmin back to an incubator""<p>We don't think so.  Webmin is an Open Source project.  Virtualmin, Inc. is a business.  The business is new, and had pretty low recognition when we accepted YC funding. We're still not as well known as a company as we are as an Open Source project, but we are finding more and more of our customers have never used or heard of Webmin.<p>""neither the money nor the YC mentoring seem a good fit for them; they could have gotten funding from RedHat, IBM, Oracle or whoever else.""<p>This makes assumptions about us and our company that aren't accurate.<p>We weren't looking for funding for our Open Source projects.  We've funded them just fine on our own for 11 years; Jamie and I have lived off of our Webmin-related projects for most of our professional careers.<p>Now we are building a product startup that has a shared codebase and a large number of shared objectives to our Open Source projects.  Building a business (a startup, and not a consulting business) is a very different process than building a successful Open Source project.  We wanted some help with the former.  YC provided it.<p>""i don't think the server automation tools like Webmin or cPanel see much love from hackers""<p>We'd rather you not group cPanel and Webmin together like that.  They aren't even in the same market.  Webmin is for system administrators, cPanel (and Virtualmin) is for hosting providers and their customers.  Webmin happens to have been used by hosting providers a lot over the years, but it's a general purpose administration tool in use by large and small companies and individuals all over the world.<p>I won't make claims about how hackers feel about Webmin, but I will mention that Webmin is downloaded more than 2 million times per year.  I can't think of who else would be downloading it from SourceForge.  It's a UNIX system administrators tool.  A very large percentage of UNIX system administrators are also hackers.<p>It also makes me a very sad panda to know that you think we do the things that cPanel does that makes hackers hate cPanel (and thus think those same hackers should dislike what we do).  We don't generate config files from templates...we parse them and edit them.  We respect comments, file order, and if we don't understand a directive (say, for an Apache module we don't know about) we won't break it.  We work the way the OS does, respecting file locations and defaults (like Debian's sites-enabled/sites-available, or the per-interface iptables stuff), and go to great lengths to do so (have a look at the hundreds of per-OS config files found in Webmin for an understanding of just how great those lengths are).  And, we provide copious documentation, over one thousand printed pages worth, for how things are working and how they map to the underlying system.  All of these things are dramatically different from cPanel, and are designed from the perspective of ""I want a tool that helps me do my job rather than forcing the world to revolve around it"".",1240180184

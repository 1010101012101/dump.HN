1011760,comment,1011266,1011266,0,0,scottdw2,,,"I can only speak from my own experience, so I don't know if this holds for everybody, but I think the guy misses a lot of important points.<p>When I was 13 I discovered programming, using QBASIC, on my old 286. This was in 1993, before the Y2K and .COM hoopla, and before anyone I knew had access to the internet, or even knew what the internet was.<p>Back then, if you went to the library by my house, they had about 2 books on programing, from 1982, that had nothing more exciting in them than ""this is how your draw a maze in   BASIC on your Apple II"". Every now and then you might be able to find an old issue of Compute, with some code samples in it. For the most part, however, there was a pretty large dearth of information about programming accessible to a 13  year old kid who didn't know any one who knew anything about programming.<p>The thing I did have, however, was a copy of nibbles.bas and access to the QBASIC help screens. The language was small enough that one kid could read through every item in the index, and figure out what the meant. There were a few things, like BLOAD and BSAVE that I couldn't understand because I didn't know what pointers were or how they connected to arrays. Other than that I was able to figure everything out by just reading through the help screens.<p>This, I believe, is what made BASIC suitable for use by kids. It wasn't complicated. There wasn't a vast class library. The ability to produce sound was limited to the PC speaker, and there certainly wasn't any 3D graphics. There wasn't a windowing system, or any kind of scheduler.<p>BASIC certainly didn't have huge libraries to import.<p>Everything was super simple.<p>That made it approachable. It was something a kid could explore by him self, understand, and appreciate.<p>When you are exploring computer programing, writing apps that play pong or let stick figures shoot at each other with laser guns, all the rules on the right way of doing things just get in the way. They keep you from having fun. All you really need is a few variables, SCREEN, CIRCLE, LINE, BEEP, COLOR, and GOTO.<p>You definitely don't need classes, fields, closures, while loops, or even proper indentation. That stuff doesn't add to your DISCOVERY of computing. Yes it makes you a better programmer, but with kids that shouldn't be the goal.<p>The goal should be to HOOK them on programming. Rules just get in the way. Python has way too many of them. A lot more than BASIC.<p>Python has to be taught. You have to teach people: use control structures, indent your code, model things with objects, import these things. That makes it great for, say, college freshman, or AP students. It's not really suited for kids though.<p>BASIC can be explored. Easily. You can hold the entirety of BASIC in your head, at once. Everything. You can't do that with python, or even lisp (because of all the libraries).<p>So I say, give kids basic, and let them roam free for a while.<p>Let them make laser games out of spaghetti.<p>I think sometimes its easy to forget how much fun it was to write crappy spaghetti code that did small amusing things. Think back to when you were a kid, before you were old enough to know better. That's probably what got you hooked. Its what got me hooked.<p>That means BASIC, or something like it. You have to let people be creative, and messy, long before you start throwing rules at them. You can teach kids structure, and recursion, and pointers, and all that stuff later.",1261554491

The average person actualizes maybe - <i>maybe</i> 3% of their potential. It's possible for almost anyone to reach high level domain mastery in at least 2-3 fields in their lifetime, and make a at least a couple profound contributions in those fields.

1011748,comment,1011373,1011669,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> ... because it's the only place on earth where everyone is college-level smart.<p>Not true - there's plenty of places where most of the people you'll meet are quite intelligent, and not everyone in college are college-level smart. If you go to Harvard, sure, it's all fairly smart people. The average state school? Not so much.<p>As for places with lots of smart people, it's <i>very</i> worth it to go get coffee at the Ritz Carlton sometimes. It's $10 for a pot of coffee that'll serve 2-3 people, so it's only like $5 to go if you go with a friend or the girlfriend, and it's good coffee. There'll be smart people there from out of town, often having a quick bite to eat alone while reading a newspaper. Contrary to popular belief, wealthy people tend to be very friendly and approachable if you're polite, complimentary, and interested in striking up a chat - I've met a fair few intelligent people while having coffee at a nice hotel or ex-pat bar or other place like that.<p>If you're willing to try to charm a little bit too, you can probably talk your way into the business class/first class lounges with decent success when you're flying, and people inside tend to be a smart, a bit bored, and quite receptive to having a conversation.<p>There's lots of places to meet smart people. University is good for some smart people, but not all. I enjoyed some of the business and technical classes I took, but absolutely went nuts with the ""general requirements"" and the rote busywork it entailed.<p>So there's lots of places to meet smart people besides university. And seriously, I'd recommend anyone who isn't comfortable in ""wealthy places"" to go have a pot of coffee at the Ritz Carlton. It's $10, cheaper than a mid-end restaurant lunch. Strike up a conversation with someone. Might change your life, but at the very least you get more comfortable in the environment.",1261553602

The Maoists were bent on communist doctrines and making great leaps.  The pragmatists were more into what already works.  The heads of the pragmatists were Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_xiaoping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_xiaoping</a><p>The famine as you mentioned was attributed in part to Mao's radical policies, and because so Mao stepped down while Liu Shaoqi took his chair for a few years.  While Liu was in power he played with capitalist policies similar to those in place today (this was the early 60s), Mao got paranoid and ousted him and Deng, and cultural revolution was launched in part to undo their popularity.  Liu died in house arrest.<p>After Mao died in the late 70s, Deng took over and finally switched to market economy.  The current line of leaders descended from his faction of pragmatists.  Maoism is pretty much dead in China, a new split in the party is between the populists and the princelings, much more similiar to the dichotomy of liberals and conservatives in the west.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generations_of_Chinese_leadership"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generations_of_Chinese_leadersh...</a>",1261552358

And it is all much cheaper than a real program.  So you get to discard a lot of wrong ideas quickly.<p>However coding up a test program and being able to run through cases quickly on a computer catches slightly different classes of mistakes.  You might not catch a logic error in your code, but you are more likely to figure out how an external API works.<p>I think that both skills are valuable, and both let you discard wrong ideas quickly.

320596,comment,320467,320467,0,0,jwilliams,,,"The main problem that will need to be overcome for this to get kind of traction - licensing that is generally pretty outdated or brain-dead.<p>Unless you have an enterprise license, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, etc - all tend to license on a per CPU or per Core basis...<p>It's really annoying. Because you'll have some whizzbang J2EE app that you want to run. However, instead of popping it onto your scalable IBM WebSphere cluster, you put in a dedicated WebSphere instance. I've seen it happen and done it myself many times.<p>Why? Because it's CPU licensed. And the cluster has 10 CPUs that you'll 20% utilise. But it's still licensed as 10 CPUs. So it's much cheaper to license for 2 dedicated CPUs and take the operational hit (and probably environmental hit).<p>Cloud computing is meant to be licensed like a utility - proprietary software is going to have to catch up. Hopefully they've got the licensing situation sewn up with this.",1222862092

320588,comment,319780,320463,0,0,petercooper,,,"<p><pre><code>  I also find this approach is often the kind of thing that
  leads people to assume they cannot do something; they think
  that only ""really smart"" people can possibly do some
  particular thing, and refuse to try as a result. Of course,
  it can also go the other way--because someone does
  something hard, they insist that they must be really smart,
  or else they couldn't have done it. This only reinforces
  the problem.

To be fair though, this isn't exactly a problem - it's ensured you've gotten a whole lot of lucrative work because there's not a whole lot of competition ;-) There are, possibly, contrasting areas I feel able to tackle that would initially intimidate you (as video compression intimidates me) - that's what makes specialization such a great thing.",1222860614

Interesting, Informative, Troll, etc. (perhaps the slashdot categories)<p>Instead of up/down, pick a category (or several)<p>I set the system to show me the most interesting, or most informative articles.

If not, then you may not want to release it to third parties, and they may not want to read it.</i><p>I was speaking of closed source parts.  Open-source has a reasonable enough review process already.  Although I don't want the code publicly available, I don't want to waste my life being paranoid.<p><i>Depending on what you're doing, it may be more costly (in time/money) to bring someone up to speed.</i><p>Very true.  Fortunately, I control the requirements, and I'm almost compulsive about simplicity.  I want to be able to keep the code small and be able to rewrite parts quickly.  I'm very much into quantity over quality (<a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001160.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001160.html</a>), so if it's useful, I'd be happy to start from scratch just to bring reviewers up with me.<p>That said, I want to be able to bring other developers up to speed on the project later, and it might be time well invested trying to make the project easier to get up to speed on.  That'd also reduce the dependency on particular people that are in some part of the world I'll likely never see.",1222860204

The code and design should be entirely understandable given a 1-page overview document.  I'm certainly not talking about cryptographic code as you mentioned.<p>I'd actually guess that's the case for most code written in the world.  Given certain business needs, the code should be reasonably understandable for someone who wants to understand.",1222859292
320576,comment,320520,320535,0,0,ggruschow,,,"<i>Finding people who are good at reviewing your code is very difficult.</i><p>I think this is generally true even without the emphasis on my particular code.  Most folks suck even more at reviewing than they do at coding.  And of course it's always hard to find really good developers.<p>I think there might be attractive qualities for a high quality developer to take on such a project though.. For instance:<p>Short off-time hours.. like someone in Seattle could review pretty interesting code after their stupid day of meetings that they got sucked into by being too good at their job.  Hell, they might be able to do it _in_ the meetings.<p>Pay... I'd happily pay well over good dev rates for a good reviewer (or set of reviewers).  People telling me how I'm dumb and how to improve is great.<p>Joy of working outside of Java / C# / C++ / VB / ASP.NET corporate code.<p>Freedom to rip stuff apart without fearing for one's job or worrying about office politics.  Some of us have a lot of pent up rage :)",1222859102

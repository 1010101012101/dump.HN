9610998,comment,9605733,9610372,0,0,krupan,,,"I definitely did <i>not</i> have an advanced type system helping me out.  This was a SystemVerilog testbench.  SystemVerilog has a type system akin to Java&#x27;s or C&#x27;s.  Actually it&#x27;s probably worse than either of those.  It&#x27;s a real Frankenstein&#x27;s monster of a language.<p>The general idea with SystemVerilog is you have a low-level model of the hardware made up of language primitives like wires and logic functions.  Then you wrap that in a few layers of testbench code. Each layer ups the abstraction level until at your top level you can write tests in terms of high level transactions (in this case it was a flash controller, so you could do simple commands like write, read, erase).  The layers all take care of converting those high-level transactions into (eventually at the bottom layer) wiggling the input wires of the hardware at just the right times.  It goes the other way too, monitoring the output wires of the hardware and converting those wiggles into high-level response transactions (such as, &quot;here&#x27;s the read data you requested&quot;).  The net result is you should be able to write succinct tests at a high-level of abstraction that exercise a lot of the hardware (wiggles a lot of the wires a lot of different ways).<p>There were actually two testbenches that shared some of this code and among them at least three different code paths from high-level to low-level and back again that gave me trouble.  If I had unit tests isolating each of those layers it would have been a lot easier to find which layer was dropping a byte of data here or adding extra padding there.<p>EDIT: I just noticed the &quot;small incremental changes&quot; part of your question.  That&#x27;s the other thing about not having unit tests.  I had to get the whole thing to compile and run before I could test any change, and that meant changing <i>every</i> layer to handle the variable sized data.  Part way through I did stop to write unit tests for the trickiest (lowest-level) layer.",1432731534

Code is disposable (maybe-leaning-to-yes), data is not, yes.<p>But not properly defining your data is a huge mistake. Torvalds has been noted to say: &quot;git actually has a simple design, with stable and reasonably well-documented data structures. In fact, I&#x27;m a huge proponent of designing your code around the data, rather than the other way around, and I think it&#x27;s one of the reasons git has been fairly successful […] I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important.&quot;<p>Well-documented data structures. Schema <i>is</i> data structure documentation.<p>Your Point example is good. A Point is not a Size, but an array of numbers could be interpreted as either, or as a Latitude/Longitude pair, or as anything else. How do we know, looking at an array of numbers, what it is meant to be?<p>But if we knew it was a Point (because the type expressed it as such), then we&#x27;d also get to assume we can do point-like things to it.<p>Of course, YAGNI would suggest not creating a Point and Size classes until you need to differentiate between multiple types of ordered pairs. That&#x27;s fine. If your system only ever handles point data, then it only ever handles point data and we state that up front, allowing us to assuming &quot;oh, an array of numbers? Must be a point&quot;.<p>But being able to handle different types of data <i>is</i> a feature, and if you prove you need it, then you need it. Write that Point and write that Size class.",1432731490

That way you&#x27;re not experiencing the classic but very real problem of people not knowing what they want until they&#x27;ve got it.<p>At my workplace, for instance, not once in the history of the company has anyone with an office <i>ever</i> given it up, under any circumstances, to move into a cubicle again. Likewise, someone with a cubicle next to a window has never, in my tenure at the company, moved to a cubicle not next to a window.<p>As for standing desks, I didn&#x27;t realize that people actively eschewed them. My impression is just that they&#x27;re impractical for a lot of people to actually obtain. If your workplace doesn&#x27;t provide them and won&#x27;t on request, your options get sort of limited. I have a coworker who made a makeshift standing desk but it&#x27;s not very ideal. I imagine a ton of people are in this situation.<p>Ok, but let&#x27;s suppose that, by some ingenious study, you&#x27;re able to determine that nobody prefers the open office, everybody prefers private offices (quite strongly), and yet productivity for the company is better with an open office. That&#x27;s pretty counter-intuitive, but the world is filled with counter-intuitive things. Does that mean that companies should all switch to open offices?<p>Should a company do something <i>just</i> because it can be shown to increase productivity? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily the case. For instance, it might be that the productivity gain is somewhat minimal and that over the years a number of great employees are lost (or not able to be hired) due to the office layout. So in that case the illusion of temporary increased productivity will lead to a long-term net decrease in productivity.",1432731325

Most of the startups, are consumer based companies, many of which,  have followed the American counterparts, and to gain market share, they are not worried about spending money like it is endless. Take an example of &quot;Lenskart&quot;, which will send an optician to your doorstep who will do eye-check for you @ Rs. 50 ( < $1 ). Not to mention, the sheer number of promotional and branding campaigns they have been running.<p>I believe not every company is like that, but the startup scene in India is more or less, a gaining-user-share game. In pessimistic future, where these startups would be relying on the last pennies of their funding, I am not sure if they would be able to sustain if they start pricing the things they sell at a price to make a profit, since the Indian consumer finds these offers, the major reason to use the app.<p>It would be good if the startups also tilt towards actually making products, like VWO, Browserstack and ours[1].

It can impose a process, where none existed before. Perhaps, this can be a quality check process. It can be user feedback process. It can be promotion of journalists process. A process can improve operations and the outcome.<p>2. It can automate a process. Even if process exists today, if it is not automated, it may not be enforced. We do not have measurement on how well the process is adhered to; who is using it and who is not; what the costs of not using the process are.<p>3. It can optimize a process.

In hindsight, I suppose this fact alone in the early 80s was a sign of privilege many never had.<p>There was a local arcade called Shadowfax, and my buddies and I would spend hours there on Friday or Saturday nights.  The place ran on tokens, not quarters.  And if you bought $10 worth, you&#x27;d get double the tokens -- 2 whole rolls.  So $20 would set us young dudes up for hours of fun.<p>The low lighting, the neon, the thumping bass from the cabinets themselves, and the ambient music.  It all set the mood.  I&#x27;m pretty certain there was even smoking allowed back then, well before the Clean Air Act stuff kicked in.<p>A row of quarters on the marquee marking one&#x27;s place in line for a chance to be the next winner or loser in the PvP game of choice.  The thrill of making that pattern work in Pacman, and the rage of your last man getting eaten a mere 3 dots away from getting to see the 3rd intermission.  The awesomeness of those vector graphics games (Star Wars, Tempest, Asteroids, etc.).  The odd combination of annoyance, envy, and admiration of that one dude who through raw skill could monopolize a favorite game of yours for hours at a stretch.  The token weasley kid who slyly showed you how to get free credits by using washers or jamming a flattened soda straw into the coin slot.  Or that asshole who unplugged the cabinet and erased your hard-earned initials from the #1 rank.<p>Such good times.<p>Sure, some of the above can be chalked up to the rose-colored tint of reminiscing about a long-lost youth -- I&#x27;m sure guys 20+ years my senior can similarly wax poetic about the pinball era.  But that time was so exciting for me, as it was for so many here I&#x27;m sure.  The atmosphere and culture was so unique and interesting, with a camaraderie that was unique at the time.  Video games were becoming big, and personal computing was just ramping up.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to enjoy that era at the age in which I did.  It had no small influence on who I am today.  And while my kids were playing and loving the old classics thanks to MAME at a very young age, they&#x27;ll never truly know the joy of the arcade.",1432730204

The difference is, at home you can spend your time with a book, cooking, with kids or spouse - which all is refreshing and in general will improve your performance once you get back to work.<p>In the office not working constitutes mostly of playing dumb games or reading hacker news, the latter being kind of ok, but certainly it doesn&#x27;t leave me refreshed and willing to go back to my not-so-hip-after-the-latest-js-framework code.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s realistically possible to put a metric on one&#x27;s performance, that would allow us to break from time-based evaluations completely. That being said, I see how my colleagues are progressing with their work and it has nothing to do with which are working from home, which from office and there is also no clear time-value correlation either. It has more to do with how motivated they are, what internally drives them and how skilled they are.<p>I have a friend at work who believes deeply in software craftsmanship principles and it&#x27;s a privilege to see how he works. He stays at home more than most of us, but provides a steady and consistent stream of small, high-quality pull requests, all day, every day. I watch how not slacking at work can have a great impact on the project and on the team morale. It has very little to do with an open space, WFH, what kind of laptop you work on and what blend of coffee you are given. I grew to believe those are just excuses I (and others) are giving themselves to not fully focus on work. Once I admitted that to myself, I decided to spend my slacking time in a way that improves my performance later. I hope one day it will go away completely, or I will get organized enough to be consistent in my output regardless of interruptions.",1432728186

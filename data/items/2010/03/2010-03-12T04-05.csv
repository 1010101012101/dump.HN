Ok, he operates on children, he gets a background check, so far so good. As one of only a few hundred dedicated paediatric surgeons, his skills are in demand, he is called as a consultant to another hospital. They don't accept any checks except their own so they do another. Which takes another month during which he is unable to help. Repeat for every hospital or every NHS zone, every year, for every applicable surgeon.<p>But who cares that treatment for children is being hindered by repetetive bureacracy, at least it's protecting children, right? Oh, wait...<p>In other words, having checks in place is a good thing, but only as far as it is proportionally useful to the costs of doing it. Not just doing anything and everything to anyone and everyone because it might help maybe.<p><i>I don't get the whole ""pshaw, it's rare, no worries"" attitude. I thought many of us here spend a lot of time eliminating rare events.</i><p>How much do you spend on rare event insurance?

1185817,comment,1185478,1185734,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"I've also been using Sleep Cycle since the first WakeMate delay and I've been thinking about this in some detail.  Here are the conclusions I've come to:<p>* WakeMate seems to be primarily competing on price (!) against FitBit and Zeo.  The problem is, Sleep Cycle <i>way</i> undercuts them.<p>* I would be willing to pay for dedicated hardware that would free up my iPhone for music listening before bed(like Zeo or FitBit).  Unfortunately, WakeMate doesn't help in this regard.<p>* There are times that I think Sleep Cycle is inaccurate, but I think it's ""good enough"" in a lot of sleep circumstances.  Dedicated hardware should improve over a bed accelerometer a bit, but I don't think the additional accuracy alone is worth $48<p>* I'm hoping WakeMate's statistics and analysis meet or exceed the Zeo, but to be honest Sleep Cycle's stats are ""good enough"" for a variety of circumstances.<p>I really do think they're in trouble, quite independent of the shipping delays.  Unless they can come up with some novel feature that nobody else can emulate, I can't really see how they can improve enough on Sleep Cycle to capture enough of the market.

Thus, nobody would be able to piggy back of the Sequoia investments.<p>Think about it, what does Sequoia really do? They do not really provide capital, because they use other people's capital. Their contribution or value is in selecting the investments. Presumably, they are so popular and rich and successful because they are very good at selecting profitable investments.<p>If you think about it in this way, it is no surprise at all that there is a herd mentality with VCs. It is actually kind of logical. If an investor merely follows the Sequoia investments, they will get the benefit of Sequoia's presumably excellent investment picking skills without having to pay Sequoia anything. For example, imagine if you are an investor that is well connected in SV and you simply sniff out deals where Sequoia is investing and put in 10c of your money for every dollar that Sequoia puts in. That is like being an investor of a Sequoia fund. But it is even better because the actual Sequoia investors would have to pay costs to finance the salaries of the very well paid Sequoia partners. You on the other hand get in for free.<p>So Sequoia is crazy to let other people in on what investments they are making.",1268369262

1185803,comment,1184495,1185597,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"<i>You claim Objectivism claims all rich people are productive and all poor people are parasites.</i><p>I do no such thing; I merely draw an analogy to the broad grouping of social classes in orthodox Marxism, which equally does not argue that 100% of Class A are good and 100% of Class B are bad.<p>Meanwhile, let us consider Rand's philosophy as expounded by Rand herself; for simplicity's sake, and because she considered it such a vitally important work, we'll look at Atlas Shrugged. We are meant to glean from it a view of Rand's purely-rational, logically-defensible Objectivist ethics, but what we find is merely contradiction piled upon contradiction.<p>Selfishness, Objectivism tells us, is a virtue. So how is it presented in Atlas Shrugged? Well, while the selfishness of, say, Galt is held up as great and good, the selfishness of people other than Rand's heroes is painted as a vast evil, such that their very lives are to be forfeit as punishment.<p>And though Objectivism preaches an ethics based on the sanctity of the individual's rights over him- or herself and that subverting the individual's goals for the ""greater good"" is an absolute evil, Atlas Shrugged preaches that individuals can and should be killed as needed in the service of greater advances. Say, to expose corruption in railway management.<p>I could go on if you'd like, since Objectivism as expressed by Rand in her books has more holes in it than a slice of Swiss cheese, but hopefully you'll trust that I've actually given this some thought. The final impression I came away with was that Rand was trying to write tales of Nietzsche's ubermensch (which would resolve contradictions by putting her heroes beyond mere everyday notions of good and evil), but merely produced a caricature of his philosophy embedded into a series of one-dimensional and frankly unreadable novels.",1268369155

1185800,comment,1184983,1185211,0,0,sliverstorm,,,"My personal belief is we fixate on things like plane bombings and child abductions because we are out of touch with the world in the given respect.<p>We understand there is a risk to driving a car, and accept it.  To some extent we are deadened to it, forget about it (which is why I occasionally <i>force</i> myself to remember the risks) but we also intuitively understand the risk is low.  You don't see an accident but every 6 months or a year, and most people are involved in them far less, yet we drive nearly every day.<p>Planes and abductions are different.  We don't fly every day; we don't have an understanding of just how many flights happen, so we don't realize how low the odds actually are- we fixate on the downed plane, and in our minds we see 1 out of 1- 100% failure.  Now, there are some exceptions like 9/11, where the risk is low but the cost is massive, possibly offsetting the low risk.  That, on the bright side, can be approached differently (perhaps give the pilots weaponized doorways, or completely seal the door during flight. Institute a policy of 'go ahead and kill your hostage, we aren't going to crash this plane into the Empire State' [it is crucial to make the hostage NOT the pilot].  It's cruel, but if you crash the plane everyone and more are dead anyway, and without trained guards on-board there's not even a ghost of a chance you can <i>fight</i> the hostage free.)<p>Abductions are the same way; we are not aware how many children travel around on a daily basis and as such do not realize the relative size of the odds.  This one also has an extra spice mixed in though- we are worried about somebody else, and we are not there.  I find, at least for me, it's much easier to accept risk for myself esp. when I am involved in the situation, than it is to accept risk to someone else, ESP. when I am not involved in the situation.",1268369063

Once you exhaust your livers supply of glycogen (within 24 hrs usually) you begin the metabolic changes to gear up to burn muscle for ketogenesis.

I make my calls over VOIP with Talkatone and use the Google Voice app for texting. I pay $25 a month.<p>It was really hard to get this set up. I had to literally fight with AT&T, cut my own SIM, manually enter APN settings. When I have to purchase a new AT&T SIM after traveling they tell me it's not possible, that I can't do it. I explain that it is and I can, tell them how to set it up on their end. Ridiculous.<p>They tell me the iPhone can't do prepaid (it can), that it isn't unlocked (it is), that it won't work if it's jailbroken (it's not) and that all of my data will magically disappear (it will if you don't configure up the APN settings). They will say anything to steer you from prepaid.<p>Overseas in Southeast Asia you just walk in to a corner store, pay $2 for a SIM, give him a few dollars to load it up and send a text to buy a data plan.

SO WHAT!<p>Seriously, the thing I love the most about our choice of career is that if you want to be good at it you will be learning for the rest of your life.<p>I wrote a system last year that processes 3.2 Billion queries a day at peaks of 45k/second and all under 4ms response time.  Very little of what I learned in high school about z80 assembly language had much to do with this project.  Most of it was exposure to all the things I've worked with for 30 years and some of it was stuff I learned six months ago.<p>The ""learned six months ago"" is the part to pay attention to.  If you enjoy the challenges placed in front of you and you enjoy learning this is one of the best businesses you can be in.  If you want to park yourself at a desk and do minimal work and/or new learning then try a different field.  There are plenty of fields you can master quickly and not have to learn much for the next 20 years.<p>When you start is not as important as your passion and dedication.  My father and I were talking the other day and he told me how he was so impressed with how smart I am (this coming from my dad who at 71 learned to write in Php lol).  I told him I'm actually pretty average, the difference is persistance.  I recently heard a claim that Albert Einstein said ""It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer..""  I'm not sure if he said it or not but it is exactly how I feel.  It's not about what year you started to program, it's about staying with problems longer and working them out and learning along the way.<p>Enjoy the ride.. I know I have and it's just barely started.. ;-)",1344253556

If your observation is acute enough to see through the opaque man to tell that it's ""his chest [that] goes down on the table"", then surely it's good enough to tell us in what way the child tries to resist.<p>What disturbs me is how ready people are to dismiss this as acceptable. Whether force is warranted or not, whether the minor did something or not, whether he resisted or not, the force is still clearly excessive. A submission hold would be sufficient. And I would expect that the policeman would know how to execute a submission hold.

I call your mobile from my mobile, we're each charged a minute per minute.<p>In a ""calling party pays"" scenario, the person who calls pays for both sides of the call.  You can tell when this is happening by whether there are different rates for calling landlines vs. mobile phones.<p>The important thing here is what this means for pre-paid services.<p>In a ""calling party pays"" situation, a mobile subscriber can continue to make money for the telco _just by leaving their phone turned on_, regardless of whether they can make outbound calls.   The inbound caller will still be giving money to the pre-paid caller's telco.<p>With ""both sides pay"", the telco of the pre-paid customer receives all revenue up-front; there's no subsequent money to be made because all charges come out of the credit balance of the pre-paid customer.   Between that, and revenue recognition rules, it makes sense to expire that credit every 1-2 months because there's no other way to get a revenue stream off that customer.",1344252654

Even though you state that for any person member of humans, there exists someone smarter than person, sometimes you slip into writing as if there is a linear ordering.<p>The geniuses and prodigies, sure if you project unto one dimension you can find a few people who dominate. Maybe you can find a few such dimensions. But there are vastly more dimensions where they would rank poorly than not. So instead of looking at it down the narrow lens of any one subject, it is best to focus on creating a uniquely useful combination of skills that you dominate on.<p>And then, why focus on  intelligence or comparisons or domination at all? Focusing on things like that can be detrimental. Treadmill wise and also, especially to creating. Ranging from ""I know I am super smart enough to do that so why bother?"" to ""I am not super smart so that is out of my league."" Better to focus on results and ideas. You want to do something? Try it or don't. Sometimes being confused can be useful. Creatively speaking.<p>And then take a step back. It is possible that as you say, the distribution is no longer normal at tail but the range on humans is still a tiny pinpoint. We got things that are vastly dumber than us and it is very certainly possible for an intelligence to dominate us in orders of magnitude.<p>Why focus on such small change?<p><i>I have thought long on this in trying to combat feelings of worthlessness compared to how very much less I have accomplished than my father did at my age.

806405,comment,806050,806050,0,0,Estragon,,,"This is interesting, and may have useful applications, but it's not a validation of quantum computing as it's usually conceived, in that it appears to be doing the computation with multiple photons, so it could be relying on different photons being in different states.  True quantum computing relies on the Copenhagen interpretation of the current framework for Quantum Mechanics: that the probability distributions it operates on are, in some sense, real, rather than merely reflections of our uncertainty regarding the system's state.  It assumes that by operating on a superposition of these probability distributions <i>within a single system</i>, multiple computations can be performed simultaneously.  In the system described, that apparent superposition in the probability distributions is potentially being ""faked"" by superposition in the concrete, individual states of the multiple photons involved in the computation.<p>But I'm biased.  I'm quite dubious about the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and I think quantum computation is a <i>reductio ad adsurdum</i> of its conclusions, which may one day be used in its experimental disproof.",1252147451

That is exactly what the project leader claims in the article linked, I don't think even they expect it to be human behaviour because that is limited to beings that are humans.<p>The problem with the approach is that a simulation, by definition is not the real thing and that it will always end up being an approximation.<p>Our most powerful computers could not simulate all the interactions between atoms in a 1x1x1 cm volume of solid matter, let alone all the matter in a chemical soup as complicated as the brain, and expect it to behave like one.<p>So, this is <i>also</i> an approximation, only a very detailed one in spite of the researchers claims.<p>They are still simulating neurons, one brain weighs about 1.5 Kg, it contains roughly on the order of 100 billion neurons, but it contains much more than <i>just</i> the neurons, and other cells in the brain could easily be crucial for its functioning.<p>For example there are the 'glial' cells, which at least double the number of cells in any simulation that wants to take on the whole brain, the glial cells are part and parcel of brains all brains that we've looked at have them, they may be only there in a supporting role or they may end up being crucial.<p>Recent studies suggest that these cells are not as simple and passive as we used to think and that they may have a more active role.<p>That doesn't say it can't be done, it simply says that to stick a deadline on it is unwise. You should not make bold claims without the evidence to back it up.<p>Essentially they are saying they are only 5 orders of magnitude away from simulating a brain in real time:<p>The currently achieved milestone stands at 100 million neurons with 100 billion synapses 100 times slower than real-time, and that is assuming that the simulation model is indeed accurate enough to eventually lead to emergent behaviour, which to date has not happened. (And that would be the biggest news since the moon landings in terms of human achievement).<p>Especially the growing up (which already starts in womb) is where the problems may be, we have absolutely no idea what it takes to bootstrap a brain.<p>There may be more to it than we know about, in fact there probably is.<p>Some theorists postulate the existence of firmware like code present in the DNA, there are many other even weirder theories, one of them may well be right. That would mean that we are simulating a bunch of hardware here, completely forgetting about the software required to run that hardware.<p>Thanks for the explanation on hypoxia, I did not realize that the damage was always irreversible, even when the period without oxygen is short.<p>Regarding the electro shock therapy, yes, that is true but it starts out assuming that the brains state is 'electrical', which it doesn't have to be at all.<p>It could be chemical, it could be based on standing waves in the neural tissue, there are a great many ways to store state.<p>For instance, one of the first computers that ever existed used standing waves in tubes filled with mercury to store its state.<p>So until we know what that state is and how it is stored we will not know how to reset it reliably, nor will we know if it is possible to restore such a state once it has been 'lost'.<p>'Grand mal attacks' or seizures seem to have something to do with feedback loops within the brain, cycles where the end result sets the whole thing off once again.<p>By necessity the brain has to contain many such potential loops and under normal conditions the feedback factor is kept in check, but with the right trigger pattern a series of self re-inforcing patterns can be established.<p>edit: have a look here: <a href=""http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dadgrp/research/poc/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dadgrp/research/poc/index.html</a><p>there is a lot of interesting information in there, even though it is already old (10 years), the numerical data is still accurate.",1252146726

806401,comment,805132,805193,0,0,messel,,,"It was less a projected charging plan and more a statement concerning the complicated nature of value. There's a contradiction in that no man's effort can be perfectly measured. Consider historic visionaries, a great many years after their life has ended, society finds great value in their creations and ideas. It's a tough thing for us to judge somethings price (we estimate what it's worth to us at least).<p>(My response to a comment from Dave)\nI admit there is a split between emotional and monetary value. Maybe we have to do more than just put a price tag on our time, we need to charge an amount that ""pays the bills"" or provides for a sustainable business but understand that the ultimate value of our service may not be tightly coupled to the fee we charge.",1252146121

Copyright means someone else isn't allowed to take your homework and hand it in with their name on it.<p>Then I'd talk about maybe an artist or musician and how they earn money to do what they do - ignoring the part about the record companies. Mention that it is the state that helps ensure, with copyright law, that the creators of works aren't ripped off, that the state protects them for a certain amount of time so they can get paid for what they do. Book writers is a good example for why a longer period of time is needed, people can spend years writing books, if someone can simply copy it then the author can possibly only sell one copy.<p>If they catch all that I'd progress on to how large corporations have perverted copyright so that they can get the most benefit from a creators work (but that creators may still make more than they would because of the companies marketing abilities) and then how copyright terms have increased and that has changed the whole deal stopping works entering the public domain [as early].",1252145605

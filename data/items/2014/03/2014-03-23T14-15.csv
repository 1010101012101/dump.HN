7453465,comment,7442764,7453091,1,0,graycat,,,"> I was referring to AIXI as the perfect mathematical AI.<p>I will have to Google AIXI.  A big point about \nbeing mathematical is that that is about the only\nsolid way we can evaluate candidate work before running\nsoftware and, say, something like a Turing test.<p>Some math is most of why we know, well before any\nsoftware is written, that (1) heap sort will run\nin n ln(n), (2) AVL trees find leaves in ln(n),\nand (3) our calculations for navigating a space \ncraft to the outer planets will work.  More \ngenerally, the math is &#x27;deductive&#x27; in a \nsevere and powerful sense and, thus, about the\nonly tool we have to know well in advance of, say,\nwriting a lot of software.<p>But math does not have &#x27;truth&#x27; and, instead,\nneeds hypotheses.  So, for hypotheses, for some\ndesign for some software for AI, we need some.\nEnough hypotheses are going to be a bit tough\nto find.  And math gives only some mathematical\nconclusions, and we will need to know that these\nare sufficient for AI; for that we will want, \nlikely need, a sufficiently clear definition\nof AI, that is, something better than just an\nempirical test such as a Turing test or \ndoing well on and IQ test.  Tough challenge.<p>Instead of such usage of math, about all we have\nin AI for a &#x27;methodology&#x27; is, (1) here I have\nsome intuitive ideas I like, (2) with a lot\nof money I can write the code and, maybe,\nget it to run, and (3) trust me, that program\ncan read a plane geometry book with all the\nproofs cut out and, then, fill in all the\nproofs or some such.  So, steps (1) and (2)\nare, in the opinion of anyone else, say, DARPA,\n&#x27;long shots&#x27;, and (3)\nwill be heavily in the eye of the beholder.\nThe challenges of (1), (2), and (3) already\nmake AI an unpromising direction.<p>> The main recent advancement in machine \nlearning is deep learning. \nIt&#x27;s advanced the state of the art \nin machine vision and speech recognition quite a bit.<p>AI has been talking about &#x27;deep knowledge&#x27; for a\nlong time.  That was, say, in a program that\ncould diagnose car problems, &#x27;knowledge&#x27; that\nthe engine connected to the transmission\nconnected to the drive shaft connected to the\ndifferential connected to the rear wheels or\nsome such and, then, be able to use this\n&#x27;knowledge&#x27; in &#x27;reasoning&#x27; to diagnose\nproblems.  E.g., a vibration could be\ncaused by worn U-joints.\nWhen I was in AI, when I worked\nin the field, there were plenty of people who\nsaw the importance of such &#x27;deep knowledge&#x27;\nbut had next to nothing on really how to\nmake it real.<p>For &#x27;deep learning&#x27;, the last I heard, that was\ntweaking the parameters &#x27;deep&#x27; in some big\n&#x27;neural network&#x27;, basically a case of nonlinear\ncurve fitting.  Somehow I just don&#x27;t accept\nthat such a &#x27;neural network&#x27; is nearly all that\nmakes a human brain work; that is, I&#x27;d expect\nto see some promising &#x27;organization&#x27; \nat a higher level than just the little\nelements for the nonlinear curve fitting.<p>E.g., for speech recognition, I believe an important\npart of how humans do it is to take what they\nheard, which is often quite noisy and by itself\njust not nearly enough, and\ncompare it with what they know about the\nsubject under discussion and, then, based\non that &#x27;background knowledge&#x27;, correct the\nnoisy parts of what they heard.  E.g., if\nthe subject is a cake recipe for a party\nfor six people, then it&#x27;s not &quot;a cup of salt&quot;\nbut maybe a cup or two or three of flour.\nIf the subject is the history of US\npresidents and war, then &quot;I&#x27;ll be j...&quot;\nmay be LBJ and &quot;sson&quot; maybe &quot;Nixon&quot;.  Here\nthe speech recognition is heavily\nfrom a base of &#x27;subject understanding&#x27;.\nAn issue will be, how the heck does the\nhuman brain sometimes make such\n&#x27;corrections&#x27; so darned fast.<p>For image recognition, the situation has\nto be in part similar but more so:  I doubt that\nwe have even a shot at image recognition\nwithout a &#x27;prior library&#x27; of &#x27;object\npossibilities&#x27;:  That is, if we are\nlooking at an image, say, from \nsatellite, of some woods and looking\nfor a Russian tank hidden there, \nthen we need to know what a Russian\ntank looks like so that we can guess\nwhat a hidden Russian tank would look\nlike on the image so that we can, then,\nlook for that on the image.  Here we\nhave to understand lighting, shadows,\nwhat a Russian tank looks like from\nvarious directions, etc.  So, we are\nusing some real &#x27;human knowledge&#x27;\nof the real thing, the tank, we\nare looking for.<p>E.g., my kitty cat has a food\ntray.  He knows well the difference\nbetween that tray and everything\nelse that might be around it --\njug of detergent, toaster, bottle\nof soda pop, decorative vase,\na kitchen timer.  Then I can move\nhis food tray, and he doesn&#x27;t get\nconfused at all.  Net, what he is\ndoing with image recognition is\nnot just simplistic and, instead,\nhas within it a &#x27;concept&#x27; of his\nfood tray, a concept that he \ncreated.  He&#x27;s not stupid you know!<p>So, I begin to conclude that for \nspeech and image recognition, e.g.,\nhandwriting recognition, we need\na large &#x27;base&#x27; of &#x27;prior human \nknowledge&#x27; about the &#x27;subject area&#x27;,\ne.g., with &#x27;concepts&#x27;, etc.,\nbefore we start.  That is, we need\nclose to &#x27;full, real AI&#x27; just to,\nsay, do well reading any handwriting.\nFrom such considerations, I believe\nwe have a very long way to go.<p>Broadly one of my first cut guesses about\nhow to proceed would be to roll back\nto something simpler in two respects.\nFirst, start with brains smaller, hopefully\nsimpler, than those of humans.\nMaybe start with a worm and work up to\na frog, bird, ..., in a few centuries, a\nkitty cat!  Second, start with the baby\nanimal and see how it learns once it\nstarts to as an egg, once it&#x27;s born,\nwhat it gets from its mother, etc.\nSo, eventually work up to software that\ncould start learning with just &quot;Ma ma&#x27;\nand proceed from there.  But can&#x27;t just\nstart with humans and &quot;Ma ma&quot; because\na human just born likely already has\nsomehow built in a lot that is crucial\nwe just don&#x27;t have a clue about.\nSo, start with worms, frogs, birds,\netc.<p>Another idea for how to proceed is to\ntry for just simple &#x27;cognition&#x27;\nwith just text and image input\nand just text output.  E.g., start\nwith something that can diagram\nEnglish sentences and move from there\nto some &#x27;understanding&#x27;, e.g., have \nmade progress enough with \n&#x27;meaning&#x27; that, e.g., know\nwhen two sentences with quite different\nwords and grammar really mean essentially\nthe same thing and when they don&#x27;t mean\nthe same thing report why not and be\nable to revise one of the sentences so that\nthe two do mean the same thing.\nSo, here we are essentially assuming\nthat AI has to stand on some capabilities\nwith language -- do kitty cats have\nan &#x27;internal language&#x27;?  Hmm ...!

I was always told that I had &quot;weak ankles&quot; by doctors as a teenager and I was never able to run more than 3-4 miles regularly without developing extreme shin splints and knee pain that would leave me barely able to walk and require several weeks, if not months, of recovery.<p>In 2010 I started wearing Vibram Five Fingers exclusively. In 2011, I started wearing Huaraches [1] which are even more minimalist than Vibram FFs (and a lot more natural--when I&#x27;m not barefoot, I wear huaraches), then in 2012 I went straight barefoot.<p>In September of 2012, I ran 17 miles non-stop [2], barefoot (all types of surfaces, including rain).

Incidentally, Amazon doesn&#x27;t let you go past the 400th page. An addition 5000 books listed at the minimum Kindle Store price of $0.99.<p>Poorly Photoshopped covers. Absurd titles, splitting into fractals of subtitles, &quot;series&quot; this, &quot;saga&quot; that.

Now read the reviews. Glowing expositions of &quot;couldn&#x27;t put it down until I finished it in one sitting&quot;. No shit! I should hope you could read 50 pages in one sitting.<p>In contrast, I packed up my poorly-maintained blog into a Word document and it was 150 pages for the last three years. With no change in my writing habits, I could be releasing a Kindle Book every year.<p>Now, swap the sort: go highest to lowest. THIRTEEN books listed at $200. That little bit of absurdity aside, the general fare isn&#x27;t much better than the bottom of the price list. A few notable exceptions, but on the whole, it&#x27;s clear people will probably prefer to take their chances on a $1 book that will probably suck than a $30 book that will probably suck. On the 400th page, all of the titles are $3.99.

The Subway is utilized by people from all backgrounds.<p>In SF, the buses are dirty and filled with homeless and mentally ill people.  Taking a bus home late at night is the plight of the commoners, the poorest class that work in the service industry and can&#x27;t afford an Uber or taxi.  And this class divide is why a BART strike is possible.  The worst affected were those who didn&#x27;t have a car too fall back on, or who couldn&#x27;t work from home for a few days.<p>If something so critical as the NYC Subway stops functioning for more than a few hours, the MTA provides alternative buses and advance notice.

The real problem is that all these services will, in the default configuration (no 2-factor auth), perform password resets via your email account. Thus if you succeed in hacking someone&#x27;s mail account you can take control of their other accounts and go ahead and verify a new keybase profile. Unfortunately there&#x27;s no way to know externally if someone uses 2-factor, so it&#x27;s hard to judge how meaningful a Keybase profile really is.<p>The mitigating factors here are:<p>1) Most &quot;good&quot; services at least those used by the tech geek community do support 2SV these days, which would raise the bar somewhat for people who use it, although I suspect several of those services will still unlock 2SV for you if you say you lost your second factor and know enough about the account (Google does).<p>2) Someone would obviously notice that their passwords had all been reset and could sound the alarm.<p>But in practice, I think this feels like not much different to just verifying ownership of an email address, which is what CA&#x27;s already do (and there are PGP CA&#x27;s if you don&#x27;t want to use X.509).

Regarding cleanness it depends on which neighbors you live in. If you live in Richmond or Outer Sunset like I was the neighborhoods should be pretty clean. Where I live now in NY is considered one of the safest neighborhood but with the ever increasing population the neighborhood is getting dirtier.<p><i>San Francisco shuts down at 10pm; New York truly is the city that never sleeps, and many neighborhoods feel busy and alive at all hours of the night.</i><p>True.

In the same vein as attacking Twitter for not making the follow relationship symmetric or attacking Instagram for ruining the dynamic range of pictures, this author is (mostly) attacking Keybase for the very point of what Keybase is.<p>PGP has failed to reach even a moderate userbase outside of crypto enthusiasts, and while part of this, as the author suggests, is painful UI, a large part is also that the web of trust model is unreasonably demanding for most cases.<p>Keybase asks: who are you on the internet if not the sum of your public identities? The fact that those identities all make a certain claim is a proof of trust. In fact, for someone who knows me only online, it&#x27;s likely the best kind of trust possible. If you meet me in person and I say &quot;I&#x27;m sgentle&quot;, that&#x27;s a weaker proof than if I post a comment from this account. Ratchet that up to include my Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, personal website and so forth, and you&#x27;re looking at a pretty solid claim.<p>And if you&#x27;re thinking &quot;but A Scary Adversary could compromise all those services and Keybase itself&quot;, consider that an adversary with that much power would also probably have the resources to compromise highly-connected nodes in the web of trust, compromise PKS servers, and falsify real-world identity documents.<p>I think absolutism in security is counterproductive. Keybase is definitionally less secure than, say, meeting in person <i>and</i> checking that the person has access to all the accounts you expect, which is itself less secure than all of the above <i>and</i> using several forms of biometric identification to rule out what is known as the Face/Off attack.<p>The fight isn&#x27;t &quot;people use Keybase&quot; vs &quot;people go to key-signing parties&quot;, the fight is &quot;people use Keybase&quot; vs &quot;fuck it crypto is too hard&quot;. Those who need the level of security provided by in-person key exchanges still have that option available to them. In fact, it would be nice to see PKS as one of the identity proof backends. But for practical purposes, anything that raises the crypto floor is going to do a lot more good than dickering with the ceiling.<p>And I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;don&#x27;t reinvent crypto&quot; argument at all. Sure, it&#x27;s a bad idea to use your own password hash instead of bcrypt, but maybe you think you can do better and you end up creating the foundation for Litecoin. A general-case argument against any innovation is a dangerous thing.<p>With that said, I totally agree about uploading your private key to Keybase. That&#x27;s one very scary basket to put all your eggs in and I don&#x27;t trust it at all. Luckily, it&#x27;s optional.",1395583939

Of course, that&#x27;s also the fault of the NIMBYs, who should be squashed with extreme prejudice. They deserve far more hatred than anyone on Sand Hill Road. It&#x27;d be better if the insane anger were directed at NIMBYs instead of innocent Google engineers (who are also getting ass-raped by rent, thus victims of the same thing).<p>I don&#x27;t know what the permanent identity of San Francisco is. I hope the crash will take out the nonsense and flush the entitled, Harvard-MBA culture back into the Stygian reaches from which it came. Let&#x27;s have the NIMBYs thrown under that bus as well. They&#x27;re certainly trying to turn San Francisco into a shitty New York knock-off, but they haven&#x27;t <i>irreversibly</i> won yet.",1395583867

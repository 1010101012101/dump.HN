3843314,comment,3842713,3843208,7,0,chris_wot,,,"For point 3, it might be worthwhile understanding what the ECMA standard says about automatic semi-colon insertion. It won't happen for the following:<p><pre><code>  a = b
  ++c
</code></pre>
This becomes:<p><pre><code>  a = b;
  ++c;
</code></pre>
and NOT:<p><pre><code>  a = b++;
  c;
</code></pre>
There are other, odd gotcha's, but this is the one being discussed.<p>I believe the issue with the bang (!) operator is that it's being considered as a binding de-reference of function objects. See here: <a href=""https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2010-July/011494.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2010-July/0114...</a><p>Therefore, the problem with the code would be that an automatic semi-colon would not be inserted and the code, which is currently:<p><pre><code>  clearMenus()
  !isActive && $parent.toggleClass('open')
</code></pre>
Would become:<p><pre><code>  clearMenus()!isActive && $parent.toggleClass('open');
</code></pre>
Instead of:<p><pre><code>  clearMenus();
  !isActive && $parent.toggleClass('open');
</code></pre>
That was my understanding, at any rate.",1334484700

More realistic: here are the things that need to be done for this business to survive; please do them.  Maybe some leeway in how you approach the problem.  If they wanted unbiased eyes, the job listing would have said <i>consultant</i>, not <i>junior developer</i>.<p>Believe me, I hear what you're saying.  I've tried it many times.  For instance: ""You don't check everything into source control?  Oh my god, it's so basic, look how much better you guys could be doing your jobs!""  Which, yeah, it would have been better.  It also annoyed the people around me and destabilized the team, even as it improved the technology.  Net loss for the company.<p>Having made this mistake over and over, I want to help others avoid it.  Junior developers, know that if you find success in your job, your most important contributions to the company will not have been code.  You will not bring some great insight to the table that makes everything faster/better/cheaper and wins you everyone's respect.  You earn respect and admiration by working hard (not smart, hard!) and helping the people around you.  Look up from your text editor, go talk to people, find out what they're doing, help them succeed.<p>That's where your focus should be as a junior.  (Or as a senior, for that matter.)

Nowadays we have the ability to create fancy renderings in something like Blender and add all sorts of effects with Photoshop.  Is that the sort of progress a ""Moore's Law for Software"" would be measuring?<p>One of the intrinsic problems with something like MLfS is that software ""progress"" is much harder to measure than transistor density.  What if image editors make great progress but text editors are stagnant for a decade?  What about search relevance improving steadily through the 1990s, then content farms cluttering results in the 2000s?",1339816031

4119732,comment,4117930,4119039,3,0,jcrites,,,"I approach all computer usage as if it's inherently harmful to my body, and I must minimize that harm if I expect to work with them the rest of my life. I have had excellent results avoiding repetitive strain from the following two products:<p>3M Ergo Mouse: <a href=""http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/ergonomics/home/products/ergonomicmouse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/ergonomics/home/...</a><p>Kinesis Keyboard: <a href=""http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/</a><p>I have no relationship, commercial or otherwise, with either vendor. Just worked well for me, as a professional software engineer. I highly recommend them. Both are designed to shift common movements away from smaller muscles toward larger muscles. Where a regular mouse relies on the small muscles of your wrist, the 3M mouse shifts that movement to the larger muscles of your arm. Kinesis moves the most common keys (space, enter, delete, modifiers) to one's (stronger) thumbs, and places keys to avoid the ""stretch"" of one's hand common with key combinations like ctrl+shift+T.<p>I should also mention that I use a standing desk. I think that's an important benefit to non-harmful mouse & keyboard posture. My experience from working while sitting in chairs is that your body tends to lean from side to side, extend one's arms to a degree that will cause repetitive strain, or put weight on the wrong places (like armrests). I have had an easier time adopting correct (least harmful, according to modern ergonomics research) posture while standing.<p>That posture is: let your arms fall limp to your sides. Now, bending at the elbow (and without moving your elbow), raise your arms in front of you to be parallel with the ground. That's where your keyboard should be. Your mouse should be in reach by rotating your arm, again without moving the elbow. This is the best posture for both chairs and standing (according to the ergonomics expert paid by my company to examine my working space -- I find this to be true in practice). As you can see, it is difficult to achieve this posture in a chair. The height of your desk is probably wrong, and you probably need a keyboard tray. It's more easily achieved with a standing setup.<p>I have had virtually no RSI issues since switching to these two products and a standing desk about 1.5 years ago. Both devices are fairly different from a normal input, and took a long time to learn to use effectively. The 3M mouse trades away accuracy, but with experience you can get almost as good as a normal mouse for regular desktop applications. I still use a regular mouse and keyboard for PC gaming, however.<p>Hope this is helpful to other intensive computer-users out there! Give standing a try -- your health will probably benefit.",1339815882

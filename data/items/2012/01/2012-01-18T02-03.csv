I was incredibly upset when I realized: a bunch of posts asking or answering meaningful on-topic questions had been blackholed, wasting a lot of my time, and (in my view) lowering the value of this site to everyone.<p>I never did figure out why I'd been hellbanned; my (polite and apologetic) emails were never answered.  I'd never been impolite, trolled, or called people names, and although I was a fairly new user, I'd built up karma quickly in that short period.

I'd hardly ever been downvoted, and even now, looking back, I have absolutely no idea what I might have done to warrant a hellban.<p>Hellbanning ""normal"" users is just cruel.  If your spambot/troll problems are so bad that you need to resort to hellbanning, it should be used rarely and sparingly.  But on HN, apparently, it's not.  If you browse with show dead on, I'd say 9 times out of 10 the hellbaned people you'll see should never have been hellbanned.

3477658,comment,3476016,3476859,3,0,cgh,,,"Here's the path I took:<p>1. Worked for around eight years as an employee at a few places, including a couple of startups. Ended up with a lot of Java experience.<p>2. Realised I wanted to restructure my life to work less (but still make good money) and travel/have fun.<p>3. Spoke to various people and found that contracting through a consulting company (not recruiters, but a team of like-minded programmers) was the way to go, rather than pounding the pavement to look for contracts. The company takes its cut, but I still end up with $80-$95/hr, and they find the work for me.<p>As for experience: Big Corp Inc. wants contractors who can get up to speed very quickly. You tend to get pigeonholed based on technology, so if you get the assignment as a ""J2EE guy"" and you don't have a lot of experience, then you look pretty dumb. Spend time working as a normal employee first and really become a good programmer.<p>As for work duration: generally, the contracts are open-ended and I am terminated when a project gets cancelled or whatever.<p>I specify up front that I will spend the bulk of my time working from home and that I am taking holidays from time x to time y. The company that subcontracts me out is based in Silicon Valley, as is Big Corp and friends, and I live in western Canada, so this isn't usually an issue. I fly down once in while to hang out.<p>So to sum up: get experience - learn to be a good programmer who has a reputation for getting things done; learn what big companies want in terms of technology; find a company with good connections who will contract you out, possibly as a team with other people; be up front about your lifestyle but work hard to integrate with their project schedules.<p>It also helps to not have kids.",1326855093

I'm trying to help teams of smart, well-intentioned people. Which is why I'm happy to share what's worked for me and encourage people to try those things if they're interested. That's what motivates the early Agile people I know.<p>But consultants are mostly in business to make money, and the bulk of their audience is clueless, so most of what gets sold as Agile today is tuned for them. I go into more detail on that here: <a href=""http://agilefocus.com/2011/02/21/agiles-second-chasm-and-how-we-fell-in/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agilefocus.com/2011/02/21/agiles-second-chasm-and-how...</a><p>> Also, experts will evolve a workable process for any given project without needing to follow any particular Agile process to start with. That's one of the reasons they're experts.<p>True, but that ignores the people who aren't experts yet. They're the ones I care most about. And it ignores the substantial costs of learning all the important lessons yourself; it's often better not to reinvent the wheel.<p>> [..] teams within a large organisation [...]<p>Personally, despite 10 years of looking, I have never seen teams within a large organization successfully adopt what I would consider a serious Agile approach. I have seen a lot of large organizations adopt Agile jargon and get nothing out of it, though.<p>The problem is that Agile methods require a shift in power relations from top-down to bottom-up. Their approaches and values are basically antithetical to a lot of American business culture and MBA dogma. And successful exploitation requires deep change on the business side as well.<p>I think Agile failed for the same reason that Lean Manufacturing failed here: the important part wasn't the easily observed rituals, but the cultural differences. And the vast majority of the people who are ""doing Agile"" (whatever that means) would not accept deep cultural change.",1326854959

For the list monad, choice is just the identity function. For the probability monad, choice picks a random element from the list. (Ideally choice would take a random access structure like a set as its argument, but I'm doing it the simplest way here.)<p>To implement shuffle, you more or less just transliterate the Python code as you'd expect.<p>Before you tackle this, make you sure completely understand how the same situation plays out for the simpler case of subsets:<p><pre><code>    subset        :: ChoiceMonad m => [a] -> m [a]

<i>As an industry executive with quite a bit of tenure I could certainly throw some additonal wood on this Manpower fire, however to be brutally honest, many of the issues raised within this string are common across many global staffing organizations. If the discussion is about trying to optimize on the model that built a 22 billion dollar company, then folks are wasting their time here, unless venting helps relieve some pent up angst. Unfortunately the real issue is the traditional branch based staffing model as practiced by the majors has probably reached the end of its lifecycle. Due to their market leadership positions, the corporate towers of companies like Manpower feel immune to the realities of the marketplace, an all to common arrogance that historically ends badly. They are big, bad, and think they have the power to manage the status quo into eternity, clinging to a push orientation which is breaking down in general. This is a fallacy any field person can recognize because they live market reality every day at street level. This business is commoditized. When you are big, profit is made and grown by volume, and operational efficiency (aka cost containment) first and foremost. Even the efforts to go up market in the skilled professions have been commodiitized, the only exception being where the laws of supply and demand heavily favor the supplier. In todays world profit is achieved at the cost of valuable high touch interaction with candidates and capital investment in the core business, ultimately sacrificing quality and driving employee dissatisfaction. This is an industry which measures success almost exclusively on the basis of size (volume or hours, which are becoming increasingly empty from a profit perspective). Besides being primitive, it is out of step with market reality which is telling all of us that for human capital its not size, but substance which matters today, for the customer, the candidate, and the delivery mode itself.<p>The entire way traditional staffing services are delivered needs to be re-invented and, given the stressers in the marketplace for talent, that re-engineered model probably has a substantial workforce skills development component associated with it. I expect this industry, which has experienced a measured amount of change relative to others, is headed for a period of susbstantial change soon, and when it happens, it will be fast.</i>",1326854746

4892821,comment,4887447,4890178,4,0,droithomme,,,"You reasonably ask, ""What's the big deal about an act of charity being 'selfless'?""<p>It comes from certain specific ancient theologies which adopt philosophical positions of endorsing anonymous giving.<p>In christian theology, for example, there is the principle ""do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing"". Back in those days some almsgivers would carry a bell and ring it as they gave out money to the poor, calling attention to themselves. It's possibly the bell ringing practice originated in wanting to let the poor know that alms were available, but christian texts clearly indicate that it had become a way of calling attention to oneself for their charity works. To this end, some persons donated in order to receive admiration from others, not out of compassion for the less fortunate. It was thus mentioned ""they have already received their reward"". This was contrasted to anonymous giving and a future reward in heaven as an alternative. But note still the person is doing it in expectation of receiving a reward, and not out of a sense of compassion.<p>Unfortunately, in the modern times, these principles are not normally brought up by others that share one's religion, but rather as a debate tactic to make others look bad and put down those who are trying to make a difference, regardless of any faith issues.<p>This principle is often brought up, as we see here, in order to pass judgment against those who give charity. Those who pass this judgment sit in self-righteous judgment of others rather than ""minding their own business"" as these judeo-christian writings also implore. Thus those making such pronouncements are picking and choosing that which makes them happy. The judgers judge because it makes them feel good about themselves, not because they are members of the same church as Larry Page (who is actually atheist, according to various sources) or others who are merely concerned with them having the right motivation in alignment with their communal belief system. The judgers have received their reward - a smug feeling of superiority over others who work to help the less fortunate.",1355003628

When learning any tooling, you spend more time in the documentation at the beginning and need to refer to it less and less as you gain experience. The next steps are specific to the field you are working in, whether it be LOB, embedded, distributed, data processing etc. For LOB apps I found it invaluable to review design patterns (because all tooling/frameworks use them) and object-oriented design principles. Development is more than just programming. Programming is the method of writing software and should become an asset in your arsenal, just like project management or problem solving skills. Unfortunately a lot of educational material doesn't go into the realm of proper architected software and instead just focuses on programming. Take a look at domain driven design (ddd), distributed domain driven design design (dddd), command-query responsibility segregation and different types of logical layering such as n-tier, client/server,semi-connected apps or onion layering too.<p>On a final note, write a lot of programs - even if they are only a couple of hundred lines of code.

So if your mental phonological loop can hold 10 fast syllables, you can hold the equivalent of 20 decimal digits in this system.<p>The system is logically arranged so it's pretty easy to memorize, and since it's base 100, the conversion to and from decimal is simple. The next step after is to memorize the addition and multiplication tables using them, which are of course much larger than in base 10. Once those become second nature, it should be possible to do mental arithmetic more quickly and with more mental registers to work with for larger numbers. I'm not nearly to that point yet, but it's a fun experiment.<p>If people are interested, I can toss what I have up on github and write up a detailed explanation of the system.

4892799,comment,4892592,4892736,2,0,cshesse,,,"The thermodynamics are straightforward.  The amount of calories you eat is a known quantity, the amount you expend is a function of a number of variables.<p>Perhaps something along the lines of:
   calories_in(food) => calories_out(activity_level, gender, age, weight, body_fat_percentage, protein, carbohydrates, fat, genetics)<p>I think the complicated part is altering your environment and/or yourself so that you, on average, don't eat more calories than you expend.  That is, to fix the feedback loop to make calories_in equal to calories_out at your desired weight.<p>It's not the simplest of problems, for instance, two people can do the exact same activities and eat the same amount of food and gain different amounts of weight.<p>Ideally, people would simply stop being hungry when they had eaten enough food, but if that was true, there would be far less fat people.  So what actually seems to be the problem is that the biological system that controls hunger is often miscalibrated.  I believe that diets attempt to fix that, to make people feel the 'correct' amount of hunger.<p>For instance, if sugar caused people to become hungry, or to  eat more calories than they otherwise would, or to burn less calories than they normally would, you could create a diet that contained no sugar.  The average person, if they followed the diet, would hopefully have a more appropriate hunger level at any given time.",1355003223

Tribalism and clannism seem insane to us -- but family and local ties are likely far more trustworthy than anything related to the government, law or ""Afghan society"".<p>Obviously that sets up a pretty bad loop.<p>I suspect that the most important economic flows in Afghanistan are foreign aid and narcotics.  The proceeds of the former are largely distributed via corruption, which requires co-operation, which is facilitated by the trust within tribal networks.  Those the latter would be distributed accordingly to tribal / clan structures.  I suspect ""the Taliban"" are basically a front for an extremely well organized drug cartel.<p>Notice that neither of these really depend on the productivity of the population.  So the powers-that-be don't need stability to keep the goods flowing.  If their economy depended on large industrial plant and skilled workers then blowing stuff up and killing people would be expensive and the society wouldn't tolerate it.  But who sits in office or who harvests the poppy hasn't much to do with the goods flow.  And so the gains on wrestling over the spoils are higher than those on increasing the society's overall production.  That means tribal co-operation ""pays"" a lot better than ""national"" co-operation.  And that co-operation is far more trustworthy.<p>Unfortunately this traps them in a loop where 1) the weak and just are screwed and 2) they cannot possibly build a real economy.<p>It's just a theory, but it does seem to explain a lot.  (And it's a vast oversimplification, just a very simple political / economic model to postulate how tribalism could be adaptive.  Even if that model is roughly accurate, the actual operation has to be vastly more complicated.)<p>(As an aside: People in the United States just have no idea what a miracle this place is, how carefully its society and government was constructed, and how easily that construction could be undermined.

I honestly don't know what you think needs changing.  I would recommend not reading the rest of this comment since it will likely have the same tone, and serves only to offer some academic frameworks designed to explain why we are having conflict.<p>-------academic communications issues---------<p>It is interesting that what I meant to say (thingA), what I actually said(thingB) and what jicksta2 voluntarily chose to infer(thingC) are at the very least two completely different things, related only by the pixels that jicksta2 saw on their screen.  It is unfortunate that they were not all identical.  The relationship between thingA, thingB, and thingC has been studied by many very famous academians, and is often lumped into a field known as ""communications"", more specifically ""linguistics.""   More specific to the issue at hand is ""semiotics"", which concerns the relationship between the ""signifier"" (pixels on a screen) and the signified (what I actually meant).<p>Obviously the relationship is very complicated and there is another issue about the relationship between what I said and what I meant(thingA & thingB), which opens up a bunch of epistemological, existential, and quite frankly solipsistic waffling that Dagmar :D Descartes famously reduced to 'cogito ergo sum', Latin for ""QED - Trust me, this proof proves it :D.""  Lojban and other engineered languages are attempts at alleviating some of these issues.

4892767,comment,4890631,4892597,1,0,lambda,,,"It is not illegal to have a website that's not accessible. It's illegal for the government to use or mandate software that's not accessible; and thus anyone who wants to sell to the government must make their software comply. But of course, in many cases this means that people either find some exemption or workaround, or do a cursory and not very useful job of making it accessible.<p>I am not arguing that you should ignore accessibility, or that it's not a good thing. What I'm saying is that there's a certain group of people in web standards who put accessibility over everything else, and refuse to adopt newer, better technologies for providing accessibility because some older, broken technology was already standardized on years ago.<p>For instance, there's the whole fight over longdesc in HTML5. longdesc has been standardized for a while, and lots of accessibility standards require or recommend it. It's supposed to contain a link to a page containing a textual description of the image; it is intended for cases in which you can't fit a full description into the ""alt"" attribute. But so many authors use it incorrectly; some just put the long description right in the longdesc attribute, some had broken links, and so on, that most screen reader users either ignored it or didn't even know it existed in the first place. One reason it's so badly broken is that normal user agents don't provide any way to access a longdesc attribute, so you never see that it's broken unless you try to use a screenreader and specifically test the longdesc.<p>So the HTML5 authors decided to deprecate longdesc in favor of newer solutions that were more likely to provide working description, like aria-describedby, which refers to another element on the page. That element is much more likely to work as it's already there on the page, visible to people using ordinary visual user agents, unless it's explicitly hidden. If you still want to provide a link to another page, you can just point aria-describedby at a link.<p>But many of the accessibility crowd complained loudly at deprecating the severely broken longdesc attribute, merely because it had already been included in so many accessibility guidelines like this, not because it was actually technically the best solution.",1355002322

Funding is in fact one of our biggest issue these days. We've discussed doing various fund raising efforts including Indiegogo but it does not solve the real needs.<p>The problem is that our expenses for that network are all recurring. We can get occasional injections of money for things like gear and generators, but it is hard to find someone who is willing to pay for the bandwidth or Afghan salaries on an ongoing basis.<p>All of us in SSF have no income from our work over there but we all continue to support our friends in Jalalabad in every way we can. For an indiegogo campaign to be successful it actually takes a fair amount of effort and is only a stop gap solution to the problem. So we are all focused on trying to sustain ourselves while actually solving problems. I can't speak for everyone in our crew but most of us don't have the time, energy or heart to do a full fund raising campaign that we know is only a temporary solution. What we really need is a sponsor to take over bandwidth costs and the salary of our fantastic Afghan crew who works on the ground over there.<p>So on the off chance anyone reads that and knows of someone who might be interested in becoming a sponsor, I can be reached at trevor.ellermann@gmail.com Feel free to direct any inquiries my way.<p>If there is any question of my identity and involvement in Synergy Strike Force, I have ways of authenticating I am who I say I am.

In Rust we've been experimenting with different mechanisms:<p>* Much of our code uses the Result<T,E> type for local error handling, which is very similar to the way Haskell handles exceptions with the Error monad.<p>* For long-distance, fatal error handling, Graydon was very influenced by the ""crash-only software"" paper [1]. There is a `fail` statement which brings down the task permanently with no chance of recovery. (The only code that executes after a `fail` expression is evaluated is the set of destructors attached to the data the task owns.) Of course, other tasks can continue executing and might restart the crashed task.<p>* For long-distance, nonfatal error handling there is a new condition system like Common Lisp's -- you register a handler and that handler gets called whenever an error happens. The handler could tell the function that signaled an error to restart with a new value, to return a value of the handler's choice, or to fail the task (the default in most cases).<p>The hope is that this is a more robust and performant model than the traditional exceptions model, while not being particularly verbose.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotos-ix/crash-only-software"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotos-ix/crash-only-softwa...</a>",1355000819

This kind of thinking is why, for example, Toyota was able to build the Prius and GM wasn't.<p>Japanese manufacturers started earlier, building up the necessary experience, technology, and culture at a time when nobody could sell hybrids without heavy subsidies.  They took losses for years, learned the hard lessons early, and kept the disasters small.  Then, when the market was finally ready, they were, too.<p>That's what Tesla is doing... but despite countless historical examples of market disruption, the incumbents will react with great surprise when they get their asses kicked.

It's not just the ""files"" though, it's\nalso the process, org-mode, org-agenda, and remember-mode (now org-capture) is fluid and stays out of my way while being\nhighly expressive. Because Emacs is <i>always open</i> and I'm practically <i>always using it</i> moving all of it into Emacs with\norg-mode has made my life much more streamlined when clipping/capturing the information I encounter throughout daily\nlife.<p>I have these different files:<p><pre><code>  - Prospectus\n  - Spark\n  - Grimoire\n  - Dreams\n  - Fashion\n  - Food\n  - Music\n  - Bookmarks\n  - Software\n  - Recreation\n  - calendars/parnell\n</code></pre>\n(I've got more files than that, but they are less relevant to this discussion than those listed)<p>I keep ALL of my org-mode files in my ownCloud directory (like DropBox but I own it) - which syncs with my ownCloud\nserver on Rackspace which backs up all the data daily.<p><i>Prospectus</i> is an org file that contains all of my project ideas. I use a remember-mode template for this so all I do\nis hit M-F1 select [p] and it pops up a template for the project idea prompting me for the name, keywords, and\ndescription - it also auto-fills the date and time I created it. I then type C-c C-c and it's automatically saved into\n<i>prospectus.org</i>. Any project idea is captured here, electronics, carpentry, startups, opensource, whatever.<p><i>Spark</i> is an org file for capturing pithy sayings, great comments on Reddit/Hacker News that I like, blocks of text\nthat are important or memorable from anywhere (books, email, web, etc...). I capture conversations, inspirational stuff,\nanything that I've discovered from <i>other people</i>. I have a remember-mode template for this one too.<p><i>Grimoire</i> is like my personal recipe/potion book - I use it to capture a unique and interesting process I've figured out;\nnovel solutions to anything from cutting an X leg for my desk to software. Meditation and life-process; my own personal\nanecdotes; relationships; psychology; pretty much anything that I've discovered, experienced, or figured out <i>on my\nown</i>. This is NOT a journal though, it's restricted to process, knowledge, and observations. I have a remember-mode\ntemplate for this one too.<p><i>Dreams</i> when I remember my dreams I capture them in there with remember-mode.<p><i>Fashion</i> any interesting styles I find on the internet, clothing/apparel makers I find, shoe makers, tips, etc... This\nhas its own remember-mode template.<p><i>Food</i> recipes (my own and others) and restaurants. Remember-mode template.<p><i>Music</i> any artists/tracks I find that I like.<p><i>Bookmarks</i> any websites that are interesting to me with description as to WHY it is interesting to me and a set of\nkeywords.

Paying attention to them matters because the exchanges and what happens there matters.<p>A casino is a place you go to lose money. It's all games and the odds are stacked against you. Everything we do in life is a gamble. An exchange is a place for people to make informed decisions about the prices of goods and financial instruments. Everyone loses and wins some.<p>I do relate to the long-term investing/capital building. The central banks keep printing money which funnels into the bond and stock markets. This in turn signals an abundance of actual economic capital, which there isn't. With the communication that there is plenty of excess capital for the long term, we (and especially people dealing in finance) act as if it is the case and start consuming capital. Eventually, facts catch up and we get some sort of terrible economic downturn. As a result of the long-term economic irregularity, actors act for the short-term because the long term is just too undependable.",1368137714

They're unattractive and small, but I've seen <i>a lot</i> worse.<p>Some of the places that I've had realtors show me make these places look like palaces. When I first got here and was living on close to nothing, I found (on Craigslist) a Williamsburg loft where there'd literally be a shower curtain separating my ""room"" (which was filthy) from a dark, tenement-like space with ~12 people in it. Kitchen stuff was at least 50 years old and probably didn't work. I visited at 10:00pm on a Thursday and it was loud as hell. $1200 per month. Um, no thanks. (By the way, Williamsburg has the most intense negative energy on earth. Hipsters sound okay in theory but I can't fucking stand them in practice. To give one a job is like pouring salt on a slug, except a good thing in the former case because the whining is entertaining.)<p>However, I agree with you. If you can get a stream of good jobs out in the Midwest, that is the way to go.<p>It's honestly not worth the cost of living here for most people. The high rents here are driven by (a) asshole foreign speculators that the government irresponsibly lets into the market, when a 6-months-and-1-day rule is really in order, (b) various legacy rent-control systems that wouldn't be a big deal except in the context of extreme price inelasticity-- I have no problem with the idea of rent control, or even with its continuation for the legitimate beneficiaries; but when upper-middle-class well-connected asswipes buy their way into an arrangement that's superior to ownership, and lock up housing stock, that's wrong, (c) NIMBY like you wouldn't believe, (d) parentally-funded hipster zeros whose guilt-ridden spawners decided they have some entitlement to the ""New York Experience"" (at $2-6k/month) even though they do absolutely nothing for anyone, (e) the fact that in investment banking and large-firm law, there really are major career benefits to living here (you pretty much need to live in Manhattan to get promoted in soft-side banking; trading is more of a meritocracy where you can live whereever you want as long as you show up on time). If none of these apply, New York is not worth the cost of living here. It is nice, if you take out the cost problem; I just think having savings and, eventually, the freedom with having a nest egg, improves the average person's quality of life by more. (You might guess that I don't intend to be here in 10 years, although I'm very glad I spent the 7 that I have.)",1368137449

And that gets into the ""would Jobs have been as successful if he had never founded Apple?"" thing, which is naval gazing.<p>But it's less of a shot in the dark to speculate that Thiel probably couldn't have successfully co-founded PayPal (a financial services company), without a college degree and Wall Street background. You can look at many entrepreneurs and say that they could've still founded their company if someone had given them $100k cash at age 18.

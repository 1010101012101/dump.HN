You could say that this multiplication would be 'void' (as in 'not assigned to anything') and I could come up with even more complicated example, like ""A * B();"" where this is either function declaration or multiplication of A and function named B() with side-effect let's say. But that's not the point: if parser has to do heuristics like that to parse language properly, it is already context-dependent or at least not LALR(0) or LALR(1).",1304348312

That means we keep about half of the ordinary income the Gotham Gal and I generate."" The second sentence glides over the key word in the first sentence, ""marginal"". AVC and GG pay much lower rates on the first income they earn during the year -- it is only the income that exceeds what most people will ever earn during a year that is taxed at the higher income rate. Conversely, the first income -- the income they have in common with ordinary people -- is subject to social security and unemployment tax -- but the extraordinary income that makes them very wealthy is not. They also probably pay much less of their income in sales tax and small fees that most Americans.<p>Finally, according to the IRS in several recent years 10% of the capital gains income in the entire country has gone to the richest 400 tax payers, whose average tax rate is not the 47% rate AVC cites, but 17%: <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/who-benefits-from-bubbles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/who-benefits-fro...</a><p>Edit: here's total tax distribution by quintile: <a href=""http://curiouscapitalist.blogs.time.com/2009/01/07/moving-from-judd-greggs-dubious-tax-math-to-robert-reichs-dubious-tax-language/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curiouscapitalist.blogs.time.com/2009/01/07/moving-fr...</a> .

2506451,comment,2505875,2506371,3,0,_delirium,,,"> The first is that capital gains taxes tend to be on investments made with income you've earned, so there's already been an income tax.<p>I don't really get this counterpoint; isn't <i>everything</i> in the economy a flow of money that has been taxed at a previous point in the flow? If I have $100,000 that I've already paid taxes on, I could invest it in external assets and hope to make capital gains on them; or I could plow it back into my own occupation and use it to generate income (say, by setting up an art studio). Why should I pay more taxes in the second case?<p>Consider two eBay-painting-seller scenarios. In the first, I buy painting materials, paint paintings, and then sell them on eBay. In the second, I buy existing paintings on eBay that I think are underpriced, and then resell them later for a profit. Why should I pay <i>more</i> taxes in the first case, just because I painted the paintings? In both cases my occupation is basically ""selling paintings on eBay"", but in one I'm creating new ones and selling them for an income, and in the other I'm flipping existing paintings, making a capital gain. In both cases the starting capital is money I've already paid taxes on. If anything, the first occupation seems like the one policy should encourage, rather than the second, but at the very least I don't see any reason to actively encourage the second version over the first.",1304348034
2506450,comment,2505882,2506055,1,0,jrockway,,,"Wait, I spend 99% of my time programming in dynamic languages, and I still use dependency injection.  Why would I want to resort to hacks when I can just pass stuff in to my classes instead?<p>I will admit that I need the hacks from time to time, though.  Recently, I wrote an overly large method that calls a callback when the command completes.  For my test, I needed to run a bit of code right before the callback was called.<p>Runtime role application to the rescue!  In my test, I wrote:<p><pre><code>    my $done = AnyEvent->condvar;\n    $done->begin;\n    my $called_callback = 0;\n\n    { pacakge FixupCallback;\n      requires 'update_table';\n      around 'update_table' => sub {\n          my ($orig, $self, @args) = @_;\n          my $cb = pop @args;\n\n          # this is like ""super""\n          $self->$orig( @args, sub {\n              $called_callback = 1;\n              $cb->(@_);  # call the original callback\n              $done->end; # then return control flow back to us\n          });\n      };\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThen, I just find the instance of the class that I need to tweak:<p><pre><code>   my $view = $app->latency_publisher->view;\n   FixupCallback->meta->apply($view);\n</code></pre>\nAnd now I've fixed up the code enough to write a sane test.  While cool, this doesn't negate the need for dependency injection.  I want my app code to be 99% clean, and use the hacks for that 1% case where the hacks result in cleaner code than ""the right way"".<p>Also, I've never programmed Java or C#, so don't say that I have inherited bad habits from those languages :)",1304348030

2506425,comment,2506074,2506363,11,0,jerf,,,"I think people may be overselling this a bit. It is true that antimatter bears certain resemblances to matter traveling ""backwards in time"" when the math is examined, but the mental images conjured up by a plain-English reading of that phrase are almost entirely wrong. It's not like you tap the antimatter and the motion goes backward in time. I hate using metaphors, but it's somewhat more like you have a guy walking forward on the road, but if you hit him violently enough he'll end up turned around, walking back-first but in the same direction. Yeah, he's walking <i>backwards through time! ime! ime! ime!</i> but it's not like you can actually send messages backwards or anything; give him a message and he's still walking in the positive-time direction. There's a lot of cancellation of the negative term that goes on and he's still dancing to the tune of the same arrow-of-time as the rest of us.<p>I'm pretty pessimistic that antimatter will be repulsed by gravity, because you would suddenly have a term that would have to appear for the potential energy of the now-flipped gravity field. It makes much more sense for it to be affected normally. It's an interesting question that we might as well look at, on the off chance that the science will be wrong (which is when it advances, after all), but I wouldn't hold your breath.",1304347715

Code that interacts against the database. Do you, or don't you, stub/mock out the data layer code? Traditionally people did mock this out. Then Rails came along with ActiveRecord...and now hitting the DB isn't only common, I think a lot of people agree that, at a point, it's the right approach. Because, after all, what are you really testing if you don't hit an actual DB?<p>But, that's specific to code that has dependencies on outside systems (like the DB, or your graphic subsystem). When I look at your Foo class and the IsValid method, I see a pretty specific unit that really can and should be tested separately from an actual GrSubsys implementation. I mean, <i>you've</i> given it a dependency on GrSubsys, but I'm not sure that's right.<p>Should the test read:<p>""it is invalid when the model is null""<p>or<p>""it is invalid when the graphic subsystem returned null""<p>?<p>The difference is subtle, but important. The first is decoupled from the implementation. Foo is invalid when it's model is null. The second is coupled to the depedency: Foo is only invalid when the graphic subsytem returned null.<p>What value does that extra coupling, within your test, get you? What should IsValid (either the test, or the implementation) care that why the model is null? Why add that extra complexity which makes your test more likely to break due to changes to the implementation of the dependency?<p>If you test Foo independently, and then you test that gGrSubsys returns null on an invalid model separately, the two unit tests end up working together in isolation from changes you might make to the other.",1304347235

There, i’ve said it.  I used to use singletons all the time  because they make doing some things, like sharing state globally, incredibly convenient.  My code was littered with XYZManager classes.  The defining trait of these classes was the static GetInstance() method that magically enabled me to get access to that object and its state wherever I wanted!!  What a great idea, right?<p>What a mess!  I learned over time that the cost of changing one of these things, or the cost of doing a major refactor was really high in terms of code change.  And to make things worse, because my classes’ dependencies were hidden in implementation and weren’t transparent in the interfaces it was impossible to write real unit tests.  This made doing a big refactor even less attractive.<p>So over the years, through work in the industry and coding on my own I’ve come to the conclusion that the singleton sucks, and that there are very few places where they are actually appropriate (logging comes to mind as one acceptable place).  The fact of the matter is that most of the places I see singletons used in software they are actually just an enable for developer laziness.<p>So here is my off the cuff list of why singletons suck.  Feel free to comment and add your own reasons (or counterpoints)<p>Singletons hide your dependencies.  This makes code harder to understand\nSingletons make unit testing difficult.  It’s hard to mock out a global object that you can’t inject into a class\nSingletons reduce reusability.  If i’m writing a class that utilizes a singleton because my application will only ever use one then i’m limiting myself because I can’t use that library to write test tools that may want to simulate how many of these object (for instance, many users) interact with a system.\nSingletons reduce scalability.  A single, global object?  Sounds like a source of contention to me.\nSingletons are not good object oriented design, they are lazy!",1304345105

(And it does happen over here in Australia).<p>Otherwise what you get is that companies, in shareholder's interest, try not to give out so much dividends because they will be taxed twice.

I will admit I haven't tried for a while, but every time I've tried out the Scala eclipse plugin it's been incredibly flaky.  For the top tier of developers this doesn't matter too much (they can either handle flakiness or do without an IDE at all) but companies specifically do not want to build their systems dependent on constantly having top tier developers to do every little change they need.<p>You can contrast with Groovy which while still not perfect, has an awesome eclipse plugin and SpringSource offers a whole customised eclipse version for working with their stuff.",1345679945

Just like email, I can filter out any messages from people not in my contacts. I may choose not to and instead run each one of those messages through a spam filter. In this respect it really seems no different than email. Individual clients/servers can choose to be as strict as they like (but servers are servers, and they are sitting on the internet, so spammers can see them and send messages that will be ignored if they like).<p>2. Since connections with most of your contacts are theoretically maintained so you can push out new data, updating is more akin to propagating a new ip through the DNS system than using a redirect. Yes a DNS server can misbehave, but that can only screw up a network of well behaved servers for so long.",1345679100

And congrats to everyone running a revenue-generating startup at YC if this is enough of a trend that Bloomberg is reporting on it!<p>I really hope that this signals the advent of a genuine change in how mainstream investors value revenue-generating startups, so that early-stage companies can get away from being valued simply in terms of a revenue multiplier and thus penalized in comparison to companies that ignore fundamentals. Among other things, this is going to make it much easier for bootstrappers, who need to build revenue into their products from the start.<p>And Paul -- if this is a real trend I hope you will follow up on this topic with an article in a couple of months. While I know this stuff is sensitive on a company-by-company level, it'll be interesting to hear how and if you perceive valuations are changing for YC companies that put their revenue front-and-center like this.

That said, I'm going to go out on a limb and say it won't take off, for all the same reasons this blog post says it will.<p>The product itself appears to be essentially a 'simple' algorithm for Facebook, letting you avoid the pseudo-intelligent EdgeRank algorithm they use and letting you see an unfiltered stream of a specific subset of the content. If it really is that simple, the key questions are whether users will go to a third party to get it and if Facebook will refrain from copying it in-house. Call me skeptical. Taking the points in turn:<p>1. User Aquisition<p>> For Hipset, user acquisition is very obviously built into the products and teams DNA. A well executed PR exercise this weekend generated a ton of interest from early adopters - who all signed up via Facebook auth. Meanwhile, the product aggressively (thats a complement) integrates with Facebooks Open Graph. Every time i engage with content on Hipset, it gets posted to Facebook. So all those early adopters using the product are actually busy sending notifications to their impressionable friends on Facebook about this cool new service. [...]<p>To paraphrase the blog, Hipset is better at 'growth hacking' than the blogger's product OneRiot was. It can go viral, and ... and what? It's positioned here as a feature for Facebook, so presumably a set fraction of the users would desire it off the bat. Getting in front of them is a recipe for an initial userbase, but there needs to be something beyond that. What's the long-term growth strategy, continue to hope Facebook doesn't provide a native view for this feed and growing alongside them? I don't buy it.<p>2. Users want it.<p>Again paraphrasing, the blog suggests that users want an undiluted feed. One benefit of this is that bands can directly email users who have subscribed. Except...what happens when a few are too chatty? Either they back down from that 'undiluted' idea, becoming simply a different algorithm, or users need to do all that micromanaging Facebook hides away, and get fatigued. There probably is a market for some who want control over everything themselves, but I'm not sure it's on Facebook in the first place.<p>The author also suggests that this is a perfect market for Mobile - where Hipset isn't yet trying to be. That's a significant pivot, although a reasonable one.<p>3 - Facebook doesn't need to copy Hipset, because it's complementary.<p>Facebook probably doesn't <i>need</i> to copy Hipset, no. But they have a vested interest in keeping everyone going to facebook.com, and not splintered into a set of micro-communities. Which means banking on their disinterest in the long run doesn't seem like a safe bet - and if Facebook decides to provide even half the features of Hipset, momentum and the hidden costs of each additional service will do the rest.<p>Now, there may well be a lot more to Hipset than this blog post is making apparent. I don't know. But there is nothing here to convince me that it's going anywhere, aside from a blip as the internet goes ""oh, that's cool!""",1345676799

We're talking about doing the right thing (TM), not the easiest.<p>I see what you're saying, I don't think that line of reasoning has to be true.<p>You're saying that if I choose to fill my gas tank instead of my weekly $40, I'll drive more and more and more. Not true. By filling my tank today, I'll still drive the same amount as normal, I just won't need to visit the gas station as often as usual.<p>Often when I'm cooking dinner, I'll say something like ""I don't need a lot, I had a huge lunch"" etc. The opposite works well too. i.e. ""It's only 11am and I'm starving, because I had a tiny breakfast.""<p>Limiting how many calories you eat by throwing out the ""extras"" is like limiting how far you drive by pumping ""extra"" gas onto the ground.",1345676591

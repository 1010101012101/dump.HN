10410687,comment,10410329,10410595,0,0,dTal,,,"I came to this thread to argue exactly this - pleased you did it for me! My issue is 1) They do not acknowledge the need for this &quot;initial minimal abstraction&quot; and 2) I&#x27;m not so sure that it would be so minimal.<p>The issue comes when you try to define &quot;safe multiplexing&quot;. Take for instance a spinning disk drive. If we took this at face value, every application would know about things like sectors and seek times. Presumably this would permit some sort of domain-specific optimisation (that, say, a database engine might use). Perhaps we posit that programs that don&#x27;t need such specialisation use a library for disk access. So far so good.<p>Now what is it the OS is trying to multiplex? No longer abstract, high-level concepts like &quot;write this data to this file&quot;, which it can safely mess about with because it knows what they mean; no, it has to multiplex read head seeks. It cannot have any awareness of the meaning of these seeks (that was the point of the exercise!) so it can&#x27;t really be more intelligent than a &quot;dumb multiplexer&quot;. So your finely tuned database application has its clever read head optimizations all shot to hell whenever literally anything else touches the disk.<p>In order for an OS to multiplex hardware resources efficiently, it needs to have some idea of what the applications are trying to accomplish, so it stands the best chance of giving it to them.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I also find the paper rather hot headed and light on concrete examples.",1445219797

I&#x27;ll stick to the addressing the content of what you wrote.<p>The difference in our viewpoints seems to be that you have an  &quot;adversarial&quot; understanding of the political system, where different interest groups try to get the best for themselves.  On the other hand, I think that politics is mostly driven by ideology, not self-interest.  If I can state an ideal set of laws, that should be sufficient and I don&#x27;t need to concern myself with how special interest groups might <i>try</i> to manipulate the set of laws.<p>I also think you conflate self-interest with what is right/wrong when you say &quot; If enough people like strong worker protection laws, well, that&#x27;s democracy, why shouldn&#x27;t that stuff get encoded into law?&quot;.  Do they like it because they think it&#x27;s right, or because it&#x27;s good for them?  That&#x27;s an important difference.<p>On the specifics, I mostly believe in the free market.  I don&#x27;t consider the free market to be anti-worker (redistribution through taxation/welfare handles that aspect) or arbitrary.  Classical economics shows that the free market should be considered the default position.  I also support limited rights for unions, e.g. I don&#x27;t think an employer should be able to fire you for joining a union, because the employers control of how people communicate in the workplace could be considered an unfair advantage.<p>Re violence, do you disagree that union members do sometimes commit violence against so-called scabs, when they attempt to enter a worksite?

Java/tomcat got their own proxy module (mod_jk), and after a while, as more (hw) resources became available, it started to make more sense for everyone to follow the good practice of breaking up services by user (either actual (human) user, or at least service user, like &quot;php&quot; or &quot;cgi-bin&quot; etc). And it became more common to use mod_proxy to forward requests to backends (like php-fpm).<p>For those new to Apache, it&#x27;s still easy to miss that Apache can <i>also</i> work as a full http proxy -- and it&#x27;s easier than it probably should be to set up an open http proxy without intending to.

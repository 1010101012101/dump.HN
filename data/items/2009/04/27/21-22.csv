Any pointers to best practices?<p>We do standard things like: always use SSL, hashed passwords, daily backups, proper privacy policy and TOS, software firewall, testing for SQL injection, using a reputable data-center.  We will be adding data scrubbing, hot backups, and XSS protection.  But what am I missing?  What is critical and what is optional?<p>Ideally I would like a comprehensive checklist, of the type that would satisfy a multinational client in the hi-tech industry.  The data includes names, email addresses, and physical home and work addresses.

Windows always satisfied my needs, however now that PC gaming has essentially become pointlessly costly to me (Microsoft lost me with the whole DX10 <i>only</i> games, now they're readying to release D3D11, likely with its own swathe of D3D11 <i>only</i> games), because I can no longer buy a top of the line card and run it into the ground, because of Microsofts foolish bid to force people into Vista.<p>Unfortunately I ended up with Vista on one of my computers, the system is so cumbersome it's repugnant to me. XP had it's faults, however they're all passable and the lack of elegance in the system was forgiven by its durability and compatibility between locals (School, Work, Home).<p>Unfortunately for Microsoft, my next desktop is going to be an iMac. I'm fully aware there's going to be a learning curve when switching OS, however using Vista is frequently painful compared to XP. So for me, their's no longer a perceived barrier to entry to Mac, plus my wife is pushing for our next desktop to be a Mac... so I likely no longer have a choice <i>but</i> Mac.

Devs don't want to spend time learning the quirks of a window manager, we don't care; we care about....DEVELOPING!  When you've got something, like aqua, that just seems to continually get in your way, it sucks.<p>A personal example:\nA few years ago, my parents had just moved into a new house.  It was a really cool house, and they were really excited about it.  I thought it would be fun to create a spoof of that show that used to be on MTV called ""Cribs"" (Athletes and singers walk through their houses and show them off with some slow motion/fast motion transitions and some hip hop music).  A friend of mine helped by filming me walk around their house and host our fake cribs show.<p>When it came time to offload the video onto my PC, we ran into trouble, I didn't have the right firewire port for the cable we had (it was his camera).  ""No Problem"", I thought, ""I'll just plug it into my friend's laptop (a mac), copy the video to his machine, then SCP it to mine.""  Hooray, ""Unix-Under-The-Hood!"".\nWe imported the movie to ""iMovie"" (i think that is what it was), but I could NOT figure out how to save the video file.  There was no ""save"" or ""export"".  Nothing.  I could ""save to quicktime"" or ""save to the internet"" or ""save to $foo mac app"", but no ""Save to /home/scott/video.mpg"".<p>I finally had to ""export to quicktime"", then do a find. |grep *.mpg to find the thing.<p>THAT is the sort of ""getting in my way"" that seems to be not only acceptable at Apple, but standard and required.<p>Another example is iPods.  Ever try and take a song OFF of your ipod?  Yes, you can do it, but Apple tries to get in your way as much as they can.",1240868549

I send you a piece of paper requesting such and such information, you being the server sends me back a piece of paper with all the information I requested. Just instead of taking several weeks to send a request from one side of the world to the other, it may only take a few seconds.<p>Incidentally the version of the internet protocol being tested for use in space behaves even more like a postal system as they want to be able to store information in relay stations. So rather ironically, in the far future the internet will likely operate more like the postal service than ever before.<p>The mere fact of the matter is that until computers begin creating things exclusively of their own, all things computers run are made of the human mind and built of human systems and experience.<p>You refer to data miners, however have you ever seen the server farms they use for such tasks? There's thousands of computers in them, and incidentally tens or hundreds of thousands of individual processors.<p>I'd argue that when comparing a human to a computer, you should be comparing a human to a single core processor. Your data mining example is complete bunk when you consider the sheer amount of processors they use. Can 100,000 people do a data mining task? I'd guess yes.<p>Ed: If you doubt my claim that a large group of people cannot be the equivalent of a server farm for data mining, then you should read up on the history of how the Enigma Machine was cracked. The British invented the Colossus computer system specifically to speed up the work already done by humans in Bletchley Park.<p>Cryptanalysis is much more complicated than mere data mining, especially considering the enigma machine was actually designed to change to make it even more difficult to decipher.

Web surfing in bed (or lying on the couch,) playing simple games in bed, using recipes in the kitchen, videos and news on the road (like an iPhone without the iStrain.)  Put a notch in the back so you can hang it on a wall, and it's even more versatile (and even better in the kitchen.)  Plus it would be a nice compromise for traveling when the iPhone isn't enough -- have a bluetooth keyboard in your hotel room for blogging and email, carry a nice thin tablet during the day.<p>Actually, that last scenario pretty much sums it up.  It's a small laptop with no hinge, with the keyboard reduced to an optional accessory that you can leave in your briefcase, or in your hotel room, or on your bedside table, or wherever, except when you actually want to bother with it.<p>Of course, most tablets fail by integrating the keyboard, keeping the hinge, and not providing a decent touch-screen interface.

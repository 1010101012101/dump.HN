Todo lists are just flat files :)  I use ~/TODO for this purpose.<p>I discovered this by trying to write my own TODO manager:<p><a href=""http://git.jrock.us/?p=doqueue.git;a=summary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.jrock.us/?p=doqueue.git;a=summary</a><p>After working on that for a while, I realized I just wanted a flat file :)  Implementing the file was much faster than writing an entire application, I might add.<p>When I get some interest in working on this again, though, I will make a FUSE filesystem that gets the information from the web and makes a TODO file for you.  Then you can use the web interface when you're at a different computer (or you want to share TODOs with a friend), and the file otherwise.  It might be interesting.",1217417285

When and if the posts on the front page no longer match your interests, it's time to walk away and let the tragedy of the commons play out the third act.<p>I agree that it is very annoying not to be able to hide comments. I hope there is some incredibly important reason for this. Maybe it is explicitly to foster the kind of comment you made, to goad people into taking action when the quality of articles drops rather than tolerating dreck and linkbait by ignoring it?",1217415921

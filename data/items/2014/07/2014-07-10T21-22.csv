REST breaks down pretty rapidly once you get out of the key-value-store paradigm (read: anything involving child objects).<p>REST lacks the ability to relay full state-change semantics without hackery. As the article pointed out, it forces you to be extra chatty over http, which is far from free over the congested, global network that is the interwebs.<p>For example, what if a single PUT request creates multiple sub-objects? How does my server reply with multiple location headers? Do i have to first re-get the created object&#x27;s child locations and re-request each individually?<p>How about just sending the full object state back as the response to my PUT request? Well, according to REST, the body of the response just needs to be a description of the error or success status. Basically, REST sucks for reducing round trips if you&#x27;re going to follow it pedantically. The theory is sound, but it needs to be updated to dictate how the server can send back more detailed info in response to POST/PUT/PATCH requests.<p>/rant",1405029019

We manage the work by using work in progress limits.  However, we have a public releases that are scheduled every two weeks.  So on that scheduled release date, we take all the completed tasks lump them into a release.  Nothing holds up a release.  For high priority feature, we&#x27;ll do a hot fix.  For big announcements, we&#x27;ll usually schedule it after we&#x27;ve completed most of the work.<p>Scrum is the same in this regard at most companies.  A public release could happen after 1, 2, or 200 sprints.  It really just depends on what you&#x27;re trying to do.<p>In the Apple AppStore model, Kanban or Scrum should have no impact on how you deploy. You deploy when you&#x27;re ready.  Kanban no Scrum guarantee that it&#x27;ll happen by a certain date.",1405028784

The reason transit providers care more about upload bandwidth than download bandwidth is that customer ISPs can easily offer web hosting services to balance their traffic load, so it would be fruitless to charge the ISPs more for <i>not</i> sending the transit provider more traffic they have to carry. Better to give the ISPs free transit than that.<p>But Verizon isn&#x27;t the transit provider here, they&#x27;re the ISP.

Though it&#x27;s been a few decades, there were plenty from that group that had been arrested (some of whom I bailed out). Notice how I mention black folk?

For instance numerous &quot;macro dispatch characters&quot; like #&#x27;func #:sym #c(2.0 4.1) #(vec tor).  None of the syntactic cruft requires a LR(1) algorithm to work out; most of it is based on recognizing a character or two of prefix material and dispatching a read function.  When the dispatch involves two characters, the first one is almost always # (though for programming your own nonstandard read syntax, that is not a fixed rule.)  Read syntax is not even considered &quot;real&quot; syntax by Lisp programmers; &quot;real&quot; syntax is the structure of macros. But since macro forms are unambiguously written as nested lists, they already express the phrase structure almost directly; there is no phrase structure  that needs to be applied to get a syntax tree.<p>There isn&#x27;t any syntactic cruft in Lisp that will have you scratching your head as to what goes with what.<p>There are semantic head-scratchers related to syntax, like working out the implied actions of complicated, nested backquotes.

One, less people see the comment, so you&#x27;re less likely to get the correction upvote. And two, the priming effect kicks in, and people see your negatively voted comment as inherently negative, and don&#x27;t give it a correction upvote, or pile on.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this happen for a while.

And most of that content these days is free through streaming services.  A recent BloombergView article entitled, &#x27;Why Music is Dying&#x27;, articulates the decline that we&#x27;re seeing in listening habits:<p>http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-07-08/why-music-is-dying<p>That&#x27;s why I think a site like Spawnsong is important in this modern music ecosystem.  By having a platform that is comprised entirely of clipped representations of songs, we hope to make the flood more manageable.<p>The site launched in the beginning of March, was featured on techcrunch March 30th, and now I&#x27;m looking for a Django-proficient individual who can help me build out the more complex components of the site.  I&#x27;m willing to pony up serious equity for the right person, so if this sounds like an interesting concept to you, my e-mail is in my HN profile.<p>Let&#x27;s build the future of music discovery and distribution!",1405026140

Lisp, after all, can do everything, and do it every way; that Lisp is not already the de-facto programming language is just a reflection of the state of the world as a whole—only a very small percentage of the population are excited for the technological singularity, but the singularity is coming no matter how much people complain. One way or another, every programmer is going to end up being a Lisper, because every programming language continues to adopt features and syntax from Lisp, one piece at a time. It is in every programmer&#x27;s interest to master Lisp now, before the world at large realizes how essential Lisp will become over the next two decades.&quot;<p>The title is right, IMO. This is a difficult way to learn Lisp. I&#x27;m feeling the burn already.",1405026095

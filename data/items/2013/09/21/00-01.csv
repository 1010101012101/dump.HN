It&#x27;s an attack on someone&#x27;s character.<p>So, if you wanted to say &quot;misleading, maybe accidentally&quot;, you used the wrong word.<p>Maybe over time, people are evolving toward using the four-syllable word as a one-to-one replacement for the three-syllable word, as a way of disingenuously suggesting they&#x27;re better educated than they are?  If so, eventually, that&#x27;ll be the most common usage, and thus what the word &quot;means&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re there yet.<p>I came for the pedantry, but I&#x27;ll stay for an opinion: For myself, I agree with the wording you used in the first comment, that calling that list &quot;everything you need to know about web development&quot; is such a high degree of bullshit that no one of noble character would do that.  I believe it to be <i>deliberately deceptive</i> self-promotion.<p>Back on the pedantry, I find it hard to believe that you actually meant &quot;foster&quot; where you wrote that.

It can be easier and less daunting than it looks, and I totally get your description on how you feel about it at this point. Having your background in webdev you are closer to being able to do it than you may think.\nIf you take a look at something like the Haxe language (hard ECMA influence so not that far away from javascript) with its OpenFL framework, there are these: <a href=""https://github.com/dazKind/foo3D"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dazKind/foo3D</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/wighawag/openfl-stage3d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wighawag/openfl-stage3d</a><p>The first produces html5 and abstracts a lot of the complexity of the low level that other approaches are based on. The second is more c++ oriented at this point. Hope it helps, or at least leads you to finding your own path to doing it. It also allows you to escape some of the js madness that happens when you interact with this stuff for browser output. It allowed me to get to a level of production that I could not imagine possible just by looking at the opengl stuff.",1379724829

I for one am very bad at memorizing facts and forget them quite fast after not using them any more, no matter at which age I learned them first. Concerning mental arithmetic, I was quite good in 5th and 6th grade, but now I am painstakingly slow even with simple multiplications like 78 (&quot;Seven times eight was something like fifty-six, right? Let&#x27;s check, so seven times seven was forty-nine, forty-nine plus seven yeah, fifty six&quot;). I just don&#x27;t typically have to solve such problems at this time in my life (the closest I&#x27;ve come to needing arithmetic in the last few months was when I was studying Galois theory). But at least I am confident, that I <i>can</i> train myself, should the need arise.<p>The most frustrating experience with memorizations in school were poems for me, because it always took so much effort and even while I was slowly mastering it I knew it was all for naught, because in a few weeks everything would be gone again, even with those that I actually liked.",1379724167

Yes, it&#x27;s obvious once you break it down into those terms, but you&#x27;re waving away the part that&#x27;s not so obvious: that offering a product that&#x27;s easy to make and patrons want can be economically disadvantageous enough for a business to decide not to offer it. You&#x27;ve filed that under &quot;business reasons&quot;, but the specific business reason is the whole point.<p>Still, it seems to me like this shows a severe lack of creativity on the part of the business. A smarter way to do it would be to offer the Turkish coffee alone at an outrageous price that would deter people from ordering it and sitting around.

The reality is that probabilities can in a great deal of cases be expressed as the volume of something in some phase space, for a trivial example, consider the area under the curve between two x-values on the normal distribution&#x27;s probability density function -- it&#x27;s the 2-volume of a section of the Gaussiohedron.<p>So after branding quantum information science as the study of the &quot;unitarihedron&quot;, Aaronson dragged out one of his more miraculous results, which is that PP is closed under union and intersection as a direct result of PP = PostBQP, where PostBQP is a complexity class derived from BQP using an idea called <i>postselection</i>. That proof was actually in his dissertation (if I recall correctly), written in 2006, and it was an extremely impressive proof which did not use a word like &quot;unitarihedron&quot; to describe its methods.<p>So, while it was a joke, if you read the article in the context of the physics community&#x27;s reaction to the amplituhedron story, the included proof really just helps to drive the point home.<p>The methods now called &quot;amplituhedron&quot; have been under continuous development for the past ten years or so. My QFT professor[0] seemed sort of enthusiastic about the development. They do seem to represent a step forward in our understanding of quantum field theory, though the reaction of the media has been, in the eyes of some commentators, characteristically buzzword-driven.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predrag_Cvitanovic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predrag_Cvitanovic</a>",1379723681

You want to enter a v sophisticated field, like quantitative finance or Google search or whatever, that degree is really going to help. But if you just want to surround yourself with good data, good questions, data-loving friends, then I believe you can teach yourself. Absolutely.<p>Why do I think this? Because (1) the day-to-day of &quot;data science&quot; is more of a craft than a science. Before you run complicated analyses, you are just cleaning the data, visualizing it, trying to see what questions it could answer. It feels a lot like playing in the woods to me... you&#x27;re just knocking about, seeing what cool stuff is in there, building a fort out of scatterplots. And a truly wise data analyst will know when to <i>not</i> run tests at all. Also (2) it would surprise you how many academics are themselves kinda self-taught. They get into research because of their interest in a specific topic, and only come around to learning stats later. Think about it! The MCAT does <i>not</i> test prob/stats, even though doctors end up reading <i>reams</i> of statistical studies for work. I&#x27;m not saying these doctors are ignorant, not at all... just that after undergrad, they (and a bunch of PhD candidates) find themselves in the exact same position you&#x27;re in. They teach themselves, or they squeeze into stat dept courses, and they all turn out OK.<p>I would just look for the data that&#x27;s already around you. Cool data being produced at work?

But the thing is that, as you know, the academic world puts extreme pressure on people to both follow the rules and to makes themselves look good. When any violation of a rule-set can be called an &quot;ethical violation&quot; when it&#x27;s really not that, it cheapens the whole concept of ethics. Which isn&#x27;t surprising given how monumentally unethical it is to set up system.<p>Essentially, I can&#x27;t help seeing people with a lot of power engaging in seriously unethetical things and happy to blur the lines between that and people cuts corners in response to pressure (and that stuff winds up being more pressure on people which doesn&#x27;t actually stop the corner-cutting).",1379721660

Just curious if you were comparing this based solely on past experiences.  (That is, when making a &quot;service&quot; with Jersey, there is surprisingly little boilerplate.  There is the verbosity of Java, but pretty much none of the other.)<p>And, really, it mainly depends on how you want to structure your application.  At face value, an angularjs/whatever frontend that calls to whatever REST implementation you can bring to works quite well.<p>Regarding JSP, yeah, planning on avoiding that as much as possible, though, for a quick &quot;put a dummy string into a page,&quot; I can&#x27;t say it is that terrible.  (I fully grant that is a very slippery slope.",1379721659

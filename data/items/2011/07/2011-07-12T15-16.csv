Sure, maybe it's a simple game, but it's hardly a get rich quick fart app.<p>Are you aware that though it's ultimately a Javascript app, it was built using the Forplay framework (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/forplay/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/forplay/</a>), which includes a (very slightly modified) version of JBox2d (the Java port of Box2d) for physics, compiled down to JS through GWT? See <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/forplay/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fcore%2Fgwtbox2d%2Forg%2Fjbox2d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/forplay/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%...</a> - that's almost exactly the JBox2d trunk, with a few modifications because of a couple of things that GWT doesn't allow (reflection, for instance).<p>I assure you, we did <i>not</i> have GWT in mind when porting Box2d to Java, so there are no special optimizations for it or anything, we've always just targeted pure Java - GWT didn't even exist at the time, and even once it showed up, I was so convinced that it could never run fast enough for physics that I didn't even bother to try.  You can see the results yourself, most of the demos (other than the stress tests, which are supposed to be slow) run quite well for me on recent versions of Chrome, Safari, and FF: <a href=""http://gwtbox2d.appspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gwtbox2d.appspot.com/</a>",1310486306

Or do different words tend to have different effects?<p>2) Normal readers tend to read the ""word"" and not the individual letters. Do/Can dyslexics do the same? As an example, if for instance dyslexics commonly were to transpose the ""o"" and ""u"" combination ""ou"" to ""uo"" I'm wondering if dyslexics read the jumbled ""yuo"" immediately as ""you"" or, does dyslexia prevent you from even recognizing the pattern and you have to laboriously read ""y"" ""u"" ""o"", transpose ""o"" and ""u"" and recognize ""you"".<p>The reason I ask is because I'm curious if such a typeface might actually be hurtful to dyslexic readers. While the typeface is easier to read for dyslexics I wonder if using such a type face for initial reading education would have a side effect. When the reader switches to non dyslexic type faces, %99.99 the rest of all digital type, they will have diminished capacity for reading those texts (more so than having learned to cope with the frequent errors of those type faces)?<p>In other words, might the best solution to be educating dyslexics by recognizing they may see different or multiple letter patterns for certain words and simply train them to recognize each possible version of those letter patterns?<p>IE. Here's a vocabulary sheet for Johny, a non dyslexic child:<p><pre><code>    ""mouse"" - a small four legged mammal.
    ""house"" - a building you live in.
</code></pre>
The same vocabulary sheet for Mikey, a dyslexic child.<p><pre><code>    ""mouse"", ""muose"" - a small four legged mammal.
    ""house"", ""huose"" - a building you live in.
</code></pre>

You get hired, and solve problems.  Time passes and you get better at solving these problems, so they give you harder problems in the same domain space.  Eventually you get so good at solving these problems in this domain space that you become The Guy.  ""Oh you have a question about the FooWidget manager tool?  Ask Joe, he's the FooWidget guy.""  By definition, being The Guy has mean you've reached a local maxima of productivity in the company.<p>It also means you're bored.  It's not a case of possibly being bored, or eventually becoming bored.  Once you are are no longer a problem solver, that means you're bored.<p>I've been a lead engineer at two different companies thus far in my career, and every time I end up wailing the same things to management.  ""You have to let me get Joe off FooWidgets.  He's been working on it for nearly years and all you make him do are stupid enhancements nobody actually uses.""  But then who will maintain FooWidgets?  ""Hire someone.  You could hire a college kid for the level enhancements you guys want.  Or let me assign it to someone else on my team.  But do something, because he is going to get bored and quit and we'll have to do this anyway, only Joe won't even be here to help transition.""  Will we be able to make enhancements to FooWidgets as fast if someone else works on it?  ""Not at first, but within a month--"" Bzzt, wrong answer, Joe's still on FooWidgets.  And sure enough, within six months, Joe takes another position and we're hosed.<p>So while Rands had some good heuristics for detecting boredom, you typically don't even need to ask them directly or look for behavior changes.  Are they solving problems?  If not, they're bored, and you have a ticking clock to do something about that engineer before he leaves.",1310485355

This will result in code much shorter, cleaner, more general, more useful, and more readable code than what is found in this blog post.<p>The author hasn't achieved the abstraction of a monad in C++ anyway; there's no way to write code that works on both this monad and others, which effectively makes modeling something as a monad as he has done completely without benefit. This would be quite accurately referred to as cargo cult programming.<p>A monad explanation that is not cargo cult mathematics would be one that explains what a monad is in category theory (a functor with two associated natural transformations), explains it as one of many other patterns, and explains why simply including monads and these other patterns in your code does not automatically give them the Mathematical Seal of Approval, especially when using a language with no support for abstracting over them.",1310483946

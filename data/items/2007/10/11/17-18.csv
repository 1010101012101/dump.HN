Having researched this topic many times I believe  Michael Spence has cornered why and how a degree is useful:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Spence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Spence</a><p>To summarize a degree or certification is a signal of private information from an agent to a principal.  Nothing more, nothing less.  If you can replace that signal with another kind of signal (ie experience/references/monument made in your name) you don't need it.<p>",1192125578

66354,comment,66292,66292,0,0,bls,,,"I tried to tutor Computer Science while I was an undergraduate. My clients were always people who would call me around finals time and ask me to help them cram. There were seniors who simply could not write computer programs--some might have a vague notion of what a loop is, but not enough to actually write a (trivial) program using one. I often had to stop the tutoring sessions, because I simply could not help them without just doing the homework myself.<p>I watched many of those people graduate with B.S. degrees in Computer Science from my university. If I ever need to hire a developer, I will actively avoid anybody that graduated from my own university. Once I realized that, I quit.<p>Having said that, some places have rules that won't allow them to hire you without a degree. If you want to work for these kinds of places, you need the degree. However, I think that a degree requirement is a good indicator of a bad place to work.",1192124613

66338,comment,65936,65936,0,0,vishaldpatel,,,"Berkeley Pluses:\n- Everything is in walking distance if you live around downtown - from the grocery shops, to the many many good, cheap (compared to East Coast) restaurants, and the BART (subway) that takes you to San Francisco in 20 - 25 minutes.<p>- Office space, the last time I checked was about $2 per square foot. Check: \n<a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/off/eby?query=&minAsk=min&maxAsk=max&minSqft=min&maxSqft=max&neighborhood=48"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/off/eby?query=&minAsk...</a><p>- University town - the campus libraries are among the best places are awesome. The Berkely gym and the downtown YMCA here are also really excellent.<p>- The weather is really nice - not as cold and windy as SF, and not as hot as San Jose. It warms up and cools down very gradually here - and usually stays between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius.\n \n- The parks and the marina are great. There is pretty good hiking, and the sailing club here will get you sailing (or wind-surfing)! For cheap! (www.cal-sailing.org). <p>Cons:\n- It is dirty in places - it doesn't smell though.\n- There are lots of homeless people here - quite harmless.\n- Everything shuts down early. Berkeley is a town more than a city. There are two 'night-clubs' - only one is worth any time - the other is a dirty (in a bad way) hole in the ground. Only a couple of bars and restaurants are open late - thankfully they're quite good. Lucky for you, San Francisco is less than half an hour away by public transit. There's a bus that drives back every half an hour all night long.<p>Non-issues:\n- ""Activism"". big deal - some people like to protest - they don't come in your way or bother you. You are invited to participate and the locals can be engaging and opinionated if you talk to them. This is one of the most educated places I've ever lived in - that is a good thing.<p>Conclusion:\n- Berkeley is great! You can raise your kids here. You can live in a relatively quite place but live very close to two main cities - Oakland and San Fran - so you can go crazy and then return to relax and work in a quieter place. \n",1192122132
66337,comment,66180,66318,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Some people just like to do whatever they please.""<p>Technically, entrepreneurs can't do whatever they please either.  They have to do what their customers say.<p>That's perhaps a good test for whether you'll make a good founder: how do you react when asked to do something by a customer, vs. how do you react when asked to do something by your boss?  If you jump to attention for the customer but blow off the boss, you'll probably do fine.  If you jump to attention for the boss but blow off the customer (far more people do this than you'd think), you're better off as an employee.  If you won't do anything for anyone, you have a very difficult life ahead of you.",1192122124
66336,comment,66292,66292,0,0,aristus,,,"I have no degree. I have worked for tiny startups, small businesses, Yahoo, the IRS Modernization Project, Big Co Consulting companies, with degree-heavy dev teams and with multi-talented cowboy hackers. I never planned on taking the man's money either. But I go where there is interesting work. There is a pay discount <i>wherever</i> you go and are not a founder. I have ten years' experience but usually not the same pay as someone with 10 + bachelor's, or even 5 + master's.<p>Often, I have lacked the theory, the mathematics and the discipline of creating and analyzing algorithms. It is a big hole that takes years to become aware of. <p>Another hard-to-see hole is what you take for granted in college or a tech-heavy city: where else are you going to meet other people with the same interests, work on problems with them, have late-night bull sessions, etc?<p>So now that I live a few train stops from Berkeley I am taking some of the harder courses that people have said are worthwhile.<p>Take the good stuff. Meet people. Stay loose. Follow the interesting problems. But take neither the pros or cons of college too seriously. You are choosing the general heading of a ship, not choosing a single set of tracks.",1192122077

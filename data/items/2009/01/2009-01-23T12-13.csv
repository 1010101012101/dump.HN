446296,comment,445707,446223,0,0,zmimon,,,"There's a lot happening with it ...  I think it's main advantage is that it completely seamlessly integrates with java and inherits it's basic syntax from there, so anyone familiar with java or with existing stuff in java (and that's a lot of people) can get a flying start.  Groovy on Grails is where the main action is - it's basically a rails clone, but built on a standard java stack so if you need it you can always peel back the covers and access it.<p>I too initially thought of it as a dead end - why choose a language that <i>only</i> runs on the JVM when you can choose a language that runs natively as well?  But once I started using it I really liked it, and the integration with java is really superb (much more seamless than Jython, JRuby etc.).  So it kind of stuck.  (I use Django as well, but not as much).",1232714228

Someone knowing that the complex thing I want to do is already in NumPy and she used it herself yesterday and here's a snippet of code pasted into my IM is priceless. Similarly I might say, oh, I wrote some code that does nearly your thing, you could just change this one line. Pretty much anything I need I could code up myself in a half a day or a day, but all those half days add up.<p>More than one project I've started in Lisp here (not to pick on Lisp, just as an example) and run into an issue that I <i>could</i> implement myself in time T or do the whole lot in Python in time T/10. It's a no-brainer. For non-trivial tasks to be completed within fixed periods, striking out on your own with a new language is a meaningless risk.",1232714140

446290,comment,446143,446143,0,0,thinkzig,,,"Congratulations on your launch.  The concept sounds like a good one.  Here are a few comments...<p>1.) Tighten up your USP on the home page - It's not obvious what you're doing at first glance of the home page.  The big blue block of text in the middle is too wordy and hard to read.  Try to distill what you're doing down to a pithy tagline.<p>2.) Emphasize benefits more on home page - I like how you've split up the home page to cater to your two audiences, publishers and recruiters, but the text underneath seems to be more of a feature list or a ""how it works"" list than a benefits list.<p>Try to focus more on the ""What's in it for me?"" question your core audience is asking.  ""Get access to the smartest and most engaged people"" is probably the only sentence there that really speaks to that question.<p>3.) Emphasize sign-up more - My guess is that your main goal right now is to get account sign-ups.  The hand pointing to the button is clever, but I think you could do more to make this stand out.  Also the big green ""place a job now"" image under the recruiter section seems like it would be a button, but it's not.  I'd turn it into one.<p>4.) Building trust - I think my first question as a blogger/publisher would be ""What keeps JBH.com and the recruiter honest?  How will I really know that my referral was the winner or not?""  I'm not sure how you overcome this, but that was my first question/objection and I didn't really see anything on the ""how it works"" page that helped allay that fear.<p>Overall I think this is a good concept and I wish you well.  It's a tough market right now but there's no time to start like the present, right?  Hopefully we all have nowhere to go but up from here.<p>Best of luck to you.",1232713561

446286,comment,445389,445875,0,0,BvS,,,"1) I agree that they made some online comments while hiding their identity. On the other hand they apologized in a way that makes me believe that they will not do it again (check their blog or the mp3s of the board meeting following the incident).<p>2) They are totally transparent about their salaries which are obviously only a fraction of what they earned while working for hedge fonds (around 60,000 for NYC isn't that much, is it?). Since they are trying to allocate donation money to the ngos which are most efficient, they are actually doing a very important job. Having worked in development aid myself I can assure you that the output (saved lives... )per $ varies probably even more than if you compare programmers in a tech company. Just giving everyone the same amount although one is ten time as productive doesn't seem like a good idea.<p>3) I haven't heared about any ngo as transparent as GiveWell (providing the records of their board meetings as an mp3 is just one example, check out their website for more).<p>4) Just because they have worked for a hedge fund in the past means that they are up to no good?

446282,comment,445512,445731,0,0,glenstein,,,"The metadata was NOT collected because the NSA cared about adhering to constitutional safeguards, they did it out of practicality. They were operating in an utterly intractable and vast ocean of communications information that could not possibly be monitored wholesale. When they thought they should transgress the line of metadata (assuming for a moment that ""metadata"" is for some reason less private) they did.<p>>Now the actual recording of calls and data of communications, as opposed to metadata -- that's another animal entirely.<p>This is exactly what they did, and it was in facilitation of precisely this purpose that the metadata was gathered. As it says in the article:<p>>Tice said the NSA analyzed metadata to determine which communication would be collected. Offering a hypothetical example, he said if the agency determined that terrorists communicate in brief, two-minute phone calls, <i>the NSA might program its systems to record all such calls, invading the privacy of anyone prone to telephonic succinctness</i>.<p>and:<p>>he discovered that the NSA was collecting the organizations' communications 24 hours a day year round.<p>Over and over again, defenders of wiretapping and invasions of privacy have tried to suggest that issues of security become so grave or complicated that at some point our rights to privacy fall away, or are impossible to guarantee, as though they don't operate in tandem, but rest on polar opposite ends of a sliding scale.<p>Why do I hear a defeaning silence the moment I ask if this power is open to abuse? What stops the NSA from being ordered to gather metadata on political opponents, activist organizations, or news reporters? What stops them from learning what those communication channels are, thereby obtaining the power to disrupt them? This is <i>exactly</i> what happened. Doesn't this scare anyone?<p>Where is the differentiation between abuse and dutiful defense of country? Where is even the acknowledgement of the possibility of abuse? I don't see it, and until it is recognized, we leave unchecked the issue rampant abuse of power under the guise of fighting the glorious fight against terrorism.<p>Just as the technology enables the ""war on terrorism"" to spill over into dimensions unanticipated by the framers of the constitution, requiring that we supply our intelligence agencies with new legal tools to continue the fight, there is a paralell duty that we prevent the government from seizing the same space for the purpose of advancing surveillance state powers.",1232712680

446278,comment,445512,445802,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"You're making two mistakes.<p>One: you are confusing criminal law with intelligence. ""hearsay"" and ""unproven"" are criminal law concepts, used when the state wishes to deprive you of some of your rights, such as when you are being investigated or prosecuted.<p>Two: you are representing ""link to terrorist"" as some sort of boolean condition when in fact it's multi-dimensional. EVERYBODY has links to terrorists. I call the neighborhood pizza store who has an owner that SMSs PeeWee Herman on a regular basis who visits the web site of a known supporter of Hamas. We're all linked to terrorists -- it's like the seven degrees of Kevin Bacon concept. The point of meta-analysis is to take all of that random noise and gather meaningful meta-data in order to pursue.<p>Once the government becomes interested in me, personally, we start moving from intelligence to crime -- assuming I am a U.S. citizen. If I am a foreign citizen, then it's simply plain old intelligence-gathering.<p>The weirdness is that multi-node transports now can cover areas of both criminal law and intelligence gathering, but the laws are all written for one or the other. There has to be some allowance for work in-between the two concepts.<p>We have some precedence. It's legal, for instance, for authorities to search your trash without a warrant.There is no presumption of privacy when using computers owned by somebody else, such as your employer.<p>There's a lot of legal work to be done in these areas. I want the government completely out of my life, but that ain't happening. In any society in which a strong contingent wants to control and shape every form of energy I use (to prevent global warming), then we've gone beyond the old days and are in new territory. The game now, from a libertarian viewpoint, is damage control.<p>EDIT: I can see where we might have a misunderstanding. When you're concerned that tracking the types and messages from you is infringing on your rights, you're assuming that the government can identify you. I have no idea how NSA is doing its work, but the idea of signals intelligence is that people are just nodes. The association of the data with your identity is another subject entirely. (Of course, attributes about the node, such as location, occupation, religious history, etc. are fair game. Just not identification. Who you actually are is irrelevant.)",1232712003

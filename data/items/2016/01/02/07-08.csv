Since Apple doesn&#x27;t do the latter it has to do the former which means requires constantly growing the company.<p>So while in logic the endless growth is a bit absurd in the stock market it&#x27;s either that or dividends (and even dividends may not keep it raising; all depends on how they&#x27;re structured).",1451720492

After training it for like 10min it worked better or equal as good as Ford&#x27;s Sync car assistent (offline) and Siri/GoogeNow/Cortana. Well all these services licensed the Nuance speech technology which they got from buying the company behind Dragon natural speaking software.

10825455,comment,10818560,10818560,0,0,jcrawfordor,,,"VCRs behaved a little odd surrounding pausing. You probably remember back in the day - a paused VCR would show the frame it was paused on, but usually poorly, with some noise, a bit out of alignment.<p>This is related to the mechanical design of VHS tapes and the player. VCRs use helical scanning. What this means is that each frame of video is recorded on the VHS tape in a linear track that runs diagonally across the tape. Inside the VHS player, you may remember seeing a drum in the back that seems at an off angle. This is the helical read drum: it spins at a very high speed as the tape is pulled around it, and the combination of the slanted head drum spinning and the tape moving along it at a lower speed results in the heads mounted to the drum tracing these diagonal lines on the tape.<p>The TV draws to the screen continuously, 29.97 times per second, and draws whatever is coming on the analog video input at that moment. So for the image to remain when you have paused the tape, the VCR must continuously play the same frame back to the television. This requires keeping the drum moving and alternating the tape drive (the capstan motor) back and forth very rapidly to try to keep the same helical track aligned with the head over and over. This never quite works right, leaving a noisy signal that often has a bit of a shake as the tracking goes in and out each frame. Additionally, the capstan rapidly switching directions can damage the tape, which is why most VCRs will switch to Stop after being paused for a few minutes.<p>Laserdiscs had this problem much worse, as there was simply no practical way to get the disc back to the beginning of a frame quickly enough to rescan it. Higher-end laserdisc players could show a freeze-frame, but they did it with an electronic framebuffer that was digitally replayed to the TV. I wonder if there may have been higher-end VCRs with this same technology, but I haven&#x27;t seen one.",1451720261

JS has higher level semantics that admit varying implementation strategies - for example, all major engines use tagged pointers, but they all do it somewhat differently (e.g. V8 does not use NaN-boxing but others do); or on a macro level, those semantics require a garbage collector, which has a ton of implementation choices.  Because JS engines are JITs, they perform optimizations informed by runtime information, which are more flexible but for that reason far more prone to guesswork, e.g. about what information to record, what kinds of assumptions to make about types mostly being static in practice, etc.  And all JS engines have to balance runtime against compilation time, even to some extent for very hot loops, so they tend to have relatively simple optimization pipelines that value pragmatism over being able to cover every possibility.<p>The result is a lot of idiosyncrasy and a large number of little decisions and strategies that together can be highly significant but are hard to just port from one engine to another.<p>Notably, perhaps as a result, there seems to be a trend to basically rewrite JS engines&#x27; JITs while keeping the same name.  V8 did this with Crankshaft in 2010 and is in the process of doing it again with Turbofan (dunno whether it will ultimately replace Crankshaft or just complement it, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised at the former, considering that there is currently a large amount of duplicated functionality between them).

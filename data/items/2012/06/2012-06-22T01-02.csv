4145068,comment,4142381,4142553,1,0,chernevik,,,"Here's a question: If Citi was selling out-of-compliance loans to Fannie and Freddie and the FHA, why aren't those institutions forcing Citi to buy those loans back?  Likewise JP Morgan, Bank of America, etc.<p>I don't know the answer and there might be a good one.<p>But I can't help noticing that these institutions were ""too big too fail"", that substantial sums were advanced and pledged to keep them afloat, and that their preservation has been an important consideration of Fed policy for going on five years.<p>It isn't too hard to imagine a decision to accept additional losses among the GSEs and federal housing agencies for the higher purpose of keeping the US financial system afloat.  Please note that Fannie and Freddie are something like $100 billion in the hole to the Federal government, financial catastrophes that dwarf any bailout extended and yet have somehow escaped the public attention proportionate to their amazing losses.  (Indeed we have politicians advocating still greater losses for them as part of efforts to settle the housing market.)<p>These banks are big beyond the wisdom or fortitude of public officials to conduct prudent and and equitable policy.  If banks that big exist, they'll earn rents based on their regulatory position, and their executives' compensation be essentially free from any market discipline.  And those banks and executives will provide political contributions and favors and soft landings to politicians and regulators whose views will matter so much to their profitability.  It's an ""iron triangle"" secured by the governments' regulatory monopoly and the flow of capital through the system.<p>The expansion of the government into housing finance through the GSEs and various guarantors only makes the situation worse.<p>There is no doubt that smaller banks lead to higher capital costs and accepting lower slower economic growth.  There are real economies of scale in these businesses.  But realizing that potential contribution requires an intelligence and integrity of regulation, over sustained periods of time, that is simply beyond the institutional capacities of public institutions.  They thus accumulate excess risks, which translate to costs, which ultimately consume their promised potential and leave us with net losses.  And political distortions to boot.<p>There are few on this board more conservative than I.  But US banking policy must be put into a place where no one can fail to know that the failure of any US financial institution will result in losses for its capital providers, equity and debt, with no possibility of public intervention on any basis.  The freedom of our economy and polity must be distorted to the extent of our deviation from that state.",1340330375

4145060,story,,,15,30,robomartin,"Why are vi[m] efficient code editors?",,"This started on another thread where I got throttled pretty badly because of my opinion that, in the context of a non-trivial project, vi[m] offer no real gains, particularly when one considers timelines, code quality, bugs, costs, etc.<p>I am always one interested in learning.  And that is why I decided to launch this thread.  To be clear, I am not interested in engaging in ""mine is better than yours"" discussions that invariably lead to flame wars.<p>The intent is to hear from vi[m] expert users on the reasons those of us who, like me, only touch vi[m] when absolutely forced to, or others who chose to avoid vi[m] or barely know anything about these editors should seriously consider what vi[m] have to offer.<p>I propose that posts should take the form of reproducible recipes.  Give us, vi[m] neophytes, steps to follow in order to understand how one might do a specific task more efficiently using vi[m].  Please don't engage in comparing it to anything else.  If we keep it to vi[m] recipes then this thread stands a chance of becoming an educational resource for those of us not familiar with these methods.<p>This also means that making claims about vi[m] efficiency supported by saying something akin to ""every programmer who uses vi[m] thinks so"" are not acceptable.  Only recipes.<p>Also, in the interest of fairness, the recipes should work with unmodified vi[m].  Requiring the loading of plug-ins of various kinds muddles things as the same could be true of other editors.<p>In addition to this, let's not talk about things like memory foot print or binary size.  With today's multi-gigahertz-multi-gigabyte computers this really is immaterial.<p>A recipe could start by suggesting to clone a certain github repository, then opening a specific file with vi[m] and then offering-up a series of commands that show how to derive efficiency gains from vi[m].<p>On my end, I have access to OSX, Linux, Irix, Solaris and emulators on Windows machines.  Other readers might only have one platform available.  Please indicate if your recipe, for some reason, requires a specific platform.<p>Finally, please don't comment on my introductory (first) paragraph.  Only recipes and discussions that ask questions or offer clarifications on the recipe in question.<p>Thanks.",1340330137

4145057,comment,4142271,4144902,7,0,Jach,,,"Unspoken truths often turn out to be false. Without hard figures it's a tough call to say what the reality really is. (I'm still amazed Netflix itself takes up ~20% of the US internet traffic, and it's all authorized.) For torrent sites it's easier to get the figures, for Megaupload it isn't. Hence my curiosity, I guess I'll just have to wait for the trial.<p>The more interesting case to me is whether one paints a service on distinct counts of items or on total traffic per item. PirateBay makes it easy to see what the hottest torrents are (<a href=""http://thepiratebay.se/top/all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thepiratebay.se/top/all</a>); I'd be surprised if any are authorized. If we assume a power law then most of torrent traffic certainly infringes. For Megaupload, perhaps it was the same. But I'm more inclined to think Megaupload's distinct counts fall closely in line with Youtube's--it's trivial for copyright owners to take their content down with either a DMCA request or the tools the sites provide, meanwhile tons of user-generated content is appearing that actually belongs to the user. MediaFire seems like the place to go these days for sharing your songs, even professional artists use it sometimes. I don't think it's that much of a stretch to consider that for Youtube and perhaps Megaupload, there is more non-infringing content than infringing in absolute terms even if the infringing content takes up the supermajority of traffic.",1340329983

The flaw is that every app decides it's own keybindings, and ignores the preference the user has set for his system.<p>Rather than a standard, we need a better API abstraction for keybinding, where users can control their keybindings from a single point, and it'll affect all their apps at once. App developers shouldn't tie functionality to specific keys, but to some abstract keys which the user controls.<p>I use Dvorak layout, but I generally prefer the conventional key locations for common tasks. So for example, cua-mode in emacs, I expect undo/cut/copy/paste to be in the locations of z,x,c,v on qwerty, except they're ;qjk on dvorak. It's awkward to make each app support this configuration - particularly when they all require a different language to configure.<p>Also, when a user configures his layout, he should be able to specify whether individual applications can override those keybindings or not - apps should request key combinations rather than assume they're available.<p>---<p>The personality types is an interesting thought, but I don't think it's really a big deal, because if you can't predict people, you just need to set a trend and make them predictable :p.<p>The editor wars are really blown out of proportion because of popularity or fashion rather than their technical merits. People are emotionally attached to their tools and aren't interested in the other anyway. I mean, who has the time to learn both emacs and vi enough to compare them objectively anyway? I've not used vi enough to really assess it's capabilities.<p>Maybe the personality type could give an indicator of a default setting for developers to put in. I'd be surprised if there's no research in this area, considering every desktop developer claims ""we're building what users want after conducting usability tests."" (I'd like to know who the audience for GNOME's testing was.)<p>---<p>I do hope tiling features will make it into desktop systems. Bluetile is an interesting example for gnome integration, although completely broken for gnome3.<p>Another interesting app is Opera. Their tabs have been based on MDI since day one (mid 90s). It basically has it's own internal WM, which includes some tiling features. (Opera's initial tabs were really tiles before they became the tabs we all know now.)<p>I think the other desktop environments are a bit slow on the takeup with tiling, and it's perhaps come to a grinding halt with the focus on tablets and touch now. We probably need to start experimenting with introducing touch into our tiling WMs to support heterogeneous inputs rather than exclusively keyboard too.<p>Probably the biggest joy about tiling WMs is that they're not some fixed system we're forced into using by the trendsetters, but they're more like APIs for developing your own personalized WM in. Until we build some customization abilities that don't require modifying code though, they probably won't become too popular - only minor features leaking into other systems.",1340328622

And when Chase pulled the referrals, he removed them from that page which ""After stripping out all the Chase stuff, my credit cards page is looking a little bare these days"".<p>What does it tell us about his impenetrable integrity when his recommendations are predicated on the recommended product paying him? Surely Chase can't keep him from recommending the card - that would indeed be a free speech issue.<p>And no, it's not a principled stand against Chase: ""Well see if we can find a less fearful company (or Chase rep) to step back up to the plate eventually.""",1340326862
4144934,comment,4144621,4144884,3,0,Retric,,,"That's a function of both inflation rate and your expected ROI.  Using 3% inflation and 6% ROI you need to reinvest ~51.6% of your income to break even. (1-(ROI-((1/(1-inflation rate))-1)))/ ROI = 1-(.06-((1/(1-.03))-1))/.06 = ~51.6%
Edit: Ok there must be a simpler way to write that...<p>((1/(1-inflation))-1) / ROI = ((1/(1-.03))-1)/.06 = 51.6%<p>PS: Just keeping what left over when you subtract the inflation rate from your ROI is close and you don't actually know the inflation rate or your long term ROI most of the time.",1340326858
4144933,comment,4143532,4144580,13,0,matwood,,,"<i>I'm curious what your parents taught you about personal responsibility. My theory is it's less about whether you grow up in poverty as it is about growing up being taught you're a victim, that everything bad in your life is the result of other people hating you or taking what should be yours, etc. If you feel everything that you have or don't have is the result of things other people are giving you or taking from you, you learn that you are not in control of your destiny.</i><p>My story is similar to mindcrimes.  I don't remember my parents ever blaming anyone else or being victims.  My moms lessons were fairly simple.  Work hard, don't get a girl pregnant, and go to college.<p>My dad was a quiet guy who just worked hard.  If I complained about something not being fair he didn't care.  ""Life isn't fair. Now what are you going to do?""  I can still clearly remember him and my mom fighting over food stamps.  We qualified, and my mom wanted to get them but he refused.  Instead he got another side job.<p>The other thing he always did was put outcomes squarely on me.  It didn't matter if it really was another persons fault, he always asked what could <i>I</i> have done differently to change the situation.<p>I'll quit rambling now, but let me say y level of perfectionism and work ethic clearly came from my dad.  It's probably not always healthy, but it has worked out pretty well so far :)",1340326840

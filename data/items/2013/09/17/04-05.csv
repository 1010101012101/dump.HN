6397656,comment,6397527,6397527,7,0,seldo,,,"There&#x27;s a very important lesson in here about investing, but not the one the author intended. From the article:<p>&quot;Suppose you find a stock that you know will increase in value.  You go to the bank and say, “hey, can I borrow $90k to buy this stock?  I’ll put down a down payment of $10k.”  You’ll be laughed right out of there.&quot;<p>And then, later:<p>&quot;Now suppose you find a house that you think is a good deal for $100k. ... suppose you go into the bank and say “hey, can I borrow $90k to buy this house, and I’ll put down $10k?”  If you have decent credit, you’ll get the loan easily.&quot;<p>Leverage, i.e. a multiplication of your investment by borrowing money, is quite frowned upon when investing in stocks[1] but is not frowned upon, in fact positively encouraged, when investing in real estate. This is because &quot;owning a home&quot; has a sentimental value attached to it by policy makers that equity investing does not. It is a weird market distortion caused by bad policy, particularly in the US.<p>Leverage by retail investors is frowned upon because they can get badly burned and lose a ton of money. Real estate is not as volatile as equities, but as the financial crisis of 2007 showed, large numbers of retail investors going into real estate solely as a speculative investment can lose them huge amounts of money.<p>In all investing, the size of your return is related to the risk you are taking on. If you can get a 30% return investing in housing, as the author suggests, and only 6-7% investing in mutual funds, that&#x27;s because housing is 4-5x more risky than a mutual fund. Higher returns are not just sitting around waiting for you to notice how much more money you can make.<p>So by all means leverage away if you&#x27;ve got capital and want to take on more risk for the chance of higher reward, but don&#x27;t go into it thinking it&#x27;s an &quot;almost guaranteed way&quot; to make money, as the author has concluded.<p>[1] Unless you are a large bank, but that&#x27;s a whole other story.",1379393853

The relationships between specific emotions and virality suggest that the role of emotion in transmission is more complex than mere valence alone (Table 4, Model 3). While more awe-inspiring (a positive emotion) content is more viral and sadness inducing (a negative emotion) content is less viral, some negative emotions are positively associated with virality. More anxiety- and anger-inducing stories are both more likely to make the most e-mailed list. This suggests that transmission is about more than simply sharing positive things and avoiding sharing negative ones. Consistent with our theorizing, content that evokes high-arousal emotions (i.e., awe, anger, and anxiety), regardless of their valence, is more viral.&quot;",1379392451

It might sound impractical, but I&#x27;ve found some workarounds for it. Which is to use my debit card as a credit card. Go frugal for a few days and save some money in the savings account, then use that money as credit to yourself. The worst thing about any kind of debt/loan is the interest part. Lesser interest you pay the better, except in situation where you are making an investment with the loan(like buying a property of a home) and the value of the investment is growing faster, when the at the same time inflation is decreasing your loan&#x27;s net value.<p>Second advice I can give you is to buy your own home and avoid paying rent. If you look at the whole thing having your own home is vastly more profitable than renting some one else&#x27;s home on a long term.<p>Then there are a few assorted advices I would like to give, especially to people in India(My country), But I believe it applies equally to else where to. Buy gold in small quantities regularly. Gold is protected from inflation, and is the near standard of economic growth around the world. And value of growth(over long term) always grows. Once you have sufficient gold- sell it and, learn to buy real estate in city outskirts. You will see in any growing city, sooner or later outskirts merge into main city areas and then real estate prices shoot up. Take loans to do this, if and only if the loan is small and as I said before, inflation affects your loan faster than, the rate at which its value grows.<p>Make the mandatory 1 lac per year(if you can&#x27;t make as much as you can), tax savings investments on things like endowment insurances which serve as both life insurance and long term investments.<p>Its good if you could rotate money by building a home which you could rent out. It will serve as a steady source of income later and after retirement.<p>Lastly at the risk of attracting downvotes, please don&#x27;t invest in stocks and show pointless heroics if you don&#x27;t understand that business. Far more people have burnt their hard savings hoping for magical miracles to happen and make them millionaire while dealing in stocks. In short if you know how to do it, do it. Else keep out for your own good.",1379391522

If a secret did last for decades, you wouldn&#x27;t know about it.<p>No, I meant secrets that quickly came out (that weren&#x27;t secret for long), versus things that were only revealed after a long time. It&#x27;s a reasonable yardstick for the degree that things can be kept secret &quot;for decades&quot;, my claim.<p>Things that really have remained secret:<p>* Where Jimmy Hoffa&#x27;s body is buried.<p>* What happened to Judge Crater (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Force_Crater"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Force_Crater</a>)<p>* What women want. Freud famously asked. but no one knows, certainly not women. This may belong in a different category, since it&#x27;s not clear that anyone knows the secret.<p>> A US bomber accidentally dropped a hydrogen bomb out of an airplane into the dessert near Albuquerque, New Mexico, triggering a conventional but non-nuclear detonation. This happened in 1957 but was kept secret until 1986<p>So that&#x27;s in the never-revealed secrets column? Just checking.<p>> This secret [Enigma] was revealed in 1974--after 34 years--because of two books by key intelligence figures.<p>Actually, it was because of the British Official Secrets Act, that required silence on sensitive matters until the government granted permission, and that was obeyed by all concerned. The books were&#x27;t simply published, after due consideration they were vetted by the authorities in advance of publication. That example belongs in the well-kept secrets act, because everyone involved obeyed the rules until given permission to do otherwise. If it had been a 50 year silence requirement, I suspect that it would still have been obeyed.<p>But I think you&#x27;ll agree that rare exceptions don&#x27;t disprove rules.<p>> I&#x27;m commenting only about the persistent meme that big secrets are quickly exposed: it&#x27;s not necessarily true.<p>Not &quot;quickly exposed&quot;, that&#x27;s not a position I took.

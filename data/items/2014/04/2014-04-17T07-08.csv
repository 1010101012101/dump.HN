7602453,comment,7599612,7600536,0,0,mcv,,,"Comparing Backbone and Angular is like comparing apples and dinner.<p>Backbone is a library. You can use it or ignore it, combine it with other stuff, you call Backbone code and use its objects, and it does some limited but well-defined stuff. It&#x27;s easy to combine with other libraries, and you don&#x27;t have to use Backbone&#x27;s feature everywhere if you don&#x27;t want to.<p>Angular, on the other hand, is a framework. It shapes everything you do. It bootstraps your application for you, and calls your code when it needs your input. It imposes a totally different way of working and thinking on you. What it does for you is far bigger than what Backbone does for you. It doesn&#x27;t play nice with libraries that haven&#x27;t been written for use with Angular.<p>Really, the difference is like writing a basic Java program where you write the main() and you call some libraries; and using a webframework that handles tons of stuff for you and you just write the controllers, services and views.",1397721524

7602403,comment,7602282,7602282,14,0,ygra,,,"Incidentally, this was what my diploma thesis was about. The basic idea was to have a single Â»textÂ« that contains lots of possible branching or expansion points, depending on certain criteria. Depending on those criteria you&#x27;d get a expanded or contracted text to read that would be tailored to what you already know or are interested about. Altering the text in small parts (like [âˆ’1Â½] mentioned in another comment â€“ I found that one much later, though) was one part of it; inline expansions if necessary or wanted were a possible UX enhancement I thought of (avoiding a completely static text where you&#x27;d have to tell the engine everything beforehand).<p>Use cases I thought of were mainly adjusting texts explaining things (e.g. Wikipedia, school books, etc.) to the already existing knowledge of the reader. So that an article explaining a concept could look radically different (and going into increasingly more detail) depending on what the reader already knows. One proof of concept I created was adjusting the German Wikipedia article on Turing machines to three different levels (school, 1st semester CS student, 4th semester CS student) [75.3]. What each level does is either explaining things differently or leaving out parts altogether (no need horrifying a pupil with formulae). So my main focus was on providing something that reads well (expanding things inline still incur a context switch because they&#x27;re not part of the original narrative) and finding a way how to model such things. Nothing automatic because a clear semantic model is needed for that to work.<p>Thesis can be found at [0.046], it&#x27;s in German, but the abstract is in English too.

The particular quote does sound iffy - Boltzmann did explain the cooling of coffee via purely classical processes.<p>The basic idea - the particle system moves throughout phase space. The vast majority of phase space consists of areas where thermal equilibrium is reached. If you compute the time it would take for the system to return to a non-equilibrium state, it&#x27;s way larger than the age of the universe.<p>(Note: I&#x27;m not an amateur, though I did leave the field a few years back.)",1397720201

I&#x27;ve become a monster.<p>Secondly, I think that this is entirely wrong.<p>Standard disclaimer: I&#x27;m not a professional cryptographer. I have had to beat my head against ruby and the OpenSSL x509 bindings, so I know enough to probably make some very wrong statements.<p>That being said, the PoC is full of glaring errors. The ctx and cipher objects are created but never used. the Extension Factory is created and then entirely ignored because it&#x27;s only used for the #issuer_certificate method. In addition, x509v3 extensions aren&#x27;t used in any way during this PoC, so it has no reason to be there. And that&#x27;s just the beginning.<p>I went through and picked apart the code in small bits to remove obfuscation and unnecessary actions while preserving the displayed output. Here&#x27;s the massively cleaned up version:<p><pre><code>  #!/usr/bin/env ruby\n  \n  require &#x27;openssl&#x27;\n  \n  key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(2048)\n  puts &quot;Spoof must be in PEM format and saved as ca.pem&quot;\n  raw = File.read &quot;ca.pem&quot;\n  ca_cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new raw\n  \n  puts &quot;before we sign the cert: #{ca_cert.verify(key)}&quot;\n  ca_cert.sign(key, OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.new)\n  puts &quot;after we sign the cert: #{ca_cert.verify(key)}&quot;\n  \n  puts &quot;Hijacked Certificate with chainloaded key saved  @ #{ca_cert.serial}.pem&quot;\n  printf &quot;Verifying Keys Intergity: &quot;\n  puts  ca_cert.verify(key)\n</code></pre>\nThis removes all the variable duplications, doesn&#x27;t write files because they have absolutely no impact on the behavior, and still displays the same output as the given PoC.<p>With a few final modifications it looks like this:<p><pre><code>  #!/usr/bin/env ruby\n  \n  require &#x27;openssl&#x27;\n  \n  key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(2048)\n  ca_cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read(&quot;ca.pem&quot;))\n  \n  puts &quot;before we sign the cert: #{ca_cert.verify(key)}&quot;\n  ca_cert.sign(key, OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.new)\n  puts &quot;after we sign the cert: #{ca_cert.verify(key)}&quot;\n</code></pre>\nSo what we&#x27;ve managed to demonstrate is that you can as a matter of fact sign SSL certificates with a private key.<p>Once again I may have _entirely_ missed the point on this and deleted a subtle line that had a major effect on the code. However with the sheer number of lines that were purely cargo culted for SSL implementations, I really think that this isn&#x27;t an issue. I have an entire history of how I started with the original PoC and how I converted it to the above examples at <a href=""https://github.com/adrienthebo/cve-2014-2734"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adrienthebo/cve-2014-2734</a> ; please check it out if you think I made a mistake in my work.",1397718737

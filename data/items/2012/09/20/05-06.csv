What you really want to know from a survey is a) what the people who feel strongly think about it, i.e. the people who can't be swayed by an ad buy or a newscast, and b) what portion of the population are those people and what portion are the ones who can be easily swayed. But if people are overestimating how strongly they're committed to their answers then they're contaminating both results: The second directly and the first indirectly by inserting the uninformed answers of the disinterested into the sample that ostensibly measures those with strong feelings.",1348120673

Searches on the other hand are intent driven, initiated by users that want to get something done. And I don't think developers of such utility apps want massive downloads, they just want to make a profit.<p>Also your argument about discovery needing top ranking is circular. To get top ranking you first need discovery. This is where iTunes fails its customers - as it focuses on the new and the shinny, creating an environment where apps that build a reputation slowly have no place, which is why most apps in the app store are released in a fire and forget fashion.",1348120507

Information about the behavior of individual users will be of limited use since Google will mostly not be able to associate an iPhone user to a Google account (unless they actively force users of the app to sign in). And even then the such tracking would really need an opt-in feature to avoid being extremely creepy, and for it to be opt-in it'd need to give users a real benefit. On Android they can do it (e.g. Google Now), it's less clear that it's possible on the iPhone.<p>There's some value in the aggregate information from all users in improving the service, but the law of diminishing returns will be reached quickly.

Are we supposed to roll over and shut up because the almighty Gods at Apple decided this was the best way to do? This notion that we should get down on our knees and pray (or otherwise please) the overlords is just wrong-- is it really so crazy to assume that Cook & co. could make a mistake? Yes-- large, publicly traded corporations generally look into many options, accurately predict the outcomes of each, and then make an educated decision that is likely to have the best outcome-- but that doesn't make them infallible. Questioning Apple isn't hubris-- it's human.<p>Tangential: Why do I as a developer have to assume that users don't want what I want? Is it so wrong to think that a user might want to be able to see and evaluate 5 different apps at a time instead of 1? The past couple of years in tech have been spent wondering how to simplify UI for the sake of the user, to the point where we can't even trust them to have settings-- we need to know what's best for them before they log on to our websites or launch our apps, but is that really valid? It's easy to imagine that in 1983 when Microsoft Word was first announced, people needed total simplicity-- these ""personal computer"" things (probably a fad) were brand new and only available to the elite-- but this is the twenty first century and we have a whole generation of digital natives who will ask Google for an answer before they get in the shower-- and they're users too.",1348119483

I guess it's implying I have a non-trivial amount of stupidity, which probably explains my parsing problem.<p>Transit routing is a <i>hard</i> problem to scale - Apple has taken a shortcut and pushed it off to 3rd party developers, who can tackle the much more approachable problem of solving it on a city-by-city basis.  Which make sense... but this is still a <i>large</i> regression as far as users are concerned.  And doesn't help folks that live in smaller cities.<p>Yes, Apple is probably working on this.  But now we come to an odd signalling issue - Apple has basically told 3rd parties that it is worth their time investing in this area.  If-and-when Apple opts to plug this functionality hole, they've pulling the rug out from under these developers.  And any app developer worth his salt has to be factoring that.<p>And I'd be <i>really</i> surprised if Apple steps in any sooner than the next iOS refresh - fixing transit seems like a wonderful bullet point for iOS7.<p>""<i>Loosing iOS users for some barely noticeable amount of switchers is hardly a good business for Google [...]</i>""<p>Err... what are they losing, exactly?

A native version that, again I want to emphasis, Apple is actively competing against their own product.

And this assumes that Apple even <i>lets</i> them release an app.  This wouldn't be the first time Apple has blocked Google from releasing an application on iOS because it duplicates existing 1st party functionality.<p>Basically - <i>why</i> should Google release their own app?<p>""<i>do they even make money from Android phones someone sells? I heard Microsoft makes more money than Google does.</i>""<p>I don't think I can adaquately address this in a response to a comment.

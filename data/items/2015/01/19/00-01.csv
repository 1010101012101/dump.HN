I (and my co.) were just acqui-hired, but prior to that I was in the 5th year of startup hustle, which became infinitely harder with a newborn.<p>The difference is that I appreciate the value of sleep more than I did before.  During a near-acquisition a few years ago I was sleeping 3 hours a night thinking this was the solution to deadlines.<p>For anyone who has lived through that first 6 months or so, you know you never really sleep.  Even if you get 6 hours, it&#x27;s peppered with wakeups, rockings, diaper changes and feedings.<p>Last night I slept about 5 hours and I feel the way I used to feel with 8.  This could be a function of age, but I feel like my body is acclimating to an abbreviated sleep schedule.  This has led me to believe that people who &quot;need&quot; 8 hours of sleep can train their body to need less.<p>That said, if you can sleep, for god&#x27;s sake do it.  Once this kid starts sleeping past 6:15 I&#x27;m going to go nuts on the weekends.",1421629175

CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW does avoid NTP slewing, but NTP doesn&#x27;t just adjust the time scale to adjust for offsets - it also attempts to correct for frequency error in your system clock itself. If you use CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, you don&#x27;t get that correction; you get something that on desktop hardware can easily be tens of ppm off from actual time. Of course, your MONOTONIC_RAW clock is still subject to the vagaries of physics; as temperature or system load changes, depending on the quality of your time source, you might get significant changes in the rate of CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW as well (which NTP will correct for in CLOCK_MONOTONIC, given enough time to adjust).",1421628937

8909687,comment,8907797,8908423,0,0,SEJeff,,,"Ooooohhh a hard one. I better get an upvote for this (joking)!<p>So WRT installation, it is a PITA to install graphite as it follows an antipattern of hardcoding /opt into setup.cfg, which we&#x27;ll be changing in the 0.10 release (to making installing via normal python tools like virtualenv and pip work). That being said, there are really 3 main components to graphite:<p>1. Whisper, the &quot;improved&quot; RRD.\n2. Carbon, the relay and caching daemon that writes out metrics (as whisper by default)\n3. Graphite, which is simply a webui for reading data from carbon and creating graphs, or returning JSON.<p>The only part that is actually interesting is Graphite, whereas carbon and whisper can be though more of as implementation details for when Chris Davis first wrote graphite. There is a large collection of tools that work with carbon&#x27;s super simple text based line protocol. Additionally, there are tons of tools that work with the json or png graph data that graphite-web returns. As an ecosystem, we&#x27;ve made it so that swapping out for a different backend is trivial.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nAlso, I can see logging dictionaries being much more efficient and\n  useful than logging single values -- with graphite if you want to\n  track page hits per section of your site (of which you have 10) per\n  user (100) per browser (5), you end up with 5000 individual metrics,\n  and you need to have thought of them in advance. With influxdb you\n  can log {&quot;section&quot;: &quot;front page&quot;, &quot;user&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;browser&quot;:\n  &quot;firefox&quot;, &quot;hits&quot;: 1} as a single metric and then use an SQL-like\n  query to filter by section / user / browser (or any combination of\n  those) as and when you want to.&quot;[2]\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>This is precisely what statsd is for, if you&#x27;re not familar with it, you really should look into it.<p>Now regarding &quot;influx vs graphite&quot;, I honestly don&#x27;t see influx as a competitor nor will I likely ever see it as a competitor. Sure you can do some aggregations and apply some functions to your data stored in influx, awesome, but Influx can be used as a backend for graphite[1]. So many people don&#x27;t realize that writing a pluggable backend for graphite is pretty simple. For super scalable backends, I&#x27;m somewhat partial to the Cyanite[2] backend which stores metrics in Cassandra, but other people swear by opentsdb + graphite[3].<p>One thing I will say is that the carbon relay is not great software. Around 100k metrics per second even tuned on excellent hardware, twisted (python) falls over and it just eats it. I&#x27;ve been meaning to take a shot at rewriting this in golang, but don&#x27;t have tons and tons of free time to do this on just yet. For a faster relay/aggregator, may I point you to the c version[4] which is super performant.<p>Now for anyone who says that whisper is inefficient because it does tiny writes, perhaps they should understand the software they are attempting to use before deploying it. Whisper is more or less RRD, but allowing backfilling old data. Lots and lots of tiny writes are how the software it replaced worked and how it is meant to work. That being said, there have been several pull requests to batch the writes so that where possible, it has less of an IO penalty. However, you fundamentally need to understand how to troubleshoot a Linux system and tune a system / hardware for the application running on it. I can&#x27;t stress that enough.<p>Regarding other choices, I think quite highly of a drop in graphite-web compatible rewrite in flask named graphite-api[5] from one of our excellent contributors who works for exoscale. Graphite api is interesting in that it is basically just the good parts of graphite-web, namely the functions.py that do all of the transformations. For a dashboard with that, I also suggest you look into grafana[6], which also supports influxdb natively, but again, graphite has a ton more options for transforming the data so they are overlapping, but not competitors.<p>Also please note that unlike Influx or many of the &quot;competitors&quot; of graphite, we&#x27;re a small handful of developers spread out over 2-3 continents who don&#x27;t have a ton of free time. We work on Graphite for fun and try to make things better for the community. There are plenty of good tools != to graphite to use, this is a good thing! #monitoringlove<p>Does this answer most of your questions?<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/vimeo/graphite-influxdb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/vimeo/graphite-influxdb</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/brutasse/graphite-cyanite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/brutasse/graphite-cyanite</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/pyr/cyanite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pyr/cyanite</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/mikebryant/graphite-opentsdb-finder"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mikebryant/graphite-opentsdb-finder</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/brutasse/graphite-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/brutasse/graphite-api</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://grafana.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grafana.org/</a>",1421628205

Virtually all training had been suspended in the final months of the war because the Japanese had no access to oil.

The Japanese made a faulty assumption that they could defend supply lines from the Southern Zone to the Japan.  In many ways, this was the downfall of Japanese naval forces in WWII.

And those assumptions are, I&#x27;d assert, counterproductive to the discussion at hand.<p>The comment I was replying to actually was a real-world example of what you&#x27;re missing, namely that this is a trade-off. Every time you support another 0.0001% of corner cases, you&#x27;re increasing the surface area of potential failures for other cases. And since the other cases are far more common, they&#x27;re going to bite you more often.<p>Supporting the most common cases, to a 99.9% or so level, directly and then having an escape hatch for the rest is not &quot;slapped together&quot; -- it&#x27;s deliberate design which takes the problem and the cost/benefit of different solutions into account. It&#x27;s also, from that perspective, almost certainly the correct design.<p>And yet it gets blasted repeatedly in articles like the OP here, which assume that the only possible reason for such design is ignorance/incompetence on the part of the developer. That simply is not true, and you should stop implicitly buying into that (it&#x27;s another assumption that&#x27;s hidden in the way you write).",1421626760

While, I personally would agree there is an argument that being a helicopter parent does not help build a sense of independence in someone, I&#x27;m really curious if it really is true that a desire of closeness to others in general is really the opposite of that.<p>I guess it makes some sense naively (independence or apartness vs.  dependence or together-ness)? But the way I think about it is that a desire to be independent needs to be tempered with a desire to socialize and be close with others. May be they are orthonormal axes in a person&#x27;s &quot;personality space,&quot; but a healthy balance of both will give a person a good norm overall. This seems opposite of what they hint at toward the end, that these two qualities may not be orthogonal but in fact, anti-parallel.<p>Perhaps Daniel&#x27;s aversion helped him overcome the enormous odds against him, an entire culture that put that &quot;blind&quot; label on him and would have necessarily pulled him far into that the more &quot;dependent&quot; side--I mean, that was the point on the whole rest of the episode. It was needed for him given the extreme pressure he was under from this culture. Still, I hope that for many other people who do not have this extreme desire for independence that they need not be forced into it just so that the rest of us see them as equal. That certainly is not fair for them if they do not desire it.<p>I say all this because while I have a close love for a few close friends and family members, I usually like to be independent myself. However, I&#x27;ve learned as I&#x27;ve gotten older that sometimes you need to rely on others even when you think you won&#x27;t, which isn&#x27;t easy for me. A healthy balance seems better, as I&#x27;ve reluctantly accepted.",1421626493

If you connect to other people&#x27;s WiFi networks or even have your own configured to auto-connect it&#x27;s possible to use devices like the WiFi Pineapple and more to man-in-the-middle (MitM) your connection.  If you aren&#x27;t using a VPN, and lets face it, nobody really does, then a bad guy MitM could inject JavaScript of choice into the HTTP response for major sites, thus using them as a gateway to execute exploit code within the context of your browser.  Many modern exploits don&#x27;t rely on writing to disk and instead remain resident in memory so AV really doesn&#x27;t even save you.

You don&#x27;t want to mess with this by printing billions, at the risk of destroying your reputation (resulting in inflation, and/or speculation against your currency, as others have pointed out).<p>More prosaically, also, every time the SNB prints a swiss franc, that piece of paper is marked as a liability on its balance sheet (and the corresponding euro amount purchased is the asset). So they optically &quot;lose money&quot; if their assets decline in value versus their liabilities, as happened last week. Of course, they could then print more CHF to cover the loss, but then we&#x27;re back to my first point.<p>Finally, and as an aside, the biggest loser in this whole thing was of course the SNB itself, at least on paper. It has CHF liabilities and foreign currency (and gold) assets to the tune of 500bn dollars. On paper then that was a 75bn USD loss. Conversely, and this is worth keeping in mind amidst the frenzy of headlines about broker losses, remember that markets must net off, so all those swiss francs that the SNB sold to defend against appreciation, were held by the market (individuals, brokers, funds, corporates, other governments). Thus it is likely that there are some huge winners out there, whose net wins are greater than the net losses to the tune of about 200bn * 15% (the amount that they intervened in the past 2 years * the percentage move).",1421626370

The point at which Facebook has sufficiently little competition while also annoying its users, it too will be regulated.

8909542,comment,8908645,8908836,0,0,tracker1,,,"There&#x27;s a few minor issues with something like bcrypt, it is computationally expensive for the server as well as the client... if you set things marginally high, it&#x27;s a relatively easy point of not just login attack, but a DDOS attack surface as well.  You could do a shadow hash, that&#x27;s intentionally weak (high chance of conflicts) or even a bitwise composite as an early check to see if a password matches the first check before doing the full bcrypt attempt... you&#x27;ll also need to do a random wait before returning a result that resembles a full server-side check to reduce timing attacks.<p>You can also either move the computation to the client over a secure channel, or have another challenge/response method in place.  I&#x27;ve actually thought about having a bcrypt challenge/response (from a pool of known values at the server) in order to reduce abuse of an API structure or interface.  It was a thought exercise in how to approach such a method better...  It was actually a thought on how to approach something like a next generation hive/bittorrent protocol to reduce the attack surface a bit.<p>In any case, just be careful when you implement more secure hashes with a high compute cost... it can bite you in the ass if you aren&#x27;t careful.",1421625818

Any Perl developer learns these simple facts very early on:<p>- a function can return 0 to many values, depending on what kind of list of arguments you call return() with<p>- the contents of a list depend on the sigils in front of the arguments used in the list constructor<p>- if the sigil is $, then the list will have at the place of that argument exactly one value<p>- if the sigil is @, then list will contain zero to many values at the place of that argument<p>- if the sigil is none, then it&#x27;s a function call, and the list will, following the first factoid, contain zero to many values at the place of the function call<p>- you must do two things with functions when calling them in a list constructor:<p>- 1. manually force them into scalar context in list construction by wrapping the call in scalar()<p>- 2. read the documentation of the function to see if the function makes any promises of its output<p>In the case of the bug you have an assignment to a hash, by way of a list constructor. That list constructor calls the cgi function params(). That function is documented to be able to return multiple values.<p>The programmer in this case didn&#x27;t take care to read the documentation of the function, and this is not remotely the same thing as having a documented bug.<p>To the average Perl developer all this information is known and simple.",1421625616

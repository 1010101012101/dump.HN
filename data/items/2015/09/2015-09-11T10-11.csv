You can apt-get install SDL2, but like most packages it hasn&#x27;t been adapted to the Pi and won&#x27;t work with GLES. So you have to build it from source. And even then I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to stop keyboard input from my SDL window from leaking into the terminal that started the game. And so on... I ended up giving the Pi away.
And that was ~a full year after it came out, I never buy things on launch day.<p>In Xcode, it takes something between 5 and 10 clicks to create a working project for OS X or iOS (with OpenGL or whatever framework you want to use).<p>The developer experience is a big part of what makes the Apple TV what it is. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s perfect - I can&#x27;t believe the App Store doesn&#x27;t allow for time trials yet - but it&#x27;s really, really easy to beat the developer experience for any other living room device.",1441969149

Two things:<p>First, the integrated squads had experienced Marines as well. They selected randomly (within criteria) to have the MOS (Military Occupational Speciality) and experience distribution a typical combat unit would have. That means both junior and senior Marines. That also means that, as combat MOS&#x27;s have not yet been integrated, women will by definition be inexperienced in combat roles. This does <i>not</i> mean the women were inexperienced Marines.<p>Second: This is not an experiment about what&#x27;s fair, it&#x27;s to test what&#x27;s real right now. And when women are integrated into combat roles en masse, this is what that will look like. Women will be less experienced and will be both integrated with, and adversary to, experienced male combatants.<p>This is a test of the <i>current</i> situation--everyone is green once. But that changes. And women <i>will</i> gain significant combat experience. You&#x27;ll see an evolution in training to shore up potential weaknesses and exploit inherent strengths (and they are manifold) that women bring to the table.<p>That said. As it currently stands with women having had less experience, there is the very real potential that those units they are integrated into will experience a s degraded combat capability until training learns to compensate for certain inherent physical and psychological differences between the sexes (not to mention internal cultural hurdles that they inevitably be faced with). Degraded capability means an increased likelihood of casualties in combat. As I said, I believe this will change. I believe in five years this type of test will yield far, far closer results.<p>The question is this: Is that painful (and very likely lethal) initial period worth the ultimate goal of total integration? Is the risk to our servicemen and servicewomen worth that ultimate reward? I believe it is. I was pro-gender integration before I joined the US Army, I was pro-integration during my six years in the Service, and I remain fervently pro-integration years later as a significantly balder and fatter man.<p>It&#x27;s worth it.

I remember very early in the game was a section where you fell <i>just</i> far enough to reverse your fall by rapidly tapping into flight (a very subtle tutorial), and several secret parts where a fall onto spikes could be turned into flight to a secret area.<p>IIRC, you could fly in the flying saucer too, but it was 2 tiles wide so many places could only be reached by flying &quot;unassisted&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s been a very long time since I played that game though!

But I figure you also just have to start <i>doing</i> what you want to do.  This is amazingly possible in the developer world in a way that&#x27;s hard to imagine in any other industry.<p>I was a music major in university (and planning on an English lit or creative writing minor) -- then I took an intro compsci course halfway through, and had a bit of a shock; it was an entirely new thing for me, but I really had a knack for it, and enjoyed it as well.  It was a bit late to change my  major... but I just fit in as much compsci as I could, and also just starting building things outside of coursework.  I managed to get a software dev job right out of college based on a bunch of interactive online drills I wrote for the music department, plus I had very solid communication skills and academic recognition.<p>The software dev job was doing custom dev on lots of different kinds of projects (that was good), and in my spare time I turned the interactive music stuff into a site that&#x27;s still a side income stream.  It&#x27;s languishing somewhat these days, because 5 years ago I started as a developer at a UK-based startup (working remotely from France; long story) and gradually became the CTO -- mostly just from looking for the hardest, riskiest problems we had and chasing them down one at a time, and being easy to work with.<p>It&#x27;s hard to abstract any of this to general advice -- maybe just that mastering anything requires a good deal of focus and just <i>time</i>.  If you want to do technical work (huge range there) you need to be doing it -- making mistakes, finding your way to solutions (good ones and bad), paying close attention to what&#x27;s hard and why.  It&#x27;s probably worthwhile building something other people use, and can look at, etc. -- plus (whatever your focus is), mastering the context of working with customers, colleagues, competitors is valuable.

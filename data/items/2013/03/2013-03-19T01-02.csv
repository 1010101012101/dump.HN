5398460,comment,5397792,5398440,10,0,pcwalton,,,"The built-in pointers with special names call out to functions written in Rust to perform the actual allocation (specifically, the functions annotated with lang=""malloc""/""free""/""exchange_malloc""/""exchange_free""), so you can customize their behavior in that way. Right now we just call through to the C allocator, but there is a WIP GC written in Rust that does some extra bookkeeping in the allocation function and performs the mark and sweep periodically.<p>But the compiler does know about the built-in smart pointers' semantics in order to perform the reference analysis. For custom smart pointers, you usually have to delimit the scope of a reference yourself with a block. For example:<p><pre><code>    let p = ARC(1024); // atomically reference counted
    do p.ref |r: &int| {
        ... do stuff with r ...
        // The compiler ensures that r cannot leave this
        // scope...
    }
</code></pre>
So custom smart pointers cause some rightward drift. Figuring out how to remove this rightward drift is something I would like to solve in the future, but it'll require some more thought. In any case, it's a case of code being a bit uglier, not a case of loss of flexibility, so building a couple of smart pointers into the language seemed like an acceptable worse-is-better solution for Rust 1.0.",1363658359

But is it safe?<p>Surprisingly, the answer from nutrition experts seems to be, Yeah, probably. Jay Mirtallo is a professor of pharmacy at Ohio State and the immediate past president of American Society for Parental Enteral Nutrition, which focuses on the science and practice of providing food to patients through both intravenous injections and feeding tubes. His main concern with Rhineharts plan is that hes making the concoction himself, rather than buying it from reputable suppliers.<p>He basically made medical food, Mirtallo says. If he wanted to switch to a liquid diet, those are already available.<p>Indeed they are. Companies like Abbott Nutrition and NestlHealthScience sell dozens of medical food products.<p>...<p>I asked Mirtallo if I could live a healthy life just drinking medical food from here on out. You can completely, he says. But I dont know why youd want to. There are so many social aspects to food in what we do.<p>One potential downside is cost. Rhinehart claims that he only spends $154.82 a month on Soylent. By contrast, a case of 24 eight-ounce cans of Jevity 1.5cal, a high caloric density product Abbott sells for feeding tube patients, costs $57 from Abbotts Web store. As each can has 355 calories in it, youd need six cans a day to top the 2,000 calorie a day mark used in FDA nutrition data. So a 24-pack would last you about four days. That works out to 7-8 packs a month, which could cost up to $456.</i><p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/14/rob-rhinehart-has-a-crazy-plan-to-let-you-go-without-food-forever-it-just-might-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/14/r...</a>",1363658132

It's all about <i>the degree</i> those proteins get expressed, in what ratios, and (crucially) <i>when</i> that makes an organism. Sort of like if I give you the ingredients to a recipe:<p>bread
cheese
ham
egg<p>You could scramble the egg, put it with the ham and cheese and put it all between bread and have a sandwich. Or you could coat the bread with the egg and throw into a frying pan and make a Monte Cristo. Both sandwiches, but pretty different.<p>As computer types we want to believe that DNA sequence is an analog to computer code. It's not a perfect analogy. There is the currently very hot field of research into epigenetics which is looking into the chemical decorations on DNA that make parts active and inactive at certain points in time. These are heritable, but unlike the sequence, are routinely and intentionally altered by cells in your body (often in response to environmental stimuli). So the environment can make temporary changes that get passed onto offspring, potentially affecting early stages of development. The thing is, development is crucial and not all processes are reversible (e.g. the lens in the eye only gets made once). So what long term effect do these changes have? Nobody has the foggiest idea yet.",1363658089

Companies who handle protected data currently either don't share attack data, or incur legal risks when they do, or incur legal expenses when they have their sharing practices reviewed.<p>CISPA is a straightforward (and short) bill that attempts to remedy that problem.

The typical sentences handed down are by far not the only important thing left out of articles like this. The things missing from these articles could span volumes of books. And each one of them needs to be put into context. If you discuss the typical sentences handed down then they ought to be compared to the sentences handed down for other similar offenses, or to the offenses that have similar typical sentences, and a thorough treatment would go down the rabbit hole into plea bargaining and sentencing guidelines and the whole works. But given limited resources and limited column inches, instead we end up with heuristics like using the maximum penalty as a proxy for the severity with which the law treats the behavior.<p>Whenever there is a popular push to change the law, most people aren't going to understand all the details. People don't have time to learn everything about everything. At some point the layman will have to defer to someone trustworthy (like the EFF or the ACLU) to do the legwork and then adopt their position on the strength of their reputation. <i>They</i> need to get down into the weeds and make sure they understand what's going on, but they aren't the ones getting their information from popular media, they're the ones reading the statutes and the case law and engaging in discussions with scholars and legislators etc. Articles in The New Yorker aren't meant for those people, they're meant for the man in the street who needs to be made aware that something is going on and the people who have done their homework are saying it's a problem and we should do something about it. That way a critical mass of people willing to support doing something about it can be achieved, even if it isn't possible for all of those people to each be individually aware of every nuance of the issue. If someone wants to know more then the information is available. Anyone so inclined can look it up. But most people won't; I don't see any obvious way around that. And an article that skims over some of the details for the sake of brevity and approachability is a lot more likely to be read by those people, so that at least they know that something is happening and maybe some subset of the currently-oblivious can be inspired to learn more.<p>>Not every offense prosecuted under CFAA is a felony; in many cases defendants are charged with a misdemeanor instead.<p>I'm not sure how that changes anything. That some cases are prosecuted as misdemeanors or in an otherwise unproblematic fashion doesn't mean we can't do better in the cases that aren't. And if many of the cases prosecuted as misdemeanors could under the law have been prosecuted as felonies but for the grace of the prosecutor, that still points to a problem in the law.",1363657213

Several of these options (images - which doesn't break Google for me, javascript, cache) are all things that appear on the surface to be very useful in third world countries where bandwidth & hardware is very limited. The ease of finding and configuring these options might be precisely why Firefox has a healthy lead over competing browser in Africa. So while the overall percent of users is 2%, this number possibly shoots up to a majority of the user base when looking at specific regions or demographics.<p>Specifically, image & javascript would help with bandwidth.

That doesn't mean those cores are going to do you any good.<p>Linode is the only VPS I've seen that gives a gross number of cores to everyone. Instead of allocating a cpu count correlated somewhere along side plan-tiering, they just give everyone a lot of CPUs (8), and then they use tiers to determine priority, who gets to actually use those cores.<p>An entry level plan has 1/16th the CPU priority of a top tier user, and pays 1/16th as much and has 1/16th as much ram. If you're not RAM bound, for a somewhat loaded system you'll see slightly better than linear scaling  (since you aren't paying as many context swaps) as you move up in tiers.<p>I think it's a really bad policy to give entry level users scheduling on so many  cores: their workloads will never stick on a local cache! Their jobs are going to be bouncing around the system getting evicted from everywhere and bouncing to the next place where they can trash it's cache next. This is a marketing gimmick, a ""our number is higher"" trick, played on people like you jedbblue!<p>Some time in the past: the Pentium IV netburst core was going to hit 4GHz, then 5GHz. The mhz wars were on, mhz sold, they were what people saw, first and foremost, and it's more the fact that the insanely-deeply-pipelined core didn't even scale that scrapped the idea than people wizening up. I'm not sure if Linode's scheme here is as bad as all that, but it seems unnatural to me, and I certainly would not consider 8 cores to be a boon in this circumstance.<p>Edit- this does change things a good bit! A quote from elsewhere in this thread I was not aware of-<p><pre><code>  We limit the number of Linodes placed on each host 
  machine. We also only place one plan type on each host. In 
  the worst-case scenario, you're splitting CPU time evenly 
  with your fellow Linoders, but are still able to use the 
  full potential of the host if others are idle.

A shirt selling for 1 BTC can sell just as easily for 0.5 BTC.

When huge corporations deny donations to Wikileaks, or when Paypal randomly freezes assets, having a digital currency is not only desirable but a necessity. Those of us that would use BTC for its intended purpose (assuming it isn't just a massive social engineernig hack from Satoshi loloolololo) don't even care if it crashes.<p>That said, I see the price as purely speculative at this point.",1363655272

* Operating systems that run off flash media.

Also, my experience is anecdotal but I do remember my Firefox cache eating up a huge amount of disk space before which prevented me from installing new programs on my OS (until I went and manually cleared the cache).

Advertisers are willing to pay ridiculous amounts for a Groupon deal, so Groupon's sales force has evolved to exploit this extremely lucrative source of revenue. That's just how it works early on.

The power of bad/wrong ideas. I used to approach a problem space by first eliminating all of the obviously bad ideas. Johnson makes a compelling case that invalid facts and invalid ideas juice our creativity. Since reading the book, I've made an effort to at least <i>consider</i> the bad ideas and implementations. More than once there has been a nugget of creativity that I would have otherwise glossed over.<p>2. Liquid networks. I get banged up A LOT (2x - 5x per week) by people who have an idea and want to bounce it off of someone.  I used to view these as a fun distraction and would reward myself with a 1-hour coffee only if I had met my goals for the previous week. If I was behind, these meetings were the first to go. Now, I <i>always</i> make it to these, even if I'm hopelessly behind. The idea is that the more you lift your head out of the sand and participate in a larger network of thought, the more creative you'll be.",1291647296

In many parts of <i>The West</i> it has only very recently been in operation and even democratic ones still have vestiges of monarchy. The first attempts of many countries at overthrowing monarchy in favour of democracy and republicanism resulted in totalitarian regimes.<p>Even the early adopters like the US started more like ancient oligarchy than a modern democracy. White, male landowners only. In some cases with extra powers (via upper houses) to aristocrats.<p>Science is also not western. Neither is medicine. Nor is women's suffrage.<p>Europe has just as much history of monarchy and autocracy as Africa.",1291644476

---
Many of the books you can preview on Google Books are still in copyright, and are displayed with the permission of publishers and authors. You can browse these ""limited preview"" titles just as you would in a bookstore, but you won't be able to see more pages than the copyright holder has made available.
----
So, what if I want to get the full digital copy of these books, what should I do ? Google of course has them. Should I buy somewhere or what ? Then where to buy ? looking at current situation there is no way one can access this. Some books are like so old but still in copyright, out-of-print and only available in Google BOoks. What to do now ?",1291644458

In spite of the fact that I believe that western style democracy does not work all over the world (see the alternative democratic models of singapore and botswana as counter examples), there has to be a clear method to remove people abusing power.<p>I believe the best method that would work in many African countries, particular the decentralised tribes of the Niger-Congo A language group, would be a system of consensus selections of locally organised 'leaders'. One man, one vote does not work for such societies. Rather, the local leaders who are chosen by traditional methods should represent the people who choose them. The western system of senators and delegates results in people who do not represent any group being selected to represent groups.<p>Historical leadership structures in African societies should be adapted to work in a modern concept. Trying to force the european model on non-european societies has caused a lot of trouble all over the world - the illusion that this will ever work should finally be abandoned.",1291644071

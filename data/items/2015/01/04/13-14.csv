8834401,comment,8833728,8833956,0,0,devonkim,,,"The source of funding for a lot of these events in the US is somewhat insidious though. Case in point is Museums On Us is sponsored by Bank of America. Museums oftentimes barely charge anything for admission partly because a lot of their cost expenditures are highly restricted by the grants and agreements of donors they&#x27;ve signed. Museums are visited more than sports stadiums in the US but museum professionals are hardly paid pro athlete salaries. Good example of how museums in general are struggling and desperate is that Fisk Art Museum was motioning to sell off the most prized parts of its collection to private buyers including Georgia O&#x27;Keefe works explicitly donated by her to keep there so that art is accessible to everyone - at a historically black college at that. The grant structured nature of musums has really made it hard for them to operate with modern operating costs, and given universities&#x27; shift toward pro sports for revenue we can&#x27;t sustain most museums. Many are literally one person with 20+ volunteer staff, some of whom were ex-employees that were laid off but just love the collection that much. Other museums are run by descendants of tycoons and will exist basically forever.<p>So do be aware of how you support your local museum. In some cases, I might argue they&#x27;re total losses and we&#x27;d do everyone involved a favor by letting it dissolve. Many museums are glorified corporate or robber baron legacy temples. Museums aren&#x27;t necessarily money-driven either and each one is highly reflective of whom the board has appointed to lead it.<p>I&#x27;m not being anti-corporate, just making it clear that museums can be corporate-run and are highly variable in operations.<p>Disclosure: my wife is a museum collections curation professional",1420379931

Perhaps effective DRM is possible, it&#x27;s just taking a lot of practice.<p>What&#x27;s more, in the past media distribution was on physical disks and players weren&#x27;t on the internet, so software couldn&#x27;t be upgraded. The future is obviously in downloads and streaming, which will enable a bunch of new things.<p>Key rotation will be much simpler as vendors can just issue a compulsory automatic upgrade. As a different download can be prepared for every customer, there&#x27;s no need for keys to be shared by multiple customers. Every download can be watermarked so anything that does get out can be traced to a particular downloader.<p>So I don&#x27;t think the failures of the past indicate it&#x27;s impossible for DRM to ever work.",1420379677

Your timin argument is odd when you consider that they still release movies on DVD with a thoroughly broken DRM system.<p>> The same economics holds for other things like video games. Nobody cares if you beat the DRM on a game that&#x27;s five years old.<p>Yes, they do.  Japanese game companies wanted to make it illegal to sell games to the second user market; MAME rom sites are routinely shut down.<p>Disney initially resisted releasing films on VHS because they would not be able to extract a charge from everyone in the room watching the movie.  Disney uas investigated a bunch of different rights protection mechanisms.  They invented video cassettes that had a ratchet meaning they could only be watched once and needed to be sent back to a factory to be rewound. They invented a DVD that oxidized in contact with air. It would be sent to you in special packaging. You had about 48 hours after opening the package before the disc degrades.<p>Early music players had weird schemes - one digital copy; weird software needed to load music to the device.<p>All of these are about controlling how the consumer uses the product.

8834366,comment,8833772,8834075,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"DVD encryption was the same strength as BluRay, cryptographically. The difference between them are twofold:<p>1) For DVDs there were only a handful of player keys, like less than 30 if I recall correctly. Once they were all leaked the system was broken forever. AACS as used on BluRay has so many keys and such efficient revocation that each player can have its own key.<p>2) The BluRay designers realised that AACS by itself was insufficient because it takes time to revoke a key, and if they leak faster than they can be revoked the total quantity doesn&#x27;t matter much. So they did BD+ as well, which is basically a kind of band-aid to detect emulators using stolen keys.<p>BluRay security has definitely been more effective than DVD security, especially in its earlier days, but the leak of the HDCP master key was pretty fatal, and eventually (all proprietary) emulators got good enough that BD+ programs couldn&#x27;t really tell them apart from legit licensed players.",1420379046

If a DRM scheme is so good that it takes three months to crack once disks hit the street, from the movie studios perspectives that&#x27;s a huge win because during the movie&#x27;s peak people had to cough up the money to buy it or put up with some truly crappy low quality version.<p>The same economics holds for other things like video games.

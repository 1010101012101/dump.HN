629911,comment,629806,629806,0,0,smanek,,,"Deep Blue '97, which beat Kasparov, was a: ""RS/6000 SP Thin P2SC-based system with 30-nodes, with each node containing a 120 MHz P2SC microprocessor for a total of 30, enhanced with 480 special purpose VLSI chess chips."" (from Wikipedia)<p>I'd be interested to know what exactly those VLSI chips contained ... My hunch is that a few dozen modern FPGAs should be able to match a few hundred ASICs from over a decade ago. Then it shouldn't cost more than ~$10K for enough hardware.<p>Hsu could easily bootstrap that sort of machine. Then, after winning a World Computer Chess Championship, he would be in a much better position to issue a challenge to Kasporov.",1243496819

If you say something, then I refute what you're saying, but someone in the audience doesn't hear/understand, then there is value in repeating myself. However, on-line the discussion remains for any interested party to review. Almost always a simple point->counterpoint->rebuttal discussion is sufficient.<p>2.

629890,comment,629011,629011,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"So, I've been an ER nurse for the last 15 years.  I run the Hackers and Founders Silicon Valley meetup, and I love to support startup ideas.  It's extremely rare that I don't support a startup idea or give it a fair shake.<p>This is a <i>spectacularly bad idea</i>.  I can unequivocally say without a doubt that if you pursue this service, someone will die.<p>Why?  Because I've seen it happen.<p>Part of my job as an ER nurse is to triage patients that come in.  Triage involves sorting through the dozens of patients that come in every night, and decide who can wait and who cannot because they have a life threatening emergency.  People having symptoms of a heart attack move to the front of the line.  People who ate a bad taco and have the shits get seen on a space available basis.  That's the gig.  I sort patients:  sort_by_acuity([bad taco, bad taco, bad taco, heart attack, runny nose, cough, gun shot wound, ear infection, headache, headache, headache, stroke, headache]).<p>I've been doing this job for 15 years, and I have seen plenty of triage mistakes that can change people's lives for ever.  I've made a few myself.  You care for thousands of patients a year, you're going to drop a ball every now and then.  But, I have a lot of experience doing this, and I have a lot of knowledge and very good instincts on when someone is very ill.  Patients do not have that knowledge and I would never trust your customers to make that decision when life and death is on the line.<p>This is why ER's are almost universally abysmal at judging how long it's going to take to be seen by the doctor.  The same team that is taking care of your earache at 3am or helping you get stitches after you cut your finger on your computer case, is the same team that can crack your chest open and do open heart massage on you after a thug sticks a knife in your heart.  We take care of bladder infections and dying babies, sometimes right next door to each other at the same time.  ER's are built for safety, not speed or even convenience.  The fact that in the US, they are primarily the only type of physician that can be seen 24/7 without an appointment is an unfortunate effect of our health care system.  But, we have to care for the sickest patients first, and you can never predict when the next ambulance is going to roll through the door.  So, ER's suck at estimating wait times.  But, you will, eventually see a doctor.<p>Now, I understand that you have a disclaimer that says that people should call 911 for Emergencies, and that they will not use your service for life threatening emergencies.  I don't think that's not going to keep you from getting sued when Uncle Bob dies of his massive heart attack that he though was a bad burrito and put his name on your waiting list.  That's also not going to help you sleep at night thinking about how you might have prevented Uncle Bob's death.<p>I'm not trying to flame you.  I'm really not trying to be nasty.  I'm just trying to communicate what a big, big, huge mistake I believe this application is.  Please, shut it down.",1243494855
629889,comment,629040,629040,0,0,keefe,,,"Dude, it sounds like you are really stressed out. Consider the situation you are in (eerily similar to my own, but I haven't left to work on my webapp yet) : lots of job hopping, obvious talent for CS, staring in frustration at being unable to execute a dream, bit of money saved up. I think you need to recognize that you are in a transition period in life and that life is about your emotions and your body as well as your intellect and your wallet. First off, take a yoga class TOMORROW and learn to relax and look at ergonomics info to learn how to avoid neck strain. You're unlikely to make your way out of a desk job if you want a decent life in this day and age. Allow yourself to be completely passive, to attain the beginner's mind and look at the world with no judgement or preconception. You don't need to make a decision now or tomorrow. I think you're burnt out. Relax for a month and do nothing but take things IN don't try to put anything OUT. Rejuvenate and refresh, think about your life. Have a few drinks or whatever turns you on. After a few weeks, take stock and realize you only have so many options ahead of you to make money and live a nice life. Pick the best one, make a plan and then execute on it. Make sure it is realistic and can be pulled off (at least a visible stage 1) in 3 months. If you go back to CS don't be afraid to watch some lectures on academicearth to make sure your bases are sound. Good luck!",1243494725

Do you know how often I carry a weapon? Never. I&#x27;ve never touched a loaded firearm (and I&#x27;ve been in the UK reserve forces for 15 years). I&#x27;ve never seen a firearm in the hands of anyone who isn&#x27;t a trained professional (although if I lived in a rural area I&#x27;d probably see a farmer use one for vermin). I&#x27;ve never seen anyone with a knife bigger than a penknife (which mustn&#x27;t lock) outside a kitchen or workshop, and if I did I&#x27;d call the police because they&#x27;re up to no good.

I know someone in the US whose brother considered taking a gun to the shops in case there was anyone there with a gun. Carrying weapons causes them to be used.

Never.<p>Casual UK knife crime (by which I mean the recent influx of stabbings etc amongst, typically, poor teenagers; not hardened criminals, but idiot, insecure children) is rooted in the unfortunate belief that they need to carry weapons to be safe.",1453053479

That would likely be even more dangerous.<p>There are well-known, and well-understood, automated methods of providing a (mostly) trustworthy source for software installation. RPM+yum on CentOS, deb+apt-get on Debian/Ubuntu. The packages can be signed and verified (so you know you&#x27;re getting what the vendor packaged), the OS-standard sources are open source and easy for third parties to check and used on millions of machines (so you know manipulation is likely to be spotted quickly), easy to verify the versions you have with one command, easy to update to newer versions when security issues arise, easy to verify the files currently installed match (or don&#x27;t) the ones that the package shipped with. And, it is relatively easy to package ones own tools and put them into a local repository, using the same methods to insure safe delivery to all of your systems.<p>I understand using other methods of locally providing packages. And, I understand that sometimes you have to go outside the vendor provided packages (and can&#x27;t build your own, using the same best practices).

Don&#x27;t do that in an automated fashion without explicitly checking out what you&#x27;re being delivered.

This is arbitrary and the choice of the loss depends on the meaning we want to give to prediction errors. Here a big error is penalized way more than a small error.<p>- Are we using the term &#x27;loss function&#x27; as a generalized term? whose special case is &#x27;error function&#x27;? e.g., in linear regression loss function is &#x27;error function&#x27; (MSE like function) but in perceptron, loss function is max(0, -xy)?<p>The way I understand the difference between error and loss is by thinking about regularization methods (where you also add a penalty in the error depending on the parameters of the model). In that case error = loss + regularization. When applying gradient descend you would derivate the error and not the loss.\nThe error is an empirical value that is supposed to estimate the performance of the model on unseen data. This is by consequent not formally defined.<p>- Using final output of perceptron for error function makes it a &quot;hard problem&quot; agreed. But what about using just the function from linear regression (the MSE-like one) instead of a using a brand new function max(0, -xy). (It&#x27;s not very intuitive to reason what&#x27;s so special about max(0, -xy)).<p>The loss function used is a hinge loss.

10920190,comment,10914650,10919618,0,0,klibertp,,,"> Java and other OO languages actually encourage the trend<p>Java, yes. Other OO - not so much. Java is getting better now, but, for a long time, it was simply a weak language, with primitive type system and lots of necessary boilerplates.<p>If you look at other implementations of OO, you&#x27;ll see that the trend of &quot;wrapping everything in dozens of wrappers and other stuff&quot; is definitely not universal among them. Dynamic, reflective languages like Ruby and Python tend to have shallow class hierarchies and few wrappers; especially in Python, heavy use of inheritance and creation of classes for every little bit of data is considered un-pythonic. Then you have Smalltalk, which allows arbitrary code transformations on runtime, which further decreases boilerplate and makes a language more expressive. There&#x27;s also Dylan and, of course, Common Lisp with CLOS. I&#x27;m working with StumpWM lately, a window manager written in Common Lisp - it does use classes and multi-methods, but very sparingly. WM is a piece of software, which is almost GUI only, and so in Java, you&#x27;d get a monstrous framework with myriads of classes and relations between these. In CL you don&#x27;t need that at all - standard defuns and built-in data structures are enough for most things.<p>Anyway, Object Oriented Programming comes in various sizes and shapes, and it&#x27;s unfair to see bad Java code as &quot;representative OO&quot; code. JavaScript is OO, Smalltalk is OO, OCaml is OO(/FP), and Julia is OO. Take a moment (more like a couple of years, but...) to look at them and try to compare the languages&#x27; object models and the common practice of writing code.

Clearly the shortest correct output in the range would be 10^23, but 10^23 is the midpoint between two FP values! Both Grisu and Errol use a fixed size mantissa (64 bits and 106 bits respectively) and have a conservative error margin as a result, and that margin would always contain such midpoints.<p>Errol uses more precise error analysis to show that pathological midpoints are always integral and in the specific range. Since the specific range is <= 2^131, it simply tries to calculate the midpoint as a 128-bit integer and works around the conservative error margin. This removes a major source of pathological inputs, but the conservative error margin still exists and numbers may still fall in that hole.

When I was your age I quit my very secure job at a bank to go on all kinds of weird adventures, working free-lance, going hungry for weeks, suddenly flush with cash from a payment, got my driving license, started to go on ever longer and ever more unplanned trips. In short, I embraced risk in all kinds of ways and found that - to my surprise - the people that tried to hold me back from doing this were wrong. Tomorrow <i>always</i> took care of itself somehow, as long as you have skills you&#x27;ll have a place somewhere and some food in your stomach and every time you move to a new viewpoint you become slightly richer (but maybe not in a material sense, but that&#x27;s fine until that need arrives).<p>Finally, when I was 27 and my first child arrived that phase ended, then it very much mattered if there was money on the table and life suddenly changed from being relatively free to being quite structured with a very high penalty on any inability to provide. I made a pretty conscious decision to stop following just what interested me but to chase the buck and with the knowledge gained in the preceding years that was quite easy.<p>Go see the world while the current phase lasts, sooner or later life will <i>really</i> trap you (compared to your situation atm) and then you&#x27;re on the hook for many years before you will have some of this freedom back again. By then your body will be one that you can&#x27;t compare to today (and I&#x27;m saying that as a reasonably fit person of 50+), your time will be spoken for at some regular interval and so on.<p>The right time to strike out into the world is now, don&#x27;t worry overly about how you&#x27;ll finance any or all of this, a few hundred in savings would be enough to broaden your horizon tremendously and that alone will give you an advantage over those that are rooted to their hometown.<p>This, by the way is what fuels my &#x27;journeyman&#x27; projects that I try to do each year now, they&#x27;re a link back to my past, basically not a new thing but a continuation. It&#x27;s been incredibly rewarding to meet all these new people and to help them to achieve their dreams and contribute a little bit to solving their problems even if not a single cent ever changed hands. I very much look forward to doing another round of these this coming summer.",1453051512

In principle, one could simulate proteins and extract this kind of information, but it&#x27;s not computationally accessible.<p>Folding the protein is only one part of it.  This part, while not &quot;solved&quot;, has seen an enormous amount of progress in the past few years, such that we can often predict the coarse-grained 3D structure of a protein, although not the fine details in most cases.<p>Understanding the enzymatic action of proteins typically requires simulating chemistry at the quantum (bonds breaking and forming) level around the active site.<p>Since biologists are more interested in getting results quickly, rather than solving the fundamentally hard problems (the former gets grant money more easily), and because structures that are similar tend to have similar functions, they tend to use structural homology- similarity to a protein of known function- to infer the function of a protein.<p>Although much of my prior work was designed to address the forward prediction problem, I have acknowledged that shortcuts produce more valuable data.  And often times, that does involve finding a gene whose protein product behavior is cryptic, and then using structural homology, and other indirect methods, to refine the function of the protein.<p>As for the &quot;computer science terms&quot;, I can mention that after working with large distributed systems for a long time, I treat debugging them a lot more like how biologists deal with cryptic proteins than trying to understand them from first principles.  I often run &quot;experiments&quot; by injecting things into the distributed systemns, and monitoring them, much like scientists monitor proteins using fluorescence.",1453050092

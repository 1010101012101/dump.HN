When I read this I definitely do not see what you see. Here, I'll break down what I see when I read this:<p>He begins by saying that 'interchangeable' is most important element to determining prior art: ""more importantly, it had to be interchangeable"". Then he moves on to explain that ""the key [to determining if something is interchangeable] was that the hardware was different ... and more modern software could not be loaded ... and run without error."" In other words, if the code doesn't run on the old hardware, then it's not interchangeable and therefore not prior art.<p>Then, in one of the paragraphs that you brought in, he indicates that he's summarizing and repeat (""the 40,000 foot-level""). He says that the ""methodology"" was different. Here he uses ""method"" or ""methodology"" to mean code. You can see this in this quote from elsewhere in the interview: ""when we looked at the source code - I was able to read source code - I showed the jurors that the two methods in software were not the same"" and this one: ""you couldn't load the new software methodology in the old system and expect that it was going to work"". So again, he's saying that if you can't load the new code on the old machine, you don't have prior art.<p>It appears to me, from your quote and from the article, that he believes that running new code on an old device is ""the key"" to determining prior art.

4459398,comment,4410933,4410933,1,0,sebg,,,"The website looks nice and well designed.  I like the idea and problem you are solving though worry how you actually get it into people's hands.<p>Some website specific thoughts:
1. When I think of retirement, the words that I want are more emotional than ""easy"" - they are ""secure, wealthy, long, happy, etc"".  While it is true that retirement planning is a bit difficult, it really is as easy as paying someone else to worry about it (the 1.5% of assets you quote).<p>2. Provide some spacing between vertical elements to give them some room to breath.  As the website is very text heavy, the missing space makes the whole front page look even more jam packed.<p>3. As you have 2 green buttons, the red ""made in canada"" banner really stuck out to me as I squinted on the first page.  In fact, when I landed on your page it was the first thing I saw.  Note - there is nothing wrong with being proud of where you are from or where you made the page, what is wrong with this is two things (a) it's the first thing I noticed on your web page and (b) I am in the US.  Which immediately made me think that perhaps your website wouldn't work for me.  While this may or may not be true, it's the first thought that went through my head.<p>3. The testimonial is in a font and color that was hard for me to read.  Also, pushing it so fast on me made me feel like you were trying to sell me on the service too fast.  First - tell me what it is that you do and why it's awesome.  If I don't leave, then as I scroll down the page give me some indication that it's actually real and that other people think it's awesome.<p>4. In the header bar, perhaps change ""Tour"" to ""Benefits""?  Sell me the sizzle not the steak.<p>5. The green button with the ""or xxxxxx or xxxxx"" is confusing and gives me too many choices.  Have a very strong thing about what the best user flow should be and stick to that.  Especially since you link the ""or "" links on the nav bar as well.  If I really really really want to find those, they are at the top of the page.  The main hero action should be directed towards making a super convincing argument that has only one answer ""yes i'd like to learn more"".<p>6. In the three text heavy boxes, you are telling me stuff that while nice, I'm not sure actually add anything.  If you are telling me it's easy on one hand and then expecting me to know what monte carlo simulations are, it's a bit confusing.  If you are selling it on ease, the headings should be more about how it's worry free.  Basically let us worry for you.<p>7. The 1-4 steps at the bottom seem like a very long list of things for me to do before I get any value from your website.  Perhaps it's better to focus on one of those things?  Start by doing one really well and then slowly grow over time into the other ones.  Otherwise, it's hard to really nail each of the different pieces.<p>Final thoughts:
I like what you are doing and think it could definitely help.  Perhaps a mix of smartasset.com and readyforzero.com so that I can tell you all my financial info, tell you when I want to retire, and how much i want to have and you tell me exactly what that takes and how to do it.  Then you upsell me on viewing my portfolio later.<p>Great work and looking forward to seeing how this works!",1346417176

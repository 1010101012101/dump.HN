The notion of correctness, that there are a set of core properties for a language that are always true, is appealing to me.  It's one of the things I like about Haskell[0].

Only they intelligently manipulated my shareholder agreement in a way that I had to actually buy the options, no paper transfer, I needed cold, hard cash. Having very little money at the time (being between jobs) I was unable to do so, which meant that I forfeited my options. Probably for the best anyway, because buying them didn't guarantee a buyout, only the <i>option</i> of one. I would have been out $5000, just waiting for the day to be bought out, which would probably never come.<p>Lesson learned: read things very carefully, confusing language is intended to be confusing. I basically gave away two years of my career to kool-aid equity. Just be really careful, and if you don't fully understand something ask someone who does understand.

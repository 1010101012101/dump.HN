3622016,comment,3621778,3621778,48,0,tptacek,,,"A fair bit of discussion here, perhaps much of which misses the point:<p>A resume has just two purposes: first, to help you get an interview, and second, to get you past an HR hurdle.<p>It is not the job of your resume to go further than those objectives. In particular: it is not the job of your resume to establish a valuation for yourself. No one document can do that; in fact, no <i>document</i> can: you have to do it yourself, preferably face-to-face, by understanding in each interview what the ""buttons"" are, what the language of benefits that company speaks is, what things they find important, and how your prior experience can be phrased in ways that push those buttons and communicate those values.<p>More importantly: resumes, in any form, are <i>bad</i> at getting you interviews. A resume comes into play at the earliest part of the recruiting funnel, when the hiring team has the smallest number of cycles to spend on each candidate. Your primary strategy for dealing with recruiting funnels: <i>jump the fucking line</i>. It's never been easier to do this! Ten years ago, you'd have to track down someone who worked with someone who worked for someone at the same company as the hiring team. Today, in tech, you just go search Github for projects your hiring team contributes to and start sending pull requests.<p>Keep your resume simple. If Github does it for you, gets you in the door, great.<p>People spend a lot of time thinking about resumes. It's easy to see why. Resumes are the key ego document everyone in our field gets to work with. They are, admit it, fun to tinker with. That's fine. But don't obsess. The resume is literally the least important part of the search for your next role.",1329937128

But, if fragments of the page are being replaced as bcx does, then you need to do similar coding anyhow.</i><p>It should not be similar. There is a huge architectural difference between the two approaches. In server-side approach you're adding caching or prefetch to an already working application that has established and working URLs. With client-side approach, you need to implement adapters that transform URL information into the client state that is normally achieved by a series of UI operations and AJAX calls. Then you need to add new code to generate URLs and manipulate history.<p>The beauty of caching or partial page fetches is that they are generic. History manipulation is not.<p><i>js works pretty well on modest smartphones, at which level network latency is usually the major concern...</i><p>The last time I tried to browse on Kindle, it choked and died on most JS heavy websites.

If not, how does keeping the Player closed source help your business interests?<p>Is it the client side DRM you have in place in the Player that's stopping you from making it open source?<p>Do you not have the resources to communicate with the community that would develop around an open sourced player (knowing that you would have spend some time to justify many things that exist in the codebase to maintain backwards compatibility)?<p>Are you concerned that a rival would clone some of the technology you developed and implement it in their proprietary player (e.g. MS, but they already gave up on Silverlight)?<p>Would the sudden influx of new security patches as vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed potentially compromise the performance of the Player?<p>Are you worried that individuals with malicious intent will find new vulnerabilities and exploit them?<p>What are your  other concerns that are preventing you from open sourcing the Flash Player?",1329936415

It stands for benefit corporation, and basically it is a legal designation when a company organizes to have a social mission (things like environmental impact, community involvement, etc.) as part of their fiduciary duty.  The result is that a B-Corp can be legally held to its social mission.<p>Relating back to your question, looking for a B-Corp can be helpful for someone looking at the ethics of a business model because a B-Corp is required to have a third party certify that they are actually pursuing their original social mission.<p>If you are evaluating companies in SV, California is one of the states that allow B-Corps, so you should check with the company.

I found this out a decade ago when I could legally drink and would experiment with various spirits and liqueur. Since budget was limited, each of us in a group has a limited number of shots, and I used to feel awkward when my friends used to talk about ""that dizzy feeling"" and I did not experience any. It was only later that I found out what was going on.<p>This also means my options to reach the ""state of bliss"" is limited, and the cheapest way for me to reach that state is meditation.<p>I am not sure if both symptoms are related, but someone who follows this more closely can perhaps comment.",1329935154

That's a great market, but it's a completely different market than the one Tesla is going after.<p>The Roadster is basically an electric Lotus.  And there's no-one that's going to say to themselves, ""You know what would make good financial sense?  Replacing my Civic with a goddamn electric race car.""  It's not about price or energy or the planet, it's about something unique and fun, a luxury good.  I expect that there is close to zero overlap between potential Tesla Roadster and potential Leaf buyers.<p>The Model S changes the dynamic a bit, but it's still not competing with the Leaf and other city cars.  And most importantly, it will appeal to people (like me) who love cars.  It's unsual, but extends beyond sports-car novelty into something that could easily be the primary vehicle for a family of 4 - or even more with the rear-facing 3rd row seat.

This was annoying and frustrating to try to learn with even for simple errors. But it was <i>ridiculous</i> when the error was a single character change within three lines packed with newly introduced notation. The minimal correct way to handle this would have been simply to overlay a YouTube annotation over the incorrect text. Those would have shown up in full screen mode, and they wouldn't have required students to simultaneously mentally amend what they were watching while juggling new concepts in their heads.<p>I was also not thrilled when newly introduced terminology got thrown around imprecisely in some of the videos, leaving the viewer wondering what these terms actually mean, and what the teacher was actually trying to say.<p>I have no doubt that Thrun and Norvig are great computer scientists.

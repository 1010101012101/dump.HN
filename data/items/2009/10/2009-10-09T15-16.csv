871668,comment,870921,871600,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Here is my take on that, but it is skewed because of location (EU):<p>Poland and several other countries in the former east block are still extremely anxious about being on Russias doorstep, and the Americans figured that now was the time to get a foothold there in case there would ever be a 'revival'. Playing in to the fear they promised a shield from anything bad that Russia might be able to do, ostensibly because of the so called rogue states.<p>But I really don't see N. Korea or Iran attacking Europe, if Iran will do something it will more than likely be against Israel, and if North Korea will do something I'd expect it to be against Japan or South Korea, and most likely conventional against SK, Japan I'm not so sure.<p>So the threat is magnified for political purposes and to get a foot on the ground right where it kicks the Russians in the teeth. And of course the Russians never played along and named it for what it was.<p>NATO has some serious firepower in Europe already, but hardly any of it near the old Russian borders and using a popular fiction (that Iran and North Korea are a threat to western Europe) they tried to get their way.<p>Obama figures it is simply going to cost a bunch of money, increase the tension so better to let it go.<p>Smart move on his part.",1255103989

It seems overcomplex, but we need to try <i>something</i> to evolve the site and ease its growing pains.<p><i>Maybe HN has the advantage of being connected to YCombinator, and thus has a reduced risk of this happening, but the risk is still there.</i><p>It's already happened. Even in tech discussions, we've got a whole shitload of snark even when it comes to mild topics. Topics with even a little drama, like the 37signals discussion over accepting VC, lead to people acting like high schoolers. I'm 19, and I read some of the comments people're leaving here, and I want to tell them to grow up. That's a really, really, <i>really</i> bad sign for a community, when adults are acting like n00bs.<p>When it comes to off-topic stuff, I realize each and every time that the majority of people here <i>don't know what the hell they're saying</i>. When people start talking about relationships, or drug use, or politics, whatever, most comments are inane and wrong. Look at the Nobel conversation right now. People are going <i>nuts</i> and dissing the committee at every chance they can get, calling it a disgrace, etc., because apparently they've never looked at the Nobel prize before. They're also assuming that the gut reactions of people hours after an announcement determine how a political game is going to be played. It's frighteningly immature, assuming these people are all allowed to vote based on their shallow opinions.<p>Every week I grow more and more disgusted with this community. I stick around because the few dozen voices that are smart are really worth having discussions with, and I love still being able to discuss certain topics and learn from people who know more than I do, but I'm starting to agree with the general rest-of-the-Internet consensus that people here have their heads stuck deep up their asses. Every time I defend this place somewhere I realize I don't believe what I'm saying. I'd like to fix that, because there are precious few places left to jump from here.",1255103983

871662,comment,871158,871158,0,0,bad_user,,,"I once did a crawler that searched the content of a couple of large websites for phone numbers.<p>I did this daemon in Perl, using fork() to search multiple websites in parallel. When a new search was initiated, the daemon broke the search in multiple packages (of 5000 items to be searched). After initiating 5000 searches (keeping the maximum number of active processes at 30), I did a wait for all the children to finish, so that I can mark the package as ""done"".<p>The trouble with fork is that opened sockets are sometimes not forked very well. And I forked my database connection (a DBD::Pg). Forking a DBD::Pg connection went well in my tests, but once in a few thousand forked processes, a process would stall. Sometimes it recovered after a few hours, sometimes it didn't.<p>I tried setting an ALARM that would make the process auto-kill itself after some time. Didn't work. The final workaround was to monitor the child processes from the parent, and kill -9 the ones that hanged. But the whole processing became too slow.<p>Finally I gave up on the idea of packages and on marking the search as ""done"". So I just marked the search as ""done"" after the last child was forked.<p>It was a difficult bug because the client had no idea it was a bug, and waited patiently for the results (sometimes as much as 2 days). It was also difficult because at first I had no idea why my processes hanged.",1255103736

The way the supervisor works is it sends a ping packet to the machine, and if the machine responds it is deemed to be up. But chopper misses one ping out of every 5 or so, and sometimes several in a row.<p>We swap out the computer, move the scsi drive to another box and boot it. Chopper registers as off-line, but works just fine.<p>More confusion, finally, out of desperation we start messing with the network. This is all 10Base T, coaxial cables with little T connectors on the machines and a terminator at the end of the line on the last 'T' to make sure the impedance is right.<p>The terminator was on, so that wasn't it.<p>We went for a break at that point, we'd been at it for hours. Finally, by elimination we figure the <i>only</i> things we haven't changed yet are the drive and the 'T' connector, but surely that can't be it.<p>And it was... somehow that T connector was a pretty good filter for some bits in the incoming or outgoing ping packet
 changing one of the bits, causing the IP checksum to fail. No returned ping... we replaced it back and forth 3 more times just to make sure we weren't seeing things.",1255103381

This caused the accelerator controller to floor it because it was only seeing the last CAN message we ever got which happened to be zero velocity. Same thing with the steering (hence the big swerve).<p>or<p>(b) I failed to consider the contingency of not getting any CAN interrupts (either because the of the [very intermittent] hardware bug or because the connector got disconnected--turns out the symptoms are the same) and didn't have any code written to deal with it.

I don't mean to be insulting, but nothing you describe happens or has happened in any Mac OS:<p>1. Mac <i>apps</i> don't have toolbars (save the odd cross-platform exception). App <i>windows</i> can have toolbars, but they remain with the window, so it's impossible for you to close a window and still work with its toolbar as you describe. Likewise:<p>2. ""The Macintosh Operating systems have always operated under the assumption of single app focus reconfiguring the toolbar"" can't be true, because there aren't any. The only thing that changes from app to app is the menubar, and floating palettes if there are any. They of course, disappear, so:<p>3. ""with clutter from unfocused apps taking up the visual space."" can't be true either. When an app's in the background, only its document or other main windows remain -- and you've already conceded it's important that they be there. All floating palettes and other ""clutter"" disappears (so you certainly can't be confused that it's the active app and try to use its invisible toolbars, either). If the main windows disappeared too, how would you support drag-and-drop etc?<p>4. ""But my OS isn't trying to reconfigure itself to support whatever app happens to be in focus at the moment."" ... and neither is Mac OS. There's <i>no reconfiguration going on</i>. The menubar titles change to accord with the active application, and ancillary palettes -- windows that only make sense when their application is active -- disappear. That's all that happens when an app focus changes.<p>4b. Which makes ""and got supremely frustrated that I couldn't bring that app in focus"" bizarre. You clicked on an app's window and it didn't come into focus? Why not?<p>5. ""The disassociation of tools (methods) from the thing that you are working on (objects) is not only a poor abstraction, it's a usability nightmare."" ... well, except that this is how we've worked every since our ancestors got tools? The hammer doesn't stick to the nail, or the saw to the piece of wood. Tools <i>aren't</i> associated with the things they're working on.<p>6. ... well, except in computing, where they <i>are</i> associated, necessarily. If you're working on an image, you're in an image editing app, and the appropriate tools need to be available. When you switch to a text document, they need to go away (as they do on the Mac), and document-editing tools need to be available.<p>7. All of this adds up to make your toolchest metaphor totally nonsensical. In what way and by what behaviours does Apple's metaphor mix up the buttons from your calculator with the pedals from your car? The only way I can make sense of it is to think that because the calculator is still visible on the screen while you're in another app, you're somehow confused about what you're doing. It's as if you want the OS to only allow you to do one thing at a time.<p>8. Which would be the full-screen thing. Except that breaks the metaphor again. It's a desktop. You're allowed to have more than one thing on it at a time. You don't push everything off your desk and only have one piece of paper allowed on it at any one time, do you? So why should your computer behave the same way? Especially if you've got a 24"" or 30"" screen. But, even then, you can just ""hide others"" and hide the dock, and your window can fill the screen with no other nasty apps insulting your field of view.<p>I'm sorry if we've got here from what you meant to be a throwaway line about the ""multi-window aspect"" of Macs, but really, unless you're making an argument for having nothing but old-school Windows MDI, it was a daft position to take, unless you've got a huge misconception about how Mac OS window handling works. It's certainly not ""almost unusable"" because it lets you see other windows -- and you've already conceded it's important to be able to see them, so I'm struggling to get where the ""madness"" you talk about comes in.",1255101427

My network speed is pretty good but I'm only comparing it to an EDGE connection on my work BB.<p>The donut release isn't bad.  Good performance boost (I wouldn't classify mine as 'huge' but we might use our phones a lot differently).  Battery life about the same for me. (I still have a battery charging level issue leftover the from the cupcake upgrade.)  I don't know if there were any browser updates in donut but Google Wave on my G1 is very slow to load. (1-2 minutes even on wifi.)
I was mostly comparing the cupcake upgrade to the donut upgrade.  There was a huge visible difference between them.<p>All in all, I love my G1.  Way better than my work issued BB.  I'm just wanting more.  ;-)",1255100910

I lived in a small New England town that did their own power, much like most towns do their own water and sewer.<p>My job was as an assistant to the inventory guy, a 70 year old feisty man with one hand named Al.<p>I was often bored when Al would tell me to 'go hide somewhere' so I wrote some software to help him manage the inventory system.  The power engineers in charge saw this and after a few small programming assignments had me work on updating the newly installed SCADA control system.  This was a specialized programming environment that controlled all the power in the town.<p>We were setting it up to buy power from the local college during the yearly 'peaks' in August, thus reducing our yearly electrical bill by potentially millions of dollars.<p>After a month of working on it and incrementally adding my changes I screwed up.  I knew this when I submitted a change and all the alarms went off at the substation.<p>Half the towns power was out.  I got it back on after an hour, and nobody called with ventilator issues, so I think there was no real harm done.<p>The engineer in charge of the department laughed it off when he saw my apprehension about the situation.  He said in the grand scheme of things they have made far bigger mistakes than that, probably referring to the blown transformer a couple months earlier.",1255100832

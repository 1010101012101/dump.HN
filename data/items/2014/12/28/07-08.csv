High-profile results that have a simple enough procedure so they can be combined.<p>As such, it can&#x27;t get even close to support what they&#x27;re (whoever -they- actually is, it may not be the actual researchers) trying to claim. What about less high-profile stuff? What about more complex setups? If 20% of your most rock-solid results are not reproducible, I wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to celebrate.

You can choose an potential employee to train who may not &#x27;just get it&#x27; for a cost far higher than hiring the experienced guy would cost.  It&#x27;s like building a house with cost overruns that your construction loan won&#x27;t cover anymore and you cant get any more money.  You end with a huge useless debt that YOU have to pay now and a useless half-finished house that most people don&#x27;t want to buy.<p>Also when you train employees, you get these retention contracts that can create a perverse incentive for and employee to take advantage of or a deal as an employee that you wouldn&#x27;t want to take, because you&#x27;d have to pay for a training cost subject to the whims of an employer firing you.",1419753515

It is part academic study and part compulsively watchable television.<p>The single best anecdote among many is how the statute of the Colonel, which is outside every KFC in Japan, came to become associated with the brand here.  Apparently when the guy in charge of KFC Japan was put in charge of the unit, HQ didn&#x27;t really think a poor Asian country merited any marketing support, but they let him use anything they had in storage.  Somebody had produced several hundred Colonel statues but they were deemed too ridiculous to use.  &quot;So I said &#x27;I&#x27;ll take all of them.&#x27;&quot;  &quot;And did you know they would be a hit with Japanese people?&quot;  &quot;No clue, but something is better than nothing.&quot;<p>(Also worth mentioning: the guy&#x27;s right hand man, who was Japanese, gets into an argument with him over whether selling KFC as &quot;aristocratic American elegance&quot; to Japanese people is exploitative, since, quote the American executive, &quot;We sell fried chicken to poor people.&quot;  &quot;Maybe you do over there, but we won&#x27;t over here.&quot;  Topics in the discussion included cultural appropriation, memories of the war and associated famines, and the desire of an emerging economic superpower to consume things associated with wealth, like meat.)<p>The easiest way to find the video is probably your local library or university library, as it was made in the early 1980s.",1419753487

Not more warfare or tough justice.<p>I&#x27;d even take this position beyond the war on drugs and apply it to the war on terrorism as well. As we saw in Afghanistan, what good was spending trillions on war when we leave them with a non-existent economy or infrastructure? The only massive industry there is now opium and funds are going straight to the adversary.<p>Same with the American drug war. Thousands of impoverished kids with their fathers dead or in jail on drug charges, no long-term career possibilities except an extremely accessible job market built on violence.<p>I&#x27;m not promoting pacifism, security is essential. But social/market liberalism, combined with creating economic support infrastructure, and investing in a strong legal systems against corruption (so it doesnt end up like Africa).<p>The only way practical justification for more war/justice is via some emotional gratification of getting &#x27;revenge&#x27; on some unsavory class of people in society by the controlling class. Because how could the goal really be to minimize or stop the problem when the failures of that strategy are so obvious to anyone who spends a moment critically analyzing the history of it?",1419753451

8805687,comment,8804934,8805654,0,0,morgante,,,"There are two major problems with listing salaries publicly.<p>1. We don&#x27;t really want to make the huge salary discrepancies obvious to our non-tech employees. While it&#x27;s theoretically true, publicly listing the difference wouldn&#x27;t be great for morale.<p>2. There&#x27;s a huge range, and where a particularly candidate falls in that range requires qualitative judgement. We consider everyone from talented new grads to senior developers with over a decade of experience, but the expected salary range can swing by as much as $100k—publicly listing such a big range isn&#x27;t helpful for anyone. (Yes, I understand that we could theoretically have different job listings but our criteria are driven more by &quot;how much smart shit can you get done&quot; and &quot;how much will you learn&quot; than by years of experience or anything quantifiable on a careers page.)<p>> Note that it&#x27;s pretty strange to claim that you can&#x27;t attract enough skilled engineers even at higher salaries when you&#x27;re keeping the fact that you pay higher salaries a secret. How do you expect this mechanism to work?<p>It&#x27;s not that I think an unadvertised salary will by itself attract skilled engineers—I&#x27;m just using our experience as a counterfactual for the claim that there are loads of senior developers but we aren&#x27;t willing to pay them enough.

While coding, he used an audio screen reader. If you&#x27;ve ever heard one, you know that they can be set to read incredibly fast, such that it sounds like absolute gibberish to the untrained ear.<p>So, whereas I couldn&#x27;t even discern the words/characters being read, it made absolute sense to him. Much as I was amazed by it, I also know that he didn&#x27;t start there. Years of practice, finding shortcuts, etc. made it as much second nature to him as reading code on the monitor was for me.<p>Of course, it also didn&#x27;t hurt that he was brilliant.",1419752753
8805674,comment,8804934,8805120,0,0,mahyarm,,,"A big part of it is timezones and language barriers.  Unfortunately in tech, the big hiring pools of engineers are:<p>1. USA<p>2. Eastern Europe<p>3. India<p>4. China<p>5. Western Europe (Much smaller than the above)<p>And in this situation, usually the main office is in the USA, and sometimes the main office is in Europe.  And then you have to synchronize with teams across very separate timezones.  5 minutes becomes 1 day and it become very frustrating.<p>Then on top of that, you have to deal with the culture and language differences that can make communications very difficult.  You quickly start noticing people will organize into native-language social cliques very quickly and that can be a hard problem to manage.  You can get to the point that you say you will fire them if they don&#x27;t start communicating with other people in the company other than people in their native language.<p>Eventually with these remote workers, because of all of this separation, you&#x27;ll want to eventually bring them into the main office.  Then you have entire other suite of problems to deal with, since immigration authorities usually require you to go through a visa song and dance bring these guys temporarily into the main office that is pretty close to just importing them permanently into the main office anyway.<p>So to deal with this entire problem, they say screw it and try to import them into one time zone / black hole called the main office.  Immigrating into one country starts creating a melting pot effect where their language skills improve, they integrate with the local culture and language of the main office better and you don&#x27;t have timezone differences to deal with.<p>So you say, why not say remote workers but they have to be in the USA only?  And there are many that do say that!  Unfortunately, latin america just doesn&#x27;t make a lot of software engineers, and you get laws like &#x27;hire 10 mexicans for every foreign worker in your company&#x27; that prevent you from establishing an office in the same timezone at a place with freeform immigration policies, because it probably doesn&#x27;t exist.",1419752742

8805672,comment,8802414,8803900,0,0,akiselev,,,"There are a few major electronics parts markets in Shenzhen, primarily Huaqiangbei and Luohu Commercial City (I&#x27;ve never been, I just hire someone with EE experience to do it for me). Most of the big name IC manufacturers&#x27; parts can be found between those two. When you are manufacturing anything in large quantities, part reliability (a better word would be authenticity) and availability are major concerns that are usually dealt with by someone upstream with experience in supply chains. When negotiating contracts I am always up front about how and where all of the major components will be sourced depending on a variety of factors.<p>For example, if there is a tight deadline (e.g. designing part of a motherboard based on a new chipset where time to market is critical) then the first few revisions will be made up of parts sourced mostly from Shenzhen. If it&#x27;s a niche contract (like defense/aerospace) then it depends on how fast I get the primary parts (e.g. rad hardened processors take a minimum of 3 months lead time so all parts are from manufacturers starting from the first revision). However, unless there is an extreme deadline or a manufacturer I loath dealing with (cough Marvell cough) the final boards sent to the client are made with manufacturer sourced parts, for which I have to start the procurement process the second I get the contract.",1419752587

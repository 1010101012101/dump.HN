If I already have a career in the suburbs and a family, how do I emulate this environment?<p>That's the general case, which might be the easier one to address.  In my specific case, I have a career in the suburbs, and I'm about to get married and probably start a family. How do I go about finding/creating a more stimulating environment? What do I look for in recognizing the highly stimulating environments?  I feel like I'm in a medium environment now, and outside of the suboptimal online contact, it seems to be moving in the wrong direction.",1230926335

It is striking to watch people engage in this level of intellectual onanism.<p>I dont mind people making arguments that are reasoned and carefully successively built. But to just start with one opinion, pretend it is a fact, and then build another assertion on top of that is a bit much. I do not believe that you have to have a degree in economics to opine about economics, but whatever your arguments are, at least make them as arguments as opposed to ""I am smart so everything I say must be true"" style pronouncements.",1230926215

417609,comment,417542,417542,0,0,mixmax,,,"Public economic policy is a hard problem, and with all Respect to Philip there are a couple of points from the list of promises to business managers that are somewhat contradictory.<p>1) <i>world's lowest percentage of GDP (among developed nations) spent on government; only with a low spend will investors have faith that taxes will stay low </i> - This has the consequence of bad infrastructure, an uneducated workforce, less investment in  basic sciense which lays the ground for innovation and high-tech industries, etc. A country like Sweden has a high percentage of GDP spent on government, and yet it has managed to create companies such as Saab, Ikea, Ericsson, Electrolux, Hasselblad, Hennez and Maurtitz, Mysql, Volvo, etc.<p>2) <i>corporate governance that relieves investors from worry that profits will be siphoned off by management </i> - This is one of those things that sound easy but turn out to be extremely hard. History shows that when you try to protect investors from fraud, mismanagement, etc. all you get is more red tape and, bigger government and make things harder for small companies. Sarbannes Oxley (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes-Oxley_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes-Oxley_Act</a>) was an attempt to solve this very problem and it turned out to be a disaster.<p>3) <i>world's best school system and best educated workers </i> - America has a long way to go here. The problem is that it takes many years to get educated workers: You start in kindergarten and get educated workers 15 years later. Besides empirical studies show that a good education system requires considerable public investment, and thus a larger percentage of GDP spent on government.<p>4) <i>world's cheapest transportation system and one that is virtually free from uncertainty caused by congestion </i> - again this requires substantial public investment, and is a long term commitment. You will have to spend a good amount of GDP on infrastructure and will only reap the rewards after a decade.<p>I have to admit that this reads a bit like when you hear politicians talk about technology - it is apparent that their understanding of the domain is not very deep.",1230926205

Say it's a $200 per household subsidy.  Maybe it makes sense for that family to pay it to the landlord, but maybe it makes sense to find a cheaper apartment and spend it on a TV.  If it turns out that the TV was the chosen decision, that helps drive down the price of rent b/c maybe the landlord will have a slightly harder time raising rent prices.  If, on the other hand, the tenant chooses to allocate the money to housing, it will help drive up housing prices.  The upside of driving up housing prices is that it now becomes more worthwhile for someone to convert their house into apartments, which in turn increases supply and would tend to help keep prices affordable.",1230924036

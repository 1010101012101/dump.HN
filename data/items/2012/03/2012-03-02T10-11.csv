3656158,comment,3654091,3655926,3,0,dirkdeman,,,"Books... not so much. I have another idea: you could check out an MVC-framework like codeigniter or CakePHP. There are numerous tutorials about them, and they give you the added benefit of working with an MVC pattern (knowledge you can use in other languages and frameworks as well, such as Ruby on Rails) and working Object Oriented.<p>In my opinion, a big drawback of PHP is that it's so easy to screw up because it's easy to pick up. There are so many tutorials out there which will let you make a procedural, cross-scripted, sql-injected security liability spaghetti code... Starting with CodeIgniter or CakePHP is not very hard, especially when you have a little understanding on basic programming with PHP.

3656141,comment,3655931,3655931,12,0,ThomPete,,,"It's a European cultural issue. Denmark is not any different.<p>There are big discussions in Denmark right now about how to create growth. So the following can be applied to Germany as well I think.<p>I am saddened to see that most politicians thinking is:<p>1. Education
2. Green Tech (Wind Mills and Wave Mills primarily with government funding. Yes you heard that right)
3. Upgrading your education
4. Education
5. Innovation<p>All completely useless. And here is why:<p>1. Less than 5% of people with higher education in Denmark starts companies.<p>2. Green tech is not a thing. It's a term a vague one like UX. Let it go on record that the next bubble will be the green tech bubble.<p>What we should be talking about is technology, chemistry, biology, physics and various combinations of those.<p>Instead as seem to be the case in most of Europe eager to ditch nuclear (an actually fairly environmentally friendly energy source) governments are betting on specific technologies. Completely disregarding that it's impossible to get any proper economy into them anytime soon.<p>What can I say, sigh...<p>3. Denmark has a fairly large group of blue collars. Of course it makes some sense to try and upgrade them and I am sure it helps with some of them. But the battle to get a proper production industry up and running is simply futile and wont work.<p>First of all, the danish salaries are some of the highest in the world. Danes have some of the most protecting laws to the blue collar worker (no I am not at all against that, just trying to explain why it wont work) That means we are loosing to Germany and Poland and Sweden.<p>Danish Engineer ca. 40.000 DKK
Polish Engineer ca. 15.000 DKK
Indian Engineer ca. 5.000 DKK (if not less)<p>Just to show you the difference here. Anyone having done outsourcing knows that the quality can be different but it really depends on what kind of project we are talking about.<p>Second. The US lost 4 million jobs to the Chinese between 98-04. In the same period of time the chinese lost 18 million jobs to ... the robots.<p>Everything that can be automated will be automated and believing that we can somehow resurrect an industry that never really where that competitive is just pure insanity. Even engineers are loosing jobs.<p>4. Yes education once again. This is just to illustrate how much the government believe in this. Recently a study was done that showed that companies with most Phds had the highest revenue. This was then used as a proof to show just how important education is for the future of this country.<p>Now anyone who have spent just a couple of days on HN knows one of the biggest fallacies gets called out here.<p>""Correlation != causation""<p>Of course the other take on this story could be. The companies with the highest turnover had the most Phds hired.<p>The report made no attempt to claim connection between the number of Phds and the financial success of the company. No. Leave that the to the politicians.<p>5. According to our politicians we are supposed to grow from the experience economy and through innovation. Our cultural minister even have made a ""task force"" of cultural celebrities from around europe who are to travel around europe and find out how to use art as a vehicle for growth and innovation.<p>Yes you heard it right. This is the kind of insanity we are dealing with here.<p>Never mind that saying we need innovation has as little effect on the ability of a country to innovate as saying green tech creates green technology. The politicians actually believe that they can intellectualize growth and progress.<p>In other words. Everything that is right about SV is wrong about Denmark and my guess most places in Europe.",1330685044

But I'm not sure a subscription model is the way to go.  
I do know R&D teams are gonna have a hard time getting permission to use it.
They have all the tools they need, their projects are secret, it's not going to fly with upper management.<p>I do like the fact that you can search for components and buy them.
I'm sure there's some affiliate revenue in there.
Although I have to say, it's probably not that easy, because companies usually have long-term agreements in place with suppliers, there's a lot of bureaucracy, you have to get a purchase order before you're allowed to buy something.
I'm not saying that's good or bad, but that's usually the way it is. And it's a problem for Upverter.<p>Getting PCBs manufactured is a good idea as well, especially for people who use Kickstarter and want to build a prototype.
The companies I know might be hesitant to use it. Especially for R&D projects, they will use their own equipment or outsource it to a local supplier they know they can trust. And this guy is going to say it's gonna cost you x, but I can do it cheaper if you let me manufacture the first 10,000 units. 
And it gets really tricky when you're working on a cutting edge product, because you can't always buy every component off the shelf. The manufacturer is gonna say ok, I'm gonna help you but I can't buy component x cheap enough, or I'm gonna help you but you have to ship me component a,b,c before day x.<p>The design of your site looks really good but you need photographs of products that have been build.

The highs are good, whether they're based on real-world success, or your invisible fuel, the die-hard belief in what you're pursuing. You need those highs: milk them for all their worth.<p>But what goes up, must come down. Whether based on a real setback, or a stray negative thought, it doesn't take much to send you back down to earth, or straight through to hell. When the confidence evaporates, suddenly those unpleasant realities you were dismissing all hit you at once, and it's too much to deal with.<p>Everything you mentioned is great for riding out depression: sleep, a good meal, exercise, relaxation. You've got the treatment covered quite well. But after you bounce back, pay attention to that ""winning"" feeling, and work on moderating it to just the level you want, so that it can burn for longer, and you have less far to fall. Keep spending time on basic human needs, even when you're on top and you feel capable of 18-hour days.<p>Ideally, you want a steady engine, not bursts of up and down.

In the public's mind the well is some distance off, many not even knowing it exists, so there is plenty of time to get security better sorted before the average man on the street has his money invested.<p>Also, everyone knows that cash and other forms of investment are far from safe anyway. Hopefully people will eventually see online currency as being no less safe than other forms, and if the security is done <i>right</i> they'll see it as more safe (as it <i>could</i> be).<p>But this seems to me to be a general security issue with decentralised anything, not a bitcoin specific problem. If you remove central control, and take as full control yourself as possible, then you remove responsibility from other people and that is something you need to seriously think about. Providers like Linode will not be taking responsibility for financial loss in these cases and paying for hefty insurance policies to underwrite the possibility of said loss: they'll just add clauses to their contract disavowing themselves of responsibility if such clauses don't already exist.<p>One way to protect yourself is to spread the money around multiple places, then one hacked provider doesn't put all your resource at risk. Again this isn't bitcoin specific: if you have more then 50K to invest over here (in the UK) then you split it between multiple organisations as only 50K per registered organisation is guaranteed protected by national safety nets provided by government.<p>Back onto ""poising the well"" this could of course work the other way around: if the virtual currency is worth the effort of stealing then it might be seen as more valuable in the eyes of the public - much like a sign you have a good product is that knock-off copies start appearing.",1330683598

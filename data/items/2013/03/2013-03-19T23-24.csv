We are forgetting a important (4) : you fund atrocious wars and dictatorships. That's a strong negative externality.<p>When you see a diamonds, instead of seeing a shiny rock, you should see part of a human soul instead, a fraction of a person who died in vain for this worthless piece of rock you want for your wives or daughters to ""sustain the tradition"".<p>If social convention required 1 pound of flesh taken by the knife on a living human, would you insist on it, for the sake of the tradition? (I fear many would - after all, it matches the 1,2,3 requirements)<p>If social convention requires a diamond, which you know very well will cause war, death and misery, and if you did not say yes to the previous question, why are you insisting on it?<p>It strikes me as illogical, inconsistent. Either you believe that human life is more important than tradition, or you don't. I can understand diverging opinions, I can hardly understand inconsistency in a system of belief, so I'm very sad to see intelligent replies advocating this 1,2,3 argument while missing the huge downside #4 is.<p>Maybe someday the sale of things containing ""natural diamonds"" will be banned - just like the sale of things containing bald eagles feathers.<p>IHMO, it should: as much as I love the market and freedom, sometimes externalities are just too big to be ignored - especially when there is also a monopolist in action, and perfect substitutes like man made diamonds.",1363737578

Utility has nothing to do with supply.<p>The other article only prove my point.

Because of this, industrial diamonds tend to be man-made.  (for reference, industrial diamonds when cutting hard materials, such as metals).<p>While working on these diamonds, GE decided to start investigating making consumer level diamonds that could be sold for jewelry.  They were able to produce diamonds that would have excelled when compared to natural diamonds (when it comes to the 4 Cs).  One of the fun things was they could add various gases to the manufacturing process to create diamonds of various colors.  There is still a decent cost associated with producing diamonds this way, so they probably would have still been expensive, but not at the levels that De Beers was charging at the time.<p>At this point GE started to look into what would happen if they would have actually gone down this line, selling consumer-level diamonds.  After a little investigation, the GE lawyers and upper-management decided to kill off the idea as it would not have been worth the hassle.  De Beers started a small campaign that was discrediting man-made diamonds, and it would have gotten a lot worse if GE even tried to enter the market.  GE decided it was not worth the hassle, and killed the consumer-level diamond project.<p>De Beers has created an artificial market and they are doing what they can to prevent anyone else from entering their market.  Most companies don't want to deal going up against them, so they just leave De Beers to run around gouging consumers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_diamond#High_pressure.2C_high_temperature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_diamond#High_pressure...</a>",1363736043

A university education is a massive commitment of time and money, and in many cases the qualification itself, rather than the knowledge, is the end goal and thus the investment is largely lost if you stop partway through<p>- Convenience. Learn what you want, in your own time, at your own rate.<p>- Internet/forum culture. The communities tend to be cooperative and interested in teaching and explaining, and the atmosphere is positive. For people used to forums this can be easier to deal with than a classroom environment.<p>Overall, I find MOOCs tend to cover an excellent middle ground between the rigid style of teaching commonly found in established educational institutions and the individual learner mentality that educates itself by looking for tutorials, reading books, and learning by doing.<p>As to ""what motivates people to take MOOCs?"", they are convenient options for educating and furthering oneself. For some people, learning is a lifelong goal or a fundamental interest in acquiring new knowledge/skills. Learning can be useful for people looking to upskill in order to access new opportunities (self-employment, change of careers/employer). I recommend it to people who find themselves stuck in a rut (feel like life isn't going anywhere). Visible progression has positive feedback and can be stimulating.",1363735983

By firing them, they have to go home to their wife and kids and tell them the news, that _they_ were rejected, that _they_ failed (even if it's not true). Managers don't want to inflict this on people, but they're looking out for something greater than an individual employee, they're looking out for their team.<p>The other trouble is that sometimes under performance isn't the employee's fault. They were a bad match for the team, but your interview wasn't a good filter for that. Or maybe family issues are making them unfocused. Or their job has morphed out of their control into something beyond their skill set. Point is, even if someone needs to be laid off, they don't deserve to be punished.<p>What they are proposing is not no-firing, it's making firing expensive, and treating people respectfully during it. Some companies fire quickly. Others, really slowly - mostly because there's no process for it, and nobody wants to take initiative to get rid of someone. Both have problems.

5404356,comment,5403988,5404128,35,0,rayiner,,,"It irks me a little bit that the issue is painted as one of ""reason"" versus lack thereof. There is a rationality in adhering to social convention.<p>My wife is a diamond nerd, as well as one of the most rational people you'll ever meet, and she'd explain it this way: the diamond is a test that serves various useful purposes from the perspective of the woman:<p>1) It demonstrates the man's ability to provide;
2) It demonstrates the man's willingness to forgo the other things he could buy with the money for a gift for her that does not directly benefit him in any way; and
3) It demonstrates to the woman's peers her husband's social standing.<p>An important thing to remember is that women take on a huge opportunity cost in getting married and having kids. My wife and I just had our first baby. Pregnancy and childbirth is a barbaric process and a woman will never be quite the same after. Taking care of an infant is tiring, stressful, boring, and thankless--and no matter how enlightened the husband is and how willing he is to help out, because of the baby's hard-wired inclinations the buck will always stop with the wife. Finally, if the woman is educated and has a career, that career will be permanently compromised by virtue of getting married and having kids. With all this in the background, it is evident that the social convention of the ring conveys valuable information to a woman considering getting married and bearing these costs. Re: 1, all else being equal a man that can provide more is more valuable than a man that can provide less. Re: 2, all else being equal a man that is willing to forgo things for himself is better than a man who is not; Re: 3, all else being equal a woman's social life will be positively affected in a tangible way by marring a man of higher social standing than of a lower one. It is totally rational for a woman to ask: ""I'm willing to give up all this, what are you willing to do?"" The ring is just a way to demonstrate this commitment in a way that is universally understood and spares everyone the awkward conversation of laying all the chips on the table.<p>Now, these elements are less important in 2013 than they were in say 1813. But at the same time to an extent they are not diminished in importance, but rather culture has shifted to downplay the uncomfortable truths at the root of these elements. For example, we like to downplay how much women really give up by being the child-bearers. But for an educated woman, if having kids cuts the probability of attaining a high position on her career by half,[1] the choice to have kids could mean millions of dollars in lost income over a lifetime. It's totally rational for a woman thinking of making such a compromise to demand from her potential husband a gesture showing that he is willing and able to take the other half of the bargain. But all this is something that we don't say in polite company, because we have fully bought into the mythologies about marriage that are in vogue at the moment: that it's just about ""love"" and all that matters is a mate that makes you ""happy"" and that it's an arrangement that is costless to enter into and exit out of.<p>There is, of course, nothing inherent about diamonds that makes them the only option for this kind of signaling. Indeed, in other cultures a cash gift is the norm instead. But the value of a signal is in its standardization, so to speak, and it just so happens that the diamond is the standard signal in western culture.<p>[1] Less than 20% of women never have kids, but about half of very high achieving women (executives, etc) never have kids.",1363735371

You know we&#x27;re planning on buying over 2000?<p>If you think jets are so delicate, you haven&#x27;t been paying attention to the mishap rate with drones. It&#x27;s not like an RC model you&#x27;re controlling within sight. You&#x27;re operating them at ranges where lag is significant, where control links can be jammed, where GPS is easily spoofed, and where current performance is similar to a small Cessna.<p>How pray tell, is a small, cheap drone going to be able to carry a high power laser or &quot;high energy RF&quot; weapon (whatever that is) to the altitude that modern jets operate at? And if these &quot;high energy RF&quot; weapons are available, why wouldn&#x27;t they be deployed on fighters, which can carry heavier weapons than drones, and have more surplus electrical capacity to power them?<p>It&#x27;s easy to come up with armchair tactics when it&#x27;s all Starcraft you&#x27;re drawing upon. But the military doesn&#x27;t work like that. Weapons take time to design, to implement, to refine. You can&#x27;t just set your factories up to build UNIT X and ZERG!",1454561998
11032089,comment,11030739,11031273,0,0,jacquesm,,,"In WWII pilot lives were cheap and planes were relatively simple to fly. To fly an F35 the investment in the pilot is huge. Add to that the fact that deaths on &#x27;your own side&#x27; are no longer as acceptable as they were in the past during conflicts mean that many can&#x27;t be built to replace those lost to attrition.<p>The more war goes &#x27;remote control&#x27; the more this will cease to be an issue, and this is a dangerous trend precisely because it removes one of the last impediments to scaling up the export of war. As soon as the losses to own troops drop to near zero because all of it is done through robotic means all bets are off, and it does not even require a &#x27;skynet&#x27; in order to achieve it. All it takes is some more telepresence and that&#x27;s pretty much a solved problem at this stage. The difference is that in the air we now have this and for other branches it is still being worked on but within a decade or two we should see robotic infantry.",1454561996

That&#x27;s more interesting, because cornering is hard.<p>The MIT system is maglev against a passive track. The Transrapid system, used in the Shanghai airport maglev, requires an active track, which is why it&#x27;s so expensive. Maglev with a passive track means a simpler track but high power consumption on the vehicle. Power has to be supplied to the vehicle in some way.  MIT is using batteries, which is fine for a 1 mile run, but doesn&#x27;t scale.<p>The Incheon airport maglev just started service yesterday.

From this FastCompany article it&#x27;s inspired by Futura and Univers though sounds like it&#x27;s more or less a custom job:<p>> At the time, Lindon was &quot;in love with two bold fonts&quot; known as Univers 67, which is a condensed bold type, and Futura Bold. He takes me through how he started playing with the two typefaces and the letter spacing, from extremely wide to locked together, uppercase and lowercase, mixing and tinkering. One iteration had a capital E and a lowercase x: &quot;I started squeezing the letter spacing, I saw a white arrow start to appear between the E and the x. I thought, ‘There’s something there.’ I tried both fonts, but I didn’t like how much I had to distort either typeface to make the arrow look good. I thought, ‘Would it be possible to blend the best features of both?’ I took the high x of Univers and mixed it with the stroke of Futura Bold. The x rose to the crossbar of a lowered E. I kept tweaking, and eventually not only did the arrow look natural and unforced, but I ended up with a whole new letterform.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671067/the-story-behind-the-famous-fedex-logo-and-why-it-works"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671067/the-story-behind-the-fam...</a>",1454561840

While it&#x27;s possible for several hardware/firmware to fail in all your datacenters, for them to fail at the same time is highly unlikely.  This may just be a PR spin to think they&#x27;re not vulnerable to security attacks.<p>While this was happening at Github, I noticed several other companies facing that same issue at the same time.  Atlassian was down for the most part.  It could have been an issue with the service github uses, but they won&#x27;t admit that.  Notice they never said what the firmware issue was instead blaming it on &#x27;hardware&#x27;.<p>I think they should be transparent with people about such vulnerability, but I suspect they would never say so because then they would lose revenue.<p>Here on my blog I talked about this issue: <a href=""http://julesjaypaulynice.com/simple-server-malicious-attacks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julesjaypaulynice.com/simple-server-malicious-attacks...</a><p>I think it was some ddos campaign going on over the web.",1454561816

11032073,comment,11018668,11018668,0,0,avmich,,,"I always thought an interesting idea would be to launch an unmanned Soyuz to dock with Columbia.<p>In 1960&#x27;s Soyuzes were launched sometimes without orbital module - project Zond; that&#x27;s saving of about 15% of mass. Even if that wouldn&#x27;t be sufficient, Zonds were launched on Protons with DM kicker - and that combination flew as far as over the Moon, so I&#x27;m sure it could match Columbia orbit inclination and height.<p>Russians launch on average more often than anybody else, so they could pull that attempt. Problems are that Soyuz spacecraft takes 2 years to manufacture - but money could have helped there, especially in 2003, before oil prices made incomes larger in Russia. Protons were manufactured in larger quantities - may be more that 10 per year. Even with one Soyuz - for 3 crew - some Progress spacecrafts, which are built in larger numbers, could be added rather soon, maintaining the remaining Columbia crew until further options would become available.<p>So, to sum this up - Russian spacecrafts could technically reach Columbia in 2003.",1454561572

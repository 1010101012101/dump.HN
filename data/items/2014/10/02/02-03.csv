People try out the free (GPL) version, and like it, want premium features, want support, want you to add features etc.<p>There&#x27;s a subtle competitive benefit of free: by providing something valuable for free that meets people&#x27;s needs, there&#x27;s less demand for an open-source free competitor. In a way, this is a nice reward for helping people; but if it&#x27;s too effective, it can stifle innovation (by avoiding the pressure on you from competitors to improve).<p>Now of course, GPL has other benefits apart from free-as-in-beer: you have the code. You can audit it; add your own features; fix bugs. And if the developer gets hit by a bus, you can carry on without any escrow nonsense, incompleteness, unmaintainable code. It&#x27;s also a business benefit to the developer, as they can get bug-fixes and features and improvements from the community. But because it&#x27;s only part of the code that is GPL, they only get part of this benefit.<p>However, typically, the biggest benefit of GPL is bug-<i>reports</i> --- but you still get them from free users who don&#x27;t have the code. (They won&#x27;t be as good, but usually the hard thing about a bug is that it exists). You typically won&#x27;t get much code you can actually use especially if you want to retain sole copyright (though it can be useful to have as a first draft; and have some good ideas).\nPlus... some people might be reluctant to contribute their effort to someone who&#x27;s making money (even though they got the code for free).<p>tl;dr: unsurprisingly, free-as-in-beer is far more significant for a business, than free-as-in-freedom.",1412218441

This unlocks you to use random access aggressively and build lock-free indexes (atomic instructions are available only for data that&#x27;s in memory). With these tradeoffs you can build extremely concurrent data structures that simply aren&#x27;t possible with a system that must manage a buffer cache.

This is simply not the case - we&#x27;ve had durability since the first ever public release of MemSQL, including both asynchronous and synchronous modes.<p>MemSQL now also has distributed transactions and MPP, supports intra and inter data-center replication, semi-structured (JSON) data, and even has a column store that works as a hybrid between disk and in-memory.<p>And BTW, I actually agree with this mentality in the context of column stores.

8399163,comment,8398127,8398127,4,0,kfcm,,,"Some thoughts.<p>First, I work with various companies, many of which have remote work options. These options range from a couple days/week remote, to 100% remote.  What I&#x27;m hearing from employees at the companies which have remote work implemented is they don&#x27;t want to work for a company which doesn&#x27;t offer remote work at the same level or better as their current employer. And the more time spent working away from the office, the more adamant the employees are about this.<p>And these employees aren&#x27;t only technologists either.  I&#x27;m hearing the same thing from accounting, marketing, etc department employees who get a taste of remote work, and really don&#x27;t want to go back to butts-in-seats. And their reasons are similar to the tech side--productivity goes up, no commute, fewer meetings and annoying co-workers.<p>Second, there are very few technical reasons (I won&#x27;t say none) that a company can&#x27;t enable remote workers and save a ton on real estate costs.  Skype, Google Hangouts, Facetime and even WebRTC (even in it&#x27;s current state), show that individual/team-based video collaboration is possible over commonly available 20-50 Mb/s connections. VoIP enables an employee&#x27;s &quot;desk phone&quot; to follow them anywhere (I was doing this with a headset/laptop/VPN in 2001).  Chat is heavily used, even in the &quot;business side&quot; (accounting, etc) for traceability.<p>The main technical problem is still reliable bandwidth.  Even though 20-50 Mb/s suffices, 100 Mb/s or even 1 Gb/s active fiber would be better, to achieve corporate LAN-like speeds at home.  Around this region, FTTP-enabled homes are selling like hotcakes.<p>Finally, with the advent of &quot;The Cloud&quot; or just plain old-fashioned datacenter hosting, there&#x27;s really no difference between working in a cube or working from home. Everything&#x27;s already remote.  In this sense, many corporate employees--with systems and co-workers located in another building/city/country--have a huge head start on this compared to start-up employees.",1412217657

For what it&#x27;s worth, I <i>would</i> cite the publication which prompted the idea behind my approach, so I don&#x27;t think this is the answer to your question.<p>That being said, I think you&#x27;re onto something. I was recently involved in a project leading to a paper for a conference, and while I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;ll get accepted (meaning I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s even representative of the kinds of papers conferences want to see), I notice in hindsight that we had only a few citations that really informed a totally novel methodological approach we used. By contrast, we cited a <i>ton</i> of research in the domain area we studied.<p>So my takeaway is that it&#x27;s hard to bring in dozens of papers to inform one&#x27;s methods necessarily because methods (like a protocol) require one somewhat coherent narrative. Integrating the collective body of knowledge about a topic (like, oh let&#x27;s say.. online labor markets) is a lot easier, making &quot;rapid-fire&quot; citations in that context more likely.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a seasoned researcher (or at least someone with the experience of a few publications) weigh in on this though.",1412217190

I\nhave to respect most of what he said.<p>Still, from some of what he said, I have a tough time\ntaking him literally:  E.g., as I recall from the\nlecture, he indicated that early on Google was just\na little thing, just a small interest, or some such.<p>However, also, as is well-known, even in the early\ndays of Google even as just an <i>idea</i>, Internet\nsearch was already widely regarded as an important\nneed and problem.  Without checking dates, there\nwas, what, Lycos and Yahoo!, maybe more?<p>Without means of search, the Internet was like being\nin the world&#x27;s biggest library with all the books,\netc. just in a big pile.  For libraries, the\nsolution has long been the library card catalog,\nespecially the subject index.  So I have to suspect\nthat, even in the beginnings of the idea for Google,\nthe founders did understand that what they were\nworking on was possibly important as a business.<p>Next, the lecture did mention that Ron Conway wrote\nGoogle an early check:  I have to believe that\nConway took the future of Google fully seriously.<p>From all I know, Facebook, Microsoft, Cisco, Intel,\netc. all knew early on, at the beginning of the\n<i>idea</i> or not long after, that they were trying to\nmake a successful business.<p>But the lecture seemed to be suggesting that at the\nstart an <i>idea</i> is hardly more than a toy or\ncuriosity.<p>Next there was,<p>> The way to get startup ideas is not to think about\nhaving good startups ideas: you’ll get bad and\nplausible ideas that will end up wasting your time.<p>> To have a good idea, take a step back and don’t\neven try.<p>While I can believe that PG has plenty of examples\nwhere startups followed this advice and were\nsuccessful, still I&#x27;m shocked and have a tough time\nswallowing that this advice is the only way to be\nsuccessful or that, in particular, always any effort\nto find a good <i>idea</i><p>> will end up wasting your time.<p>Instead, I&#x27;d like to build on PG&#x27;s<p>> What you really need to learn are your users’\nneeds.<p>Now I&#x27;m on board!<p>But then I want to go farther:  Okay, not everyone\nhas to go along with my next thinking, and here is\nsome of why:  First, there&#x27;s not just one way to\n&quot;skin a cat&quot; or be successful.  Second, and\nsomething I regard as very important for successful\nstartups, as we know too well, a really successful\nstartup is rare, so rare that we have to suspect\nthat, not all, but some of the most successful\nstartups will be taking approaches that are new and\nwith few or no examples from the past, say, 30 years\nin Silicon Valley venture funded startups.<p>Moreover, if a startup looks close to what has been\ntried, and even worked, before, then we have to be\nsuspicions and question if that &quot;what&quot; should be\ntried again instead of something new.<p>But, broad strokes, aside, let&#x27;s try to be more\ndefinite:<p>Step (1) Need.<p>Assume we&#x27;ve seen some users&#x27; need.  Suppose we use\nsome judgment here and accept only a genuine need.\nSuch a need might be, say, a safe, effective, cheap\none pill taken once to cure any cancer.  Yup, that&#x27;s\ndefinitely a need -- no question.  We want a need so\nserious that we can be quite sure, e.g., the pill,\nthat the first good or a much better solution will\nbe a <i>must have</i> and not just a <i>nice to have</i>.  So,\nwe pick a need.<p>Now I narrow the scope:  We want to exploit Moore&#x27;s\nlaw and the Internet and do have a need that, at least\nfor its solution, is in <i>information technology</i>.\nOne reason:  Can send to the users just bits, and\nthose sent just over the Internet.<p>Step (2) Solution.<p>With the need, we try to find the first good or a\nmuch better solution.  If we fail, as we likely\nwould for years on a cure for cancer, or, in\ninformation technology, a project were we needed an\nalgorithm that shows that P = NP, we return to Step\n(1) and find another genuine need.<p>Step (3) How to<p>So, how can we find a solution?<p>Well, here&#x27;s my suggestion:  Right, even with PG&#x27;s\nbroad experience, the suggestion may so far never\nhave been seen even by PG in Silicon Valley.  So, in\nthis sense we&#x27;re talking something new, and we keep\nin mind that we should not be reluctant to pursue\nsomething new since being new and different is from\nmaybe good up to crucial for the rare, big successes\nin the future.<p>But for something new, we very much want some\nevidence of, say, <i>efficacy</i>, or will that dog hunt?<p>So, we have a problem, and we want a solution, in\ninformation technology, and a solution we have high\nconfidence in, even before we start writing\nsoftware.  So, where can we find examples of doing\nthat?  Sure:  The US DoD.  They&#x27;ve been doing that\nwith, comparatively, a great batting average for 70+\nyears, that is, finding solutions that well informed\npeople can have high confidence in before starting\nimplementation.<p>So, we have<p>Lesson 1:  By example, it&#x27;s actually possible,\nand in the US DoD quite common, nearly standard, to\nfind solutions that well informed people can have\nhigh confidence in before starting implementation.<p>Now, this lesson, and the fairly obvious DoD\nexamples, e.g., the SR-71, were often quite\nexpensive to implement.  But, there is also<p>Lesson 2:  The implementation work commonly was\nroutine, that is, low risk, maybe expensive but,\nstill, low risk.<p>More of my suggestion:  It can be good, when we can,\nto convert the work of finding the solution to a\nmathematical problem where, if the math is correct,\nthen we are quite sure the solution is correct and,\nquite likely, effective as a solution for the need.<p>Advantages here include:  (A) The math has a good\nchance of being done just on paper by just one\nperson, with very low &quot;burn rate&quot;.  (B) The math is\ncomparatively easy to check for correctness.  (C)\nSince we have assumed that our startup is in\ninformation technology, a solution based on math has\na big <i>natural</i> advantage; e.g., maybe the\nimplementation is just software with no metal\nbending, team of thousands, big buildings, etc.<p>So (1)-(3) is my suggestion for insight into how to\nfind a good <i>idea</i> for a startup.<p>So, where is this suggestion for finding a startup\n<i>idea</i> unclear, wrong?",1412217074

Classified ads were a major revenue source of revenue for newspapers. Craigslist has cannibalized that business. Craiglist has cost the newspaper industry billions of dollars[1] and made millions in return.[2] Here&#x27;s a 2009 article:[3]<p>&quot;Many newspaper executives view Craigslist as a nemesis because it doesn&#x27;t charge for most ads. As Craigslist and scores of other websites have offered free or less expensive alternatives, newspapers&#x27; total revenue from the classified advertising in print editions has waned from a peak of nearly $20 billion in 2000 to about $10 billion last year.<p>Meanwhile, Craigslist has been raking in more revenue from the ad listings that it does charge for in major U.S. markets. Most of the money comes from help-wanted ads — another former cash cow for newspapers that has been drying up.<p>Craigslist&#x27;s annual revenue has risen from just $7 million in 2003 to $81 million last year, according to the AIM Group. Based on its count of paid ads appearing on Craigslist in recent months, the company&#x27;s revenue should be about $100 million this year, the consultants predicted.&quot;<p>Craigslist is that whole &quot;your margin is my opportunity&quot; thing everyone loves to throw around. Craigslist took over the market because they charged less than anyone else, and they could charge less because their margin on classified ads was lower than anybody&#x27;s. Newspapers couldn&#x27;t compete with Craigslist on margins because they were using those margins to subsidize the actual news-gathering apparatus, which was a loss leader to get people to buy the paper so they could put ads in it.<p>1) <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/13/ny-nyu-stern-school-idUSnBw135869a+100+BSW20130813"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/13/ny-nyu-stern-schoo...</a>\n2) <a href=""http://aimgroup.com/2012/11/07/craigslist-2012-revenues-increase-9-7-big-four-battle-for-global-classified-lead/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aimgroup.com/2012/11/07/craigslist-2012-revenues-incr...</a>\n3) <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7804695"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7804695</a>",1412215332

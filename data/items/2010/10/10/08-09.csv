1776804,comment,1776575,1776575,0,0,tyng,,,"When I saw the title ""zero-equity co-founder"" I thought it was about inspiring employees to work as committed as an actual co-founder, which would be totally appropriate.<p>I think the downside of single founder startup is that 1. there's no one to bounce your ideas with; 2. speed to market is greatly reduced; 3. there's no one to share the stress or keep each other motivated when things get tough; and most importantly, 4. there's no one to share the joy when you manage to solve a business/technical problem that is not visible to outsiders.<p>I don't see any apparent advantage of keeping a single founder startup. You may have the ability to run the startup as well or even better as a multi-cofounder startup and keep all the shares - but it's not fun, and fun is very important for an entrepreneur!",1286700914

1776802,comment,1775712,1776636,0,0,srean,,,"Your comment seems to make the case that markets are competitive whereas governments are monopolistic. I feel reluctant to buy into that without an authoritative statistical study. My experience, though anecdotal, does not lean in that direction significantly enough.<p>On the other hand scholars[1] have argued that much of the first world have made the bulk of their progress in very protectionist environments and have opened their markets selectively when it was to their advantage. I havent seen those arguments debunked  effectively. The notion of ""free""ness of current markets is also debatable given that it is guarded strongly by international politics.<p>Mathematically speaking, I do not recollect that free markets guarantee equity as has been claimed in some comments here. They do guarantee <i>an</i> equilibrium, which however need not be a good/desirable one.(Think traffic flow without signals).<p>I am not against free markets, I think thats perhaps the best option available, but as long as it remains easy to externalize costs, it will continue to remain broken. Because what you are paying is only part of the cost and someone else is being forced to pick up the tab.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ha-Joon_Chang"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ha-Joon_Chang</a>",1286700820

Many societies around the world take it for granted that services is a part of...well...""service"". For example, when I was in Turkey with my wife, we were a just your average cafe. We really like the little tea spoons that they had, and wanted some for home. We asked the waiter if the cafe had any extra they would mind selling us. He told us that the ones they had were all dinged and used, and wouldn't it be better to have some brand new spoons? We agreed, and he sent one of the other boys working in the back down to the local store to buy some for us while we sat and sipped our tea.<p>Ordinary little cafe...nothing really that out of the ordinary...so why is this so foreign in America?",1286700060

They are not just a knowledge-base of solutions. No. They're engines for <i>creating</i> new solutions, but also the means to <i>pose</i> knew questions and problems. Problems you never knew you had, and solutions you never thought of, or thought were acceptable (like ""who cares, forget it"" -- humans are excellent at these types of dismissive approaches to problem solving; we have an intuitive knack for ruling out issues that are not worth bothering with. And by ""we"" I don't mean programmers, sticklers for the tedium and observers of minutia.)<p>At the very least, a human co-founder allows you to take a day off, picks up your spouse from the airport, and comes with you for happy hour. I would kill for someone who is ""in"" on it with me. These types of ""benefits"" might not merit any sophisticated Rumsfeldian epistemology (""there are unknown unknowns"", etc.) but they're very important, and I say that as someone who sorely lacks them.",1286698763

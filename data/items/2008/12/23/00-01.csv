This particular site's bias/philosophy/view is one of many.<p>For a more moderate and well-written exploration/manual on Taoist sexual practices, I suggest Mantak Chia's ""The Multi-Orgasmic Man"", which teaches the practitioner to separate ejaculation from orgasm (among other things.) It also affirms that regular ejaculation is necessary and beneficial to men.<p>Notably, there are a variety of things that associate themselves with the label ""Taoism"", and it is important to understand that there is not a single authoritative canon or lineage that represents ""real"" Taoism. Rather, there is a complex history of various cross-pollinating traditions throughout chinese history, some of which are closely associated with people who associated themselves with the idea of the Tao.",1229993406

I am very busy for many parts of the year, and often don't have time to read leisurely even though I would very much like to. I imagine the idea of an HN book club would help in this regard, as I would be much more motivated to make time (like a co-founder motivates you to keep going!).<p>What do you guys say? If this post has enough upvotes (say 10), start discussing options for the first book, and whether weekly or monthly would work better.<p>EDIT: lallysingh below has made the following suggestion of topics. This seems like a very good fit judging by the posts on HN, as well as the comments already present.<p>1. High-level programming, probably functional-related.<p>2. Business/startup<p>3. Some quality-of-life stuff.<p>Perhaps newer releases (or exotic material) might be a good choice due to the presence of ideas not yet assimilated, discussed, or pondered by many of us.<p>EDIT2: Judging by the time concerns below, maybe it is wise to start with something short (say under 250 pages).<p>EDIT3: If we're going to go with fiction, this looks like a good list to pick from:<p>http://www.goodreads.com/list/show/6.Best_Books_of_the_20th_Century<p>Personally, I've read almost none of these!",1229992803

What percentage are front-end heavy web-apps/aggregators? What percentage are fairly ambitious and require a serious research, development and have a huge potential for growth? That's a question you may be able to answer better than anyone else (although I'd imagine most YC applicants are a self-selected crowd and those hoping for an exit other than M&A and to hire a great deal of talent may not even apply to YC).<p>I also didn't think about the investment angle at all.

I don't believe in the 7-day creation, but that doesn't mean there's no higher power that played a role in the big bang, creation of life, and subsequent evolution.<p>The biggest problem Religion has is its resistance to change. The Bible was written thousands of years ago, across many centuries. It was written for its own time. As our knowledge and understanding of the world around us and the universe at large changes, so must our interpretation of the Bible.<p>It may sound lame, but the movie Dogma had a profound impact on my religious beliefs.

Stack traces are typical but since exceptions are objects they can contain any amount of extra information.  Error codes are typically integers.  Sometimes they're just negative integers.<p>- Exceptions free-up the return of functions for useful results.

440032,comment,439605,439759,0,0,Retric,,,"I think the non-profit sector provides a relief valve and helps keep society honest.  Non-profit like Open Source Software can channel peoples desire to fix problems without fighting the rest of society. Government has a lot of power, but it is highly susceptible to outside influences and everyone wants to spend other peoples money.  At the same time they don't force the customers to pay for the service which limits how corporations could get involved.<p>PS: Consider the three types of news organizations and how they fit into our society.  Or blood banks, you can't pay people for blood or you get diseased donors, you don't want to force people to donate and you don't need that much, so you just ask people to help and it works fairly well.",1232337454

440030,comment,439512,439984,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"In my understanding, the growing trend is to distrust new technology until it can be proven to have no harm on, for example, the environment. That is a ridiculous standard. Of course, so is banning federal funding for stem cell research, so you're right about the American system being more conservative in areas.<p>Increased spending on medicine usually corresponds to measures that wouldn't be taken in more nationalized systems. Late stage treatment of diseases and proceeding with risky births are two examples.<p>It's this kind of spending at the edges that matters a lot for where money and research time is spent.<p>My big fear with a change that isn't deregulation is to remove this incentive. The accounting is obviously difficult. How much value to you assign to a technology that increases life expectancy for a certain kind of disease? If you're comparing %GDP, surely an increased survival rate has a positive affect on GDP. How can you possibly account for that?<p>Numbers like the %GDP spent on medicine and life expectancy takes the aggregate information in a dynamic system of 300M nodes and reduces it down to two numbers that don't mean much for any given individual. For me personally, I'd like to see more research into predicting ailments, individual funding of research to fight ailments that are likely, and much more out of pocket spending on day to day treatment. Unfortunately, the national dialogue consists of many people who have no trouble paying for medical care debating how much of other people's money they should spend on the mythical set of the uninsured.",1232337282

The inability of monsters to cast spells, and the lack of need to for the player to 'conserve resources' as he pushes deeper into the dungeon trivialized some of the challenge to the game. If those features were going to stay 'gone,' the game needed another design pass to re-balance it and improve the modified gameplay. In other words, cutting features introduced an additional cost to the development of the game. This made me wonder how many retail games were released in a terrible state because the development team didn't have time to re-visit the game design after features were cut to meet schedule.",1232335640

What I am about to say is as a ""devil's advocate"": I, myself, deeply interested in these issues myself, to the point that I'd never want to work in a company that doesn't deal with these issues.<p>""Wanting to work on algorithms and scaling issues"" is, ceteris parabis, a cultural issue. There's more to building a product than scalability and algorithm design: there's used experience, there's capturing requirements, there's the whole development lifecycle (testing, scoping). It may be true that people who are good at Computer Science may be <i>on average</i> more interested in algorithm design than in (say) requirements gathering or UI design -- but the converse doesn't follow (there are plenty of people who would prefer on the ""simpler"" issues of software development who are just as competent at algorithms).",1232335421

439996,comment,439298,439518,0,0,strlen,,,"> I've worked for very small companies and much larger companies than Google and I have to say that Google is a great place to work, when comparing to both and is probably the best large organization for a real , cs focused, software engineer to work for. If you love algorithms, scaling problems and the rest, you are likely to find a group where you can be pretty happy, intellectually speaking.<p>I think that gets to the core of it. I'd love to work in an environment like that (where algorithm design, cutting edge CS-focused concepts, scalability issues are the company's core competency, not a mere nuisance) - knowing I will be fully intellectually happy, irrespective of the salary.<p>Incidentally, this could also explain why there's often churn at start-ups that make it a point to recruit from places such as Google or Yahoo: you can easily build a profitable business without ever coming close to having to design your own algorithms or scale beyond a few front-end machines, a load balancer and a MySQL database (all in a single datacenter, likely through a managed hosting provider). 37signals is likely the best exemplar of that philosophy (through their posts encouraging people not to worry about scaling, database replication or building complex software).<p>In defense of the ""simpler is better"" philosophy some people would much rather work on the whole product, work together with customers/sales; some people are interested in writing code as simply as possible and find the whole idea of CS to be a nuisance (and would rather leave the issues of algorithm design and scaling to existing libraries/software packages. Some people simply wouldn't be happy taking a lower salary knowing that they could earn more elsewhere (which incidentally is a strong reason both not to <i>underpay</i> employees and also not to <i>overpay</i> employees or to give counter offers to people who found higher paying offers elsewhere).<p>Ultimately there is no perfect job: there is chance to work on unique/almost-academic/cutting edge subject matter (google can offer this, a start-up (say) making a lamp-based CRM product can't), there is a chance to get rich (start-ups are the best bet for this purpose), there is the ability to do easier work for high pay (enterprise IT).<p>You can have several of these (e.g. those who joined google when it was still a start-up both had a chance to strike it rich <i>and</i> ability to do unique and fascinating work; but they did hard work, for (usually) below-market pay) - you can't have all.",1232335103
439995,comment,439959,439959,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"Yes, kind of. I have a neat little app on the Android Market (<a href=""http://phonalyzr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phonalyzr.com</a>), which I am going to port to the Blackberry in time for their store launch. The reason I'm targeting Android and BB is because of the iPhone's ridiculously restrictive SDK - on these devices the OS notifies the user that my app will be reading their call log/contact list and the user can choose to proceed or not, whereas on the iPhone that decision has already been made for the user by someone in Apple's HQ.<p>At my day job I use python and js to do web development while this is my spare-time project and to be honest, Java isn't so bad. Yes, it's tiresomely verbose, but Eclipse and the Android plug-in are an awesome IDE and since you're dealing only with the mobile-specific SDK, you don't have to contend with issues that make Java bad in other contexts (heavy frameworks, endless XML config files, etc). Perhaps someone with experience in both can clue me in, but I doubt Objective C is less verbose or more dynamic than Java.<p>But I think you're right in that people might be missing an opportunity by focusing so heavily on the iPhone. The BB SDK is more powerful than the iPhone's, there's more than twice as many BB users than iPhone users and I don't think anyone will argue that they're any less affluent than iPhone users.<p>Mostly, I think, it'll depend on how RIM promotes the app store and the kind of deals it manages to get the carriers to accept. I worked for RIM a few years ago and saw how incredibly difficult and demanding it is to work with carriers, as they are the actual manufacturer's ""customers"" and their interests are frequently at odds with those of users.",1232335020

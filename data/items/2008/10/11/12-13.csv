Unless you're the sort of person who never looks at price tags or understands what the total should be, how would you fall for this?",1223728354

329666,comment,329448,329587,0,0,petercooper,,,"When he says Obama's plan is ""putting the cart before the horse"" I think he means that it's silly to tax us on the money we earn that we'll eventually invest with and not on the money we invest ONCE we're rich.<p>I'm not rich, but let's assume I'm on track to become so by way of my ever increasing income. Obama would take more of the income I'm using to build my fortune, leaving me less to invest later on. Lower income taxes would give me more to play with later on, and since I'll already be quite well off by then, paying tax on my capital gains doesn't really bother me.<p>Personally I don't think this is a great argument and I am in support of Obama's plan, but I do see its point. It's a very long-term argument, and I think that if far smaller investors can use the capital gains 0% tax (such as entrepreneurs who self-fund) then it's an amazing idea. But if small self-funding entrepreneurs <i>cannot</i> take advantage of the 0% tax on capital gains in their own businesses, I'd probably agree with the author as it serves only to unfairly placate the rich.",1223728053

I believe to the tune of 45% of the amount over $2 million.<p>As far as capital gains goes, they are due when you sell your capital.  In the case of PG this most likely occurred when he sold ViaWeb.  Everytime Larry and Sergey sell their GOOG stock they incur captial gains.<p>Obama is generally proposing raising the capital gains tax from 15% to 20% for anyone that earns over $250,000.  Any startup founder that has a successful exit should make a heck of a lot more then $250k.  By def an angel investor must earn $200k per year or have a net work of more than $1 million.<p>And that is why I want to see the details.",1223727991

329661,comment,329023,329105,0,0,petercooper,,,"You say that after the 1970s recession it took until 1992 for the market to make a full recovery to its inflation-adjusted peak. However, <i>the average quality of life in 1987 was far ahead of that in 1971!</i><p>Stock index levels are not indicative of quality of life, job levels, or even the financial health of a nation. Just because the Dow has fallen 40% does not mean that as a nation we are 40% worse off, unless we happened to have all of our money in the stock market.",1223727465

I try to avoid talking about certain problems with certain people because they will just focus on small seemingly unsolvable problems that don't matter much in the end.<p>My attitude has always been worry about that problem when we get there, and find a solution that is acceptable - not necessarily the one you had in mind first.<p>One line that I always try repeat to myself (especially in circuit design) is ""If the solution seems difficult, try to restate or reconfigure the problem.<p>Its like the old getting lost in the trees cliche",1223726408

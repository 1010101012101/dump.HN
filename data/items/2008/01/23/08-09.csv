102710,comment,102199,102434,0,0,andreyf,,,"But seeing examples of non-trivial algorithms makes what you once considered non-trivial, trivial. A lot of algorithm design seems to be a kind of poetry to me - where one draws on similarities to algorithms she's seen before, as a poet would draw on metaphors or imagery they've experienced elsewhere.",1201077895

Wouldn't that school then get a good reputation for graduating only ""great programmers,"" pushing any aspiring programmer to apply there--a virtuous cycle? The top schools in any field graduate the best simply because the best apply there, and the best apply there simply because ""the best"" are known to graduate from there.",1201077574

He also clearly believes that it's a bad idea.  As do I.<p>That said, I think it's totally appropriate to judge someone who makes such a foolish decision (i.e. pursuing a startup when you have no savings and little time) when children are involved.",1201076783

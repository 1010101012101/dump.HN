Each message in an exchange might itself be quite short, but the conversation itself really never ends.<p>Ask yourself what is more distracting: a long email or a series of 80 individual &quot;short, to the point&quot; texts, where each one vibrates your pocket and you have no idea when the next one is coming. You already know the answer. Often times you give up trying to do anything else and just stare at the messaging interface, waiting for the next message/fix to arrive.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I use iMessage constantly and vastly prefer texting to calling people for most trivial things.

The USG role is guaranteeing them.<p>Your information is several years out of date. Prior to July 2010, the bulk of student loans were made through the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) which were as you describe. But that program was eliminated in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Since then all Stafford, Perkins, and PLUS loans (i.e. the lion&#x27;s share of all student loans) are made directly by the federal government.<p>Only non-program student loans are no made by private banks, and they are not government guaranteed -- though they are still non-dischargeable in bankruptcy. Such loans only accounted for only around 5% of the total borrowed last year.<p>In addition, many of the loans issued privately prior to July 2010 made their way into the government&#x27;s hands during the financial crisis, so that of all outstanding student loan debt around 85% of it is currently held by the government.<p>Refs:\n<a href=""http://www.asa.org/policy/resources/stats/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asa.org/policy/resources/stats/</a>\n<a href=""http://febp.newamerica.net/background-analysis/federal-student-loan-programs-history"" rel=""nofollow"">http://febp.newamerica.net/background-analysis/federal-stude...</a>\n<a href=""http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201207_cfpb_Reports_Private-Student-Loans.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201207_cfpb_Reports_Priva...</a>",1393742993

Without that, there&#x27;s no way to determine if you&#x27;ve been MITM&#x27;d or not - that&#x27;s like the whole point of using TLS.<p>I know there are other proposals, but within the current constraints of the &quot;global PKI&quot;, there&#x27;s no alternative.<p>On a side note, for an EV cert, the CA must verify the registrant of the domain. They usually do a phone call to verify a phone number matching some other record with the name of the registrant. That takes some human effort to verify; more than an automated email. (In addition to just running a company, keeping a CA online but secure, etc.)",1393740125

7327915,comment,7325735,7327905,3,0,typicalbender,,,"That&#x27;s fair. My argument is that you shouldn&#x27;t muddy the implementation of a protocol for debugging purposes. It creates unnecessary complications that then have to be dealt with on either end in software. I think the problem that you are bringing up is more of a development environment around creating good data structures in JSON rather than a pitfall in the protocol itself.<p>I&#x27;m not saying JSON is perfect just providing a counter argument and stating a general belief I have about over complicating thing when a simple companion tool or something like CSON works just as well. CSON or CoffeeScript are good examples because they provide a more pleasurable environment for the developer but at the end up the day compile down to their native JSON or JavasScript respectively. I think we are in agreement in that I dont like the JSON5 syntax should necessarily be what&#x27;s going over the wire.",1393740005

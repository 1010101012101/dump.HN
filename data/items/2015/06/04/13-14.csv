There is no guarantee that their counterparts who stayed home are able to do the job properly<p>This is false. Many (at least 50% of H1B Indian workers) do not fall under this category.<p>To give you an example (in software): a company like Infosys would send you  average or below average consultants who are good at communicating in English. And then Infosys would charge you higher than the premium developers located in the US, while paying the worker just about average (or even minimum pay by market standards). Over a longer period of time, there are quality issues, reworks, extensions and dependability created. Now, even if a client decided to leave Infosys and hire a premium developer - it is hard and costly. Who wants to take responsibility of a bad quality thing without being given time to improve quality.<p>The rest of the 50% who are talented, they get paid well, they contribute positively to the US economy and indirectly hurt the Indian economy.",1433426396

(You get the idea..)<p>5) A slightly higher protein diet will help hold on to muscle mass while cutting this weight.<p>6) Muscle mass helps loss weight because the more of it you have the more calories your body consumes.<p>7) Some general recommendations on macros (protein = 4 calories/gram, carbs = 4 cals/gram, fat = 9 cals/gram)<p>- protein: 0.6g-0.8g/lb of body weight\n- fat: 0.4g-0.6g/lb of body weight\n- carbs: fill in the rest of your calorie allowance<p>Example for 200 lb male trying to eat 2200 calories;<p>protein: 200 x 0.8 = 160 gram | 160 x 4 cals = 640 cals<p>fat: 200 x 0.5 = 100 grams    | 100 x 9 cals = 900 cals<p>carbs: 900 cals + 640 cals = 1540 | 2200 - 1540 = 660 | 660 / 4 cals = 165 grams<p>Therefore the 200lb male will consume 2200 calories by eating 160g of protein, 100g of fat and 165g of carbs.<p>When and how these calories are consumed doesn&#x27;t really matter unless your really care about athletic performance.(1-2% to be gained maybe in meal timing and nutrient partitioning)\nSo eat how and whatever you prefer.

If we can map features (for simplicity lets think of images) to points in hamming space such that similar features have a small hamming distance then we have a fast way of finding similar images. That is the problem that this paper proposes to help with, but I could easily see this also applying to sound clips or other media, though my imagination is not that great. When I used this code I applied it to the problem of image matching using binary codes generated by a feature detector [1]. The benefit of using binary codes over traditional floating point vectors is they are much faster to compare.\n[1] <a href=""http://docs.opencv.org/modules/features2d/doc/feature_detection_and_description.html#orb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.opencv.org/modules/features2d/doc/feature_detect...</a>)",1433425753

However you dress it up, that is never going to give the ideal buying experience to all of your customers all of the time.<p>On the other hand, if you can shift the distribution mechanisms behind the scenes, you still have to deal with similar sorts of problems, but only internally. Your staff can be trained to understand and deal with the kinds of race conditions and scheduling conflicts that might arise, and they aren&#x27;t going to get upset and take their business elsewhere the way an angry customer might when those things happen.",1433425731

The tests shows that wiredtiger is indeed a bit faster for reads and writes. The neighbors of neighbors is typically a question you would ask a graph database, not a a document store. Therefore, you would set-up two databases and ask MongoDB the document questions and Neo4J the graph questions. If you use a native multi-model approach, you only need to setup, maintain one database. The response times for example for reads and shortest paths are comparable to the specialized solutions.<p>For the technical difference at storage level: graphs and documents model are in my opinion a perfect match, because a vertex (and an edge for that matter) can be stored as ordinary documents. This allows you to use any document query you have in a document (give me all users, which live in Denver) and start graph queries from the vertices found in this manner (give me their 1 and 2 level friends).",1433425626
9659187,comment,9658664,9658664,0,0,mdip,,,"This drives me absolutely bonkers. Perhaps it was my upbringing -- my dad owned his company and was the face of it (sales, marketing and &quot;doing&quot;). Being late to a customer meeting is a sure-fire way to blow a first-impression. As a result, our family was on-time or early with rare exception.<p>I look at it this way - I have a busy schedule -- 4 kids, sole provider with a software development job that directly contributes to the revenue the company I work for receives and private developer of software that my customers enjoy.  I even waited for a moment where I&#x27;m blocked to write this reply.  If I schedule personal time with a friend or family member, it&#x27;s being done at the expense of something else. I&#x27;ve decided that my time with that friend is more valuable than my core obligations.  I value that time immensely and wouldn&#x27;t want it reduced as a result of my tardiness.  When the person/couple I&#x27;m meeting with chooses to be excessively late, I assume that they didn&#x27;t really want to come at all and that they were simply being &quot;nice&quot; or fulfilling some sort of family obligation[1].<p>And it&#x27;s not limited to friendships. I owned a gym membership and I&#x27;m an early riser (5:00 AM most days).  The gym -- Bally&#x27;s at the time -- opened up at 6:00 AM according to the sign and paperwork I agreed to when I signed up for a three-year commitment.  In the first month, I showed up right at opening time only to find out that three out of the four days the opener arrived 30 minutes late.  That&#x27;s half of my workout on those days.  As a result, I was receiving 2/3 of what I was paying for -- I&#x27;m directly paying for time to access a building and its equipment.  The first month I prevented the automatic payment from processing and wrote a cheque for 2/3s of the bill along with a note explaining the situation[2].  This went over like a lead balloon.  If I received 2/3 of what I ordered at a restaurant, I would have either had it resolved or left them with the bill after explaining to the manager.<p>[1] From the opinion of someone who values punctuality and my own time: Showing up late to an event because you feel obligated to appear there is far worse than saying &quot;I can&#x27;t make it&quot; or even &quot;I have more important things to do&quot;.  I can respect that. There are certainly times when obligations related to a relationship can&#x27;t be missed -- obligations you may or may not want to go to, but think about that for a few minutes.  And what&#x27;s wrong with saying &quot;Well, that time is a little early and I have another obligation -- I&#x27;m OK with it, but could we push it a half-hour later?&quot;  If you don&#x27;t want to go, why is that? Should you, perhaps, shed yourself of that relationship if devoting time to it is resulting in you wrecking it anyway due to your tardiness?  Are you too passive to simply assert yourself with that person? Is there some way you could suggest to change that event to invoke the necessary willpower to show up somewhere near the time you&#x27;re expected?  Are you too selfish in thinking that your attendance is so important that you can just show up whenever you want -- despite everyone elses&#x27; schedules?<p>[2] I ended up successfully breaking the contract after filing a small claims action (that would have never been won).",1433425625

Our current diet is a nightmare in terms of not just weight, but health in general, more specifically, the rise in auto-immune disease. Research shows that a leaky gut is a _prerequisite_ (but not only factor) for developing auto-immune disease. One thing that causes leaky gut is gluten. Grains and seeds contain stuff that hurts your gut, why? Because grains and seeds have developed a defence for digestion because they need to come out the other side. I&#x27;m not a fad-following hipster, I just read literature on this, and I&#x27;ve seen first hand what gluten does to someone who&#x27;s not even gluten intolerant. My wife has Grave&#x27;s disease which is auto-immune. Her options were taking meds that devastate the thyroid and liver, or operate her thyroid and in the process likely develop the opposite of Grave&#x27;s: hypothyroidism. She tried every other option, including different kinds of diets, until we read about the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP), which is a strict version of the Paleo diet. Her symptoms (constant 100-120 bbm heartbeat) went away within days. We&#x27;ve pinned it down to gluten as the main factor.<p>Counting calories is an extremely simplistic world view, and while it&#x27;s very comforting to have a simple rule to follow, I believe it&#x27;s a very bad idea to not care what you put in your body, as opposed to just how much of it.",1433424786

There are a great many foods which can have substantial short-term effects on blood sugar well outside the range that the body has the capability to process effectively.<p>This is a classic example of an underdamped control system leading to oscillations.  It happens because the bandwidth of the control system isn&#x27;t sufficient for the bandwidth of the input.  As an engineer if I faced this problem I typically would try and increase the bandwidth of the control system to solve the problem.  But that&#x27;s not really an option in the human body (yet) so the only real solution is to try and control the bandwidth of the input.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system#/media/File:Second_order_transfer_function.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system#/media/File:Seco...</a><p>The more you control the input bandwidth (excess sugars) the less you&#x27;re going to end up with oscillations and I suspect that those oscillations are what help people really put on weight.  Eat too much sugar, it gets stored into fat and a sugar crash.  That sugar crash presents as &quot;false&quot; hunger, so you eat again.  Probably you eat too much sugar again, and so the cycle repeats.<p>There&#x27;s probably a lot of variation from human to human on the insulin control system bandwidth, and there&#x27;s a lot of variation in the diet different people choose to eat.  So if one person has high bandwidth and generally good diet, perhaps it only makes a difference like you&#x27;ve suggested.

No discussion here.<p>- &#x27;knowledge of necessity&#x27;: when the crime is not something you intended to do, but you knew that it would happen if you did something to get to another object. The text book example of this is a ship owner who wanted to collect the insurance money for his ship, so he sank it; the crew drowned. He didn&#x27;t &#x27;intent&#x27; to kill the crew, it was just a side effect of his actions in sinking the ship (he knew they were on it).<p>- &#x27;conditional intent&#x27;, in many US jurisdictions aka &#x27;willfull blindness&#x27;: this one is the fuzziest. It&#x27;s when you knowingly and willingly took the chance that someone would die (or other crime would happen). Text book example: &#x27;eggshell skull&#x27; (Wikipedia has a whole page; in short: guy throws a slipper at wife&#x27;s head, wife has a medical condition that causes her to have a skull that is literally as thick (and fragile) as an eggshell; guy didn&#x27;t know; slipper breaks skull, killing wife - still murder).<p>(I&#x27;m not interested in discussion on legal technicalities like the nuances of tort law under various legal regimes and mens rea as a precondition for qualification as murder)<p>So, to come back to the point: people who are chronically late <i>know</i> that they are late. They <i>could</i> do something about it; like adding extra time to their estimates of home long things take, or not doing certain things when they know they&#x27;re late already (like the &#x27;getting coffee&#x27; mentioned in the GP, that infuriates me - my wife does it too, making me go through customs with a screaming toddler and 20kg suitcase in one hand, and coffee in the other once, but I digress).

The only thing that slows you down getting across town are red lights and stop signs. That&#x27;s it. Even in large cities &quot;known&quot; for horrible traffic conditions, I&#x27;ve been able to get across the entire city in a reasonable amount of time fairly consistently.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s trivial to be punctual. And so punctuality is taken as a sign of respect.<p>On the West Coast, this isn&#x27;t the case. It can <i>literally</i> take 45 minutes to an 1 1/2 hours to get 5 miles in L.A. by car. And that&#x27;s during <i>normal</i> traffic conditions. If absolutely anything happens on that route, you could walk faster. In fact, my wife and I have done just that on a 5 mile commute in L.A. when traffic would lock up. Park the car, get out, and walk. Take the early bus and pick it back up in the morning.<p>Let that sink in for a bit. You&#x27;ve got a meeting. It&#x27;s only 5 (or god forbid 10) miles  away. Anything even slightly irregular happens, and it could take you hours to get there.<p>Starts making &quot;minor&quot; delays of 5 to 10 minutes or even 30 seem pretty trivial. Cancelations happen much more frequently. Sorry, buddy, someone had a flat. Can&#x27;t make it today or it&#x27;ll take me 3 hours to get there.<p>That&#x27;s why out east, companies would dock workers if they clocked in 5m late. Out West work hours are more like &quot;ohhh, sometime between 8:30 and 9:30 is when so-and-so shows up.&quot; It&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re lazy or inconsiderate or rude.

That units-limit was something I did not particularly enjoyed in those games (and appreciated instead games like Command & Conquer in this regard). I agree that there is more than technical features that make or break a game, but the units-limit in RT tactics games is a flaw and it&#x27;s not a technical one.<p>For those who argue that units-limit encouraged unit-quality over unit-quantity thinking, I concede. It&#x27;s a valid point that perhaps contributed to the *Craft success series.

The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it&#x27;s very brightly colored, and it&#x27;s very loud, and it&#x27;s fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, &quot;Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?&quot; And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, &quot;Hey, don&#x27;t worry; don&#x27;t be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.&quot; And we … kill those people. &quot;Shut him up! I&#x27;ve got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.&quot; It&#x27;s just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it doesn&#x27;t matter, because it&#x27;s just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It&#x27;s only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here&#x27;s what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride.

That&#x27;s not too tricky (though you need Special Relativity to deal with why that&#x27;s true even if you are moving very very fast, to explain why light inside your box still seems to go the same speed in all directions).<p>My issue with the article is that it agrees with that but then claims people are disturbed by small accelerations - and my contention is that you <i>also</i> can&#x27;t detect small constant accelerations. As another poster wrote, a small constant linear acceleration is indistinguishable from the floor being slightly angled.<p>If you get back in your sealed train carriage and I accelerate it very gently forwards, you can&#x27;t actually tell whether you are accelerating or simply at a slight angle. A small enough acceleration might not be noticed at all, just as a small angle of the floor would also go unnoticed. But if I <i>change</i> the acceleration - stop accelerating you or increase the acceleration - you will notice. It might be perceived as motion or the carriage rotating but it will be perceived.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not making the strong claim that you can&#x27;t tell there is a net force acting on you. I&#x27;m only making the claim that you can&#x27;t tell the difference between an accelerating force and being stationary in a gravitational field. And I&#x27;m claiming that when the net acceleration is close to 1g, your body can&#x27;t tell at all that there is anything other than gravity acting on you. Higher g&#x27;s are of course readily attributed to movement.<p>Obviously when a building sways, though, the acceleration is <i>changing</i>, switching between + and - a fraction of a g, not constant. And it&#x27;s my contention that it is the changing acceleration - the presence of &#x27;jerk&#x27; - that people detect and react to, precisely because the accelerations involved are too small to be perceived directly. You feel like you must be accelerating (or the floor must be tipping) because you perceive a change in the net acceleration you feel - a change in the direction you sense as down. You feel the jerk not the acceleration itself.",1433423332

Eating 6 times a day is also seeing some push back as to whether it is really any healthier. Calorie counting not being important was a fad (if its possible to have a negative fad). How can you have an ideal macro split for a diet when each of those macros has a calorie value without also taking into account your overall calorie needs?<p>It may become more prevalent that the notion of eating consistently will change too. You cannot eat at a deficit for any period of time without getting pretty severe diminishing returns as your body adapts to its in vs out. 5:2 is a very simple model of calorie cycling, just an unsustainable on.<p>Protein and calories have the same calorie content per gram, so if you hit your protein macros then there is no downside to eating carbs, and actually for active people your gains and recovery will suffer dramatically from lack of carbs. Overloading on protein has the same downsides as overloading on carbs in simple calories in vs out terms.<p>I think it&#x27;s fairly common knowledge now that fats are largely good (saturated fats help with testosterone regulation for example) even though food producers seem to be wilfully slow in catching up (low fat items being filled with sugar thus making them far more unhealthy).<p>I&#x27;m not sure I entirely buy into the if it fits your macros (IIFYM) way of thinking, but it&#x27;s not a bad strategy for a lot of situations.",1433423204

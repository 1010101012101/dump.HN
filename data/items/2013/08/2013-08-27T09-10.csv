6282466,comment,6277955,6278761,3,0,winter_blue,,,"> <i>It&#x27;s not hard at all to rack up a couple of million dollars in hospital bills if you get unlucky, and you&#x27;d probably never be able to pay that back.</i><p>Just go to another country, if you need quality no-hassle healthcare.<p><i>pg</i> says in one his essays, that he found after cashing in on Viaweb that he couldn&#x27;t just walk into a hospital and swipe his card. It just doesn&#x27;t work like that in America. You need insurance, even if you have 50 mil in your bank.<p>To top it off, individual health care is very expensive and designed to screw you (and since you&#x27;re not a big company with hundreds of people signed up, you can&#x27;t threaten to switch or do any other such sort of thing if they deny you care.) I know someone who needed a very expensive procedure, and his boss basically told the insurance company that if they didn&#x27;t assent to the procedure, his company would switch to some other provider. As a lone individual, you have less of this kind of leverage.<p>Now, most other countries (I said <i>most</i>) don&#x27;t work like that. You can go to any hospital, not have to worry about denials and pay in proportion to the service they render to you. And their fees come nowhere close to what the most U.S. hospitals charge.<p>As for options, based on my personal experience:<p>- If you want to go really cheap, choose India. India has a great medical system, but the generally unsanitary state of the country gives me doubts about the hygiene even in hospitals.<p>- If you are not seriously cash-strapped, try the UAE. They have a lot of really good hospitals, latest technology, and everything just gleams and shines there. For an example of pricing: laparoscopic surgery at premier specialty hospital in the UAE costs about $10k. I assume it&#x27;d be in the $50k (or more) in the US. (Au contraire, in India it&#x27;s probably $1-$2k range.)",1377597492

It still applies to offline hashes.<p>That means, if your db is compromised, it&#x27;s pretty much game over for your users (who will invariably reuse them elsewhere) if you used simple hashes - another key takeaway. Bcrypt (or better yet, scrypt) is still the better option for this very reason.<p>Edit: To clarify, it doesn&#x27;t matter that you limit logins, lockout users after failed login attempts etc...

6282464,comment,6281306,6282141,2,0,antimagic,,,"Exactly.  Just with all other good writing, you have to show, not tell.  Those ads with people talking on Facetime for example were great - they showed how Apple&#x27;s products made life nicer without actually saying &quot;see how your life will be nicer&quot;.  These new ads unfortunately go the other way.<p>Now that can still be OK.  If for example Apple is actually trying to change the discourse about how people judge devices - &quot;don&#x27;t judge devices by how much they cost, or their spec sheet, judge them about how much they improve your life&quot; then an occassional ad that explicitly makes people think about things in that way can be effective.  It&#x27;s not about selling an iPhone, it&#x27;s about getting people to think about these issues when they are in the shop buying a phone, rather than simply just opting for the cheapest phone they salesperson shows them.<p>Still, it grates.  I think they could have got that message across without explicitly stating the message.",1377597448

It&#x27;s too easy to clobber the selection clipboard. It also affect usability on basic things like copying something from the terminal to paste into a browser&#x27;s search box. Naturally, you want to delete the existing contents of the search box, but selecting it all to delete it clobbers the very thing you want to paste.<p>The setup I have on Windows with Cygwin and mintty is my preference. There is only one clipboard, and normal GUI selections don&#x27;t have any affect on it. However, selection in the terminal copies into the clipboard, and middle-click in the terminal pastes the clipboard. Combine that with keyboard shortcuts for pasting the clipboard in the terminal, and a couple of command-line scripts (I call mine &#x27;c&#x27; and &#x27;p&#x27;) for using copy and paste with pipes, and everything works pretty smoothly.<p>As it is on Linux, my &#x27;c&#x27; reads stdin and stuffs it into both primary and clipboard buffers, while my &#x27;p&#x27; takes an argument &#x27;s&#x27; to print out the primary buffer, otherwise it prints out the clipboard buffer. It&#x27;s a pain when you end up pasting the wrong thing. Meanwhile, middle-click in UI apps is very rarely used because (a) it requires too much precision in aim - the text usually ends up exactly where you middle-click, rather than the current position of the cursor - and (b), I usually want paste to replace a selection, but the act of selection clobbers what I&#x27;m trying to paste...",1377595191

6282346,comment,6279241,6280817,2,0,klibertp,,,"> PHP doesn&#x27;t have deep pattern matching, because PHP is not Haskell :) But it has destructuring matching for arrays, and that&#x27;s what list() is doing.<p>Yes, the problem is that it&#x27;s not generic, it&#x27;s only for arrays, and for the ones with numerical indexes (?) only. When introducing a special syntax for destructuring, why not make it possible to destructure other kinds of data, like hash tables? It&#x27;s one-off special case instead of a generic language feature. In CoffeeScript you can destructure objects as well as arrays, so it&#x27;s possible for languages other than Haskell. In both in CS and Python destructuring can be used in any position assigment can, including functions formal arguments lists and (in Python) exception handlers. That&#x27;s a consistent usage of language feature; a &#x27;list&#x27; keyword is a hack. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not convenient to have or that it should have some special syntax instead of a keyword - not at all - just saying that it should be consistently used in the language and well supported by it.<p>> Because they are absolutely and completely different things. Iterators are sequential-access abstraction, arrays are random-access abstraction. Why wouldn&#x27;t there be a difference?<p>But arrays do offer sequential access. The question is this: if both arrays and iterators offer (parts of) the same functionality, why is access to this functionality not uniform? What I&#x27;m talking about is this:<p>&quot;OO brings with it an iterator interface that parts of the language (e.g., for...as) respect, but nothing built-in (like arrays) actually implements the interface. If you want an array iterator, you have to wrap it in an ArrayIterator. There are no built-in ways to chain or slice or otherwise work with iterators as first-class objects.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s still the case? If it is, then it&#x27;s another inconsistency which shouldn&#x27;t be there.<p>> Those are not design problems, those are &quot;everything should look exactly like one language I already learned&quot; problems.<p>I agree that most of the criticism is either unfounded or comes from novice programmers. Novice programmers tend to be loyal to their language of choice to the point of not seeing good points of other languages. I think that most of experienced programmers, however, are already past this stage, with many known languages they can compare and contrast PHP with. It needs to be a fair comparison - I&#x27;m not trying to compare PHP with for example strongly staticly typed, functional or concurrent languages. But PHP is a dynamic, scripting language and as such comparing it with Ruby, Python, JavaScript and CoffeeScript, Lua, Perl, Scheme, Clojure, Io, Smalltalk and a few others <i>is</i> feasible. And it&#x27;s not favorable for PHP, unless we count extra-language features, like community, libraries, ease of deployment and so on. I accept that, with these things in mind, PHP comes like a solid choice and a good language. Based on a in-language features, however, not so much.",1377594772

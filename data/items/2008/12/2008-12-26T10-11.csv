And he's talking about how it got there <i>when it did</i>, not today.  I don't necessarily agree, but what he was saying should have been pretty obvious. :)",1230288222
410102,comment,410080,410090,0,0,gaius,,,"The problem with graduates in the Western world is: there are too many of us already. Even in the ""hard"" disciplines of science and engineering, there are too few jobs. How many physics graduates go on to become full-time physicists? How many of all graduates go onto jobs where they need what they learnt in undergrad? Not many.<p>Meanwhile, try finding a plumber or an electrician... Our physical infrastructure is quite literally crumbling around us while our heads are in the clouds.",1230288180
410101,comment,409562,409753,0,0,h34t,,,"My first business was designed with two purposes: to earn a profit, and to support artisans in developing countries. Was it a business or a charity? Well, its legal structure was 'business' but its purpose was not only to earn a profit for me. I would consider it a failure if it had only helped myself, because that was not why I started it.<p>So I don't care whether you call it a charity or business. What is important is clearly understanding your purposes and means and making damn sure you communicate them well to the people who matter for your success.<p>The important realization I had was that it doesn't matter what traditional expectations are. As long as I stayed within the law, my limits were simply defined by the agreements I could make -- with artisans, with customers, and with all the other players in-between.<p>Later on I went to university, and that was the first place I was confronted with this inane idea that it was a structural necessity for a business to be driven solely by profit, etc. etc. -- as if this was an immutable law which transcends human nature and society.<p>I didn't get into business only to live up to expectations that society has created, as though I was a gas waiting to expand to fill whatever chamber I was put into. I got into business as a way to express myself through thought and action in whatever ways might lead to the most impact.",1230288106

Let me change this a bit.<p>Imagine you are made president of a 3rd world country which has not yet industrialized. You are now tasked with making this country actually rich. Where would you put the government money in?<p>If you say you would equally create service and manufacturing industries, then your country would collapse quickly. The correct thing to do is to create goods that can be exported, or that have some use within the country itself. The other industries always develop themselves, because they are a sort of grease for the core industries.<p>Allocation of time and money is not done by bankers. It's done by managers and owners, the bankers just approve or disapprove loans.",1230287316

I have lived this story.  The only ones America has to blame are themselves.  China has its own set of problems.  They didn't setup a global conspiracy to achieve their current position.  China simply took advantage of horrifically bad U.S. management and took care of their own country.  U.S. business and government leadership were always the front runners in ""enabling"" this relationship.  If you want to start a mob frenzy, do it on Wall Street.",1230287012

And I like education, sort of.<p>But it's bad enough that drop out rates are >50% for engineers in the US.  You think you're going to figure out how to teach it to younger students if you can't even understand why half of everyone loses interest in higher education?<p>I have a hint: don't take Vannevar Bush so damn seriously.  Yes, math + science + analysis == good.  Especially when most of our CS and engineering programs were designed during the Cold War.  But we also got rid of our practice and drawing coursework.<p>I'm not buying the iPhone because it's the ""best engineered device.""  Somewhere along the lines, our engineers forgot what the hell art, design, and usability was.  It's one of those things you don't want to take to the extreme.  People wonder why the CS jobs go to India, it's because CS is not difficult.  Creativity and innovation is, I don't see many companies outsourcing that (ok I realize I just made a really vague generalization, but if you look into my comment history, I do go into more detail).<p>I will say that it's extremely rare to find the guy who can not only code, but design too.  I have only met a few in my life, and they're always the most respected people at a company who are incidentally the most desirable to all the others.",1230286466

Feeling good is a by-product of giving, but only because you've done something worthwhile (or so you believe).<p>That people bitch about CEO compensation doesn't mean they don't want to improve the world. They bitch <i>because</i> they want to improve the world, and they believe that high CEO compensation (as they perceive it) is a modern evil that stands in the way of improvement.",1230286386

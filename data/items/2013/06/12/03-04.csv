Hegemony, distinct from coercion, is the production of &quot;spontaneous consent&quot; for the policies of the &quot;ruling class&quot; through the means of civil society, intellectuals, and culture.  By shaping how people perceive their interests, there&#x27;s no need to coerce behaviors or acceptance of policies.",1371009566

We&#x27;re at a point where flat is simply the present zeitgeist of UI design.<p>However, &#x27;flat&#x27; largely covers superficial aspects of design.

The examples he gives are specifically the kinds of things that there are social solutions to - eg making it Not Socially Acceptable to wear mobile face recognition systems around in public.<p>If you&#x27;re going to devolve into a DDR-style police state, there&#x27;s very little technically that can prevent that from happening.  What can happen is that you force an enormous investment of resources to maintain it, instead of giving the ability to a tiny cabal.  If you&#x27;re forcing the recruitment of a demographically significantly portion of the population (somewhere 2.5% to 7% in the case of the Stasi) in order to maintain the security apparatus, there&#x27;s much more room for debate over whether to build it or dismantle it than if it just requires a few billion dollars and a fistful of NSLs.",1371009523

Use Auto Layout to help your app respond when layout changes are required.”<p>Now, I may be reading too much into this, but the use of the word ‘when’ sounds to me like Apple is preparing products with other resolutions than are on the current iOS devices. I think there would be a market for a budget iPhone with a smaller screen, and a high-end iPad with a larger screen.<p>Also, the icon size for apps is different in iOS 7. It’s going up from 114x114 to 120x120.<p>[1] <a href=""http://es.slideshare.net/evgenybelyaev16/transition-guide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://es.slideshare.net/evgenybelyaev16/transition-guide</a>",1371009080

5866404,comment,5866004,5866004,15,0,LowKarmaAccount,,,"There are some theories that fall into a third category of &quot;unlikely, hard to prove, probably false but intensely fascinating.&quot; A good example is Julian Jaynes&#x27;s <i>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</i> [1], which Richard Dawkins describes as:<p>&quot;A book that is as strange as its title suggests. It is one of those books that is either complete rubbish or a work of consummate genius, nothing in between! Probably the former, but I&#x27;m hedging my bets.&quot;[2]<p>By the way, the Wikipedia page about Jaynes&#x27; book uses part of that quotation, but cuts off the last sentence.<p>Dawkins provides a good summary of the book:<p>&quot;Jaynes notes that many people perceive their own thought\nprocesses as a kind of dialogue between the &#x27;self and another internal protagonist inside the head. Nowadays we understand that both &#x27;voices&#x27; are our own - or if we don&#x27;t we are treated as mentally ill...<p>&quot;Jaynes&#x27;s suggestion is that some time before 1000 BC people in\ngeneral were unaware that the second voice - the Gilbert\nPinfold voice - came from within themselves. They thought\nthe Pinfold voice was a god: Apollo, say, or Astarte or Yahweh or,\nmore probably, a minor household god, offering them advice or\norders. Jaynes even located the voices of the gods in the opposite\nhemisphere of the brain from the one that controls audible\nspeech. The &#x27;breakdown of the bicameral&#x27; mind was, for Jaynes, a\nhistorical transition. It was the moment in history when it dawned\non people that the external voices that they seemed to be hearing\nwere really internal. Jaynes even goes so far as to define this\nhistorical transition as the dawning of human consciousness.\nThere is an ancient Egyptian inscription about the creator god\nPtah, which describes the various other gods as variations of Ptah&#x27;s\n&#x27;voice&#x27; or &#x27;tongue&#x27;. Modern translations reject the literal &#x27;voice&#x27; and\ninterpret the other gods as &#x27;objectified conceptions of [Ptah&#x27;s]\nmind&#x27;. Jaynes dismisses such educated readings, preferring to take\nthe literal meaning seriously. The gods were hallucinated voices,\nspeaking inside people&#x27;s heads. Jaynes further suggests that such\ngods evolved from memories of dead kings, who still, in a manner\nof speaking, retained control over their subjects via imagined voices\nin their heads.

Google is further improving this by extracting many of the super useful APIs out into a version-agnostic package that is updated independent of carrier say-so. Your API level 10 apps will run quite happily on Gingerbread, Honeycomb, and JB devices. Furthermore, Google supports multiple APK deployments, so you can actually build your application with different features for different API levels, and publish them under the same entry in the Play store; each device is routed to the proper APK.<p>However, despite all of this, you are talking about the exact same thing that Marco is.

This is a beta, not a Google &quot;let&#x27;s call it beta even though it&#x27;s actually finished&quot;. A real beta. With plenty of bugs; occasional crashes. Lots of graphics glitches esp. when using 3rd party apps. Seems to use tons of battery.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand what a beta is, better don&#x27;t install this. Beta means buggy.<p>But as far as the UI is concerned, it&#x27;s fantastic. It&#x27;s beyond that - it feels as if a great weight has been lifted from iOS and I can feel the blood, sweat, and tears, as well as enthusiasm and sheer euphoria, of the people putting this together in an insane timeframe. 7 months!<p>Sure there&#x27;s inconsistencies in the design - those will get fixed over time, probably before the GM; there&#x27;s so many glitches - I expect some will remain past GM. There&#x27;s some weirdness that&#x27;ll only get fixed next year.<p>But all in all, this is one fantastic update. This is Apple at its best. If you can&#x27;t see that, I feel sorry for you, but I also feel confident that you will see it in hindsight, next year, when everyone will talk about how Apple re-invented itself yet again with iOS7.<p>Samsung meanwhile is already hard at work copying all those features, expect them to pop up in Android within the next 6 months.

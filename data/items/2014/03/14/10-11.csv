And all you&#x27;ve shown is that the price impact of a whale dumping stock is now felt by the whale, not by the other players in the market.<p>I.e., before the big player decided to liquidate the natural price was X. After they decided to liquidate the natural price is Y < X. The market will move from X to Y, it&#x27;s only a matter of when. If the whale sells at X, the other players eat the loss. If HFTs predate on the whale, the HFTs gain, other players take less of a loss, and the whale eats more of the loss.<p>Why is this bad? Is it somehow a desirable feature of the markets that Goldman can dump 1M shares of AAPL and the rest of us are supposed to eat the price impact?<p>Also, predation is unlikely to be affected by an FTT.

7397878,comment,7397269,7397843,2,0,crdoconnor,,,">Can you explain the mechanics of this &quot;skimming&quot; and explain how a transaction tax would prevent it? Detailed mechanics please, not vague talking points or meaningless nanex graphs.<p>Here:<p>A classic aggressive strategy involves hunting and trapping “whales.” It is a good example of aggressive HFT strategy.<p>It is initiated by a “pinging” operation. This involves placing multiple orders designed to detect the presence of a market participant with a large position that it is in the process of accumulating or liquidating. “High frequency traders employ pattern recognition software to detect large institutional orders sitting in dark pools or other liquidity venues.”41 When it pings, the algorithmic trader places orders to buy and/or sell in an array of prices inside the bid/ask spread. If the potential target market participant starts walking through the orders, it becomes clear that a large position is in play that could consume all of the liquidity on one side of the market (bid or ask). Traders sometimes refer to the potential target as a “whale.” Often, a whale intends to buy or sell a large block for structural reasons and is relatively less sensitive to price than other buyers and sellers. If the trader’s order strategy reveals price insensitivity, the whale becomes a target.<p>For example, an investment fund might have experienced large redemptions from its investors that require liquidation of investments under the terms of the fund. The fund is compelled to sell promptly and is relatively insensitive to price. It is a properly motivated whale.<p>Once a whale is sighted and its price insensitivity is confirmed, it becomes clear that dominating the other side of the market will give the algorithmic trader control of the bid/ask pricing mechanism. In our example, the algorithmic trader would meet the offers of all of the bidders for the shares that the whale seeks to sell, becoming the sole and dominant purchaser in the marketplace. The algorithmic trader establishes a narrow band of absolute market power controlling the particular securities or derivatives that the whale seeks to buy or sell. The whale will be compelled to either abandon the market or transact at the price demanded by the algorithmic trader.<p>In an instant, the algorithmic trader cancels all “pinging” orders and buys the market in order to extract as much value as possible. It will also likely flood the trading venue with orders to create congestion and slow other market participants who are also watching and might intervene. The whale must transact at the price required by the algorithmic trader to accumulate or liquidate the position, as appropriate. When the transaction with the whale is accomplished, the quote stuffing orders are all cancelled.<p>In the final step, the algorithmic trader liquidates the position acquired from the whale immediately, but at a new bid/ask spread reestablished at market levels that are more competitive. The algorithmic trader intends that its profit from moving the bid/ask spread to take advantage of the whale’s price insensitive motivation will exceed the potential loss from the operation if the whale detects that it is being taken advantage of. For this reason, the strategy is most useful if all of the steps can be executed quickly, before detection is possible.<p>By displacing the entire side of a bid/ask spread, the HFT eliminates all meaningful depth of buying or selling interest for a short time period. As a result, the observed spread in the market is meaningless. Various studies that examine the narrowing of bid ask spreads in the modern marketplace miss the crucial point that HFT tactics like the one described are missing the point that the narrowing is an illusion.42 If the study draws the conclusion that HFT narrows spreads, it is simply misleading.<p>(From: <a href=""http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/03/yes-virginia-hft-and-liquidity-are-not-all-they-are-cracked-up-to-be.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/03/yes-virginia-hft-and-...</a>)<p>N.B.

Typically all destructive modification of the schema is done in several passes: eg. in each release/deploy:<p># copy the data in a new table and add code to place it in both tables<p># change the code to reference only the new data but still store it in both tables<p># rename the old table<p># remove the old table<p>On top of that you have changes that are supposed to be applied before the new code is deployed (eg. creating a table, renaming a table) and after the code is deployed (eg. dropping unused columns).<p>As somebody else mentions in the comments this is more about Change Control than Versioning, but the two things go together to insure that you have as much idempotent and reversible changes as possible. Of course, if you have the resources you can always adopt a &quot;never delete data&quot; policy, so you&#x27;re always copying instead of modifying the data, making sure you have a way to retract the changes. Clean-up can be done on regular, distant intervals.<p>Using ORM doesn&#x27;t prevent you from doing a review on the changes that are about to be implemented.

Usually the ORM schema changes are executed automatically by your CI upon deployment on Dev, QA and possibly Staging environments (you do have at least two of those, don&#x27;t you? :) and need manual intervention (maybe to control performance degradation of your live env - locks, increased disk I/O, etc).

Why would you trade for a margin less than the tax you have to pay?<p>Because you think the asset is going to increase in value in the future, of course!<p>You might find the article&#x27;s argument compelling if you are an arbitrageur.  The firms spending millions on microwave antennas to trade a few milliseconds sooner might be frustrated that transactions with puny spreads are no longer profitable, due to a .03% tax.<p>But we (society) swallow far more than that in other markets.

And these tax rates are four orders of magnitude higher than the proposed FTT!<p>People buying and selling financial instruments is not four orders of magnitude more important to the economy than is labor, or buying goods. If anything, it&#x27;s much less important. So I don&#x27;t see why financial instruments should enjoy a privileged tax status.<p>> Thus all of the revenue from the tax (and as I point out in that paper, this will be less than the revenue lost from other taxes as a result of the introduction of the FTT) will have its burden, and more, upon end investors.<p>How?

That is not volatility. Or a flash crash. That is a CRASH crash.<p>Wanna know how long it took for prices to rise again after the flash crash? 15 minutes. THAT&#x27;S volatility. One year?

That doesn&#x27;t change anything about its fundamental nature, however.<p>>As for your comments that HFT is not driving down spreads, there are plenty of evidence that they do.

They&#x27;re not cutting down on spreads (that&#x27;s what market makers do - and HFT is NOT market making).<p>Can we start distinguishing technology from strategies? HFT is the technology of inserting/amending/deleting orders extremely quickly in an exchange. There are many different financial institutions that use this with different strategies. Some are good, some are not so good. Market Makers almost all use HFT, they have to provide the best prices and update them as fast as possible when market conditions change to stay competitive. (Spacial) arbitrage is another strategy that requires HFT and is important to make markets more efficient.<p>> HFT is basically legalized front running.<p>Again, there are no relation between front running and HFT. Front running applies to brockers that use knowledge of their client&#x27;s investments to make money for themselves. They might do that with or without HFT. Acting faster than a competitor on price change is not front running.",1394792587

7397803,comment,7394879,7395777,1,0,vlasev,,,"Speed reading is like speed sex... Choose between 1 hour with 1 person or 1 minute with 60 people? Okay I get that you might prefer 20 minutes with 3 people and that&#x27;s fair.<p>Everyone can learn to read faster and everyone can claim to understand what they read. However, is that all there is to reading? There are things like imagery, sounds, feelings, etc and they can be invaluable both for the enjoyment axis and for the comprehension axis. Not to mention that I couldn&#x27;t care less about your comprehension 5 minutes after the fact. Come back to me in a week and tell me how much you remember.<p>But let&#x27;s look at these often forgotten parts of reading!<p>Imagery. IRL you can become over-whelmed by visual stimuli. This means there&#x27;s a limited bandwidth there. Since we&#x27;re mostly visual creatures there&#x27;s a lot of bandwidth there but it&#x27;s still quite finite(If you want convincing participate in one of those visual research experiments). When you read faster, you should expect more of this bandwidth to be taken up. As a consequence your brain will take shortcuts to minimize load and stress. It may feel like you&#x27;re seeing it all but you probably aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s the fast system of your brain working. The slow part of your system is taking a vacation.<p>Yes, you can improve your temporal resolution but not by much. Sounds are a lot like imagery.<p>Emotions. We are bio-chemical systems and there&#x27;s a time scale over which emotions happen. They won&#x27;t take place any faster. If you are like me and you care about emotions when reading, you will slow down (All I get from speed-reading is a fast-beating heart and stress quite like the stress in one of those visual labs).<p>Consider this. Emotions are very important for long-term memory (which is probably the most important part of reading some kind of technical text). By reading very fast you are cutting your emotions short if they happen at all. You effectively average out your emotions. It might not feel like it because you are still experiencing the peaks and valleys but they are smaller and you&#x27;ll never know it. Memories are formed better when the emotions are stronger.<p>Speed-reading is just another phenomenon in a series of maximizations along one dimension by disregarding full the effects it has the other dimensions. Other phenomenons are known as texting, facebooking, etc. Okay, these kinds of things have their place but the more we do them, the easier it is to let them take over our lives. Our brains are not designed that way. I just find it hard to justify calling it &quot;I read x wps&quot; when it&#x27;s more so &quot;I lossy-scan the page and get the jist of it while stressing over my speed&quot;.",1394792049

7397786,comment,7394879,7394879,2,0,mbrock,,,"I have to defend speed reading. It is in fact highly useful, and I will claim that it can even aid comprehension.<p>I have two examples.<p>(1) Last night I went to a meetup to discuss a certain topic related to religion, atheism, and a certain idea explained by Alain de Botton. So I decided to check out his book about it.<p>I grabbed my notebook, bought the book on Kindle, and skimmed it in 30 minutes, making notes of what struck me as interesting fodder for discussion. It&#x27;s a pretty short and breezy book, so this was quite enjoyable.<p>Then I realized that Erich Fromm probably has something to say about this, so I googled a bit and found that he wrote a book about &quot;Religion and Psychoanalysis,&quot; which seemed highly relevant from the preview. So I did the same thing with that.<p>Before the event I had dinner while looking through my notes and thinking about it. This all enabled me to be decently prepared, get a good start on the material, bring some quotes to the table, and so on.<p>(2) I do a weekly blog series about museum visits, for fun and to practice my writing. Sometimes I&#x27;m pretty clueless about the topic at hand, so in order to keep the blog from becoming totally vague and uninteresting, I skim a book or two. This lets me engage with the museum stuff in a more interesting way. For example last weekend I skimmed Deleuze&#x27;s book about Francis Bacon, and found a couple of great ideas to build on.<p>So why would I say that speed reading can aid comprehension? Basically, books are tedious. I mean, how many books do you own that you haven&#x27;t gotten through or even started? Speed reading, especially in combination with note taking, is a way to start engaging with material without investing a huge amount of time and attention, which are extremely scarce resources for a full time worker.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s better than nothing. But I also really feel like the sheer velocity of speed reading or skimming helps me somehow. I don&#x27;t get stuck as easily. I don&#x27;t feel the obsessive need to &quot;grok&quot; everything. I don&#x27;t get bogged down.<p>Of course this is a staple technique for people in academia, and you don&#x27;t really need any special tools for it. E-book highlighting can be very useful, but manual note taking works great too.",1394791657

The Chicago Manual of Style (which is for book editing) prescribes &#x27;s, while the AP Stylebook and Libel Manual (for press, naturally) prescribes &#x27; only.<p>So since it&#x27;s an American news site and follows AP guidelines, the title is perfectly normal.

It&#x27;s about preventing HFT operators from effectively levying a tax on the rest of the participants in the equities market (e.g. pensions and value investors).<p>Actually no. HFT drive down the costs for pensions and value investors. The ones that foot the bill is the traders and the market makers that have seen their margins collapse.<p>> This can be seen in HFT by looking at the flash crash. Volatility gone nuts. Did that ever happen before HFT?<p>Indeed it did. There was a flash crash in 1962 as well. The reason was similar - suddenly the market found they were out of buyers.<p>> The profits that HFT firms make have to come from SOMEwhere, correct?<p>Sure, but there are plenty of other players in the market that traditionally have been able to shave a lot more from investors.<p>As for your comments that HFT is not driving down spreads, there are <i>plenty</i> of evidence that they do. Spreads have collapsed to nothing in the 15-20 years of operating HFTs.<p>Mandatory reading: <a href=""http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2012/hft_apology.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2012/hft_apology.html</a> Don&#x27;t miss part 2 and 3.",1394791508

Not <i>all</i> Russian language news were outlawed. Instead, only Russian TV channels were banned in Ukraine a few days ago. This has caused OSCE to express concern. See the link below.<p>Almost a half of Ukrainians speak Russian language. New Kiev government has banned national broadcasts in this language, effectively denying its people access to information.<p>When we hear the arguments that banning Russian-language press/TV in Ukraine is OK, since those are necessarily &#x27;Putin propaganda&#x27;, but banning radical sites[1] in Russia is wrong, because they are &#x27;independent news&#x27;, we can only admire the ability to maintain double standards without as much at batting an eye.<p>(<a href=""http://www.osce.org/fom/116312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.osce.org/fom/116312</a>)<p>[1] I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with Russian government definition of &#x27;extremist/radical&#x27;, but their point is that above Russian sites have given their pages to neo-Nazis to call to armed struggle against the state.",1394791478

So node was basically set up to serve static pages, in the hope that later they can migrate the API to node as well.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s all great, but unfortunately since I know the WalMart statement is a load of BS I distrust the rest of the metrics provided.",1394791350

That is primarily for two reasons.<p>1) Early adopters generally tend to do well, whatever the language may be.<p>2) And more importantly, the asynchrony in nodejs is not easy. Writing maintainable JS is harder than writing Python or Java. So if someone has been through that grind, chances are they could be good developers.<p>Being able to do everything with a single language is kind of a big deal for many companies; the only thing holding back JS of the messy nature of callbacks (and promises, yuck). I would expect real adoption of JS to begin when ES6 features (generators, classes, etc) become available.",1394791295

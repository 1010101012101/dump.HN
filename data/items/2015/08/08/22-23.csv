10028872,comment,10024681,10028498,0,0,BenoitEssiambre,,,"I like to make simplified agrarian economy metaphors:<p>Say you had an isolated farming village where people wanted to save to be able to eat in the winter. It is important that farmers invest their profits into additional production to have something to eat in the winter, even if, because of perdition, the stored crops are only worth 90% of the initial investment required to produce them.<p>Otherwise, if they instead mandate their government to create a currency that keeps 98% if its real value when other forms of savings available don&#x27;t, most farmers are going to work, trade part of the crop they don&#x27;t want to eat to diversify their diet and keep their cash profits to be able to buy something to eat in the winter. They will not produce a crop to store for the winter since it would only return -10% and their central banks promised to keep money at -2% real value.<p>However, now comes winter and all farmers have cash but few have anything to sell because they didn&#x27;t reinvest their cash in the production of a stored crop for the winter!<p>It&#x27;s going to be difficult for the government to control inflation in such conditions because there will be too few goods for the amount of money people will want to spend. If the government manages to control inflation it will be by depressing the nominal value of the crops of the few farmers who did invest and save a crop for the winter. The central bank might do this by giving high enough interests payment on cash to prevent people from wanting to spend it immediately. In any case, people won&#x27;t eat much during the winter.<p>This could all have been prevented if the central bank had kept money devaluating sufficiently and farmers would not have kept their savings as cash but would have reinvested them into an extra crop for the winter and have continued to trade during the winter.<p>What you call allowing &quot;malinvestment&quot;, I call allowing sufficient production or production capacity to fill the needs of the future even if the returns are quite negative on this production.<p>Note that there are parallels with farmers saving for the winter and a baby boom saving in preparation for retiring and stopping to work.",1439074082

While methods of the form &quot;getFoo&quot; have plenty of history in Java, it&#x27;s also fairly common to drop the &quot;get&quot;, especially when the class is being used as an immutable value type.<p>For example, both Google&#x27;s AutoValue library and the Immutables library show examples of getters that drop the &quot;get&quot; prefix:<p><a href=""https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value</a><p><a href=""http://immutables.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://immutables.github.io/</a><p>One argument against the prefix is that immutable value types don&#x27;t have setters, so it&#x27;s not as important to distinguish between them. Another argument is that immutable values aren&#x27;t really objects in the object-oriented sense, so accessing a field really is just a data access as oppose to an action being performed by the class instance.<p>(I guess one aspect of Java that makes this less awkward to implement is that methods and fields have independent namespaces, so nothing stops the Route class from having both a &quot;name&quot; field and a &quot;name()&quot; method. That&#x27;s possible because Java doesn&#x27;t have first-class functions, so you can always determine from usage whether something is a field or a method.)",1439074067

The article quotes the guy as hearing the problem and saying:<p>--“My instant solution was, ok we have these big devices nowadays… why can’t we use them to capture these invoices, use technology to convert that image into text and extract information out of these invoices,” he adds. “It was pretty much a bottoms up approach.”--<p>Yeah... no. I&#x27;m afraid it is much, much more challenging than he realizes. Here&#x27;s a quick, non-exhaustive summary:<p>1. Most paper invoices are printed and then either mailed or faxed. Sometimes the vendor&#x27;s accounting staff manually annotate (e.g. hand-writing) the printed paper with additional information that didn&#x27;t exist on their accounting system (e.g. purchase order number). By the time the invoice arrives at the AP department, the quality of writing on it can be atrocious, which greatly affects the accuracy of OCR. So you need to use complex image processing on the invoice first, and then OCR it. You may also need ICR to read hand-written information.<p>2. A lot of vendors change their invoice formats on a regular basis (e.g. by changing to a different template on QuickBooks). This means that whatever machine-learning you use to process a vendor&#x27;s invoices will be invalidated when the format changes.<p>3. Smaller vendors, such as mom-and-pop shops that restaurants sometimes deal with, are very undisciplined about their invoicing, and can forget to put key pieces of information on the invoice, or make typos.<p>Over the years, I&#x27;ve come to realize that the only way to efficiently deal with invoices is to make sure they never become paper-based. We have been pushing our customers and their vendors to use EDI instead, which is a LOT easier to control and standardize.",1439073412

However, one thing I don&#x27;t like with putting matrix dimensions in templates is that then you can&#x27;t construct them at runtime. I do understand the obvious - that you can&#x27;t have both static type checks on all operations and runtime-determined matrix sizes. Though I would kill for a language which would specialise my code at runtime and throw an exception for compilation errors. So you could write, e.g.<p><pre><code>    template <int m, int n, int l>\n    Matrix<m, l>\n    mul(Matrix<m, n> lhs, Matrix <n, l> rhs)\n    {...impl...}\n</code></pre>\nAnd then be able to call it like<p><pre><code>    int m, n, k, l = ... read from file or whatever\n    Matrix <m, n> m1 = ...;\n    Matrix <k, l> m2 = ...;\n    try {\n        Matrix <int o, int p> m3 = m1 * m2;\n        // ^ code compiled dynamically\n        // or loaded from cache, based on\n        // runtime types of m1 and m2.\n        // o and p set to the result\n        // of type inference.\n        // I could imagine even having\n        // specialised versions with inline\n        // assembly for specific dimensions.\n    } catch (DynamicCompilationException e) {\n        print(&quot;dimensions not compatible&quot;);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nJava could be it, if it had reified generics. You&#x27;d create an implementation of Num, or load one from cache, then instantiate the template and attempt to call the mul function.<p>Or you could abuse the invoke dynamic feature - create specialised functions matrixMultiply$m$n$l and classes Matrix$m$n from some other templating language as needed, then do an invoke dynamic based on type.

Now my questions are:<p>1- We are focusing on one market and it looks like our message is working, we are spending ~$1 per day to get the word out, is that a good thing?<p>2- What&#x27;s the best way to quickly educate the user about how to use the app?<p>3- Is it possible to ask for a seed fund at this stage?",1439071823

Nothing about the VM is especially better for this than the JVM for instance.<p>> I see nothing wrong with ETS, it&#x27;s well optimized for the Erlang term format in particular and gives you serializable updates.<p>There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with it (as a complete neophyte to ETS and the EVM generally), the question is how much <i>better</i> it could be if it was on one of the several first rate JVMs that get so much more resources poured into them.  Sharing data concurrently is precisely what the JVM is good at (especially at very large data set size). So in the cases where you need to use something like ETS, there is a lot of potential for improvement on a JVM vs EVM.<p>> But it&#x27;s already there in a cohesive whole. There is absolutely no reason to switch to the JVM when the EVM is a beast of its own.<p>I don&#x27;t want to speak for `pron` but I suspect what he is getting at is, the combination of the Erlang full story on the JVM would be a phenomenal bit of tech and it would be much easier (and more likely) for the Erlang bits to get ported to the JVM than it would be to bring the EVM up to the standard of any of the best JVMs.",1439071660

Manipulating it so that it stores value for an individual at a real rate of -2% when private market stores of value&#x27;s risk adjusted real returns are lower than that is a market distortion that transforms people&#x27;s savings into a huge loss to the economy.<p>I am the one being meticulous about the implications of real vs nominal.  In particular I am saying that people&#x27;s saving should be tied to something real by making sure they end up in something backed by real economic activity like stocks, bonds, actual stuff or credible promises of production of actual stuff.<p>You on the other hand don&#x27;t seem to see the different implications between fiat stores of value and real value tied to production and production capacity. You have no problem if people&#x27;s savings end up as purely nominal idle fiat without any real intrinsic value tied to them, if people&#x27;s savings accumulate as pure government created claims on production from other people who have not promised to fulfill those claims.",1439071560
10028775,comment,10028162,10028162,0,0,benten10,,,"There&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been wondering lately. The concept of modern &#x27;social&#x27; internet, to me, seems to presume that the majority of the users share at least some core liberal values of acceptance of a diverse set of ideas, and respect for other individuals, as they are, and assumes that the society is at least reasonably peaceful and stable.<p>What happens when the internet comprises mostly of individuals whose don&#x27;t share those views? What when/if, for example, a vast majority of internet users believes that women shouldn&#x27;t have sexual choices, that gays are abhorrent? As someone from South Asia, I like to imagine the internet of the Future when most of the internet users are those men who seem to have a pathological hate/fear of women and values seen as &#x27;liberal&#x27;/&#x27;western&#x27;. Men are already aggressively violent against women when they are openly identified. I wonder how the dynamics change when they could get anonymous.<p>Even further, what if a large population of internet users deeply detests any other populations, and wants them dead.<p>I was watching the trailer for this new documentary on the genocide in Cambodia(?), and how people live in peace with their children&#x27;s murderers as neighbors. With a constant barrage of reminders of terrible events from the internet, and the mutual massaging of strong emotions [REMEMBER what they did to our parents/kids! NEVER FORGET!, etc], I wonder if on the whole, the internet will make things a lot worse in a lot of places/the internet as a whole will significantly change form.<p>You could argue that the same could be said for any communication media. I remember reading about the role that Rwandan FM stations played in the Genocide: they would keep aflame the fires that were burning out, and constantly supply fodder for death and hate. Apparently it was only after the stations were closed that things began to get slightly under control (?). With the possibility of blimp-powered and satellite internet, the kind of communication that cannot be disrupted at all, I wonder how things would be.<p>I like to imagine a scene of outright violence and civil war -- say race riots and race-based violence in the US. Would the easy availability of the internet help or hinder peacekeeping efforts?<p>What would be the right response in such situations?",1439071559

It might make sense for a company focused on serving banking to own a bank or two as a means of testing systems and perhaps marketing its products to new customers based on glowing testimonials from said banks.<p>While such an arrangement of banks as affiliated companies would require substantial upfront capital, it is feasible that such banks could be operated revenue neutral with regard to burn rate for the core startup while providing a somewhat liquid asset should the core startup go bust (which is technobabble for &quot;a bank could be run to break even and sold when the underlying startup folds with the proceeds returned to the investors who funded its creation/purchase&quot;).<p>That said, a lot of high return capital is going into more predatory financial institutions such as payday and title loans because of the higher interest rates and lower regulatory burden and the fact that the rich people banks are designed to serve tend to have many good options while the customers who tend to use payday and title loans have few options and usually none of them are good.<p>Good luck.",1439071499

The user pays or otherwise rewards the developer because he gets utility from the software. The developer makes software that has utility for users because there's no reward (monetary or otherwise) in making software that isn't useful a user (which could well be the developer himself).",1340852298

There is a massive brain drain of engineers & tech entrepreneurs moving to the US to start their own business (E3 Visas).  These are American, not Australian companies.<p>* The current tax law is a nightmare for those AU startups wishing to dole out equity.<p>* Lack of talent, the majority of students have steered clear of tech disciplines in university after the dot-com bust, the effect of this is being felt now as engineering talent is needed.<p>* The government is not focused on the needs of startups preferring to invest heavily in pie in the sky ideas or just digging the dirt out of the ground.  There is no decisive strategy from the opposition nor the current gov in power.<p>* Lack of funding.  There are just not enough investors in Australia looking to fund in Australian tech startups.<p>The Australian startup scene is booming!

When I came back to the house the last time he was in hospital I noted how carefully he had organized everything which had been such a mess when I had last left (created mostly by me as I tried to go through my mother's papers to put some stuff in order).

I think people end up being very polarised here.<p>The biggest benefit I get is that I can work on a set of changes as a set rather than a linear sequence that only ever goes forwards in time. I use microcommits. As I make progress on a feature, I discover necessary refactoring that I would ideally have been done before I started to add the feature. Interactive rebase allows me to make this so, and the result is that when I am done I can review my own work and check it for correctness with much more confidence than otherwise.<p>When working in open source, you're expected to provide a patch series for easy review. Git lets me produce such a thing with the same workflow.<p>Developers who don't wish to work this way, or are unaware of the benefits that this can bring, use git linearly and will see no benefit over Subversion.",1340851869
4170184,comment,4169356,4170112,8,0,commieneko,,,"Artist's color mixing models aren't simple mechanical ratios. They use emergent properties of chemicals that just happen to be a particularly useful color.  In fact, artist try to do as <i>little color mixing as possible.</i>  Mixed pigments of the types artists use do work like the inks used in printing and the dyes used in RGB displays.  Color wheels are guides and approximations.  Learning a color theory that is more accurate is counter productive because you can't find pigments that behave that way. And if you ever get a chance to see a painting in the flesh and compare it to even a very good reproduction, you will see that the simple color model primaries used in printing and on screen reproduction are only loose approximations of the real colors.<p>Now what an artist <i>does</i> need to know is how color works perceptually.  And the models used for this are pretty good.  And remember the intended result is seldom ""photo realism""; not that photos are particularly realistic.  But that's another discussion altogether.<p>If you are talking about amateur artists, or beginners, then, sure, lecture away, but if you talk to someone who's been successfully painting for 40 years, my advice is to listen to him/her.  They may or may not know much about the physiology of human vision, but don't be surprised if they do, but they certainly know the ins and outs of making you <i>think</i> you see what they want you to see.<p>The nice thing about standards are there are so many of them. I've spent more time than I cared to writing software to convert and compare between systems.  They are a few <i>lingua franca</i> systems, but if you are doing serious, critical color work, your special cases are going to be the bulk of your job.  Which only makes sense if you think about it. The sources I used are going to be about 30 years out of date, and the chemistries and optical systems no longer relevant.<p>Doing mechanical color reproduction is a specialty and few people need to know more than the basic RGB/CMY model and whatever specific systems that they need for their domain of activity.  These days these models are very good and well tuned for their domains.  Unless it's a brand new technology (Or NTSC; don't get me started!)  This usually means working with a specific palette and color gamut.<p>And while a lot of people in the various industries feel that they are dealing with the <i>real</i> color models, and the rest mere approximations, there is no such thing. In the end it all breaks down and you are left with making specific measurements with specific types of equipment for use with specific use cases.  And then you calibrate.<p>Color theory is very much a case of the map not being the territory.",1340851853

Many databases have other ways of introducing unstructured data that aren't going to murder performance. PostgreSQL's hstore, for example.<p>> the user might check out a model to work on in isolation of the parent system, the data might be stored as SQLite databases instead of some proprietary bit bucket, and then uploaded back to the server in total where the model data is yanked out for server side processing<p>I have a friend who has used SQLite as an interchange format. It worked reasonably well, but he also didn't have to worry much about schema versions. Still, you can do that without making your backend pay the penalty.<p>> The above scenario, where isolating the user's datapool so that they can take it offline, do work, then check it back in to the system is almost absurdly simple.<p>It's still more work than using a file system for no advantage. Just having it in the database doesn't necessarily constitute a winmost DBAs would suggest you weigh the filesystem alternative against dumping files into BLOBs in the database before deciding which way to go.<p>There will always be exceptions to any hard and fast rule, but I don't think the ones you've described above warrant this design.",1340851487

4170147,comment,4169934,4169934,5,0,einhverfr,,,"I dunno about the letter.  I use the GPL v2 for most of my work and Stallman is a major reason I am opposed to moving to the GPL v3 (that and the license is long enough to be difficult to understand, while the GPL v2's difficulties come from simplicity).<p>Part of the thing though is that I am not convinced the GPL has the reach that Stallman likes to pretend it does.  At least in the US (and presumably even fruits-of-labor countries) copyright is not supposed to be a way to monopolize secondary markets for practical tools.  See the concurrance in Lexmark v. Static Control and also the opinion of the court in Sony v. Connectix.  Note that no court in the US has ever allowed secondary markets for practical tools to be controlled through copyright of a work in the primary market, and I am not aware of any country which has held otherwise.<p>In general, copyright is supposed to protect artistic contributions, and protect and author from having his/her work distributed without compensation.  How that work is used in a practical way (i.e. other than as a work of art) is beyond the scope of copyright law at least in the US, and presumably in other places as well.  Indeed, steps required to use a piece of software, even where it involves literal copying and even distribution of literal copies, have been held to be fair use under 17 USC 102(b).  See Sony v. Connectix, Lexmark v. Static Control, and Oracle v. Google.<p>So I think that copyright only gets you so far.  The sort of control that Stallman wants to see the GPL have can only be possible through software patents and we know how he feels about that topic.  The GPL cannot reach cases where interoperability is sought and where the original work is not distributed.  Anything else is wishful thinking.<p>So I don't see the GPL as any great menace, but a lot of that is because I don't think it reaches as far as Stallman likes to think (or at least pretend) that it does.<p>IANAL, TINLA, and if you are looking for legal advice here you are a fool for trying to get it on HN ;-)",1340850781

So how come the Android OEMs can't ?<p>Because Android doesn't have the same ridiculous cult around it that Apple does. The iPhone made enough money to make carriers beg Apple to let them carry their phone -- more often it's the other way around, which is why bloatware and disabled features and all that other stuff infects every non-Apple phone. The demand for iPhone is astronomical, and that is the only reason Apple is in a position to instruct the carrier. If normal OEMs try this, the carrier will simply destock their items, remove the subsidy, and the OEM will never get any meaningful sales.",1340850035

Explaining how vision works to visual artists, especially amateurs, is one of the more rewarding things I ever do: you can see these lightbulbs going off in their heads as a bunch of stuff that they know intuitively and experientially is given proper names and ordered into a comprehensible model.<p>> <i>As for CMYK and RGB color spaces, these are simple but quite effective tools for dealing with color in a purely mechanical way.</i><p>I think these spaces have no place being taught to non-specialists. They are not intuitive to humans, being based on particular technology rather than on human vision. Any user interface which exposes these color spaces to non-experts is letting them down. Just as bad is using HSL or HSV or some similar trivial derivative space. Image editing software, in particular, is dramatically harder to use than it would be if the dimensions were at all relevant to vision.<p>> <i>If you really need a color model more closely tied to how human visual physiology works, LAB was designed as a good approximation of that. Specialists sometimes use other, often proprietary systems.</i><p>Specialists looking for models related to vision mostly use open, publicly developed and specified models. At root, most of modern colorimetry is based on the CIE system, which has served very well since the 1930s. Recent fairly effective models that would be useful for software include CIECAM02 and IPT, which behave better in some ways than CIELAB, but are a bit more computationally expensive.<p>> <i>If you need this level of knowledge, you got some book larnin' to do. No blog posts or comments on HN is going to help you too much.</i><p>Thats reasonable.

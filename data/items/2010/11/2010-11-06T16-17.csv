Not necessarily. On an internal website we found that IE8 took 8 seconds (!) to run a jQuery/jQueryUI command to style all of the buttons on a page. Granted there where more than a couple of buttons, but the point is that DOM manipulation  can be a time sink if you don't manage it right. (By contrast the same command took ~1s in Chrome and Firefox, which still isn't insignificant).",1289062611

If there was an advantage to hitting a lower price point in the subsidized device market, they would already have an iPhone4 LE or something out.<p>In the unsubsidized market they <i>do</i> have such a thing out -- it's called the iPod Touch. Which factors heavily into iOS propaganda.<p>Though they learned with the iPhone 3GS -- when they kept the 3G around for the people who apparently couldn't pull together $150 -- that ever burger flippers ponied up for the big boy.<p>Consumers, especially in North America (but to a degree worldwide) are addicted to subsidized phones. From my wireless company I can pick up an iPhone 4 for $159, or a Samsung Galaxy S -- the hottest selling Android device -- for $179, the contracts for both cost the same.<p>The iPad, as others have pointed out, is one of the cheapest decent tablets you can buy. For the media player market Apple has the entire market covered, hitting as discount of a market as exists.<p>Of course you're playing to the ""iPhone is a luxury brand"" misnomer that is utterly ridiculous. The hottest selling Android devices all have a post-subsidization price virtually equivalent to the iPhone product, and most of them require the user to then go out and pick up their own high capacity SD card.<p>That asymco piece, by the way, is horrendous on so many levels.

1877246,comment,1876956,1876956,0,0,ted_livingston,,,"Hi All,<p>Ted from Kik. Just wanted to jump in and answer a few questions:<p>On October 21, 2010 we launched a completely new service. The only thing that was the same between new Kik and old Kik was the name and the app store accounts. Users from the old system (about 55K active in the last week before the hard switch over) were notified that the new service was available and that the old one would soon be shut down. About 23K did get the upgrade, but almost all of them dropped it immediately due to losing all of their contacts from the old system, and the now lack of built in SMS texting. You can see this in the graphs - a brief peak, followed by a multi day flat line. I really apologize if this is misleading, it was not intentional.<p>The numbers. They are real. We can hardly believe it ourselves. The app is built to be incredibly viral (more on that later), but we <i>never</i> spam any of your contacts. All that happens is on registration, we do a quick one time, secure scan to let you know who on Kik you might know. That's it. Nothing is ever stored or shared, and nobody outside Kik will ever hear even a peep that you have joined Kik (unless, of course, you tell them, which a lot of people seem to be doing!) From there, people keep using it because they really like it. It is a bit hard to understand or explain (well, not as hard as Twitter I guess, but still) so it is probably best to just use the app for a bit. You will see why people like it.<p>We are moving as fast as possible to scale the servers, and add features. As noted below, we've been working on our vision for almost two years now, and this is just the first step. Expect some pretty cool things to come, and until then, thank you for letting us share in this incredible ride.<p>Ted",1289062412

Is getting somewhere quickly as valuable as a vehicle?<p>The intuition of a person who doesn't value rational thinking is going to be worthless in an empirical field.  The gut feeling of someone who can't show they are right is not likely to be correct.<p>Intuition is just the fast-read cache of pre-computed notions.  If a problem looks similar but not exactly like a dozen or so others that you have solved in the past, you take a sort of snapshot of all that past work and distill it into an intuitive grasp of the problem.<p>If you see a problem unlike any you have ever encountered, you are unlikely to have an intuitive idea of the solution.  Sometimes people will pull past-solved problems out of their fast-read cache and apply them to unrelated problems in an irrational way; sometimes people will feel their intuition guiding them in a certain way and <i>rationally</i> realize they are projecting subconsciously an unrelated situation onto the problem.<p>So intuition is only as valuable as its rational basis.  Intuition is much more efficient, much like using a rainbow table to crack a password; the table is only as effective as its precomputed hashes; it will never crack a password that hasn't been precomputed.  However, compared to a traditional brute-force approach, it's orders of magnitudes more efficient.  A brute-force approach however, with enough time will crack <i>any</i> password.",1289061063

Well, obviously the iPhone is the toy. You have to do incredibly awkward things, or pay Apple $100, to run your own code on it; you can't tether it (sometimes); you can't replace the Web browser. It's hard to script it. Want to use your favourite email client? Good luck.<p>But hang on. Clearly Android is the toy. You can pick up Android phones for a lot less than an iPhone.

Unless, IQ increase dramatically.<p>Than there's the emerging invisible economy in which everything is determined by supply & demand, but also contracts that are per se, not ""enforceable"", and where reputation matters. That where people can find jobs in spite of the structural deficiency in the wider economy that forbid the price floor for labor to drop to where it needs to be. They are happening <i>now</i>.<p>But there's the past record in which new jobs are created out of jobs being eliminated by robots. There are demands for humans to program them, probably repair them, and so on.

It seem to take forever right now, though. This could be simply be our linear point of views, but not the actual development rate.<p>But then again, whether or not we have jobs in the future is not determined by what arguments I make, but of the facts.",1289059206

If I had to identify the why, i'd have to agree with the jazz reference.  I seriously started comparing the various distros around 2003, and OpenBSD just gave a more consistent, well documented and clean experience.  It is a very conservative distro, and has a pristine configuration and network stack.  It's reliable, and trustworthy.

I'm referencing one of the most standard, frequently cited set of benchmarks for programming languages but make no claim that they're perfect.<p>You can read all about them here: <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/</a><p>There's a very obvious reason why a language may be relatively fast today and relatively slow tomorrow - namely, <i>other</i> languages continue to be developed as well.<p>And now, here's what the point of my comment is. I assume you work with PHP and are unhappy hearing that it's slow. Well, I work primarily with Ruby, which in general is even slower, so don't take offense. :)<p>Let's take a look at the context of this conversation. You haven't seen any evidence of its relative speed for ""several years,"" and haven't even given the issue enough thought to discover the most obvious reason why its status may have changed, and yet in the face of somebody offering evidence (I did on the OP) are reluctant to accept the possibility that PHP is slow. I've programmed in PHP for around 10 years, starting when 3.0 was in beta up until the first few releases of 5.x, and in that time I've seen many, many PHP developers with this attitude.<p>This is a general problem of the PHP community: Zend has done a fantastic job marketing PHP, and PHP has been used on so many high profile projects, that developers just assume PHP is ""blazing fast,"" when that's simply not the case.<p>Now, before I get attacked as a PHP hater again, let me point out that even though I prefer to work with other languages now I am by no means a PHP hater. I just recommended a PHP solution over a Ruby one to a potential client, because in their business context I thought it made more sense and couldn't in good faith sell them a technical solution that wouldn't meet their needs as well just because it used my current favorite language.<p>I'll also explain where PHP <i>is</i> quite fast. A lot of the functionality in PHP is just a very, very thin wrapper on top C library calls, and has very little overhead.  This is why things like math operations are generally quite fast.\nFacebook's Hip-hop compiler, which precompiles PHP to C++ and then compiles it to native binary, produces code which on some benchmarks performs <i>worse</i> then the original PHP code because of this fact.<p>But the parts of PHP which aren't just delegated to C code are in general <i>very</i> slow. Consider, for example, a benchmark that's heavy on array traversal. Take a look at PHP compared to other languages and see how incredibly badly it performs compared to <i>everything</i> else:<p><a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=binarytrees&lang=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=bin...</a><p>TL;DR: 16 <i>minutes</i> for PHP and 268.15 <i>seconds</i> for Ruby 1.9.<p>If you want to bitch about the fact that that benchmark includes the time it takes PHP to compile the code, well, then subtract roughly 0.1 seconds from PHP's time, but also do it for Ruby since Ruby's benchmark also includes compile time. Opcode caching isn't going to save you here.<p>Think about this for a second: what do you use more in a web development context: math operations, or array traversal? Just think how much time your web apps spend looping over database result sets. See what I mean? PHP may certainly be ""good enough"" but please just stop saying it's the fastest thing out there unless you can show me some proof.<p>If the PHP community had more of a backbone and stopped believing untruths like ""our docs are the best in the business"" and ""PHP is the fastest scripting language"" then Zend would be forced to do something about it. The fact that the language, the interpreter, and all the soft infrastructure around it are such a mess is not because Rasmus or Zeev or Andy are incompetent, it's because for years they've had such an incredibly unskeptical community of ""true believers"" that never holds their feet to the fire on <i>anything</i>. Stop being a true believer. Insist on something better. Bitch and complain if you have to. That's how to improve the programming language you love to use.",1303303452

2466318,comment,2464764,2464764,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"A friend of mine (raised Jewish, but deist/agnostic) came to the conclusion that the most reasonable cosmology is one in which each person reincarnates as <i>every</i> human ever to live before passing on to the next world or becoming a god. This probably rules out free will, but it gives hope that, maybe, we <i>do</i> get to experience at least the entire human world... we just don't have the luxury of perceiving it all at once. It also solves the karma/ethics problem neatly.<p>This is a tough realization, in any case. Even a million-year lifespan wouldn't help, because all of the books we were reading now would be likely to fade if we were to live another million years. As humans, we're innately finite in all sorts of important ways (e.g. attention, memory) that have nothing to do with lifespan.<p>I have to agree with the people who've said that ""it's the journey, not the destination"". It's all we can control, and it's what we actually experience. As a deist and Buddhist, I've often wondered why God wanted us to evolve in a world where lives are so short and death happens all the time, instead of one in which humans could get a more reasonable 10,000 years (or process information and experience 100 times faster, which would have the same effect). It's infinitely frustrating and reminiscent of Sisyphus (probably, in fact, a Greek metaphor for the reincarnation of the spiritually lazy, noting that ancient Greeks did believe in reincarnation) but it also has a certain beauty to it: getting to go through childhood and to re-learn all of the great things in this world again, and again, and again.",1303302960

They'd be much more likely to spearphish people at change.org and then host some malicious code on the website. The ""Jasmine Revolution"" calls for protest was something that the entire party was very pissed about, but those calls emerged from a relatively small blogging service based in north carolina that would have been easy to take down - yet nothing happened.<p>Second, DDoS source country != DDoS controller. This should be obvious to everyone. Obviously when anon DDoS'd paypal et al. most of that traffic was coming from the US, but no one thinks the US was behind it. China has some of the highest rates of infected computers on the net, obviously many of those will be in bot nets that can be rented for any purpose. When you hire zombies it's quite possible to specify what countries you want them to be in.<p>Clearly it's become quite common to blame China for hacking very quickly. A lot of the time that's only based on something like the IP address of the CnC host being based in Beijing. The difference here is that's usually a safe bet because of the PLA's massive ongoing program of malware based espionage.<p>Here they really don't have the same history. I'm sure a program like change.org has a lot of people who don't like them, and who better in this environment to try to blame your bad actions on than China?

For example, for a long time (still might be true), Chrome would go nuts if someone tried to play an audio link that produced a 404 error.<p>So, this isn't a comprehensive answer, but hopefully shines some light on where HTML5 actually is with regard to providing an experience similar to a native app.",1303300894

Certain types of groups like nations, startups, and schools of scientific thought, may be be inherently unstable on various time scales, yet that doesn't mean they don't arise, have dominating effects relevant to reproduction during their heyday, and that evolution doesn't need to adapt to the reality of their existence. That is to say, groups are not a unit of selection in the sense of natural selection. They are the context of selection.<p>Powerful social groups are a fact of life. Powerful enough to decide your fate, choose who you could or could not marry. We see them all around us. We see such organizations form, thrive, and die on a wide variety of scales, both in time and level of influence. If you can't network, you will wither in this and probably every other major society which ever existed. No want wants to partner with, or stay partnered with useless dead weight.<p>An example of a group of non-necessarily related individuals who share a common goal is an army. Soldiers may be more closely genetically related to many of their foes than they are to many of their comrades. Soldiers may be ordered to their deaths. Armies don't last forever, they don't have to. They exist to defeat other groups of people and impose some collective sanction. If a hypothetical free rider gene resulted in the formation of less effective armies, any population where such a gene predominated would be severely disadvantaged in war, and eventually massacred and/or enslaved.",1303300800

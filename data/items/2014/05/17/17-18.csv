This would further add to the recession.&quot;</i><p>These companies exist to make money for their shareholders, not to act as an economic stimulus for the rest of society. Car companies frequently lay off workers and idle their production lines in response to economic slowdowns. Then, when the economy picks up, they hire the same workers back. (The workers don&#x27;t really have anywhere else to go that will pay them comparable wages.) And if there&#x27;s no revenue coming in from car sales, how are they going to pay those employees to make more cars? How are they going to buy the materials to build new cars?<p>A private company could never work this way, only a government (like the &quot;Five Year Plans&quot; in the Soviet Union, in which state-owned companies were manufacturing piles of goods that people didn&#x27;t need).<p><i>&quot;Currently May 16th, 2014, all of these cars at the Nissan Sunderland test track have disappeared? Now I don&#x27;t believe they have all suddenly been sold. I would guess they may have been taken away and recycled to make room for the next vast production run.&quot;</i><p>No, they probably haven&#x27;t been sold yet, but they&#x27;ve been shipped off to dealers in other countries to be sold. It&#x27;s not economical to build or export cars a few at a time, so they&#x27;re going to be moved in large batches. &quot;I don&#x27;t believe&quot; is hardly a convincing argument for anything.",1400348596

7760642,comment,7757666,7758158,2,0,kushnick,,,"The Urban legend speaks – I wrote 3 books on this topic, which outline, in detail how New Networks generated the numbers.<p>In the 1990s, all of the phone companies in the US applied for and received alternative regulations which was based on their commitment to replace the  copper utility wire, known as the PSTN, Public Switched Telephone Networks, with a fiber optic wire. This was based on then Al Gore’s call for America to be completely upgraded by 2010, called the information superhighway.<p>And the state laws were changed to give the companies billions of dollars per state and this was done by multiple financial incentives—where the phone companies’ services were no longer examined for profits, even though there was no competition at the time – so ‘call waiting’ cost less than a penny, and the companies charged $4.00 – and this included almost all services, such as non-published numbers.  Their profift jumped from 12-14% to 35-40%; they had major increases in dividends, they took massive tax write-offs for the networks, among other things.<p>And the companies lied about their deployments but continued to keep the excess profits. – So, all rate increases were tied to these financial perks, where the state never went back and changed the laws or got refunds when the companies failed to deploy.<p>While states, like New Jersey, where they collected about $15 billion, were supposed to be upgraded by 2010 with a fiber optic service capable of 45 Mbps in both directions. \n<a href=""http://newnetworks.com/verizonnjbroadbandresources/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newnetworks.com/verizonnjbroadbandresources/</a><p>And it continues today with more rate increases. Our new report shows that regular POTS, plain old telephone service,  customers were charged about $4 billion in New York State for ‘massive deployment of fiber optics’, even though the majority will never get any upgraded service.<p><a href=""http://newnetworks.com/verizonfiostitle2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newnetworks.com/verizonfiostitle2/</a><p>I wrote 3 books on this. The first is about 1980-1998, with Foreword by Dr. Bob Metcalfe, second was in 2005 and the third  book is coming out next month. \nBook 2: <a href=""http://www.newnetworks.com/broadbandscandals.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newnetworks.com/broadbandscandals.htm</a><p>And we filed in multiples states over this since 1999, we have separate reports about the revenues and profits that’s been published.<p>If you got specific questions after you read the books, -contact me.

There were plenty of people in my school who were smart(including me) that weren&#x27;t considered nerds or bullied. In fact, the kids who were bullied for being &quot;nerds&quot; at my school weren&#x27;t even smart. More likely, they either had awful social skills and dressed and acted weird. Or, they had some weird hobby like playing card games during lunch in highschool. And lets not forget, if you&#x27;re a school with a bunch of smart kids, you can make friends with them, so nerds aren&#x27;t smart people, they are really just socially handicapped people.",1400346159

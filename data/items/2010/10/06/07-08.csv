I'd rather have something like, say, France, where they've rewritten the constitution enough times to be on their Fifth Republic but at least they've had <i>a</i> republic of some form for over a hundred years (not counting foreign occupations and puppet states).<p>Also, judging by the explicit and implicit amendments and interpretations, the US is arguably on its third Constitution--the first being the Articles of Confederation, the second being the antebellum Constitution, and the third being the present Constitution.",1286351884

1763123,comment,1762782,1762782,0,0,jackowayed,,,"This is a simple case of competition eliminating economic profits.<p>Right now, investors generally make extremely good returns. The reason the LP's go with them instead of a mutual fund or some other safer bet is that the returns are better so much better, even factoring in the risk. But consistent returns that are better than the other options (better meaning enough higher that it's a better option despite the increased risk) incentivize other people to get in the game so they can get a share of those profits. But with more investors out there, there's more competition for deals, which increases valuations. In a perfect world, it'll find equilibrium at the point where the expected value of investing in a VC fund is the same as the expected value of investing in a mutual fund--the returns will be a little higher in good times, but the risk of a bad fund will be higher. This is how the free market is supposed to work.<p>Unfortunately, the market tends to overcompensate for things. So instead of finding equilibrium at just the right amount of investment money, what's happening is that we're going from too little money to what is probably too much money. This means that valuations will get so out of control that investors will start getting returns that are low enough that other investment options have higher expected values. This is also a bubble, as it means that startups will be overvalued.<p>The only bright side is that it looks like the bubble will mainly manifest itself by VCs making no money and entrepreneurs making lots of money, rather than tons of failed startups like last time. So far, this bubble is characterized by good companies being funded at very high valuations, rather than hopeless companies being funded at very high valuations. (Of course people were probably sure pets.com would make tons of money in 1998.)",1286351587

1763115,comment,1762682,1762682,0,0,thought_alarm,,,"I'm reminded of the story of NUMMI [1], the American automobile plant that was a 1980s joint venture between GM and Toyota.  (It was covered in an episode of This American Life).<p>In a nutshell, the story of NUMMI involves American GM workers building Toyota-designed/GM-branded vehicles using Toyota's radically different manufacturing processes.  The plant itself was a smashing success for GM; the plant achieved much higher quality and productivity than any of GMs traditional plants, and it gave GM valuable insight into their rival's manufacturing and design processes.<p>But this insight into Toyota's processes failed to transform GM because the GM corporate culture was so entrenched.  It took the company the better part of 20 years to really adopt these changes they learned in 1984, as they continued to bleed market share to the Japanese.<p>The point of that story is that I believe the corporate culture of any large tech company is equally entrenched, and in my experience it's this corporate culture that utterly determines how a company's products are designed and produced.<p>So it really doesn't matter <i>how</i> Apple does things, it only matters that they're different and successful; their competitors will be completely unable to react or change.  Every company is full of powerful employees who have worked their entire careers to get where they are, and they will fight tooth and nail to prevent losing their position over anything else.  Do you think all those PMs at Microsoft are going anywhere?<p>So companies like Microsoft, Motorola, HP, Acer, Nokia, Sony, and Nintendo can only do what they've always done.  And if you look at their products, that's exactly what they continue to do in the face of a radically changing landscape.  That's why a Toyota or an Apple or a Google is so truly threatening to their entrenched competitors.  They achieve dramatically better results by doing things differently.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUMMI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUMMI</a>",1286351314

1763112,comment,1755748,1761624,0,0,loewenskind,,,"First off, I would just point out that a tremendous amount of literature has been written about Anarchistic theory.  Probably a lot more than we have time left in our lives to completely read.  You can't just handwave the system away with ""yea, but there are bad people!"".  This has obviously been covered at length.  What the theory lacks is real world large scale testing which will obviously be extremely difficult to do.<p>>You can't handwave that away.<p>Which is why I didn't.  I gave the reasons I believe people were susceptible to it and gave reasons that those problems may no longer apply.<p>>And you expect people under anarchy to voluntarily mobilize for the sake of strangers around the world?<p>I'm not <i>expecting</i> anything.  I'm considering the possibility that <i>if</i> we switched to a government-less world (which would mean <i>drastic</i> changes, no government implies a great deal of other changes) that if someone tried to rise up and take it away from us people might mobilize to stop it.<p>Your Syrian/Lebanon examples don't strictly apply because those are other countries.  Invade the US and see how passive people are.  In a government-less world there is no more ""country"".  Potentially people would form other kinds of groups and not care about people outside of their group, but if they are ignorant enough to do that then they wont be intelligent enough to have an Anarchist system at all, Genghis Khan or no.<p>>Also, it's not entirely clear that our current level of technology and communication would continue to function without government<p>Open source and various open source systems seem to work well enough.  It's not <i>clear</i> or proven but to do that someone would have to actually try it and see.<p>>they likely require a free market system<p>No, this is one of those drastic changes I was talking about.  You can't have any kind of bartering system what so ever or it just devolves right back into the current system. Ancap is a nonsense theory like US-Libertarianism is for largely the same reasons.<p>I do believe though, that the system isn't viable even with our current technology because I think that the constraint of having no barter system means there can be no work that has to be done that no one wants to do.  This means we would have to have robots doing all that kind of work.<p>>None of this can be provided without a government.<p>Not true.  If you're really interested, have a look at some Anarchist writing and see what they actually have to say about these issues.  It's not some kind of cursed literature that will damn you for reading, it's just an idea that may even be wrong.<p>>Governments are even more entrenched, and it's not clear that it's even possible for major parts of the world to function without them.<p>Big parts of the world <i>do</i> function without them today.  You don't have to buy into the system, I'm not convinced myself (and I have no confidence that it will be tried on a large enough scale on my lifetime anyway) but the effort put into it deserves more than the simple brush off that you give it.<p>>Empirically, I'd rather go with what's been proven to work and improve on it.<p>I wouldn't frame the system we have today as ""proven to work"" but rather ""managed not to utterly fail outright"".  If you're a programmer you should be able to appreciate this difference.<p>The issue with this mindset is that at some point the government system becomes a drag on progress.  The government is always a drag to some extent but they usually provide a net gain due to the services they provide (e.g. justice system).  When and if we reach the point that we could provide most or all of these services in a more efficient form than they do (e.g. email today vs. US Postal service or telegram service) all that remains is the drag.  I think we're already seeing signs of this (e.g. government attempts to prop up the obsolete media distribution model).",1286351295

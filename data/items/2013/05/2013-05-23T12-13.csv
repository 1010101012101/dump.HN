If your game runs at 60 fps in firefox and 15 fps in other browsers, it's effectively firefox-only game.<p>Additionaly browser games can't have main game loop (cause it would hang the browser infinitely), but often use ""requestAnimationFrame"" to trigger updates with the best sustained refresh rate available. Even if only one frame out of every 10 in your game is taking 20 ms instead of 16 ms - your game won't run with 60 fps anymore, but with 45 fps or 30 fps because browser is trying to choose refresh rate that will work.

I couldn't be happier. I'd also like to note that I share zero photos with the public, all my photos are 100% private or shared with family members/close friends.<p>Having said that there is plenty of improvement to go:<p>- iOS app (maybe it is also the case for the Android app) needs to improve (auto upload, better integration with iOS, etc). Recently I went on holiday and only used my iPhone to take pictures (over 5GB), it would be nice for an easier way to tag + create/add to set + upload photos and videos. By the way, where is the tablet app?<p>- Video is really really bad. Apparently Flickr doesn't support long video playback (and by long I mean 10 seconds or more - i think). Now a days (specially with smartphones) video is a big part of albums/experiences. Video needs to be permitted and nicely integrated within photo albums.<p>- Upload via web is nice, but a better Mac/Windows/Linux native app would go a long way for power users. Better upload resume, tagging, etc.<p>- Map view. Something is wrong with the new Flickr, it has a world map view, but it doesn't read/process any geo location from my pictures - unlike iPhoto which does this flawlessly. I need to drop one by one the photos into the map for these to be processed. I also have to say that the Nokia map could be better, I'd love to see Flickr using Google Maps. Has someone experienced this same thing?<p>- Better album sharing, a la Dropbox, would be great (e.g. allow friends and family to download an album as *.zip)<p>These are just a few things I would like to see in the coming updates.",1369312519

In the past few years we've seen a lot more interest in entrepreneurship and startups, VC's, and incubators.<p>We run a casual, low-pressure mixer kind of event about once a month. If you come to Japan, you can follow our blog (<a href=""http://www.makeleaps.jp/blog/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.makeleaps.jp/blog/en/</a>) or signup on Doorkeeper to get notified of events. We get lots of visitors from abroad swinging through and we're always looking to help support other startups in Japan or small businesses trying to enter the market here. It's a really good crowd of people.<p>There's also a meetup for HN readers in the kansai area of Japan if you're visiting there.",1369310716

5756329,comment,5756134,5756275,8,0,danso,,,"I'm as quick to dismiss re-skinning as any self-righteous dev, but this really hit the spot for Flickr. Flickr has always had a trove of useful photo archiving and categorizing features...sometimes I upload photos just because their geocoding editor is so convenient to use. Many of the other major photo services lack even simple group creation of photos (I.e. having a single photo endpoint both be in your ""Family memories"" and ""Summer Vcation"" albums)...and Flickr is by far the best in terms of making it easy to discover old, but significant photos.<p>This is not to say that this means Flickr will survive against Facebook, anymore than quality point and shoot pocket cameras have a chance of revival in our camera phone era. But Flickr, for now, definitely has the edge in quality and variety of photos. Even if you think Instagram filters are the best thing ever, the laws of physics (I.e. optics) limits the vast majority of their photos to a narrow range limit.<p>It's worth pointing out that Google Plus has had a better photo album design than Flickr for awhile now...I just tried them out (again) and saw that they, for the most part, have most of what makes Flickr useful. However, Gplus is decidedly focused on social sharing...it's hard to describe how this drastically impacts its use as a photo service...but using GPlus's photo feature was, for the first time in a long while, that I've just given up in frustration in the first five minutes. But this may be just a sign that I've finally hit old age.",1369310668

3483943,comment,3483662,3483662,36,0,geoffschmidt,,,"How (I think) it works:<p>Basically it's a bunch of animations that play simultaneously. For example, there is no actual timer. Instead there is an animation of a bar filling up, and an animation of a ""game over"" screen doing nothing for a few seconds, and then sliding onto the screen. All of this is done with CSS keyframes.<p>Each of the alligators is actually a radio button styled to LOOK like an alligator, including an animation to move up and down in a fixed pattern. When you check the radio button, it changes the style (through CSS rules conditioned on the checked state), which changes the animation to take the alligator off the screen.<p>Now, the scoreboard: For each alligator radio button, there is a corresponding radio button in the scoreboard, paired up so that checking the alligator button unchecks the scoreboard button. The scoreboard buttons are stacked on top of each other, and unchecking them causes them to animate their height down to zero. This effectively computes the number of checked alligator-buttons and outputs it as the height of the element. At the bottom of the stack is a strip of images for scores 0, 1, 2, etc, so that as the buttons are unchecked, the right one moves up into the display area.<p>Finally, the ""play again"" link at the end just reloads the page.",1326970086

You can't call anything that's illegal ""stealing"". It's piracy, which is illegal, but a different act than stealing.<p>People who started calling piracy stealing are the same people that cannot accurately understand what is actually happening, and people who benefit from calling it stealing instead of correctly portraiting it as it's own crime.<p>The desensitized image of piracy that people have is somewhat close to the way some people have a desensitized image of credit card fraud. The image that you're hurting a faceless corporation, and not an actual person. Introducing the moral part in an action that doesn't accurately portray a victim is the hard part. When stealing it's easy because you can relate and imagine the victim of an action.",1326968560

I buy 50 'read units' which really means 50 rows / sec or 100 rows / sec if eventual consistency reads, as long as the row is < 1KB in size.  So it costs ~$7 a month for sustained ~50-100KB/sec read speeds.<p>I can think of several recent applications that required 100ish rows to build each view (lots of tabular data).

Of course, the market for $20K digital backs is... pretty small.<p>Kodak's strategy in the digital age was try to become a technology broker, and let others tackle transforming this tech into actual end product - but it doesn't take a genius to figure out that your licensees and customers will eventually vertically integrate and push you out entirely. Canon built their own sensors, Sony got into the sensors game and pushed Kodak completely out of the consumer sensor realm, and between those two Kodak's doom was all but sealed.<p>Instead, their consumer-level efforts focused on stupid, low-margin, technologically simple wares like inkjet printers and digital photo frames, all lowest-common-denominator product categories where Kodak didn't have a significant technological edge against its competitors.<p>Kodak <i>invented</i> the digital camera, but they completely dropped the ball.

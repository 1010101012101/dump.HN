I&#x27;m sure you know about the raging debate that has been happening between MapReduce and Parallel DBs, and a big part of the reason that MapReduce (Hadoop) style has had so much support is because it&#x27;s easy and cheap. In lots of instances it may run slower, but why pay for the hassle when you can just run Hadoop for free (not including server costs)? You&#x27;re making the same point here. Whats the threshold on money savings? How much does it cost to use a DaaS (SQL or NoSQL) compared to what you want to do with Gun/Redis? (Also, is this going to be open source?)<p>Next, the conflict resolution should be interesting. What kind of eventual consistency guarantees are you hoping to have? I see you&#x27;re planning on addressing this.<p>I&#x27;m also interested in the querying. That is, are you using Javascript? My problem with what you&#x27;re saying about current query languages is that it&#x27;s not really <i>that</i> hard to get the bare usage out of them. Simple queries in SQL are extremely straightforward. In addition, declarative languages really make things easier for the programmer, not harder. Who wants to have to deal with all the nuances of a join? Certainly not me.",1397501940

7588067,comment,7585605,7587532,2,0,psaintla,,,"In my experience, both.  It starts with business users creating rules without having a clue what they are doing and it ends with the system becoming so complex that it would have been better off being written by engineers using tools more appropriate for the job.<p>Typically what happens is that business discovers they can now implement every last feature they desire without getting any push back from engineering so they go wild implementing new features without realizing the consequences.  There is no VCS, no QA, no testing.  There is no one telling them they cannot do something because it won&#x27;t scale, it isn&#x27;t secure or it won&#x27;t be maintainable.<p>Their only metric for success is that they get the result they want now and the long term consequences be damned.  Worse yet, every single person using the rules engine is acting independently and not as a team.  There is no code review, when the rule works to their satisfaction it gets pushed into production.<p>At first everything works fine and people get promoted for saving money on engineering costs but then the rules start getting more complex, start becoming composed of other rules, need to have more complex actions or need to integrate with third party systems.  Eventually the simple rules engine turns into a bastardized programming language that everyone adds onto and never modifies because no one understands how a modification will affect the 4000 other rules in the engine.  At that point you end up having to do a complete re-write, which is something I have had the displeasure of doing in the past.",1397501888

7588064,comment,7586812,7587944,7,0,mightybyte,,,"Or you could just make a sequence of several stages itself be a stage, collapsing the preponderance of abstractions like this post talks about.  Then, instead of having a mutable property holding a directory, you might just use a function that takes a directory and returns a stage.  You could have another function that takes a file and returns a stage.  Guess what...this is starting to sound an awful lot like a monad.<p>Departing a little from the OP&#x27;s topic, I think it&#x27;s interesting that your outlined design relies significantly on mutable state (&quot;a property of type directory&quot;).  I think one of the biggest advantages of Haskell is its purity, which discourages you from thinking about things in terms of mutable state.  This has far ranging positive effects.  It makes APIs much easier to understand and use.  That in turn results in Haskell programs having MUCH more code reuse than other languages.",1397501788

That drops data into an object, and wakes up the main thread, and blocks.<p>The next time the main thread wants to give processing time to the actor, it describes the world into the same shared object, waked up the actor&#x27;s thread, and blocks.<p>Doing a switch like this dozens or even hundreds of times per second seems to work pretty well, especially if the main thread only gives execution to the actor thread when it needs to - inputs have changed, etc.<p>For my use cases, it radically simplifies my code, and I have a small number of different inputs to handle, so it has been scaling well.",1397501778

At the very least:<p>- Make `#main` narrower; perhaps 700px or even less (long lines are hard to read)<p>- In `body`, apply a line-height of maybe 20pt (the lines seem too close together for the font size)<p>- Also in `body`, drop the text-shadow.

Timestamps do fail pretty miserably for handling conflict resolution - while my algorithm does use timestamps, the timestamp is hardly responsible for the actual synchronization. It just provides a basis to initially sort things off of, and then the conflict resolution kicks in.

I still believed in the idea and i thought a part-time job would help cushion the cost of living. Again I failed to find a job. I started a business buying vehicles for other people online with a view to earn a commission and support my family. The biggest problem began a few months when I lost money for a friend&#x27;s car and foolish enough (I just realize it now) I kept quite with a view that I will replace it. I tried borrowing but nothing helped.  I tried to explain to my friend about what happened but he couldn&#x27;t buy my story (I don&#x27;t blame him if only I told him there and then). As I write this post, this friend reported me to Police and tomorrow I have to either take myself to Police and get arrested for failure to deliver his vehicle as agreed. I feel bad to see my once united and happy family (my wife, two children and 3 dependants separate) all because of my foolish decisions. As once a respected person in our community I have now been turned into a laughing stock.

7587944,comment,7586812,7586812,5,0,twic,,,"The idea that this composability is unique to Haskell is false. Java&#x27;s streams are an example of exactly the same thing in another, non-functional, language. The Gang of Four &quot;decorator&quot;, &quot;composite&quot;, and &quot;chain of responsibility&quot; patterns are further general examples.<p>It is true, perhaps, that in Haskell, programmers reach for homogeneously-typed composition more readily than programmers in other languages. Good for them! But it&#x27;s either arrogance or ignorance to assert that this is a special Haskell thing.<p>Furthermore, i am dubious that this really is a good strategy for building large programs. The idea that you can combine lots of parts of some type to build a bigger part of the same type is extremely appealing. But in my experience, the bigger part often has slightly different properties, behaviours, or uses which warrant a different type with more features. Unless you want to impose those features on the smaller types too.<p>For example, consider a batch application which processes files through a number of stages (i realise it&#x27;s the 21st century, but apparently we still need to do this). There is clearly a type for a stage, with values for things like uncompressing, validating, renaming, parsing, etc. There is probably going to be a type for a chain of stages, with values for various uses of the application. A chain looks like it should have the same type as a stage - ultimately, both take a file in, and spit a file out.<p>But then, it turns out that we want to move the file through a sequence of directories, one for each stage, as we process it (the operations guys are really keen on this). Furthermore, we need to be able to report on what files are currently at which stage. So, a stage knows which directory it owns - presumably, it has a property of type <i>directory</i> for that. But a chain owns all the directories of its component steps, so it owns several directories - it&#x27;s going to need a property of type <i>collection of directory</i>. So what do you do? Report a single directory for the chain, and somehow expose the rest through a backdoor? No, that&#x27;s a kludge. Have every step report a collection of directories, which will mostly be single-element collections? No, that&#x27;s weak, because the type of a step no longer fully describes its the constraints on it. Use a higher-kinded type parameter, so the chain can have a collection of directories, while the steps have a single one? Mad wicked, but racks up the reader&#x27;s cognitive load. Use different types for steps and chains? Well, actually, since that&#x27;s simple and doesn&#x27;t have any practical drawbacks, probably yes.",1397500520

But I&#x27;m on Windows and I doubt the Sketch team have the resources (or interest) in producing a Windows version.<p>For those of us on Windows looking for an alternative to Adobe Illustrator, here are two possibilities. Neither of these match Illustrator feature-for-feature, but they&#x27;re perfectly capable for designing interfaces or web graphics.<p>Inkscape: free, open source and cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux). It holds up well against Illustrator and can produce professional-looking results. If you&#x27;re familiar with other vector drawing apps, the interface won&#x27;t feel too intimidating. If you&#x27;re a complete newbie, it might take a little while to learn the interface. Downsides: It doesn&#x27;t do multi page layouts (not an issue for everyone). It doesn&#x27;t feel like a native windows app and can be slow at times with large or complex drawings. Some of the dialogs are cluttered and not always clearly laid out. There are tutorials on the web (and books) but nowhere near the volume you&#x27;ll find for Illustrator.<p><a href=""http://www.inkscape.org/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inkscape.org/en/</a><p>Xara Photo and Graphics designer: Windows only ($90/£70). This is fast (faster than Illustrator) and well featured. The interface in my opinion is better than Illustrator in many respects. For example, to add a drop shadow, simply drag out a shadow from a shape. In Illustrator, it&#x27;s done non-interactively via a modal pop-up dialog box. You can create multi page layouts (much easier than Illustrator&#x27;s clumsy artboard management). Downsides: like inkscape, it has an enthusiastic community of users but nowhere near the number of learning resources as Illustrator. It produces anti-aliased images but for web graphics this can sometimes be problematic because the anti-aliasing is applied to straight lines too (so you sometimes get slightly blurry straight edges rather than crisp ones). Illustrator has solved this with its &quot;align to pixel grid&quot; option.<p>There is a free trial of the program available<p><a href=""http://www.xara.com/uk/photo-graphic-designer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xara.com/uk/photo-graphic-designer/</a>",1397499972

Please bear with my laymen&#x27;s mathematics because this isn&#x27;t my forte:<p>Let&#x27;s us XKCD as an example.  Your passphrase is correcthorsebatterystaple but since you hate typing out things you abbreviate it to chbs.<p>In most English passwords, you are limited to the characters visible to you on your keyboard; 52 letters (caps and lowercase), 10 numbers, 32 symbols. That means each piece of your password has 94 possible options.  That means there are over 78 million possible combinations to be tried to correctly guess chbs. When you realize that computers can hash through several billion attempts PER SECOND, your password starts to look like a terrible idea.<p>By typing out correcthorsebatterystaple, you go from 94^4 to 94^25.  This is what XKCD points out and it&#x27;s obvious that this is a big gain.<p>But it gets better than this...<p>Let&#x27;s assume that crackers start to use rainbow tables full of common words used to build phrases like this.  Instead of treating passwords by the number of characters, they start hammering on the number of words that are possible.<p>Instead of increasing the exponent of the perceived slot, you&#x27;ve gone from 94 possible options to however many words there are in the English language.  So instead of 94^4, you&#x27;re dealing with numbers like 250000^4.<p>This is why security people think passphrasing is better than passwords and why sites like Microsoft that limit you to only 20 character passwords are assholes.  It&#x27;s not the perfect solution, but it will help.<p>TL;DR: Passphrasing increases the security in your credentials in more ways than you are probably thinking.  Do it.  DO IT NOW.",1397499883

I thought it would be a cool idea to explore.<p>I quickly finished the programming of the algorithm and basic game play. Since each tile is a polygon, the numbers start from 3 (triangle) and 6 (Hexagon). So the number series is more like Threes&#x27;, but game play is more like 2048.<p>However, I had a hard time to convey the message of how the value of Pi was calculated, which I think really cool (check it out: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Polygon_approximation_era"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Polygon_approximation_era</a>). I tried different ways but they all look too cluttered on the small iPhone screen. Eventually I settled with the current solution: animate the polygon with most edges and value of Pi together to hint the connection between them, and show a tip of how Pi is calculated when the game is played the first time.<p>I am still not satisfied with this approach. If you have better idea, please let me know. I’ll try to make it better in following updates. But on the other hand, I found a few of my friends do like play this game a lot – they told me they like the sound effect (I made the sound effect a little musical – the higher score you have, the higher pitch it plays) and the subtle animation when two tiles merges.

The organization of the setup sction of the README is superb. The author of the README clearly thought about the needs of new users as well as seasoned veterans.  More projects need to adopt this general format:<p><pre><code>  # Getting Started\n\n  ## Quick Start\n\n  If you are unsure of our project and just want to play around, you can\n  get things set up quickly by:\n\n  1.  Clone this repository and…\n  2.  Do something\n  3.  Do the other thing\n\n  If you need more detailed instructions, have no fear. We are not going\n  to look down on you if you are not an expert. We took the time to write\n  a setup guide for newcomers: [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].\n  Everybody has to start somewhere.\n\n  ## Real Start\n\n  Follow these instructions if you wish to deploy your own version or\n  contribute back to the project. There is nothing we hate more than\n  README’s that ignore all of the practical concerns related to setting up\n  a long term installation. Follow these steps and it will be easy for you\n  to keep up with updates to the project and still retain the all tweaks\n  you made to suit your idiosyncrasies.\n\n  ## Odds and Ends\n\n  ### Optional features\n\n  Not everybody needs a XYZ plugin or wants to share their every action\n  with PQR. You can enable these features by…\n\n  ### Rare Corner cases\n\n  In certain rare circumstances you made need to prevent X or implement Y.\n\n  Prevent X by…\n\n  If you need to implement Y…</code></pre>",1397499446

A more in-depth discussion on the quality issues identified can be found in  Appendix B....<p>The  team  also  found  a  potential  weakness  in  the  Volume  Header  integrity  checks.  Currently, \nintegrity  is  provided  using a string (“TRUE”) and two  (2)  CRC32s.

It&#x27;s a combination of things, and one of the most important things is getting good practices in place.

I&#x27;ve worked with multiple enterprise-oriented software companies whose founders hustled to make early sales at any cost, and then ended up creating massive long-term costs that far outweighed the value of the initial sales. &quot;Poison chalice&quot; customers are common in the enterprise space -- they look great up front, manage to ameliorate your burn rate, and then you end up mortgaging the future of your company to support a small number of contracts. It&#x27;s incredibly hard to turn down those contracts, though, especially as they often come in as relationship sales, and because the companies in question rarely staff up sales at the beginning.<p>I consider this a good example of why founders need to onboard professional sales as soon as reasonably possible; it&#x27;s a whole lot easier to turn down those poor-fit sales when you&#x27;ve got an active funnel, and it&#x27;s very hard to build that funnel when your entire company is trying to keep those poor-fit contracts happy.",1397498507

So then we have two apparent Norwegians (me and uer haakon) who cares. So maybe &quot;somebody cares&quot;, after all? :)<p>> Well, thats a strawman as i read it. You can&#x27;t compare &quot;normal&quot; names and names with special letters in them. It does not really make sense.<p>Right, <i>normal</i> with scare quotes. What is that supposed to mean? So then, &quot;Ch&quot; is not &quot;special&quot; compared to &quot;å&quot; simply because of some technical limitation? Because &quot;å&quot; is somewhat distinct to the Scandinavian languages? Why is &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;Kristian&quot; normal, distinct names, while the use of &quot;aa&quot; does not produce distinct names? In fact, as you can see in this thread, some people name their child &quot;Håkon&quot;, others name them &quot;Haakon&quot;. &quot;aa&quot; is not simply something you throw in as a replacement for &quot;å&quot; in <i>names</i>.<p>This is a Danish example, but so be it: Many Danish places have gone over to using &quot;aa&quot; instead of &quot;å&quot;. So this was a deliberate decision, not simply &quot;we just spell it however we want&quot;. They had to make a decision. In constrast, Språkrådet[1] of Norway does apparently not want to do the same for places like &quot;Ålesund&quot;, for example. So at least as far as Språkrådet is concerned, the use of &quot;å&quot; or &quot;aa&quot; in <i>names</i> does matter and they consider them to be distinct &quot;characters&quot;. Not simply shallow pseudo-typographical conventions.<p>&quot;Ch&quot; is not really a (compound) character in the Norwegian language, as in Norwegian words (outside of, perhaps, loan words). And yet, we respect people&#x27;s names enough to call people who are &quot;Christian&quot; as &quot;Christian&quot;; not &quot;Kristian&quot;. Did people who named their child &quot;Christian&quot; miss the &quot;k&quot; letter on their keyboard? Most likely not. Yet they chose that spelling, and we respect that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nrk.no/norge/_-ikke-stedsnavn-med-aa-i-norge-1.7039175"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrk.no/norge/_-ikke-stedsnavn-med-aa-i-norge-1.70...</a><p>> As i said, this is quite common in Norway.

As an example, when the SNB dropped the swiss franc cap earlier this year (one of the biggest financial news stories for years), I know people who had time to read the headline on Bloomberg, look to see where the market was trading, and sell EURCHF within 0.1cents of where it was previously trading. As I watched the market reaction, I&#x27;m fairly confident that the other traders reacting were also human. As it was unscheduled, no-one would&#x27;ve been actively anticipating it happening on that day, never mind that minute.<p>Generally, there are two types of financial news events. First is scheduled, for example unemployment data - here, there are APIs to get the number and place trades, and as a human it is impossible to compete. Similarly, for FOMC statements, there is an API feed which provides objective answers to certain questions about the statement, e.g. &quot;Did any Fed members vote for a rate increase?&quot; Again, computers dominate. The other type of news events are surprises - unscheduled events that people are unprepared for. I&#x27;m certainly no NLP expert, but I do watch financial news feeds every day, and I can&#x27;t imagine it being remotely easy to write a program to filter out the false positives. I&#x27;ve certainly watched a lot of market reactions to headlines, and I can tell that a lot of headlines that people would assume would be easy to write algorithms to trade on, produce market reactions that look far more &quot;human&quot; than the instantaneous reactions to unemployment data or embargoed Fed statements.",1430046331

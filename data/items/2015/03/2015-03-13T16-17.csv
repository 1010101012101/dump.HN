Then the 1-star reviews started coming in. Each 1-star review had no actual content in the review. It was clear that the writers of these BS reviews hadn&#x27;t read the book at all, since they didn&#x27;t mention anything specific whatsoever. However, each of the 1-star reviews DID manage to mention a competing book that was &quot;better&quot;. And all the bad reviews mentioned the same exact competing book. It was ridiculously obvious that someone was bashing my book to push a competing book instead, without any actual substance. At first I cared, and asked Amazon to remove the reviews, which they did.

Titan, for example, is about half water ice, but it is so cold there that it is effectively a rock.<p>What we&#x27;ve been learning is that there is water ice in some places we didn&#x27;t necessarily expect it before (such as in the form of permafrost underlying much of the Martian surface) and most importantly that <i>liquid water</i> is not as uncommon as we once thought. Liquid water is what&#x27;s most interesting from the point of view of looking for environments that can support life forms. Previously we thought that the presence of liquid water required not only the presence of water as a material but also overall planetary temperatures in a temperate range, the so called &quot;habitable zone&quot;. Which, as it turns out, is a fairly narrow zone. But we&#x27;ve learned that there seem to be numerous circumstances that allow the existence of substantial quantities of liquid water in conditions that otherwise would not support it. Europa, for example, has frigid surface temperatures (150 to 200 degrees C below freezing) but it has a sub-surface ocean due to tidal interactions with its neighbors.

The most common involve work, money matters and relationships with partners, children or other family members. Stress may be caused either by major upheavals and life events such as divorce, unemployment, moving house and bereavement, or by a series of minor irritations such as feeling undervalued at work or dealing with difficult children. Sometimes there are no obvious causes.<p>> Stressful events that are outside the range of normal human experience, for example being abused or tortured, may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<p>> Some stress can be positive. Research shows that a moderate level of stress makes us perform better. It also makes us more alert and can help us perform better in situations such as job interviews or public speaking. Stressful situations can also be exhilarating and some people actually thrive on the excitement that comes with dangerous sports or other high-risk activities.<p>> But stress is only healthy if it is short-lived.

I have a lot of friends working on visas, both now and in the past. But I just don&#x27;t see the economics of this. How can adding hundreds of thousands of people in <i>any</i> field not depress wages, at least in the short-to-medium term.<p>Why do I care? I want young Americans to go into IT and engineering in general. They are becoming more interested because wages and job security have been improving (at least relative to other careers, I&#x27;m not sure about in absolute terms). If we open the valve and flood the market, wages will be affected. Maybe they won&#x27;t shrink, but maybe they&#x27;ll be stagnant. And maybe the job security isn&#x27;t quite as good.<p>When I was in school, many people didn&#x27;t go into IT because investment bubbles and trends in offshoring made IT work seem like a bad bet. There was skepticism that IT would provide a good long-term career. I don&#x27;t see how importing hundreds of thousands of technology workers won&#x27;t do the same thing.<p>So, again, I really want people all over the world to have opportunities, but I feel my concerns should be for the future of the young people around me. They don&#x27;t have another America to move to when their prospects get stale or bleak. They&#x27;re already here.",1426264226

Game Maker uses its own properietary scripting language called GML, and Unity lets you do scripting in Javascript, C++, and Boo, which is basically Python. Also, attempts are being made to integrate Clojure support in Unity as well[2]<p>On the other hand, if you like actually writing the code, there&#x27;s a good chance there&#x27;s a low-level framework (like SDL[3] for C++) which will let you code, but still take care of some of the hassle of cross-platform support and graphics. I&#x27;ve only played around* with SDL and C++ but there are quite a few tutorials for it.<p>Also worth mentioning is Construct2[4], a game engine for html5/js. It is possible to do 3d rendering in javascript/html5[5], but as far as I know, only Chrome supports it well. Last I checked you have to change the config settings in firefox to allow opengl rendering to work and I just assume IE doesn&#x27;t support it by default.<p>If you want to work with 3D and want to get something done then Unity might be a good idea, although of course you&#x27;re going to need good models, etc. Game Maker supports 3d but it&#x27;s primarily for 2d.<p>[0] <a href=""http://unity3d.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unity3d.com/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.yoyogames.com/studio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.yoyogames.com/studio</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJr_TD1BtF0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJr_TD1BtF0</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.scirra.com/construct2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.scirra.com/construct2</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.ambiera.com/copperlicht/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ambiera.com/copperlicht/</a><p>*I&#x27;ve got some of the basics for Space Invaders done, and it&#x27;s taken a while, after getting bogged down with creating a spritesheet manager and an entity component system, but I have a thing and it shoots bullets, and that&#x27;s nice.

As a registrar I can tell you that we would bend over backwards before allowing a domain to go this route.<p>Also there is very little practically that prevents a registrar from putting in valid whois info (event their own info) and holding the domain on ice until the registrant shows up (if they want to for some reason that is). There is nominal carry cost vs. the aggravation of doing the wrong thing.<p>And there are cases where no whois info at all appears and ICANN is ok with that. There is a domain that I am trying to get now for someone that is at godaddy. The registrant (fearing a UDRP) told godaddy to delete the domain. Godaddy didn&#x27;t do that they removed the name from whois so &quot;no match&quot; appears. Not kosher but they do that and ICANN doesn&#x27;t seem to mind. They will wait 30 days and then sell it to us for $24 backorder fee. To me that makes more sense time wise then taking it up with ICANN (and I have high level contacts at that organization that I can tap but for $24 why bother?)<p>Back to the issue of invalid info. Typically the process would start with someone filing the complaint form with ICANN. Then we get notified by ICANN and get time to fix the problem.  De facto, we can populate the whois with whatever we want and reply back to ICANN &quot;problem fixed&quot;. ICANN will then reply back to the person who filed the complaint &quot;problem fixed&quot; (to simplify things). Can&#x27;t vouch for what others may do, this is what we have seen happen.",1426264113

If anything, the median quality is significantly worse than American programmers. Green card workers tend to be much better than H1Bs, although &quot;better than average&quot; still doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>The problem is definitely the median, not the extremes. Top-quality foreign programmers are absolutely as good as top American programmers. It&#x27;s in the middle that things go sour. There are many reasons for this, both cultural and business. The big business problem is that H1Bs are hired from body shops to supply large numbers of staff quickly at a price target, so they rarely get to work on interesting, challenging projects. Whatever projects they&#x27;re on are dragged down by the poor quality of their teammates, so they don&#x27;t get to challenge themselves and excel. It&#x27;s also aggravated by their body shop employers rewriting their resumes in an absolutely generic fashion for maximum buzzword compliance, denying the workers a chance to shine and specialize to potential employers.<p>So the interview process consists of starting with a generic technology set, and then spending five minutes or so on technical questions to see if they actually know their ass from a hole in the ground or not (they usually don&#x27;t). If they do, the process can proceed normally. But without a resume that shows any individuality, it&#x27;s a huge waste of time for the interviewers to weed through all the crap. This adds to the perception of poor quality.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s a real problem.",1426263584

As you point out, there is a well known way to have refcounting act correctly in the face of multiple threads. There are other ways as well involving per-thread shadow counts and such, but that is the most basic way to (as I said) trade throughput for latency.<p>Re. your second paragraph, it is again not inherent to the algorithm, but it does greatly simplify things. In particular, pretty much all tracing algorithms require at least some kind of stop the world event, though some can make this event very limited in duration.<p>It is much much easier (and results in greater throughput) to stop the world if only one thread is running at a time, because you just do your collection when that one thread triggers a heap mutation.<p>If you have multiple threads running at once you need to coordinate when you stop the world, which means waiting for the threads to all wind up in a state where they can be stopped (which gets a lot harder if, say, one of the threads never allocates because it&#x27;s in a tight loop). If it takes too long to do this coordination, your heap might explode on you.<p>Again, what I&#x27;m saying is that a GIL is not an inherent feature of either garbage collection mechanism. This is really pretty obvious when you consider that there&#x27;s an abundance of implementations of all combinations of (RC, tracing)(GIL, no GIL). Python and Ruby&#x27;s main implementations both chose a GIL for simplicity&#x27;s sake (and an at the time safe assumption that single-core performance was more important than multi-core), but most C++ refcounting code uses interlocked counters and the JVM has obviously never used a GIL.",1426263130

I work for major tech company in the Bay Area. I have a salary in the six figures which is about twice what I would earn back home. I was excited to come to America and work for a company I admire in their Silicon Valley headquarters and the H1B lottery was the only way for me to do so.<p>Without H1B I wouldn&#x27;t have had this opportunity. I don&#x27;t feel like its indentured servitude, I have a salary which I believe is higher than the average market wage and is more than my American peers because the company is paying all of my visa expenses and the fees related to me pursuing a green card. I&#x27;ve been promoted once already in the 18 months since I arrived and received a related salary bump. If I wanted to leave and goto a different company, most in the bay area would allow me to transfer my visa so I could work for them.<p>H1B is not a problem for America or &quot;engineer&#x27;s wages&quot;. Abuse of the system is. Lets focus on curtailing that abuse and not on victimising H1B employees who may be very happy and grateful for the opportunity to pursue their own version of the American dream.<p>Spare a thought for those who had the job offer of their dreams, from that &quot;brand name company&quot; in an exciting field, and the opportunity to move to America, only for everything to fall through when they didn&#x27;t get selected in the lottery. That is surely not right.

9197894,comment,9195778,9197192,0,0,zeidrich,,,"Not all AAA games do try to jam themselves in to the cinematic space.<p>A lot do, but then you have to think about what it means to be a AAA game.  Basically, what is it that causes a game to require a huge budget?<p>A huge budget is generally due to a lot of assets.  A lot of assets is generally very high detail models and cinematics, the tools to tell a story.<p>The other thing is technology, things like creating an MMORPG is technologically expensive.  But look at your average MMO and note how they generally lack on the story side of things.<p>Gameplay on its own is pretty lean.  You can&#x27;t put a team of 100 designers together and get a great game in 1% of the time, but you can do something (with good direction) somewhat similar with artists.  You can have one guy doing the rocks, and one guy doing the hair, and a few guys doing architectural stuff, and some people doing monsters, and they can all fit together.<p>With gameplay though, it&#x27;s too much the essence of the game to be split across too many roles and still work well.<p>So you look at something like The Order: 1886, and you complain about how cut down it is because it&#x27;s so expensive to make.  But think about what that game is.  It&#x27;s a game to sell PS4s essentially.  Each new generation of console gives access to great new graphics and performance.  But when you have the ability to render the movement on the hairs on your characters arms, you have to hire someone to put hairs on peoples arms and make sure they act correctly in the wind.<p>You can certainly make games with lower detail, but then what is the point of the new generation of console? This is why I think the majority of games out there for the next gen consoles are either cross-releases with current gen consoles with some moderate performance or upscaling, or they are pretty but underwhelming.<p>The best stage to be creative is in the small teams of the 80s, and the more recent indie resurgence.   When you employ a battalion of creative people to make your game, you absolutely need to sell it.  You can&#x27;t take a risk.  And not only do you have to sell it, you have to sell big.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re a team of 4 people, sure you don&#x27;t want to go broke, but you can afford to make something that you think might be niche.  The especially cool part about that is that sometimes these teams discover something that we never knew we always wanted.  Take minecraft, little hobby project that can be done only because it&#x27;s a little hobby project, but ends up earning millions and being sold for billions.<p>And now it&#x27;s on the PS4 too.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t the game industry.  It&#x27;s the AAA game industry and the pressure to sell consoles with more power than people need to play a fun game.  The more detailed the games are, the more expensive they are to make.  The more expensive they are to make, the less risks they can take creatively.<p>This (and the internet) is the reason the Indie scene is pretty forefront right now.",1426262989

By that I mean, to create an application that has as good of voice recognition capability as, say, Google Now, is not that much harder than setting up any other event-driven input system. I&#x27;m sure the actual recognition of speech is quite difficult. But there are a fair number of APIs available that make it easy to <i>use</i> in your applications.<p>Almost every programming language has a canonical API that is extremely simple to set up. In .NET and Google Chrome, it&#x27;s even first-party, and I only mention those because they happen to be the ones I&#x27;ve used.<p>And text-to-speech is no different. You can get to &quot;good enough&quot; so easily that I&#x27;m somewhat perplexed why more people don&#x27;t do it.<p>I just think there is a perception that adding a speech recognition feature to your app is &quot;hard&quot;. It&#x27;s difficult to design a good speech-based user experience (I&#x27;ve found longer phrases work better than single-words, and it&#x27;s good to try to match on homophones as well), but actually integrating the code is not that tough.<p>So I would encourage you to ignore Amazon.

Frankly, this should not be on sysadmins shoulders, it should be the responsibility of developers.

But this is made easier with deploying containers, because they provide a better shrink wrap on the code delivered from dev.

People don&#x27;t eat sugar because it is part of their brushing regimen, they eat sugar because they like/are addicted to the stuff.<p>So if you&#x27;re eating sugar for reasons that have nothing to do with promoting teeth health, then brushing more often to combat that damage makes a lot of sense.<p>Could you eat less bad stuff and brush less? Potentially, but if people wished to drop sugar from their diet the list of benefits to doing so is so long that brushing less is just a minor footnote at best.",1426262580

But the usage pattern has turned out to be quite valuable, to have that layer of semantic processing in navigation, free from the rigid technical and structural constraints of DNS.<p>The regrettable part is when that semantic layer guesses wrong on some input, wrong being defined as something other than the user&#x27;s intent.  That&#x27;s an abstraction leak, which as always you can&#x27;t make up for unless you understand the underlying abstraction.<p>That the implementation of semantic navigation ended up piggybacked on search might be a bit weird.  Maybe it could have been done something like AOL Keywords.

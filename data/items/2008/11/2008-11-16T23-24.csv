What should I avoid to prevent that?<p>I am thinking of selling a somewhat unconventional and new (for the mainstream, like Lisp) programming tool. I thought that the .NET community will be less reluctant to try such a thing because MS is pushing new things like F# too. What do you think?",1226879692
366428,comment,366193,366193,0,0,rgrieselhuber,,,"This is certainly true, especially when you're only trying to create a feature of an existing product. There are however, recent examples of features from other products turned into successful services on their own (FriendFeed is one example that comes to mind).<p>The flip side is that there is very little new under the sun, even in technology, so successful products are more often than not the result of innovation as opposed to invention. I know Paul Graham has written about this, and it has certainly worked for companies like Google.<p>One important feature of new tech products is the whole product concept from Crossing the Chasm. In our field, where things are changing on almost a daily basis, it's hard to determine what the whole product may be but companies with this mindset and approach are much more likely to succeed than others.",1226879678

BUT, living in rural Minnesota as I do, it really isn't hard to lower your living cost below $1000 if you want to and are single (When I lived in the city of Minneapolis, my monthly bills including mortgage totalled probably around $1,500). Being American and living here in the US gives me a huge advantage on understanding our culture and being able to design a UI that appeals to Americans and to be able to support them that a smart Thai doesn't have.<p>I am seriously thinking of getting into iPhone development even though I've only seen one once :-) Why? Because I already design & build mobile Bluetooth hardware and I can see many apps where the mobility of an iPhone would result in a great product. I don't care about consumer apps, but there are tons of small business applications that have been waiting for this kind of connectivity in your pocket!",1226879421

366422,comment,366151,366270,0,0,briansmith,,,"More people losing their jobs means more people with free time to build an iPhone app while they look for a new new job. Plus, a poor economy lowers the market for these unnecessary goods. So it is likely the result of a serious recession is more competition for fewer customers.<p>Apple could reduce the number of iPhone developers by charging more for the SDK, or by charging a larger transaction fee. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple did increase the costs substantially sometime soon. In particular, I wouldn't be surprised to see the standard transaction fee increase substantially, with tiered percentages based on price and/or volume (e.g. start $1 flat transaction fee + 30% of the price for the first 1,000 copies, then reduce the percentage gradually for each 10^nth copy).",1226878998

366418,comment,366151,366296,0,0,briansmith,,,"If you build a good app for $20.00 then somebody might clone it for $2.00. But, will they survive on their clone? Probably not, if they are living in a rich country. You just need to outlast these cheap knock-offs until their developers get bored and move onto something else. It might be a constant stream of knock-offs, but the longer you last, the better the reputation you build. Reputation is worth a <i>lot</i>, especially with people whose lives don't revolve around software development.<p>A good developer in SW Asia, SE Asia, Africa, or Eastern Europe will always have an advantage over you regarding price. $10,000 or $20,000 a year goes a long way in those places (I lived in Thailand for $1K a month without even trying to be cheap). But, that is the case with other parts of the software market and somehow Asian, African, and Eastern European companies haven't taken over the while software development market yet. Probably in the long term they will, but that is years off.",1226878344

It's that we (and you, by the looks) are contradicting their ToS in quite an up-front way. We didn't know this at first (i.e., we didn't read the fine print carefully enough.) It's partly holding money in escrow, and partly collecting money on behalf of other ""traders"" (the developers).<p>As soon as they catch a whiff of that, they'll shut your account down, and lock your money in for 6 months.<p>It's not very pleasant, to put it mildly, and if I were you I'd switch to AlertPay or some other provider ASAP. Sorry to be negative about this ... but I'm commenting so you hopefully <i>don't</i> have to go through what we at microPledge did. :-)<p>(Edit: Oh, just curious, how much did you know about microPledge before you launched? I wouldn't be surprised either way, and certainly good on you for trying ... but your descriptions of the site on Bitloot sound awfully familiar. :-)",1226878272

They're there because mom and dad told them it would be safe/smart, and in other cases because they couldn't think of anything else to study.<p>So it's in those impractical majors (e.g. philosophy) that you're more likely to find free-thinkers, idealists. And as it were, that's exactly the type of attitude you need to reject offers for safety, security, and fortune in the name of your own romantic idea about making a difference (but probably just losing your shirt).<p>Least that was my experience, and I'm a startup founder + recovering business grad.",1226878027

366407,comment,366331,366360,0,0,bokonist,,,"In a SaaS company the cost of sales is recognized immediately, but revenue is only recognized one month at a time.  The company might spend $3K on marketing and sales to make $15K over the life time of the customer.  The cost of sales up front, while the revenue won't be recognized for months or years.  Thus when the company is in rapid growth phrase, earnings will be practically nothing,. All cash is reinvested in sales & marketing, and the profits won't arrive until growth starts to plateau.<p>Of course, sometimes it turns out that the sales and marketing expense is actually more than the life time value of the customer.  The company never gets to profitability, and the share price tanks.  This happened to Vonage.",1226877532

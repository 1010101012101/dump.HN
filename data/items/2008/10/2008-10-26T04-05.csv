Throw out a reduced version of XP that still adds 10% - 20% to the price tag (maybe more considering the hardware needs) & you take that market too.<p>I think we're really seeing a market crying out for competition.",1224997046
344061,comment,343571,343958,0,0,lacker,,,"I don't see why you are so dismissive of Unicode handling as it relates to programming language design. To deal with string encoding correctly, your programming language needs to transparently deal with different types of strings, or a single string that has two ways to iterate over it. That's an interesting design problem.<p>In particular, you do not want everything in Arc to be an object. But the typical way other programming languages deal with Unicode nicely is to have different classes that implement a common string interface. So how can Arc approach the string encoding problem without making everything an object? I don't know, but I do think it's an important question.",1224996988

344052,comment,343938,343938,0,0,snprbob86,,,"I went looking for a decent cross-browser calendar control a few months ago. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any that remotely fit my needs.<p>First, most of these are ""date pickers"" aka ""date drop downs"" instead of full blown calendars. Second, I need a lot of customization. For example, I want to be able to display a weekly calendar without dates. Or a monthly-style calendar which shows the current and next 3 weeks instead of named months. It needs to be skinnable to match my site as well as provide hooks for high level events like day-clicked. Ideally, I'd like both a server-side Python API for generating calendar HTML and a client Javascript API for manipulating an existing calendar. I know that's a tall order, but I couldn't find anything even close to that.<p>Rolling my own was difficult and time consuming. Luckily, I only needed prototype quality for now.",1224995565

Develop the code yourself, then have code acquired by your company, or prepare letter of intentions (that when you can do this legally, the code will be owned by the company for your stake increase).  And my understanding is that they don't care that much of you writing code for company either paid or free.  The government doesn't want everyone to create their own companies and get employed by themselves, getting legal status in US because of this.  Your case looks different though.",1224993997

Equal sexism results in worse experience by the members of minority. Equal experience would necessarily require lower sexism displayed by the members of the majority - read the Petrie multiplier post again if you don&#x27;t understand that statement. Thus push for equal experience in a male dominated environment is an equivalent of push for the males in that environment to display lower sexism than the women in the same environment. In other words it is an &quot;attack on men&quot;.<p>>I posit to you that there is no reason why it shouldn&#x27;t be zero.<p>And there is no reason why people shouldn&#x27;t violate red light.

They drill gas wells with a cocktail of chemicals that they keep secret so as to obstruct water testing. They contaminate residents wells and then have the cases gag ordered. They lobby our state government to lease state land and bypass taxes. They put contaminated water in containment ponds (not cleared for toxic waste) knowing they have active leaks and do nothing about it [1].

If you use a dumb storage like S3 as your backup server, you need to store your keys on the original box, and anyone who gains control of the original box can destroy your S3 bucket as well. Ditto for any SSH-based backup scheme that requires keys to be stored on the original box. A compromised box could also lie about checksums, silently corrupting your backups.<p>Backups should be <i>pulled</i> from the backup box, not <i>pushed</i> from the original box. Pushing backups is only acceptable for consumer devices, and even then, only because we don&#x27;t have a reliable way to pull data from them (due to frequently changing IP addresses, NAT, etc).<p>The backup box needs to be even more trustworthy than the original box, not the other way around.

I don&#x27;t see any reason why it won&#x27;t be supported (since rsync does), but &quot;nominally supported&quot; is different from &quot;optimized for that use case&quot;, and I suspect that many of the latest generation of backup tools are optimized for the opposite use case.",1416271281

Anyways, 80% of the jobs seem to be requiring knowledge of SQL and relational databases.<p>Now my skills are still somewhat basic but I&#x27;m accustomed to the learning process. I&#x27;ve gone through Learn Python The Hard Way, created my first little program and now crunching through Swift book - so there you go.<p>My only experience with SQL was using MySQL interface when setting up Wordpress installations.

Mind you I&#x27;m pretty serious about it so I don&#x27;t really mind spending some money (less than $100 though) but if there is good free material, even better!

On the top level you see mostly FreeBSD which as you say brings in the VFS, networking, most of the userland and lots of other things you see in a POSIX conforming kernel. However, many things are actually nothing more than just shims down into the Mach part of the kernel, which brings the virtual memory, processes, thread model and other “low level” stuff. Processes for example can be worked with as if they were a FreeBSD flavoured process, but that will just call down into a shim which calls down into Mach. You can however also work with processes the Mach style, eg. through ports and mach_msg.",1416269841

They come in varying degrees depending upon how much you smoke and the manner in which you smoke (its a bit tricky to figure it out at first).  The first &quot;level&quot; (if you will) is a sort of cartoonish kaleidoscope of cards or images, almost 2d.  The second level is when you loose the notion that you are on your couch; the experience becomes totally immersive and &quot;you&quot; can no longer be separated from &quot;it&quot;.  People describe it as a room, but this description is far, far, far from accurate.  The third level is when you <i></i>quite literally<i></i> come in contact with some kind of extraterrestrial or extra-dimensional entities (these are the only words I know to describe what they are).  They seem to be infinite in number because no experience is ever the same, with each contact being immensely different.  One common theme however is telepathy; communication most certainly takes place, but it is not with words.  Its like immediate meaning and understanding without the limitation of time.  It has happened to me during every single encounter and has led me to have a much greater understanding of post linguistic possibility.<p>Another thing I would like to add is that DMT is the only psychedelic that I know of (maybe mushrooms can hit this place at certain very high dosages) where open-eye reality can be completely transformed, when looking around you are no longer laying on your couch but in some kind of pod and the pipe you are holding suddenly contains a beautiful jewel and is embroidered with some kind of alien language and where, with each subtle movement of your eyes the pod you find yourself in transforms into different shapes with different panels, each wired to your optic nerve.  Holy <i>fucking shit</i> people:  what is going on out there?  More than meets the eye.  Its remarkable and weird and beautiful and scary and the greatest of mysteries.<p>Apologies for the total insufficiency of my words.  Everyone -- everyone -- should try it sometime, and particularly atheists and general skeptics.  Your faith in your own certainty will be dismantled immediately and forever.  The experience is anything and everything but a mere hallucination; its like turning the frequency on a dial and suddenly hitting some kind of super powerful organic SETI message that knows you are going to arrive.",1416269731

If you remove the fat, you remove the nutrients.<p>Instead of low-fat milk, we should drink low-sugar milk.  It is the milk sugar, lactose, that many people are intolerant to.  If you want to get a feeling for how much sugar is in milk, try lactose free milk some time.  It is made by introducing lactase which breaks the complex lactose down into simple galactose, and it tastes like a bowl of lucky charms.<p>Recently I have switched to drinking half-and-half instead, when I want some milk.  I may even try out heavy cream eventually.  Half and half has less sugar and more fat than whole milk.  Consuming fat is a great way to dampen the glycemic index of sugary foods, so I think heavy cream or half and half is a much better mate to cookies than regular milk would be.<p>whole milk: <a href=""http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/69/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/6...</a>

I have a bowl of cereal like 2-3 times a month (but really only because it is there for the kids). I don&#x27;t think I would miss it in liquid form if it was suddenly unavailable. However, it is in a lot of things I eat: cheese, yogurt, sour cream, chocolate, pan cakes, etc. So on one hand, it is a little strange that humans are the only animal to drink the milk of another animal and to drink milk of any kind past infancy. But on the other hand, products made out of milk seem as natural and appropriate as products made out of hamburger.",1416269039

8621621,comment,8620716,8621093,0,0,byuu,,,"In general, pretty great on FreeBSD. You have nVidia binary blob 32-bit and 64-bit drivers. The OpenGL performance equals Linux and Windows. The blobs aren&#x27;t available for the other BSDs. There&#x27;s some trouble at the moment due to the move to KMS and the new VT, with a new Xorg and new AMD/Intel drivers for it. Some consternation over when/if nVidia will release FreeBSD/KMS drivers. Supposedly the Intel driver is a bit behind, but nobody&#x27;s running Intel video for graphics performance. Nouveau isn&#x27;t available due to KMS breakage.<p>But to me, the focus should not be on trying to run the latest games. Linux isn&#x27;t replacing Windows for gaming, so there&#x27;s no chance FreeBSD is going to.<p>I&#x27;m running a 2560x1600 display on VESA, and after a few MTRR tweaks, it&#x27;s more than fast enough (I can push over 100 full frames per second), even for watching video and playing 2D games. The only thing missing is Vsync support in the protocol. And what I get in return is never seeing another graphics driver crashing my entire system (because we&#x27;re still stuck with monolithic kernels running video card drivers in ring 0 in 2014.)<p>I would say, get a nice desktop up using only a frame buffer with maximum bandwidth possible. Then if people want to run an EGL context, they can render 3D stuff to a buffer, and blit that into a window, or do a fullscreen EGL app that controls the display. But that should be entirely optional and only used where needed. The BSDs are server OSes, so I think this is acceptable to favor stability over performance.<p>The best part would be that this could run on (top of, if necessary) <i>any</i> system. Windows, OS X, DOS, Haiku, Minix, you name it. If you could write pixels to a screen, you could run the display server.",1416268831

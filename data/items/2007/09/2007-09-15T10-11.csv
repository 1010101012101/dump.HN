I don't believe that there is a single best solution. It's obvious that they both make products that meet a lot of people's needs.",1189852737

I never tried syncing the iPod, but it's not as if Windows comes with bundled iPod syncing either. <p>I guess you need a person in the know to set up Ubuntu properly for you, but that's it.<p>OS X scores a few points in the mentioned problem areas (at least it comes with a DVD player), but it isn't for everyone, either. Personally, I can't stand it.

Should we put them all in the gas chamber?  <p>Even if we let them live, Kardashev, brilliant though he may be, has hardly come up w/ a universal set of values that everyone is, should, or will eventually strive for.  <p>The best you can do is to absorb his ideals, spread his word and create technology that furthers his goals.  And in doing that you become an Ayn Rand follower.  ",1189851542

I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of shit, I am never reading again."" -- police officer Barbrady, South Park (1998)<p>
I made it about 1/3 of the way into The Fountainhead but got bored and lost interest. Self-interest is ok, but I'm not going to make it my religion.<p>The architect who wouldn't design what people like (because it wasn't rational, as I recall) seemed like a really annoying person to deal with. And I certainly wouldn't want to invest in his startup :)",1189850878

-Ayn Rand<p>Her books make the case that individuals working in their own self interest are the best thing for ""human civilization.""  Disagree if you will, but you'll have a tough time coming up with a definition of ""advancement of human civilization"" that everyone can agree on.  In the end you fight for your own vision of what the world should be and ignore the rest.  <p>Might is right.  Ignore that at your own peril.  Especially if you're in a startup.",1189850624

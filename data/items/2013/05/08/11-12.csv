Then either boot from it (if i'm on a crappy computer) or boot a vm direct from the usb if the computer is more competent. It's also quite nice if there's an emergency and you're away from your computer -- you can just rush into an internet cafe, plead/bribe them to let you boot from your usb then have everything, ssh keys inlcuded ready for urgent repairs!",1368014074

Last summer I had an iOS dev internship, but I wish to spend time creating iOS apps freelance to earn some extra money and to create interest applications I wouldn't otherwise.<p>Is it as easy for iOS devs to get short term work as it is for web devs to get work creating websites? Seems like everyone and their dog needs a website these days but only certain businesses want apps. Not sure which businesses to target.<p>Barring the apps I worked on at my internship (which included apps for the likes of Unilever), I only have one app (unfortunately a game) in the store at the moment. What amount would be a suitable prerequisite?<p>I noticed a post on HN[1] where an iOS dev charged 1k for an application.

5673578,comment,5672252,5673365,3,0,aethertap,,,"There are certainly clear differences between parties, otherwise people wouldn't be fighting each other over who gets elected. I like to think of it via a mental picture though - the American political system is like a line: on one end, you have the republicans, and on the other you have the democrats. Moderates and independents generally fall somewhere on the line between the two extremes. The issue is that the line they all lie upon is actually just a one-dimensional slice of a higher dimensional space (like a plane, to make it simple). My political beliefs lie on that plane, basically equidistant from both of the potential parties. It is therefore basically impossible to get meaningfully closer to what I would like to see by supporting either party, so in that sense ""there is no difference between them.""<p>I actually feel empowered by thinking that way though, because it eliminates distractions (politics) in favor of actual meaningful actions I can take in my own community (building things, helping people, etc.). If politics is removed as a tool, then problems no longer look political and you can do something about them that is ultimately much more effective than voting (in my opinion).",1368013201

So it essentially costs an individual 20-55% more than it could cost an employer.<p>(There's also the risk-pooling aspect; an employer can get a group rate with guaranteed issuance because it's assumed they will be selecting employees for moderate to good health (or else they'd be disabled vs. working), or at worst randomly, with only random-in-population odds of high-cost dependents.  There's an adverse selection with voluntary individual insurance; healthy people would rationally not get insurance if it were really expensive relative to their expected utilization, whereas someone with a chronic condition or high risk actually would get insurance even at a relatively high cost.  Which in turn drives up the costs per insured, which drives up the rate...eventually becoming uneconomic.  In practice, a lot of people with chronic conditions in their families actually do seek out stable jobs with big employers with good insurance to cover it, vs. doing startups or whatever, which imposes a loss on the economy if they would otherwise have been the next Elon Musk.)<p>The Republicans in 2008 (McCain?) were actually arguing for making medical insurance non-deductible for employers and I think deductible for individuals, which was then seized upon as ""taking away your health insurance"".

So even if you tell him the good news (What precautions you+town have taken to keep him safe), he will focus on the bad news (Murderer on the loose) so I don't actually think in the kids eyes that is any better than (a).",1211723520

199511,comment,199493,199493,0,0,raju,,,"Hi. First, sorry to hear about your problem. I too develop a mild pain in my lower left arm every now and then when working long hours, so I can empathize with you.<p>As far as getting better, I don't believe there is a magic trick. It all boils down to posture and taking appropriate breaks. There have been several discussions on HN about keyboards and desks [<a href=""http://searchyc.com/keyboard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchyc.com/keyboard</a>] but it takes a while to find a keyboard that suits you well. I personally have gone through several keyboards and have come to the conclusion that I will have to spend the money to get a really good one.<p>The other issue, as I mentioned earlier, is taking breaks. Getting up from your desk at regular intervals is good both for your arms, and back as well as your eyes. There are a variety of exercises you can perform while at your desk [<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/rttqm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/rttqm</a>].<p>I haven't used any speech recognition software, so I am afraid I can't help you there. In all honesty though, catching this early and doing something about it helps.<p>Good luck and I wish you well.",1211723209

In a family environment where parents have been honest with their children, their children were nurtured in a different way, so examples such as these are quite meaningless.<p>For the sake of argument:<p>> ""Do you like my latest bit of art? toilet roll glued to a box""<p>You're a regular Duchamp!<p>As for the multiple choice question (which is worse than a CNN poll), how about none of the above, or<p>c). (Father has already explained the situation in an honest way to his son, explaining, too, the precautions he -- and the town -- are taking to keep his son safe.)<p>In the end, though, one of the ""lies"" that parents have been telling children for ages now is the bedtime story where the children are killed to teach a harsh reality: back then, children died quite often.",1211723023

They'll be able to teach you exercises that you can do yourself to help things.<p>That is what helped me when I got what sounds like pretty similar to you: Too much guitar playing causing left hand/wrist/arm problems. Unfortunately it still isn't entirely better, but fortunately typing doesn't seem to be a problem with it.<p>Sort out your posture, wrist/hand position when typing. I'm sure someone else can point you to decent information on this.",1211722591

199496,story,,,4,4,jamess,"Ask HN: Is a distcc style plugin for professional workgroups an idea whose time has come?",,"I've been thinking about an idea for a startup for the past few days, but I have my own startup to concentrate on, so I have no time to do it. I'll offer it here for comments and if someone else chooses to do it, all to the good.<p>It occurs to me that in recent months, dual and quad core CPUs are now becoming more or less the default choice for new workstations. Typically, they'll also come with 2 or more GB of RAM. While I don't have load averages to back this up, it's my guess that the average developers CPU sits almost idle about 95% of the time. When they're writing code, browsing documentation, using the source control system or bug tracker or just at lunch or chatting idly.<p>This means that in a typical team consisting of some 10 or 12 developers, and supporting staff such as managers, architects, integration coordinators, etc. etc. You have thousands of processor cycles a second going to waste. Typically, all these workstations will be networked together on a single wired LAN segment that's considerably underutilised.<p>I think it'd be great if someone makes a decent distcc style plugin for some common dev environments like VC++, or Java/Eclipse. The plugin ought to advertise itself via zeroconf networking, and automatically utilise as much spare capacity on the network as can be found. The plugin should be smart about avoiding the user noticing that other users are compiling software on their machine. Locking itself to a single processor is a good start, and refusing jobs if the user on the local machine is compiling code or doing some other processor intensive activity.<p>Does this sound like a good idea to anyone else? In some of my past jobs, something like this would have saved me whole hours a week.",1211720486

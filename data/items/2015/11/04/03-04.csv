It states there is a correlation between a high concentration of political power and income inequality. Thus it seems absurd, even if you don&#x27;t think the former causes the latter, to believe you can solve the latter through political means.<p>> And to your point about non-coerced transactions, where does coercion start? Monopolies? Excessive costs? Does Comcast coerce their customers, if they have only no internet as the alternative? Does uber coerce people with surge pricing? And that pharma guy, raising the price of the drug, did he coerce people ? I would tend to say yes in the case of the Comcast monopoly, no in the other cases.<p>> But it&#x27;s hard to define exactly where coercion starts.<p>I think you&#x27;re having difficulty with those scenarios only because you have not first defined &quot;coercion&quot;. Google gives me this definition:<p>> the practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats.<p>To clarify my use of the word, and hopefully not completely distort the use of the word I would like to amend the definition as follows:<p>> the practice of persuading someone to do something by using violence or threats of violence.<p>When clearly defined it is clear in all of the scenarios  you raised, none of them involve coercion.",1446609204

A lot of the managers there didn&#x27;t like that story, and looked at me as the bringer of darkness or something.<p>The POS system at the Gateway stores was identical to the ones used in the call centers (from what I understood). They were absolutely not meant for retail use and were confusing as hell. The one great thing though was that you could sell people on the idea that that they could bring their computers into the store to get worked on and that work would be covered under warranty. And that was true, until they shut the stores down. I felt bad about all of those 3-5 year service plans I sold. At least they weren&#x27;t as expensive as CC or Best Buy plans.",1446609198

10504433,comment,10494512,10504145,0,0,Silhouette,,,"I&#x27;m sorry if my earlier posts weren&#x27;t clear. I mentioned the kind of scale we&#x27;re working on in another post -- the previous version is under 100K lines of code so still not really that large or complex as UIs go. But yes, it&#x27;s a little more challenging than TodoMVC. :-)<p>In any case, our current view is that there is a useful middle ground where React may work well for us. The app in question predates just about all of the modern JS UI libraries/frameworks, at least in anything close to their current forms, so much of the rendering and event management code right at the front end is built with jQuery, early toolkits, and in many cases a lot of home-grown code. All of this still works pretty well, but quite a large proportion of it is functionality that every UI library in the universe provides today, so there&#x27;s little reason to maintain another version any more. The rest of the app does have a good architecture that has stood the test of time, but for the next big update we&#x27;re trying to solve much the same issues as everyone else with managing UI code as the app grows.<p>React is of interest to us for several reasons, from being a useful templating mechanism, through providing a way of composing components that are relatively clean and modular in design, to its efficient DOM updates and declarative nature. These too are presumably the features that make it attractive to many of its users. But it is also of interest for this project precisely because its scope is tightly confined to just the rendering parts of the system and it doesn&#x27;t try to lock the whole app into its own framework.<p>We just confirmed early that some of the hype really is only that, and that scaling up to the kind of UI that has more than a few hundred data points on screen at one time is not as easy as some of the advocacy might suggest, so we&#x27;re exploring how we can use the tool to take advantage of what it clearly does offer and play to its strengths without paying too high a price. In that respect, it&#x27;s really no different to any other library we&#x27;d evaluate.",1446608175

10504303,comment,10499202,10502147,0,0,superuser2,,,">an atmosphere where failure IS acceptable<p>Ultimately, education is about competing for progressively smaller numbers of seats in progressively better lives. High school has nothing to do with &quot;learning&quot; - it&#x27;s a test, a very long one, to find out who belongs in selective colleges and who doesn&#x27;t. Colleges are, in turn, a test to find out who gets to stay in the middle class. School before HS is about learning the discipline and technique for approaching that test. But the content of both is entirely irrelevant. Its only purpose is to be difficult, so that some people can hack and and others can&#x27;t, because there isn&#x27;t room for everyone at the next stage. Some kids have to be weeded out. If you think this is a strange attitude, ask yourself why people complain so much about grade inflation.<p>There cannot <i>be</i> a situation where &quot;failure is acceptable.&quot; If you give a rational high school student an assignment that they can fail without consequences, they&#x27;ll spend their limited budget of energy and attention on one that gatekeepers care about. The only way around this in a world where comfortable livings are a scarce resource is to allocate them on some axis other than intellectual merit. For a long time we did more or less that: as long as you were white, male, and born to a &quot;good family&quot; you didn&#x27;t have to work too hard in school. Well, those days are ending, and the world is a more just place for it.<p>In a non-grade-inflated environment, &quot;failure&quot; is okay as long as you fail less than your peers. This is perhaps a better environment for the cultivation of resilience - you&#x27;re used to tests you can only make a 30% on. But then the operative kind of failure is performing worse than your peers. A lot of people on HN complain that kids these days can&#x27;t deal with being average. But I&#x27;ve never seen someone say &quot;we hire the middle 50% of developers.&quot; No. We hire the top 5.",1446606225

While you bought a house in the US someone else bought stuff from China.<p>Meanwhile the Chinese economy runs on the RMB. Has the amount of RMB in circulation been dwindling? I doubt it. While the PBoC sold down forex holdings it also reduced reserve ratio and interest rates and directly intervened through money market operations to compensate.<p>Has the total forex holdings of all Chinese entities been going down? Likely but they swapped the holdings for other assets such as real estate. It has more implications for the other markets than for China, in that the asset preference is changing from central bank assets (forex reserves holdings of PBoC invested in government bonds) to assets preferred by private investors (real estate or other assets).",1446606001

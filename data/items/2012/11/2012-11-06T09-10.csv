4747789,comment,4746368,4747109,2,0,atas,,,"I have the same age as you. One year ago I was thinking of quitting my job to turn my hobby into a business. I thought of staying in my hometown (cheap but not start-up friendly and family and friends would just see me as 'unemployed'), but I took an offer instead for a more business-oriented role to move abroad. Then one day, as a visitor in a nearby country (cheap and start-up friendly, far away from anyone I know) I saw an advertisement on the street of apartments for sale and it struck me. I now have a plan of moving to this country with cheap cost of living after I finish with my current project.<p>I always thought of leaving my country as a good way to get me started (leaving next to family would just give me a delusion of security, would make me more complacent and/or I had to deal with discouragement), but cost of living would be a factor for staying anyway.<p>Why I am saying all this? From just visiting a country as a tourist, a plan came up. And if I hadn't taken that offer maybe I would have quit. Or maybe not. And I am still considering of applying for some jobs abroad in the meantime (more waiting). But at least a more solid long-term plan has formed in the background now.",1352195809

4747777,comment,4745544,4746393,3,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"Did they really stop innovating?<p>The iPod, the iPhone and the iPad in 11 years. That's a record of innovation that stands up to pretty much any company in the last dacade and a bit. The iPad itself came out less than three years ago and they've put out four versions of it plus the iPad mini taking it from a product that no-one had made work to a product that is now tearing a major chunk out of the laptop market.<p>Maybe it's just me but I think that's quite a rate of progress. The iPad is less than three years old and people are saying ""what have they done lately?""<p>Put it in context, who is doing more? Who else has introduced just one product on that scale in the last five years? In the last ten?<p>People talk about the new innovative Microsoft but do the Surface, Windows Phone (both massively reactive plays) and Kinnect really stack up that well against what Apple are doing and have done in the same period (and I didn't mention the MacBook Air or Apple TV in there). Don't get me wrong, these are good products and it's great to see Microsoft upping their game (my background is as an MS developer and I always thought they got more criticism than they deserved so it's good to see them getting some credit).<p>Google have got Glasses which are interesting but still basically a prototype, ditto the car and Google TV which is going nowhere fast as far as I can tell. Android is a great OS but I'm not seeing the Android devices that your typical unbiased observer would sit next to an iPhone and think ""that's just in a different class"". Great phones (and now tablets) and there are certainly things that they can do that iOS can't but is it innovation on the scale of the original iPad or iPhone? It's always easier to make improvements when you're catching up as Android has been - now it's achieved parity I think we'll get to see what Android is really about. Other than that Plus is nice but hardly innovative, Hangouts likewise and from a business perspective Google remains at it's heart an advertising company.<p>I love what all these companies are doing - I love Google for Gmail, search and Reader, I love Apple hardware, I love that MS is raising it's game, I love that Samsung are making great phones that are pushing the form factor and keep Apple improving things which in turn will keep Samsung improving things (and I love my Samsung TV and the fact my iPhone is basically half Samsung components), I love what Amazon are doing with content and I love my Kindle.<p>What I don't understand is some of the lazy narratives that people want to put around these things, as if the lawsuits mean that Jonny Ive is no longer designing because he's training as a paralegal. The law suits were a dick move (almost entirely let's not forget driven by the Apple-isn't-the-same-without-him Steve Jobs - Tim Cook seems to have a far more pragmatic view on them) but I don't think they've changed a single thing Apple have been doing on the product side and I'd be really interested to see any evidence that says they have.",1352195385

So you did not want a simple serialisation because that meant slow CPU intensive save and loads.  But if you slammed it in pretty much as it would be in memeory you would win.  Downside is if you change the in memeory representation of the running program you had to change the file format.<p>And .mov would have no such concerns - it's prime use case is store data in serialised chunks anyway - it was already serialised so could use very dumb stores.",1352192830

The poor economy of US is not due to lack of innovation or capital, it's simply due to the fact that most of its low-tech jobs have been replaced by the cheap salary Asian workers such as Chinese workers! President Obama once asked Steve Jobs when he visited Apple Corp.:""Can you manufacture iphone in the US?"" And Steve replied: ""No, those jobs will never come back again"", meanwhile Apple has earned $100 billion of profit! As you all know Iphone is designed by the American genius designers, if Apple needs to employ 1000 genius designer to design Iphone, but prefer to manufacture it in China by 100,000 Chinese workers in order to earn more profit, then US will lose these 100,000 low-tech jobs only because Apple wants to earn more profit! And obviously, no matter how you train these 100,000 workers, they will never become the 1000 genius designers, and it's unnecessary to have 100,000 genius designers too! So the answer for the poor US economy and high jobless rate is so simple! It has nothing to do with innovation or capital, it's just about moving those low-tech job posts back to the US! You ask Apple President: please sacrifice a little of your profit, but move your production lines back from China to your mother land - USA! Then think what? American will have 1 more million jobs and 10 production lines overnight! That's what Apple is using to manufacture Iphones, Ipads and Ipods in China now! Only for maybe $100 or so more profit per product! Greedy capitalists, including the Apple CEO are the guys to be damned! Obviously!",1352192802

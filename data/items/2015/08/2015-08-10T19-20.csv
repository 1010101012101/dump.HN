After each operation, any terms which contribute at less than about 10^-15 are dropped, in the same way as bits get dropped after a standard floating point operation. This keeps the degree of the polynomial from growing exponentially.<p>The Chebfun team has found or invented a number of efficient algorithms for interacting with such polynomials, which make it practical to find roots, take integrals and derivatives, solve differential equations, combine multiple functions in various ways, and so on.<p>I think it must be the largest Matlab library anyone has yet built, and while I’m not the biggest fan of Matlab, they’ve done a great job integrating with the environment. Turns out Matlab has a bunch of object oriented features with operator and function overloading, so Chebfun can adopt most of the operators and functions for operating on regular Matlab arrays and overload them to work on their continuous function approximations. This makes for very clean and readable code for their users, though the internals get pretty complex.<p>Also recommended is Trefethen’s book Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice, which explains the mathematical ideas underlying the library.

The fact that we don&#x27;t need to assume group axioms hold, but can instead <i>prove</i> they hold for at least one structure is a huge distinction. There is no way to prove there are models of ZFC or another (suitably powerful) foundational system without appealing to a foundational system in the first place. That is the content of Godel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem[1]. So the axioms of ZFC bear some scrutiny, while those of a group etc. don&#x27;t. This is a completely technical distinction.<p>> That argument would be a lot more compelling if Mathematicians formalized their arguments in terms of an underlying foundations, because then we would always know that all assumptions are checked.<p>But they do! You can find many books on real analysis that prove that the reals exist from the foundation, as well as proving that the naturals and integers exist on the way. They don&#x27;t constantly refer to the foundations, but they use facts that have been rigorously proved from the foundations. And although they don&#x27;t write &quot;axiom schema of specification&quot; every time they consider a subset satisfying a property, that doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t know that it is required.<p>> In short, what matters is that people accept the incorrect fact and move forward from it, NOT whether that incorrectness comes from foundations or from something built on top of them. The impact of either depends entirely upon how many people trust the result and build on top of it.<p>My whole point is that you don&#x27;t have to trust the group axioms, because they can (and typically are) validated relative to ZFC. Since the trivial group can be constructed within ZFC they are consistent in ZFC, full stop. The same goes for refinements like commutative groups. If the group axioms lead to a inconsistency, it can only be because ZFC itself is inconsistent. Do you not think that being a possible source of inconsistency or not is an important distinction?<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#Second_incompleteness_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_...</a>",1439236043

Otherwise, they wouldn&#x27;t be trading in the first place. This results because people have different utility functions. A farmer might be willing to buy insurance that gives him negative expected value, because his utility function incorporates a larger risk term than the insurer. A fur trapper sells furs to a buyer because 1 pelt is not scarce to him. With derivative contracts this analogy gets a bit abstract, but the justifications hold.<p>Liquidity providers add liquidity to the market precisely because they think that the rebates are &quot;worth more&quot; than the liquidity they are providing. A liquidity taker might still fill their trade because they have a different utility function. The net gain for society would be the net gain in total utility, if we were somehow able to convert them into normalized units.<p>However, if the liquidity taker is a nearly identical firm with a nearly identical utility function, then that implies that the liquidity provider and taker disagree over who is on the losing side of the trade. One party has better information or luck than the other and the future eventually reveals which was the better choice.<p>To put it another way, I believe it is a zero sum game if players with identical utility functions (i.e. two small prop shops with $200K book) trade with each other. Both probably have identical utility functions, and future events will reveal whether buying or selling was the correct choice in terms of utility. There are quite a number of such players swimming in the market, so there is a zero-sum game of &quot;who knows more&quot; that goes on underneath the actual net utility provided by liquid markets.",1439235703

The cases where crackerdom and hackerdom overlap (including the cases that the article describes, like &quot;Cap&#x27;n Crunch&quot;) tend to share that &quot;chaotic neutral&quot; alignment; the differences between a grey-hat cracker and a hacker are often nonexistent in this particular sense (though differences may arise based on ingenuity; for example, a grey-hat cracker might not be a hacker if one relies heavily on existing information (i.e. a &quot;script kiddie&quot;) instead of seeking to discover new things for oneself).",1439235211

And my experience tells me it&#x27;s a Best Practice. `Bartweiss gives a good overview of it, but I&#x27;ll share some advice I got from an engineering greybeard (which I most definitely am not).<p>He had a great story to go with this, but the TLDR is that the PoC is the safe choice when applied to engineering: give a true, best-faith effort to prove the opposing view correct. (And best-faith is important: you can <i>not</i> approach it with bias, lest you waste everyone&#x27;s time.) If you&#x27;re right, then you&#x27;ll find an irrefutable flaw in the engineering, and if you&#x27;re wrong you&#x27;ve learned something new.<p>If it sounds like a lot of effort, it is.<p>But this is also utterly win-win. It&#x27;s a way of assuring that you&#x27;ve been careful. Avoiding the humiliation of hubris is great if a detail of the implementation was missed at first glance. But you also will inevitably more fully understand the problem when you&#x27;ve failed to implement the opposing view; it also puts you in the excellent position to graciously be on the same side as your opponent and now you can sway your now-ally-in-war in their reasoning. In either way, your goal <i>must</i> be to solve the problem, and not merely &quot;win&quot; political points.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s crackpot theories and stupid ideas and foolish plans which should be dismissed with prejudice. But hopefully you&#x27;re working in a professional environment where your coworkers really are trying their best to succeed. <i>And even then</i>, a serious engineer will still give the stupid ideas at least some (small) time of day, as you <i>must</i> have a reason for all decisions, even dismissals; as you become experienced, you&#x27;ll be able to properly dismiss these faster and more precisely, but you&#x27;ll still need to go through the process. That process is what separates the people who loudly proclaim they are smart and right from those who would testify in court they are right.<p>(Incidentally, this is part of the reason why I get immensely frustrated with &quot;idea people&quot;, as it takes <i>much</i> more work to flesh out their half-assed ideas into full-assed ideas. Non-engineers don&#x27;t get that there&#x27;s a huge amount of effort to constantly take everything and everyone seriously.)",1439235166

This is usually as simple as, eg.:<p><pre><code>    class DoSomethingWithPermission < ActiveRecord::Migration
      class Permission < ActiveRecord::Base; end

      # ...
    end
</code></pre>
It protects you from all sorts of tomfoolery – changes to the class name, its relationships, its validations, etc. – and doesn&#x27;t require any change in style.<p>I also love the idea of migrations being forward-only, and deployed on their own (ie. without accompanying code changes). If you can pull it off, those constraints give rise to some nice properties: schema changes must work with existing deployed code, code changes must work with existing deployed schema, deploys can be done with zero downtime, botched schema changes can be fixed without rolling back code changes, etc. It is harder to do than the traditional style, requiring schema changes to be made in phases, and often involving triggers and/or views to keep things consistent, so its cost/benefit isn&#x27;t necessarily a clear win.",1439233917

I have a nest egg, I have a good salary, I also have a wife, children, a small farm that we run, mountains, deserts and oceans to explore, stars to look at, etc.<p>As a young person (26), what looks like a pursuit for wealth from the outside is just me trying to get to this stability point so I can slow down. :) I don&#x27;t even live in an area with absurd housing costs and I still feel like that&#x27;s a distant dream if I keep on keeping on at my dayjob.<p>Reinventing the wheel?

Example: CSS. sounds great until you want something centered. XAML is even worse - it&#x27;s really powerful, so you try to fly too close to the sun.<p>I honestly think that doing UI layout in the same programming language as UI logic, and manually choosing a set of &quot;manager tunable&quot; parameters to put in a dead-simple config file, is the way to go. Which is more or less exactly what is described here.<p>If the UI logic language is expressive enough, you can still make a nice declarative DSL for GUIs. Then, when you <i>inevitably</i> need some complex UI behavior that can&#x27;t be expressed declaratively, you don&#x27;t have to deal with a language boundary.",1439233549

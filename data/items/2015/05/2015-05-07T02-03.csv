He had to tell me to request it from my primary care doc, because according to the worldview of American health insurance a psychiatrist is not qualified to order said lab test. My primary care doc gave me a questionnaire. My score was just below the threshold where the lab test is considered warranted. He told me he&#x27;d figure out how to make it work. I guess he did, because I got the test, got it interpreted by ${DOMAIN_EXPERT}, and got a prescription for treatment that seems to be working pretty well (albeit not perfectly).",1430967581

9503021,comment,9502049,9502049,0,0,epidemian,,,"Finally read this paper a couple of days ago. Even though i thought i already understood the concepts of higher order functions and laziness, and had used them on my every-day programming, the paper was still quite enlightening.<p>One of the things i hadn&#x27;t considered before is how much laziness can help to build modular code. The last section in the paper, about implementing the minimax algorithm, is a great example of this. The `evaluate` function is first naively defined as a simple chain of a couple of functions that iterate the tree of all possible game positions. Then a series of improvements are applied to it (e.g. pruning the tree to allow the algorithm to work on infinite trees, or ignoring branches that cannot yield favourable moves), but what&#x27;s really nice is that thanks to lazy evaluation these improvements can be implemented as independent functions that are just &quot;plugged in&quot; the chain, without having to modify the original functions. For example, the original function that generates the whole game tree doesn&#x27;t need to be changed to implement pruning.<p>I&#x27;d really recommend the paper to anyone who might be wondering &quot;why all this fuss about functional programming?&quot;. It&#x27;s not only very accessible, but also full of beautiful code examples solving very practical and concrete problems. I personally felt a bit sad having to &quot;back&quot; to the imperative programming world in my every-day job after reading it.",1430966167

But so right, in my view.<p>One of the benefits of the long term view is that it forces you to address sustainability, so you focus on real revenue.<p>Our startup is now 6 years old. We decided early on that chasing funding meant focussing on the wrong thing, and that we would suck up the pain of little income and slower growth. Being able to focus on the product instead of investors was great, but that slower growth also turned out to be healthy. It meant a better relationship with our first customers, which lead to more useful feedback, a better product, and organic growth that this year will give me 4 times the best salary I ever earned before.<p>And it&#x27;s still fun - as well as the financial compensation, we still control 100% of the company so we can do things our own way. We employed one of our support people in a city hit by a devastating earthquake; we carried an agent for a few months while she escaped an abusive marriage; we make a sizeable donation to a kids&#x27; charity in lieu of sending out Christmas cards.",1430965684

The remaining question, legally, is whether Uber is offering drivers a &quot;job&quot;, as opposed to a software platform that they can use to be self-employed as drivers (which is Uber&#x27;s argument).<p>If Uber is offering jobs to drivers, then certain standards must be met to avoid illegal employment practices. Then the next question is whether or not Uber actually violates those standards. The answer might be that it doesn&#x27;t, life can be pretty thought for people in many professions that we have actually deemed &#x27;fair enough&#x27; work. But if the answer is that it does, then Uber needs to change.<p>If &#x27;the sharing economy&#x27; is not actually creating employer-employee relations, then it might still need to be regulated (perhaps under different regulations than labor laws), depending what society thinks of the mechanism as a whole. For example, if drivers are self-employed contractors rather than employees, then what gives Uber the rights to fix their wages? Is there such a thing as minimum wage for independent contractors? Who is responsible for things like health insurance for Uber drivers? We have plenty of answers for these questions for the kind of independent contractor that makes $50 an hour, not for the kind that makes $17 a ride. But again, it might well be that the deal as it is can be actually considered fair, compared with for example being a street market vendor or a temp worker at a convenience store. I certainly have met plenty of part-time/retired drivers in the South Bay that consider the deal a fair enough source of extra cash. The point is that we haven&#x27;t figured out whether or not it is exploitative and that is the sort of question modern developed societies can afford to ask themselves and weight against the benefit of &#x27;it creates some value for some people and pays the bills for some others&#x27;.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll add that I use ride-sharing services often, want them to continue to exist in some useful form and am firm believer of &#x27;default allow&#x27; as it comes to new business models.

9502935,story,,,24,31,taurenk,"Ask HN: Why am I having a hard time finding a new job?",,"For the past few months I have been trying to find a new job and I can’t seem to find the right position one way or another. I have gotten pretty far in the hiring process with some large well known companies, the trend seems to be “we really really like you, we just don’t think your ready” type of deal.<p>Currently, I work for a healthcare company doing a little of everything in IT/IS. I administer systems, do analytics on large sets of claim, member and provider data, ETL work, SQL development, new system implementation, and now long term IT strategy. I even do a ton of python scripting/dev for analytics and large projects.<p>On top of working 40+ hours I started to teach myself some new things. I picked up Python/Flask/PostgreSQL about 8 months ago and built out a Geocoding service using Census data. After interviewing for some Java engineer positions and not making the cut, I started to rewrite the geocoding REST service in Java/Spring/Hibernate.  I even started to pick up Angular so I could make a decent UI in order to show off my work.<p>I really would love to become a software engineer – I love solving problems, creating, designing, etc. Trying to switch from what I do now to that type of  role has been extremely frustrating. Recruiters seem to think it’s impossible for me to switch and I haven’t gotten much hits for anything close to what I want to be doing.<p>I’m hoping someone could offer some advice on what to do! I’ve attached a link to my resume and github – maybe I am not marketing myself properly?<p>https://github.com/taurenk

Based on my experience with suicidality, the &quot;BS&quot; isn&#x27;t what actually prompts the suicidal thoughts. Rather, it&#x27;s post-hoc rationalization for the irrational feeling of having no future worth experiencing. In a broader sense, this is something that people do all the time: we experience an emotion, then try to explain it after-the-fact. Our brains are incredibly adept at inventing &quot;reasons&quot; for experiences and sensations that ultimately stem from bizarre defects of biology and other caprices of circumstance. The mythologies associated with sleep paralysis (the hag, incubi/succubi, alien abduction) are perhaps the most vivid examples of this phenomenon.",1430964062

In terms of breaking down the tasks needed to build the final product, early Ford factories were just as efficient as modern Foxconn assembly plants.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing whether it&#x27;s a fact or not. Culturally, in 2015 America it&#x27;s a fact. In 1915 America, the same &quot;fact&quot; would have been handily rejected, even by conservative minds. Most people only read the first chapter of Wealth of Nations where Adam Smith extolls the virtues of the division of labor. The second half of the book, where he warns that the division of labor taken to the extreme could result in unfathomable social ills, and we ought not ever travel down that path, is usually conveniently ignored.<p>I&#x27;m all for automating jobs that technology deems unnecessary. The solution isn&#x27;t to push everyone into some multi-disciplinary creative class. Many people would be very happy as uber drivers, or any other menial job, if they were treated with respect by their employer. I&#x27;d say the solution begins with treating workers with dignity and respect.",1430964017

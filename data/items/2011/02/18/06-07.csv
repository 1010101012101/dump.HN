There are plenty of day laborers who wait in the morning at ""The Corner"", and people with jobs for the day come pick them up. They work when they are able, and when there is a job for them. Regardless of whether or not this is legal, the market for this already exists, and it frankly isn't that great for employees. The benefit of a steady job -- or more accurately, a steady stream of income -- is that you can plan around it.<p>Also, I fail to see how regulation has prevented this from happening. Do you have any evidence you could point to? Lots of businesses have a big payroll of part-timers who only work a few hours a week. Speaking from personal experience, when I used to work these kinds of jobs many of my coworkers (myself included) had extremely flexible ""work when you can"" schedules. Lots of transient employees, too. For some industries this works, but for most non-minimum wage jobs frankly I don't see what the incentive for an employer to do this would be.",1298012115

2234506,comment,2232595,2232595,0,0,eengstrom,,,"+1 for the reschedule in San Francisco.<p>Common experience is that once an employer knows you're stepping out and interviewing, you're already out. Especially if you haven't informed them you're looking, or at least asked them basic questions like: ""I'm feeling limited in my role, do you have any ideas of how I can expand responsibility or learn new X""? If it's about money, bring that up and see what they say.<p>People can feel very betrayed when someone they like or value departs or plays games, for good reason, since obviously you don't value your current opportunity as much as your new one. Think of it like an intimate relationship. Especially in such a small company where you represent over 14% of the work force.<p>Interviewing while employed is something we'll all have to do once or more in our careers (especially in tech). Being graceful and honorable is fine, but at the end of the day, if you try and live a righteous life, you're going to find out that most people don't act like that. Especially when they feel betrayed.<p>However. Doing the right thing and protecting yourself does not give you the right to discharge your responsibilities. Certainly not something I would look for in a new hire.<p>If you haven't done so yet, explain, or even forward a sanitized agenda from Monday's meeting. Explain you can't make it as desired (Monday is a holiday I think), let your employers know you need personal time off after the demo and handle things like an adult.<p>As others have said several times, the new company will wait a day or two for you.<p>Your best bet is to knock the demo out of the park, show your value to your current employer and take the new offer with pride. You treat your old employer right when you run out of town to San Francisco, the better chance you'll have a reference or a job back there if things don't work out here.<p>Another thing to keep in mind if you're relatively new and only worked in small companies. In such a small setting, in such a lowered cost of living location like (anywhere in) Texas, you'll have a lot more work-habit related freedoms than in a larger organization.",1298010824

The reality is: often cities' homelessness departments are prime locations for employing cronies and operatives.<p>For example: the City of San Francisco spends $70M per year (about $10K per homeless person, given that the population of the homeless is just under 7K). On top of that you have churches and other charities helping out. And yet I see homeless people all around, sleeping in doorways, on sidewalks, etc. Heck, in the shadow of City Hall you'll see dozens of homeless people.<p>But the department of homelessness (I don't recall the name of the department) was filled with people from (ex-mayor) Gavin Newsom's campaign staff (from his unsuccessful run for Governor). There is no accountability. There are no metrics on how many homeless people are in the City. All we have is a massive bureaucracy that is making a living off of claiming to help homeless people.",1298010553

I can tell from reading your post that you are clearly struggling with this.<p>While I do agree with portman's advice below as it clearly shows experience and thoughtfulness, I disagree with most comments in this thread on several principles:<p>1. I hire quickly, trusting instinct. \n2. I fire very slowly, if at all.<p>One key trick to understanding humans and being successful with them is that despite marketing demographics we are all motivated differently and relate and filter things differently.<p>Each time you make a decision to let someone go, ask yourself whether the employee failed or whether you did as their manager and leader. There are clear cases where a person shouldn't be in your organization, but practice and experience has taught me time and again that an employee's failure is the direct result of bad leadership, laziness or a lack of character - in the manager.<p>Clearly the person was qualified enough to obtain the position. Everything after that is up to the managers and leaders in your organization. If the person just isn't fitting in, can't offer value for the cost, at least make sure after you've sacked them that you understand what about that person misled you in the hiring process.<p>Years ago I built several organizations and led each for over a year. One hire of the last company constantly irritated me, I mean really, constantly bounced up and down on my last nerve, cutting away with a hacksaw...<p>1. I was not understanding what this employee needed from me to be successful in assignments, or even about what I expected in terms of work ethics and acceptable use of time at work.<p>2. The employee understood that I was dissatisfied but I was giving him mixed messages by not being frank with him. I was trying to over manage his problem, which wasn't a technique that worked.<p>3. I was not fair with this person because I treated him the same way as the rest of the team. A big mistake considering that two team members were total rock stars, upbeat, proactive, interested and fully aware of how lucky they were to have their position. I really, simply, didn't know him nor did I really make time to get to know what made him tick.<p>So I started to work on his separation process and as a part of it, I pulled a few members of the team aside and asked them what they thought. No one really had a problem with him, except that, shockingly enough, he didn't seem to understand my direction and wasn't able to make progress.<p>One of my .. hah .. junior developers said to me, ""Hey, Robert is just the kind of guy that needs a list."". Since Robert was on a team of people that generally needed less input that the rest of my departments, I was kind of put off by such simple feedback.<p>So, I started shifting assignments to Robert that were moment to moment, short tasks and within weeks we had his productivity up, I had learned a valuable method of evaluation and had realized fundamental gaps in my own skills and abilities as a leader. Within a month, Robert had taken over as a team floater and input/output guy. The entire technology wing of the company came to rely on him five or six times a day; when you're building a tech and a market at the same time under pressure and on tight budgets, this was invaluable.<p>Basically Robert became the technology group's go to guy for anything from packing up deployments to testing functionality to scripting self-tests. You name it. The key was understanding that Robert needed short term accomplishments, measurable tasks and in a short period of time, he and I and his manager learned a very rewarding style of working together.<p>At the end of the day, properly utilized and managed, Robert became a star in his own right. If engaged, he would easily get jobs done faster than anyone else in the company, and while needing more maintenance and direction than other team members, he was a huge savings in time and distraction for so many others.<p>Don't fire your guy until you've had a chance to analyze why there is a breakdown. You're doing yourself, your initial impulse on hiring him, and the employee a disservice.",1298009350

However, what I _am_ saying is that you still need humans to verify the results - we do have automatic theorem provers already, but we still need to make sure that the steps are logical.</i><p>At some point, I fail to see why you need the humans.  What value are humans actually providing?<p><i>Not only that, but the theorem needs to connote something useful.</i><p>Mathematicians already have a concept of ""useful"" that is so far at odds with the common understanding of the term that I honestly cannot make sense of what ""useful"" actually means in this context.  If the program is able to tackle actual difficult research problems, and has heuristics that suffice for real problems, then its notion of ""useful"" is probably good enough for practice.<p><i>Also, we tend to use axioms that we can't say are consistent within the system (for instance, the axiom of choice; yet, mathematicians use it like candy in order to show useful results in analysis, and weird, unintuitive results in topology [slicing a sphere and producing two spheres with the same volume.])</i><p>Outside of logic, most of mathematics has agreed on the set of axioms to use.  Namely ZFC.  As for using axioms that are not consistent within the system, that is absolutely necessary by the incompleteness theorem.  Though you picked an ironically bad example.  Gödel proved that ZF is consistent if and only if ZFC is consistent, and therefore the axiom of choice does not affect the consistency of the axiom system.  It might not describe the set theory we want to describe, but it does not lead to contradictions.<p><i>I understand that the article is saying, ""yes, such a proof produced by a computer still needs to be independently verified."" To be honest, I think a system that could make mistakes and whatnot is not necessarily what people would want to see - reason being that mathematicians probably have not much trouble trying to figure out the larger details and overall plan of attack.</i><p>That was one of the weaker points made.  I see the value of having heuristics that can go astray.  But if you've got this in a computer, hook the heuristics up to a theorem prover that can fill in the details and come up with verified theorems.  And which can alternately can describe useful plans of attacks.<p><i>I understand that the article is saying, ""yes, such a proof produced by a computer still needs to be independently verified."" To be honest, I think a system that could make mistakes and whatnot is not necessarily what people would want to see - reason being that mathematicians probably have not much trouble trying to figure out the larger details and overall plan of attack.</i><p>Until people trust the computer, it absolutely needs to be double-checked.  Any piece of software can have horrible bugs that are hard to find.  No matter how confident its designers are, it needs verification.<p><i>The reason why I'm doubtful that we'd ever see such an AI for proving math statements is because the entire enterprise is still very much a creative one - you not only have to generate the logical forms somehow, but also figure out whether it gets you closer to your goal or not. I suppose you could have some sort of heuristic that could show that a generated theorem or lemma could in fact get you closer to your goal, but my god, math is filled with so many potholes and garden paths that could lead one astray.</i><p>Yes, it looks as far away from being possible now as beating Jeopardy looked back when Deep Blue beat Kasparov.  Based on my experience with mathematics and computing I find myself in agreement with rjlipton that it is not impossible, and in fact I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen within 15 years.<p>Here is an interesting back of the envelope calculation for you.  A human brain has 100 billion neurons, each of which has 7000 connections, and fires about every tenth of a second.  Let's suppose that emulation averages 1000 clock cycles per synapse.  The result is that simulating something as complex as the human brain in real time should take on the order of 10<i></i>11 * 7000 * 1000 = 7<i>10</i><i>17 clock cycles per second.  Watson was running at 8</i>10<i></i>12 clock cycles per second.  If Moore's Law continues to hold for 16 generations, which is 24 years, then a computer the size of Watson should be able to match the human brain, in real time.<p>Once we have the hardware, I think it is only a question of time until the necessary software is available.  And given the demonstrated power of statistical analysis of large data sets to real problems (think Watson, Google translate, and the like), I think we're on our way to developing appropriate software as well.<p><i>Don't get me wrong, it'd be awesome to see such a system - however, I'm very doubtful that such a system could ever be created, and if it is created, that it'd be actually useful to practicing mathematicians.</i><p>I think that rjlipton is a little optimistic on the time frame.  But I fully expect to see it arrive in my lifetime.  I have some trepidation about the inevitable economic upheaval when it does happen.",1298008992

If they could get minimum wage jobs, they would, and they'd quickly not be homeless.<p>But they can't because students and recent graduates and stay at home moms, etc, get the minimum wage jobs.<p>If we eliminated the minimum wage, then all the jobs that need doing, but whose economic value is $2.75 an hour would come into being.   This means that the homeless person would be able to earn that $1,300 in two months.  If low cost housing were legalized, they'd be able to live cheaply while getting on their feet and saving for getting a better job.<p>Minimum wage is the idea that we'd rather have someone homeless and not working at $0 an hour than have them have a home and be digging themselves out working for $2.50 an hour.",1298008895

Five years?<p>Based on the (admittedly not extensive) work I've done trying to help homeless folks get back on their feet, a lot of people do just need some money to get their life back in order. For instance, it's hard to apply for jobs when you don't have an address or a phone number for people to call you back at. Giving someone the ability to not have to worry about making their rent payment for a couple months can be huge.<p>But a significant portion of the cases I've seen can't be solved this simply. Despite what this article says substance abuse issues /are/ a big factor for a lot of the homeless people I've worked with. Providing cash money can alleviate some of their problems in the short term, but there are generally more fundamental obstacles that are holding people back. If you don't address these issues people can very easily fall back into the trap.<p>The best intervention I've ever seen for a homeless person is an employer who is willing to give them a steady job and be understanding about the difficulty of the situation they're going through. Anything that can get a homeless person to this point should be encouraged. Sometimes that can mean covering their expenses for a while to get back on their feet. But often it means providing substance abuse support; often it means teaching job skills; often it means connecting them with the right social service or civil society groups.",1298008819

6488087,comment,6487661,6487661,2,0,domid,,,"I think a large part of identifying a successful leader in a company is to see if he/she has the potential to lead. A leader should be able to excite others around an idea and convince them to follow and devote their time and energy. This is difficult to do early on, specifically if there is no money involved. In not being able to find a co-founder you are basically saying, you can&#x27;t or you don&#x27;t want one/need one. If you can&#x27;t, that might be identified as a negative trait. If you don&#x27;t want one or feel you don&#x27;t need one, I would encourage you to reconsider. There is nothing like having someone beside you, you can fully trust, and talk openly with about your problems and frustrations.<p>Working on a startup is something like swimming in an ocean with a one mattress that&#x27;s loosing air. You need to swim to an island which is far far away, and although the mattress might have enough air to help you rest from time to time, there is a big chance everything might go wrong. Sure you can do it alone if you try hard enough, but there is a bigger risk of you getting there to late or not getting there at all. With 2 or more co-founders, you have someone beside you can trust, and that might allow you to rest, or plan out a strategy so you all get to you destination sooner than anyone else. Trust me when I tell you, you aren&#x27;t the only one swimming in the same direction.<p>I&#x27;m sure you can find a handful of companies that had one founder and succeeded, but the odds of them succeeding are just much much smaller and it is a bigger risk most investors want to avoid.",1380797413

The focus on American people and US constitution is a single viable path to constructively battle the unlawful demands.<p>If it is ruled that Lavabit can not be extorted for private data of its users, it&#x27;s a win for any user out there.<p>On a side note, I feel saddened that this event does not attract more attention. More so, you happen to see people scrutinize Lavabit and pick on various details of this case.<p>But think about it. Lavabit is, to my knowledge, the only company that took an open stand for its users and went so far as to shut down its service to protect users private data.<p>Somehow, it&#x27;s not exciting enough for many. Instead, the recent news of the &quot;Google Ad Designer&quot; got almost 1k points and spent more than a day on the front page. Same company who sold its users quietly, without a single word. Who could have also taken a stand and even shut down GMail, if they had enough guts and moral integrity. Imagine the social impact of this move. It could have very well turn the tide. Yet, the only action they took is one press release to deny any allegations and one motion to allow for full FISA orders statistics be published.

6488059,comment,6487661,6487661,9,0,akbar501,,,"I&#x27;ll answer this based on my experiences:<p>0. Having a team where everyone is committed is ideal. It&#x27;s very difficult to run a company by yourself (beyond a very small operation). Finding a co-founder should not be driven by YC, VCs, etc. A co-founder is about the success of your company. Is it absolutely necessary, no. Does having a good partner greatly increase your chances of success, yes.<p>1. Should you settle for a sub-optimal co-founder? No. Starting a company with someone is a long-term commitment. It&#x27;s like marriage in so many ways, so you should take your time and find the right match to grow your business. On the other hand, don&#x27;t set your standards so high that you&#x27;re stuck doing everything on your own forever. Basically, know what characteristics you need in your co-founder so that the company&#x27;s success is maximized.<p>Also, put in effort to find the right co-founder. Get out there, talk to people, let people know you&#x27;re in the market. And don&#x27;t be afraid to date before marriage. There are many ways to start working together. You can start with a consulting arrangement, then grow to co-founder after verifying that everyone can really work well together.<p>2. Should you share equity with someone who joins late?\nThe work you put in before finding a co-founder or getting an investment is not highly relevant. First, think of this as if you&#x27;re the 2nd co-founder. Would you be ok taking a smaller stake for the next 2, 4, 10 years just because the other person did a few months work before you joined?<p>Building a company is about the future. That&#x27;s what everyone is rewarded for. If a late joining co-founder helps grow the startup from a pre-revenue company into a company with millions in monthly revenue then they do deserve to be richly rewarded for their contribution.<p>3. Think past YC, past funding.\nMake decisions that will optimize the value and growth of your company. YC is a 3 month program. You&#x27;ll be done with it before you know it. Funding is an event. When it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s done. Imagine you&#x27;re now done with YC and you&#x27;ve been funded. What type of co-founder do you need to grow your idea into a large company?",1380797048

I know that &quot;everyone does this&quot;, and &quot;this is how it&#x27;s always been&quot;, but morally speaking whether a person is a citizen of one country or another has no impact on whether it is justified to spy on them. As a collective society humanity has to grow up and leave this stuff behind.<p>Fundamentally these problems trace back to the nation state, which itself is an inherently discriminatory instrument. It assigns special privileges to people based on where they were born. If we as a species believe that everyone should have access to equal rights and equal opportunities, then there can be no international borders arbitarily cutting up the landscape of rights and opportunities. The nation state was a tool that was useful in humanity&#x27;s adolescence, but we have to leave it behind if we ever want to grow up.<p>Not that any of that is easy, but just because something is hard doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t necessary.",1380796347
6488031,comment,6475148,6483172,1,0,tripzilch,,,"Thanks, that was pretty good, thanks for saying that.<p>And I do like many/most Americans that I&#x27;ve met, it&#x27;s just that the discourse on this subject on HN had started feeling a little bit one-sided. As I said, I wasn&#x27;t trying to single you out, it was something that had been bubbling under my skin for a while now (and others too).<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, if my government was spying in NK, the way yours is intercepting, recording, cataloguing and datamining the lives of all (Internet/technology-using) humans on this planet, I would in fact <i>not</i> be okay with this. Because it&#x27;s no way to treat people, anywhere. As we&#x27;ve seen every single time, just because something that is actually wrong seems justifiable, doesn&#x27;t mean it should be done because it&#x27;ll just lower the threshold for it to be used again in situations where you wouldn&#x27;t agree with it. Because you can&#x27;t close that door, you can&#x27;t say &quot;I trust your judgement, <i>this time</i>&quot;, because in a few years it&#x27;ll be somebody else making that call, and the machinery is already there.<p>Of course irony has it that not even the US gov is spying on NK in that manner, because they can&#x27;t really get a useful intelligence foothold in that place. So the comparison doesn&#x27;t actually quite work, because they&#x27;re doing all this very deep hard-core intercepting/recording/datamining on pretty much all places <i>except</i> NK, and a few others that you might consider &quot;justified&quot;. Why is it that the places where they far exceeded the boundaries of what can be reasoned as &quot;justifiable intelligence&quot; are in fact not the places where it might actually matter? <i>Because they were allies.</i> The UK hacked Belgium, FFS! It is an abuse of trust. For what, for nothing, well I&#x27;m guessing for business intelligence.<p>So yeah, that&#x27;s a bit of a conundrum. With &quot;national security&quot; and all. Some tough choices maybe? But really, nobody said it would be easy. If you&#x27;re dealing in global politics, affecting the lives of billions of people all over the world, all with different attitudes and beliefs, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re signing up for. And there is no easy way out, 100% &quot;Total Information Awareness&quot; isn&#x27;t a solution, for similar reasons as &quot;let&#x27;s bomb the ever-loving shit out of everybody&quot; is not (as the US seems to be slowly learning).<p>See, the Dutch NSA, called AIVD, is doing just as bad. At some point they were tapping more phones than the US. If you buy Bitcoin you&#x27;re on a list. They are already tracking our locations via the cellphones and &quot;invisible text messages&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot; knows what. It&#x27;s pretty bad. But they&#x27;re doing it to just these 17M people and it&#x27;s our problem. This is why I donate money to Bits of Freedom, which is like the Dutch version of the EFF. One thing they&#x27;re very good at, is informing politicians what all this new-fangled technology can do, so they can make better choices. So I hope B.o.F. can put some brakes on that. <i>However,</i> if my government were to turn its eyes outward, and decide it can just invade and intercept the personal lives of, well, anybody guilty of the crime of not being a Dutch citizen, I&#x27;d <i>damn well</i> be outraged, and expect my gov to cut it the hell out. (&quot;Some of my best friends aren&#x27;t Dutch citizens!!&quot;, Americans, in fact). And I&#x27;d demand that even though B.o.F. is a Dutch foundation, they&#x27;ll work to put a stop to that as well even if it doesn&#x27;t directly affect Dutch citizens.<p>Because, really, should allies have to be protecting their citizens from each other? Well they should protect their citizens, that&#x27;s one thing a government is for, but ostensibly the point of having allies is that you&#x27;re not trying to screw one another over.<p>Okay, and sorry this is getting a bit long, but I must point out that it is in fact more complicated than this :) Now it seems like I say just the US is screwing over its allies (and I also said the UK was). But part of the reality of the situation is also that many of these both-heavily-spied-upon-as-well-as-allied countries, are in fact governments screwing over their own citizens, with agreements that say basically &quot;you spy on my back, I&#x27;ll spy on yours&quot;. Which is <i>another</i> reason why you need to look past your own boundaries instead of asking/expecting your gov to better protect just <i>your</i> privacy. Because they don&#x27;t really want to. And they use the excuse of spying on other countries as a distraction. As has been pointed out many times already, in the US there&#x27;s some things in your Constitution that says, if anyone was listening, roughly that they shouldn&#x27;t spy on US citizens for no good reason. That is why they have the deals with other countries, we can&#x27;t legally spy on our own people, so you spy on ours, we spy on yours, deal? (this has been the case since ECHELON, it&#x27;s right there on Wikipedia).<p>And THAT, is why you should not just expect your government to protect you from the other spying eyes, but why you should <i>demand</i> that they stop the type of intrusive surveillance / intercepting / recording / datamining they&#x27;re doing to others as well. Because you&#x27;re not alone in this world. Or, if only, to view from an economical perspective again, it removes the bargaining chip, if they don&#x27;t have the deep intelligence on their &quot;allies&quot; they cannot trade it back for the deep intelligence that they are legally prohibited from gathering on their own citizens.",1380796338

The number of hours? As many as it takes, whilst it&#x27;s still fun to do. It usually takes 5-10 hours to do the basic stuff (strategy and on-site optimization), and then another 10-50 to initiate the harder stuff (developing content and building backlinks).<p>I will examine your site or product, develop a complete SEO strategy, give you tips and clues on what needs to be corrected on your site, do keyword research and develop content for your site - eventually starting the grind job of building backlinks.<p>Who am I?<p>I&#x27;m a SEO professional making $170K a year doing SEO work. SEO is one of my main passions in life. I love logical link hierarchies, finding new sources of backlinks, explaining the importance of digital distribution of content to newbies, doing technical SEO and seeing Google gradually index a site. I also own 10-20 sites with Pagerank ranging from 4 to 6. My own sites attract 150-200.000 visitors per week, largely because of SEO. I earn $14.000 USD in Adsense per month, again largely because of SEO.<p>Why the deal?<p>I like to meet fellow entrepreneurs around the world.

You can use signatures for verification and mix-nets or homomorphic encryption for anonymity. There are plenty of security risks in practical implementations of electronic voting, but I would not say &quot;definitely not possible&quot;. Not saying I trust the system being discussed or that I think we should have mass online elections just yet, but this is an area under research and the results look more in the direction of &quot;likely feasible&quot; rather than &quot;likely unfeasible&quot;. Which is actually quite important if we are ever going to move towards any form of democracy more direct/gradual than voting every X years for people who vote on the actual decisions.<p>Note that the paper voting systems are also quite hackable in practice. It is actually pretty hard to track your own vote and make sure it was counted correctly, that the votes in all districts were added correctly and, when you find your vote miscounted, proving fraud is quite hard as well.

The US is one of the most battle-tested military forces in the world, has relatively little corruption compared to China, and yet it still suffers from projects like the F-35. It&#x27;s hard to estimate how effectively that Chinese budget is being employed.<p>The EU isn&#x27;t sending a military force into Ukraine, but then neither is the US. The EU does have problematic energy ties to Russia, but that works both ways; just as Europe has an unhealthy dependency on Russian gas, Russia has an even greater dependency on Europe.<p>Putin&#x27;s playing a dangerous game with the EU. On the one hand, the EU relies on Russia for about a third of its gas and petroleum. On the other hand, Russia depends on the EU for the majority its energy exports, and virtually all its gas exports. The EU doesn&#x27;t need to go to war with Russia to cripple it; Russia&#x27;s economy currently depends on the EU accepting its imports.<p>Ukraine is a difficult problem to solve. Sure, the EU could march in and reclaim Ukrainian territory without much resistance. The Russian army may have a lot of equipment, but most of it is outdated, and the first Iraq war proved how overwhelming an advantage a technology gap can be. But the EU has also seen what&#x27;s happened to Iraq and Afghanistan, and knows that the east of Ukraine has strong Russian ties. It doesn&#x27;t want to find itself in embroiled in a decades-long guerrilla war, which is what would happen if it used force.<p>Putin knows this, but he also knows that his country&#x27;s economy is dependent on the EU.

A lot of devices use the Zigbee Home Automation specification which has a different well known master key (in that case it&#x27;s in the standard which is freely available).<p>The ZLL key is slightly more interesting because you can factory reset (and effectively steal) devices in someone else&#x27;s network, but that does require physical proximity to the device.<p>The master key also means that you can make your own device to add to someone&#x27;s network.  Most ZLL networks have a simple push button adding process, so you just need to be close to the button for a few seconds in order to add your own device to the network, after which you can control any other devices already in the network.",1427105397

Specifically, in the case of tech, to me, it really depends upon the level of coding exposure a candidate has. If he/she is a fresher then I would prefer some real-time exercise (white-board/phone/skype exercises) - it helps me get the idea of a person&#x27;s thought process. I don&#x27;t look for right answers in that exercise. If the candidate has some code exposure, I prefer to dive deep into his previous work and figure out how he executed the projects. In both the cases I am trying to asses a candidate&#x27;s approach to execute something. I also try to figure out the candidate&#x27;s ability to pickup new things and start executing them quickly. This is measure of a candidate&#x27;s potential. I assign similar weightage to &#x27;Potential&#x27; as to &#x27;Past Work History&#x27;.",1427104984

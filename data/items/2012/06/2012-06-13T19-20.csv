A IDE user who only knows how to modify projects by adding files and clicking checkboxes for optimization settings will do that for the rest of their career<p>> Using an IDE does not mean that you cannot do advanced configuration, including setting options that change the commandline of the compiler used. Don't almost all GUIs call commandline compilers on the backend?<p>That's really illustrating his point, rather than countering it. If all you think of in terms of ""advanced configuration"" is ""setting options that change the command line of the compiler"", you're missing entire worlds of flexibility and productivity wins because of this GUI-centric view of things.<p>What about, say (and this is a very trivial illustration of flexibility), compiling part of the project, running a tool that analyzes those .o files along with some network resources, which generates yet more source files, which are then picked up by another step in the same build process and linked into the final executable?<p>I had to build essentially that kind of build system a few years back, for two different ecosystems, so that they could share some common infrastructure in a Big Org (a command-line/unix/ant-based Java build system, and a Windows/Visual Studio 2003/2008 based C# build system). The Java version was straightforward, but the Visual Studio version was an exercise in frustration.<p>The IDE Gods grant you no ""custom build step that will generate an unknown number of files with unknown names which you will then pick up and compile as part of this compilation process"" button to press. They give you a build scripting language, MSBuild, but it's so crippled by the baked-in assumptions of its IDE-bound design that it won't get you anywhere (to be specific, it assumes that you can hardcode the name and path of every file to be compiled by the project. It will let you insert a wildcard, but it expands them <i>when the IDE opens the project file</i>, which is useless when files are generated during the build, and if anyone deletes a file from the project in the IDE, it will ""helpfully"" rewrite the wildcard into separate entries for everything the wildcard matched back when the IDE opened the project file. Pure crap).<p>And this is a <i>really trivial</i> way to use the flexibility that the unix build environment gives you. There's so much more that can be automated than any IDE could hope to present a GUI for.",1339617167

As long as the work is sufficiently substantive then copyright will protect it as a whole.<p>The linked document refers to things like the title of a book wherein you wish to use the title separately to refer to the work. An author can't claim that you infringed their copyright simply because you referred to their work. This is not the situation at hand. HN is not merely using the title it is altering it and presenting it as the substantial part of the complete work that it indeed is. If you think about it you'll see how untenable your limited interpretation is, under your interpretation I can take a Harry Potter work and retitle it and add my name as author because all I've altered is the title and name ... to recap it is a particular use of the title that your link refers to and not to modifying without license.<p>Now, arguably in the listings of stories HN could write a new title but on the page when presenting the submitted work they would still lack license to present the work modified (ie with their title).<p>HN should either reject the work as a submission, retract the work or seek a license to modify it. The simplest thing would be to just add some boilerplate that says ""by submitting content we reserve the right to alter it for editorial purposes"". Though it would be nice to allow the user to choose to retract the story or allow it as edited.<p>There may well be a fair use argument for content created in the USA. I doubt there is for content created by European users.<p>FWIW altering a title could also cause defamation or be an act of libel but such situations are relatively unlikely. Modification of a substantial part of a copyright work without a license is infringing already. IANA(IP)L but arguing that a HN submission is a work for copyright purposes seems pretty straight forward.<p>--<p> that's not machine generated or particular short so as to lack discreteness or substance enough to qualify for being a work.<p> I've not seen enough case law on internet content to determine how location of created content is judged; is content created via your form considered to be created where I am, where your company resides, where your servers are or what.",1339616914

That doesn't follow logically <i>at all</i>.

It's sociology 101, nobody wants to be a tyrant, or in bed with them. We want the power, just not the shame, and how mediocre and small it makes us seem in the right light. So we tell stories, and sometimes those stories happen to be true, but that's just because we got lucky, not because we actually inform ourselves. It's also very convenient that those affected can not give any feedback, they're banned after all.<p>Also: dunno about trolls (except that assholes or ignorant people are often called that, when in fact ""trolling"" implies deliberate deceit and trying to play mind games, instead of just being stupid or a jerk; but who needs to think when you can have labels), but why would a spammer not simply use a new account for each post?

We get to the understanding that algebra requires very quickly. You seem to see that as a loss, but I see that as a really big win.""</i><p>This. One of the things my eldest daughter struggled with early on in Algebra was the variables. She kept insisting on having a 'value' for the variable up front because the abstraction bothered her.

One she got rid of the notion that math was 'numbers' rather it was a sequence of mutation rules against things which were infinitely mutable (within constraints), it went much better for her.<p>This program elegantly sidesteps that issue by starting of with boxes.

I've bought 2 flash drives and had 4 failures already.<p>I've seen both drive controllers get themselves wedged to the point where they just shut down and go dead.   This happens because they aren't doing a straight 1-1 mapping and  along with wear leveling (which is necessary) they're trying to compress (sandforce) and optimize (intel) the way data is stored but their algorithms are too complex to be fully debugged (as of last year, anyway.)<p>I've gone back to spinning rust as a result.  I'd love to move my servers to flash, but not until they go back to really straightforward controllers (I hear the samsung controllers are very reliable, and this is why Apple chose them for their laptops) and don't do anything more than wear leveling.<p>For performance in servers, I'm going with a lot of RAM.<p>Right now the drive failure rates of SSDs are way too high in my experience, and reading between the lines and user reviews on retailer sites it seems that my experience is not unusual.",1339616222

4107941,comment,4094550,4094550,2,0,merc1985,,,"I also just had an issue with AirBnb.  I live in a NYC cooperative apartment.  We do NOT allow short-term rentals (It's actually a NYS law, minimum of 30 days).  The person renting out their apartment owns it.  I had spoken to AirBnb about this issue, asking them to remove the listing.   They feel that this is an issue between our building and the owner of the individual apartment.     However I asked AirBnb why they allow apartment rentals in a state where the law does not allow it.  AirBnb stated that the lessor signs an agreement and therefore the onus is on them.  However, I feel the law is implicit and AirBnb is aware of this law, then entering a contract with prior knowledge of the contract already being invalid makes AirBnb culpable.  You dont enter contracts knowing the contract is already void.
It's amazing that AirBnb's entire business model pretty much hinges on this contract cop-out.  
It has yet to be seen if my building decides to include AirBnb as a defendant in a lawsuit against this owner as we work to evict them.   
The main reason why toursts need to stay in hotels is also as follows:
1) no background check - allows opportunity of crime.  Example: pedophile renting a house or apartment near children.  Or someone wanting to rob a specific apartment or group of apartments. How do you gain access to the building?  $120 bucks, one night.    
2) Fire Code: hotels have sprinklers and proper signage for fire in places where people are not as familiar with the surroundings.  This puts the guests at risk.
3) Fire hazard: Guests are unfamiliar with the stove, or jet lagged or smoke a cigarette etc.  Risk of fire is greater.
4) Noise: guests decide to have a party or blast music.  Or they are just up late b/c they are on vacation. 
5) Vermin: guests arent going to be as clean.  B/c, hey that's what the cleaning deposit is for. This can attract vermin.   Then there's the chance the guests bring bed bugs with them.<p>And yes, I agree it does take away units that would otherwise have been used for long-term renting, robbing the rental market of stock.   NYC has about a 1% vacancy rate as it is.<p>AirBnb is going to see a huge litigation storm coming its way if it doesnt take more of a proactive approach where local law does not allow such rentals.",1339615797

It doesn't matter that I bought the machine in another country (something that would be a hassle with other manufacturers) and I didn't have to send it off-- I was without my computer for all of the time it took to eat lunch, not a couple weeks.<p>Apple has radically changed the service/support situation for their machines, and thus they are designing machines to be highly serviceable by APPLE, not by users.  These aren't made to be modded, but for apple to be able to quickly service.<p>I think iFixit is looking at these machines in the context of other players in the industry.  You have to service your Dell laptop because getting service from Dell may well be a pain in the butt or simply not possible.   That's not the case with Apple-- provided there's an Apple store reasonably close (and if not ,they have pretty efficient mail in service.)<p>My experiences with PC makers, with consumer electronics makers of all types, and even big companies like Intel have never been anywhere close to this level of service and convenience in the service.<p>[1] Between me and my cofounders we've had this experience with Sony, Dell and HP.  The results we got with Apple astounded one of my cofounders because their experience was that things just didn't work that way-- and in their experience it took <i>several</i> multi-week trips to the repair shop to get their name brand PC repaired, leaving them effectively without a computer for months-- because the maker saved money by outsourcing repair to some random third party repair agency.

I could add an email-sending make step to my project if I happen to want send emails when I checked changes into git. I don't know which one is better and I don't do either right now because I don't have to.<p>As far as doing things ""the same way"" goes, the same way as what? I've actually done lets of command-lining in my time. When I need to formulate a twenty argument command, I usually edit it in a text file and paste it to the prompt. And the thing is, the argument syntax of shell commands isn't consistent. The only unifying factor is the various pipes but it's hardly a panacea. I mean, fricken grep only searches directories recursively for a pure wildcard search (just ""*""). You can pipe the results of this search to a further search for, say. "".cpp"" but if you've got lots of non ""cpp"" files that happen to have the ""cpp"" string next to the string you want in them, you're hosed. I'm sure someone has some other trick for this somewhere.

But here's one for you, in turn: I'm glad that it works for you and that you like it, but if you want to insist it's objectively superior and I don't know what's better for me (which is what you've been doing throughout this thread), I cordially invite you to go fuck yourself. Impolite of me, sure, but telling you to go fuck yourself is considerably less impolite than patronizing people who decide they don't value working in the same way you do. I've been where you say to be, I've done what you say to do, and I got the T-shirt that you're rocking out in. I put it in a drawer because I think it wears poorly.<p>I have <i>plenty</i> of experience with ""make, shell, and ssh""--I'm neither new to nor afraid of working in shells. Doesn't mean I want that to be my primary work environment and <i>certainly</i> doesn't mean I'm either ignorant or wrong for disliking it. <i>For me</i>, a phrase which I will italicize a few more times because you seem unable to internalize this, the UX of the command line abjectly sucks for tasks beyond basic file manipulation and quick text editing. It sucks! <i>For me.</i> I don't care about its hallowed consistency when it makes me feel like shit to be using it all day and makes me feel like I'm wasting my time. Learning new tools is, <i>for me</i>, a smaller cost than hating what I do. I'd rather go learn a new tool, one that's specialized to its use case, because in every case I've encountered it is both a more productive and more enjoyable experience. If I'm not going to value doing my job in an enjoyable fashion, I might as well go be a plumber.<p>I'm more than happy to use the command line to handle deployment tasks and other automation, but for actually creating things, writing code and doing development work? I'd rather have a tooth pulled than work in vim all day. But I recognize that that's the case <i>for me</i>. Your decisions to use those tools are right <i>for you</i> but not <i>for me</i> are your decisions--if they make you happy, awesome! But your patronizing ""what you do is nonsense"" crap (and your consistent implication that not adopting your methods is borne out of ignorance rather than experience) leads me to invite you to GFY.<p>Preferring consistent tools to specific tools for different tasks is not <i>better</i>; it is <i>preference</i>.

The client is then immediately responsive, as the client model of the world is what is rendered, but if the model of the world on the client diverges from the model of the world on the server, the server overrules it.<p>This would ensure the client did not violate position rules, while still keeping it responsive, at the cost of an occasional noticable update when models get too far out of synch.<p>As far as I know many games have done this, since Quakeworld.

Wallhacks were originally possible in Quake because pre-QW, the client received the position of every player on the map.<p>The strongest way to prevent wallhacks is to only tell the client about other players they should be able to see. The id and valve engines do this, for the most part. Again, quakeworld in 1996 severely curtailed wallhacking by only showing the users players that were visible, or ""almost visible"", i.e. near corners.<p>Your example of infinite health packs is something that could be trivially tracked on the server side and is, even for games as big as WoW.

Your opinion does not negate others' and no amount of random people saying ""I like them still"" will address the actual concerns I pointed out.",1339614199

  What problem is no one solving,
  What post is no one reading,
  No one.

  What dream is no one chasing,
  What data is no one erasing,
  What book is no one facing,
  No one.

  Chorus
  You can read the hacker news,
  Comment on anything you choose,
  Spend some time in someone else's shoes,
  Even geeks sing the blues.

  What password is no one cracking,
  What life is no one hacking,
  What startup is no VC backing,
  No one.

  What ego is not inflating,
  To what kickstart is no one donating,
  What Y is no one combinating,
  No one.

  [Chorus]

  Bridge
  When I look at all that hasn't been done,
  A tear comes to my eye,
  Hacking is nine tenths of the fun,
  I know I'm not the only one,
  (whisper) Who asks

  What packet is no one routing,
  What service is no one clouding,
  What source is no one crowding,
  No one.

  What option is no one vesting,
  What code is no one testing,
  What API is no one RESTing,
  No one.

  (spoken, with spirit, vigor, vim, and emacs)
  What login is no one guarding,
  What db is no one sharding,
  What raid is no one striping,
  What drive is no one wiping,
  What product is no one schlepping,
  What ps is no one grepping,
  What language is no one mocking,
  What IO is no one blocking,
  What life is no one living,
  What flying flip is no one giving.

  [Chorus] (with passion)

  Alt Chorus
  (continue the passion)
  And I'll read the hacker news,
  Comment on anything I choose,
  Spend some time walking in your shoes,
  Together we just can't lose.
  (sigh forcibly)

  (crescendo)
  No one,
  No one,
  No one,
  (ritard.) (speak) No.
  (G.P.) This one!

In general, owning a name that can be seen to infringe a trademark is a problem, no matter how you slice it. The Celtics baseball team have an actual, legal claim to the word ""Celtics"", which is not unlimited by any means, but is certainly stronger than ""some guy registered this name on this site"".<p>Now, had he been some sort of Celtic organization (and I mean the ethnic group, not the team) it might be a more interesting discussion, legally.<p>(And I'm just skipping out on the ethical issues.)",1229723746

Consciousness is affected by what other things are, vs only being affected by how other things interact with it.  For example, given the right momentum, area, and angle of impact, one lump of matter has exactly the same effect on my red bouncy ball as any other lump of matter.  The kind of object the lump of matter is makes no difference.  On the other hand, the kind of object has a very definite effect on consciousness, more so than the material make up.

Is it really any more suspicious to happen again 11 months later rather than 12?  It's only a cognitive bias that makes ""one year"" sound like a much longer time than ""11 months"". Also consider that this would be the same season and thus similar weather conditions and fishing seasons, and that the accepted conclusion about January's event was that particularly bad weather conditions at the time caused a large number of ships  in the Mediterranean to drop anchor, the dragging of which is a common cause of cable cuts.<p>That it is multiple backbones and they broke simultaneously sounds suspicious, but these cables are all located quite close together, close enough that it's possible they could be severed by the same event.  No coordination or intent is necessary.<p>That it is the Middle East sounds suspicious, but who is the suspect, and what is the motive?  The fact is that this is more of an inconvenience than real harm to anybody, and doesn't appear to benefit anybody, either.  If it was a US action, why does it primarily inconvenience US allies and economic partners?  If it was a terrorist act, why has nobody taken responsibility for it?",1229723076

Before, we had been in a boom that thought value was limitless for crap.<p>Trying to look at Digg objectively.  They don't make money with their current number of staff people and revenues.  Maybe their readership will increase to a point that they will make money (assuming they don't need more staff as readership increases).  Maybe they'll be able to cut staff and slow down ""product growth"".  Of course, that risks a competitor out-doing them.<p>Likewise, Facebook hasn't found a way to be popular.  Their userbase keeps increasing, but they're at a level where the scaling problems get real bad and require lots of staff.  They're also adding users from places advertisers don't pay as much for (while they cost Facebook more in terms of things like bandwidth).<p>The question really is whether these companies can become profitable and whether they can become profitable to the extent required by their valuations.  For example, assuming a yearly profit of $100,000,000 and an opportunity cost per year of 10% (investing in something else) and a 100 year lifetime, Facebook would be worth less than $1B.  And that's assuming they're able to make $100M per year for 100 years.<p>Even if you say they're going to make a billion per year for 100 years from this date, they're still worth less than $10B.  And why should we assume they'll be around in 10 years never mind 100.  Friendster of 2002 is (6 years later) a has been.<p>I'm not saying that Facebook is bad, but 100 years is a lot of staying power.  Heck, what technology firm can claim such a thing.  Venerable IBM will hit 100 in a few years.  But IBM is not the dominant company many people invested in over the years.  They don't even have a PC business anymore.<p>Many technology firms go under because they aren't able to produce efficiently enough to stay afloat.  Unlike Microsoft, Facebook can't just raise prices because their paying customers (advertisers, not users) can go somewhere else unlike Microsoft's lock-in.  They can't charge users because the value they have is based on having so many users and the competition would love if Facebook gave them such an in.<p>Many of these things are cool, but there's a big question as to how much money they can make.  With high valuations, it's not just about making money, but enough money to justify that valuation.  I think investors are looking at that now rather than thinking, well, this is really popular therefore has a lot of value.",1229721989

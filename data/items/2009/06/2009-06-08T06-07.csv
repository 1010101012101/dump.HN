2. Finalise sign up by filling in a details page.<p>The final step is to agree the the TOS and enter the CAPTCHA. I tried numerous times to enter the CAPTCHA (I REALLY wanted to try the service).<p>After the 6th attempt I gave up, but being the good citizen I am I went back to their site, went to the 'Contact Us' page to let them know something was awry... except I couldn't because the CAPTCHA on their contact form is broken too.<p>Now I have no way to sign up or let them know that something is up :(<p>The moral is: Test your CAPTCHA system!<p>update: turns out their forms work in IE.

Technology is already growing at a faster rate than we can effectively regulate it.<p>There will definitely come a point when technology will be able to improve the ones improving technology, whether they're AI or cybernetically enhanced humans. That's going to profoundly affect everything related to technology (which is pretty much everything). Imagine if your neighbor can just think up the plans to make a nuclear bomb by getting a cognitive implant, how would that affect the world?<p>There is a lot of speculation, but kurzweil has been fairly accurate with his predictions so far, so I'm curious to why people don't buy it.",1244443240

646905,comment,646288,646450,0,0,vidarh,,,"Libertarian parties in Europe are largely seen as centre to centre-right, as they tend to focus a lot on ""freedom to property"" alongside other rights, whereas the European left overall see property rights as sometimes limiting rights and so not automatically (or ever, depending on how far to the left you go) desirable.<p>But it's muddy - the UK Liberal Democratic Party, for example, was founded by a merger of the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party (splinter from Labour).<p>Europe does however have self-proclaimed liberal and libertarian spanning the spectrum from centre-left to far right, and a bunch of far left parties that strongly adhere to large parts of libertarian ideologies.<p>In fact, personally during school I was campaigning for a Marxist party and during a school debate I almost reduced a ""far right libertarian"" to tears by agreeing with him at very inopportune (for him) moments. He was horrified at being associated with someone far left, and just plain didn't understand that the majority of our party platforms were aligned - it was almost only on the issue of protection of property rights to means of production that we disagreed, and the fact that I was for a far more drastic reduction of government power.",1244441999

However there is one significant effect of the election of the Pirate Part: <i>Swedish</i> political parties have been given a rude awakening and if the Pirate Party continues to gain they will need to face up to the fact that a lot of people want more relaxed copyright legislation, <i>or</i> the Pirate Party may be swept into the Swedish parliament next.<p>(keep in mind: they were polling around 5%, and many dismissed them, claiming that their key demographic of <30's ""doesn't vote"" - instead they performed <i>better</i> than the polls indicated; that's going to scare a lot of politicians into rethinking their stance)<p>It's also bound to make a lot of people think seriously about trying to get equivalent platforms in place in other EU countries.<p>It's an amazing showing for a ""single issue"" (not really, but almost) party running in only a single, small country.",1244441315

The more tabs you have open with flash elements in them, the more memory they are going to use.

1872374,comment,1867315,1871018,0,0,WhooHoo,,,"I don't think it's the economic representation at all that causes mediocre food; I could also give two shits about the economic class targeted by some dish.  The problem comes when they don't have significant heavily concentrated ethnic neighborhoods to sell to; when 70% of your potential customer base is people who have a problem ordering spice levels over 2/5 in one of the billion mediocre Thai restaurants around, you have to tone everything down.  They don't have to worry as much about selling to these people in the CD or in the Rainier Valley since frankly a lot of people are scared shitless driving down E. Cherry St or past Franklin High on Rainier Ave S.  I'm aware of the Richmond scene; that's the benefit of a city that's 45% Chinese people.  The general Asian concentration isn't even remotely that high anywhere in the Puget Sound (it's less than 20% in every city I checked).<p>Sushi (I assume you mean sushi, since most Japanese restaurants I've been to here treat everything that isn't sushi as a distraction) is absurdly simple food (it was created to be fast food), governed mostly by fish quality.  And guess what the fish is pretty good up here, big surprise.<p>I'm not convinced Belltown partiers actually live there.  I'm about 80% sure it and Pioneer Square fill up with the Seattle version of the Bridge & Tunnel crowd; I guess they'd just be the bridge and bridge crowd but I've also heard them referred to as BARKers once or twice (Burien Auburn Renton Kent).  But yeah it's a place to stay away from on party nights; the concentration of drunk morons makes it crime central.  They've got some nice (not-ethnic) restaurants down there as its only saving grace.<p>I also disagree on the antisocialness of the town; if the only people you know are hackers that's your problem.  For people who come here as a hacker and expect to be embraced for it, they should know that the locals have seen a hundred thousand programmers pass through on the MS/Amazon/Expedia/etc gravy train and it's kinda old hat.  They don't think we're very interesting either; a hacker has to do something else to stand out from the 40,000 other people who are just like him/her.",1288942980

If you're a 6'2, 200 lbs guy, you can consider wider range of martial arts.  if you're a short and skinny guy like me, TaiKwonDo would be murder.  Aikido or JiuJitsu might be a better choice.  I much preferred Aikido with its elegance in movements and philosophy.  I found that Aikido requires you to be very in tune not only yourself but also w/ your opponent in the same way as you get in tune w/ the waves in surfing or the snows in snowboarding or your partner in salsa dancing.

Something like Boxing or BJJ will give you the physical fitness that you can get from most forms of exercise, but they lack the mental and spiritual refinement that comes from practice of a ""true"" martial <i>art</i>.  The emphasis on art there implies that it is a true art form, taking years of discipline and practice to grasp just the basics.  Ninjitsu is deadly efficient in combat, combines spiritual refinement (meditation, mindfulness, discipline), survival techniques (herbalism, meteorology, etc.), combat techniques and strategy into a complete package.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninjutsu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninjutsu</a>",1288942599

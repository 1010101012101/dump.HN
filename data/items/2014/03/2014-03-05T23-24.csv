7350872,comment,7350432,7350432,1,0,euphemize,,,"Agreed with kevinpet, I&#x27;d like to hear from people who built large, public APIs. In my experience of doing this in the wild, it usually goes like so: you develop a set of API calls, a client that talks to that API and release the client. Then your director of product demands a change which requires a modification in the data model. You need api versions to avoid your old clients crashing if they use the new data model. Eventually your data model stabilizes and you don&#x27;t need versions so much, but in my experience, it can take years.",1394063968

If you have someone using version 1 of an api, when you decide to make it version 2, you&#x27;re essentially breaking their app by having the reference change to the new one.<p>The answer even touches on the subject that it should be a permalink, yet they then say that a new version should be the same url as the old one, which means it&#x27;s not a permalink! In my view, this is madness and potentially breaking for people using your api.<p>In my personal opinion, you should set out with versioning in mind from the start, otherwise by making even a slight change to your api, you change what the consumer receives, potentially breaking stuff.",1394063801

7350858,comment,7350312,7350312,1,0,abrenzel,,,"This article is sensationalism dressed up as economic reasoning.  In the opening paragraph, the author fails to make the distinction between <i>profits</i> trending toward zero versus <i>prices</i> trending toward zero in a free market.  This undermines his argument even without the very real and substantial caveats he waves away later in the piece.<p>Second, while the <i>marginal cost</i> to sell one copy of a game is effectively zero in electronic marketplaces, the <i>gross cost</i> of making a game is never zero, not even for indie developers, because if nothing else it costs them their time.  What we should then expect to see is a situation where, assuming a game is successful, a game sells at some non-zero price the market will bear until it earns its costs back, with steep discounts following.  Of course, it is more than possible the game will simply lose money.<p>We should expect this to be true even in a world where games are sold purely in electronic form and those markets are flooded with free content (which is to say, developers willing to sell their games at a loss).  Come to think of it, that&#x27;s pretty much precisely what we observe in the games industry today.  Where&#x27;s the beef?",1394063773

After reading other people&#x27;s feedback here I totally understand their situation given that Stripe isn&#x27;t a household name among consumers like Paypal (I hope it will be at some point but don&#x27;t know how given the lack of consumer products). Why not just add &quot;remember me&quot; as the last step after customer has already inputted their information? This would not create any friction pre-payment and you would have more room to explain the feature. This would of course favor merchants and not Stripe, as you would probably gather less cookies.<p>My 2 cents.<p>PS. If Checkout is an experiment still, I would highlight that on documentation.

7350846,comment,7349122,7350616,2,0,rayiner,,,"Obviously you would expect Yale to raise SAT medians in addition to other criteria as the number of applicants goes up, in order to maintain the class size (which it has done for the relevant time). What&#x27;s interesting is how much the bars are raised relative to each other. Remember, the criteria aren&#x27;t perfectly correlated. If you go from top 4% SAT to top 2%, and top 10% GPA to top 5%, you should expect the number of people passing the filter to shrink by much more than 50%. It could be as much as a 75% reduction if SAT and GPA aren&#x27;t correlated at all.<p>Apparently, the number of applications at Yale have gone up by 2.6x since 1976, and the admissions rate has gone down by 3.5x. So Yale needs to raise its various bars to let through 1/3 or 1/4 as much of the applicant pool, in totol. The fact that it has raised its SAT bar from top 4℅ to top 1% suggests that <i>all</i> the increased stringency in the admission standard comes from the SAT criterion. Indeed, to achieve that increase in SAT median with only a 2.6x increase in apps, Yale probably had to make some criteria <i>less</i> stringent.<p>That&#x27;s the crazy part. Not that SAT went up, but that it seems to have been the primary tool to filter the additional applicants, to the exclusion of other criteria.",1394063625

7350808,comment,7346904,7346904,1,0,Zigurd,,,"Take a look at the device management capabilities in Android. Pick a good MDM system that uses the standard Android APIs if you can make that work for you. If that&#x27;s not sufficient, look at what Samsung has done in extending Andrdoid MDM, but beware of lock-in, and I&#x27;m not a fan of Samsung bloatware.<p>I would avoid hackish MDM. While an app can do things like block the use of blacklisted apps, I would prefer to rely on auditing of devices to detect undesirable apps and then to lock the device. That you can do with normal use of standard APIs. Hackish MDM can claim all kinds of capabilities, but if the standard device management APIs don&#x27;t directly support those features, the risk of undesirable side effects, features that invite complacency but are easy to circumvent, and other problems become much more likely. I have not evaluated AppLock personally, do I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s sound or not.<p>I have pushed the boundaries on these kinds of features myself. For example, developing a device-based packet filter that, while it doesn&#x27;t require rooting the device, and does not rely on undefined behavior, it makes creative use of an API that is designed for a different purpose. So if a vendor makes claims of having capabilities that go way beyond what the Device Administration documentation says is possible, get a good explanation of how they do it.<p>An example of a bad hack is that I have seen a &quot;lockdown&quot; app that &quot;blocks&quot; the app switcher button by creating several instances of an app with a blank name and blank screen image. That&#x27;s just challenging users to break your system (by scrolling the list of recent apps) and sneer at it. A gateway drug to more malevolent cracking.<p>But if you really really need behavior that meets a hard set of specs and Android just can&#x27;t do it using standard MDM APIs, consider rolling your own variant of Cyanogen Mod or other aftermarket Android distribution. That way you know exactly what you are getting, and you can implement your desired features in ways that actually work.",1394062972

Therefore, if you gave it a bunch of very similar observations (like differing by 0.1) for a long time, the covariance would get very narrow.  Once the activity spikes appeared, they would not have much influence on the state estimate because the probability distribution would imply they were extremely unlikely events.  This would look very similar to a low-pass filter.<p>Although the Kalman filter retains some aggregate data about past states in its iterated covariance estimate, it is still primarily a recurrence relation where the future state depends on the immediate present, much like a discretized low-pass filter.

(I also worked on that same area before I joined Facebook)<p>These permissions were actually added several months ago, long before the WhatsApp deal was announced. There&#x27;s no connection.<p>I want to correct some of the misrepresentations in the article.<p>The WRITE_CALENDAR permission: As many app developers will know, this permission is needed by any application that wants to create a calendar feed in the unified Android calendar storage, and create/modify events in it. In particular, the Facebook app would like to give you the option to import your Facebook events so that you can see them side-by-side with your other calendars like Google Calendar, corporate Exchange accounts and so on. We don&#x27;t need to be able to send event invites or updates to attendees by email, but we can&#x27;t divide the pre-set Android permission into any smaller pieces.<p>We use the READ_SMS permission to automatically read SMS codes from people who have turned on 2-factor authentication (called Login Approvals) for their accounts, or for phone confirmation messages when you add a phone number to your Facebook account. Unfortunately, the Android permissions system doesn&#x27;t allow us to specify that we would like to be able to read only SMS messages from a specific number—the one we use to send these codes.<p>In general, we would love to be able to ask only for the permissions we need for the specific features we expect people to use. However, Android doesn&#x27;t allow permission requests on demand; we have to request all permissions that cover each feature at install time, and people must choose to accept or deny all of them at once.<p>If you have specific questions about other permissions that our app requires, don&#x27;t hesitate to ask, and I&#x27;ll do my best to explain how they&#x27;re used.

In standard browser text widgets, Firefox reads your standard OS X key bindings and treats them properly.<p>However, Google is unsatisfied with standard form fields, and so they reimplemented their own glitchy, poor-performance, half-broken text widget, which happens to semi-work in Webkit, but not handle shortcuts like cmd-arrows in Firefox.

I actually see three kinds of secrets people might have:<p>- things they shouldn&#x27;t be doing in the first place (like tax fraud),<p>- things that are dangerous should evil people know about them (by government mass surveilence, you installing a camera in my bathroom, etc.),<p>- things that are inconvenient should morons know about them (like religious/sexual orientation, etc.)<p>Most of the privacy-related discussions here focus on the second and third kind. I argue that we shouldn&#x27;t keep only blaming particular technologies (cameras, satellites, big data), but instead we should focus on dealing with evil people and morons. Fighting technology is pointless (sans starting Third World War) and potentially hurtful (all that surveillance tech we&#x27;re so afraid of can and already does wonders in areas like agriculture, medicine, public safety and social studies).<p>How about we make sure that social and legal structure deters people from acting on collected data in a malicious way, that makes it easier to get rid of morons in your collective social network, instead of blaming mapping technologies for breaking marriages, or Twitter for government shooting their citizens in a more efficient manner, or Facebook for that boss not hiring you because you&#x27;re an atheist?",1394060594

Whoever conducted that research probably found people trusting Firefox than IE or Chrome or Opera. That&#x27;s just my guess. I have heard people saying &quot;web download is broken. You first have to use some browser like Chrome or IE to install Firefox, but what if that IE version is compromised? What if people click on the wrong mozilla.org by googling and instead installed a malicious, modified Mozilla firefox?&quot; Maybe Dell read HNs and thought &quot;yeah let&#x27;s help the poor souls out there!&quot; (<a href=""http://noncombatant.org/2014/03/03/downloading-software-safely-is-nearly-impossible/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://noncombatant.org/2014/03/03/downloading-software-safe...</a>)<p>On the other hand, this charging practice is ridiculous. I can understand some people are not technical at all (espeically the elders and new computer users), but come on, this is a ripe off. If you already created a custom image to load into every hard drive you sell to your customer, modify that image by adding Firefox. How much effort is that, Dell?<p><i>edit</i>:

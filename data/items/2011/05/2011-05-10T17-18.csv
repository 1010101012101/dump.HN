The problem is that this language is archaic, difficult to teach, and is generally taught very poorly.<p>I remember learning calculus in college. The professor went up to the board, scribbled down symbols, and took us through various procedures. I was absolutely, utterly lost until my father (an engineer) told me that ""a derivative is a rate of change.""<p>At that instant, I understood everything. My professor never said this.<p>This taught me to approach math concepts-first, and that helped, but I've always had a problem with math. To make a long story short: I hate math for the same reason that I hate Perl. My mind recoils in horror from messy, crufty languages.<p>At the very least, all math lessons should begin by teaching the <i></i>language<i></i> and the concepts that the various symbols, arrangements, etc. refer to. Only once the language is thoroughly grasped should they proceed to methods, procedures, and problems. Right now it's like teaching Chinese literature before teaching Chinese...",1305050052
2533450,comment,2529803,2529957,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Its a response because they had to respond, they were called out on the playground by Intel.<p>I find it hugely amusing that Intel bought the StrongARM business from DEC (as well as the Alpha team back in the day) and put their 'embedded' guys on it (think 8051/8048) and were surprised that they didn't develop any market share.<p>At the time Intel felt like 'embedded' chips had to be cheap, low power, and peripheral rich. They knew this to be true because they had tried an 8086 SOC chip, it was called the 80186 and it was an utter failure for them. (disclaimer I was the Systems Validation engineer on the 80186 when I worked there in '84).<p>So the company learned that ""nobody"" wanted high end SOCs, what they wanted was a replacable ""core"" CPU, an IO chip which provided a variety of peripherals, and a memory controller chip that could interface to the current memory technology.<p>Their reasoning was quite sound, and literally for decades they have been executing against this 'north bridge' / cpu / 'south bridge' architecture plan. AMD through a curve ball when they integrated the memory controller on the Opteron, it made for faster memory performance and they got some design wins out of it, however Intel knew that memory tech would change and AMD would be up a creek, which they sorta were when FBDIMMs and DDR3 started coming out and their chips only talked DDR2.<p>The scenery changed however with an explosion of embedded systems. Did you know that MIPS was the #1 embedded computer architecture (by volume) for a while because every HP printer had one in it? SyByte (acquired by Broadcom) answered with a nice 64 bit embedded MIPS architecture chip and it fueled a lot of embedded devices with a lot of potential. And of course ARM came out of 'nowhere' (not really of course, its been 35 years of hill climb but it seemed to many that they were suddenly more relevant) and they started getting design wins in cell phones which grew to smart phones and then to tablets. There was a great big 'arm' - ageddon when a ASUS and a couple of other laptop makers were going to ship ARM based laptops and (rumor has it) Intel and Microsoft threatened withdrawing all support if they shipped them. (which would have killed these companies outright)<p>But there really isn't anything those two can do about Apple and Apple's use of ARM in the iPod and iPhone and then iPad really created a volume channel for ARM which, given the resources of more licenses has been evolving the architecture more rapidly, and Intel sold StrongARM to Marvell who has been using it in GuruPlug and elsewhere so it suddenly becomes a 'threat' on Intel's radar when they find the fastest growing segment of electronics that need high margin microprocessors (the place they like to lead) isn't using their architecture.<p>So to anyone who has listened to their marketing spin on how you should use an Atom instead of an ARM, and told Intel ""Except it still takes 4 chips for just the base system and its slower and it takes more power and it doesn't use your 64 bit extensions, ..."" Intel needs to respond, because they know they are losing the next design to ARM, <i>again</i>.<p>And Intel gets lower margin on Atom than it does on Pentium * so it has to be sensitive about making Atom ""too"" good. Rock meet hard place, and there you will find Intel.<p>Which brings us to the current round of chip wars.<p>In ARM's camp their biggest issue is that they don't have a 64 bit ISA specification in production [1] (although I believe the Tegra3 is supposed to be 64 bit) Intel's biggest problem is that they don't have anywhere close to the power headroom that ARM does.<p>The 'next round' (the iPad 3, the Android Tablets, smartphones) seems to be dominated by ARM architectures and Intel wants in apparently. This bit about their 3D architecture is a 'talking point' to explain why things will be different now than they were the last time they tried to get folks to design in an x86 ISA.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.arm.com/products/processors/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arm.com/products/processors/index.php</a>",1305050045

This book has been in print for 70 years or something, and it's somewhere around 400 pages in the current edition I believe.  My professor I did research for had a early 80s edition, and it had almost 100 less pages than the current edition.  There wasn't really anything new added between the versions (chapters are only about 5-10 pages, so there's something like 65 of them)  I ended up using mine for the problems and his for reading because I have ADHD, and the wordiness absolutely kills me.  Symbols and relationships are <i>much</i> more meaningful to me than words describing them.  The real nightmare with the ADHD sets in because of the break in context when you have to switch between two or three pages to find the next theorem, formula or proof.<p>I retook that class twice.<p>On the other hand, I utterly and completely rocked my Advanced Electrodynamics course, outscoring even the graduate students, in a course which even made use of the stuff we were learning in Complex Variables (as well as PDEs and all that fun stuff)  Why?  I had a crazy russian professor who hated all the current textbooks (I'm looking at you, Griffiths) for the same reason that I hated textbooks, too much words and not enough symbols.  So he wrote his own notes to every lesson and made his own homework.  He said he originally wrote those notes when he first came here, and his english was worse, so there's little or no explanation, just proofs -- math and symbols.  A few of these would span two pages, and very rarely three, but there wasn't the context break you get in many college level books, just beautiful math and lots of intermediate steps.  The intermediate steps, almost never provided in most textbook proofs, really help the visual learners like me and provide stepping stones for the inevitable manipulation you will perform with those equations in your homework and on tests.<p>I still have all his notes, I want to bind them up some day when I get a chance.",1305049176

2533322,comment,2532271,2532839,6,0,xyzzyz,,,"1) What do you mean? It depends on field, but in most mathematical papers I read, the ideas are explained with words, not with symbols -- they only serve as helpful shortcuts. Anyway, I believe that properly used symbolism usually clarify the issue at hand, especially when word explanation is very long. For instance, what is faster to read and comprehend:<p><a href=""http://mathbin.net/62276"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathbin.net/62276</a><p>or<p>""Let V1 and V2 be a subspaces of W, such that their intersection is zero. Let f be a mapping from a direct sum of V1 and V2, such that it takes a vector, whose first component is x and second y to a difference of x and y multiplied by two.""<p>And this was easy example, I can think of _a lot_ harder.<p>There is no regulating body of mathematical notation -- it can be (and usually is) created by introducing it in some paper or book by some mathematician who invented it and regards as useful. Frequently, there are more than notation introduced, but usually only one survives -- hopefully the best one. The only possibilities of encountering several different notations in use at once are either reading very old works, which is not good anyway, or the most recent ones, but I presume that people who are able to read them are also able to get over such a minor problem.<p>Seriously, I believe that the mathematic notation is a lot clearer, more intuitive and easier to understand than syntactic rules of many programming languages, for instance C++. Symbol overloading almost never pose a problem, since the intended meaning is usually obvious from the context. If one frequently misunderstands the intended meaning, it is a sign he does not really get the concepts involved, and the fact he is confused by notation is his smallest problem.<p>Even symbol overloading most often takes places only if the sign represents the same idea in all contexts. For instance, one usually uses '+' sign to represent a binary commutative operation whatever structure we all talking about, because, well, it represents similar idea. One can go even further and say that symbols like \oplus and \times in most contexts they are used in (Cartesian product of sets, direct product/sum of rings/groups/modules/vector spaces/mappings) are actually representing <i>exactly</i> the same idea -- namely, the notion of product/coproduct in some category.<p>There are a lot of different symbols in use in math. If we abandoned symbol overloading, we would need to introduce <i>many, many</i> new symbols, and this would create real confusion.",1305048256

2533224,comment,2533209,2533209,1,0,fexl,,,"This is an interpreter for a functional programming language in which <i>everything</i> is a function, including data itself.<p>The grammar (implemented in parse.c) is:<p><pre><code>  exp  => [empty]
  exp  => term exp
  exp  => \ sym exp
  exp  => \ sym = term exp
  exp  => ; exp

  term => sym
  term => ( exp )
</code></pre>
The interpreter is based entirely on combinatorics.  All symbol references are abstracted out, leaving only basic combinators such as S, C, L, R, I, and Y as control structures.<p>As an example, here is the function which appends two lists:<p><pre><code>  \append = (\x\y x y \h\t item h; append t y)
</code></pre>
Note the use of the ';' operator, also known as ""right-pivot"", to avoid parentheses on expressions nested toward the right.  Without the ';', the function would be:<p><pre><code>  \append = (\x\y x y \h\t item h (append t y))
</code></pre>
It doesn't make a lot of difference there, but it comes in very handy with highly sequential functions such as:<p><pre><code>  print ""The value of x is ""; print x; nl;
  print ""The value of y is ""; print y; nl;
  stop
</code></pre>
It currently has built-in functions for manipulating long, double, and string values.",1305047008

It looks to me like someone signed off on eliminating cathodic protection to save money and didn&#x27;t realize the technical implications.<p>Not that that exonerates the manufacturer: cathodic protection is not just a special thing for military ships, even small boats need it if they have metal props (because the props are generally a dissimilar metal from the prop shafts, so without cathodic protection the props just dissolve away over time). So the manufacturer should have waved a red flag about removing it.",1388645924

But as the product evolves, some of those ideas start to make more sense. But we&#x27;ve either forgotten about the idea or the reason we disregarded it in the first place.<p>This has been a bit problematic as it tends to sometimes weed out good ideas that we&#x27;re surrounded by bad ideas.

This is fine for educated women with interesting and fulfilling work options but bad for uneducated women. Furthermore, the lower-class maids and nurses get paid to look after the upper-class children during the day but they still have their own children to look after, too.<p>He sees the need to work as a regression and as a new layer of obligation on the lower classes.

When you arrive at CMU, this will not be true -- not by any factor of your own, but because there will be many folks with a <i>huge</i> diversity of experiences.  There will be people who have done what you have.  There will be people who haven&#x27;t, but have done something else just as cool.  There will be people who haven&#x27;t done either, and will power their way through the curriculum anyway, taking every opportunity to learn new stuff on the side.<p>Be ready for that, because it&#x27;ll be a big hit to take.  (For me, it sure was.)<p>But, the other side of it is this: absence or presence of past experience, in a structured class environment, need not necessarily be a predictor of academic performance.

You have a very strong classical &quot;rounded high school&quot; background, to be sure; but, make sure you understand also that there is much more out there than the classic rounding-out of extra-curriculars!

That should be obvious.<p>The main symptom of domain names&#x27; inherent brokenness is that the law must patch it so that an unknown squatter cannot kidnap some domain, e.g. register &quot;france.com&quot; and ransom it to the people who are most qualified to claim it. This is ridiculous: the squatter should not have had the opportunity to squat this (I know it doesn&#x27;t apply for &quot;France&quot; but it applies for many other names). Nowhere in the world we see kids grab the seat in front of the fireplace and not let their grandma have it.<p>Moreover, what if a single ascii string refers to two different things equally claimable by two groups of people? E.g. what about &quot;francfort.com&quot;? Which city would it refer to? A contrieved case: If Chinese people chose a translitteration scheme for their language so that &quot;google&quot; would mean China, wouldn&#x27;t they have some rights over google.com?<p>This level of brokenness is not even because of a leaky abstraction, this is a sunken boat everyone has to use to cross the river.<p>On a more philosophical stance, domain names are wrong because they build a kind of universal language out of nowhere, grounded on nothing, whitout any kind of democratic digestion and acceptance by human beings. We could have a universal language shared by all humans, but it would be a very long process of slow acceptance, with a percolation through all societies all over the world. In this way, there would be many adjustments, reverts, and eventually we would come up with a set of names that is good enough, but right now domain names are just a musical chairs game that is ridiculous and must be stopped.<p>So I think using a string&#x27;s hash is a nice step, because it starts blurring the domain name.<p>However, I think a much better scheme should be to use the hash of the page <i>content</i> as the domain name. In this case, once the hash is determined, who cares where it is, who care which domain it has? It would just be way to download the content. And the job of search engines would be to point us to these hashes.<p>And dynamic content you tell? Which dynamic content? Does one really care about changes in wiki pages? And for the twitter feed, each tweek is a fixed content snippet, and the javascript fetching them is also fixed, or could be a browser extension. And an up-to-date search engine would have the latest hash for a keyword such as &quot;twitter&quot; or &quot;The Guradian&quot;.<p>A nice side-effect would be that domain name based censorship would become ineffective. And downloading content could be just some p2p checkouts.",1388643355

From day one I felt pressure to achieve some milestones and when these questions came up I inevitably declared unrealistic targets. Worse, after I declared these targets I would feel like crap as began to realize I was nowhere close to meeting them. It got to the point where I would just stop working.<p>At one point, I stopped for 2 full weeks before deciding to face up to the truth: I obviously wasn&#x27;t prepared for what I had decided to do. I was failing.<p>I then realized that even before I quit my job I had been in the habit of biting off way more than I could chew. See, these big corporations I had previously worked for had instilled some really bad habits.  They would intentionally giving an employee more work than one could actually handle, with the idea that they were challenging their employees. No big surprise that every year the performance reviews would tend go the same way. Managers would identify with all the achievements and show understanding on initial goals that were not reasonable to begin with. It makes the employee grateful to manager for the big bonus and also makes the manager out to be a keen observer with great understanding. Certainly fosters a good relationship. The downside in all this is that they establish a really bad pattern/behaviour to have unreasonable goals with reasonable outcomes. I&#x27;m not going to get into the good and bad of the practice suffice to say it didn&#x27;t help me when switching to venture in a start up. In fact it made me feel like shit along the way.<p>So I decided to stop and made a huge list of all the obligations in my life, and I mean everything. From family time to shovelling the snow, mowing the grass, and paying the bills, but more importantly I then prioritized them with a cost ranking. What I discovered shocked me. It turns out the things I perceived as small or insignificant we&#x27;re consuming the large portions of my thinking time. While many of these really did only take a very small amount of time to deal with, they also had a bigger &#x27;nag-effect&#x27; on me. For example: doing taxes. I spent months with background thoughts regarding my changed situation and how optimize the re-situated tax implications. It was always way down on my list in importance and should have been much higher had I understood myself well enough to identify it was costing me more than I realized.<p>I confused by spending the next two months really simplifying my life. I took my list of 100+ ongoing obligations and reduced it to 10. ONLY 10: ongoing.<p>Afterwards, I got back to work and became really productive. These days I make sure I set small goals with really lofty timelines. I&#x27;m pretty sure some people will find faults in this new practice, as there are some obvious ones, but oh well - I&#x27;m now the happiest I&#x27;ve been in 10 years and I don&#x27;t fall into anymore motivational ruts. Week by week I&#x27;m consistently proud of my accomplishments and for the last 5 months or so I&#x27;ve maintained enthusiasm with everything I do.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is helpful, but here it is:<p>Allow some time understanding who you are and how you best operate. It&#x27;s really important to get your head in the right place, before you start and along the way as you observe these problems come up. Be aware of your thinking patterns and don&#x27;t be afraid to make really big changes if that&#x27;s what is required to get you there. Only set timelines that are reasonable to accomplish. Review your timelines/expectations and spend some time trying to call bullshit on them.",1388642561

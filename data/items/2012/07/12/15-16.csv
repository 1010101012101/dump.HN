That too me is compeletely wrong, yet that is how the patent system stands currently.<p>I have also noted that alot of patents that have no working prototype or product, all seem to have been done in some SCI-FI movie/TV series priviously and find it somehow suprising that the movie industry have not started jumping on this patent bandwagon as they have more of a working prototype than many awarded patents that get approved in this day and age.",1342108623

4235175,comment,4234117,4234738,4,0,Smerity,,,"One major disadvantage with so many functions is the cluttered global namespace[1]. PHP only added namespaces in 5.3.0 and can't modularize their globals into namespaces without causing massive backwards compatibility problems. PHP is stuck with a polluted global namespace, I'd be wary of adding more. Mind you, I'm well aware that this feeling could just be as I'm primarily a Python coder -- in PHP, you perform array_keys($xyz) whilst in Python it's xyz.keys(). Whilst you might consider Python as cheating by pushing all the functions onto the objects, it results in a far happier global namespace[2].<p>As far as list comprehensions, I tend to find list comprehensions the readable and self documenting, at least in Python where I most commonly see them. If nothing else, what is the ordering of the arguments for the equivalent non list comprehension? With list comprehensions you don't have that impedance.<p><pre><code>  // Python example with filter vs list comprehension\n  // Filter requires you to remember the ordering --\n  // and does it filter on True or False?\n  filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10)) --> 0 2 4 6 8\n  // The list comprehension is self documenting\n  [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] --> 0 2 4 6 8\n</code></pre>\nI can also convert the majority of list comprehensions into English quite easily -- ""output x for each x in range(10) if x is divisible by 2"" (though it may be cleaner if it was ""for each x in range(10) [output x] if x is divisible by 2"").<p>[1]: <a href=""http://php.net/quickref.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/quickref.php</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html</a> + <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html</a>",1342108368

4235170,comment,4234161,4234679,2,0,viscanti,,,"The reason these types of arguments are generally perceived as being ignored is because they generally argue a point that everyone who has experience with asynchronous programming already realizes.  You need to change your level of abstraction.  That can be through language choice, or through flow control programs, or streams, or switching to a monadic coding style or replacing nesting with a more functional approach.<p>If you prefer that the language does that for you, then that's great.  There's enough viable options out there to fit anyone's preferred asynchronous style.  Node exposes a lot of the low level elements of asynchronous programming (much like the low level programming you could do in C).  You can stick with that, or use a flow control library, or employ any other number of viable strategies to avoid deeply nested callback soup.  You get to pick the level of abstraction you work on, and not everyone wants to work on the highest levels of abstraction (where the language or framework handles everything and you just write synchronous style code).<p>The node community could probably do a better job of directing people to good documentation on those different levels of abstraction (it's a bit silly to assume someone will know to use streams, or monads to clean up the style of their code).  When node first started to gain traction, it felt like almost everyone wrote a flow control library.  Now the problem is solved in almost every way imaginable.  The problem is that new users don't know where to look to find those 3rd party solutions, or how to evaluate the tradeoffs.<p>You're right to find it maddening.  A lot of other people did as well.  It doesn't need to be maddening though, and while you have a valid point, it's not especially relevant given the number of possible solutions (you just have to know how to find the style you're after).",1342108312

But all it takes to get around the technology is apply a few audio/video filters to get around the fingerprinting technology and words and phrases don't work, what if its a celebrity gossip video on Rihanna? That's fair use. The technology Google developed is easily gotten around by those determined and hits enough false positives that people with legitimate content have their videos taken down for no reason.<p>As far as the suffering of the music industry. Music sales are up, not down. There are also plenty of studies that show people who listen to artists online for free have a higher likelihood of purchasing the album online or attending a concert. People are buying more indy artists, not just what they hear on the radio and the middlemen in the record companies no longer control the distribution channels or who is exposed to what artists. Artists are benefiting from this loss of control, so I don't exactly feel bad for Universal, a one of the many record companies that has fought tooth and nail against any progress in consumer friendly methods of distribution and a legit and easy alternative to pirating.

While then I completely disregarded it, now I'm even more so disregarding it.<p>I choose the right tool for the right task. Linger on that over-used saying for a moment.<p>I use Rails when I'm not familiar with the domain enough (this is the business of Software Engineering, we never are as familiar with the domain as the domain experts) and it provides me a platform for radically fast development, in the end I may also have a product that can withhold 2-3 years of evolution, before we need to scale, if even needed (premature optimization..).<p>I also use Rails when the quality levels are set high, and when I need tons of libraries, and I need those fast. In node, the quality level of such libraries are much worse (if you haven't seen it, you're not doing Node enough time - because I haven't seen it at my first half a year on Node). The number of quality libraries / npm modules are probably several magnitudes of order less than that of Ruby gem world. You're going to need to wait 4 years until you get that level of diversity and quality and it sets up in a comparable way.<p>And I use Ruby when I don't care about slow clients, or doing system-level work.<p>At any given time, I keep myself the option to use JRuby, which has comparable to MRI (the ""normal"", C implementation of Ruby) performance and better on a considerable number of criteria. IMHO DynamicInvoke on the JVM will be a game changer in terms of people considering JRuby against, Groovy, or Scala.<p>I use node.js when I know the domain will remain small, non-complex, and I'll be dealing with slow clients (real users).<p>To top all of that, backend systems will NOT turn into thin api servers. Not by any chance. Twitter themselves are rolling back their SPA and bringing back server side template rendering. The number of problem you get into while moving all of your logic and rendering to the client requires a huge blog post which I'll probably make one day. Most people are not aware of that because they never came from full-fledged enterprise level desktop apps -- I used to design CADs and pretty familiar with complex client-side architectures, there are so many dragons there, I'm very happy I now live on the server side, where things are much more predictable.<p>So no, Rails is not dying and neither is Ruby. With the advent of progress on the JVM and JRuby they never will -- this whole discussion reminds me of ""Java is about to die"" when Scala came around and ""Java is about to die"" when Oracle came around. And guess what - it didn't (go read about Java 8).<p>tldr; I use both, and I'd recommend anyone would, too. Server-side will never be just a thin api, Ruby or Rails will not die (at least not by that sword), and the only thing one might want to work on is a good foundation of intuition of when to use which of those.<p>@jondot",1342106129

4234881,comment,4234088,4234088,7,0,bunderbunder,,,"The bit about these kinds of articles that always nags at me is the assumption that different programming paradigms are somehow mutually exclusive.  Essays talk as if object-oriented code cannot also be functional, or code isn't procedural if it involves classes, or whatever.<p>In some cases that might be true - declarative programming and procedural programming, for example, are diametric opposites in many respects.  But others can be quite comfortable bedfellows.  In particular, object-oriented programming and its older cousin modular programming tend to play quite nicely with other paradigms.  Consider CLOS or Objective-C.<p>And even when they're opposed to each other that really just means you're limited in how you can mix them on a per-line basis.  You can still write a multi-paradigm language that lets you support features from different styles.<p>Consider C#, which supports object-oriented, procedural, functional, and declarative programming (with the last admittedly being somewhat constrained), and where it's standard practice to use elements of each style all within a single short procedure.  Sometimes elements of different styles end up depending intimately on each other. For example, to provide optimal support for (declarative) query expressions, one will probably need to implement the (object-oriented) IQueryable interface, and many of the methods in that interface are expected to take (functional) anonymous procedures as arguments and/or are used to build up (functional) monads representing the query that's being declared, which are in turn represented as (object-oriented) instances of classes that implement specific interfaces.",1342105936

To simplify, you can think variables start with $, expressions without variables don't. These two classes are handled in completely different ways. Since array literals are expressions without variables, it isn't too strange that $x[0] parses, but [0][0] doesn't.<p>One reason it is like that has to do with string interpolation. PHP interpolates $x[0] inside double quotes, but does not (and probably should not) interpolate [0][0].

Print it out 1 character per page and submit that in advance at your local police station, getting a receipt.  You are then within the law.<p>Now question is - compression can be views as encryption.  How does that pan out if you use a non-standard form of compression that does not require a key as the compression formula is the key in itself!",1342105259

One thing I can tell you for sure is that it is extremely difficult to understand the culture and work style unless you have really started working for the employer. There are way too many factors to look at which you can never figure out or know during an interview even if you ask good questions and the interview is very interactive.<p>How can you really know about each team member unless you spend time with them ? How can you really know how your boss likes to work with the team? How can you really know if it takes 2 weeks to get email access (corporate clients mostly) or if you will really be reporting to 3 different levels of management even though you were hired by 1 manager? Is your boss obsessed with punctuality in the morning (I had a boss once who would send emails to entire team if someone did not come in by 8:30 AM sharp).How can you know that you were hired for some specialist work but now asked to dive into things that you may not be interested in but gotta do it anyway.<p>The above examples are just a tip of the iceberg. You never know unless you go through it unfortunately. Do not let this discourage you though. My point is that you might be overthinking all this a bit. Ask questions in interview, go with your gut feeling and worst case, you can always quit. Focus on what value you bring to the table. people will always respect you even if the going gets tough.",1342105257

Total time since word first broke: ~2 days. These things /can/ move quickly, which is why I'm paying attention to it for the startup community.<p>We're engaging with Rep. Issa and Chaffetz's office to express our continued concerns.<p>Contact Troy Stock at Rep. Chaffetz's office $firstname.$lastname@mail.house.gov<p>I don't have a staff contact yet for Rep. Issa's office, but I'll update when I do.<p>I'll note that the startup community fucked up.<p>We had a decent opportunity to knock out Smith in the primary. We failed to engage. We lost $350k, left it on the table, when a PAC approached local organizers, offered the money if we had been able to identify 15,000 potential Lamar Smith opponents in the district. Campaigning 101.<p>We were raising money for ads, and failed to do this basic foundational work, meaning we failed to get the money, which knocked off at least one major incumbent in Texas that day (Silvestre Reyes).<p>As it is, know how much SOPA was worth? Five percentage points, with Lamar going from 83% in '10 to 77% in '12 during the primary.<p>EDIT: Look for an update today from TechDirt, assuming Masnick can confirm on the record our reports that the bill has been held from further action at this time.<p>EDIT2: Also, the IP Attache bill is apparently near-copies of pages 70-78 of SOPA, though I haven't verified this.",1342105236

9402966,comment,9402409,9402799,0,0,xamuel,,,">And these practices are in a way unfair against the rest of us workers!<p>This raises interesting philosophical questions about work in general.  If work is inherently valuable, isn&#x27;t anything that enhances it a good thing (assume lack of side effects for simplicity)?  Is it &quot;unfair&quot; if a doctor/scientist/programmer uses a product to be more productive?  Very few of us are formally competitive athletes, and special rules apply to those of us who are.  I think it&#x27;s unfair that some people can afford secretaries, accountants, editors, private schools, etc., those seem much less fair than ADHD medicine.<p>One of my childhood heroes, the great mathematician Paul Erdos, was a famous amphetamine user, does that mean the wonderful contributions he made to our understanding of the universe are &quot;unfair&quot;?",1429448388
9402965,comment,9402293,9402808,0,0,jrochkind1,,,"It is not common in the US, no.  Most retailers accept VISA and MasterCard, the two largest credit card networks.<p>It is more common _not_ to accept American Express -- because American Express typically charges _higher_ interchange fees than the other networks, traditionally their business model was to charge higher interchange fees and use them to fund higher &#x27;reward&#x27; programs for the card holders.<p>That Costco accepts only one network is unusual. That Costco formerly chose AmEx as their exclusive network is surprising, since AmEx ordinarily charges higher fees than the others, they must have had a special deal before, but they found they could get a better special deal from VISA, apparently.<p>All of these things are interesting in being unusual, rather than typical, in the US market.  And perhaps pointing the way to changes in the market driven by mega-retailers like Costco, at least changes in the market that mega-retainers operate in, with unclear effects on smaller retailers if it sets a precedent.",1429448386

I recall having to &quot;reapply&quot; for my temporary job in the computing center every semester (because, of course, it was &quot;temporary&quot;) - and one of my fellow students, after having done this for a couple years, and having a bit of ego, basically just scrawled on his application form, &quot;Hire me again or I will murder all of you.&quot;  You see, if you <i>knew</i> him, it was actually really, really funny.  We were all a close group, and everyone on the team thought it was hilarious.    The HR organization that unbeknownst to this student, screened all applications, and had no idea who he was, took a decidedly different perspective on his application.<p>The proper response was to alert security, and thankfully his hiring managers - who then de-escalated the situation.<p>The problem with the airline situation - their is no easy &quot;oracle&quot; who can confirm that this person is most decidedly <i>not</i> a threat.",1429446228

Many of the having _one_ radio has this in their home and perhaps not in their most important place: the car.<p>In order to elegantly implement a DAB radio in your car you need to attach a dongle to your window and run cables into a (sometimes) new radio altogether. Whilst this may be a simple procedure for _some_ it&#x27;s for the vast majority a huge burden - both in terms of time and money (often costing around 3000NOK - 380USD).<p>It&#x27;s well and fine that they started the implementation of DAB in Norway in the mid-90s, but it&#x27;s just in recent times that we&#x27;ve seen cars come with DAB reception by default. They should at least wait until 80-90% of all cars have access to DAB before switching over - which could take I&#x27;m guessing up to 10 years.<p>This is like only supporting Chrome on important governmental sites - which would rightly cause an uproar on HN.

We have a serious inventory issue.<p>There are far more buyers than sellers of quality businesses between $50K and $2MM. The result is that prices (multiples at least) are steadily rising and have been for the last three years. Currently, the average (what defines average is another discussion in itself) is around 2.83 annual net for an Ecommerce business and slightly less, ironically, for a SaaS one.<p>I know that significantly more inventory could be created from a middleman being proactive about letting an owner know that there&#x27;s interest.

7961960,comment,7961133,7961133,8,0,darthclue,,,"I am quite honestly at a loss for words here. When this originally made it to HN I found out about it because I was awakened by the sound of my wife sobbing on the couch next to me. I had only been out of the hospital a few days and was sleeping on the couch at that time because I lacked the energy to do much of anything beyond sit there and force food into my mouth. At that time, we saw a huge amount of support from the HN community and I was humbled and honored that so many people stepped forward and demonstrated what I believe is the most important thing in this world. That is, that if we are to survive as a species we must unite and cooperate and, whenever and wherever possible, help those in need.<p>Over the last few months, I&#x27;ve finally found a good balance between food and the medicines I must take to simply survive. I am still paying ongoing medical costs which insurance is paying a large chunk of, however, insurance doesn&#x27;t pay for everything. Just some rough numbers based on costs submitted to insurance shows that a single day in the hospital is roughly $3,000/day and a single gamma knife treatment is roughly $100,000. The gamma knife treatment is the best available option for treating tumors in my brain, however, getting that approved by insurance isn&#x27;t easy. The last time it happened, the neurosurgeon had to submit a written statement indicating that my life expectancy was at least 6 months beyond the time of treatment or they wouldn&#x27;t pay.<p>The money from the fundraiser is being used in one of 3 ways: Medical expenses, Putting food on the table, or final expenses which include funeral costs and paying off the house and car debt so that my family will have a roof over their heads when my time comes. For those that have given, I will never be able to say thank you enough nor will I ever be able to repay you. I do hope that your generosity will be repaid to you ten-fold in some way. I&#x27;ve seen many of you give small amounts and many of you give large amounts, however, the common theme is that you are giving what you can while also wishing you could give me. From me to you, whatever you give is precious. Even it is only $5 it is precious because you have taken the time to give and demonstrated that you believe in providing hope and compassion to others and because those $5 donations add up quickly when it is thousands of people giving.<p>I lost my grandmother this month from cardiac arrest. Because of my health, I couldn&#x27;t attend her funeral. That was and continues to be a very painful thing for me. She was always there to make sure I was taken care of and even spent several weeks with us helping to keep me fed and motivated despite her own health failing her. She passed at 80 years, 8 months, and 8 days of age and the legacy she left me was to help others as much as you can. Even though my own health is failing, I am doing whatever I can to bring attention to others whose situations are just as bad, if not worse, as mine.<p>At this point, even though my prognosis has not changed, I am feeling better. I still have trouble moving around as I run out of energy quickly and fight pain constantly. There is still no cure for the type of cancer I have and the treatments I am on will likely cease to be effective at some point. While there is likely to be a point at which all treatment options have been exhausted, I continue to have hope that a cure may be found before that happens. Quite honestly, even if it meant that I was physically unable to do anything and even if it meant that I had lost a substantial amount of my cognitive function, if I was alive I would be fine. That is truthfully the only thing that I have ever wanted. I simply want to live, to watch my children grow, and to die of old age with my soul mate by my side.<p>I want to bring your attention to some other individuals whose situations are, I think, worse than mine.<p>First, there is Nathalie. She is a 15 year old who is battling a rare form of cancer. She is trying to get access to a drug which could very well save her life and might even save mine one day. She meets all of the requirements except for her age. Because she isn&#x27;t 18, she can&#x27;t get the drug until it&#x27;s been approved by the FDA. You can learn more about her situation at <a href=""http://www.4nathalie.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.4nathalie.com/</a><p>Second, there is Ben. He is a father of 4 who was diagnosed with cancer of the Brain and central nervous system in December and given weeks to live. He&#x27;s fought an impossible battle and managed to exceed doctors expectations. At this point, he has exhausted all available treatment options and may soon meet his end. I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the needs of his family are at this time, however, he does have a fundraiser at <a href=""http://www.gofundme.com/ben-fights-brain-cancer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gofundme.com/ben-fights-brain-cancer</a><p>If you feel the need to give but are unable to give to more than one of us, I would ask that you give to either Nathalie or Ben. Although my family does need the help, I want to leave this world better than I found it and that starts by helping others. If my time comes, I would rather that my legacy be that of someone who helped others rather than that of someone who begged for help as others in need were left standing alone.<p>Thank you again for all that you have done for me and my family. I know that I will never be able to repay your kindness.<p>Jonathan Dale",1404067093

7961957,comment,7961118,7961895,1,0,kentonv,,,"Setting up Linux namespaces using the raw syscalls is actually not very hard. Sandstorm does this in a few dozen lines of code. Adding Docker as a dependency would add a whole lot of complication without actually buying us much.<p>There is a big difference is use case here: Docker aims to be configurable enough that you can take arbitrary off-the-shelf Linux apps -- or even entire distros -- and make them run in a container. Sandstorm, on the other hand, requires apps to be ported to a very specific environment. The porting isn&#x27;t usually very hard, but it means Sandstorm doesn&#x27;t need so much configurability and can make stronger assumptions about how an app behaves which lets us do more interesting things with it. For example, Sandstorm can implement unified login and sharing across all apps, it can enforce security between apps, it can transparently update an app without potentially disrupting its storage, and it can selectively give apps access to each other&#x27;s semantic APIs rather than just low-level ports.<p>All that said, using Docker as a tool to assist in building app packages may make sense; we actually build some of our apps this way.

Rates could be something like few cents/km for &quot;civilian&quot; drivers(standard car-sharing - could be problematic depending on the legislature/generated profit for the driver), few bucks/km for cabs, pub transport based on routes/times and - dynamic pub transport routes per km as well. Lets say there is a after-work beer with colleagues planned so you can&#x27;t drive to work by your self. During breakfast you just choose a destination(predefined for freq. places), desired time and a &quot;hitchhiker sign&quot;. All drivers doing the same/similar route(with criteria compatible with yours) would be notified .. a few &quot;accept&quot; clicks away/maybe a quick look at the drivers profile(badges/km driven/reviews etc) and your off to work. No drivers available?

Double-validation for payments based on transport type - no more waiting on a bus stop for 2 hours watching 100&#x27;s of driver-only empty cars going your direction + a public API would mean that bus companies could also use small 6-8 passenger buses and dynamically create new/amend existing routes based on the demand(200 people heading to a business park across town(C) from destination A, 100 from B to D(which is near C) between 0800 - 0900 > change route via B .. if time intervals are met(like 1h from A - C) ) ++ all the data flowing your direction could also be used as a waze alternative for even better routing +++ you could profit by selling api data/on % from commercial transport partners) + have awards for car-share folks like free oil/filter changes after 10k km/free coffee after 20km between 2200 - 0600 etc..).

There are legitimate reasons why having www (or any subdomain) is important in any large site.<p>The CNAME argument is obsolete since most DNS providers support ALIAS records now.<p>The static no-cookie argument doesn&#x27;t really matter since you could always serve static content on a separate domain altogether (ex: fbcdn.net).<p>However, if you want to run hosted services on subdomains, you run into an important security issue. For example, say you have Zendesk hosted on support.mysite.com. You don&#x27;t want to leak session cookies from mysite.com to support.mysite.com. In most browsers, you can just specify the cookie domain and it will only be sent to the root domain. However, NO versions of IE respect this (even IE 10+) [1]. So your IE users will always leak session cookies to hosted services on subdomains. In any reasonably secure site, this is unacceptable (especially when you start using other hosted services for status.mysite.com, careers.mysite.com, etc etc).<p>Unfortunately, this is pretty much impossible to work around, unless you want to ban IE users from using your site entirely.<p>Solution: Just use www (or any other subdomain, if you want to be different) from the start, and save yourself the headache of migrating later.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2009/08/20/wininet-ie-cookie-internals-faq.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2009/08/20/winin...</a>",1404065174

Kudos for having the courage to tackle these problems and the dedication to wipe out your own savings in the process.<p>However, people who are as dedicated as you still need to protect themselves. In this case, it sounds like you&#x27;re experiencing some financial stress as a result of your endeavours. Not only does stress like this interfere with your personal life, but it will also make your activism less effective. We need people like you to be able to run marathons and not just 100m sprints!<p>My advice is to network as much as you can and find a group of likeminded people with complimentary skills. Because you&#x27;re the kind of person who believes giving back is important, you&#x27;re also the kind of person who can motivate others to do the same. If you can find a likeminded group of people, not only will you get access to more skills, but you&#x27;ll get access to more equipment. I also suggest that you blog about your projects, tell stories about people you have helped, and ultimately treat your social endeavours like a business. Buzz will attract volunteers at first and eventually donors.<p>In the meantime, ruining your finances will harm the very people you want to help because if you experience financial ruin, you&#x27;ll have less time and inclination to help. Therefore, focus on the types of projects you can implement in your own community, using equipment and skills you already have. It&#x27;s good to dream big, but with social entrepreneurship it is more important to dream sustainably.<p>Edit - I won an award for some social entrepreneurship that I was involved in.

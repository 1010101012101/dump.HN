For example philosophy or art.<p>While the test might have no logical basis, it does form a base line, in the same way that the a unit of measurement (the kilogram for example) may have no other logical basis, it is something which can can be agreed on and thus compared against.",1351292376

It's a reasonable to assume that these 3 questions were considered important in the general assessment.<p>> You have to do better than the majority of candidates (maybe ~80% of candidates).<p>I know, I said I read your book. ;-)<p>But that doesn't substantially change the story, it means it's likely other candidates got the optimal solution or got closer to it.<p>Of course this is all based on my self-assessment, since Google doesn't provide any sort of feedback post-interview. But I'm pretty confident that I went well in the other questions. 4 out of 5 interviewers were pretty nice in giving feedback during the interview, even if indirectly. E.g. they'd ask progressively more involved questions on the same topic, so I more or less knew when I had answered the previous questions correctly.<p>> Additionally, you seem to assume that since (according to you) getting the optimal answer is necessary, that it must also be a sufficient condition. That's obviously false.<p>No, I haven't made any such assumption.

Really? They've targeted the embarrassingly parallel problems with their GPU's, rather than even try to address the multitude of problems that their GPU's simply will run mostly idle on, leaving that to CPU's with massive, power hungry cores and low core count. I see no evidence they've tried to address the type of problems this architecture is trying to accelerate.<p>Myabe the type of problem this architecture is trying to accelerate will turn out to be better served by traditional CPU's after all, but we <i>know</i> that problems that don't execute the same operations on a wide data path very often are not well served by <i>GPUs</i>.",1351291651

The reason I'm confident that this bug is not due to filesystem errors on my machine's part is because Dropbox's version history for these files has become corrupted. If you read over the details and correspondence, you'll see that Dropbox engineers were able to recover two of my files that Dropbox's version history had reported as <i>only</i> having a 0-byte version. These files were edited recently, within the 30-day window that all Dropbox users, Packrat or not, have version control for.<p>The files had clearly been whole when first synced to Dropbox, but that version was not listed in Dropbox's history, and so I had no power to restore them.

But, it seems that consumers <i>will</i> abuse it: given a choice between a $30 BluRay of ""The Avengers"" and torrenting it for $0, lots choose the later (not the least of which is to avoid the pain of ripping the movie later).<p>I wonder, though, how bad the abuse would be if the service was really easy to use, and priced correctly?

To be clear: that's Python you're reading. It's pretending to interact with the DOM. These calls get bundled up and sent back with the response for the frontend code to slavishly execute. The result is quite a schizophrenic API.

4704573,comment,4704039,4704428,2,0,jules,,,"In n-space the problem is almost as easy as in 2-space if you can only go in forward in each dimension. If you can go in both directions and you want to find the number of non self intersecting paths, the problem is hard even in 2-space (as far as I can tell). If you allow paths to be self-intersecting, then the count is obviously infinite. Note that the actual interview question asks you to list all paths, not count them.<p>To count paths in 2-space from (0,0) to (5,6), you have the operations ""X++"" and ""Y++"" which go right and up, respectively. Each increasing path from (0,0) to (5,6) has to be some permutation of 5 times X++ and 6 times Y++. So the count is (5+6)!/(5!6!) where the exclamation mark denotes factorial. This extends to higher dimensions by adding an additional operation ""Z++"". Then the count to go from (0,0,0) to (5,6,7) is (5+6+7)!/(5!6!7!).",1351290771

When using big-O notation, always make sure you agree on the base N values you want to work with.  In this case, it sounds like you interpreted N as the number of bits to hash, in which case yes, any sensible hash algorithm has to look at all the bits so it'll use an O(N) algorithm.  However, the post you replied to talked about hash tables, a structure used to implement (among other things) maps from keys to values.  For such a structure, N refers to the number of items stored in the table; hash tables have the rather unique property of supporting O(1) insertion, removal, and lookups (modulo amortization arguments about the size of the table).",1351289629

I imagine that half of the question is making sure that the interviewee presses for details, because there's plenty of problems I see with the question right off the bat. If n is even, there's no single center node, so where does the algorithm start? Can the algorithm traverse diagonally by edges, or only by adjacent faces? Not to mention that there's an infinite number of possible paths for some values of n, assuming paths can cross themselves, for the same reason that there's an infinite number of paths from my front door to my car if I feel like walking in circles for a while.",1351288888

Rational thinking, however, can be applied to areas where you have no or little experience.<p>Say, if a person doesn't know programming, his 'intuition' in programming would just be wild guesses and unlikely to be useful. However, he can still gather facts on programming and think rationally on it, no matter how slow and painful.<p>So in your original context of your post, I would suggest that we should only use intuition when we have extensive experience in that market or working with the target users. Otherwise, stay close with rationality.",1289059111

I don't think in terms on one versus the other, if you are not using both, something is wrong. Easy to understand if you don't have any intuition, but if you do and you ignore it for the sake of 'rationality', I'm not sure that would in fact be rational! We get our ideas from a lot of different places, some more off the wall than others--- once we have them we can examine them and proceed or discard based on some presumably rational evaluation.

It's a transparent loser's speech that, thankfully, we've yet to actually hear Apple incant.<p>Apple is trying quite hard to get the biggest market share: Did you happen to catch Steve bragging about leaving RIM in their rearview? How desperately he compares iPhone activations to Android activations?<p>Have you noticed the incredible quantities of lucre that Apple is dumping on mass media advertising lately? (I don't have the numbers, but it is, by far, the #1 advertised brand from my perspective). Have you noticed that Apple is now making products at virtually every price point?<p>Apple is the very definition of a mass market company. They are not a niche or a luxury maker, and delusions to that effect are simply bizarre.<p>Sure, they don't sell a discount iPhone, but that's entirely because consumers are accustomed to subsidized models, so going from $600 to $500 really makes no difference (it really doesn't matter whether the phone is $200, $150, $99, $49, or even <i>FREE</i> when each comes bound with a $3500 smartphone contract).<p>If people were accustomed to buying devices without subsidization, Apple would have the entire low-end market covered. On the Android front by far the most popular phones are the high end phones like the Galaxy S and the Droid 2, which are hardly inexpensive devices.<p>Apple came incredibly close to achieving a brilliant strategic lock-in to the nascent smartphone market that would have locked them in as the default choice: Many organizations had a mobile strategy that simply relied upon ""releasing an iPhone app"", creating a network effect where you were either onboard with the iPhone, or you're a second class citizen. Here on HN there were quite a few single-person startups that had a business plan involving nothing more than creating an iPhone app, yielding a strong anti-Android bias -- having multiple platforms is just a PITA, right?<p><i>Remember, this is not a race to be the company who sells the most units, it's just about making tons of money, and this is what Apple cares about.</i><p>I edited that slightly to what I suspect you meant to say. It's another ridiculous lie that we keep hearing.<p>Apple had the ""niche market"" for quite a few years. Yeah it led them to desperately go to Microsoft, hat in hand, begging for some ""we'll get the anti-trust police off your backs"" payoffs (which they got, funding the recovered Apple).<p>HTC is a relatively new smartphone company. They've been going gangbusters on the backs of Android. Motorola was in complete mobile collapse so their balance sheet isn't quite so great right now, but without Android they would have been done. On and on. The ""Apple makes more profit"" angle is nice, I guess, if you own Apple shares, but otherwise it's completely meaningless.<p>I don't want Android to dominate. In fact I hope that RIM gets some mojo back (and that QNX plays a part. Anyone who did comp sci in Ontario is generally in love with QNX, because it's a beautiful OS), that Windows Mobile 7 can get an R2 out soon that fixes many of the failings, and of course Apple is and won't be going anywhere, and will continue to provide technology kungfu.<p>We need a vibrant, competitive market where one person -- like Steve Jobs -- isn't making technology decrees for an entire industry (see: Flash).",1289056862

1877037,comment,1873542,1876886,0,0,nileshk,,,"I, too, went the LCD route initially because I thought the burn-in issue was important enough to go that route, but ended up exchanging the LED-LCD I bought for a plasma and was much happier.<p>I have my plasma TV set to automatically shut off after 3 hours of inactivity.  Also, I have the ""pixel orbiter"" feature turned on which periodically slightly shifts the picture around (not noticeable to the human eye when it happens).<p>From what I have heard (in places like avsforums and elsewhere), newer plasma TVs are much harder to permanently burn, especially after the initial break-in period; it is pretty much a thing of the past.  You'd really have to try really hard to make it happen (leave it on a still image for more than several days), and I think an auto-shutoff of 3 hrs will prevent that.  I don't have any scientific data to prove this, though.<p>I haven't been a long-term owner of a plasma TV yet (bought my first HDTV set about a year ago), so I'm not a good data point, but in that year I have not experienced any such problems and we leave things paused or on menus all the time.  I expect that some day my plasma display will show signs of age.  Supposedly, the green phosphors tend to age faster than the blue and red, which will cause a shift in color.  But that could be 10 to 20 years from now.  And LCD is not immune to aging; the 9-year-old LCD monitor I am using right now has had uneven brightness all over the screen in weird blotches for the last several years.  I assume its a backlighting problem; but it doesn't bother me as I've adjusted to it and I continue to use it.  If my plasma ever develops burn-in, I'll probably adjust to it in the same way.<p>The difference between LCD and plasma for me is this: with LCD I find myself noticing all the artifacts -- the colors being unrealistic, the motion blurs, the flashlight effect (backlighting being noticeable on dark scenes), etc.  Processing like judder correction and blur correction just makes things worse because it makes film look like it was shot with a video camera.  LED-LCD TVs are especially bad (I owned an edge-lit one for a few weeks before returning it), because the colors are even more unrealistic than with CCFL-backlit, though maybe the newer tri-color ones are better.<p>Whereas, with a good plasma TV I can just watch the content because there are no artifacts and deficiencies that I can see.  The colors are closer to what you can expect from a CRT.  Also, plasma displays seem to smooth out pixelation; I can watch video that is very low resolution and it looks great fullscreen on the plasma while it doesn't look good fullscreen either on my LCD or CRT computer monitors.  I guess you can say that plasma is slightly less sharp, but this works out in its favor.<p>One of the big differences is: with plasma each pixel is actually producing its own light, whereas with LCD you have backlights shining through the pixels which is why LCDs are not even.  Also, plasma looks the same from all angles, whereas with LCD you generally have to be center (vertically and horizontally) for the best picture, though some LCD TVs pull this off better than others.  Side note: OLED displays also have each pixel producing its own light.<p>Maybe I am really picky (I didn't realize how picky I was until I started shopping for HDTVs last year) and the typically consumer wouldn't be as concerned and only videophiles care enough about the difference.  But I think coupled with the fact that plasma TVs are generally cheaper than LCD TVs for equivalent quality and sizes, and the fact that I think with the more expensive LCD TVs you are paying for tech that is compensating for the inherent defficiencies with the technology (e.g. local dimming to make up for the lower static contrast ratio), I think plasma is the better buy for even the typical consumer.<p>I think the slight risks of possible plasma burn-in in the distant future are way too small to choose what I think is the less suitable technology for TV/film viewing.",1289056811

Over the last few years lots of employers have switched to hiring people on short-term contracts and getting rid of them before they become entitled to redundancy pay.<p>About two years ago the benefits system was struggling to cope with this. A person would be claiming JSA, get a job and stop claiming, then get let go after a few months and replaced with another cheap unemployed person. They would then have to make a new JSA claim. I think the result was an increased load in new benefits claims and delays in processing them.<p>This way of conducting business is pretty bad imo - it just screws poor people.

Plus, want to install a game?  A couple taps and a couple dollars, and you're ready to play a game within seconds.<p>Compare that with a PC: find a game online, create an account to download it, spend $20-$50 on it or perhaps just $10-$15 if it's a basic game, wait while it downloads, then step through the installer and if all goes well, you can play your game.<p>We're all programed to do it, and it's a no brainer for those of us that are used to it, but the iOS model is so much simpler for people who don't enjoy tweaking a machine and just want it to work.",1289056074

People only come when they can find reviews, and you only get reviews when people come. Yelp got started having yelp elite parties- they rewarded the top reviewers with access to hot parties with models. It worked. I think anyone that can figure out a way to incentivize people to come and leave reviews has a good shot at unseating yelp. Good luck and let me know how it goes. I'm in Tokyo but live in palo alto- get more content up on the site, or make it dead simple for me to add reviews.",1289056017

(In my experience, decisions and actions based on intuition usually end up having a rational explanation, I just don't fully understand until later.)<p>I also think that you can train your intuition, or at least train yourself to recognize when your intuition is good, and then follow it.<p>Since most people here are trying to think of something new and useful, I imagine that they understand the importance of creativity and imagination, and since intuition and inspiration are crucial for that, I would guess that most people here basically agree with me, but I was wondering what other hackers have to say about this.<p>What do you think?

Most scientists don't, either.<p>That's not meant as a slam against all those <i>other</i> scientists who just aren't as smart as brilliant ol' me.  Interest in epistemology is different than a passion for protein folding, and one can effectively apply the methods without diving deep into the philosophy.<p>In the New Organon , (wherein Francis Bacon basically invented the scientific method IMHO), Bacon outright says there will be millions of ground soldiers applying science to the world without understanding deeply the epistemology of their actions.  He saw that as natural and unavoidable considering how foreign, unnatural, and downright unpleasant the scientific worldview is to a normal human being. Experience seems to bear out his prediction - in fact, all we have is gradations in the ability to apply scientific thinking.  Nobody does it all the time.",1289055959

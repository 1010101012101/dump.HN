That and its on disk size was mostly the motivation. The grsecurity stuff was less a focus to be honest. Stability wise as long as it doesn&#x27;t oops too often i&#x27;m happy.<p>A counter to the wait a week or two idea: I remember the update that changed the md device numbers from 0->128 etc.. I hit that accidentally before it was on the site, then the next week didn&#x27;t look at the site and it got changed back. Piddly stuff like this that you only find when you reboot starts to grate on me is all.<p>I&#x27;m not anti arch by any means, more just not wanting to constantly update with a rolling distro. I found a blog post about nix on the c720 and so I guess I will go buy one some upcoming week. My needs are pretty minimal though, browser+emacs+commandlineish stuff. The rest I can do on my macbook pro which is feeling to me to be more a desktop of late.",1421528273

8905475,comment,8904266,8904266,0,0,danbruc,,,"Mining is what will ultimately make Bitcoin fail. You want to give everyone a single vote so that the majority can agree on which transactions are valid and which are not. But because you don&#x27;t want a central authority that checks ID documents you come up with the idea of mining - make having a vote in the Bitcoin network an expensive thing by requiring to buy hardware and then spend more money on electricity to keep you hardware alive. It&#x27;s not really fair because if you happen to have a lot of money you can buy a lot of votes.<p>But the really bad thing is that you just made Bitcoin transactions pretty expensive - I got six Dollars per transaction for electricity only about a month ago. Even worse, processing more transaction will or should not lower these costs. If Bitcoin would really take off processing transactions worth billions every day, you really don&#x27;t want to protect them by hardware and electricity costs only worth a few millions because the growing transaction volume will also increase the amount of money someone would be willing to spend to mess with your system. At least up to some limit you really want the total mining costs proportional to the transaction volume.<p>And from there down it goes. Bitcoin transactions are not cheap even if the current low transaction fees suggest it. As the block reward goes down all the costs of running the Bitcoin network will end up as transaction fees. And transaction costs of several dollars are the death of micropayments and Bitcoin adoption in the underdeveloped world, two of the most lauded arguments for Bitcoin. I am not dismissive of the idea of cryptocurrencies but Bitcoin with its proof of work scheme won&#x27;t be the queen of the prom.",1421527978

8905469,comment,8902071,8902071,0,0,gregfjohnson,,,"I am 60 and still cannot believe that people will actually pay you to play with computers and robots all day long!  The robots I play with know how to breathe air, which involves a lot of interesting fluid dynamics in addition to all of the other interesting things that go into building and playing with robots.  (The technical term for these robots is &quot;intensive care unit ventilator&quot;.)  I love and am probably addicted to programming.  RE debugging:  while the rush of relief and victory is satisfying when a problem is found and fixed, I find these days that it is more fun to do technical things differently.  Consider a Venn diagram with two overlapping circles to describe a given technical problem.  Circle A is &quot;have something working happily, but may be overly simplistic.&quot;  Circle B is &quot;covers the real problem domain adequately, but may be buggy.&quot;  The intersection is where you want to be.  The question is, from which direction do you approach the intersection?  I used to start from Circle B and debug to the intersection.  Now, I start from Circle A and stay happy/working, expanding that state until it gets to the intersection.  Especially in pair programming I find this to be the best way to go.  If two pairing partners are &quot;lost in the woods&quot; trying to debug a problem, they can start stepping on each others&#x27; toes and get really unhappy.  On the other hand, if they are collaboratively growing an ever-expanding &quot;working/happy&quot; program, things usually go an awful lot better.  Related topic:  I&#x27;ve come to realize that I am good at &quot;really easy&quot; mathematics, and bad at &quot;really hard&quot; mathematics.  So, in struggling with a math problem or new area, my instinct is to massage and massage until the problem magically transforms from &quot;really hard&quot; to &quot;really easy&quot;.  Just last week I had that huge sweet &quot;AHA&quot; rush.  In lambda calculus, there is a cute trick called Church numerals that allows you to encode the non-negative integers as functions.  The functions to add, multiply, exponentiate, etc. are all easy, but the function to take the predecessor of a Church numeral is really tricky.  I knew the predecessor formula and could mechanically apply it, but did not have any clear insight at all as to how or why it worked.  Finally, <i>KAPOW</i>!  Came up with a beautifully straightforward, satisfying, and intuitive way to derive the predecessor function of Church numerals.",1421527886

We should be cooling down the tensions, making it a more trusted environment, making it a more secure environment, making it a more reliable environment, because that’s the foundation of our economy and our future.<p>[...]<p>The concept there is that there’s not much value to us attacking Chinese systems. We might take a few computers offline. We might take a factory offline. We might steal secrets from a university research programs, and even something high-tech. But how much more does the United States spend on research and development than China does? Defending ourselves from internet-based attacks, internet-originated attacks, is much, much more important than our ability to launch attacks against similar targets in foreign countries [...].<p>[...]<p>When you look at the problem of the U.S. prioritizing offense over defense, imagine you have two bank vaults, the United States bank vault and the Bank of China. But the U.S. bank vault is completely full. It goes all the way up to the sky. And the Chinese bank vault or the Russian bank vault of the African bank vault or whoever the adversary of the day is, theirs is only half full or a quarter full or a tenth full.<p>But the U.S. wants to get into their bank vault. So what they do is they build backdoors into every bank vault in the world. But the problem is their vault, the U.S. bank vault, has the same backdoor. So while we’re sneaking over to China and taking things out of their vault, they’re also sneaking over to the United States and taking things out of our vault. And the problem is, because our vault is full, we have so much more to lose. So in relative terms, we gain much less from breaking into the vaults of others than we do from having others break into our vaults.</i>",1421527763

In the US there was a case that was decided last year that might imply otherwise.   A somewhat &quot;famous artist&quot; (Richard Prince) used a photo by a relatively &quot;unknown photographer&quot; (Patrick Cariou) and &quot;transformed&quot; it by printing it much larger, splotching the subjects eyes with paint, and superimposing a guitar: <a href=""http://newsgrist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c66f153ef01157010d2a5970b-500wi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsgrist.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c66f153ef01157010d2...</a><p>On appeal, it was concluded that this was fair use, there was no copyright infringement, and that Cariou had no claim against Prince or right to collect royalties:<p><a href=""http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/richard-prince-wins-major-victory-in-landmark-copyright-suit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/richa...</a><p>It&#x27;s not the same, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to bet that a court would have decided otherwise if Prince had started with Cariou&#x27;s negative and had done the work in the darkroom rather than on the easel.   Which would imply that it&#x27;s not even necessary for the film to be lost or abandoned, and that mere access could be enough.

alternative to Apple&#x27;s operating system for about two years 
now.  I am no computer wizard.  I consider myself an average 
computer user.  Yes--I know a little bit about the command line, can put up static websites, but I am an average user; not advanced.  I like Apple, but I want a computer that I 
can plug an external device in, and with a little coding; I 
can get it to work.  I have always had a hard time with tweaking Apple&#x27;s operating system.  I know they are suspose to be locked down, but I find I just don&#x27;t use my Apple products, besides the Ipad, for most of my projects.  I end 
up using a 10 year old Toshiba.  I&#x27;m not upset with Apple--just tired of updating operating systems--then some programs and externals stop working.   I don&#x27;t like agreeing to 56? pages of legal stuff-- I don&#x27;t read on Itunes.(Actually, I can&#x27;t 
download from Itunes because I refuse to agree to that 
to the terms & conditions because  it is 56 pages)  Why do I own two 
Apple computers--I acccepted them in barter for services.
So call me stupid, but I have been passively waiting for an 
simple to use operating system not tied to Apple, but uses that beautiful 
hardware.  And no, I don&#x27;t dislike Apple;  I&#x27;m just not the fan I was a few years ago.  Yes--It&#x27;s a grest company.  These 
are just my, probally off base, thoughts.  (Who would thought 
I would actually be concerned about the backlash from a post?

Since currencies move very little, most currency trades are highly leveraged. A 20% move in a day basically wiped out entire fortunes.<p>The other people who are exposed are those who took out swiss franc mortgages from other countries[1]. I&#x27;m amazed this was even allowed, but up until now the franc was stable and the rates low so it made some sense.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21639760-poles-were-slow-get-out-swiss-franc-mortgages-now-they-are-paying-price-currency-risk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21639760-poles-were-slo...</a>",1421524923

8905335,comment,8893738,8896795,0,0,x0054,,,"Yes, but 8 props will be considerably less efficient then one prop in generating that thrust in the first place. For instance:<p>One 300x8 inch prop will generate roughly 1 ton of thrust while spinning at 330RPM and consuming 12kW of energy. So, let&#x27;s say we go with your prediction, and assign a 30% air flow efficiency to the one prop system. So in reality, according to you, it is generating 700 kilos of thrust. 700/4 is 87.5 kilos. So now we need to figure out how big of a prop we need to generate 1/8 of the thrust of the 300 inch prop, or roughly 88kg. I am going to use 60 inch props, because that will allow us to space 8 props in a circle roughly the same size as the original 300 inch prop.<p>Ok, so a 88x8 prop, spinning at 2350 RPM will generate roughly 88 kg of thrust wile consuming 6.7 kW of energy! That&#x27;s 6.7 kW x 8 props, or a total of 54 kW, or almost 4.5 times less energy efficient than the one prop system, and that&#x27;s taking into account your proposed 30% efficiency gain from multi-bladed systems and ducts.<p>I build these things all the time, there is a reason why the industry still uses helicopters with a single prop. It IS more efficient.",1421524866

This certainly has a limit, but I don't think we're there yet, especially since we don't even have theater tickets.<p>The real value in Kayak wasn't that it included the big airlines, it was that it includes Southwest (not included anywhere else), Frontier, Airtran and many long tail airlines and forces the big airlines to compete. I traveled 250k miles in the past two years and often found myself on no-name airline flights that I would have never heard of if it wasn't for Kayak. And it has a super clean UI, isn't spammy and doesn't charge fees.<p>Our value is/will be: clean UI, no TicketStumbler fees (we're free!), no Ads on the main site, simple to use, natural language search and user dashboards & interactive maps (both coming soon).",1226689003

That is, marriage1 will no longer mean just marriage between one man and one woman because there will be plenty of churches that will allow other combinations.  Marriage2 will become the basis of the laws in society, and Marriage1 will become specific to each church.

The app integrates the Mnesia database (with replication) and the Yaws web server (with my own extensions).<p>On any given node there were between 1,000 and 3,000 processes (threads) handling requests and internal jobs. I had supervisor trees for ensuring that everything kept running.

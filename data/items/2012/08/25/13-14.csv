My reasoning behind this is that there are a lot of privacy plugins[1] that people use that interfere with the headers and using referer header is even worse because a lot of websites have redirection vulnerabilities eg if you want to be returned to the page you were at after logging into a website the url would be something like login.php?url=/page/id , a lot of websites do not sanatize this which would render this useless. It is also not an option for some websites that must have a function like this, a prime example of this is Youtube[2] which uses csrf token (hidden fields) in forms to mitigate this issue.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.ghostery.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ghostery.com</a>\n[2] - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http://youtube.com/page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http://youtube.com/page</a>",1345903024

Fortunately he seems like a decent fellow, so it's a non-profit learning exercise of something with a lot of prior art in terms of gameplay, it's not a complete clone, and I doubt it hurts sales of the original (which he links to).<p>I guess you're in agreement with me otherwise?",1345902890

Or did it sell poorly because iOS and Android are monoliths and MS was late to the smartphone game and - dare I say it - didn't put their full weight behind WP7 because maybe they had their eye on a more distant goal and maybe WP7 was just a warm-up for their full product-line revamp?<p>Do you really think Microsoft is so stupid that they would expect WP7 to become an instant runaway success against their competitors, without putting even a fraction of the necessary effort into pushing it? They're realistic about their products. How do you know that Microsoft didn't achieve all of its internal goals that it set for WP7? Visible market success is only one possible goal for a company as large as Microsoft, especially with a small and isolated product like WP7. And Microsoft has clearly been driving towards it Metro-revamp for a while now (Zune HD, WP7, W8). They're a big company after all and I'm sure they do analyse likely long-term trends in technology and make plans for how to navigate the future. WP7 is only one move in a long-term maneuver.",1345902626

4431996,comment,4419030,4420690,1,0,tripzilch,,,"re. your rough guess: 30 wpm is actually kind of slow, according to Wikipedia the ""average computer user"" types at 33 wpm. I'd expect someone who spends most of his time at the computer to do quite a bit better even if they never learned to touch-type. I thought I'd time myself copying the first two paragraphs of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute#Alphanumeric_entry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute#Alphanumeric_e...</a> (1024 characters at the standard 5 per word = 204.8 words) and got 70 wpm! I'm a bit surprised by that myself, TBH, since I don't ""properly"" touch-type either--I'd probably get a significant drop if I had to type more than that though, but as you say programming goes in bursts so that's not much of an issue here.<p>As far as you wondering what use typing speed is to a programmer:<p>1) if you can type faster, it takes less effort to fix cosmetic mistakes and you do so more often. you must have noticed as well when looking over the shoulder of a slow typer they seem to make more errors? or maybe it just <i>seems</i> more tedious because you're waiting on it. you must have also seen that a really skilled typist can make an error and have it corrected before you hardly notice it (which is because they feel their fingers slipped).<p>2) in a similar sense, if you type faster, it takes less effort to quickly try something out. just type it out, maybe not even immediately test it, because as you see it on the screen you can more easily reason about it and make corrections before you do. if you type slower, you're more likely to get stuck halfway writing a block of code because you're thinking ""wait this isn't right"" and start doing proto premature optimization (well, that's my problem, I start thinking about what is the best/most concise/pythonic/readable way to write this code halfway, before I even got the rough structure down. I find it's <i>almost always</i> better to first write down something that works).<p>3) if you type faster you spend less time writing comments on HN and can get back to programming sooner.",1345901600

4431972,comment,4431382,4431624,10,0,FrojoS,,,"> Imagine if someone discovered and invented a principle and device for unlimited cheap source of energy.<p>First of all, this imaginary genius could still choose to not disclose his innovation. Patents are optional. Take for instance the Coca Cola recipe. Its kept as a trade secret [1]. But consumers can still choose to drink Pepsi and co. instead.<p>Second, I doubt a case like this, an truly important innovation that only one person will come up with, has ever occurred or will ever occur. If you look at the history of science and innovation, there is apparently always multiple people or groups working independently on the very same innovation. Famous examples are the first piloted flight [2] or the discovery of calculus [3].<p>For me this is the strongest case against, today's, patent law. We overstate the importance of the supposed single genius that humanity depends on. And yes, I question the the basis for any monopoly.<p>In the Apple vs Samsung case though, it was _also_ about consumer confusion. Samsung did not only use Apples innovation like pinch-to-zoom, which in my opinion should be fine, but tried to fool buyers into thinking that they got an iPhone by copying Apple's look and feel. \nYou could say, that any idiot would see the difference. There is no Apple logo or iPhone label on Samsung products. But, I argue, thats just our geeky perspective. My grand parents or even parents wouldn't be able to tell the difference, unless I write them a note with 'A P P L E' on it.\nI could live happily with this problem, but I can agree that this is a grey area.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_formula"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_formula</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_early_flying_machines#Claims_to_first_piloted_flight_by_date"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_early_flying_machines#C...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus#History</a>",1345900882

4431969,comment,4431630,4431630,3,0,nileshk,,,"I love seeing useful keyboard shortcuts being added.  I've always used various Window key shortcuts whenever I use Windows.  I even use the context menu key.  But I wish the Window key was more like the Cmd key in OS X.  That is, I wish it was a modifier key that can be used in key combinations, and ideally have it be the primary modifier.<p>When you have 3 different modifier keys, this increases the number of key combinations exponentially vs 2.  So take for example a cross platform IDE that is keyboard shortcut friendly, with lots of actions you can assign to keyboard shortcuts, like Eclipse.  In the Windows version you only have shortcuts that can be a combination of Ctrl and Alt plus another key.  With OS X (and Linux), you can have any combination of Ctrl, Alt, and Command plus another key, giving many more possibilities.  I miss the lack of context menu key support in OS X, though.<p>As a UNIX/Emacs user, a side benefit of having Command as the primary modifier key in OS X, used for many of the typical actions, is that typical OS X keyboard shortcuts don't generally get in the way of UNIX/Emacs keyboard shortcuts, which use Ctrl and Alt as modifiers exclusively.  I can use Emacs keyboard shortcuts right alongside OS X keyboard shortcuts in the same application (I'm accustomed to both; for example, I might paste with either Cmd-V or Ctrl-Y, depending on whether my right hand is on the home row or not).  But I don't expect that most Windows users would benefit from that particular aspect.  However, I think having an extra modifier key, available to applications, would benefit a good portion of Windows users.",1345900790

4431959,comment,4431382,4431382,5,0,jaebrown,,,"Your argument is really off base. Like most, it seems that you're biased on this issue. There are clearly a couple of things most people have an issue with in this case and all are no reason to be mad at Apple.<p>1. Design - It has been stated over and over by people that Apple shouldn't be able to patent hardware and software design; which is why these same people believe they lost their trial against Microsoft in the 90s. I believe Apple lost that trial because they waited to late and by that time; which was years in, people had a hard time believing the novelty of a computer UI was something to copy but rather a standard to implement. This is why Apple since Jobs return in 97, has made it their mission to put design first and foremost. They have built the company since 97 on design because it's the one thing, that truly distinguishes a product upon appearance. This is why that went after Samsung early, as they didn't want to give people time to infuse the two.<p>No, Apple did not win the right to have a rectangle. Clearly Palm, Blackberry and a couple other smartphone makers from earlier in the 2000s have been doing this but Apple did win because Samsung blatantly copied the look and feel of their rectangle.<p>2. Innovation - If anything, this verdict will spur innovation in the smartphone space. I personally can't wait to start seeing different UIs and hardware models. After the iPhone in 2007, everything has pretty much looked the same. It has really become boring. I applauded Microsoft for what they did with Windows Phone/Mobile from a UI perspective. It shows the possibilities when you think outside the box and try to innovate and now their Windows OS is going in the same direction. We don't know the possibilities with hardware because no one has taken the risk to introduce some truly different or revolutionary, since 2007.<p>Look what FrogDesign has done with the UI of Android, that no other OEM has even attempted to do. <a href=""http://www.frogdesign.com/work/sharp-aquos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frogdesign.com/work/sharp-aquos.html</a><p>3. Patents - The Patent System is clearly broken and needs change; which is why there is a bill on the Senate floor right now for that. I personally don't agree with software patents but I'm in huge favor of design and utility patents. Those are the patents that don't stifle innovation and force companies to be creative and innovative when building their products. Companies should definitely have to license patents that infringe on these two, as these are the areas where the most and hardest work is done because these are the areas that are most transparent to the consumer.<p>For all the talk and comments, I've seen and read from people, I've not heard of any more pressure to Congress on this issue. I've not heard one politician say ""I'm pushing this issue because my constituents have been urging me to do something about it"". We did something about SOPA and PIPA but have done nothing about patent reform. So, I fail to really hear anyone out on this stance if they're not actively trying to pursue a change. I've not seen one sign up or online petition on HN, Reddit or any of the other internet darling pushing this issue.<p>I think people need to stop taking such an interest in this, as Apple is only doing whats best for them, within the law that we all follow and are not trying to change. We all do whats best for us. An even though we're not companies, I think that's a greater reason for them to do so, as they adhere to shareholders; which are people. So if you have a problem, have it with the Shareholders Dilemma.",1345900234

85901,comment,85589,85589,0,0,vikram,,,"I had similar issues. But I find that the simplest way to get around them is to use VMWare or Parallels, depending on what your emacs is running on. Run Lisp inside the OS of your choice and connect to it using Slime.<p>If you don't use Slime+Emacs+Tramp, I don't think it's worth getting into CL at all. Slime absolutely rocks my world. I have 8 SBCL instances running on multiple machines (virtual and dedicated) on my network and the internet, and I don't have problems doing any lisp development.<p>My advice would be to pick the OS/Lisp implementation based on what you think you might need.

85897,comment,85829,85829,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Don't use the dollar?<p>I'm not sure what he's getting at. Use a payment service and quote in whatever currency the use prefers. It's not like you have to do your own currency exchange or anything -- all that stuff can easily be handled.<p>Also the ""there won't be a Web 3.0. Web 3.0 is a Web 2.0 meme"" seems a little flip. The 2.0/3.0/4.0/etc meme is from software versioning, not Web 2.0. So I imagine whatever comes along big on the web next people will naturally call Web 3.0 -- for the same reason the next big wr will probably be called WWIII. That's just the way numbers work. Of course, ""Web 3.0"" may never catch on, but that's a different story.",1196766888

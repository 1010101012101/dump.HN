But just because no one has published a paper with a controlled experiment doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t work.

It&#x27;s morbid to think, but someone probably died to figure out that some plants are poisonous. Now extend that to thousands of herbs that may treat pain such as weed or may treat gout. Its not an efficient process but there was an observer that recorded the data when someone took a herb. That observer may not have recorded the data but s/he may spread it by word. This is sort of like an expert that gives small weights to its neighbors in a training group. So over time and through many iterations (sort of like a training group that iterates through many cycles), some final accumulated &quot;common truth&quot; is collected. That is analogous to a fuzzy logic or probability in whether a herbal medicine may work.<p>But that&#x27;s with only 1 herb. Even with just 1000 herbs, a 2 herb combination is already half a million.

No complaints, no problems with reliability, decent trackpads and generally solid builds (not Apple-solid, but they are also not Apple-priced as you point out). For a while, they were the only company making decent 13&quot; with discrete graphics.<p>The thing that I found incomprehensible, and somewhat tangential to the grandparent, is how ASUS manages to screw up distribution so badly. They release slightly different models at slightly different times in different geographic regions, and it is usually impossible to buy, say, the European or Asian versions, in the US. A year ago I was quite literally ready to throw money at them in exchange for a UX303LN to replace my aging U36SG, but my dream model was only available in Europe. The only two options I could get in US both had something wrong with them. Repeat: they actually manufactured a laptop to the exact specifications that I wanted, but didn&#x27;t give me a way to buy it.<p>Considering they have global distribution channels, it don&#x27;t imagine it actually being hard to make all models globally available, so the only other explanation I have is forced market segmentation: the two models available in US were pretty much the lowest and the highest end, with nothing in the middle.<p>I had been waiting to see if UX303UB will make it to US, or if it will suffer the same fate.

The &quot;growth in the economy&quot; will be lost when credit must inevitably contract again. expanding credit = more $ in circulation, more goods will be consumed, less goods in market, less goods invested in the long run. Government&#x27;s spending is income to businesses, which increases tax revenues. As this gets spent and re-spent and invested, it leads to over-investment for a short period of time, because businesses re-invest the income to produce goods, and the government is unable to increase their spending exponentially to consume those goods without raising taxes. The government must eventually repay the debt it has borrowed, and by forcing interest rates down to reduce its obligations, the income to the private sector from investment in government bonds is reduced. Private sector income is further reduced by expansion of taxation. The reduced income meaning less $ is available to purchase the increased goods that came from the increased government spending, causing temporary deflation that you see today. Expanding available credit to subprime borrowers is the last gasp of the economy trying to keep the expansion of credit before contraction over takes and economic decline returns to the economy[1].<p>So far the data works out. Labor participation dropping, private investment & private consumption going down, deflation widespread.<p>Lower savings rate = lower long term economic growth.

10344425,comment,10343342,10343657,0,0,rcurry,,,"Oh, you&#x27;re going to love this - I worked for a firm that developed electronic trading software, back in the late 90s. They &quot;encrypted&quot; their incoming connections with a simple XOR scheme that used a &quot;key&quot; which was, basically, a random number. You want to guess how they generated the random number? They seeded the random function with the current time... now, almost all of their clients would just leave their trading systems running overnight, so in the morning all the clients would reconnect at just about the exact same time (market open), so then 90% of the clients would end up using the same &quot;key&quot; to encrypt their sessions.<p>Now, ordinarily it would be bad enough that almost all of your clients are using the same encryption key, but it got much worse from here - turns out there was a bug in a proxy server they had written, so that every once in a while client B&#x27;s traffic would be routed into client A&#x27;s session, and hilarity would ensue; because the &quot;keys&quot; were the same, Client B&#x27;s traffic looked like normal traffic from client A, so nobody could ever figure out why Client A would call us up and complain that he was getting fills for orders that he&#x27;d never sent! It took me forever to figure out WTF was going on, but one day I was watching a logging display and noticed garbled traffic showing up in Client A&#x27;s logs, and it was garbled because it was a user who actually didn&#x27;t auto-logon at 0930 in the morning and subsequently had a different encryption &quot;key&quot; resulting in his traffic not being decoded properly. From there, it became obvious what the problem was.<p>Edit: Yeah, yeah, I know - you&#x27;re thinking &quot;Wait, XOR? shared secret? But, but... how did they do key exchange?&quot; Well, how the heck else would you send a client the secret key for the session - in plain text, when the client first logs on, of course!",1444198253

3069447,comment,3069299,3069299,4,0,shabble,,,"For all the potential parallels with the music industry, I think there are quite a few significant differences.<p>Firstly, what are the current equivalents of a mobile App Store for (pirated) music? There are definitely a bunch of places you can find it if you look, but few of them are as ""one-stop-shop"" as current app stores.<p>Secondly, does pirated music often outrank the artists/album name/track titles in general internet searches? Most of the time you'll get the artist, maybe some unofficial fan sites, and some dodgy-SEO lyrics/""free if you pay for our questionable rapidshare style hosting"" that probably doesn't even have the content.<p>If you consider piracy-specific search engines, like TPB or whatever napster/gnutella mutated into, then you're more likely to find real content, but that requires knowing where to look in the first place.<p>If you consider 'your VC' as an artists music label, then they've probably already got some kind of enforcement system going on. You probably won't have to do all the 'policing' yourself - it's their loss just as much as yours (if not more, due to some of the interesting accounting) if copies aren't getting paid for.<p>All in all, it seems like a fairly weak metaphor, although I can see how it could become more of a problem in the future.<p>Edit: I forgot to mention ""<i>Theyre doing the best they can, they say.  Most of all, theyre complying with the law, they say.</i>"" - I can't imagine many people who download pirated music do so without realising that it's illegal and/or immoral. Legitimate looking services like streaming sites are harder to judge - they might have a license for the content, or they might not.  Compare this to an official platform App Store, where consumers can reasonably expect some level of dilligence in ensuring ownership. And if it becomes necessary, there's some sort of accountability back to the person who uploaded the pirated content.<p>I imagine the author here chose android because it has a less tightly controlled app store, and it may be possible to create anonymous accounts if you're only dealing with free apps (compared to iOS where you need to have bought a dev license to get any signing keys, even for free apps, as I understand it).",1317704108

3069444,comment,3069299,3069299,7,0,jrockway,,,"What is the moral of this story?  ""I'm an App Developer, therefore I shouldn't pirate music""?<p>Ultimately, piracy breaks down to ""people want your stuff, but you've priced it too highly"".  In the case of apps, that's all it is.  In the case of music, it's a little different.  Music is cheap, but it's rare that you can get it in a good format: everything is lossy, and for people with good audio kit and good hearing, that makes the music unusable.  Therefore, people that both Want It Now and want full quality are going to download the FLAC torrent rather than buy lossy MP3s.  (They won't buy the CD because it takes too long for the mailman to deliver it.)<p>The same goes for movies and TV.  Nobody will sell you those things without DRM, so if you use Linux exclusively, you have no option but to pirate the content.  Make every TV show a standard non-DRM'd HTTP download for a buck, and piracy (among people with money) evaporates instantly.  But the content producers want a bogeyman to blame for all their problems, so they intentionally keep piracy alive.<p>(If there were no such thing as the ability to pirate movies, people still wouldn't have bought the 88th redo of Star Wars.  We liked it the first time.  But it's easier for Lucas to blame the evil greedy pirates than his evil greedy self.)",1317704042

Despite the seething tone of a few sentences, the points he make sarcastically are actually decent points. From sentence to sentence, I go from being convinced that he's trying to be against music piracy to being convinced of the opposite.  When he says<p>> <i>They tell you your business model is broken.  You should make money some other way.  Maybe you should sell t-shirts with your companys name on them, or put on events of some kind and charge for tickets.  Thats where the real money is.  Paid apps are a thing of the past, they say.</i><p>I can't help but think, Yeah, I actually do think that. Like it or not, distribution of quality media was a big part of the value provided by the music industry before the digital age and the internet. I'm not making an argument for or against the ethics of the piracy itself, but I think music producers (both big studios and ""little guys"") are unwise to rely on legislation and lawsuits to protect their business.",1317704007

That may be good news if you're Google or a carrier, but it's bad news if you're a developer.<p>To me fair if Android is part of the ""Google way"" and maybe the solution is to have advertising bring in revenue (which goes back to AdSense). On the other hand iOS reminds of the Mac back in the day: The users seem to be willing to pay for software -- however that software better be damn good.<p>So perhaps the solution is to really think of both platforms as being a very different play from each other.

Give the whole thing a few images that it should fail on, and some it should pass. As you learn more about the system and where things fail or just don't add up, add tests there. Its likelier those parts of the code are bad too so refactoring isn't unheard of.<p>To a degree I completely agree with you that some things don't have a easily known answer in the real world. But adding tests to test known things like regressions, just seems like it should be a minimum of testing.

Its basic thrust is that the patent system is ""broken"" to the extent that it does what it's designed to do: grant to an inventor a time-limited privilege to restrict his competitors so that he can earn monopoly profits that will reward him for his invention.<p>The book opens with the story of James Watt.  Watt made a series of improvements to the design of a steam engine and obtained a patent, which he used to interfere with his competition.  In particular, he used the legal system to crush Jonathan Hornblower and his superior engine design; the rest of his competitors had made further improvements, but simply waited for Watt's patent to expire (which had been extended to a 32-year period) before putting them into production.  Watt himself was forced to use a technically inferior design element in his engines for some years to avoid infringing on someone else's patent.  When Watt's patents finally expired and his competitors could freely enter the market, the number of steam engines being produced and the rate at which their efficiency improved both exploded; furthermore, Watt's company continued to increase production and make a profit for years despite the disappearance of the patent protection.<p>It seems clear that the overall effect of Watt's patent protection was to greatly slow down both the development and the wide-scale adoption of improved steam engines--and, as a footnote, that it may not even have been necessary to ensure that Watt made a profit.  Note that Watt was using the patent system exactly as it had been intended.  In the book, we see this happening over and over in detail and across a wide range of industries.",1317701654

3069298,comment,3068790,3069247,3,0,anandkulkarni,,,"Sure, I'd be happy to share our perspective.<p>There are several unskilled tasks where US workers are required and where pay be sizably higher for example, work dealing with sensitive customer data or security-sensitive content is often restricted to US nationals to comply with privacy and chain-of-custody requirements. Companies know that they're getting additional value from US workers and are willing to pay a higher price.<p>But for the record, our workers are neither anonymous nor unqualified, which is a central advantage we have over other companies in the crowd space. This means that where we're looking, we're not talking just about unskilled labor  we're talking about all kinds of work.<p>I wish it were as easy as you suggest to outsource work online for $5 a man-day!  The rise of traditional outsourcing has certainly contributed to a loss of employment in the US over the last twenty years, but it's still incredibly difficult to outsource work online (part of the raison d'etre for MobileWorks!) You'd be hard-pressed to find too many instances of jobs that have disappeared due to online crowdsourcing in the last five years compared to the traditional outsourcing economy. Given the scope of outsourcing's effects, crowdsourcing is likely to be one of the few ways we can draw work back into the US.",1317700969

3069294,comment,3068122,3068506,2,0,danudey,,,"You have to understand Adobe's view of Flash. The reason they were pushing so hard for Flash support is that they wanted to be the gateway to multimedia and interactivity on mobile devices. For the longest time, Flash was how you played video on the web, and Flash was how you made rich, interactive websites. When iOS came along it threatened that, and Adobe wanted to protect their stranglehold in order to maximize their profits (e.g. of Adobe's flash content creation tools).<p>They've now realized that this isn't going to happen; people are abandoning Flash Player in favour of more compatible, more nimble technologies. Adobe's a big company, but they know which way the wind is blowing, and they've responded by shifting with it.<p>The way things are looking, 'Adobe Flash' (the content authoring tool) is going to move to being an HTML5-and-fall-back-on-Flash-Player tool (or vice-versa). Eventually, Flash Player will die the death it deserves, and 'Flash' will just be the name of the authoring tool (along with Dreamweaver or Coda).<p>Basically, Adobe wanted to lock up (or at least make a lot of money at) the cross-platform mobile dev environment. They realized they can't do it with Flash Player/swf content, so now they're trying to do it with Phonegap Build and HTML5 content. More power to them.",1317700809

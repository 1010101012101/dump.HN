This is currently a major problem for me that I&#x27;m not entirely sure how to handle still.<p>I&#x27;m young, never went to college, and my experience is entirely through work in the financial area (with side projects).  In a lot of ways, I&#x27;ve fallen into the &quot;Jack of all trades, master of none&quot; spectrum. Give me any complex problem and I can generally solve it, even if I don&#x27;t have experience with it. I have a very good track record and most previous bosses regard me very highly. My skills aren&#x27;t entirely traditional, but they work pretty damn well.<p>That changed when I followed a senior colleague into a new position as a newly minted senior linux admin. As soon as I joined, I received an asinine amount of anger of nepotism or where suggestions are generally viewed as naive, then ignored. Two of those naive things were, &quot;why does QA have root access? Why are the root ssh keys the same as prod and QA?&quot; and &quot;can we fix the DNS setup so that we don&#x27;t need a CAB approval to run four root-owned scripts to push /etc/hosts to 95% of prod servers?&quot;. If it weren&#x27;t that most of the environment isn&#x27;t documented and makes our lives hell, I wouldn&#x27;t bring these things up. On top of that, we&#x27;re a large web company, so it&#x27;s insane that these things are trivialized.<p>I&#x27;d like to get out of it, but at the same time, I feel like if I can get out of if, I can get out of most things. It&#x27;s a complete brainfuck and killed most of my confidence at this place.<p>Imposter syndrome is difficult.",1446268466

The only ways to increase it are to increase births or decrease deaths.  The article isn&#x27;t convincing that the U-shaped graphs are predominantly from increased birth rates.<p>What is usually described is the pattern is birth rates decline as life expectancy rises, but the lifespan itself hasn&#x27;t changed.  Because so much of the life expectancy increase has occurred within the last couple of lifespans, and it hasn&#x27;t globally reached the lifespan limit, we haven&#x27;t seen population level off yet.<p>But even when we do extend the lifespan, there will still be a death rate.  And if the trend continues, the longer it gets the fewer births there will be.  As we approach practical immortality, the dangers of catastrophes will be greater.  That&#x27;s the long-term population problem - when we only have one birth per year, and some disaster wipes out a million people.",1446268447

I have talked to two guys who were let out after, I believe seven for one, and the other guy was in over a decade.<p>They told me how their release went.  This was a few years ago, but I doubt things have change.  They both told me they were given a little under $200.<p>One guy, slightly older, was just looking for a place to sleep.  I think he ended up under a bridge.  He didn&#x27;t mention having and support(family, etc.).<p>The other guy went to a flea bag motel in San Rafael.  They wanted $150/night.  He crossed the bridge and went to Oakland to buy some dope to sell.  He figured he could slowly get into a room by selling dope on the streets.  When talking to him, I had no advice.  I did call a shelter I knew of, and they said it was only for women.<p>I didn&#x27;t know either well enough to take in, and my roommates wouldn&#x27;t understand any senerio.   My point is if I was in my thirties, like the guy who went back to dealing drugs; I thought, I just might have done the same thing.<p>The thought of sleeping under a bridge, and then getting harrrased by authorities for being homeless just seemed like being in prison.<p>Both guys didn&#x27;t take parole, and finished their entire sentences.  I&#x27;m not sure if I would opt for parole either.<p>I related to these guys on a lot of ways.  I wondered what I would do after doing time.  I am essentially a loner, and the few friends I had died.  I&#x27;m not that old, but my best friends just happened to be 20 years older than me.  I would have no one when getting out.  No support.

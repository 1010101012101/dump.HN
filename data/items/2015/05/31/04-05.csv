Later, I joined CS. There were some great characters that turned up in my house in Qingdao, China (right by the ferry-ride to Korea) .. global cycle-tourists, Japanese-American documenters of vanishing island dance traditions, and a schizophrenic East German woman. The latter was our last guest due to the difficulty of the experience. I never actually stayed with anyone else, only provided a room and sort of free tour guide services which is a big unmentioned portion of what these networks are/were.<p>I still get emails from CS though .. including one this morning from a Canadian who typically laments, in English: <i>I have had a great trip so far but unfortunately have not got to meet and connect with many chinese people due to language barriers.</i> Imagine that.<p>(Edit in reply to Michael below (out of posts): From the statistics at <a href=""https://www.warmshowers.org/country_count"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.warmshowers.org/country_count</a> it looks like Europe by far holds the most numerous number of members in the smallest geographical area, ie. it should be easiest to navigate solely by WarmShower hosts in this region.<p>Typical living costs for cycle touring Europe are 5 (stretch but possible) to 10 (feasible) to 15 (comfy) EUR/day for food. If you can budget 20 you can get drunk too. Add 5 for museums, I reckon you&#x27;re good. 25EUR is about 28USD. The exchange rate is the best it has been in 10 years. Go now!!!)",1433048284

From as far back as early 2014 there have been a large PR campaign to push for unionization, from trying to demonize companies like Uber or Instacart which pay a minimum amount to the people that make the companies work, to stuff like this which tries to position the world as unaffordable as the &quot;rich&quot; race away with the money.<p>But submarine PR or not, its important to put stories you see in the context of who benefits and how.

9633122,comment,9632928,9632928,0,0,tacon,,,"According to a recent Mixergy interview with founder Casey Fenton, Couchsurfing tried for years and years to be approved as a 501(c)3 organization (basically, a charity) so they could receive grant money to support cultural exchanges.  Eventually the IRS gave them a final, non-appealable determination of non-status.  Apparently, the cultural exchange aspect was not a strong enough reason when most people probably couchsurf to save money.  So their business model was broken, and they had to stop being a non-profit and become for profit, which, at that point, costs $1 million to convert.  I presume this is because non-profits must give away their assets to another non-profit if they cease operations.  So $1 million in VC dollars plus other investment converted them into a for profit.  Alas, not with such great results.  I think it is unfortunate the way the meme has spread that the founders were just making a money grab.<p><a href=""http://mixergy.com/interviews/casey-fenton-couchsurfing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixergy.com/interviews/casey-fenton-couchsurfing/</a>",1433047470

9633116,comment,9632469,9632732,0,0,pauleastlund,,,"Everywhere I&#x27;ve worked and to my knowledge everywhere I&#x27;ve interviewed has considered culture fit. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s always as pernicious as you&#x27;re describing. When done right, hiring for culture fit means some combination of &quot;don&#x27;t hire people who aren&#x27;t excited to work here&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t hire assholes, no matter how well they code.&quot; Both of those are important filters, and I don&#x27;t think either of them is unfair to the applicant.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;ve also seen teams where it meant &quot;don&#x27;t hire anyone who isn&#x27;t a workaholic,&quot; and teams where it meant something like &quot;don&#x27;t hire anyone who is going to wreck the hard-partying vibe of the workplace.&quot; (I&#x27;ve never seen anything nearly as crazy as &quot;don&#x27;t hire Yankees fans.&quot;) It sucks to get rejected for a job because the current team all hangs out and they don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d dig the vibe. It would also probably suck to get hired into a team that&#x27;s also a close-knit social group that you aren&#x27;t particularly interested in joining. I think the takeaway is that if you get rejected for a team for being a bad cultural fit you&#x27;ve probably dodged a bullet anyway. Go find a job with a team that knows how to make people of all ages and stripes feel welcome.<p>EDIT: I just remembered my favorite &quot;culture fit&quot; interview question of all time. I was head of engineering at a startup that was interviewing around with potential acquirers. I was talking to a senior engineer at one of the companies. He ran me through a couple simple warm-up questions and then hit me with the big one: &quot;If we acquire you, are you likely to up and quit in two months?&quot; I stuttered for about two minutes.<p>It was a great question!

I turned to credit cards, savings, and family to help out. Ultimately, I tried to handle as much as I could, as long as I could. Depending on the type of treatment, you can still work. My clients understood and stuck with me when I had to take a break.<p>I did work up until the really bad parts of treatment. Throat cancer is a very hard course of treatment as you have radiation daily plus weekly chemo. I was very nauseous and tired, but mentally I was ok for a good while. There are pain meds you can take that don&#x27;t mess with your head very much. Take them if they prescribe them.<p>Get the best coverage you can. Fight your insurance company if you have to. Don&#x27;t back down. The last thing they want is a cancer patient getting denied care. I had to fight the insurance company for all the tests up to and including the needle biopsy. After they found it was cancer, the insurance company rolled over and paid for everything without argument. I hit my out of pocket maximum within the first round of treatment.<p>The other patients you will meet can be a great resource. If you go through chemo, it will most likely be a big room with lots of chairs so you can talk to the other patients. Ask about tips and tricks. There&#x27;s lots of good info on how to combat the side effects.<p>Confirm any supplements/vitamins with your doctor as some chemicals can hinder the chemo meds. Buy Ensure Plus. It&#x27;s hard to feel like eating & that&#x27;s a good way to get calories. Make sure you get enough calories. You need energy to fight.<p>Don&#x27;t believe people that tell you X cures cancer. They don&#x27;t fucking have cancer. Go with what the medical community can validate with science. All those treatments have all been debunked thoroughly and there is no conspiracy against vitamin C. Doctors want you to get better. Survival rates have doubled in the last 10 years.<p>Chemo is not worse than cancer. That&#x27;s ancient history. Nowadays the anti-nausea/pain/steroid meds are amazing. It&#x27;s not like the old days where you vomit constantly for a year. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s easy, but it&#x27;s better than it was even 5 years ago.<p>Take it serious. Don&#x27;t give in to fear or negativity. Ask your Doctor to shoot straight and not sugar coat the facts. Don&#x27;t think about the future. Stay in today. Don&#x27;t lay in bed all day. If all you can do get is up just sit outside. Let your friends/family see you sick. You don&#x27;t need to be alone.<p>Choose life. I mean it. Make that choice every day.<p>It&#x27;s hard to explain, but you&#x27;ll face a choice at some point during this path. Choose life.",1433046808

That&#x27;s a functional program, whether I&#x27;m able to convince you of it or not.<p>We&#x27;re going to explain why you&#x27;re wrong down below, but a quick note on the logic you&#x27;re trying to use upon that faulty premise: Just because some processor could potentially be made in a functional manner does not imply that commercial CPUs are done that way.  Do you remember why we&#x27;re talking?<p>> As a final point, consider that your precious C programs and the C compiler can only run because of the CPU, which was not written in C nor in any Von Neumann language - oh no, they were written functionally, with only logic gates, in a dataflow-oriented way<p>You weren&#x27;t talking hypothetical.  You were talking about CPU&#x27;s that people actually use and their relative stability compared to the terrible software that runs on them.  It&#x27;s really obvious to me that this statement, the entire reason I&#x27;m here at all talking to you, was not talking about an abstract Platonic CPU.  That you&#x27;re not admitting it was incorrect and retreating to this ridiculous absurdity is boggling.  But you&#x27;ve managed to be wrong yet again, so let&#x27;s not dwell on the past and just dive into that.<p>> If real-world CPU designers prefer to use state in their processor design that&#x27;s up to them - but the nature and essence of a CPU obviates state, as a bunch of NAND gates suffices for one as Wikipedia puts it.<p>NAND gates can be combined in such a way as to retain state.  The way this reads, I think you&#x27;re assuming that since a single NAND gate cannot retain state it must follow that any combination of them cannot retain state?<p>Look up &quot;D Flip Flop&quot;.  Made out of NAND alone, retains state.  Given how often you talk about functional things, I&#x27;m really really surprised you didn&#x27;t think about the possibility of feeding an output back into an input.  The thing you&#x27;re missing is what combinations are lurking under that description.  I don&#x27;t think you did the slightest bit of imagining or research on those combinations before declaring all circuitry functional.<p>> Clearly I&#x27;m missing something, but I&#x27;m not sure I know what.<p>Luckily we&#x27;ve found it!  You thought all circuits were limited to Combinatorial logic.  You were unaware of Sequential logic.  I hope you will reconsider the <i>nature</i> and <i>essence</i> of CPU&#x27;s in light of this new information.",1433046690

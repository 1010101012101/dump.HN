3288257,comment,3288068,3288131,1,0,law,,,"Also, they're probably hoping that people will have forgotten about the EU's disdain for Facebook's entire profit model[1], which could wreak havoc on their viability in the market. Facebook really needs to step up its game by developing some technology or business method equally as disruptive as they were to the social networking industry in 2004. I would imagine this could take the form of quasi-gamification, where the information people disclose and allow Facebook to use is treated as <i>de facto</i> currency for how they can interact with the site.<p>In that regard, users would receive the service in exchange for something of value to Facebook--information. Their current Statement of Rights and Responsibilities requires users to grant Facebook a ""non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook.""[2] To me, this is unconscionable, since the service you receive remains constant, while what you 'pay' (the consideration) varies with your level of usage. While one could reasonably argue that the quality of service you receive increases with respect to your level of interaction (i.e., you can't chat with friends until you connect with friends), there's a certain level of unforeseeability inherent in Facebook's intended use at the time you disclose that information (such as making a friend request, wall post, liking a page, etc.)<p>There are some even more troubling issues, as well. Interacting with third-party services via the application platform (by installing apps) gives those services access to your information. Once they have it, you're bound by <i>their</i> terms of use and privacy policies. I'd love to see the exhaustion rule/first-sale doctrine[3] discussed vis-a-vis data privacy, since I'm unsure whether it would apply to ""data."" We saw this discussed tangentially by the web sites attempting to create marketplaces to sell used MP3s[4]--the first-sale doctrine allows you to resell used books, used CDs, etc., but can it allow service providers to sell its copy of ""used"" data? What about the putative buyers of ""used"" data--are they bound by Facebook's Special Provisions Applicable to Developers/Operators of Applications and Websites? All of these are questions with answers that could have an extremely disruptive impact on Facebook's entire profit model.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8917836/Facebook-faces-a-crackdown-on-selling-users-secrets-to-advertisers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8917836/Faceb...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/terms.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/terms.php</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110218/12432213167/yet-another-company-says-it-can-help-you-sell-used-mp3s.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110218/12432213167/yet-an...</a>",1322524510

3288215,comment,3285890,3287759,2,0,mazelife,,,"Your point, as I am understanding it is something along the lines of, ""as a responsible employer, it's incumbent upon me to gather as many data points about a candidate as possible; sure some of them may not correlate strongly with whether a candidate will be successful or not, but every bit helps me get a full picture."" It's an understandable position to some extent, but here's the reason I think it rubs people (myself included) the wrong way: people discriminate between their public (read: work) lives and their private lives. Some of your data points are public, some are not. For example: the reason that no one has an issue with you calling my boss to discuss my history if I'm applying to you for a job is that you're discussing the public face I present at work each day: ""Is this guy reliable? Does he make deadlines? Can he talk to clients or customers?"" In other words all things that directly bear on how well I do my job. GPA isto some extent simliarit's the most useful metric in dealing with candidates who don't have work experience, and the underlying question is the same: this candidate's ""job"" for the last four years was getting her CS degree, so how good was she at it?<p>Social network stalking is a bit of a red herring. If a person has bad enough judgement that they leave a public record of (crazy|nasty|racist|sexist|etc.) sentiments, that's one thing. But would you the employer ask me the job candidate to friend you on Facebook because I've restricted my posts and photos to being viewed by friends only, and you want to rifle thorough them to find evidence anything objectionable? I doubt it. To me this is the same thing as asking for my credit score: why should I reveal my personal life to you? [1] At the risk of drawing too broad a point, this kind of thing is part of a continuing and subtle erosion of employees' right to their own private lives. Companies that ask me to work indefinite 60 hour weeks as a salaried employee are of a piece with those who want to know my credit score: they are companies that are asking for more of my life than I feel they have a right to, and I will pass them by. You may be OK with losing candidates who don't want to provide you their personal data, but if a credit score really is only a secondary (at best) data point, why risk losing an otherwise-superb employee over it?<p>[1] To those who say ""a credit score isn't all _that_ personal, I think of two examples right off the top of my head. I decline to hire applicant A because his credit score was low. As is his right by law under FCRA, he asks to know if that was why we declined to hire, at which point he may then say ""My credit score is poor because my wife left last year and I'm putting 3 kids through school,"" or ""I'm HIV+ and my last job had terrible health insurance."" There are lots of very personal reasons a person my have a bad credit score, and by basing a hiring decision on that, I'm forcing them to revel them to me if they want the job; that personally makes me very queasy.",1322523849

AWS is a big one, in that you don't have to manage your own data centers, the underlining hardware gets continually upgraded, and you will realize the improve performance without doing your own hardware cycles. They can focus their effort on improving their product. If this is a hit, then they will be forced to improve AWS latency, or find innovated ways to make their product better. I don't think they <i>should</i> put that effort into building out their own end points.<p>Who says AWS cannot manage these large virtual end points. There are already have several AWS West, AWS East, EU, Asia, etc. We might see a time where they are closer to you. Maybe even a perring agreement away ;) Exciting times.",1322523651

People want to do a pairwise test on the top and bottom right away, without realizing that, even if all are equal, the top and bottom frequently look different.  Or the flip side of that error is that people see that the G-test says that there is a difference, and conclude that the current top one must be better than the current bottom one.

3288024,comment,3287475,3287475,4,0,law,,,"<i>However, Facebook maintains that users prefer seeing ads that are linked to their interests and lifestyles. Also, the company reminds us that private information stays private, even when data is used to sell ads, because information is collected in aggregate and is anonymized.</i><p>This troubles me, because information being collected and 'anonymized' is somewhat of a misnomer. I think many would contest any assertion that data capable of disassembly into its constituent parts (assuming each constituent part to be a <i>unique</i> combination of variables represented in the aggregate) comports with anonymity. I'm generally not one to praise governmental regulatory agencies for their technological prowess, but the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services really ""got it"" with HIPAA's de-identification standard.<p>HHS understands the importance of aggregating healthcare data and conducting statistical research, and does not let HIPAA preclude this from occurring. Instead, HIPAA outlines a ""safe harbor"" approach that limits a covered entity's criminal/civil liability in the event of a breach if and only if the covered entity removes 18 identifiers and has no actual knowledge that the remaining information could identify the individual. These identifiers include names, dates, geolocational codes covering populations less than 20,000, etc. Alternatively, covered entities may opt to use a 'statistical' approach by hiring a qualified statistician (or other scientific expert) who can use acceptable analytic techniques to conclude that the risk of identifying the person from the disclosed information is very, very small.[1]<p>A safe harbor approach to large-scale data privacy would be absolutely wonderful. Using statistics to prove the anonymity of data being collected/used by Facebook is nonsensical, since by default, we've given them a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to 'use' anything we submit to them. Contracts of adhesion, in my opinion, are more of the problem since there's no good way to 'make change' for the information that you submit. For example, someone very active on Facebook might arguably be 'worth more' to the company than someone who isn't, but both receive the same product.<p>EDIT: A safe harbor approach to large-scale data privacy isn't even unknown. See COPPA[2], for example.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&rgn=div8&view=text&node=45:1.0.1.3.77.5.27.9&idno=45"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&rgn...</a> 45 CFR 164.514(b)(1)--(2).<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childrens_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childrens_Online_Privacy_Protec...</a>",1322521585

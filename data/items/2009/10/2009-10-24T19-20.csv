I took Celexa for over a year, it worked OK but not great, and then after reading the wikipedia article on treatment of depression, I tried SAM-e, which works much better (200mg Jarrows in the morning with a B-complex supplement to break down the homocysteine).

The VM-T would have been underpowered for the Buran, it was really used to carrying smaller parts and only had a payload of 50,000Kg (1/5 of the An-225, and only slightly higher than the 42,000Kg of the Buran orbiter).<p>The An-124 on the other hand was too short, even though it had adequate payload capacity. So the An-124 would have been needed to be extensively modified to carry the Buran anyway. They may have over-engineered it somewhat, but then better to over-engineer than under-engineer and end up with an embarassing accident.<p>The 747-100 that Nasa chose to use for the SCA didn't need quite as much modification to make it usable, and had a fairly high payload rating anyway (around 170,000Kg), and was long enough to carry the shuttle.",1256413897

In the end, coffee doesn't seem to significantly impact my concentration. If I get 8 hours of sleep, don't drink any alcohol the day before, and stay hydrated, I can be productive no matter how much coffee I drink. Even more, I found that Morning Coffee makes me dehydrated and irritable, so I usually drink a cup or two after lunch to keep myself going.

From my perspective a lot of what i see on macs today has it's origins in the open source world and apple wouldn't be where it is today with open source (webkit came from khtml, mac os x kernel partly from freebsd, calendar server is based on twisted, afaik). Now you tell me that the company that tries to lock it's customers in their ecosystem with a lot of proprietary software&hardware (hello quicktime, hello itunes), that it's particularly open source friendly? It sure as hell is not. I could nearly bet that MS does more open source then apple. If it's not already the case, apple is heading in that direction.",1256410812

736111,comment,735687,735831,0,0,jrockway,,,"The whole civil system is an end-run around the Constitution anyway.  The government can't take all the money you'll ever earn, but they can allow some corporate entity to.  (Totally different, see!  Nobody's rights are being violated!)<p>(Incidentally, the Constitution says ""cruel AND unusual"" not ""cruel OR unusual"".  So if a cruel punishment is routinely applied, that makes it not unusual, and totally legal.)",1249113188

736108,comment,735917,736080,0,0,dbz,,,"I'm not trying to feed the troll here, but I feel it should be noticed that this is a hacker community, and hackers don't generally dig fence post holes all day, trenches, or lay bricks all day. I'm sure some do, but programmers, who program for a living, <i>need</i> to be in front of a computer of some kind. Not all <i>hard</i> jobs involve labor. I'm guessing you've never had to sit in front of a computer and think logically for a week -getting very little sleep all the while. If you had, you would not only have <i>not</i> written that post, but would learn that thinking, and not moving while you think (limited movement), can be <i>stressful</i> and <i>hard</i> to say the least.<p>Well, that's my two cents, and from my point of view, and I am sure others share it, when you said ""<i>But physically, if you're saying 'computing' is hard</i>,"" I dare you to do something some of the greater ""computers"" (people who computer) have done. You know, like make an operating system from scratch without ever seeing code of one, you know, like Steve Jobs did, for example.<p>Ok. I hope that didn't come out as a rant, and if it did, I apologize, but think about it, computing can be hard.",1249112291

The most effective technique I have discovered recently for concentrating is turning the damn thing off. Sounds crazy I know, but you'd be surprised how productive it can be to take an hour or two with a pen and paper attacking your problem with no electronics present.",1249112288
736106,comment,735892,735892,0,0,scythe,,,"The results around 22 aren't too surprising: most people will probably quickly figure out that the target cannot possibly be above 66.67, but few will realize that this implies that the target will be below 44.44. If you assume the guesses will be randomly distributed from 0 - 66, you get a target of 22, which isn't a bad guess for most of the times this experiment was performed on the proles.",1249112080
736105,comment,735677,735694,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I have to say it makes me a little uneasy how quickly this is happening. Isn't the market supposed to sort this out on its own?<p>I'm not familiar with the relevant law, so maybe I just don't understand. Is it illegal to run a proprietary phone platform and lock competitors out?. Isn't that basically what has always been the case in the pre smart phone era?<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't like what Apple/AT&T does and as a developer I'm not going to sign up to a platform that puts me in such a weak position. But I see that as an issue between me and Apple. I'm not sure why I need the government in it.",1249112020

Ironically, being as the head of the FCC co-founded a YC-ish thing, it's entirely possible that he also reads Hacker News, and almost certain that he reads TechCrunch â€“ so it's really not surprising at all to see that they're monitoring the nerdier channels.",1249111408

The real situation is that developers know that they are walking a fine line with applications that ""threaten their platform"".

The largest amount of changes has gone into this release than any other pygame release.<p>- bug fixes for backwards compatibility issues introduced in pygame 1.8.x series. old games like solarwolf and libraries like PGU work again.<p>- experimental camera webcam module (still in development).<p>- experimental midi module based on portmidi and pyportmidi (99% complete).<p>- experimental gfxdraw module based on SDL_gfx (including AA circles, textured polygons and other goodness).<p>- python3, and python3.1 support mostly completed. Some modules still remain to be completed - but mostly it's working.<p>- nokia mobile phone s60 support.<p>- improved OSX support (dropped pyobjc dependency, improved installer, sysfont now works on OSX).<p>- pygame.examples + pygame.tests included with pygame. This makes testing easier, and also makes learning pygame more fun and easy.<p>- cleanup of examples, and addition of new examples.<p>- new tools to aid in development of pygame itself, better compilation documentation.<p>- py2app, and py2exe support improved.",1249110863

736089,comment,736038,736077,0,0,colins_pride,,,"I would read even more recent stuff. I agree on Che.  How about reading about Kevin Kelly and Louis Rossetto?  Bob Hunter created Greenpeace out of nothing.  Petraeus revolutionized the most powerful military in the history of the world.  It's through a mix of ancient literature, philosophy and political economics that one gains perspective on human nature.  And human nature does not, has not, and will not change.  But the structure of the world evolves, making modern revolutionaries much more interesting.  When I know what Kolakowski had to say about Marxism, I'm going to go move past Marx and spend more time on Popper who hasn't really been rebutted (to my knowledge) yet.<p>Kolakowski -> <a href=""http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14120114"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=...</a>",1249110395

It's sickening to observe such hypocritical behaviour but, for example, my employer doesn't allow their employees reading patent texts (at least during work hours, IIRC) in fear of provable infringement -- yet they apply for patents themselves whenever they can, apparently just for defensive purposes!<p>How much more actual, productive work could we do if we didn't have to keep the best of our people writing documents for patent applications, occupying their minds with such frivolous patent games while still working our arses off to make a difference in the real world?",1249110167

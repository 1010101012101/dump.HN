Any problems that it brings to the table I will gladly solve, sice my brain has a lot of better stuff to do than to memorize all the bugs and quirks of all the stupid browser engines out there.<p>So while you real developer bunch smugly program your assembly, I will gladly carry the flag of an untermensch programmer and just ship the goddamn product.

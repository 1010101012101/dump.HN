I also ensure that everybody knows where I came from with a huge Razorback flag on my wall.",1244371994

645818,comment,645679,645739,0,0,akamaka,,,"This article is not either of the things you suggested.  It's not jargon and babble, and the argument is pretty clear: cinsumerist society is on the brink of collapse.<p>The problem is that AdBusters has been saying this over and over in every single issue since I first read it, years ago.  They must be pretty happy with the recession, since it somewhat legitimatizes their predictions, for now.  Once the economy recovers, though, I'm sure they'll still keep beating the same drum.<p>AdBusters is kind of like a magazine version of ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"", published in 1776.  At the time, the Britsh were very concerned by the state of their own empire, and gobbled up this bleak and pessemistic (and highly misleading) version of history.<p>There's always going to be someone with an apetite for this sort of thing, so that keeps AdBusters in business.",1244371123

645810,comment,644699,645494,0,0,kragen,,,"Yes, the problem is exactly analogous.  And whenever you manipulate equations of rational expressions, or manipulate any equations by using division, you have to be careful that you don't accidentally invalidate your logic by inadvertently dividing by zero.<p>A classic example is <a href=""http://www.math.utoronto.ca/mathnet/falseProofs/first1eq2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.utoronto.ca/mathnet/falseProofs/first1eq2.ht...</a> — you get from a correct equation to 2 = 1 by simply canceling an innocuous factor (a² - ab) from both sides, the problem being that the innocuous factor happens to be equal to 0.<p>You can avoid this problem by changing your reasoning procedure.  Old incorrect procedure; given:<p><pre><code>    xy = xz\n</code></pre>\nconclude<p><pre><code>    y = z\n</code></pre>\nCorrected procedure: given:<p><pre><code>    xy = xz\n</code></pre>\nconclude:<p><pre><code>    y = z ∨ x = 0\n</code></pre>\nIn many circumstances you can then immediately eliminate the x=0 case, e.g. when x is a numeric constant other than 0, or when x=0 → y=z by some other chain of reasoning.  In other circumstances it turns out to complicate your proof enormously, and in cases like the fallacious proof I mentioned above, it actually makes the proof impossible.<p>So the surprising discovery that this basic set-creation operation — the set of all objects meeting some criterion — contained a pitfall analogous to that of division occasioned some consternation.  What was the analogous correction to make to reasoning with set theory?  And once that was settled, all of the proofs made under the old system had to be checked wherever they used this fundamental operation.",1244370257

Currently it's hard to differentiate those from previously seen submissions that I'm just not interested in (95% of TechCrunch stories, etc) and are therefore not going to vote up.<p>I propose that a new feature (equal to what's been existing on Reddit for as long as I can remember) be implemented: the ability to hide stories -- personalization.<p>I realize that this could incur some additional strain on the HN servers. A lightweight cookie solution (with some decaying) could potentially be used.<p>A quick search shows that this feature have been talked about before:<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=625535\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=446171\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=137247\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=446080<p>I could implement a Greasemonkey script using GM_get/setValue for persisting the IDs of hidden stories.

The XML foundation is a huge barrier to implementation and is the perfect example of counter-productive adoption of buzzword-of-the-day ideologies, handicapping a whole ecosystem for years afterwards.</i><p>As someone who has written the odd XMPP client I can only say: Amen, Hallejujah.<p>The idea and birdview architecture of Jabber is great. The execution is so horrible that most people who had the misfortune to work with it only want it to die ASAP.<p>Most of the problems stem from unfortunate timing. Jabber was invented in the late 90's when XML and Java engineering practices were hyped as the Next Big Thing™. Had it been invented only a few years earlier or later then we might not have anything to complain about today.<p>Well, my hopes are on google to end the insanity. They have plenty of skilled engineers working on wave. Once those engineers grow tired of the mess they might just go and replace it with something sane.",1244369178

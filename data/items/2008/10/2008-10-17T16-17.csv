335771,comment,335514,335514,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"The danger in the freemium business model is understanding just what features are worth paying for and which ones are not.<p>About 12 years ago there was a circuit-board layout program (PADS-PCB) that followed this model. The paid version started at about $900 (and went up to about $5,000 IIRC depending on features you wanted) and the free version was limited to small circuit boards and 70 components. I downloaded the free version to use in my ""basement business"" and never needed to upgrade: 70 components was plenty for me. Talking to a salesperson a few years later, I found out that the company lost money hand-over-foot because only relatively few companies needed to build boards larger than the freeware version could handle: the market was changing and electronic component integration was increasing so a single part could now do what a couple years before would have required 5-10 parts. Most of the companies that were happy with the free version would have had no problem paying the $900 had the free version not been available. The software was excellent and even the free version would have been worth the $900, but obviously if it did what you needed, there was no reason to pay.",1224262627
335770,comment,335392,335392,0,0,pedalpete,,,"I've been thinking about this lately. I suppose because similar to Adam, my start-up is music focused so music is a big part of my life. And because HearWhere.com (my start-up) is focused on connecting people with live music, I see and hear the enormous volume of musicians trying to make it.<p>But start-ups do/should have groupies. You just don't get to actually SEE them. But I (and I assume other start-ups) regularly get e-mails of support from users. That's fan-mail! Those are your groupies. 
Better than just telling you how great you are (like band groupies do), e-groupies (or start-up groupies) give you ideas on how to improve. They tell you what they would like to see. They tell you what works, and what doesn't. They are the dedicated fan base.<p>If you don't have them, find them. Make sure there is a way for them to contact you. If after a few months, you find that they truly don't exist, then maybe (just maybe) you are the equivalent of a hobo with a harmonica thinking he's a rock star!",1224262606

Ultimately, before you go into a business –it is necessary to do your research about the market and your competitors, such as, marketplace trends, problems with product and services, how problems can be corrected, get ideas for new products and applications-submit your own questions to discussion groups to get valuable feedbacks- it is up to the business owner to be successful.

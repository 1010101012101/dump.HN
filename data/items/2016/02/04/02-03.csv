They just proved that if the entire Redis cluster goes down they can get it back in 2.5 hours. It&#x27;s almost certainly a caching layer, so there is no permanent data loss. If they fix the application bootstrap dependency on a Redis connection, and they add monitoring to more easily see in the future when the Redis cluster is the problem, next time that time period will probably be way shorter.<p>So, a very small risk of an hour or so of downtime sometime in the future which will not cause data loss, or tens of thousands of dollars a month for a failover cluster?

For all that weight the ammo runs out somewhere between 12 and 20 seconds.<p>The most efficient way to destroy things on the ground is with guided missiles and bombs.

11031651,comment,11029263,11031382,0,0,dperfect,,,"(responding to your comment and the other comment about a possibility of attackers)<p>I agree that the baseline should be independent, autonomous, safe operation of each vehicle without any network/cooperation, but in time it&#x27;s going to go beyond that. I have no doubt that it will happen.<p>Once independent operation is proven to be reasonably safe and dependable for everyday use, it will have achieved a certain degree of safety and efficiency - significantly better (at least in safety) than humans, but still prone to occasional accidents (regardless of who/what is at fault), especially when human drivers are still allowed to drive on the same roads.<p>At that point, people will demand even higher levels of safety (similar to the nines of high availability), and greater efficiency (i.e., speed). Unfortunately, with human drivers sharing the same road, those two demands are at odds with each other; greater efficiency inherently reduces safety. At some point though, the demand will be great enough that we&#x27;ll have to adopt something better - something with a higher level of coordination between vehicles, and where only computer-controlled vehicles can participate.<p>It certainly won&#x27;t be pushed or adopted universally in one step, and it&#x27;ll likely <i>never</i> cover all road infrastructure. It will be adopted first on high throughput routes, much like you have private toll roads today. Instead of paying a toll (or perhaps in addition), your car will enter the roadway by joining the network. Without network compatibility, you&#x27;ll be unable to use the road.<p>Once you&#x27;ve joined the network, however, your vehicle can literally drive at breakneck speeds, avoiding other traffic by incredibly small margins, and all with significantly higher safety than non-networked roads.<p>Of course having a single network controlling vehicles opens up a possibility for attacks, just as modern commercial aircraft can be vulnerable to attack. It will be an issue, but not one without reasonable mitigation strategies and best practices. The &quot;network&quot; in question may not even be centralized in nature, but rather a decentralized, local mesh network with safeguards in place for each vehicle to detect and respond appropriately to situations where the network seems to be guiding vehicles outside safe bounds. There are a lot of ways that it could be implemented, but it&#x27;ll be important (at least to me) that it&#x27;s not all controlled by one government/corporation/entity, but instead rolled out as a set of interoperable industry standards.",1454554383

They typically lose money on symphony orchestras, ballets and performing arts centers. That one is considered low culture and the other considered high culture is not relevant is we assume that the people are being ably represented.<p>This rests on the premise that is is reasonable for taxpayer money to fund any cultural activities at all, &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;.<p>In any case, even accepting this premise, the difference is that the examples of &quot;high&quot; culture you cite are, unlike professional sports stadiums, generally not promoted on the basis of claims that they will contribute to the economic development of their communities; rather, they are generally promoted on the basis of unfalsifiable claims that they will have a positive cultural and educational impact.",1454554346

Thrilling stuff!<p>Also, as a fan of all sports, I have to say there is probably nothing more entertaining(at least to me) than the NFL Red Zone Channel. Almost no stop in the action, skip most replays, see all the big plays, often in real time. Of course playing fantasy football plays a big part in that.<p>Hockey is a great game to watch as well with pretty constant shots and action.<p>Lots of people I know don&#x27;t understand how I like hockey or soccer.

Then it took about two hours to determine that the Redis servers weren&#x27;t booting, and to failover.<p>That&#x27;s honestly pretty unimpressive no matter how you slice it.<p>Setting up a Redis server is easy. Sharding it is easy. Setting up slave systems is easy.<p>What&#x27;s hard is, like most things in life and tech, planning. Planning for failure. Practicing failure. Not by insisting you need a monkey-army, which sounds cool and fun, but by having a staging environment which is mundane and boring. Pull the power plug on a server. See how long it takes to identify the culprit and recover. Figure out what you could have done to identify the issue quicker. Figure out how you could recover quicker.<p>You&#x27;re running Redis, and you haven&#x27;t even setup slave systems in different cabinets? You&#x27;ve never tried pulling the plug on the JBOD to see what might happen? These servers apparently weren&#x27;t even pinging. Why did it take more than 10 seconds to find out they weren&#x27;t running? Why wasn&#x27;t there a dashboard for basic system/process status across all services? Is GitHub&#x27;s operations budget really that tight?<p>Setting up a pair of OpenBSD boxes with pf and HA-Proxy is easy. Making sure CARP picks up on the failover system when the primary fails is pretty easy. Scheduling it, testing it so you know it&#x27;s actually going to work when you need it to is the hard part. Holding people accountable for it&#x27;s uptime when the log says that hasn&#x27;t been done this month is the hard part.<p>Setting up some FreeBSD boxes with DAS is easy. Giving each shard it&#x27;s own slaves is easy. Monitoring the slaves to make sure they&#x27;re actually useful is hard. Making sure you have a one-way failover script fire when the CARP interface fails over is easy. Snapshotting the ZFS filesystems is easy. Simulating breaks by pulling a power plug is hard. Write some garbage to the FS. Unplug the DAS. Unplug the host. Force &quot;up but non-responsive&quot; situations, figure out how to identify them, and how to recover from them.<p>Doing anything reliable with iSCSI is hard. Even Amazon has a poor reputation for it. Do your best to avoid it, and never ever ever buy into vendor promises that it&#x27;ll allow you to just remount your block devices on a different host and never have to worry about data or downtime. IME. YMMV.<p>Using runit to keep your Ruby processes up: Easy. Proper logging, monitoring and alerts because processes are just bouncing constantly? Well, it&#x27;s not rocket science. But it definitely takes discipline.<p>There are people a hell of a lot smarter than me that have been doing this for a lot longer. But some of this stuff is just flat out not acceptable. I&#x27;ve been on those angry-client phone calls. &quot;Inadvertent&quot; should be a trigger word to anyone in Ops. It really means somebody didn&#x27;t do something they should have and it bit them in the ass (at least that&#x27;s what it meant when I said it). Would the app have started fine if boot.rb didn&#x27;t attempt to connect to Redis? That seems pretty far fetched. So that sounds like a red-herring. But what do I know.<p>Setting these things up is not the hard part. Identifying that a host isn&#x27;t responding to ping isn&#x27;t the hard part. Planning, procedures, discipline and execution, day in and day out when things aren&#x27;t on fire to prepare for the day that they are, that&#x27;s the hard part.<p>Maybe Github is has a much smaller Ops team and budget than I would&#x27;ve imagined. Maybe this should be a wake up call to the CEO. I don&#x27;t know. These are just my observations from what was said and having deja-vu thinking about lessons I had to learn the hard way.<p>BTW, I&#x27;m not necessarily trying to bag on the guy getting paged at 3AM. Been there, done that. It sucks. You do the best you can. If anything that I&#x27;m saying has a ring of truth to it, then it&#x27;s a leadership issue. And it&#x27;s not about &quot;give smart people things and get out of their way blah blah bullshit&quot;. This sort of stuff doesn&#x27;t materialize out of thin air and good intentions.<p>OTOH it&#x27;s crazy that Github is single-homed and can&#x27;t afford an F5. :shrug:<p>BTW:<p>> I can bet it would&#x27;ve taken us much longer<p>One of the worst experiences of my professional life was 72 sleepless hours, mostly in a 50F data-center, trying to figure out why the SAN would sporadically drop off servers every other minute. Turns out somebody, not me for a change, set the MTU on the switches to 9000. So whenever a max-frame was used BOOM.<p>But yeah, I&#x27;ve been through Redis failures. It didn&#x27;t take me two hours to get things going again. Load-balancer failures. Database failures (backup sure, but never ever plan to actually use it; it&#x27;s plan Z at best). NFS failures as well. Though those might be pushing it with heads that take almost 10 minutes just to reboot.<p>From the outside 2 hours seems like a very long time to identify and recover from a Redis failure. (Knock on wood.) And it sounds like they didn&#x27;t have Warm systems standing by for failover? That&#x27;s bad...",1454552605

Using 4th and 5th generation aircraft in place of AC-130s [1] and Super Tacanos [2] not only costs more, but is incredibly less effective for the soldiers on the ground.  CAS and the F-35 shouldn’t be used in the same sentence.<p>The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would have cost significantly less (1/4 the total?) if the military hadn’t forced square fighter jets into the round hole of CAS (add up $10k / hr vs $600, plus airborne tankers, plus carriers, plus increased supply costs).  Not only did this cost multiples more, provide less effective support to Americans risking their lives on the ground, it damaged the fleet of fighters for other tasks in the future.  How many flight hours where burned “in country” on already aging platforms?  I know I got some.<p>Senior military aviation leadership boxed themselves into a corner burning up the fleet in ways it shouldn’t have and betting on a do-it-all turd called the F-35.

Dog-fighting is dead and people will scream F-4 / Vietnam, but I’d rather have an extra aim-9x than a fucking gun pod in this day and age [3, 4].

11031506,comment,11029263,11031228,0,0,tempestn,,,"I didn&#x27;t downvote your first comment, but in my opinion the reason it was downvoted was that it amounted to ad-hominem (&quot;Don&#x27;t listen to him because he&#x27;s from Google.&quot;) rather than a reasoned argument like you&#x27;ve posted here.  Sure, it&#x27;s wise to take into account the source of an argument, but you can&#x27;t reasonably stop there.<p>I do disagree with your first point, that an always-running self-driving car having to make more decisions is irrelevant because a car spends the majority of its time moving forward.  I think the point is that a driver assistance system basically only handles that moving forward case.  It may cover 99% of the time, but it only covers a small fraction of the decisions and actions the car has to take.  It&#x27;s the other 1% (probably higher than 1% actually, but it doesn&#x27;t matter) that&#x27;s the tricky part, and it is difficult to iterate from handling the special (if very common) case of basically just moving forward, to handling all the other situations a car can find itself in.  You would quickly lose any easily-understood distinction between what situations the car is and is not able to handle, making it difficult for the human driver to know when their input will be required.",1454551588

11031499,comment,11031039,11031073,0,0,andrewsomething,,,"There seems to be a bit of confusion about how we handle kernels at DO. Hopefully I can clear things up a bit. On newer distro versions (e.g. Ubuntu >= 15.04, Debian 8, Fedora, CoreOS, FreeBSD) we no longer use &quot;external&quot; kernels. You are free to compile and use custom kernels. We&#x27;re happy with what we&#x27;ve seen, and with Ubuntu 16.04 around the corner our default distribution will have support for this as well. After that point, we&#x27;ll be backporting the change to older releases.<p>For Droplets still running with external kernels, we import new ones on a regular basis as they are released. If you happen to need one that hasn&#x27;t been imported yet, just open a support ticket and the team will do so.",1454551469

Since then I&#x27;ve done about £110k in revenue and £11k profit (I&#x27;m in the UK if that matters).<p>This is a very cash-intensive business and I&#x27;m struggling with cashflow. Cashflow finally turned positive in January but now I&#x27;m not being able to grow because all my cash is tied up in my awful payment terms.<p>Recently I had a conversation with a potential customer and we came to the conclusion that it would be beneficial to partner up. The deal we discussed was the following: they take 50% equity and 50% profit share, and in exchange they bankroll me (this is on top of the fact that I get a new customer and they get a new supplier).<p>I know that HN is used to thinking in terms of &quot;cash for equity&quot;, but notice that this is slightly different. It&#x27;s more a &quot;very big zero-interest loan for equity&quot;. I estimate that without the cashflow constraint I could scale this up to about £1m/month in revenue in a year&#x27;s time.<p>My concerns are about possible power issues / deadlock situations. I&#x27;m a single-guy company and they&#x27;re a 20 employees company. If it comes to lawyering up, I&#x27;ll get screwed.<p>Basically, how do I avoid getting screwed and/or deadlock?",1454551219

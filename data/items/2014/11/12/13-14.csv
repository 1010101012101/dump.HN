And for some reason, somebody at Microsoft really wants people to use them anyway.  The first thing that everybody learned was to stay well clear of the drag/drop interface builder and anything that seemed like it existed only to support it.  In 2001, that lopped off roughly 90% of ASP.NET and left one with a really nice platform for development.<p>It&#x27;s actually surprising to hear that it has persisted all the way through to ASP.NET MVC and the new view engines.  I hadn&#x27;t heard of anybody getting bitten by it, had to advise anybody to steer clear of it, or even <i>seen</i> it in any version of VS.NET since 2007.<p>Apologies that the message never made it through.  Don&#x27;t use any of that stuff, and you&#x27;ll find that the Microsoft stack is quite a good platform to build off of.",1415800787

I&#x27;m working in a low-end support role, having done development on the side for nearly 4 years now. Primarily for the web - I&#x27;ve done development and built toy projects with a lot of tools - far too much to list (PHP - Vanilla/Symfony2, JS - Node/Meteor, SQL and NoSQL db&#x27;s, lots of API integrations, experience with lots of IDE&#x27;s and tools, etc).<p>But I find myself (4 years down the line) with basically no finished/polished public projects to call my own and generally uncertain which direction I should head in. I don&#x27;t feel confident applying for any jobs since I as I mentioned, I don&#x27;t have any public work to share, so my CV looks pathetic. The solution is obvious (build some), but I find myself changing my mind about the tech stack half way through and trying something else a lot of the time. I feel like I need to start being a master of one trade rather than jack of none.<p>There was a funny post (either on HN or linked to from HN) a while ago, of somebody trying to choose a tech stack to use/focus on, and that describes me perfectly. I can&#x27;t get anything done for the overwhelming choice...<p>Whilst a lot of web-work is just CRUD, the web is shifting towards an expectation of realtime data or app-like behaviour. So naturally things like Meteor, or a combination of a backend stack with Angular/Ember with Phonegap look promising... but then for anything other than simple apps, the UX is still not quite there, so I look at native app development.. so Android or iOS.. argh!<p>Help?!

8595365,comment,8594702,8595315,0,0,grey-area,,,"<i>HTML AND JS WERE NOT DEVELOPED TO RUN NATIVELY ON DEVICES! WHY WOULD YOU WANT THEM TO RUN ON DEVICES?</i><p>Please don&#x27;t shout. HTML and JS were developed to run on any device, past, present and future. HTML is actually pretty good at presenting most UI state along with documents - the UI of the vast majority of native device apps is really not hard to present as html, the only roadblock is the vendors lack of focus on mobile web view performance. JS is a mixed bag, and as you say pretty rushed, and not the favourite language of many - I wouldn&#x27;t want to write an app in it, though of course it is possible.<p>The choice developers are presented with here is to commit to learning each new API/Language on the continually shifting sands of OS vendor APIs for multiple vendors/devices, or to commit to an open but less performant toolkit they know will be around for a while, but which has the advantage of being stable, cross platform, and not tied to any specific vendor.<p>Clearly you don&#x27;t feel the pressure of being tied to specific vendors and having to produce multiple binaries on a growing array of platforms both mobile and desktop, but others do, and this is mostly why they choose to use web tech on mobile or desktop. It&#x27;s a very political and economic choice not one based on language syntax or capabilities alone, if you attempt to simply compare C and js on a technical level for example you will fail to understand why the choice is made. I fully expect that trend of web everywhere to increase if/when HTML starts offering more choice of languages (NaCl/asm.js) and perhaps more sophisticated layout (though for present uses it&#x27;s not bad for that purpose). At that point, why choose a native API which will be deprecated in 5 years, when you can truly write once and run anywhere (web, mobile, desktop).<p>The people native apps benefit the most is OS vendors, because of lock-in, for both consumers and developers having a more open cross platform tech is clearly desirable (easy to switch platforms or for developers serve all platforms), even if not fully practical at present.",1415800010

8595268,comment,8593261,8594654,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>All the cleverness of static typing falls apart with heterogeneous lists.</i><p>You <i>can</i> have heterogeneous lists in Haskell. What you don&#x27;t have is <i>open</i> heterogeneity as in Scala (where List[Any] is a valid type). You have to decide how much heterogeneity you&#x27;ll allow <i>a priori</i>, like so:<p><pre><code>    data MyLang = Number Double | Str String | Sexp [MyLang] | Fn (MyLang -> MyLang)\n    expr = Sexp [Str &quot;+&quot;, Number 5, Number 7]\n</code></pre>\nWhat Haskell doesn&#x27;t give you (unless you use Data.Dynamic) is <i>open</i> heterogeneity. If you want to add ByteString to the above, you have to recompile it with a new case in the union. While you could add an extensible object-oriented system to Haskell (all major languages being Turing-complete, you can write a Ruby or Lisp in Haskell) the types in this language would probably not be recognized by Haskell. For most cases, this defeats the purpose of using Haskell, because we <i>want</i> the expressive types (at the expense of slightly reduced language expressivity). We&#x27;d rather have a type signature of (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b] than HRubyObject -> HRubyObject -> HRubyObject, with a bunch of runtime error checks (that take time to specify, reduce performance, and clutter source code).<p>With advanced uses of typeclasses, you can buy back a lot of the heterogeneity and code-level expressiveness of dynlangs (at the expense of dealing with complicated type signatures, language extensions, and scary-sounding concepts like &quot;monad transformers&quot;). There&#x27;s little that you &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; do in Haskell, insofar as you can build an arbitrary dynamic language within it. Haskell just requires you to decide <i>a priori</i> how much heterogeneity and reflection you want, and makes it hard to change that on the fly.<p>What I like about Haskell is how much discipline it demands. I don&#x27;t expect to see the static vs. dynamic debate resolved within my lifetime, because those families of languages excel in different ways, but I like the intellectual exercise of having to make sure my design is sound before it even compiles. Static typing isn&#x27;t &quot;a silver bullet&quot; and only catches ~30-50% of errors if used naively, but if you know how to use it and have a good design sense, you can bring that number way up (90%?). If your goal is to write robust code, you spend as much time thinking about testing in Haskell as in Python. The advantage of &quot;the Haskell Way&quot; is that most of those unit tests don&#x27;t exist in code; they&#x27;re implicit in the type system, or very tersely specified (with superior coverage) in QuickCheck.<p>What we want in a language, loosely speaking, is O(log n) added work (&quot;accidental complexity&quot;) in terms of the size of the problem/functionality achieved. We can never get rid of that, but we&#x27;d like it to be sublinear as a function of what we&#x27;re accomplishing. (Since our goals are most often subjective, the big-O notation is used loosely.) Inexpressive languages throw O(n) accidental complexity at you, but poor use of expressive languages throws O(n^2) or worse (in fact, potentially incomputably worse, since arbitrary code comprehension is formally undecidable) <i>maintenance</i> complexity at you. I don&#x27;t know if Haskell is at the O(log n) level, for <i>a priori</i> accidental complexity, yet. But it&#x27;s definitely sublinear (maybe O(n<i></i>1/3)) and, in the real world, that&#x27;s good enough. (If you program for the business, there&#x27;s plenty of &quot;other&quot; complexity that is O(n) or worse, and more infuriating than any technical challenge.)",1415797917

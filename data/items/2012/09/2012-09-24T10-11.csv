4564027,comment,4561973,4563755,2,0,lloeki,,,"This looks like a honestly interesting project, but the motivation wording has a few other nitpicks that ring a sort of alarm in my head.<p>> Performance
> Static typing can give you high, scalable and predictable efficiency, without the slow warm-up seen in many JIT compilers. These are important for interactive applications and games, for example.<p>static vs dynamic typing has not much to do with performance, at least as exposed here: the most widespread JIT out there is for a static language: Java, all the while both Python and Ruby can be compiled AOT (both to bytecode and to native code). Now type information could add some data for static analysis, which may bring some performance benefits but given how static typing is optional, such analysis (and following benefits) would only go so far.<p>> Compile-time and runtime type checking
> Static typing makes it easier to find bugs and with less debugging (and with less staring at long stack traces)<p>Well, for the breadth and depth of Java and C# stack traces I have enjoyed, they can be equally confusing, just as dynamic typing stack traces can be equally informative. More often than not, a confounding stack trace is a code smell of some architectural issue.<p>> Grow your programs from dynamic to static typing
> You can develop programs with dynamic types and only add static typing after your code has matured. This way you do not have maintain type declarations in initial development when the code is still changing rapidly.<p>This sounds interesting, but it also sounds like in reality, few areas would end up being typed and probably not enough for static typing to be meaningful. Humans are lazy, and programmers even more (that's why we tell machines to do stuff for us after all). I'm thinking a bit like for test suites, written after the fact or too late in the game. I guess that, just like tests, responsible developers will end up doing the right thing.<p>Maybe it's just the way it's worded and the project fundamentals are solid, but this <i>sounds</i> too much like a bullet list of ""why dynamic typing is bad"" (not that they're a silver bullet either) from someone who does not grok dynamic typing (and form the about page that does not seem to be the case, which only adds to my unease).<p>Anyway I'll keep mypy in my peripheral radar.",1348484336

Hopefully you'll still read my personal opinion about your venture and it helps.<p>I too have the problem you are talking about. I'm very interested in the people in places I visit and taking part is ""local activities"". I've used resources such as local mailing lists. reddit etc. to find interesting people and places to go to at my travels. I've had major success with that, for example I had the pleasure of going on a huge bike ride with someone from the NYC Reddit mailing list from Central Park to Kony island. I had a 12 hour connection and I don't think I could have spent those 12 hours better (I also visited relatives, so my schedule was super tight). This is still one of my best travel experiences.<p>I hope by now I've established I'm a perfect audience for your startup. I would love to have a few meetings with local startup people at places like Berlin for example. But I would feel VERY bad about the experience if I needed to pay money for it. I would love to reciprocate by giving someone a place to stay in Israel, paying for a drink or lunch (or both) or tweeting something good as long as I actually enjoyed it. But paying for it with cash upfront would make me feel like this isn't a genuine human experience and interaction, but more like bought time.<p>I'm not saying that is something everyone feels, it might just be me, but all I can offer you is my personal opinions and experiences.",1348483385

I predict (and of course I might be very wrong about this, I don't claim to know the future here) that with the current (over-)usage of 'share' thingies we'll see the same scenario. It starts off as reasonable (simple ads), becomes annoying/slows down the reading experience/hides content (sounds familiar?) and will be despised by more and more users until even people outside of my (and similar minded people's) influence find a solution on LifeHacker on how to avoid these things.<p>And frankly, that 'people getting used to them' argument seems weak.

4563940,comment,4562211,4563043,1,0,barrkel,,,"In my experience of web server apps, it's been fairly easy to guarantee that either the whole request succeeds, or - if there was an exception - every change is rolled back. Both user state and database state has been transactional, and state that lived on in memory in between requests was either read-only or caches.<p>In UI apps, it's much much harder to guarantee transactional semantics unless you're using persistent data structures or similar techniques that make in-memory transactions / undo trivial to make correct. So it makes more sense for exceptions there to save user data where possible, log the error (potentially back to the vendor), and restart the app.<p>(I don't want to talk about C++. I think both C++ exception handling and memory allocation are broken by C++'s design. You can only make it sort of work with coding standards, and even then it's labour intensive. If you don't yet understand why GC increases productivity, it's an epiphany you'll need to look forward to. Bonus: GC also makes exception safety far easier. For example, you can write a stack.pop() that returns the value popped - one of my favourite examples of C++ being broken.)",1348481542

4563938,comment,4562277,4562277,1,0,RobAley,,,"As the article somewhat alludes to, code isn't like a sequential book, but more like a conceptual system or a complex model. Rather than reading from top to bottom in a literal sense, the top you need to find to start with is the overview from 1000 feet (may the API or the design docs/specs), and you work your way down to the conceptual bottom or end of the story, which is way down in the implementation.<p>I'm not sure that the solution in the article achieves this in a coherent manor, and is only of relevance to one particular code repository (albeit a very popular one!), although it's never the less useful.<p>There is a class or two of tools that already exist and do help in this top to bottom process, doc generators and profilers (and sometimes debuggers). These work across all types of code repositories and all variations in quality of code. For instance, see the chap recently on HN who was trying to read and get to grips with a large code base [1] and my comments to him [2].<p>Granted these tools are versatile and go beyond just ""reading"" the code, perhaps there is some space for derived products which use these to create a ""story"" of the code from a top to bottom perspective.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4557919"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4557919</a>

4563937,comment,4562211,4562211,2,0,yason,,,"On the other hand, us who haved loved and embraced C don't mind this at all. It's up to us how to arrange the error handling.<p>Different situations warrant different strategies. Sometimes it's ok to return NULL, sometimes it's ok to return true/false and pass the actual result back indirectly, sometimes it's ok to return the value but use an external error flag. Sometimes it's ok to mix control flow and external flagging of errors, namely what an exception is, effectively.<p>However, in my opinion, languages who point too much to one single error handling mechanism are more irritating than languages that leave it up to the programmer. I'm particularly wary of exceptions per se: they're a really nice, clean concept but on the other hand I rarely hit an use case that would be a perfect hit for exceptions, and even those perfect cases for exception-handling wouldn't look too shabby if designed with other error handling strategies.<p>On the other hand, many cases where errors are handled with exceptions get awfully ugly in the normal case. For example, the ""try: ... except <name-of-error>: pass"" idiom in Python. I can't count the number of times I've written a small wrapper function around a trivial exception handling case, that just flattens the result and error into a suitable value if that fits my use case.",1348481426

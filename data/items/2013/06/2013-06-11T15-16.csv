Snowden did have a difficult time in HS and he does not possess a formal CS/technical education.&quot;<p>Having worked decades in the IT industry, my experience shows that formal education rarely makes a positive contribution to a person&#x27;s skills or credibility.

Snowdon could be captured and sent to some undisclosed location (or killed or your favorite theory, after all it isn&#x27;t like we expect to hear from him in the public), or an anonymous whistleblower could have been captured and sent to some undisclosed location (or killed or your favorite theory).

This call is being monitored&quot;.</i><p>4. <i>The post office would open your parcels and letters.</i><p>5. <i>There was book censorship on a massive scale.</i><p>Comparing the US today to drastic Soviet republics doesn&#x27;t really help the conversation - these far-off hypothetical comparisons make it easier for other people to dismiss your argument.",1370966375

We might not vote as much as we (arguably) should, but the shock and outrage on such a nearly universal scale illustrates that the government still doesn&#x27;t have absolute, corrupt power.<p>The fact that this was hidden and not designed as a deterrant also demonstrates to me that the United States is still, if not consciously, <i>afraid of the power of its people.</i> I can&#x27;t say that it will last indefinitely, but at the moment, I believe the people are doing a good job of showing that this is <i>not okay</i> and we aren&#x27;t moving towards people disappearing in the night and needing to be cleared for travel.",1370966327

The current situation is exactly what the term &quot;chilling effect&quot; was coined for. And the very fact that the risk is even considered plausible by normal, reasonable people demonstrates that there is a problem with the current situation.<p>This is actually bad news for elected representatives. Having an electorate who are apathetic about an issue is no problem for the politicians. Having an electorate who are vocal about an issue, but who are ultimately not going to do anything practical to back it up, is not much of a problem for the politicians. Having an electorate who are <i>deliberately trying to look apathetic</i> about a problem but who will in some cases change their vote because of it can put a politician out of a job, and because of the culture of silence they might not even see it coming.",1370966313

It pisses me off because a couple years back when everyone was grilling me about not wanting a facebook account and me mentioning all the privacy implications, their response was: &quot;oh, I have nothing to hide!&quot; but at the same time they didn&#x27;t feel like sharing with me their computer password.<p>Finally, in 2008 when I was looking to buy an apartment I had to pay the inflated price just like everyone else. It didn&#x27;t matter that I paid cash. Why was the price inflated? Well, because people didn&#x27;t bother to care much for the price of the apartment as long as they could get the loan from the bank. I had a friend that wanted to buy a house and all he could think about was what to do to be able to take the highest loan he could get. Never mind how he was going to pay for it later. Fast forward a couple years and now all those who bought apartments with the bank&#x27;s money are looking for my sympathy because it&#x27;s so hard for them to pay their mortgage and the bank might take their home.<p>I wish there was a country for people who cared.

5862438,comment,5861551,5861551,35,0,graycat,,,"Does sending letters to members of Congress
affect legislation significantly?<p>Definitely yes.<p>Example 1:  PIPA and SOPA.  Both
bills were about to pass; voters
got up on their hind legs against
the bills, and both bills went down
in flames.<p>Why?  Because most elections are decided
closer than 60-40.  So, for a person in
elected office to totally torque off
10% of his constituents is a good 
path to another job.  Even 5% of
constituents can be influential.
Actually, even 1% can be influential
because the member of Congress can
easily understand that if torque off
1% here, another 1% there, and have
that 1+% talking to others, the results can really
add up.<p>That&#x27;s why members of Congress are good
at smiling, kissing babies, shaking hands,
speaking in generalities with platitudes
and cliches, etc.:  Find ways to please
or sooth voters, ways that don&#x27;t torque off
even 1%.<p>Members of Congress are good at counting
votes and letters from constituents.
They can also count campaign dollars,
but dollars don&#x27;t actually vote, and
constituents can and, when motivated, do.<p>Not everyone in Congress really 
&#x27;gets it&#x27; on these points, but nearly
all members of Congress who have won
more than one election do.<p>For a little more, just think:  Take
just the Verizon data.  With that data,
can pick a Verizon customer and know 
where they were at each phone call.
So, really, can track their movements.
Also know who they they called.  So,
if there are any &#x27;secret romantic
connections&#x27; going on (and is there any doubt about that?), then have a good
shot at detecting some of them.  Presto:
Blackmail, shakedown, extortion,
recruit as an informer or a mole,
etc.  So, now a large fraction of all
the Verizon customers are torqued.
So, in any congressional district
or state with a lot of Verizon
customers, the relevant member of
Congress needs to be quite concerned.<p>Combine data such as that from Verizon
with IRS
data and actions, and have more
opportunities for blackmail,
shakedown.  Could throttle opposing
political efforts, not that anyone
in the Cincinnati office of the IRS
would ever actually try such a thing.<p>Gee, I omitted banking records!
So, some big shot is paying 
the condo fees for his mistress;
can see that in his financial records, 
especially if he bought a new BMW
for his mistress for over $10,000
(is there any other kind?).
Then combine that data with 
phone data and location data
and show that he was often in the
condo or calling the phone of
the mistress.  Now, have got the
guy; have him on a short leash.
So, back to the movie, &#x27;Godfather
II&#x27; where the Senator suddenly
became a really big supporter 
of the Corleone family.  It&#x27;s called
blackmail, and it&#x27;s one of the
oldest professions.  That Verizon
data is a wide open, engraved
invitation to massive blackmail.
Did Nixon ever consider using
IRS data?  Hmm ....<p>Really, that Verizon data is a wide open,
engraved invitation to a dirty 
dictatorship.<p>But Verizon could use that data for
such dirty stuff now?<p>Yes, and about the second time they
tried, the effort would become public
and their brand name would be dirt
and their business dead.  Also
Verizon doesn&#x27;t connect closely
with the IRS, FBI, INS, DHS,
etc. but the NSA can.<p>One of the best parts of the US
is our Constitution.  So, a big
part of protecting the US is
protecting the Constitution.
So, &#x27;protecting the US&#x27; while
trashing the Constitution is
destroying the US, not protecting
it.<p>Yes, maybe trashing the Constitution
would make it easier to catch
loser, wacko, nutjobs like the
Boston bombers, but:  (1) As we
know, the NSA, CIA, DHS, INS,
FBI, and the Boston police didn&#x27;t catch the Boston
loser, wacko, nutjobs even though
Russia had told us that they were
dangerous wackos.  (2) NSA did
trash the Constitution.  So,
the NSA is good at trashing the
Constitution but not so good at helping
catch loser, wacko, dangerous nutjobs,
even when given good hints that
they are dangerous nutjobs.<p>The job of the NSA, CIA, DHS, FBI,
INS, etc. is both (1) protect the
Constitution and (2) catch the bad
guys.  Both.  Trashing the Constitution
destroys much of the US and, thus,
necessarily cannot be part of
protecting the US.<p>Yes, yes, yes, we know:  The NSA
cooked up an excuse:<p>First they
just collect all that data,
e.g., all the Verizon data,
all the data through that AT&T
building in San Francisco, all
current Internet e-mail data,
etc.  So, their excuse is that
just collecting that data does
not hurt anyone because they
have yet to look at that data
or have yet to use that data to
look at any individual.  Or maybe
for the e-mail data they
look only at the header lines.
Sure that&#x27;s all they do!  Trust
them on that!<p>Second they argue that they only
look at that data for one individual
at a time given a good national
security reason to look at that
individual.  And then they only
use data that crossed a US
border.  Yup, Virginia, you
can be sure; you can trust
your Federal Government!<p>Third, they claim that, thus, their
actions don&#x27;t use data
that was only &#x27;domestic&#x27;,
don&#x27;t involve just any 
US citizens, and, thus, don&#x27;t
violate the
Constitution.  That is,
they have this huge box
of chocolates, but they
never open the box.<p>Right, that&#x27;s what they
claim.  And, right again, they would
never let that data, that they
are keeping essentially forever in Utah,
be used for anything else.
Right, and this car was driven
only by a little old lady
and only to church on Sundays,
and trust me on this.<p>To heck with the lame, contrived, tricky,
delicate excuses:  The NSA is not
supposed to be collecting data that is
only within the US and is not supposed to be
collecting data on ordinary US citizens
and certainly not on all or nearly
all US citizens.  Right, anyone
could use such an excuse:
&quot;I confess; I stole the book;
but that&#x27;s okay because I
haven&#x27;t yet read it!  And, yes,
that prime rib roast, I stole
that too, but that&#x27;s okay, too,
because I haven&#x27;t yet eaten it!&quot;.
So, the NSA trashed the Constitution.<p>The US government works for
us, the US citizens; we don&#x27;t work
for them; we are the ones to
be trusted, not them;
we are the ones presumed innocent 
until proven guilty, not them.<p>Their job is to protect us and
the Constitution, not to
monitor and control us and
trash the Constitution.<p>Yes, if we get the NSA, CIA,
DHS, FBI, INS, etc. back 
within the law and back to
respecting the Constitution,
then the next pressure cooker
that goes &quot;Boom&quot; in a crowded
place will raise the question
of, can we afford the Constitution?
The answer is simple:  (1) We need
the Constitution; trashing the
Constitution trashes much of our
country and, thus, necessarily
does not protect it.  (2) If we
have too many bad guys, then we need
better police work, not a weaker
Constitution.  (3) Police work
is not perfect, and our security
cannot be perfect.<p>For one more, the main issues in
US national security are not
loser, wacko, nutjobs with
backpacks with pressure cookers.
Indeed, now wackos hijacking
airplanes are no longer a main
issue in US national security.
Instead the main issues, for which
we need the NSA, CIA, FBI, etc.
are:  (1) Actions by nation
states, e.g., China hacking the
Internet in the US.  China 
stealing US military secrets.
Pakistan building more nuclear
weapons.  Iran going nuclear.  (2) Actions by
small groups, terrorists, e.g.,
Al Qaeda, toward a serious
WMD deployed in the US, e.g., a
nuclear fission explosion
in the hold of a ship in
a major US port.<p>At (1) and (2), we are pretty
good:  NSA&#x27;s SIGINT and the
CIA&#x27;s HUMINT, etc. can be quite
good well within the Constitution.
For nuclear fission devices, must
first get the materials, and that&#x27;s
still not so easy.  We&#x27;ve been
working hard for decades locking
down the materials.<p>We need to protect the US and
the Constitution, not try to protect
the US and trash the Constitution.<p>So, the Constitution is under attack,
and we have to push back and protect
and defend the Constitution.  Could
this be true?  Actually, not only true
but expected:<p>&quot;The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.&quot;",1370965339

If Edward Snowden betrayed his society, then surely his society betrayed him first. The ineptitude and callous disregard with which the nation state serves it&#x27;s constituents is the real crime here: No conspiracy, just incompetence. The banality of evil writ large.<p>Brooks claims that the bonds of society are weakening; that we are atomizing in an inexorable trend towards individualism. I refute this. The bonds of society are as strong as ever; but they are being reshaped and reforged in a manner that crosses geographical boundaries; that renders old allegiances obsolete and creates new societies; new movements, and new sources of power and influence.<p>Brooks may find it confusing and frightening; I find it exhilarating and liberating to live in such an age of change.<p>Edward Snowden; together with a great multitude of like-minded individuals are forging a new pact; a new power base. One built on a common culture of technological literacy coupled with socially progressive and economically libertarian views. We have no geographical focus, and our representation in traditional power structures is limited; but we are a real force for change, and the change is only just beginning.<p>The main slur that Brooks seeks to perpetuate seems to regard Snowden&#x27;s anti-social behavior, Putting aside the disgraceful Ad-Hominem attack for one moment, let me use myself as a counterexample: (Perhaps not the best, but the only one I have to hand) I have a wife and a family; I am gregarious and social; yet my affinity (and loyalty) to like-minded individuals half a world away transcends all of that. Like Snowden, I have had security clearances in the past. Unlike Snowden, I choose not to leak what I know, but I make my choice not out of loyalty to my family, my community or my country, nor out of fear of reprisal, but out of a dedication to professional ethics.<p>There are more, and greater things in this world than governments and nation states.",1370964075

The country is held together by government power, not a fabric of common consensus. Citizens don&#x27;t need to look after the common good. That&#x27;s the job of the authorities the author commends.

They hardly touched the design until recently and it is still clear that they didn&#x27;t want to piss the users off too much.",1370963245

Kind of like the TLS CA architecture; once you go and &quot;trust&quot; the root CA you would automatically trust requests that were signed by that CA.<p>Presumably they could ensure that their automated mediator limits the data collection only to things approved by the FISA warrant, in this case there would be no need to keep manually double-checking as the computer would do that for the company.<p>Likewise the automated system could continue to update the data in the &quot;drop box&quot;.

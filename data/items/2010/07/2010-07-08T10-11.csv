I explored a few years ago the opportunity to start a business there and it didn't take me long to realize that legal fees would eat up all my capital before I had even a chance to start writing a line of code. Moving your business there once it gains a bit of traction (and funding) is probably a better idea if that's what you want to achieve.<p>Now, legal issues are tricky everywhere. But one thing you need to think about is how labor intensive will your business be ? Some countries like France or Spain make it almost impossible to fire people whereas countries like Ireland or Switzerland offer much more flexibility.<p>But chances are high that you won't start by hiring a lot, right? Then, what you need to focus on is: how easy is it to grow a business and what would happen if you fail. You want to be able to add shareholder easily, while keeping administrative duties under control and you don't want to get into too much trouble if you need to file for bankruptcy. I heard Germany and the UK might be good choice if that's what you're looking for (not very sure though, please check ;)<p>Finally, if your startup will not be labor intensive, nor capital intensive at first, my advice is: don't overthink  legal aspects. Go where you have the best networking opportunities while being able to hire great people at best cost. And that might just be exactly where you're living now...<p>Oh, one last thing. Europe has everything you'll ever need in terms of talents and capital. So I don't agree when you say that you're ""less lucky to have been born in Europe"". But that's another story ;)",1278585919

That's why I said it was pretty limited. That may be true for security bugs in drivers. For a network driver that may even be very important. In practice what I see is that the actual bugs I care about in Linux drivers are code bugs that disable the device, or in a filesystem cause disk corruption. None of those are solved by a microkernel. Microkernels give you a bunch of provable advantages in areas that monolithic kernels don't seem to do too badly at.<p>>Why would there be added complexity? Linux has an api just as well but less defined than simple ipc - even more complex.<p>This is anything but simple IPC. You're sending async messages around and wanting to handle restart of whole pieces and reissuing of commands. It is much more complex and with many more edge cases that the equivalent Linux call stack.<p>>Hard to debug? you do understand that having parts of the kernel in userspace makes it easier to debug<p>Because now you're trying to restart a driver for a device that is in an unknown state and then restarting the operation of the filesystem accessing the driver that now has to make sure its operations are idempotent otherwise it will screw up. The number of new edge cases is immense. It could get hairy really fast. That is even touched upon in the presentation with the async messaging and deadlock avoidance. That's why it's harder to debug. Because you're adding a bunch of complex code in error handling paths that get executed once in a blue moon.<p>>Read LWN theres roughly a root exploit every 2 weeks<p>I read LWN every week, there are some local root exploits once in a while. The memory protection stuff could be good for that and you could implement it in Linux if you wanted. I specifically stated that part is interesting for this. My point is that the non-security bugs I care about wouldn't be prevented by this technique.",1278585703

New nodes automatically install and come online, and are as easy to remove. This eases management when you're dealing with hundreds or thousands of machines.<p>2. Permissions - we've got a much finer-grained permissions system which comes in useful if you're deploying a massive cloud for use across, for example, a multi-site and multi-department organization.<p>3. Self-healing - we've got a lot of monitoring stuff which watches running services and migrates them around the cloud as things (inevitably) break or become unavailable.<p>4. Layer 2 networking - we're providing virtual layer 2 networks amongst instances, which allows dynamic creation and re-organization.<p>5. Multi-tenancy - there's a full multi-customer, multi-user model in the system, which allows you to easily re-sell capacity.<p>6. Federation - using the same user and permission framework, you can pull up instances either in the local private cloud, other people's Nimbula clouds, or in public clouds like EC2 or Rackspace (or, I guess, even accessible Ubuntu clouds).<p>Basically, UEC is a good choice for running a local EC2 clone, but falls down a bit when you require very large clusters or strong security.

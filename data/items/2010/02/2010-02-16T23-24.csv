They believe in and value the right to private property, which means believing that it is right to let other people do what you don't like with their private property.  Add to that the belief that a personal business is private property, and you get the conclusion that no matter how much you personally dislike it, business owners ""should"" be allowed to discriminate.<p>By contrast if your belief in private property is not so absolute, then you're more willing to tolerate society restricting the free use of private property in ways that society does not like.<p>Different fundamental values leads to different conclusions.

Recent MS operating systems and browsers are more secure then older versions that are slowly being phased out, most users are using firewalls/anti-virus enhancements, and users are more aware of the fact that certain attachments/files are not safe to just blindly open.  On the Adobe side it seems like a decade of stuffing in useless bells and whistles to Acrobat to justify the size/budget of that group within Adobe is finally making the code too complex to properly vet and things that seemed like a good idea in the ""what features should we add to the next rev"" meetings are now looking like bad choices.

Otherwise I'd be latency limited :)<p>Being an IT Director I try to think of what I can't do without my local 1Gbps LAN. I'd say a big one is computer re-imaging. With that type of band you could build a good reference OS install and push it anywhere in the world that had a similar band.<p>I'd also turn this around and say ""how will the content providers deal with that kind of demand?"" Serving thousands of users at those speeds is a non-trivial task. The bandwidth demanded from the server is a multiple of the bandwidth increase to each client. If you solve this, your customers will have big money on the table. Rather than figure out the ""what"" will go over those links I'd figure out the ""how"".<p>With the current applications I'd say latency is a bigger issue. 100Mbs at <50ms is more useful than 1Gbps at ???ms. I don't buy the idea of ""dumb terminals"" AKA ""web OS"" without less latency. The biggest reason I use RDP, VNC, or Citrix is to trade a bandwidth issue for a latency issue, so why would more bandwidth == more terminal usage? If anything I'd expect the reverse.",1266364088

Yes, one can point to some countries that are doing considerably better on broadband on speed to some customers - specifically Japan, South Korea, and France.  After those three, speeds drop off a cliff (to the 10-20Mbps range).<p>And Not everything is perfect in those countries.  About 35% of Japan's broadband users are on lowly DSL.  And Japan, while having one of the most urban and tech-savvy populations out there, has <i>lower</i> broadband penetration than the United States.  That's right, a greater percentage of Americans have broadband than Japanese people.  France, despite its urban population, barely beats the US on broadband penetration and most of it is DSL!  A tiny fraction of it (a few percentage) is cable of fiber.<p>Part of the problem is how the OECD reports on broadband.  They report on advertised offers of service (and what speeds companies are advertising as their theoretical maximum).  US companies tend to create a uniform structure where they serve their urban areas in the same way they serve their suburban areas.<p>And it should be noted that the US is 7th in fiber connections and 15th of 30 in penetration all with one of the most subruban/rural populations.  So, saying that we're behind is factually wrong.  Saying that we're mediocre could be correct.<p>The US should improve.  It needs to improve.  However, the situation isn't as dire as many like to make it seem.  Many countries are getting in the 10-20Mbps range and the US is on the low end of that at 9-10Mbps.  It should improve.  It should be a priority.  However, it also needs to be noted that the situation isn't as rosy in other countries as people make it out to be and the US does have a more difficult challenge due to its suburban/rural population.<p>*All statistics come from the OECD broadband statistics.",1266363047

The average adult who argues that Pluto is a planet honestly just <i>wants</i> Pluto to be a planet, but he knows that's not a good argument and knows to manufacture another, more convincing argument in its place. He even convinces himself that his rationalization is really the reason why he thinks Pluto should be considered a planet. He lies to himself, in other words.<p>Kids aren't necessarily clever or knowledgeable enough to think that far. But kids can and do lie, and they're not always effective about it.",1266361648

I think websites as a whole suffer from information overload and the simpler something is the easier it is to use, which makes it accessible to everyone.<p>Second, the design. Its great, why not have favourites as icons? Every website now has a logo which marks their brand, we've become accustomed to viewing them everywhere so its easy enough to look at it and know exactly what it is. Its brilliant, visual and the kind of steps others should be taking in terms of UX.<p>Third, its on the web. Safari, firefox and chrome start pages are in your local browser, but we dont all use the same machine everyday do we? I switch between 2 or 3 as I'm at work, then at home or at a friends.<p>My only thought would be, I want to see more than 4 icons without ruining the visual. If you can achieve that then I'm sold.",1266361515

Some quick looking around online reveals that currently only ~29% of the US has broadband[2]. Not everyone needs broadband, etc etc. So this seems to actually be pushing for a sea change in the availability of internet connections in the US, and that, I think, is a much bigger deal than any sort of numeric metric.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=population+of+the+us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&#3...</a>

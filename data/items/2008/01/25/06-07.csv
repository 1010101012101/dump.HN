Sure, performance is better the other way -- but multiplying the functionality of each command comes at a price, namely that only grognards can do things ""the right way"". If we instead emphasized the way of distinctly separate commands for distinctly separate things...",1201243973

Pirates and ninjas can go to hell! What the hell is the point of a super wall?! I'm not your top friend? Throw your ugly pet rabbits into that pot, there are homeless kids to feed. No, I am not interested in you, I am straight thank you very much.<p>Yeah half those applications are ridiculous.

That should be illegal!""<p>Where I live the national limit on interest for Credit Cards is 16%, no ifs, no buts. If credit card companies benefit when people miss their payments they have an incentive to give credit cards to people who can't afford them. This, in turn, reduces the general level of prosperity in the country.<p>So, why do you think it -should- be legal for CC companies to raise the interest rates to absurd levels?",1201242565

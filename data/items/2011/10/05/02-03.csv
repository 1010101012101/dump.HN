I don't use the start menu for much other than quick access to programs that I don't want to clutter. The start menu is on the corner, and easy to click.

The thing that I keep thinking is with this being the first big announcement since Steve left the company they really needed to show the world that they where going to keep hitting home runs. While the 4S is an nice upgrade, it is in no way the home-run I would have expected to show that they are no worse for wear without Steve. I was very surprised when I learned that it would not be a 4G phone, that would have at least been an easy win for getting people to make the upgrade decision. My wife picked up an Atrix almost a year ago and it was 4G. I know the coverage is still growing and there are areas that do not have it, but it is not like 4G is not standard equipment on the higher end Android phones.

3073955,comment,3073269,3073269,4,0,CPlatypus,,,"I'm going to repeat what I said on Twitter when this first came up - dozba's computationally-intensive-task example doesn't really illustrate the problem.  Even if the computation is buried somewhere in a library, you can more or less predict when it's going to happen and make sure it happens in a separate thread/process.  The real hurt comes when your single-threaded server takes a page fault.  That's nowhere near so predictable or easily solved, and it still results in your entire application stalling.  Requests on other connections, which never needed to get anywhere near the page that caused the fault and which could have continued in a better design, will get caught in the stall.  That's just as true and just as lame as it was almost a decade when I (e.g. <a href=""http://pl.atyp.us/wordpress/?page_id=1277"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pl.atyp.us/wordpress/?page_id=1277</a>) and plenty of others were writing about exactly these issues.  Single-threaded servers are only appropriate for workloads where requests are trivially partitionable.  In other cases you can still use events and asynchrony but you should do it in a framework that is inherently multi-threaded to take advantage of multiple processors/cores.",1317783295

We should offer him our sympathy rather than enable his self-destructive behavior by praising his ""previous trolling"" activities.<p>This article, like the poor sad unfortunate Mr. Dziuba himself, seems to be combatting a strawman: the idea that Node.js users and developers are advocating that it be used for everything.  It's a fun platform to use, and pretty good for a lot of tasks, but any grownups close to the project (and there are a few of us) are quite vocal about the fact that it is targeted at a very specific use case: IO-bound network programs.<p>People get excited about the programs they use, and want to see how well it can do things.  When your hammer is fun to swing, you want to see what happens with you hit stuff with it.  Ted Dziuba has previously advocated using xargs instead of Hadoop for parallel map-reduce, so I would have thought he might understand that sometimes you use the tool that you understand (if it works) rather than something else, even if that other thing might be objectively better for that particular task.<p>I don't know what node users articles like this or Ted's are talking about.  I've been using node almost as long as Ryan, and totally love it.  I don't know how we could be more clear about what node is and isn't good for.<p>At NodeConf, in the Committer Panel, someone asked, ""What <i>isn't</i> node good for?""

Or those same services running on a resource constrained system with significantly lower traffic.<p>This is obviously a scenario where Node.js is infeasible (web based portions had to have C bindings for anything outside of presentation layer and all parts of the systems required significant profiling and optimizations to meet speed and resource usage requirements).  However, I've had several applications recently where Node.js could have been a possibility, but the documentation and overviews for it are either so beginner that you can't determine what it's capable of or is exploring areas where there isn't precedent for what it can do.  I couldn't find a straightforward list of supported features and the ideal use case for it.<p>After expecting a more detailed article covering ideal usage of Node.js, and that not being it, I figure I would finally break down and ask ""What is Node.js' ideal usage?  Under what scenario is it an ideal tool?""  It's not a knock against Node.js at all, maybe a slight one against the documentation, but not the technology or its use.",1317783066

It's a subtle point that most anti-copyright types miss.<p>And you're absolutely correct to observe that hard drives are material, and that the atoms they contain constitute the 'fixed medium' that provides the bright and shining line between ungovernable ideas, and the restricted world of copyright protection. But you're mistaken if you think you have any inviolable rights in your work. Copyright is a right in name only. In absolutely every other regard it's a privilege.<p>If you lived in France, things would be different. French jurisprudence includes ""le droit d'auteur"". That is to say, they recognize a moral right of the author to control the dissemination and development of his work by others. When the French say ""I have a right"" they're entirely correct.<p>Things are different in America, where lawmakers rejected that concept flatly. Regardless of the way you feel about it, Le droit d'auteur has never been recognized in this country, and at this point, it's safe to say it never will be.<p>So it's not that I 'believe' you have no rights. I KNOW you have no rights. Because you don't. What you have is a privilege that 's increasingly archaic, based - as it is - on a rapidly fading ability to produce more development than it retards in the ""Useful Arts & Sciences"". In case you didn't know, that's the Constitutional language giving Congress the power to issue the limited monopolies known as patents and copyrights in the first place.<p>In contrast with France, America (like England, which is the source of much American civil law) views copyright not as an exalted moral right, but as a necessary evil tolerable only to the extent that it clearly benefits society as a whole.<p>That's a big difference.<p>Wrap your head around the idea that you're defending a privilege - not a right - and I suspect that the whole tenor of your argument will change dramatically.",1317782723

3073926,comment,3070094,3073559,4,0,scarmig,,,"I don't mean to valorize the 1950's generally, at all. Yeah, white privilege was encoded into law, but if you were a member of the ruling elite, that actually benefited you. The point about gender you make is well-taken.<p>There are two separate issues: consumer goods and actual well being. I think you overestimate the difference in consumer goods between the ruling elite in the Fifties and the contemporary welfare underclass: the latter rarely, if ever, can take advantage of commercial air travel and have severely limited access to open-heart surgery. And barrier birth control and abortion were readily available (albeit significantly more expensive) to the rich in the 1950s, while in the modern day they (especially abortion) are somewhat difficult, though far from impossible, for the underclass to access.<p>But quibbling over those details can make us ignore the more central point. Access to consumer goods is only part of the picture, because power is a very strong and often superior substitute good for most of them. Roombas are accessible to the middle class today, but they are inferior to an actual person cleaning the house for you, even with an antiquated vacuum cleaner from midcentury. The vast majority of the population can text each other now, but a well-off member of management could very easily have a secretary do the same through a messenger boy. The latter is slower, but in some ways easier: he (invariably a he) had at will access to an intelligence superior to the most advanced AI now, without the burden of having to hit tiny keys, save phone numbers, or remember to charge his phone. A member of the upper class in the 1950's did not have to worry about employment; about housing; about having interesting work; about getting fired for drinking on the job (hell, your company would pay for your booze and cigarettes); about worrying how to pay the bills the next month; about sending your kids to a school with regular shootings; about visiting the social worker to prove you had sent out pro-forma applications to jobs you're incapable of performing so you can get your welfare check.<p>Some tradeoffs are less clear. The middle manager in 1955 had to worry about global thermonuclear war, but not about catastrophic climate change or poisoned soy sauce from China. We have hormonal birth control, but also HIV.<p>All of us are members of the professional upper middle class, so we're certainly better off. But an unemployed single parent living on the bad side of Hunter's Point? If I were forced to choose, yeah, I'd definitely go with the rich straight white guy in the 1950s with massive social privileges.

In the month, I got sick twice, had two 'best friends' get married, had a grandfather die, needed a root canal, wrecked my car (even though I chose to pay the max rent and live 5 miles from work, it told me I still <i>had</i> to to have a car), had my sink break (and the landlord refuse to fix it), got caught hiding pets in my apartment (why do I have a pet?  I can't afford a pet, that is just a bad decision.).<p>I get it, they are trying to make a point.  However, the point they are making is crap.  It is very hard to live on $9 an hour.  However, making $9 puts you in the top 1% of all humans who have ever lived.  There are lots of social programs that will help a little.  They don't make you rich, but they help a little.<p>The first thing I ask anyone who complains about being unemployed or underemployed: ""Do you have a TV?  Do you have cable or satellite tv?""  You wouldn't believe how hostile people are when you suggest that they might benefit from turning off their tv and using that time to study or learn a new skill.  As a child my family was on food stamps and welfare.  My mother raised 4 boys on her own.  As it turns out, I am now in the top 1% of wage earners in the US, but <i>I</i> don't have time to watch TV.  I have never taken a real vacation.  I suffered through 6 years of Army Reserve so I could pay for college.  Every free minute I have is spent working, hustling, studying, experimenting.<p>I don't believe the hype.  If you are willing to work your ass off, if you show up to work on time and aren't high or drunk, and you don't steal, it is very easy to get a job, today.  It's easy to get 2 jobs.  Working 80 hours per week isn't something that you want to do, but it's a walk in the park compared to the conditions our ancestors lived in.<p>It's really hard to take care of kids when you are a single parent and you can't get childcare, especially if you don't have family that is willing to help.  Maybe we should do more for people in this situation, not to help them, but to at least give the kids the opportunity to do better.  For everyone else, I say stop whining, throw away your tv, and stop being so entitled and lazy.",1317782005

There's a little extra bookkeeping in this example for the child process, but not much at all thanks to copy on write. If you were to do something dumb from the child work like memsetting a 1MB buffer to 1, I assume the child process would be far slower due to page faults.<p>There are certainly advantages and disadvantages to both threads and processes, but it's not really a fair comparison to claim that processes are as fast or faster than threads because you can spawn them at a certain rate.

Google+ on the other hand is a tertiary product.  Just because management realizes they need a foothold in social doesn't mean that they should forcibly try to transmute themselves into the target market.  Instead they should have people in charge of the product that care enough to use it naturally, and I think that's what they're doing.",1317780757

3073828,comment,3073463,3073654,3,0,kinghajj,,,"I don't know what you mean about ""many ways to declare... a function."" Unless you mean the fact that you can elide repeated types (""func foo(a int, b int)"" vs ""func foo(a, b int)""), which is just simple sugar to stop repeating yourself; or maybe you're referring to the named result parameters. Both of these are conveniences, and I wouldn't really say that they are different ""ways"" (syntactic constructs) to do something.<p>Variables in Go can be a bit tricky, but it's really not too difficult. In functions, declaring a variable with ""var"" requires a type and optionally and initializer. The "":="" construct declares and initializes a new variable whose type is inferred to be that of the righthand expression. Again it's just a convenience so you can stop repeating yourself.",1317780520
3073827,comment,3069746,3069746,1,0,profitbaron,,,"First of all as you are new to online business, I hope your numbers are more than just looking at screenshots & videos. You should actually have your own traffic statistics installed on the website to see if the stats add up as well as, verify the third party ads (if its a network then join that network and have the site let you run your ads on there for a while) although, this still can be faked via buying traffic & getting them to click ads so thats just a little warning/piece of advice for you.<p>With regards to monetizing the site, I would look at how the site is currently monetized. Why? Well in my opnion ads are one of the best indicator of monetization because, if they are converting well (for instance if the third party is a CPC network) then you could find a similar company/the same one and replace those adverts with CPA adverts - instead of getting paid per click you would get paid per action (generally via a purchase - although this tends to be much higher than CPC earnings - hence affiliates doing Adsense/Adwords Arbitrage etc).<p>Secondly, you could easily roll out a membership area (if the site doesn't have one) and offer paid memberships with certain upgrades. Theres loads of stuff you can do with the membership area to monetize your users.<p>This leads onto point 3, which if the site isn't already you should send a weekly/monthly newsletter to the members (if you implement a membership area) or to people who are subscribed to the mailing list (you don't even need a membership area to do this - just offer a newsletter on your site - which you can sell advertising in, as well as offering products to them again using CPA networks or your own suppliers).<p>Fourthly, you could roll out an iPhone/Android App (infact you could make a few ""parenting"" apps) and have them either as paid apps or free apps (which unless the apps provide real value added service, I would opt for the free app option which can be monetized via ads within the app although this isn't your only option).<p>Additionally, I saw that you said 80% of the traffic is from Google. This is a double-edged sword - you're willing to lie and die by Google - If one day Google decides to re-rank your site or changes its algorithms your site could easily lose 80% of its traffic overnight. In order to combat this, you need to diversify the traffic to the site as well as, at the same time you still need to take advantage of the traffic Google commands which means, quite simply adding more content, doing on-page seo and then focusing on off-page seo. However, if you are focusing on diversifying your traffic streams via link exchanges/content exchanges etc this will already be helping your off-page seo strategy (to some extent) so you can rank for more long-tail keywords, as well as increase the rankings of your current positions which means more traffic to the site.<p>With all things considered, you have a lot of potential advertising/monetization options and I haven't even touched most of the options you could implement but you should focus on growing the revenue streams as well as, diversifying your traffic stream so that your site will continue to grow and provide a nice return from your investment.",1317780501

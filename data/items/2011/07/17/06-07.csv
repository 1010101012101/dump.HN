I have around 6500 songs in my collection, about half of it rated, and all of it meticulously genred. Making playlists and picking something to listen to is really easy, as is downloading something new and incorporating it into my playlists.<p>Find a new reggae artist, rate his songs, and boom, next time I'm listening to good reggae, his songs pop up (but just the good ones).<p>Spotify makes all of my ratings and all my playlists useless.

Maybe 2 co-founders and 2-5 employees that work really well together. They're like a special ops team that can quickly maneuver around a problem.<p>They can probably do just fine with 12 months runway and a low burn rate. If they do figure out a repeatable/scalable business, they can raise a lot more money and grow it. If they don't, they can shut the company down.<p>The problem with Mahalo is that they skipped the first stage completely. Calacanis was ""hot"" and (like everyone) he thought his idea was a sure thing. He raised $20M because he could.<p>Even so, if he had created a small team and spent a year or two iterating it might have worked very well. With no pressure of running out of money it might have been harder to keep the the team focused, but it would have probably been fine. Hell, the company could have been breakeven off the <i>interest</i> of $20M.<p>Instead, they started scaling the business from day one and never really had that hard core team to perfect the processes, product, and business model. Even if he had wanted to, the VCs would have never let him keep the company to 5-10 people for the year or two it might have taken.<p>Due to the perverse incentives of raising that much money so early he's actually ""forced"" to make a bluff bet of the whole company rather than build it methodically.<p>The first bet was made by scaling the company before they figured out the business. The second is an even more extreme version of the first. After it fails there will not be a third.<p>tl;dr: Mahalo will fail because it raised too much money too early.",1310885255

It also suggests using AES in one paragraph and then later suggests making your own encryption function(!) shortly thereafter.<p>The only thing these techniques will get you is the difference between someone finding your static key with strings(1) and spending 5 minutes in IDA.

It doesn't seem like migrating to Pakistan from India worked out all that well for them.<p>There is no doubt that Muslims in India lag behind on developmental metrics, but I sincerely doubt this is due to any large-scale systematic discrimination against them. Sure, there is a fair bit of casual ""micro-discrimination"" against Muslims but that happens to a LOT of demographic groups in a huge and diverse country like India.<p>This might be an unpopular and politically incorrect view, but I believe that the thing that is holding back Indian Muslims and (perhaps Muslims elsewhere) is their religion. Believing that women shouldn't step out of the house alone, or that women should wear a burqa all the time or that several important formative years of a child's life should be spent studying the Quran or an insistence on studying Arabic and Urdu instead of the local language are IMHO not conducive to succeeding in a cut-throat capitalist economy. My unscientific survey of successful Muslims that I know leads me to believe that the most successful ones are not that religious.<p>However, the OP makes a good point that Hindu fundamentalism might be polarizing opinions in the country. Unfortunately, you can get away with being a Hindu fundamentalist in India, but being a Muslim fundamentalist mostly leads to career suicide.",1310883464

They are so successful I can't remember a single one of their domains.<p>2) Hooray, we learned the iframe tag in class today. Time to change the web!<p>In all seriousness, if it saves you time - congrats, you've nailed the first step in developing great products: create them for you, what you need. It's always fun to play around with these things and it may prove useful to you personally.<p>I would have rather spent the $6 on a pack of smokes than a domain for this though.",1210139803

183193,comment,182974,182974,0,0,jrockway,,,"Interesting that this came up today; I finally finished getting real backups going for my laptop's homedir.<p>Basically, I ended up using duplicity [1], which can back up to a mounted filesystem, WebDAV, ftp, ssh, or S3.  It handles encryption and incremental backups, and compresses everything on the backup medium (in encrypted 5M archives, with a seprate index file).  This is why I used it; davfs2 is very slow at creating files, and my homedir is mostly very small files.  I intially tried rdiff-backup, but it was just way too slow creating all those files.  Duplicity, however, is nice-n-fast; 1G of data compressed down to 85 5M files and the initial backup only took a half an hour (plus an hour or so for davfs2 to sync the data up to the server; damn slow DSL...).  The incremental backup is also quick, usually only a few megs of data transfer and it takes about a minute to run.<p>Anyway, I don't see much reason to pay someone else to do this for you.  Get duplicity, get an S3 account, and enjoy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://duplicity.nongnu.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://duplicity.nongnu.org/</a><p>Now it's time to rsync up my music collection.  I have 50G of storage to burn through, and the 200M full backup of my homedir just isn't doing it :)",1210138935

You have to be a lot better than any free competitor because people will choose a free alternative over a premium one if they're equal.<p>Beyond that, try to think of creative ways to market the site.

1532 Elm St.  Faketown, PL<p>Since PL is not a state, the postal service would know to look up the current address in this database, and would forward mail appropriately. They could then slap a label on it with the real address so that the postal carriers don't go crazy.",1210136925

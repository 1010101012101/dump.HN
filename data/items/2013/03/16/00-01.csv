They're usually 1-4 men with vests and pistol/shotgun.<p>When there's a known/probable gunman, it's prudent to take extra precautions - larger team, better armor, weapons that'll work if the criminal's wearing his own armor.

Chargebacks make services where money is transferred from one person to another extremely difficult to operate.

This is, in part, the recipe that leads everyone to hate PayPal.<p>In the BTC world, however, there is no risk to the service.

For Cloud SQL it's 1 year (it's in the Terms of Service), which means that you'd get at least a year's notice before it could be turned off. It's on par or slightly better than what I know of Amazon's policy (they have 1 year deprecation on their APIs and an undefined deprecation policy on their service offerings).<p>In my opnion having this deprecation policy would make Google Cloud SQL a lower risk proposition than a 'no-name startup', at least until the startup is in a position to  make similar guarantees (and the financial resources to stick to those guarantees).<p>Edit: I guess my point is that some Google products have service agreements as to how long they'll be maintained and so comparing consumer web services to Cloud SQL isn't really appropriate.",1363393598

I personally prefer a ribeye or filet over a new york or top.<p>My cooking style is right inline with dorianj (cast iron skillet + oven). I'd add that I like the steak to sit out at room temperature for 30-60 minutes and I pat it dry on the outside.<p>I'll put a small bit of butter or blue cheese on a filet while it's resting (rib eye doesn't need it).<p>Also, try dry aging your steak in the fridge.

5383743,comment,5382891,5383521,18,0,rayiner,,,"Obama has been more or less the right-center President he was as a candidate. People who are surprised by this wishfully read too much into his rhetoric.<p>E.g. Obama has continued interventions in Pakistan, etc, even though some people pinned their hopes on him as an ""anti-war"" candidate. But he was never ""anti-war."" He was ""anti-Iraq war."" He ran on a platform of ""Bush took us into Iraq instead of hitting the terrorists harder in Afghanistan."" So why should anyone be surprised he took troops out of Iraq and put more in Afghanistan?<p>E.g. re: drone strikes, is it really any worse than the cruise missiles Clinton was fond of using?<p>""Civil liberties"" in the abstract sense, are not a core issue to Obama's base in the same way that say abortion rights are. During Bush, Democrats opposed expansions such as military tribunals in Guantanamo, etc, but things like NSL's have been around since the 1970's. I don't think the bulk of Obama's base have a problem with the status quo circa 1995, or ever did, regardless of what adherent civil libertarians might have hoped.",1363392108

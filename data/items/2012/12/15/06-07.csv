Now couple the fact that there are so many deranged people and then give them a place to blabber away, the Internet, and you have a recipe for constant demagoguery and witch-burning.

They'd be bored without it (or they'd be stirring up drama with their friends or co-workers.)  They say they're angry, but they seem more excited and gleeful.  Some people love tracking hurricanes, some people love elections, and some people love tragedies.  It's a break from their boring lives, a dramatic and important occasion to share some excitement with millions of other people.  Like when Princess Diana died -- suddenly a lot of people realized that she was really, really, really important to them.  (Not that she wasn't important to a lot of people, but there were also plenty of people who were determined not to get left out of the excitement even though they only had a vague idea who she was.)  With Princess Diana it was grief, and with Ryan/Adam Lanza it's righteous anger.  People are just enjoying the hell out of it.",1355551504

I constantly encounter the same problems when I use other frameworks so I want everything to be fully flexible.<p>At the moment the REST routes are generated for resources and available through the api/resources endpoint. (For example, /api/resources/users/) you can however add whatever other routes you like to /api/ using your own controllers.<p>I'm thinking about adding a simple query language to the REST route syntax to take care of some common requests. That may work something like this: /api/resources/users/$near/lat,lon<p>It's still early stages though so I'll probably go through a lot of ideas before I'm happy with it!<p>It'll be called Nails (or Nails Framework, Nails CMS, whatever sounds closest to the finished idea) - I have the domain nails.io which I'll be using for this project.<p>Cheers!",1355551366

They do synchronization, and they're superb at it.<p>It seems to me that Dropbox is trying to change how customers perceive them and that managing photos is just the first step. Until recently, I think they've largely been viewed as a handy service to share files quickly between friends and across devices. There are a certainly a lot of exotic use cases for their product, and some other commenters have touched on specific ones, but the average person doesn't take advantage of them (or have them). If Dropbox can position itself as a base to store and share photos, videos, music, etc (notice the range of sharing options in the top right of the iPad in the blog post) they can give users peace of mind and easy access to content that is now strewn across several services and not carefully curated in other storage solutions.",1355551322

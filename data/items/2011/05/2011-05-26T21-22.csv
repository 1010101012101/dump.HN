It's a great tool when you're learning a language and want to see why the code you've written doesn't feel natural.<p>For me, it's also been useful for finding new languages.  Scrolling around, you occasionally see a language with a particularly clever or readable (or just quirky) solution, and you can bounce around the wiki to see what other examples in the language look like.<p><a href=""http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/</a> is also a great page for browsing languages.

2589573,comment,2589142,2589366,4,0,dctoedt,,,"> ""Legal weasels""<p>It's more nuanced than that, I think.  As Warren Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger (himself a co-founder of a major Los Angeles law firm) says, <i>always look for the incentives.</i><p>1. A root cause, ISTM, is that we lawyers are trained to regard ""zealous advocacy"" for the client's cause (read: desires) as one of our highest duties.<p>2.  True, we're also supposed to think of ourselves as officers of the court, and thus as gatekeepers. But look at how the incentives line up.<p>3.  Start with an executive who has a highly-developed sense of ""I want what I want, and I want it <i>right freaking now</i>."" And what this worthy wants is for those [expletives] to stop doing X.<p>4.  Add a lawyer who has strong financial- and reputational incentives to bring in work for him- or herself and for other lawyers in the firm. That's because:<p>4.1  Law firms tend to be dominated by rainmakers, not least because other law firms tend to court rainmakers who have big books of [portable] business. The national litigation firm Howrey LLP recently imploded because a few of its rainmakers were enticed to other firms, which started a run on the bank, because none of the other rainmakers wanted to be the last one out the door. See <a href=""http://goo.gl/Zh0Sz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/Zh0Sz</a> (NY Times).<p>4.2  Our lawyer also realizes that if s/he tells the executive, ""sorry, you can't make those [expletives] stop doing X,"" then the executive is very likely to go shopping for someone who is ""more of a team player.""  The lawyer's partners will then ask pointed questions about why the client went elsewhere.<p>4.3   Mix in the fact that when ""creative"" (read: aggressive) lawyering succeeds in ""breaking new ground,"" the lawyer reaps the admiration of his peers. In contrast, there's little downside for a lawyer to be aggressive -- rarely will a judge throw the book at a lawyer for being over-aggressive, because the rules are designed to accommodate ""zealous advocacy"" (see point 1 above).<p>5. Considering the above, it's no surprise that lawsuits can get ""creative"" in their assertions.",1306446868

2589559,comment,2586983,2588791,12,0,kds,,,"I'll give you a simple and real example that happened in Bulgaria that is not bound to any ideology or theory.<p>In 2004 the national state-owned telecommunication incumbent company was privatized for a sum which nearly exactly matched the net annual profit in the very same year. (~120 x 10^6 Eur net profit out of ~500 x 10^6 Eur gross revenues; we're not a very big country, btw).<p>So the actual effective acquiring cost was nothing - zero - for the buyers. There were public voices that said this was betrayal of the nation's interest but the then ruling party, full with 30-something MBA-suites from NY/London just babbled cheerfully in corporate-speak about the ""free market"", the ""right price"", and the ""right timing"" in the very same pointless way so much detested here in HN when it's about examples of corporate stupidity.<p>A curious thing - the former chief economist of the World Bank,and Nobel prize winner, Joseph Stiglitz was a star-guest in a popular TV talk show and advised not sell at all at the moment (when was asked to comment on the matter, I happened to watch the show). He wasn't listened to, eventually.<p>But the MBA-boys in a way weren't stupid at all - after around short 3 years the company was resold for ~1.1 x 10^9 Eur. Nothing that much changed, neither was invested in the company that really made some <i>real</i> difference in the market share or company's gross revenues. The deal was formally fully observing the legal regulations - there was nothing that could be pointed out as strictly illegal.<p>In the political aftermath this party was voted out of the parliament into oblivion by the people. But those guys just don't seem to care anymore for the political life - they've ""made"" the bucks... foreign companies, investors, and top world investment bank consultancies were instrumental in the whole exercise.<p>No doubt for me, similar scenarios on various scale have happened throughout the whole former Soviet block of countries.<p>If this is theft and corruption - foreign western players milked also  greatly from it (even if not the most of it).",1306446475

2589557,comment,2587617,2587890,1,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"Your view is not a simple string template in Lift.  In most frameworks, you handle the controller first, gather all your data and pass it to a string template.  In Lift, the View is parsed and then all (there are frequently many) of the required ""controllers"" are invoked to fulfill the view.  This is somewhat, kind-of, almost like custom tags in JSP, but about a thousand times keener, because it is all parallelized and so forth.   Because of this, Lift can do things like trivially bind html to changing Actors (in the erlang sense) so that when the Actor changes, the html changes in all the browsers that viewed it.<p>Supporting this all is non-trivial.  ""Persistence"" usually boils down to serialize, deserialize and transactions... which are ultimately not unique to Lift, so I don't see a <i>huge</i> need to focus on it.",1306446430

You get an ip, and standard headers, and the request made. thats it. you can't query things like screen resolution, browser capabilities, what version of flash you need to target at minimum. you also lose flexibility. you need to be forwarding logs on to a central processor, or even have access to your logs in the first place, which many people do not.<p>Imagine some schmuck who adds a plugin to wordpress who gets fined, even though he doesnt know what a cookie is, because the plugin stores it's state in a cookie (think tabs and what not) these arnt strictly necessary to the operation of the site, so it's a fine for him.<p>Which bring me to another question, how the hell can they even enforce this? you can't really automate it. there will be too much variation in consent popups and in page elements, and who even knows what solutions.

</code></pre>
The assembly after 'BINARY_OP(...)' is the integer add code. pCurEvalStack points to the top of the current evaluation stack. Binary ops are performed on the top two items on the stack, and pushing the result back onto the stack.<p>The assembly after 'GO_NEXT()' is the standard epilogue, which just dispatches the next instruction (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_code#Direct_threading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_code#Direct_threading</a> for description of direct-threading).<p>There are 3 seperate loads of the same memory address, which surely can be done better.<p>I'll probably have a go at altering the definition of the BINARY_OP(...) macro to see if I can persuade it to generate better code. I'm not keen to hand-write the assembly for this as it can compile to multiple processors.<p>The macro is currently defined as:<p><pre><code>  #define BINARY_OP(returnType, type1, type2, op) \
  	pCurEvalStack -= sizeof(type1) + sizeof(type2) - sizeof(returnType); \
  	*(returnType*)(pCurEvalStack - sizeof(returnType)) = \
  	*(type1*)(pCurEvalStack - sizeof(returnType)) op \
  	*(type2*)(pCurEvalStack - sizeof(returnType) + sizeof(type1))
</code></pre>
...which can probably be improved, or at least specialised to give better results for binary ops where the operand and result types are all the same - e.g. integer addition.",1306443853

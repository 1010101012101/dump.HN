4755159,comment,4754234,4754892,1,0,jasonshen,,,"I think part of the problem is that especially with decisions of the heart, people make short sighted choices. For example, people who marry young (sub 20) should realize they probably don't have enough information to make that choice. They may not regret their decision later (cognitive dissonance) but they probably could have better optimized.<p>If this doesn't convince you, at least consider the fact that doing this exercise will allow you to be more sure of your ""gut"" decision should they align and be a tad more wary of it should they disagree.",1352321950

4755155,comment,4753220,4754213,1,0,_delirium,,,"Ah interesting, I wasn't aware of that. Doing some googling it seems to be a thing specific to bio and related areas, related to how NIH funding is differently structured from NSF funding. The NSF doesn't really have the equivalent of these training grants, but is more structured around 3-year projects, so students are hired onto specific projects as research assistants, or TA in years when no project money is available. Project budgets always include requests for money to support grad students, so the NSF indirectly funds a lot of training, but it's routed through the PIs proposing projects, rather than allocated at the school or department level. There's also quite a bit of DARPA funding, which is even more project-driven.",1352321896

I know someone just cringed at that thought, but the idea centralizes around improving user experience on the website.<p>First, all normal precautions would be taken (no common digit patterns - 1234, 1111, 2222, etc). There would also be a limit of two attempts before the passcode is reset. The reset procedure would be them receiving a new passcode via SMS, and them having to reply ""yes"" before the account is unblocked. The passcode is also reset every month, and a new one is sent via SMS to your phone (you can reply to change the passcode to something else).<p>Now for the issues I would need to address before this is even a possibility:<p>1) Users on the website login with their phone number, so one obvious attack would be someone cycling through all possible phone numbers with the same passcode (for example 8237). One suggestion in the article was detecting average error rates and comparing them to see if the entire website login should be throttled.<p>2) If someone somehow gets a hold of the database, all passcodes would be easily crackable. Now usually this would be a huge issue, but this is because normally people could use the email/password combination to login to other websites the user might use. Since they're using 4 digit passcodes, this wouldn't apply.<p>3) Someone could write a script to try phone number/passcode combinations until the entire website has their passcode reset, but this would fall under 1) where the error rates would exceed the normal limits and the logins would be throttled.<p>4) What would be an appropriate way to throttle? I mentioned it twice above, and in the article it was referring to a timeout, but the user experience of this would negate all benefits of a 4 digit passcode. Someone could keep trying combinations, and keep throttling the site every day. I could block the ip's, but what if those ip's were also sources of legitimate traffic and stopping users from logging in/signing up.<p>Thoughts?",1352319218

In reality, it results in anarchy, for a brief moment before one strongman clubs another over the head, and two other people decide to team up against their neighbors.<p>Even casting aside the concept of civilization as we know it, you cannot reproduce in a vacuum, nor live in one. You are beholden to others for your existence, and you repay this debt by helping to ensure the continuation of the species. A morality that prizes collective rights over the rights of the individual is fundamental to our biology. Sovereignty, therefore is not a function of individuals.<p>Lest I be decried as an opposite but equal ideologue, I do see a necessary role for the individualists. The forces of society and government are powerful, and must be resisted: what is bad for one individual is just as likely to be bad for the whole of society. Neither side should ever presume an absolute right: in this battle there is no victory.<p>You also err in your definition of government. You were nearly correct: government is a natural monopoly on the use of force. The 'competitive market' for government is commonly called warfare. Government is a necessary evil as long as men are capable of violence.",1352318757

Dollars, Euros, Yen, and gold are all commonly used for current-day international transactions (with a strong preference generally for US dollars, though this may change).  The dollar also has special standing as the preferred reserve currency, but again, this is largely a matter of convention, liquidity, and stability.<p>Over historical time, there have been (usually local and smaller-scale, though not always) systems in which multiple currencies managed by multiple sovereigns circulated and were commonly used.

Let me quickly explain.<p>Traditional film production uses 24fps with a 180 shutter: a film frame gets exposed for half of 1/24th of a second, and then during the other half of that 1/24th of a second, nothing is exposed. We learned to associate the motion artifacts produced that way as looking ""film-like"".<p>With digital camera, you can easily crank that up to a 360 shutter: each frame gets exposed for a full 1/24th of a second. Some films used 24fps 360 for selected scenes, and people immediately said that it looked ""like TV"". A fair response, since TV always had similar motion artifacts.<p>Now when PJ moved to a higher frame rate, he could have said ""let's make sure we get a 180 degree shutter look for both 24fps and 48fps by filming at 96fps, then for every 4 frames, combining frames 1+2 to get traditional 24fps 180 footage, and using frames 1+3 to get a comfortable 24fps 180 (frame 4 would get thrown away in the process). PJ mainly uses Red Epic cameras that go up to 120fps, so this would have been no problem.<p>Instead, PJ went with filming at 48fps and a 360 shutter. This resulted in normal looking 24fps 180 footage, and very TV-like looking 48fps 360 footage for those cinemas that support 48fps. For me, this whole mess is just an unfortunate lack of good testing in pre-production.<p>Let's hope that James Cameron recognizes these issues and shows everybody how it's done properly by using the 96fps solution while filming Avatar 2.",1352318437

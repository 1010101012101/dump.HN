6819390,comment,6817614,6818738,6,0,onetwofiveten,,,"Your obvious answer follows from a specious argument. You assert the notion of &quot;property&quot; as if it were a clear and well understood absolute. However, that is far from the truth.<p>For example, almost all land has been taken by force at some point in its history. I own a house, but the land it was built on is almost certainly stolen property (by your &quot;obvious&quot; notions of property).<p>For another example, when I get paid, some of that money gets paid as taxes. That&#x27;s not something I agreed on, by your ideals, I should be able to opt out. But, my property only exists because of the work of the government to protect it, and that work came with an implicit reciprocal agreement that it would remain as part of my country. The land I own is, in a sense, also owned by my country. By removing my land from my country I would be breaking the implicit agreements formed when it was first entered into the land registry. The same goes for other things besides land, in particular, the companies I work for are registered and protected by my country. Corporations are abstract concepts, they can only exist by being built on a complex shared legal framework. Again, if you own or want to start a company you might want to opt out, but everything that got you to the stage of being able to opt out is built on implicit social agreements between you and your nation.<p>When I earn money, I do not create value in a vacuum. Everything I do relies on the wider society. I&#x27;m not just talking about the obvious things like roads and the police. Social structure itself is vital to enable my ability to earn money. I thrive because I live in a relatively peaceful society with a shared language I can communicate in, with shared cultural norms that make life comfortable. Those things are shared property, belonging to society a whole, for which we all owe a debt and a reward.<p>The very notion of money itself is a social construct. The faces on your money belong to your government leaders. Money only has value because we all agree that it has value. Otherwise it is just a high score in a very boring game. In a sense, all money belongs to all of society. Everyone owes a debt to everyone else for the simple fact that we don&#x27;t have to barter. You might think this sounds ridiculous, but this idea of ownership exists and is prevalent. Governments print and destroy money, they manage circulation, they control inflation. In a general sense, the currency belongs to the government. In an even deeper sense, a large part of what people spend their money on is related to social structure. People buy material things for the social status imbued in them and they consume entertainment that relies on a shared cultural understanding. Every movie you watch has been informed by hundreds of years of theatrical and cinematic progress that is owned by no-one and everyone.<p>You can&#x27;t have an absolute fair notion of property. It doesn&#x27;t exist. Every piece of land has been stolen at least once. Everything else was created through some level of coercion. The distribution of wealth has never been fair. It wasn&#x27;t fair when I was born, and so the requirement for me to earn a living (because I was not born rich) is an unfair coercion. Also, it wouldn&#x27;t even be possible to be fair if we started fresh on a new planet. Absolute fairness requires isolation from all implicit social contracts, which is impossible for humans to do.<p>Most importantly, absolute fairness based around the single ideal that no-one can take someone else&#x27;s property would be an awful and inhumane way to run a society. The people who have more property then others have a way of convincing themselves that they deserve it. Which is an argument that can be used to justify all manner of horrors. On the other hand, if we put aside ideals and look at what practically makes a better society, under any reasonable set of measures, reducing income disparity is a good thing.<p>Society is a set of implicit and explicit rules that form a game. Money and status are like scores of the game. If wealth accumulates too much in one person, that does not mean that this person deserves to live like a king while others needlessly starve. It means the rules of the game are exploitable and need to be adjusted. Not everyone is a master strategist, not everyone has the abilities to get rich. In the future, most people won&#x27;t even be able to get a job. Those people don&#x27;t deserve to suffer just for being normal humans. The people who can do useful work (and I include myself in here) don&#x27;t especially deserve to be saved from suffering just by virtue of having been born with unusual skills.<p>Society can easily reward those who work hard and have valuable skills to contribute. These people can be made very comfortable. Society can also look after those people who do not have the skills to become wealthy, who are not suitable for positions of power. There is enough to go round. There will be even more in the future. It&#x27;s possible for us to have a peaceful, low-crime, happy, healthy society where those who earn a lot have to put up with sharing some of it as the cost to them for living in such a great country. Or, we can ruin ourselves over an impractical ideal of property that, at root, is like a child clinging to a toy and shouting &quot;mine&quot;.",1385733524

6819359,comment,6818371,6819309,15,0,tikhonj,,,"No, because Haskell&#x27;s type system (ignoring certain relatively experimental extensions) is actually quite simple. Many people may find it difficult to learn, but only because it is so different and alien and not because it&#x27;s some baroque monstrosity.<p>In some ways, Haskell&#x27;s type system is actually simpler than Go&#x27;s: there&#x27;s no sub-typing and hence no real casting. Haskell also tends to eschew special cases in favor of more general solutions; for example, Haskell does not need any magical notion of multiple return values built into the language because this is naturally subsumed by tuples. Similarly, Haskell has generics instead of baking a paltry set of data structures into the language.<p>Also, algebraic data types are actually very natural. Tagged unions (also known as variants or sum types), unlike normal union types, are dual to product types (structs and tuples). This means they are actually just opposite versions of the same underlying structure: very symmetric. And just like in physics, symmetry usually means you&#x27;re onto something.<p>Haskell has an extremely simple and elegant core; just because it&#x27;s difficult to learn for some people does not mean it&#x27;s a particularly complex language. It&#x27;s certainly simpler than Scala, for example! Certain extensions add quite a bit of complexity, but the most complex ones are not super-widely used so you can reasonably get away without ever dealing with them.",1385732971

It&#x27;s a python graphical framework making heavy use of opengl via an optimised cython interface. It has fairly powerful access to the android api through pyjnius (which gives direct access to java classes) or pyobjus on ios (which is less mature but has the same idea).<p>On the plus side, since it&#x27;s native to the device (albeit with a different interface), you can do pretty well for speed through the already optimised graphical interface and through optimising your own apps with cython or even C modules if necessary. Other pros include pyjnius/pyobjus for api integration as above (some of which is already abstracted as python modules), and neat perks like the ability to mostly develop on desktop without an emulator.<p>On the other hand, it has some of the same disadvantages as html5, such as non-native widgets.

Whatever I do, I always eventually need it as program gets specialized, and always be frustrated on non-native platforms. Usually cross platform stuffs lack this or needlessly painful even they offer it. Also you still have to write platform specific code even they support it. (2) Freedom of development. From native, it&#x27;s relatively easier to build up HTML5 stuffs on top of it. (or whatever…) So I still can utilize HTML5 stuff if I really need it. Reverse is mostly impossible. (3) (Though that&#x27;s arguable, <i>what&#x27;s native?</i>…) Compatibility. Native development on C/C++ level always offer best compatibility. There&#x27;s no computing platform doesn&#x27;t support C/C++. Emscripten extended this even to HTML5. HTML stuffs are available only on browsers and a few specialized platforms. (4) Legacy. I always discover a mostly ideal implementation exists on native platform where HTML5 people are making efforts to bring. This includes better toolset for code writing and debugging. (5) Future. (I imply HTML5 == markup+CSS+JS). No serious major browser vendor really loves HTLM5. Because that limits their platform features. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re adding WebGL and C/C++ support or whatever non-HTML stuffs from native world.",1385732086

A native app just feels right, where a HTML5 only app won&#x27;t give you the best user experience you can get, no matter how much time you put into it. If you need a flexible, big, cross-platform app without a lot of budget to build at least 2 native apps a HTML5 app with wrapper would be a decent option, but for anything else (especially the more simple apps with just 2 or 3 different views) you should go with native.",1385730777

Fully fueled for liftoff, the Saturn V weighed 2.8 million kilograms (6.2 million pounds), the weight of about 400 elephants. The rocket generated 34.5 million newtons (7.6 million pounds) of thrust at launch, creating more power than 85 Hoover Dams. A car that gets 48 kilometers (30 miles) to the gallon could drive around the world around 800 times with the amount of fuel the Saturn V used for a lunar landing mission. It could launch about 118,000 kilograms (130 tons) into Earth orbit. That&#x27;s about as much weight as 10 school buses. The Saturn V could launch about 43,500 kilograms (50 tons) to the moon.

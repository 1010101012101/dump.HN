In the git history it's eventually going to be troublesome to unearth, unless the change remains intact enough for ""git blame"" to give you a pointer to that old commit, or your whole team standardizes keywords for more searchable commit messages. And if your team does have a way to find that explanation, you then need some way for them to discover whether it has become inaccurate over time.",1322431188
3283539,comment,3282697,3282697,3,0,harigov,,,"I think, Google has been playing rather well. For so long, it was more of a loosely connected free services rather than a single ecosystem that seamlessly work together. There was nothing, for the most parts, preventing any person from moving to a different third-party service [of all the services that Google offers] rather than using Google's services. I don't think Google bothered for so long because it had no reason to. Whether people use Google's services or any other services, Google will make money either way using adsense and adwords. Now the situation is changing, and changing very fast.<p>Google+ is not just about another social network, I believe it will be the soul of all the services that Google offers. Most of the services that Google offers worked pretty much independently. Except the Google logo at some corner of the site, there was n't much of a similarity in any of those services. The result is a mess. Google+ unifies all these services like never before. Social networking comes much later, I believe. Google is at an advantage over other companies, if it plays well. Facebook/twitter can let users share with their friends. Google can let users share, work and collaborate with their friends. Sharing in every form conceivable - sms, voice, image, blog, book, document, presentation, video, music, app, you-name-it.<p>Now for the problems that it faces, the biggest problem was with the platform that they were betting on. For long, Google's motto was - anything good for internet is good for google. That's no longer the case, and it won't be going forward. They were pretty successful for the most parts because they bet on open platform, and the reason for present crisis also seems to be because of the same. Google is no longer the internet [they never were but don't take it literally], and not everything that happens on internet benefits google. Facebook has an advantage here given all the businesses that they have signed up to use FB OpenGraph. However, they still have their own issues. If Google acts smart, Google+ has pretty good chance of being successful.",1322431168

I've never in my life been into specific diets, and have been very skeptical about crazy sounding ones like Atkins, but I'm sold on Paleo.<p>The underlying reasoning makes sense to me - homo sapiens have existed for the 200,000 years (and our various ancestors for millions of years before that), and for the first 190,000 years we lived on and evolved with hunter-gather diets.<p>It wasn't until 10,000 years ago that agriculture was invented and our nutritional intake, lifestyle, culture, economics, and everything else changed with it.  But physiologically we haven't fully overcome millions of years of adaptation to the hunter-gatherer diet.<p>Paleo is about constraining your diet to something as close to the hunter-gatherer diet as possible - no processed sugars or grains, but rather meat/fish/poultry, nuts, berries, roots, vegetables that don't require agriculture to obtain, some fruits, etc.<p>A few benefits off the top of my head - I'm less hungry, more satisfied, and have more sustained energy throughout the day, with less food.  I feel 'cleaner' and healthier, and have almost no gas (the biggest revelation).  And I've never had a terribly unhealthy junkfood diet, but Paleo is still a noticeable improvement.<p>You can also cheat and go 70%-80% Paleo, instead of strictly 100%, and still derive some benefits (enough to sell you on it), although 100% Paleo is exponentially better.<p>There's also no crazy initiation period like there is with Atkins and South Beach, you just go read a book about what constitutes Paleo food, and start integrating it into your diet and replacing non-paleo foods at your own pace.<p>I highly recommend checking it out:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet</a><p><a href=""http://www.marksdailyapple.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marksdailyapple.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.arthurdevany.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arthurdevany.com/</a><p><a href=""http://reddit.com/r/paleo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/r/paleo</a>",1322430027

There are times we must put in a 16 hour day but constantly killing yourself over work hurts you in the long run. The more punishment you dole out to yourself the less productive you are and the longer you have to work to catch up.<p>A lot of whining would cease if people stopped trying to keep up with the other guy for the sale of keeping up. Become what you're meant to become and fuck expectations and what other people are doing. Grow to the size you need to be. Too many startups start taking money too soon and are run as if they're a huge company when all they need is a single server and a guy to write code. Premature scaling can probably account for a large portion of the whining <i>and</i> failure out there.<p>I see way too many startups trying to be something they're not and shouldn't be which leads to burn out and failure.

Don't work hard, work smart - which means working long hours and pushing a deadline when needed. It also means being skeptical and ruthless with your business model, validating your ideas and pivoting when needed.<p>> Cry less<p>No. Cry more. Vent and complain. Give yourself emotional release. Your brain needs it. And how can you code optimally or run a company properly when your brain is working at partial capacity?<p>If you are smiling, happy and confident all the time when building a startup you are probably a deluded idiot. That being said - always exude confidence to your customers and strategic business partnerships. (insert witty remark here about sausage being made) However ALWAYS be brutally honest with yourself and your team. If you are honestly challenging and validating your idea and business model you will lose faith from time to time and may even slip into a funk. THIS IS NORMAL. If you're honest with your team they will find a way to help you through.<p>> And realize youre part of history.<p>This is true in the sense that you are living and breathing and working during the early 21st century - you are a part of history (by this definition every dog is also a part a history, so don't get too excited). But it's highly unlikely that you will <i>make</i> history. Like most people (and most dogs) your startup will toil and die in obscurity. It's absurd to concern yourself with your legacy before you've built something of value. Build a great company and let history make up it's own mind.",1322428290

It used to be that a company could build something like Google and sit on its laurels for 20 years. IBM was the undisputed king for at least 50 years, and Microsoft was king for about 20.<p>The problem is not other search engines, but disruptive innovation that makes search engines obsolete. And this disruptive innovation seems to decrease its cycle time by about 50% each generation.

Money was has had a tradition of being valuable in its own right (gold and silver coin), and eventually banks created paper money that represented an amount of gold held in reserve.<p>The Bank of England, was at first a private entity (established in 1688) and was only nationalized in 1946[1].  The notes they issued were backed by deposits of coin, gold, or silver.  They broke with the gold standard in 1931, and it's then we see money tied not to a specific asset, but rather as a debt instrument; it's valuable only because someone promises to pay you back.<p>When the debtor is a nation-state, we have fiat money, and the money is backed only by the faith and credit of the nation who issues it.<p>As Weatherford's book points out, fiat currency was not invented by the British, as the Chinese were using a similar system in the 1st or 2nd century, and continued to use a paper money system until 1399.  Abuses destroyed the value of the paper currency, and it did not reappear in China until the 20th century.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England</a>",1322427991

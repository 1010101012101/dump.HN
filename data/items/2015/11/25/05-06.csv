The two female characters shared the same room.<p>The Odd Couple (1970–1975) had two non-related men in the same apartment. It was based on the 1965 play.<p>I don&#x27;t know shows of the 1950s to know if any of them had roommates, vs. a generation later.<p>> Fifty years ago a person would typically go straight from living with his or her family to living with a spouse<p>My knowledge of mid-20th century series isn&#x27;t that good, but I think this reflects a different cultural shift. That is, boarding houses used to be a common thing, not roommates. See <a href=""https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=roommate%2Cboarding+house&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Croommate%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cboarding%20house%3B%2Cc0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=roommate%2Cboa...</a> for an ngram comparison.<p>Sherlock Holmes and Watson shared an apartment.

Perhaps like how &quot;condo&quot; would have been a peculiar term to our 1950s viewer, where there is little social difference between condo and apartment living even though there is an important legal difference.<p>I suspect it&#x27;s the 1950s which is the odd decade, with its new zoning laws restricting boarding houses, combined with the post-war economic boom. A 1930s viewer - or I should say &quot;listener&quot; -  may find it less peculiar.",1448431116

A lot of browsers re-used IE 6&#x27;s rendering engine because it had a monopoly. That only made the situation worse.<p>A browser&#x27;s rendering engine is the ONLY part that matters, and if anyone has a monopoly that is &quot;bad&quot; because competition helps innovation.<p>Each rendering engine winds up, for good and bad, with a small group of people deciding what features do and do not get put in. If they simply decide that feature Y doesn&#x27;t get put in, and that rendering engine has a monopoly then feature Y is a non-entity as far as the web is concerned.<p>For example, if Google controlled the web&#x27;s primary rendering engine do you think Do Not Track would be in it? NO! It took all of their major competition to add it before they did, starting with IE.",1448431051

In most contexts that is informally &quot;the most recent write&quot; in terms of wall clock time (i.e. sequential consistency).<p>In C++, C and Java, this is not necessarily how things are.

If a PC manufacturer&#x27;s choice is between not selling PCs with Windows pre-installed and having to pay a per-PC license for Windows whether Windows is installed or not, then effectively it&#x27;s forced. And this was likely in play for years, but covered by commercial in confidence.<p>> DR screwed up massively by refusing to sign a deal with IBM<p>Sure but that&#x27;s a different issue entirely.<p>As a result of the litigation over 86-DOS/QDOS (which MS licensed from Seattle Computer Products) Seattle Computer Products, DR-DOS, IBM, and Microsoft ended up with the right to ship DOS. Microsoft acquired SCP&#x27;s license for chump change via a dubious legal maneuver whereby it was forced to sell its license to MS rather than to anyone else for whatever they wanted to pay (I forget the detail, it&#x27;s documented in one of the Gates biographies). DR and IBM continued to sell technically superior versions of DOS, but IBM&#x27;s was bundled with IBM-branded hardware and DR was crippled by Microsoft&#x27;s licensing contracts which became particularly effective once Windows 3.x came out.<p>> 21+ years is a bit of long time to hold a grudge<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg of things MS&#x27;s anti-competitive behaviors. Probably its most pernicious behavior was &quot;dumping&quot; on rivals (cross-subsidizing products such as Access until rivals went out of business) and actively sabotaging third party software (e.g. -- allegedly -- deliberately breaking Lotus 1-2-3 on DOS 2.x and -- well-documented -- breaking Borland compilers in the Windows 95 betas (which might well have continued into the release version had it not been caught red-handed).",1448430862

They sports fairly hard.[3]<p>Bleecher Report is not to be out sportsed, sort of a hipster pitchfork media type sports player.[4]<p>CBS Sports[5]<p>NBC SPorts[6] This, and the preceding offering are large entrenched media rent collectors, which is similar to yahoo, except that they are profitable.<p>So, in finality, I find that statement absurd, but I am glad you enjoy yahoo.

Paints an inaccurate history of I/O and where problems come in. The I/O actually started more complex and effective with dedicated I/O processors, architecture, & programs. This eventually became Channel I/O for mainframes:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_channel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_channel</a><p>Thanks to that, the compute nodes are always computing and I/O processors are always handling the interrupts, protocol processing, whatever. This kept utilization and throughput high. Things being so expensive are why they stripped components out until the small machines DOS and UNIX were on didn&#x27;t support crap, esp Channel I/O. Like most legacy effects, such fundamentally architecture was kept in there as hardware improved and got beyond cheap enough for a Channel I/O-like solution. We&#x27;ve seen over past decade various offloading mechanisms but the original architectures were fundamentally better for smart I/O and virtualization. They just weren&#x27;t adopted, forcing people to work around the crap we have in clever ways.<p>Note 1: Even true for embedded as I/O coprocessors can greatly aid determinism and throughput. Upon my suggesting it, Ganssle sent me a SOC that had a mid-to-high end part for compute plus a weaker CPU for I/O handling with many supposed benefits. The old mainframes had a high-end processor for compute plus low-end one for I/O handling. Put a smile on my face to see the lesson rediscovered. :)<p>Note 2: A number of systems, esp kernelized architectures, tried to minimize the amount of OS for user applications or OS&#x27;s starting with VM/370 I believe and KeyKOS later doing nanokernel. So, that isn&#x27;t new either. Rump kernels easy integration with kernels without forks or extensive modifications are a significant innovation, though.",1448428114

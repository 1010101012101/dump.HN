(And this is at an Ivy League graduate school.)<p>I'd say less than half of the professors were willing to really engage in anything that wasn't squarely in the specialty. Also they seemed actively hostile to cross-subject questions like post-modernism's impact on self understanding in a psychology class discussion. That disdain of learning about multiple subjects is modeled by their undergraduate and graduate students.

Only the text itself changes somewhat.<p>The width of tab/positions of tabstops has nothing to do with font itself; it's property (often settable) of the editor (or in rare case of the underlying terminal). May be expressed as `times the space width', but that's it.<p>Perhaps you mean aligning of function argument and/or parameters one below another, or indentation of parts of expressions one below another? That indeed can't work with proportional font IF the peers in your project use different font (size or shape) or tab-stop setting. Can't work with monospaced font either -- again, IF the peers on your project use different tab-stop settings. Which is prevalent, AFAIK. Some use 12'' netbooks, other use 23'' desktops. I've even known a guy who used a T221 [1]. One size does not fit all.<p>Nb., you may want to read up on <a href=""http://nickgravgaard.com/elastictabstops/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nickgravgaard.com/elastictabstops/</a> if you like to align stuff that way.

2583838,comment,2583200,2583601,4,0,auganov,,,"You are completely right, US is best in the world in that narrow sense and this is what matters for me.<p>You see until high school I was studying in my home country, an European one, next I went to high school for a year in the US which had a large population of Asian foreign exchange students. Then I did a year of non-degree studying in China (not very relevant to the discussion) and now I study on-line following a British curriculum.<p>I saw a LOT of Asians and Europeans struggle with the curriculum in the US. Language issues? For some, yes, but I knew a lot of people that struggled simply because they were not used to the way Americans are thought. I had friends complain that they were doing great back in their home country and now were just average. (I virtually only had foreign-Asian friends, foreigners didn't really hang with the Americans which is another story). And some courses were indeed simply more rigorous in the US than back home.<p>What an average student in any country learns is how to beat the game, that's what school almost everywhere is about, not about deep understanding. That's why it's enough to change a few variables in the game and those students that supposedly followed a more rigorous course find themselves struggling like my friends in the US.
The same thing happens at average universities. You just have to beat the game to get the diploma. Europeans on average have to beat a slightly more difficult game, big deal.<p>Do you really think that there is a significant difference? I took AP calc and then Maths 1 at that British school. The most notable difference? No calculator on the test. Of course, they do throw far more rigorous explanations at you, use fancier vocabulary, give you more trick questions, but to pass the test you dont have to be much better, you just have to adjust to the game. European students will be as clueless about the simple Epsilon-Delta Proof as American are.
They simply cram in a little more to students overseas. (cram as in learn without understanding rather than study hard). I dont really see an European student being somehow smarter than youre average American one. Trust me, after travelling a lot, getting to know many cultures average people seem average everywhere and extraordinary people are always extraordinary[1]. US happens to produce and draw most of those.<p>I don't know, I might be going too far with that argument, but I strongly believe that those few top-class people which will be leaders in their respective fields will contribute to the economy far more than having each average person be a little better. As in it's better to have 1000 stupid soldiers led by a genius than 1000 slightly less stupid soldiers led by a moderately intelligent person.<p>I'm not saying there's nothing to fix, there's tons of fixing to be done in every single country.
I just think that as a whole country the US should focus on sustaining that comparative advantage in higher education, as long as it has that US is the world-wide leader of education, at least for me.<p>[1] For some people it takes a lot of time to get to that stage, some might outright disagree with me. Most people have trouble filtering cultural differences and often see falsely assume that people in a certain culture are just better, because they use their native benchmarks to judge people elsewhere and the other way around.",1306329418

There was no value placed on the image until it became popular and like she said, there was no intent to make money from the image. The various news outlets that were mentioned, though, definitely should have tracked her down and at least requested usage rights. Until the internet as a whole develops its own form of copyright law, people will continue to abuse things like this.",1306329197

I noticed that I started to regard my Mac as ""soft"" and ""friendly"", and my Windows machine (with large external monitors) was ""harsh"". I felt mildly stressed out working on the Windows machine, even though I would frequently switch between them sitting at the same desk.<p>So, on a whim, I looked up the font on the Mac (Monaco), and set it up on Putty, and (surprisingly) it made a big difference. I felt like the code I had was easier to read, and I just generally worked better.<p>I've since decided I like Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, but at this point it's just something I set up on new computers, with no thought. It's not a rational thing, but who ever says I have to feel rationally about my tools? :)",1306329054

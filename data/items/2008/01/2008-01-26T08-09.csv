Some other people have mentioned downtown Mountain View around Castro Street (try Dana Street Cafe) which is pretty cool and close to a lot of software and hardware shops. There are some nice places in downtown Palo Alto but I don't know the prices there anymore. Back up near SF you may want to look at the Mission district, specifically between Valencia and Dolores south of 16th Street. It's a transitional neighborhood, great food, lots of walking distance small shops, but you may find your car broken into if you leave anything inside.<p>We are paying $3000/month for a nice old 3bdrm Craftsman in Rockridge that is about 5min walking from the BART station and about 2min from the College Ave strip.",1201337620

It hasn't...<p>For those who want to continue to wake up to just some meaningless noise can continue to do so...

If there is a problem, and it is more or less common, there are going to be message boards, IRC logs and various blog entries talking about it. Google finds them all. You, on the other end, rely only on your own DB. Sounds like ""one man vs army"" kind of deal to me.<p>Sorry. You asked what I think and this is it.",1201334745

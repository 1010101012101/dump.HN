One of the fundamental questions is whether or not you giving up the key is testimonial or not. There is a litany of things which have been held to not be testimonial, and thus not implicated by the 5th amendment, including giving up your saliva, blood, fingerprints, standing in a line up, etc.<p>The really interesting legal question to me is as neuroscience  advances, it is likely in the near future that scientists may be able recover one&#x27;s key (or other relevant information regarding crime) through studying one&#x27;s brain by imaging or the use of other sensors. Under current case law there is a really really good argument this would not be testimonial (i.e. it is similar to taking your fingerprints or blood), yet provides the same information they could obtain by compelling your testimony.<p>Does the 5th Amendment prohibit the government from scanning your brain to obtain information about a crime? I think there is a significant number of judges who would find under current law it does not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law#United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law#United_State...</a>",1422032091

Most places outside of the JS engine are using infallible allocation, and have been for a number of years.<p>The basic problem is that error handling for tiny allocations is unlikely to be ever tested, and thus have potentially critical security bugs.  This is not merely a theoretical concern: one of the Pwn2Own exploits for Firefox last year relied on an error in some OOM handling code, resulting in remote code execution.<p>Instead, Firefox just crashes if an allocation fails (in most places), and Mozilla gets a crash report.  If a particular allocation fails enough, usually due to being a large allocation, then it will show up in our crash statistics, and that particular location can be made fallible.

The first pass of the game used Box2D for collision detection, under the assumption that they&#x27;d done a ton of work optimizing it with AABB trees/etc and everything would just work.<p>It didn&#x27;t. The first version of the game was brutally slow and every time we did a touch collision detection, it would lag like crazy.<p>Out of frustration, we ripped out Box2D entirely and replaced it with naive O(n) box testing and hand-written motion code, thinking that we&#x27;d add in some optimizations later on to make it more performant. It turns out that this was fast enough without any further optimizations and we shipped it. The overhead of using a physics system was enough to bog down the iPad 1&#x27;s poor non-JIT JS engine.<p>Fortunately there&#x27;s enough spare cycles in modern tablets that a little bit of overhead from a physics engine isn&#x27;t going to be a problem, although I&#x27;d wager there&#x27;s a handful of Android tablets out there still as weak as the iPad 1.",1422030528

If you can bump those numbers into the millions, you&#x27;re really going to cash in. There are little kids selling promotions on Vine that make more than their parents.<p>Interestingly enough, I find you can either get spammy and low-quality and cash out a lot now, or build a legitimate audience and following, and create revenue that lasts for a long time. The spammier you are, the faster you make money, but the faster it disappears.<p>There are four obvious ways you can make money from this:<p>1. Find a good affiliate program, hawk their goods every now and then, and make a small percentage. This is surprisingly hard, but when done right makes a bunch.<p>2. Drive traffic to a site with adsense. You have to drive more traffic than you would ever believe, but it&#x27;s relatively secure.<p>3. Sell tweets/promotion to other folks. This is pretty easy, but obviously you won&#x27;t have much control over what people are using your accounts for.<p>4. Create/license what blackhatters call a &quot;panel,&quot; and write an automated way anyone can come and use your accounts for a fee. This usually requires a lot of really small accounts, not a few big ones, but even blackhat noobs can make $100/day with a couple thousand accounts doing this (you can buy accounts for cheap). This gives you even less control, and basically turns you into a giant spam bot.<p>Contact me off-list and I can explain a little bit more in depth how it&#x27;s done and put you in contact with some good folks (email in bio).<p>Be sure to check out sites like instafluence.com and sponsoredtweets.com (even celebrities). Legit companies pay a lot of money for promotion from big accounts. I know candycrush was paying over $1/download, and a few people pulled in $10K+/month. There are even people making a few thousand dollars a month selling cheap tweets/posts to places like fiverr.com or seoclerks.com - generally lower quality, higher volume accounts.

And that&#x27;s why I conclude that they have a very specific definition of what counts as IF and what doesn&#x27;t. We could discuss about the details what exactly is part of IF and what isn&#x27;t. But that&#x27;s not the point anyway. The point is, that IF people can be proud because text heavy games are quite successful, but maybe they shouldn&#x27;t think so purist.",1422028811

It may be more work but I&#x27;d love to work directly with makers within a niche and set a 10% or so affiliate price, on a set of products e.g. a style of clothes, drones, IoT, wearables etc and create a long-term focus rather than trying to grab pennies/cents. Whoever&#x27;s left that can still game the Facebook algorithm for millions of instant clicks (something I&#x27;ve never done/tried to do) would probably do great with these affiliates, like the kid who does dose.com",1422028805

Google fonts?  Blocked.<p>Need a picture?  Instagram?  Blocked.<p>Need a video?  Youtube?  Blocked.<p>Need a CSS sheet? Use a CDN?  Blocked or really slow.<p>Visiting a text-based website hosted outside of China [from within China] is usually pretty good.  No VPN necessary.<p>CDNs are a Firewall quick-kill, a lazy-kill.  If you host a site outside China, that you&#x27;d like to be visible within China, self-host anything you&#x27;d otherwise think about off-loading to a CDN.  That makes the need for a VPN for your audience redundant.",1422028801

Some other names worth checking out might be Eben Pagan and Jeff Walker who focus on the information product niche. I&#x27;ve had success with their material.",1422028800

A lot of these things won&#x27;t have been spelled out in books at the time because it seemed obvious once you&#x27;d used an Amiga for a while.<p>Some of them certainly expect single-user. I think Linux etc. loses out quite a bit by not differentiating between single user (in terms of &quot;person in front of the machine is most important, regardless of <i>uid</i>) and multi-user systems.<p>Some of it could be emulated by tweaking priorities. But others require a large change in how you think about applications. E.g. the widget (&quot;gadget&quot; in Amiga-speak) responsiveness largely comes from the <i>OS</i> threads carrying out updates of them. To do the same in an X app for example, you&#x27;d need your app to explicitly start a separate thread to forward events to your main thread, and have a mechanism for giving it higher priority. It&#x27;s not that hard to do, but without libraries providing wrappers for it, it won&#x27;t happen often.<p>Other things, like the assigns could be implemented easily enough with a filesystem driver. Coupled with namespaces you certainly can do this transparently in a multi-user system.<p>Memory protection helped reducing the cost of context switches, and certainly there has been a variety of sins carried out as a result of it being possible to pass data all over the place without paying much attention to it. But it&#x27;s not that integral to the things that make AmigaOS unique.<p>With respect to ARM systems, AROS runs on ARM (and x86, PPC, m68k) and AROS is relatively close to parity with the lastest AmigaOS releases (including features from the 4.x series for PPC). I think at least one AROS distribution has images for Raspberry Pi for example. If nothing else it&#x27;s a good place to get a feel for how some of it works.",1437403924

Maybe she&#x27;ll understand that we make them for this purpose. Would she understand why this is a big deal? How about a swing? Does a chimpanzee understand a swing? I have never personally known one, but I imagine that if a close friend of a chimpanzee was wont to occasionally come by with a rope and tire and construct a swing, she would eventually understand these can be sued to make swing. Is the difference between swing because the highway is more advanced or because it is more remotely related to fun?<p>We&#x27;ve got questions to answer before we make these analogies.

The drama of home furniture is that you can often get something decent but not very special for an ok price, but then … then you see this really cool looking thing right next to it that would add that little bit extra … but costs an order of magnitude more. I’m not sure why prices are so weird when it comes to that. I mean, someone like Ikea is sort of attacking that market and those prices in some weird way, but those upscale places still exist.

My understanding is that Berlekamp&#x27;s book is all about applying combinatorial game theory to go, and the &quot;chilling&quot; in question has very little to do with the &quot;temperature-decrease&quot; schedule in simulated annealing.<p>&quot;Chilling&quot; in combinatorial game theory means, in effect, making players pay a penalty for each move they make. The simplest games to analyse are ones in which it&#x27;s always a disadvantage to have to move; these are equivalent in a certain sense to <i>numbers</i>; the &quot;chilling&quot; operation tends to turn games into simpler games. See e.g. <a href=""http://senseis.xmp.net/?Chilling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://senseis.xmp.net/?Chilling</a> for a little more information.<p>The only connection between this and what happens in simulated annealing is that temperature happens to be a good metaphor for both. In combinatorial games, that&#x27;s because the &quot;value&quot; of a position changes less wildly with each move in a cooled/chilled game. In simulated annealing, it&#x27;s because the configuration you&#x27;re looking at changes less wildly on each successful update as the temperature decreases.",1437402693

9916262,comment,9914042,9915303,0,0,lorenzhs,,,"what you are describing is substring matching, which can be implemented much more efficiently using algorithms such as Knuth-Morris-Pratt [1]. Fuzzy matching is a different concept, and although the definition is a bit fuzzy (haha), it usually refers to Levenshtein distance (which the author specifically states he didn&#x27;t implement) or Hamming distance. Note that Levenshtein distance on substrings is easy to implement, you only need to
a) remember the maximum value encountered and what it matched (to match prefixes)
b) not penalize gaps in the beginning (to match suffixes).<p>Thus:<p><pre><code>    M[0,j] = M[i,0] = 0
    M[i,j] = max(0,
                 M[i-1,j-1] + (needle[i] == haystack[j]),
                 M[i-1,j] + 1,
                 M[i,j-1] + 1)
</code></pre>
Additionally, store the highest value x and its position (i,j). When you&#x27;ve got the full matrix, return (x,i,j). In Bioinformatics, this is known as the Smith-Waterman algorithm [2] and the result would satisfy the requirements of fuzzy substring matching.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93P...</a>

Basically we are small teams catching up to what governments or larger companies are doing. It takes time.<p>1. Tech development: It requires changes in thinking, tools, procedures etc. Perhaps harder than tech itself is to acquire the required mindset.<p>2. Legal: Space law is fun but complex once it goes into the details. US laws like ITAR (now a bit milder than before) haunt us. Plus plenty of other laws.<p>3. Funding: It&#x27;s hard to make business cases for a (literal) moonshot. Sponsorship and payload are the main revenue sources, but most teams don&#x27;t succeed. Their story (or presentation) is not exciting or convincing, their team is not adequate (skills, mentality, manpower), so they don&#x27;t get sponsors, investors, or customers. Or they&#x27;re just in a country where risk is not rewarded or capital is absent.<p>4. Launch: Finding the right rocket is important; it influences spacecraft design. Then negotiating a contract and sticking to it. Many hurdles. And it&#x27;s expensive before the launch. Launch is the biggest cost center.<p>5. Politics: XPRIZE Foundation is a US org, so US law and politics determine much of what you (not) do, e.g. avoid tech or people from blacklisted countries. Or when geopolitics kicks in and the rocket in another country suddenly or potentially becomes unavailable.<p>And much more. So we&#x27;re making progress. But it&#x27;s not something we talk about much.<p>I just realize that I wrote the five points above in a kind of negative tone. They&#x27;re not. E.g. once you have the required mindset, you&#x27;re filled with nearly unshakable certainty about what you do and why. Laws are solved problems--or when they work on them, they make open problems pretty clear. The pressure to find business cases makes you think hard about what is possible and economical at what time, you start to see a roadmap of doable things until you reach your goal; after all to kickstart private space is one of the GLXP&#x27;s intentions. The launch sector is a funny business, you meet interesting people and it gives you insights into one of the greatest filters that still stops humanity from going into space at large scales. Politics is not always a burden, it can also be a source of support and goodwill; e.g. if you align interests and avoid stepping on the wrong toes, it can be very helpful.<p>So, yeah, space is hard. But we&#x27;re getting there.",1437402326

With older APIs (pre-Mantle/Vulkan/DX12) it&#x27;s really opaque how to produce correct and performant code.  And even past that, AAA game devs have enough clout to basically force hardware companies to fix their bugs, eg one major game never made BeginFrame/EndFrame calls which is a horrendous violation of API rules.  You don&#x27;t want to have &quot;broken drivers&quot; on launch day while it works on your competitor&#x27;s hardware.<p>This results in a game of pattycake where the game developers and the driver developers are both guessing at what the other will do, and trying to optimize for it.  So game releases basically require having an NVIDIA/AMD developer sit down, profile your code, and figure out which of the tens-to-hundreds of thousands of behavior triggers and optimizations should be turned on for your game.<p>What&#x27;s probably going on here is that CS:GO is having a different set of optimizations applied from its parent game (or hasn&#x27;t had any at all applied yet on Linux).  The big question here is whether CS:GO actually works 100% reliably on those settings, on all AMD GPUs, on all possible combinations of graphics settings.  Because it&#x27;s very possible that it doesn&#x27;t, or that no one has verified that it does.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gamedev.net/topic/666419-what-are-your-opinions-on-dx12vulkanmantle/?view=findpost&p=5215019"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamedev.net/topic/666419-what-are-your-opinions-o...</a>",1437401630

Despite the limitations of spellcheck and misused word detection they are still a valuable safety net to have.<p>2. The style checker is useful for helping you write better.  Writers like to come up with massive lists of pet peeves.  Memorizing these lists is too much for a human.  After the Deadline automatically flags this stuff.  It isn't the same as a human editor but it does help.<p>3. A good copy editor will flag and revise most cases of passive voice and hidden verbs.  After the Deadline doesn't rewrite these for you but it does flag them.  This is a useful service to call your attention to these things.   See: <a href=""http://jaffeerevises.com/Nominalizations.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jaffeerevises.com/Nominalizations.htm</a><p>4. After the Deadline explains your errors when you make them.  When you write in passive voice you can click ""explain"" and learn what passive voice is.  If you use the wrong indefinite article you can click explain and learn why it is wrong.  I see these as teachable moments and by giving you snippets of grammar info when you need it, I am helping to make you a more aware writer.<p>BTW I recommend Write to the Point by Bill Stott.

It <i>seems</i> economical, in that you get two things (a program and a proof) for the price of one.<p>However, my experience is that adding extra constraints to a problem makes it harder and more complex to solve, whereas separating out different aspects (divide&conquer) makes it easier. Jack of all trades/serving two masters etc. That is, you'll write better code if that's all you're doing; and you'll write a better proof if that's your sole purpose. ""To hit a bird on the wing your whole mind must be on that bird..."" etc.<p>Ironically, the power I personally find in a mathematical approach is that you can freely separate out constraints in any way you like, regardless of usability or performance, in order to show some quality clearly.

There is an incredible amount of crazy shit going on in any real start-up, stuff that threatens the very existence of the start-up, on a pretty regular basis. ""The world could end tomorrow"" seems almost like the standard situation for most of the early life of the start-up. If you can't get stuff done in those conditions, you're pretty much toast right from the start.<p>I wonder what other skill correlates with this... I've always had an (un)healthy ability to ignore people around me and focus on whatever it is I'm doing (whether it's working, reading, playing computer games, etc). That ability also applies to meta-distractions... I can still throw myself into my work even when I don't know if that work will still have any meaning the next day, or when something really disruptive has just happened in my personal life, or when I'm sitting under a large cloud of uncertainty about my future. Sometimes that might give the impression that I don't care about what's happening around me, but I do - it's just that I can put it aside and focus on the task at hand...<p>From the same slide:<p><i>You should not do it if... you have a low appetite for risk</i><p>I would disagree with that, though. Appetite is the wrong word. I don't like risk, I don't enjoy it, and I avoid it whenever possible. However, what I think does help is to have a high <i>tolerance</i> for risk.

I couldn't get past the first one in this article:<p>> Acronym: this is a word, like radar or NATO, not a set of initials, like the BBC or the IMF.<p>Wikipedia:<p>> In 1943, Bell Laboratories coined the term acronym as the name for a word (such as SONAR) created from the first letters of each word in a series of words (such as SOund Navigation And Ranging). The terms initialism and alphabetism are neither widely used nor widely known. The term acronym is widely used to describe any abbreviation formed from initial letters.<p>First off, the word was created by a <i>corporation</i>; secondly, the term is widely used and understood to apply to words like ""BBC"" (""Three Letter Acronym""); thirdly, the ""correct"" alternative is not widely used or understood. So if you use the correct terms your communication would actually be <i>less</i> clear, which is, as I understand, the point of studying grammar/linguistics in the first place.<p>For more on this exciting subject, see David Foster Wallace's excellent ""Democracy, English, and the Wars over Usage"":<p><a href=""http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/DFW_present_tense.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/DFW_present_tense.html</a>",1243869496

It's been a happy coincidence, but, inevitably, that ship has about finished its trip and is heading back to the dock.<p>Here's what will happen (and is happening) when hardware hits that limit: pretty much nothing. People will still use computers for email, browsing the web, watching videos, numerically solving partial differental equations, etc. There will be no clamour to make faster computers because computers are pretty much fast enough for what we want them to do. If they're not fast enough, then tasks can be spread out and handled in a distributed manner.<p>Oh, also, computer hardware companies will find that they can't get you to upgrade every few years to get the latest and greatest. This is great news, btw, for, say, schools; since they'll be able to invest in computers and expect to keep them long enough to be worth the investment.",1243869358

Go to the library, look through some art and design books, if you see a style you like then write it down and emulate it (don't copy it outright, just use it as a framework or guidance). If you're into what a lot of people here are calling ""minimal"", look at modernism and the swiss-style. Browse published graphic design poster histories and start to pay attention to how the compositions are put together and what makes styles similar and different, and typography.

Taken to its logical conclusion, you could observe the same result in a hundred experiments and dismiss it as merely a strong correlation.""<p>The problem here is that there are no actual experiments done on the climate - it's all models, the outputs of which are essentially unverifiable.  In other words, nobody is taking a test planet Earth and a control planet Earth and filling the test version's atmosphere up with CO2 and seeing what the difference is, much less repeating this and getting the same results.<p>That is why, despite the fact that these models are based on scientific theory, the models themselves are not, strictly speaking, ""science"".

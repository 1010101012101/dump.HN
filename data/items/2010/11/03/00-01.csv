The only difference for me before and after (getting married) is the amount of time you have available for your startup before you need to spend time with your wife or kids.

You're an HN user. Start with telling people on HN about it. Ask a designer from HN to collab with you on it, making it explicit that it's a silly portfolio builder and that you'd both be doing it for that purpose.<p>You don't have to make a product you'd be <i>selling</i>, just...make something.

Something you can show people, even if it's just an open source helper-library you can talk about in a tech-screening.<p>>But the splash page sucks, and it's confusing, so I'm scrapping it.<p>Start from scratch, get help, get feedback, respond to feedback and pivot quickly. Don't let it languish without seeking advice and learning.<p>>But, I don't have a personal website, or a blog, or a twitter account, etc.<p>Well, I don't like that sort of thing either, so here's what I did. I made a very plain business card website. It links to a blog that's actually got a single post (but a thoughtful one, I'd like to think) that is in fact a tech demo for a micro CMS I rebuild a few times a year from scratch.<p>It also links to my CV which is W3-conforming html/css.<p>It also links to my twitter which acts as more of a connector-hub. I'm not an active twitter user, I just use it to ping random industry people occasionally. I'm not saying you should become some kind of social networking maven...just...poke, prod, get yourself out there a bit.<p>You don't have to be <i>famous</i>, you just have to have a presence of some kind.<p>Look at how many people in writing/journalism or in the entertainment industry that have a <i></i>presence<i></i> but aren't necessarily 'famous'. That's what you need to seek.<p>Just because you don't have the capacity or credentials to become some kind of coding superstar doesn't mean you shouldn't try at all.<p>>This is the type of advice I'm looking for.<p>In the new economy, being a more efficient resume-monger isn't enough.

We're here because we glory in achievements and advancements, code and business alike. This isn't the monster.com forums where we talk about how to better organize our 100 resume and cover letter submissions per week.<p>I'd like to finish by saying, please don't respond to this looking for some kind of way to rationalize or defend your accomplishments/approach to job hunting. It's not my business, it's not the business of those reading this thread. You came for help/advice, and I tried to introduce a different way of thinking about your career.<p>Good luck, this is where I sign off.",1288745268

Species survival would be one of them.<p>There are plenty of possibilities for extinction events right here. Super-volcano eruptions, radical climate change, polar shifting, airborne super-bugs (hello zombie apocalypse!), nuclear mayhem, etc.<p>Our local environment also has plenty of hazards. Asteroid impact, engulfment in a large solar flare, orbital shifts are the ones that spring to mind.<p>Our little niche in the galaxy might also have to deal with wandering black holes, gamma-ray bursts from a supernova that is just near enough, the long-term problem of the collision with Andromeda, etc. We won't overcome any of those by colonizing Mars, but still some things to keep in mind.<p>On a more practical note, extreme endeavors like colonizing space require some radical thinking (and re-thinking of existing concepts). Colonizing means establishing a foothold outside Earth that is self-sustaining (i.e. can do without a lifeline to Earth). We can't actually do that right now. If we set that as a goal we're going to come up with some very interesting stuff, a lot of which is bound to be useful down here.<p>Life expands or dies, that's the way it works over here.

I rather think we are at a point where incremental improvements are yielding better results in shorter time than revolutionary changes.<p>Examples: How many revolutionary replacements for DRAM have been proposed since the 1103 was introduced?  Yet what do we  use today?  DRAM, because it could incrementally improve to be better and/or cheaper before competing technologies could be introduced<p>How many revolutionary replacements for the ICE have been proposed?  Various jet engines have largely replaced it for aircraft, but the ICE is used just about everywhere else.<p>How about von neumann computers?  There have been many other architectures proposed, but for general purpose computing it still wins out.<p>The fact that I am writing on this with something that is merely the sum of many incremental improvements to the Apple II just demonstrates the huge amount of untapped potential in the design when it was introduced, not that innovation has stopped.",1288743267

Skip to 2009 and that number a bit over half (24.8BN), with online newspaper advertising not even getting in 3BN. That seems like a major loss in revenue to newspapers, one that must be making an impact.<p>According to the NYT's 10-K [2], 53% of revenue comes from advertising! Yet in 2005, 66% did [3].<p>Also remember as print subscribers fall off, those costs fall off too. The raw cost of materials was around 30% of subscriber revenue, although I think they trimmed the size of it down to help out there. Wages for the actual print side are another fair portion.<p>So, contrary to other claims, it would seem that advertising generates quite enough revenue to cover journalists.<p>EDIT: Perhaps _online_ advertising isn't enough to cover salaries, but that's a separate issue. The newspapers are trying to make a transition as that nice money from advertising (especially classifieds) dries up.

And even with only a single data point I could state (and still can) with very high confidence that no matter what implementation you run your test on, the break-even point will be less than 5000.  A LOT less.  You'd have to go out of your way to find a hash table implementation so bad that the break-even point was even within an order of magnitude of 5000.  Even just reasoning from first principles you could reasonably guess that the break-even would be a lot less than 5000.  Traversing a 5000-element AList requires 5000 memory accesses, with no guarantees of locality of reference so you're probably blowing out your cache dozens (thousands if you're unlucky) of times.  You probably couldn't write a hash table implementation whose performance was that bad if you tried.<p>The fact of the matter is that hash tables are faster than ALists in all but the most trivial of cases.

All rebase operations create a brand new branch and merely repoint a ref at it.  The original pre-rebase branch is still untouched, and ""git reset HEAD@{0}"" (see: git-reflog) will reverse the effects of any rebase (and of course, you can undo the undo).  Rebase does not affect synchronization in any way except that two users may have very different commit histories that they both call ""master"".  Git handles the synchronization fine, however, so this is a social issue rather than a technical issue.  I regularly work on large projects with many committers that rebase, and I have never had any difficulty.  Hell, git pull even defaults to ""git pull --rebase"" now, so you probably won't even see any merge commits when you pull from someone's rebased branch now.<p><i>Ultimately git simplifies the work of project maintainers at the expense of day-to-day development</i><p>I disagree again.  Git makes both day-to-day work easy, and it makes maintaining the project easy.  When you are in hacking mode, you just commit with a short message whenever you feel like it.  Commit freely, branch freely, merge freely, undo freely.  When you are done and you want to cleanup your work to share, you can quickly split commits, combine commits, reorder commits, add better commit messages, and so on.  Then, you can push to a public repository, ask someone to pull your branch, or just email patches around.  If you mess it up somewhere, everything is undoable.  Git even has tools to make merge conflicts easy to handle; if it sees a conflict you've manually repaired before, it can automatically try that repair without bothering you again.<p>Anyway, it's clear that some people take issue with people ""rewriting history"" and that they will never use git.  But I take issue with having to maintain projects that have an incomprehensible (but ""historically accurate"" in the sense that I know exactly what the state was when some random person on the Internet typed ""commit"") history, and so I use git.  It is the most efficient use of my time and mental energy, and is why its become so popular.",1288742428

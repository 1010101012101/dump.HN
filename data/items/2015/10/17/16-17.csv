10405065,comment,10404312,10404977,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"There is a difference between being a demanding parent and being a helicopter parent. A demanding parent sets high expectations and offers support, but the kid must bring their own motivation and effort. A helicopter parent not only sets high expectations but does the work <i>for the student</i> to make sure they are met.<p>The classic example is the parent who goes into the school and harangues the teacher when their student gets a bad grade on an assignment. A demanding parent communicates their disappointment with their kid, not the teacher. A demanding parent lets their kid fail and then delivers consequences. Overcoming failure is how people develop motivation and mental toughness.<p>Stanford (and Harvard, MIT, CalTech, etc.) have been hard to get into for many decades, and students got into them. Helicopter parents justify their coptering with the sentiment above, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s true. You don&#x27;t need to helicopter to have a high performing kid.<p>And not every kid is going to perform at the top level, and IMO a good parent needs to be ok with that. I think when the parental expectations don&#x27;t meet reality, that&#x27;s when helicoptering can start.",1445101088

Basically, certain immune cells go into an inflamed area and start generating and releasing as many free radicals as they can in order to cause maximum damage. So if that particular immune mechanism is important in the body&#x27;s response to cancer, then taking excessive antioxidants could plausibly impair the body&#x27;s ability to fight cancer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10807157"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10807157</a>",1445101018

Sanders, though I certainly prefer him over her, is basically a sideshow to make it look like the Democrats actually support liberal issues and aren&#x27;t just a moderate deviation from the one-party system. If they didn&#x27;t run anyone besides Clinton many people would consider supporting a third party or independent candidate, but having Sanders around keeps them identifying with the DNC until he finally gives up the campaign and endorses Clinton.<p>Support for people who aren&#x27;t likely to win the general election at least shows what issues are important to voters, forcing them to give some concessions to those issues in order not to lose their base to third parties and independents. That&#x27;s the real power of supporting people like Lessig and Sanders, even though they clearly won&#x27;t win. Supporting someone you disagree with more just because they&#x27;re likely to win is truly &quot;throwing your vote away&quot; - it&#x27;s working against your own policy preferences to give more votes to someone who doesn&#x27;t even need them.",1445100955

He went on to say that the role Snowden played in educating the public about violations of their civil liberties should be considered before he is sentenced, and that as president he would &quot;absolutely&quot; end the NSA spying programs in question.<p>and I would have disagreed with the analysis<p>> To read between the lines: Bernie thinks Edward Snowden did the right thing, but hey, laws are laws. If elected, though, it sounds like he&#x27;ll make sure Snowden gets a really nice jail cell.<p>and said something along the lines of &quot;the political system pardoned President Nixon without even going through the trouble of actually charging him with a crime. If a man like Nixon deserves pardon, I&#x27;d say Snowden does as well.&quot; But I am not Bernie Sanders and I can&#x27;t put words in his mouth. He urged Snowden to come home and face trial. This may be a comforting thing for the people at home who watch the 8 PM news but this is not the right thing to do. Not in a nation that pardons people before they are convicted of a crime. No, I don&#x27;t mean we should dig up Nixon&#x27;s grave and hang, quarter, and draw his body (I wouldn&#x27;t oppose doing so to Margaret Thatcher as the UK a historical precedence of such actions but that is off-topic). I don&#x27;t even want to charge Nixon. All I am saying is there is a way to grant Edward Snowden the same amnesty and immunity that we gave President Nixon. Not because what the the two did were similar but I bring it up just as a demonstration of the things we have forgiven and forgotten as a nation.<p>Edward Snowden did is a huge public service and he deserves our thanks for it. I am not the person above but this is why I am a little disappointed. I am a little concerned about Bernie Sanders saying as president he would &quot;absolutely&quot; end the NSA spying programs in question. Does the POTUS have access to everything that goes on in the NSA? Can&#x27;t the programs continue/reboot under a different pretense?

8234426,comment,8233954,8233954,3,0,electronvolt,,,"I feel like this is a kind of naive approach that might work for some end user programs, but isn&#x27;t a good principle in general.  Large/monolithic programs like databases, operating systems, compilers, etc. all can benefit from added overall complexity. (new data structures for storing data on disk, better memory management and program separation, better/more aggressive optimization+static analysis+etc.) You can argue that monolithic programs like those should be broken down into smaller parts (they already are, though), but in the end adding an R*-tree to a database allows you to do more types of lookups efficiently and makes your program /better/.<p>The thing that no developer really benefits from is added state complexity.  But we&#x27;ve spent the last 30+ years coming up with ways to hide that kind of complexity from a programmer.  That&#x27;s /why/ we have our programs and processes divided into boxes (PL, OS, etc.) and /why/ we use things like higher level languages instead of assembly, object oriented programming, and general data hiding.  On the other hand, it sounds much less sexy to say &quot;People should do a better job of following best practices, and a lot of the problems in our industry are because people prefer to glue things onto existing code instead of being willing to do a higher level restructuring of a code base when a new need is established.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d agree that a lot of programming is not science.  We shouldn&#x27;t be treating it as such.  The harder parts of programming are an application of theoretical mathematics (Dijkstra pointed this out years ago, and it&#x27;s still true), but very little of CS is &#x27;science&#x27; the way something like physics or chemistry is &#x27;science&#x27;.",1409169581

The mathematics involved don&#x27;t seem too difficult; you have to add another axis to your vectors, points, and transform matrices, and you can place and orient your models in 4D space, set up lights and a camera in 4D space, and project the camera&#x27;s view into 3D space first then onto the 2D display. I think the hard part is creating the models and writing the rendering engine. Creating 4D models, rather than just putting 3D models into 4D space, would be hard to wrap your head around. And the tools, both for world creation and for rendering, are almost certainly limited to 3D so you&#x27;d have to write your own tools for everything. No more GPU acceleration, unless your 4D to 3D transformation creates models and textures on-the-fly to pass to the GPU.",1409169493

It is a broncho-dilator so this made perfect sense (it&#x27;s also a vaso-dilator so that had some interesting side effects). The Iodine link is less solid, but after several minor indicators I ran across this:<p><a href=""http://thyroid.about.com/library/derry/bl10.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thyroid.about.com/library/derry/bl10.htm</a><p>and some other great reading. This lead me to start taking kelp regularly, which helped stabilize my blood sugar and other things (that&#x27;s another story, but very conclusive). Only after all that did I start to exercise and lose weight, and after months of that I got the asthma rechecked.<p>For a while in there I took Lugol&#x27;s iodine quite regularly too in the hope of reducing cholesterol - which it is supposed to do - but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I had my thyroid tested (TSH, T4) before and after that phase though, so I can confirm that taking Iodine does not (for me) screw up the thyroid as is widely believed. My triglycerides went from ~300 to 160 though.<p>My wife also used Lugol&#x27;s to significantly heal a surgical scar - almost eliminated it. Iodine is wonderful, unfortunately the folks who promote it sound like an infomercial, but it truly is amazing stuff.

8234397,comment,8233954,8233954,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<brain dump>\nComplexity really is the enemy. A couple of thoughts:<p>- In programming, our job is to move over the &quot;complexity hump.&quot; We hear a problem, we analyze it, we code it, then we simplify. Most really bad code comes from programmers never pushing past the hump. They just slash away at whatever problem is in front of them.<p>- When we move past the hump, we push complexity off. Sometimes this is done by abstraction, sometimes by a reduction in terms. In either case, our job is to make the complexity go away. If we&#x27;re still dealing with arcane issues a month from now? We&#x27;re not past the hump.<p>- Many times we believe we&#x27;ve simplified a problem, only to have the complexities jump out and bite us again later. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s best to &quot;exercise your code&quot; to make sure that your abstractions or re-organizations will hold up in the real world. Use it in different contexts. When we don&#x27;t exercise our code enough, we get complexity debt. The old &quot;works on my machine&quot; is now &quot;works in these 12 cases I tried&quot;<p>- Every tool we pick up has some degree of complexity debt depending on how much it has been exercised in various contexts. Stuff like *nix command line programs? They rock. The reason they rock is because they have a billion different scenarios in which they&#x27;ve been proven.<p>- Most modern programming environments involve programmers plugging into x number of tools, all of which have varying degrees of complexity debt. Many a time I&#x27;ve watched a programmer walk down the &quot;happy path&quot; of using a tool or suite. What a happy look! Then they realize they need something that&#x27;s off the happy path. So they&#x27;ve got to pull the source code, inspect the deployed javascript, take a look at the IL, get a new patch, spend an hour on Google. It&#x27;s at this point that the tool/framework stops being a help and becomes a liability.<p>- For this reason, most tools and frameworks are actually liabilities instead of assets. I think there are a lot of programmers that would be amazed at what you can do in C, JSON, simple HTML, and Javascript.<p></brain dump>",1409169264

I&#x27;ll run down the ways I know of to access blame history (in case others don&#x27;t know it exists).<p>1) Git -> Annotate:  This is almost exactly what I wanted!<p>This gives a `git blame`-like column next to each code line, and clicking an item will show a summary of the commit, including both the commit message and fields modified. I can right click one of the annotations and select &quot;show diff&quot;, and can even see the modifications to any of the files in the commit if necessary.<p>Unfortunately, this depends on a commit message explaining why that change mattered, AND on it being the most recent changes to those lines. Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t show the full history of changes for those lines, such as if Alice added the real change, and Bob just did some whitespace changes.<p>I can find such information (with effort) using `gitk` or other git log browsing tools.  If the most recent change (shown with git-blame) doesn&#x27;t have what I need, I basically need to look at all of the changes for this file, going back from that commit, and see if I can find the one with a message that explains why ${hackity-hack} is necessary.<p>2) Right click a file tab or in the editor, and select Git -> Show History<p>This is a faster way of browsing the commit messages, but doesn&#x27;t give enough information for me to tell whether that change was the one that affected the lines I care about.  If it showed the diff of what the commit changed in my file, it would be more informative.  (This is what gitk shows, for example.)<p>As far as I can tell, neither of these options is as comprehensively informative as using `gitk myfile` and backtracking from the commit that `git-blame` (or PyCharm&#x27;s Git->Annotate feature) lists as the most recent change to those lines.<p>If comments don&#x27;t describe what Is Happening or What Should Happen, they should be changed.  This is much harder than maintaining unit test coverage, but I think the information is still very valuable to have in code comments rather than solely in commit messages.

Particularly if you are dealing with more sophisticated constraints like memory fragmentation and other issues, a GC might actually be an easier and lower overhead way of solving the problem.<p>More importantly, you missed the most important aspect of the second point: &quot;you do not pay _for what you do not use_&quot;. You and copx would be surprised to know that pretty much since the standard committee started working on it, garbage collection has been something on the table for C++, but they&#x27;ve never been able to get a proposal that everyone was happy with.<p>I also think that the &quot;No GC&quot; category is perhaps not the right name. What C++ was really about was making UDT&#x27;s first class types and therefore supporting value semantics. A side effect of that is that GC isn&#x27;t nearly the priority it might otherwise be.",1409169108

It&#x27;s hard I think for people to remember that Linux distros are just another program -- even more so, now that we&#x27;ve developed virtualization tools. I spend most of my time in a Kubuntu Linux VM within Windows because my workplace coordinates via Windows applications (Outlook and Spark) but my actual work is strongly enhanced by scripting, ssh, text editors with good grepping and syntax highlighting (usually Kate but also vim from the command line), and a bunch of version control work.<p>Speaking as someone who uses Kubuntu also as a day-to-day Linux environment at home, Kubuntu will do about 90% of what you want to do. I&#x27;ve not had problems with browsing the web, handling network drives, seamlessly connecting to bluetooth, taking a picture with my webcam, calling for hours on Skype, writing an office document and distributing it via email as a PDF, or drawing on a PDF with my touchscreen and saving those annotations for later use. KDE also makes things like screen captures and configuring your toolbars and such really easy, and creating a button to make Chromium open in Incognito mode for day-to-day less-tracked browsing was not too hard.<p>Most Linux environments will do something astonishing which Windows doesn&#x27;t do: you tell it to install something and it will handle the details of going out and fetching it and installing it on your computer (i.e. an app-store). You can just say one day, &quot;hey, I want lighttpd running on this computer so that I can share this image with a friend without putting it on an image-hosting site,&quot; and it&#x27;ll be rapidly accomplished and ready for your use.<p>What it will not do, includes Microsoft Silverlight (hence Netflix).",1409168648

But RFC4787 was published in 2007.<p>The weakness of the 16-bit DNS query ID has been known since long before Kaminsky&#x27;s actual paper. Sensible DNS caches like Daniel Bernstein&#x27;s have been using source port randomization since around the turn of the century. Kaminsky just set a fire under the ones that weren&#x27;t by publishing a devastating proof of concept, so now they all [had better] do it.<p>> The behavior chosen by the implementers of the Linux netfilter code (see simmons&#x27; post) elegantly covers most cases without getting as specific as REQ-5 in the RFC, and not nearly as specific as you&#x27;re describing.<p>What Linux is actually doing seems reasonable. There is no requirement that the DNS timeout has to be short, only that it can be. For smaller networks it shouldn&#x27;t make any real difference.<p>> Network operators just manually configure a faster timeout for port 53. That&#x27;s what the RFC permits: tuning in response to real conditions.<p>Your point was that you have deal with systems that exist in the wild. If some significant percentage of large sites are using very short mapping timeouts for port 53 and you want to handle that, it doesn&#x27;t much matter if it&#x27;s a result of manufacturer defaults or manual configuration.<p>> A hard disconnect is a major event that usually goes all the way back up the stack. A systems designer wants to avoid such a thing, and the sensible thing is to look at the source (of the most commonly deployed implementations).<p>Sometimes all you have is a dog&#x27;s breakfast. If it&#x27;s a common scenario that DNS is the only open UDP port and the mapping timeout for the DNS port can be as little as 5 seconds then you can either always assume that you need a 5 second refresh interval or you can default to a longer one and then have to detect when you&#x27;re wrong.

The ruling political party used to harbour closet racists decades ago but now they&#x27;re getting more and more vocal and out in full force. They allow the extremists from the majority to bully the minority. Minority could be in terms of religion, race, etc. Their strategy is simple.. divide and conquer. If they can incite racial/religious hate, then the moderate majority will be busy suspecting and blaming the minorities while not objecting to extremism. The racist politicians charge opposing party politicians for seditious comments if they were to criticise certain sensitive topics.<p>The moderate majority are either too busy with their own life struggles to care about politics or they are are silenced because they&#x27;re afraid of being charged/jailed. Because if they speak bad about something, they/their family members could be in trouble for &quot;disturbing the peace which is the status quo&quot; (which is of course untrue).<p>So how can I as a Web developer contribute? I worry where the country is headed and so I&#x27;ve thought about this idea of a Heat map on top of a World Map. Any news stories of injustice caused by extremism are recorded (based on the country which it happened) and increases the density of the heat (shown in colours) for that particular country. Snapshots are taken at intervals to show whether extremism is trending up or down for the countries. The linkage between the articles and the countries need to be crowdsourced but I suppose a news stories scraper can help too.<p>The purpose is to show the rest of the world the crimes committed by the people in power (usually politicians) involved. Those evil politicians who had robbed the country&#x27;s wealth and caused suffering for others may get away without trial by court.

The bottom line is that they get away with these shenanigans because at raw speeds 4-5x faster than the next-fastest alternative, and the ability to move unimpeded with minimal infrastructure (terminals at the starting and ending points), which allows aircraft to cross any terrain by taking the shortest path, there is often no other reasonable option.<p>When your options are driving and using up 4 days to get there, paying for gas, lodging, and food throughout the drive, plus deferred costs like wear and tear on your car and the impact this extended travel time may have on your employment, and 4 days back with the same expenses and costs, v. 6 hours in a plane, the answer has to be plane unless the person literally <i>can&#x27;t</i> endure a plane ride without major medical risk.<p>Air travel is excruciating.

Its concentration in the atmosphere increases with surface temperature; hence, warmer surface temperatures lead to more water vapor, which in turn leads to warmer temperatures—a positive feedback loop. Conversely, colder surface temperatures should lead to less water vapor, and to even colder temperatures. So the water vapor feedback makes the faint young sun problem worse, not better.<p>But what about cloud formation? When there is enough water vapor you get more cloud formation, which reflects more sunlight (and traps heat underneath). So that&#x27;s a positive feedback bringing the temperature up and then clouds forming to stabilize it at the point where weather becomes interesting.<p>Once again, I hate the hand waving ideas without simulations - there are problems with both his and mine.",1409167503

The arms are too low to properly rest my shoulders (forcing me essentially to either severely slouch or fold my arms the entire flight), the seats are too close to fully extend my legs, the seat itself has a slight incline so that your knees get particularly more uncomfortable, and the space to the next person (particularly with shared armrests, and overweight people) requires me to slightly bend away from them. All of this combines to muscle cramps in the back for a couple of days after flying. It&#x27;s really a miserable experience that I feel could be largely fixed by the airlines, if they weren&#x27;t in debt, greedy, or dieing.

8234146,comment,8232896,8233969,1,0,Someone1234,,,"It isn&#x27;t confusing at all. When the reason to charge more is material cost (i.e. increased fuel cost) some charge can be justified even if it remains discriminatory in nature (see mens Vs. womens&#x27; health insurance for one example).<p>> First of all, how do you decide that $200 is OK but $350 is not OK?<p>That is easy, look at a normal ticket, figure out how much you&#x27;re paying per inch and then calculate how much they should be charging for ADDITIONAL inches based on that figure (even ignoring the savings presented by taking less passengers (less luggage, less admin, etc)).<p>They&#x27;re charging too much.<p>> The airline industry is pretty competitive. If one doesn&#x27;t offer what you want, use one that does.<p>None of them do. They&#x27;re competing for 90% of the audience who aren&#x27;t tall, nobody wants a niche in that 10% of the market.<p>So they sell a &quot;premium&quot; product to people who want, don&#x27;t need, it. So they charge a premium price.<p>> Secondly, you&#x27;re just wrong about the cost. I picked a United roundtrip between IAD and SFO, and they want a whopping $84 for Economy Plus on the outbound leg, and $79 on the return leg, on top of a $414 base roundtrip fare. That&#x27;s $174 extra for the roundtrip, within the range you state as acceptable.<p>That&#x27;s a 50% increase which I stated was unacceptable. Let&#x27;s ignore fixed figures and say 50% is too much, period. That is too much and that is my point.<p>> For another example, I flew IAD-PEK on United earlier this year, and it was $200 each way for Economy plus, on a $1,400/person trip that takes 14 hours each way.<p>That&#x27;s a very interesting way of wording things. You use three techniques there to mislead, first you conflate single trip with round trip costs, secondly you are vague about if the $1,400 is the relative cost (of a normal economy ticket) or the new cost after you added in the Plus, and lastly you use a personal anecdote nobody can possibly verify.<p>So I won&#x27;t respond to that. No way I can argue with vague &quot;facts&quot; and unverifiable anecdotes anyway. Plus looking at the cost of flights your figures all seem inaccurate.<p>> Now, one might expect you to delighted at this, since apparently you didn&#x27;t know before, and it&#x27;s exactly what you asked for. Somehow, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to happen, though.<p>As you didn&#x27;t state the cost of the economy tickets along with the cost of the &quot;upgrades&quot; those figures are utterly meaningless as you well knew before you posted them.<p>You likely went and found the shortest cheapest flights you could, then noted the upgrade cost (e.g. $50 on a $100 flight) and used that as &quot;proof&quot; that upgrades are inexpensive.<p>But relative to the base ticket they&#x27;re not and that&#x27;s the only thing that matters. 50% is 50% is 50%. You can find a $100 ticket or a $5,000 ticket, if the cost is 50% more for the legroom (while offering less than 50% more space) then they&#x27;re over charging people who were born a certain way.<p>This is the last time I&#x27;ll reply to you as some fact checking in the above post as made me deeply distrustful of you and your motives. Frankly I don&#x27;t want to have a conversation with someone who will be intentionally misleading in this way.",1409166954

This is true because the variable doesn’t actually have a live range. Instead, the value is logically read from arbitrary registers that happen to be around when needed, so the value is not necessarily consistent over time.<p>An undefined value is both unspecified but also need not be the same unspecified value over multiple uses. This can result in surprising behavior when you&#x27;re reading code, where you tend to assume that even if the value of a variable is unknown, different uses of it will be consistent with respect to each other.",1409166453

Any thing is possible, sometimes the requirements to get there are so difficult the solution becomes <i>effectively</i> impossible.<p>If you consider Google as an example, the roughly 1,500 people who are in the search and ads teams make all the money for the company. Everyone else is, rounded to the nearest billion dollars, a non-contributor. But rather than accumlate cash faster than the Federal Reserve can inject it into economy, they spend it on projects which might get them into other markets. Or sometimes create entirely new markets. But that gives them size. And at both Sun and Google its pretty clear that the Bozo Event horizon hits somewhere between 10K and 15K non-sales employees. I don't know <i>why</i> that is, just that it has hit there two times. If Jim's reading he can pitch in DEC's number.<p>I agree with you're assessment that there are always other growth strategies, and I can identify things that contribute to the incursion of bozos, but that is a long way from the experiment that can show a bozo free stable organization with growing revenue.",1345517479

Plus, in the other common OAuth use-case (backend to backend), if the consumer token is stolen, your client probably has a larger security issue on their hands that would have allowed the attacker to pose as them anyway.<p>This is interesting in that it may allow unscrupulous app developers to evade Twitter's new API limits by posing as the Twitter for iOS or Android applications, but I suspect these uses will not be widespread as Twitter can quite probably send a Cease and Desist to Apple or Google and have the offending app removed from the market.",1345517454

This, to me, is an easier way of thinking than attempting to place myself in the views of the thing I want to think about.<p>Moss enjoy the simple things in life, while rocks enjoy even simpler things. To me, these things cannot experience happiness - happiness is a human emotion that requires a memory of the past. Maybe a piece of moss 'remembers' the sun when the sun hasn't shined in a week. When the sun comes out again, it will be energized and start to grow. This would be the 'happiness' in a moss' life. A rock lays dormant until it can find a point of lowest energy to fall to, in which case it does. I think that's all there is to say about rocks though, because they don't seem to do much else. But what about rocks before? They came from lava, maybe they were spewn from a volcano, hurled hundreds of feet in the air before landing and solidifying. To me, if I were a piece of rock, I would prefer flying through the air (maybe when people throw rocks, they allow the rock to relive its previous life as a hunk of lava).<p>There are a couple things that you may run into trouble with when thinking about experience - humans have an innate sense of time that we base things off of. We have a certain number of experiences in a day, and that's the time frame of our experiences. What if experiences could be drawn out over hundreds, thousands, millions of years? What if suns experienced things on the time frame of hundreds of millions of years, what kind of experiences would be possible?<p>One (of many) more things to ponder that's inline with this type of thought - the effects of networks on consciousness. Because I have a consciousness, does that make every cell in my body conscious? If every cell is conscious, does that make every organelle? Does that make every strand of DNA? Does that make every atom in my body conscious? I would like to say no, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, and because of the configuration of things in my body, I have been allowed access to a consciousness. Maybe a moss can never experience anything, but moss is just a component of a forest. Maybe a forest could? Or are forests at the level of cells? Maybe an ecosystem could experience something?<p>A rock was likely once a piece of a boulder, can a boulder experience? What about sand, the rock's likely next change in configuration? What about a mountain, where boulders come from?<p>What changes when we step up levels of complexity?<p>(sorry for the randomness of this, I write as the questions pop into my head - where do those questions come from?)",1345516713

A 4-digit PIN with a 3 attempt lock-out (and no further information) is more secure than a 10 character password encrypted with MD5.<p>There will be people who say that it would all be fine if they just used bcrypt, but the fundamental problem is that if you don't use different passwords on every site, you're hugely at risk.<p>Consider a situation where you've given your ""trusted"" password to a site that you know does all the right hashing with password storage. Your super password is 20 characters of alphanums with specials and you're feeling pretty smug. You now hear that the site was hacked, but you're not worried as all they can get is the hash and let them just try brute-force, right?<p>Wrong. They hacked the site. They changed the login form and grabbed your password in plaintext. A hack means that they compromise part of the infrastructure. At this time it's sufficient to just grab database data. Changing presented HTML is possibly a little harder as it needs to stay up for longer, but if someone has access to the database, they probably have access to a whole lot more. This is why lastpass.com is less secure than storing your password database yourself.<p>TL;DR: make your passwords different.",1345516573

These tasks can be anything from helping write a paper, or debug some android code, from friends and other users who are willing to reward you for your help. Identify and make use of your skills, and get rewarded in return. Make an effort, and go get what you wanted.<p>why wishTabs?<p>when it comes to time and talents, every one is equally rich by 24 hours a day and a handful of talents which may very well be under-utilized or stamped upon as hobbies. wishTabs lets your friends, family and others in your network use your skills, and give you tasks to do that they may be needing help with. You can pick the right offers, complete the tasks and get the reward. They benefit from what you did for them, and you are rewarded for that. There is no more posting a wish and waiting for someone to get it for you. Earn it with your own merrit.<p>How does wishTabs work?\nwishTabs lets you post anything you want, and things you can do,  things are good at. Share your wishtab on your social network and let others know about it. A potential granter (one who will possibly grant your wish) can ask you to do things you are good at.

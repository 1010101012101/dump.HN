It's a subtle - but important - distinction.<p>Facebook's decision-making will increasingly be driven by thinking like ""how can we monetize all this wealth of consumer data"" or ""how can we introduce tiered fanpage packages to business customers as a revenue stream"" rather than focusing on what makes a great user experience.<p>Currently, knowing that my friend has achieved another 'badge' in Mafia Wars adds zero value to my life. It only gets worse as Facebook focuses more and more on business brands. What do I care if my friend 'likes' Apple or Nike? How does that improve my relationship with that person? People I am <i>really</i> friends with in real life don't care what brands I like, or what isotonic sports drink I drink. The like me because of <i>me</i>. Much as businesses would like to think that people define their lives by the products they buy (this is like the opening scenes in 'Fight Club' where Edward Norton's character tries to pick out stuff from an Ikea catalogue that defines himself) that's not a basis for a relationship. And Facebook used to be all about relationships. Now I look at my Live Stream...and it's got all this random flotsam floating downstream. I care about none of it.<p>The reason I love HN, incidentally, is because it's the polar opposite of MySpace and what Facebook is gradually becoming. Real people, that I share a lot in common with, expressing their real opinions, no auto-generated crap, and zero bling.<p>You see comments like ""What could cause FB to die?"" here on HN. They're so big at this stage, with the power of network effects and lock-in, that external competition is no threat to them realistically. The only way they will die is if they continue exactly the way they are now, making people's experience ever-more spam choked, till people realize ""hey this experience is actually quite shit, even if I do have 500 online friends"" and start looking for alternatives. We're not quite there yet though.",1282560853

Context switching between Dvorak and Qwerty is hard for me<p>2. It is optimized for English ... I also do lots of typing in my native language too, and there is a Dvorak layout optimized for my native language, but it has differences ... and context-switching is even harder because of the similarities.<p>In contrast, the Qwerty layout for my native language just replaces 5 symbol keys near Enter/Backspace with the needed diacritics. All other keys stay the same ... i.e. it's just an extension of the US layout.<p>3. Qwerty gives me plenty of confort. I'm only doing something like 80 WPM ... I don't need more than that and it's a confortable speed for my hands (if I'm going to get RSI from that, then Dvorak wouldn't be much of an improvement)",1282558272

Facebook is now the default, it's full of crappy games & dodgy ads. Every shitty website has a like button. It's has an irremovable reputation for a lacadasical approach to user privacy. Everyone and their grandmother are on there, FWD:FWDing Glen Beck nonsense and Farmville requests.<p>Every market has stratification, we define ourselves by our brand associations. There is a hole where there should be the Mercedes, the Apple of social networks to Facebook's Dell.  All that's needed now is something new to come along that woos the elite and Facebook's long term fate it sealed. There's a chance it'll be Disapora but there's a very good chance it won't.<p>That's not to say it won't be around for years to come but it has, to used a hackneyed phrase, jumped the shark and the difference is that Facebook's value comes from it's userbase, not its services or technology. Once the top end start bailing the rot will set in fast, momentum shifts with dizzying speed on the web. I've been thinking about this for a while, I figure if I'm right, I'll be able to point to this in a year or two and smile.

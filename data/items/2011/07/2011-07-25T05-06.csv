2801521,comment,2801033,2801396,10,0,aik,,,"Appreciate the analysis, however I believe you made a fairly significant error with the solar capacity percentage. Unlike other solar power, the cool thing about this structure is that it doesn't specifically require constant sunshine to work effectively being that it works off the temperature differential through the tower, rather than pulling energy strictly from solar panels. Because of this, I would imagine capacity to be much nearer to 100% than the opposite.<p>""for every hundred metres you go up from the surface, the ambient temperature drops by about 1 degree. The greater the temperature differential, the harder the tower sucks up that hot air at the bottom - and the more energy you can generate through the turbines... Because the heat of the day warms the ground up so much, it continues working at night;""<p>As for how the difference in temperature between the surface and 100s of meters in the air changes throughout the day/night, I don't know.<p>So according to your equation, at 80% capacity, it could cover 128k homes. At 93.3% capacity it'd reach 150k.",1311573428

So I shot that idea in the head prior to launch.  (I still use the domain for an HTTP proxy.)<p>Then later I started work on WidgetBakery.  You know widgets, those lovely little embeddable Javascript/etc code pieces that you create so other people can promote your website for you?  I thought it would be cool if you could do that without being able to program, so that e.g. a laundromat or plumber could have their own widgets, thus getting them qualified traffic and improving their SEO.  I did not talk to any laundromats or plumbers prior to coding it, naturally.  When I finally started talking to people after half-building it, I realized that all of my customers were going to be black hat SEOs in seedy industries (payday loans and the like), and that it was highly likely Big Daddy G would nuke my site from orbit within a matter of weeks or months from launch.<p>So, that's a few months of dev time and a few thousand dollars of investment (VPSes, designer time, etc) that I won't get back.<p>Appointment Reminder also has been lagging expectations, but I still have hopes (and better, a plan) for that one.

In particular:<p>- ""Because it works on temperature differential, not absolute temperature, it works in any weather""<p>- ""Because the heat of the day warms the ground up so much, it continues working at night""<p>- ""It requires virtually no maintenance - apart from a bit of turbine servicing now and then, the tower ""just works"" once it's going, and lasts as long as its structure stays standing""<p>If these claims are true, then it would make sense for this plant to have a much higher capacity factor than most solar plants given that the major factors lowering CF is mitigated in this design (works at night and no shutdown for maintenance). Maybe I'm stuck in CS land where we think by factors of 10 but the numbers in this article doesn't seem too far off the beaten path.",1311572914

If want someone to know some optimization and have a good reason for this, then fine.  Then, cover some good material on optimization.  But evaluating people on trivia about optimization as in Skiena is silly and arrogant, uninformed, dysfunctional, destructive, etc.  It's something from the Queen in Alice in Wonderland:<p>""They didn't review Skiena?  They don't know dynamic programming?  Then, off with their heads!"".<p>At the level of Skiena, f'get about optimization.<p>Again, Google is showing that they are far too centered on 'computer science' where they accept low quality material just because it was hijacked from its real origins in various fields of applied mathematics into a book on 'computer science' and poorly presented there.<p>For the network simplex algorithm, about the most elementary case is the transportation problem where find a least cost way to ship widgets from several factories to several warehouses.  Then generalize to a network.  Then, a simplex algorithm linear programming basis is just a spanning tree in the network.  To add a variable to the basis, add an arc from the network.  Then the spanning tree will be converted to a network with a circuit.  Then run flow around that circuit in the direction that reduces cost until the flow on some arc hits zero.  Remove that arc from the basis and again have a spanning tree.

It's a new project, new development without any clients at all. Personally, I would rather give too much flexibility and wind it back after a while than not give enough flexibility and have nobody use it because they can't configure it to their needs. The last thing I would want to have happen is for people to give up an attempt to use it because it isn't able to do certain things. That to me is not a protip if you're hoping that people will use it.<p>I wish I could post saying ""Hey this has been proven on ..."" but I can't, because it hasn't. My personal credibility has nothing to do with it at all. If you evaluate software purely on someone's credibility then you'd have barely anything to choose from.<p>For me, it's solving a problem that I have, and solving it quite well. From the feedback I've got elsewhere, others have felt the same and don't really have an issue with a typical XML configuration that you find in almost any .NET application.<p>While I appreciate the idea, I am not dumping the XML. It's idiomatic .NET configuration, and I am not going to fly in the face of this convention due to my, or any other person's, bias against XML.<p>You can specify the configuration through code, the XML-driven config is just one way that you can configure it.<p>I'm not sure which twenty lines of boilerplate you're talking about. I see 2 for configuration, and one to create a client. I don't see the redundancy, and I also don't see any of the configuration as useless. Each entry serves a specific purpose, and can be specified or left as a default (except for important properties such as host name). I don't believe that forcing hard-coding of configuration is a better option over XML, particularly in the ecosystem this library lives in.<p>> Read the rest of what I said.<p>I read it. Multiple times. And that was before I responded.<p>equark is saying that he doesn't want to write boilerplate code. You're saying that XML config is redundant and sitting around uselessly. I don't see those as the same thing.<p>If you don't work with .NET then obviously this library isn't targeted at you. Hence, feel free not to use it :)<p>Personally this difference of opinion is moot, as the configuration/wiring of settings is such a small part of the library. It is possible to configure it easily to fit your environment, even if it's 1 or 2 lines of code more than you'd like.<p>I'd be keen to hear what you had to say about the other 98% of the code. ie. The bit that actually does something interesting.<p>Thanks for the critique.",1311570468

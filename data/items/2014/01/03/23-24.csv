This includes fuel, initial purchase price of the drone (3k or so) and wear and tear.<p>In their system, they use elevated platforms where the drones could drop off packages/change batteries.

But let&#x27;s be honest and not hyperbolic about what the situation really is.  Again, I can&#x27;t speak for every nation, but in America our democracy undeniably has its flaws and shortcoming but there is nothing I&#x27;ve ever heard of that is realistically stopping a movement with enough political will from making a change.<p>But instead of disagreeing on semantics about &quot;real&quot; or &quot;pseudo&quot; democracies, what &quot;real power&quot; is, etc., I&#x27;d be interested to know how you, OP, or anyone else would answer these two straightforward questions.<p>1. What is it about the current democracy you live in that would need to change for it to become a &quot;real&quot; democracy?<p>2. If enough people were to work together to make that change a reality, is there anything that could realistically stop that change from happening?  (And I don&#x27;t just mean, you might get out-campaigned, I mean no matter how hard you tried nothing could be done.)<p>Not being able to change what is wrong is I think a fairly simple starting point for defining something that is not a &quot;real democracy&quot;.<p>The fact is, at least in the US any criticism of government that most people have is something that, if there is enough political will from the electorate, if you, me, and anyone else will knock on doors, talk to our neighbors, find candidates, run ourselves if necessary, can&#x27;t be stopped.<p>I know people often phrase questions as backhanded insults on discussion forums, but please know I&#x27;m being genuine when I say I would be excited to hear you or anyone else describe specifically what needs to change in government, and then explain specifically why it&#x27;s impossible for those changes to take place.<p>I believe any changes are definitely possible if the political will is there.",1388793008

My completely-unsupported-by-evidence hunch is that different lengths and types of software project do better or worse in silent environments (although I also suspect that the largest variance is from personal preference).<p>By way of personal anecdote, when I&#x27;m working in the games industry, coding teams tend to be very small and very cross disciplined, and the smaller the teams the more frequently code changes touch other devs because you&#x27;re often changing several systems across the engine throughout the day. In this environment myself (and co-workers - I did ask :) find non-silent, &quot;noisy&quot; environments work well. Incidental conversations and cursing are actually quite good ways to add interesting fluff to the games as they are being created, and cursing is a damn good barometer indicating that some of the APIs for my code is rubbish to work with.<p>Conversely, I&#x27;ve worked on more traditional things where I&#x27;m deeply involved in a rabbit hole of my own burrowing, and in those cases less noise does seem to help. In those cases I&#x27;m general solving very narrow and specific problems, and the APIs I&#x27;m offering to other devs (if there are APIs) are far more formally defined.<p>However, I&#x27;m likely biased. Unless it&#x27;s a very specific and very hard problem I&#x27;m trying to solve, I like some level of background noise to keep the useless parts of my brain occupied while the code bits do their stuff.

SSL/TLS is protocol which incorporates a suite of algorithms for authentication, key exchange and encryption.  So on that level, like the sibling comment mentions, they aren&#x27;t really comparable.  The part of the SSL/TLS protocol that really depends on the certificate is the authentication, though - Diffie Helmann can be done in the clear without compromising its security, and once you&#x27;ve established the key any algorithm can be used to encrypt.  When you revoke a certificate, you&#x27;re essentially saying that you suspect someone else may be able impersonate you on the internet, so don&#x27;t trust anyone authenticating with it.  The algorithm is secure, but the certificate is not.<p>The point I was trying to make is that if you suspect someone has compromised your certificate, you can revoke it to reestablish secure communications.

Tech has allowed some companies to run more efficiently; they make just as much money, but with fewer employees. As much as non-tech people love to poke fun at Instagram and Twitter for being useless, it&#x27;s the genuinely useful stuff we&#x27;ve created that has displaced workers.<p>It&#x27;s not like this is without precedent. Agriculture and the industrial revolution both fundamentally reshaped the nature of work, and it took some time for the system to reorganize to accommodate. We may be looking at something similar. Tech is going to displace even more employees as we continue to advance, and it&#x27;s not clear what these workers should do. They might seek training to fill some of the high-skill positions that can&#x27;t find candidates, but there are only so many positions like that. If the numbers I&#x27;ve seen are to be believed then there are more unemployed/under-employed than there are unfilled job openings. Either things will adjust and the job market will expand, or we may have to adapt to a world where not everyone is required to be part of the labor force for an economy to operate at peak efficiency.<p>I think the universal wage movement is an exciting development for that reason, but it seems politically impossible to get something like that passed in the US right now. Then again, 15 years ago I&#x27;d have called you crazy if you said the majority of the country would support gay rights by 2014.<p>I may be getting ahead of myself. It&#x27;s possible that there&#x27;s some new kind of product or service I&#x27;ve not conceived of that will come into existence and create many jobs. That would be nice, and it would solve the employment problem.<p>However, if that doesn&#x27;t happen and we continue to insist that people need to be employed if they wish to have food and shelter, then there are likely hard times ahead for many people. And it&#x27;s likely that the work we do will make workers less necessary in more fields as time passes, which hastens the problems.",1388791208

After building the bloom filter, the client XORs it with a fuzzing pattern [a].<p>(2) The server performs a logical AND of the received bloom filter and (its own bloom filter XOR another fuzzing pattern [b]), and sends back the result.<p>(3) The client XORs the result with the fuzzing pattern [a], and uses this bloom filter to perform the local queries.<p>(4) The client stores the differences in results between the subsequent results, and each time the same result is returned, it doubles the query interval [c].<p>(5) The client sends its own ID with each query, so as the network grows and the server inevitably needs to recreate the bloom filter with different parameters, it can do so gradually ahead of time from scratch just based on the IDs of the queriers.<p>[a] I haven&#x27;t done any napkin calculations of how random it should be, nor how many bits would need to be set to 1. The idea is to add a certain amount of false negatives here so the server were not able to recover the contact list just by bruteforce lookups. To avoid the leakage of information by correlating the subsequent requests, this pattern should probably be a PRF(client_contacts), rather than a purely random function - thus, if the contact list did not change, it should not change either, and if the contact list did change, it should change in a way to mask the change in the contact list somewhat.<p>[b] This may not be needed. The idea is to try to protect against the client sending an all-1 list and getting the entire bloom filter. But given that both [a] and [b] may both introduce false negatives and false positives, maybe there should be another approach to restrict what is sent to the client.<p>[c] Especially given the [a] and [b], chances are quite high that this might be a no-op.<p>It is obvious this method will introduce the false negatives, and if [b] is used, can add false positives as well.",1388791182

7008899,comment,7007828,7008648,42,0,tedkalaw,,,"Regarding returning things without a receipt:<p>Once upon a time, it used to be possible to get Bing points by playing a bunch of stupid games on Club Bing - you could accumulate at most 1000 per day, unless there was some sort of modifier (like &quot;double ticket day&quot;) site-wide. The prizes available for these points were usually older Microsoft products like old games (9.99USD), kitchen appliances, hammocks, cheap headphones, etc. The biggest prizes were Zunes, Vista, Microsoft Office, and the XBox360 Arcade Edition. As I recall, the XBox required some crazy amount of points and thus wasn&#x27;t worth it...and Vista and Office are hardly sexy items. You could win at most one of each prize per physical mailing address.<p>The games that you played to win points were flash games, so a bunch of bot writers automated this. They&#x27;d register multiple accounts and try to max out the number of points they could get per day. Since users had multiple accounts, people would maintain different amounts of points to save for the big ticket items. I believe that Office and Vista were in the 50,000 to 100,000 point range. (Side note: Microsoft was slow, but they DID actually deliver - I got a 360 controller for free!) There are forums dedicated to &quot;opportunities&quot; like these.<p>So, what do you do with a free copy of Vista Ultimate? Well, one day a user who had exhausted all of the other prizes tried going to Best Buy with his copy. He went to customer service, in-store, and said &quot;Hey, my grandmother got me this for my birthday. I already have it. Is there any way you could possibly help me out?&quot;<p>Can you guess what they did? They gave him $450 in Best Buy credit.<p>For awhile, the overarching Club Bing metagame was to simply farm Vista Ultimate, go to a different Best Buy, and &quot;return&quot; your copy. And, on top of that, someone discovered that Microsoft&#x27;s shipping treated &quot;123 N. Fake Street Apartment A&quot; and &quot;123 N. Fake Street Apartment Z&quot; (and, for that matter, &quot;123 N. Fake Street Apartment AAAA&quot;) as unique addresses - so it became possible to have multiple copies of Vista Ultimate shipped to your house. At one point there were so many Club Bing copies of Vista Ultimate floating around that you could go on forums and purchase it directly for $100 because botters had exhausted their local return options.",1388790483

Sketch looks neat but requires Mac OS 10.7 at least (my iMac is stuck at 10.6, my MBA isn&#x27;t suited for graphic design) and seems to suffer from numerous bugs. Macaw looks promising but is too much focused on code. And Fireworks is discontinued.<p>I use Illustrator from time to time, but only for <i>assets</i>: icon fonts, logos, or print-quality jobs. It&#x27;s not suited for layouts: there&#x27;s no grid, it&#x27;s difficult to export background images, you need to calculate a lot even for simple adjustments... Photoshop actually carries interesting vector capbilities, which I use for example to design icons that are both infinitely scalable and pixel-perfect (start small, expand appropriately).<p>Why is Photoshop still considered the n°1 web design tool?<p>- Web designers are mostly graphic designers first: they focus on the UI, and don&#x27;t know or care about the UX. They want to create Dribbble shots, not experiences.<p>- The community and online resources are huge, from simple forum signature tutorials to advanced realistic drawing techniques.<p>- Air-brushed billboard model? Funny image manipulation? Fake celebrity picture? Done with Photoshop. Everyone knows about it. It&#x27;s even a verb.<p>- Eye-candy sells. Clients don&#x27;t care about how their website will perform. They care about the &quot;Wow!&quot; effect. It&#x27;s something they can have an opinion on. And it&#x27;s not in the web designer&#x27;s interest to point out this fallacy.<p>I guess the article&#x27;s purpose can be summarized by its last paragraph, where it displays the drawing of an eye, made with only one Photoshop layer. What&#x27;s the purpose of this self-imposed constraint? The answer lies in the appended link&#x27;s destination: a Dribbble shot.<p>You <i>can</i> design interfaces in Photoshop, but most people (including me probably) only draw interfaces.",1388790459

Every Christmas, he would take them to hand out food at Head Start centers. Through their church, All Saints Episcopal in Beverly Hills, they traveled to Mexico to build houses for the poor&quot;<p>&quot;He laid out his case in a letter to his father on Feb. 12, 2008. He began by thanking his father for working so hard to afford &quot;such an amazing lifestyle,&quot; assuring him that he understood how privileged they were. &quot;We live in a bubble,&quot; Evan wrote.&quot;<p>&quot;But where he is a real outlier is in his attitude toward his own success. One of the cherished ideas of the tech world is that success is based on talent and hard work, and that everyone has an equal chance. But Spiegel, who grew up in a wealthy family, has little use for what he calls &quot;the myth of meritocracy.&quot; Where others see success as a function of effort, he sees it as luck.&quot;<p><a href""http://www.laweekly.com/2013-10-17/news/snapchat-evan-spiegel/full"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.laweekly.com/2013-10-17/news/snapchat-evan-spiege...</a><p>I would say these statements fly directly into the face of your characterization of Spiegel.<p>>I would be hard-pressed to find someone who thought Snapchat was actually useful to the world. Popular, yes, and fun too, but not particularly useful. Certainly not $4 billion useful. To turn down that amount of money means that Evan sees Snapchat as his primary priority. With $4 billion, Evan could easily fund multiple new startups that are doing meaningful work to change the world (or at least make money!).<p>Couldn&#x27;t you dismiss Facebook and Twitter with the same criticism? Who determines what is useful to the world? Enhancing communication isn&#x27;t the same as curing cancer, but I think you could argue there is some benefit from connecting people?<p>I&#x27;m not sure where you get that his refusal to accept a buyout makes him more out of touch. Do you think Zuck should have sold out at 1 billion to Yahoo so he could go build and invest in other companies? Isn&#x27;t there a Zuckerburg quote where he said if he sold Facebook, he would go out and build the same company again? Also isn&#x27;t it plausible to believe that Instagram sold out too early?<p>So why are you faulting a guy for thinking that his billion dollar company (which comes around very rarely) is his main goal right now?

Second of all, I really need to point out that there&#x27;s a big difference between convenience and flexibility, so our technical evaluations don&#x27;t really challenge eachother.<p>rsync might involve more work, but on the other hand you could have a cron scheduler trigger it at regular intervals, run by a script that only performs a backup under the right network connectivity conditions (eg. the phone is connected to your home or work WLAN). Perhaps you only want to back up part of the system, or maybe you want to back up some parts of it (say, /home) more frequently than others that are susceptible to big changes (/usr/bin?). Perhaps the only thing you really want to back up from your phone are your downloaded email attachements and browser downloads, while having your contacts managed by some cloud service. You&#x27;ve already listed the disadvantages of such a setup, and I agree, but the advantages need to be acknowledged as well. The stream-lined iOS approach might be as one size fits all as it gets, but there could still be cases where a user would reasonably want to handle it differently.<p>As for what use ssh for, you are being clear now. At first I thought you meant using an ssh client on the phone (in which case the answer would be the generic answer to &quot;what would I use ssh for?&quot;), but running an sshd on your phone could be useful as well. It&#x27;s a quick and convenient way to move files to it -- think binaries, scripts, crontabs or runit services -- and a quick way of managing these files.",1388790235

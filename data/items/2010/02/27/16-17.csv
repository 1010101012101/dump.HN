[EDIT: spurious word left over from an earlier version of the paragraph removed.]<p>Playing classical music in places where you don't want teenagers hanging about: obviously harmless, no? It harms no one; any teenagers who actually like classical music will just go there if they want to and not be traumatized; it's no different from choosing the music and decor in a shop to attract a particular demographic.<p>Using classical music as a form of punishment in school detentions: unlikely to do any very grave harm, but certainly bad for the cause of classical music since it encourages the pupils to think of classical music as bad.<p>Using classical music to accompany Pavlovian conditioning to break the will of a teenage criminal (""A Clockwork Orange""): obviously vile, though the main badness is in the conditioning itself; also, curiously enough, <i>not something anyone is actually doing</i>.<p>There's plenty to dislike about ""ASBO Britain"", but this is just bullshit.",1267286992

Simply by spending 15 minutes in the shower every day I will have wasted an entire year of my life in the shower. By sleeping in 1 hour on Sunday I wasted 1/2 a year of my life, equally anyone spending an hour in church also wasted a year of their life (unless on the off chance god exists, then they only probably wasted a year of their life worshipping the wrong god). Those two teeth cleaning's my insurance company covers per year, assuming I'm only in the average of an hour, I just wasted almost 7 days of my life despite no medical evidence the procedure does anything, but if I get the maximum done yearly, well that's 12 days.<p>Why should I brush my teeth the 2 minutes morning and evening recommended by my dentist? that wastes 81 days of my life. Just doing 1 minute morning and night only wastes 40 days. Why should I sleep the recommended 8 hours a night when just getting 6 hours has no appreciable difference on longevity or health? That's a whole 6 1/2 years saved if I just sleep 6 hours.",1267286739

I read it at a glance as <i>The author is calling on you asses to choose what you want to achieve.</i> A moment later I understood you meant <i>assess</i>, and while the two statements mean much the same thing, the one I misread is far more memorable :-)",1267286604

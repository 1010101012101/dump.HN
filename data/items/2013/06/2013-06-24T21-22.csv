Sirius has ~20M subscribers. He got paid  $181.94 for 179 broadcasts, or $1.02 each. Well, he&#x27;s only making more per listen if it reaches less than 0.3% of those subscribers (60K). Otherwise the Pandora model actually pays him more.<p>Pandora: $16.89 / 1M listens = 0.0017 cents<p>Sirius XM: $1.02 per broadcast / 60K listens = 0.0017 cents<p>If you get more listeners on Sirius, that per-listen payout goes down. With the Pandora model it scales proportionately.<p>He just has to keep in mind that Pandora is much smaller than radio right now and that&#x27;s why the absolute payout is small. It&#x27;s confusing for musicians when they see big numbers like One Million I guess. ;-)",1372111186

The current crop of online text editors has a similar impulse: &#x27;The app for people who just want to write.&#x27; What these apps&#x27; creators mean is that their apps strip down the experience to the bare essentials of the activity, and don&#x27;t throw a lot of extraneous bullshit in your face when you&#x27;re trying to get your reading/writing/weather-checking done.<p>Which misses the mark a little bit. If your interface is simply a recapitulation of the received wisdom around feed reading, or text editingif your app looks like what you&#x27;d get if you took all the feed readers that have been made and incorporated only those features that occur in all of themthen you haven&#x27;t achieved minimalism. You&#x27;ve achieved superfluousnessthe very thing you were trying to avoid!<p>Minimalism, as we should all know by now, isn&#x27;t simply <i>not including</i> features.

The text editing web app that sets my world on fire won&#x27;t be another Markdown-enabled text box that lets me go to full screen, it&#x27;s going to be a Markdown-enabled text box that understands my intention and fulfills it in ways that I, not being a brilliant application designer, have not yet imagined.<p>At the very least, if you can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t tout a new, whiz-bang feature, get me excited about what it is that you&#x27;ve cut away, what you&#x27;ve devised how to do without, to really deliver on the promise of simplicity (that is, simplicity of usenot design or construction) and essentialism. On the other hand, the promise of a wide range of features to come, many ideas to be implemented, seems to work directly against the header of this article.

I learned more in my first month at a &quot;big company&quot; than in the two years I spent in the startup world. I started out working for startups, and while it was fun at first, it was a big mistake. My development skills ended up stunted and patchy from churning out MVP after MVP. I never learned how to maintain or scale an application, since most of the time I was just pounding code as fast as I could, hoping to score more funding. Since most of my coworkers were also young and inexperienced, I learned little of value and picked up a lot of bad habits. Maybe I just wasn&#x27;t enough of a &quot;smart young person&quot; to pick ideal companies, but really, who is?<p>That&#x27;s just my personal experience, but my point is that startups don&#x27;t necessarily equal prime education. If you really want to learn and grow, find a team of disciplined people who understand and enjoy their work.

If failure means liquidating all assets, with investors losing most or all the money they put into the company, then the failure rate for start-ups is 30 to 40 percent, according to Shikhar Ghosh, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School who has held top executive positions at some eight technology-based start-ups. If failure refers to failing to see the projected return on investment, then the failure rate is 70 to 80 percent. And if failure is defined as declaring a projection and then falling short of meeting it, then the failure rate is a whopping 90 to 95 percent.&quot; -

That is a fact.<p>EDIT: I would also like to add that only in the strictest and most painful sense was the legacy OpenGL &quot;just an abstraction&quot;. Before, it was a simplistic cross-platform layer over actual hardware and while abstract to a degree, hardly attempted to shield the programmer from hardware details. It&#x27;s notable that the features that OpenGL &quot;happened&quot; to include as the &quot;core abstract GL state machine&quot; mapped pretty much 1-to-1 onto SGI&#x27;s tiered hardware offerings at the time. In other words, what made the cut was very much based on real hardware, hence, the evolution of the API was not based on random abstractions that seemed like a good design [cough]. The legacy-GL-on-modern-hardware -- we refer to it as &quot;fixed function emulation&quot;, since the abstraction is so far removed from actual hardware nowadays. Perhaps this isn&#x27;t a &quot;good reason&quot; to change the abstraction, but it is notable that if the <i>entire</i> legacy API can be emulated using the newer API, then the legacy API may not deserve to be part of the driver (which takes a lot of time and effort to develop) so much as another library. That is to say, if one were to change it into terms of &quot;computability&quot;, there are some things that cannot be computed using the FF, but the reverse is not true, i.e. FF can compute a proper subset of the programmable pipeline. In fact, this is pretty much the exact idea that Gallium takes in Mesa -- and why you can implement D3D / GL ES / core GL / legacy GL on top of it.<p>Now, on to the real issue that I raised, which is a purely API design choice. Direct state access vs bind-modify-unbind. The consequences of bind-modify-unbind have been lamented by developers for _ages_. As a response, the newer GL sampler objects do not use that. However, the old style API (you know, the thing we&#x27;ve been lamenting over for ages) does not have a modern equivalent. Please tell me how this has ANYTHING to do with GPUs?

That sucks.<p>Maybe the license fees go more to groups above the artist that don&#x27;t deserve it, maybe Pandora&#x27;s operating expenses eat up most of the pie... I don&#x27;t know who to blame for the situation, I just know it&#x27;s rigged against the people actually creating the music.<p>And this is why pirates don&#x27;t feel bad about copying music.  When it is damn near impossible to consume music without 99% of the cost going to the distributors, why should anyone feel bad using distribution systems which don&#x27;t charge?<p>Buy physical music from local shops and go to shows and buy tickets from local distributors.

Services like Pandora, Spotify and even iTunes are really better in nailing down real listens and tracking much better (who knows how many true listeners there were really in the past other than Nielsen type predictions) but also there were less avenues to get content so it was more valuable to get on there.<p>It is the same problem in games with the previously distinct console markets where you can get more per game because there are less options.  Now there are tons of options and it is about bigger user base at a lower per sku revenue take.<p>The internet based services are more open and there are more of them vying for your attention (which is good) but that you need to do more amazing things to stand out than before.<p>The controlled markets like radio, movie distribution, consoles (sort of -- Xbone from next gen) since they are controlled/limited and the costs are higher to get on them, they to get bigger takes.  But they aren&#x27;t necessarily better.  Many artists, movies, games aren&#x27;t seen on those or would even be possible if they were still tightly controlled and limited markets. It doesn&#x27;t make it easier to succeed, it adds more competition and they end up being bigger markets but there is less exclusivity to it.  In the end this is good I believe but artists that would never have been seen for instance can now actually be seen at least in access and not locked out.

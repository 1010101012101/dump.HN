9554727,comment,9553494,9553494,0,0,hibikir,,,"Death Note would have been an extremely boring comic if Light had been smart or a bit ruthless. Given how easy disinformation is with a death note, it&#x27;d not be hard to hide the fact that he existed for years, and even after someone figured it out, to make it almost impossible to figure out his location. Nobody is getting bits of information about you if they don&#x27;t know you exist.<p>So what we get in Death Note is a calamitous lead character that has to make middle schooler mistakes, that then suddenly develops some smarts: It&#x27;s the only way to make the net grow close early on, but then withstand a few more books. But even with the whole second kira twist and all of that, it&#x27;s very hard to make the story coherent, and kira not get caught very quickly after making the mistakes that are mandatory to make the story any fun. Ultimately, Ohba has to rely on making L also act in pretty suboptimal ways, just to make the first arc of the story last long.<p>Which brings us to how Death Note is a good example of why it&#x27;s so hard to make realistic crime stories: It&#x27;s very difficult to make a story long enough to not be trivial, and yet have the criminal get caught in the end: It&#x27;s far easier to make a very good criminal or a hapless one than to make one that will move the story along at a good pace.",1431741536

Distro CDs shipping with it, game museums having MAME cabinets set up, etc. Playing word semantics is just going to annoy people not already steeped in the FOSS world.<p>(for what it&#x27;s worth, I also agreed to relicense my code that&#x27;s inside MAME to GPLv2 for this new effort, so please don&#x27;t consider me an enemy of GPL or anything.)",1431741311

9554690,comment,9552927,9554137,0,0,icodestuff,,,"Bizarre, but to be fair, I distinctly remember watching a version of Star Trek Generations in theaters which was apparently never released in theaters - it included the full scene of Soran torturing Geordi, and explaining the nano probe (so Dr. Crusher&#x27;s explanation of removing it actually made sense), the last fight scene going differently (Kirk escaped the breaking bridge only to get shot in the back and fall onto it, causing it to fall with him), and the missile flying into the ground instead of exploding. But I know this wasn&#x27;t just mentally interpolating the deleted scenes I saw later, because it didn&#x27;t include the orbital skydiving scene, for instance, and I remember on watching the VHS being very confused that the torture scene was missing.<p>The only remotely reasonable explanation I&#x27;ve come up with, besides sliding between universes, is that my dad and I actually went to a test screening instead of the actual theatrical release, but I think the last time I asked my dad about it, he _didn&#x27;t_ remember those additional scenes, and there&#x27;s no reason that a test screening should have been happening in my hometown. Another less likely explanation is that the theater was shipped a test screening print rather than what was actually released.

The issue was that Lucas was unable to secure appropriate relationships with banking partners such that the product could actually launch to the mass public until the end of 2014. Both attempted banking partners had extreme restrictions on the number of users allowed on the system until their legal teams signed off on it (due to the timely influx of new regulations from the CFPB), and both times this took more than 9 months to go through their bureaucracy.<p>Even while these public-launch-restrictions were in place, obviously it was possible to demo investors on the real product that moved real money between real bank accounts using real ultrasound technology to buy from real merchants, etc. These features were all also in beta tester hands.<p>As far as why investors were willing to invest in the product.. that&#x27;s its own discussion that I don&#x27;t feel like typing up at 6:30 on a Friday.

Most of the time, it wasn&#x27;t even close to being a bottleneck--most of the time the branch is correctly predicted and the time is just spent copying bytes for the `Ok` value, which is basically a nonissue if you can keep your error word-sized unless you&#x27;re calling a tiny function in a tight loop that LLVM can&#x27;t inline for some reason.  OTOH, landing pad generation in Rust probably doubles its compile time, which is already pretty slow (which is one reason I personally will probably just compile with panic! -> abort, when that option becomes available).<p>I don&#x27;t consider the error handling boilerplate because I do frequently want to recover, even from supposedly fatal errors.  For example, if I&#x27;m handling an iterator of things, and some of them fail, I still usually want to keep processing them before I return the error.  Exceptions lock you into a very rigid pattern of error reporting that make that much more difficult to deal with.  Because libraries don&#x27;t <i>assume</i> that I want to fail when they do, it can be easy and fast for me to do this, even for pathological inputs; that wouldn&#x27;t be the case if everyone used exceptions.<p>I agree with you that Rust could do better at providing options for error reporting with panic.

A lesson I&#x27;ve learned the hard way is to never let your sense of greed impair your judgment, especially around the relative certainty of success of a startup. A stupendously well-funded startup indicates only that the founders are good at fundraising, not that they&#x27;re good at building a product or a company.",1431738965
9554608,comment,9552495,9552495,0,0,bronz,,,"I was a very dedicated supporter of VR from 2012 to 2014. Unfortunately I have come to the conclusion that VR will flounder, especially in the coveted &quot;seated experience&quot; category. When the DK2s began to land on the doorsteps of developers and fans, feedback began to pour into the forums. There are two kinds of people: there are people who do not get simulator sickness and those who do. After reading the feedback and stories regarding the DK2 I realized simulator sickness was a much larger problem that I thought, and that it wasn&#x27;t going to disappear with better tracking, pixel density and refresh rate. Some people simply cannot tolerate VR, and I doubt that even the CV1 will be able to change that. But these are only the people at the extreme end of the spectrum, there are many others who straddle the boundary between being sick immediately and never feeling sick at all. The problem for people on the fence is that lateral movement in the game world is a major trigger for nausea. If your virtual body accelerates from standing to running, your real body expects to feel a sensation of acceleration. What this means is that if you move around too much you get sick. And for people who don&#x27;t feel sick as soon as they put the head set on, movement is often the tipping point. This is a huge problem because there is no way to simulate that kind of sensation (within practical limits) and almost all of the VR experiences that people want to engage in involve moving around in some way.<p>This conclusion is based solely on rational observations, and it was arrived at in spite of huge optimism and engagement with VR and the VR community.",1431738948

The good kind, which means working hard to reach a goal. The not so good kind, which means working hard and doing some not so nice things to reach a goal. Finally, the bad kind, which involves doing anything to anybody in order to get something. There is a difference between the not so good and the bad kind. In the not so good you are trying to reach a goal. In the way, you might get lost or not notice that you are doing some things wrong. After all, it is not simple to keep track of how your decisions impact the world over the long term. I&#x27;m not trying to excuse anyone here. Just stating that good people with good intentions sometimes do things that hurt others without even noticing. The bad kind of hustle is the one where you dont care who gets hurt or what gets broken. It does not take into account anybody but you. Always do your best to huslte the good way. Keep track of how your decisions affect others. Make a point about reaching goals in more than one way, i.e., not only financially, but morally and/or socially.<p>The good kind of hustle is the one you see baseball players do all year long. They train hard. They play hard. Above all, they go out to do their job as its supposed to be. All while giving fans something positive to look forward to. :)",1431738920

9554594,comment,9549963,9552840,0,0,KajMagnus,,,"You mentioned fewer bugs, and indeed I feel that Scala is safer than Java (fewer bugs). Some reasons: 1) Scala has named parameters, so you can avoid bugs related to parameters placed in the wrong order (simply specify the parameter name, if you have more than one of the same type). And 2) when you code in Java, you&#x27;ll have to read and write more code = higher bug risk. (But I wouldn&#x27;t want to write super concise code in Scala, that could also mean higher bug risk.) And 3) Scala doesn&#x27;t suffer from null pointer errors (assuming you use Option/Some/None).

First, it&#x27;s a slideshow, so there need to be some posts about right arrows and general complaints about scrolling (as if Eich created this content himself to post to HN, instead of to be a speaker aid for himself). Second, it&#x27;s about Javascript, so a bunch of people who really love lambda syntax and significant whitespace are going to show up and talk about how much better the web would be if we all ran python in the browser.<p>I think the web would be a lot better if we just ran lisp in the browser. Heck, I think lisp is pretty much the answer to all our problems. But nobody ever asked me.<p>As someone who was developing for the web in the (late) 90s, using web browsers and java as a cross-platform UI for educational software (mac and windows!) who tried to get java applets to communicate with each other (possible but difficult, and I ended up running a local java application that the applets RPCd to), I can say this with distinct clarity: the DOM and current (modern ES6) javascript system are pretty great. Sure, they could be better in some ways, but I don&#x27;t trust Joe Programmer (just for example here) to understand re-entrant code well enough to write stuff that actually works in a multi-threaded environment, so single-thread event-driven is great.<p>People complain about this binding and so forth, but it provides a great borrowing / mixin mechanism to the language that is just flat out impossible in other languages. The prototype inheritance system is funky, but es6 classes mean you don&#x27;t need to worry about it. If you want to, you can do some pretty rad metaprogramming with it, though.<p>Type coercion is kind of a pain, and frankly I&#x27;d love to be able to override operators (writing === semantics for objects over and over is kind of a PITA). But seriously, Javascript is pretty great. I pass around functions, chain together stuff with functional-based approaches (front-to-back no less), and can do all sorts of hip kinds of programming with it.<p>Maybe if we had some truly-different language driving the web, things&#x27;d be different, but don&#x27;t complain about javascript and just put forward python. Put something like haskell or smalltalk on the block. Let&#x27;s go big with the radical differences. I mean, c-ish languages are c-ish languages. I only wish CSS was as nice as Javascript. If I had my druthers, that&#x27;s where we&#x27;d be focusing; that and namespaces within the DOM (hello, shadow DOM!)<p>Okay, longpost over.

The opposite applies to shooting at an upward angle.<p>- Never face the camera straight on. You&#x27;ll look larger than you really are.<p>- Wide angle lenses (such as the one on a camera phone) will create barrel distortion. This is most noticeable towards the edges of the frame, so if you have enough resolution to crop it you can end up effectively faking a longer focal length.<p>- The best lighting is in the shade. A camera cannot capture the range of contrast you can see, which means it&#x27;s important to avoid huge variations in light and dark areas.<p>- Given a single light source for a headshot I will short light the subject. There&#x27;s a diagram here that illustrates the basic concept: <a href=""http://www.picturecorrect.com/tips/short-lighting-photography/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.picturecorrect.com/tips/short-lighting-photograph...</a><p>- Avoid distracting backgrounds. Wide angle lenses cannot achieve as much depth of field blurring as telephoto lenses can. This means that what could be an otherwise pleasing blur of colors with a long lens can be incredibly distracting from the central subject with a short lens.<p>- Don&#x27;t be afraid of some light editing.

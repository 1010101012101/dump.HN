I read about it in pg's essays and visited the website, but I didn't see any extreme usefulness in an application that ""shows you where your friends are."" However, if it is expanded to the point of making recommendations, then I can indeed see the brilliance. It's like expanding Web 2.0 into the real world, isn't it?<p>That's very cool. I see, now. Although I can indeed as well think of many privacy concerns with Loopt (which Sam has probably solved), I wonder if you could use it as an aid to finding stolen or lost phones? Many possibilities come to mind.<p>This just adds to pg's thesis: startups are almost never what they start as, but what their users need them to become.",1207525022

156495,comment,156177,156431,0,0,cturner,,,"Still, crux_ <i>is</i> playing the straw man, and it's risky to legitimise such comments. He is twisting his parent through bad interpretation to be a comment about what people 'deserve', and then develops this theme. So let me attempt to deal with that idea of 'deserving'.<p>What people 'deserve' is arbitrary, and extremely position sensitive. For instance - what if you were to phrase the education issue in terms of ""if somebody works part time and wants to pay to attend university to do extra subjects that are not provided under government university sponsorship, do they deserve to be allowed to do so?"" Or ""if somebody works hard and drives an old bomb of a car in order to save money to pay for a particular education for their children, do they deserve to be allowed to make that choice?"" Or, ""if somebody wants to spend five years sitting around smoking marijuana and collecting government benefits while failing to make any progress on the degree they're supposed to be doing, do they deserve government funding for this, when the opportunity cost for that choice hits poor people who have no interest in a university education but who can't get jobs due to the correspondingly higher levels of taxation required to fund such university places?""<p>The idea of what people 'deserve' is completely arbitrary. Ideas like 'deserve' and 'fairness' don't belong in public policy, except in reference to:<p>* direct application of the rule of law<p>* formation and honouring of private contracts<p>* ownership of private property (and that <i>excludes</i> anti-rights that are often mislabeled as property, such as ""copyright"")<p>These rules extend from the idea that you should be allowed to do what you like so long as you are not impinging on your neighbour. As 'mynameishere' says in the existing reply to this comment, the only way to guarantee other equality on other levels is to force some individuals to give up something for the benefit of expense of others.<p>And one of the side-effects of that sort of thinking is policy that acts against even the common interest. If you ban private schools so that everyone can be equal, that means people who would have put extra money into education (creating spaces in private schools and thereby removing demand form the public sector) instead spend it on improvements to their house or funding a more luxurious lifestyle. People who to improve education standards for poor people by abolishing private education need to think harder. And people who want to make everyone equal regardless of relative outcome need to have a look at Cambodia.<p>I'd like to return to another part of mynameishere's previous comment: ""We want to pay right-thinking, liberal arts majors middle class salaries for them to administer money distributions from functional people to dysfunctional people"". Governments tend to grow in a way that gives more work and power to the decision makers. This process is the enemy of individual freedom, and - as a general measure - fails on a utilitarian basis, also. If they don't have unambiguous facts to support what they're doing then they need to be blocked.",1207524875

Unfortunately it didn't reach to far into the digital age, but it was just good to get a broad sense of the arguments before delving into any new writings on the subject.<p>I also think I learned more in my Philosophy classes than my Comp Sci classes, but then I dropped out of the CompSci program and majored in Philo, so I am probably biased.<p>I'd judge myself better off than a significant number of technical majors that just were trying to get a good job after graduation. I had the benefit of a Liberal Arts school too, so I also took a lot of CompSci classes (How many Philo majors do you know that took Digital Electronics and had to build up an simple computer on a breadboard?).",1207524204

156489,comment,156137,156488,0,0,Tichy,,,"OK, I am not even sure anymore what the singleton pattern is _(it's been a while). If it is the class constructor that makes sure you can only ever create one instance, it might be bad. I thought any mechanism for ensuring singleness would qualify for the pattern. Then you examples wouldn't invalidate the connection pool, you could just have to different pools, one for each database. I agree that with the ""class instantiation implementation"" you could probably not do that.",1207524134
156488,comment,156137,156476,0,0,sah,,,"ConnectionPool is an excellent example of a bad case for Singleton: what if you have two databases?  What if you want to use different pools for different types of queries?<p>A global variable is different from a Singleton because if you write a Singleton class in some module that I want to use, I have to fork your module if I want to make it possible to use two of them.

Seriously, what happened with college preparing you for life? \nI think this country would be much better off if people start studying more concrete sciences.  Doing biology, math, physics, bio-chem, computer science, accounting... so we have the talent of actually solving real world problems, energy, polution, less co-2 emissions, alternatives to oil, better design and architecting of towns, less sprawl, etc.<p>How is a society going to advance with a bunch of people majoring in b.s.,  All they would be able to do is complain about how pollution is wrong to society, yet being unable to do anything practical about it.\nHow does a society advance with only people being able to talk the talk, but not walk the walk?<p>Studying Philosophy would be great if it is a minor, or a second major in school.

156476,comment,156137,156474,0,0,Tichy,,,"I must admit I can't remember when I have last seen it. I guess the usual case is the ConnectionPool for the database, which for most Java Web projects is being handled by the container (not sure how Rails does it). But in that case it does not seem the end of the world to have two connection pools. Somehow you have to still manage the whole picture, though... Maybe two are OK, but what if suddenly you have 1000 connection pools? Maybe then suddenly you start wishing you had restricted them to 1 from the start.<p>How is a global variable different from a singleton, anyway? Seems to me, in distributed and multithreaded environments the singleton problem is still a hard problem.",1207523337
156474,comment,156137,156467,0,0,sah,,,"Usually when I see Singleton used, what the author really wants is either a value that is cached after the first time it's created (so the correct pattern is ""cache""), or more often just a global variable.<p>What I find offensive about Singleton is the idea that that the author knows there is no context in which you might want more than one of some object.  This is especially bad in libraries, where having objects enforce their own uniqueness breaks the ability for me to use two FooManagers where the author only envisioned using one.  Designs are generally improved by accounting for the possibility of more than one instance, even if it isn't immediately necessary.",1207522887

The windows xp piracy rate ends up in a very low uptake of windows update, leaving quite possibly the largest population of vulnerable hosts in the world. Attacks end up being false-flag even if not intended<p>- Attacks that are genuinely Chinese in origin tend towards being citizen initiatives. Imagine if you lived in a jurisdiction where instead of being treated like Garry McKinnon for attacking American infrastructure, just nobody gives a fuck. The reverse also applies, but has a limit that Chinese is not widely understood by American 'hackers'. Any Chinese skiddie can cause an international incident by trying out their tools on an American company. Universities that run courses in infosec, of which some are military, are commonly accused origin IPs for attacks. The likelihood is that complacence, rather than official sponsorship or policy is the prime driver behind this phenomenon.<p>- Instead of trying to build out \cough\<i>\</i> cybercommands, Government sponsored CTF tournaments identify and reward talent, without bringing it on-board the National Security apparatus. Talent is left out in the community on the understanding it can be found if needed.<p>- The 'Chinese Government' is nowhere near as cohesive and controlling as is depicted in Western sources. Government sponsored economic espionage activities that are out of proportion to American efforts against the rest of the world will originate at the provincial level. Chinese industry is very regional, with whole provinces specializing in specific industries, hence the benefits of economic espionage is highly regional in nature too. It is not in the central government's interests to sustain the Chinese hacker folklore, nor would it be within their ability to rein in any provincial government involvement.",1361246174

There's a poverty trap because the economic system needs a poverty trap to function.

Well it could be the legacy of the New Deal and progressivism, although that would not explain massive poverty in slums and rural areas at the end of the 19th century in the U.S.  It could be due to a liberal idea of a lack of caring - although the New Deal, the Great Society and so forth brought a lot of focus on these things.<p>Or poverty can exist because it is a necessity, a cornerstone of the economic system.

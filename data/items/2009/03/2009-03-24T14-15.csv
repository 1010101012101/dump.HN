530212,comment,529352,529758,0,0,jerf,,,"There are already five answers as I write this, but I find I still want to add my point: Building social capital. If you ever need the community to help you, or even just <i>want</i> the community to help you, you need to put some time in first.<p>This can manifest in small ways. I have a small little driveway and a lot of sidewalk. My neighbors will often snowblow my sidewalk for me after a storm, which I appreciate. (I am legally obligated to clear the sidewalk, my driveway I can do at my leisure.) They get cookies and kudos. Another neighbor just came over and helped me trim my apple tree. They will get some apples and we'll make some applesauce for them next fall. When my pets get out, people know where to return them. We've gotten rides from our neighbors when our car was suddenly undrivable, and an we once performed an emergency babysitting. We've cared for pets while their owners were away on short notice.<p>When the assholes across the street moved, nobody cared, because they contributed nothing to our little local cul-de-sac but loud, vaguely dangerous children that ran around a lot. (Others have children that run around a lot, but without the menace.) There's another asshole who moved in more recently who has done nothing but make withdrawals on their social capital, and now nobody wants to talk to them since they never reciprocate and every conversation seems to wander into something they need. (If they don't need anything, they will simply ignore you if you say hello.)<p>None of these things are major, but it is often the little things that help. More extremely, you just never know when a job or something will pop up. It's less targeted than networking at a user group, but it can happen.<p>Bear in mind as I say this that I am fairly asocial. My wife ends up doing a lot of this quite naturally. But I at least support her in it. Also, my kid is only seven months old; I'm sure as he reaches school age my involvement will be even more interesting to talk about. We deliberately moved into an area with a lot of community activities for children and parents.<p>Oh... and this is the dreaded ""suburbs"", where I have found a better, more cohesive community than any city location I've ever lived in. But, not only ""may"" your mileage vary, your mileage <i>will</i> vary.<p>(Geography matters more than I realized. We chose a house in a ""court"", which is a little stubby road that has ten-ish houses on it that all face each other. I think that natural geographic division helps a lot. I bet the rows of houses on the main road have a much more diffuse community because there are no natural boundaries. In this aspect, perhaps my little chunk of suburbia is more village-like than some others.)",1237906613

We use a mixture of BSD, LGPL, GPL and EPL licenses depending on products. I have to say that BSD makes a lot more sense when you are selling to businesses. We have never had anyone take code closed on us, but we have found much more acceptance in B2B sales with using a BSD license rather than a GPL license. For us, it is a matter of survival to not use the GPL. And then the main code base moves forward with our paid developers doing about 70% of the work and the community doing 30%.<p>On the other hand, if your primary concern is starting a project with no intention to sell it, I would go with the GPL to prevent a company from shanking your idea.

If it ever became a major currency, it's price would sky rocket as it would have to absorb a huge amount of new monetary demand. Thus gold's current price fluctuations are basically a bet on the demise of Bretton Woods II.  But if gold ever became an official currency, it's price would shoot up and then stabilize.  After stabilizing its price would be more stable than any other form of currency.  Gold has the lowest flow to stock ratio of any good, so its a perfect nash equilibrium as a currency.  And empirically, the classical gold standard from 1865-1913 had much greater price stability than we have now.",1237905675

530157,comment,529407,530056,0,0,unalone,,,"There were a few elements here that I haven't seen in other block puzzle games: playing it through, a few things struck me as very unique.<p>First off, the nature of the gameplay is inherently submissive. That means that rather than trying to destroy things, you <i>change</i> them. Unlike most puzzle games, where the goal is to clear the way, in this one you can't <i>just</i> clear things. You're also converting everything around you.<p>It's also different in that it doesn't force you to speed. In some ways it's tactical, only the pieces are random, so your careful thought can't extend too far. The closest thing I can think to compare it to is Solitaire, where you don't know what's coming up in the deck but by taking your time, you can do slightly better.<p>The real subversive thing is how the game ends: once all you have left is grey, you're essentially in an endgame where you can't help but lose. That was unexpected, the first time I played, and it strikes me as a bit existentialist - fascinating for me because I never thought of gameplay mechanics as at all philosophical, but this one showed me that it's possible even with a block puzzle game. That also makes the game a bit calmer, and it adds an inherent limit to how long the game goes on for. That in turn favors the slower, calmer players, since you <i>can't</i> get a high score without being clever in how you play.<p>I don't know if I'd have noticed all that without playing Rohrer's game <i>Passage</i> first, but after playing <i>Passage</i> some of these things stand out in pretty sharp relief.<p>There's also a fascinating Rohrer interview about it, here: <a href=""http://wireless.ign.com/articles/956/956026p1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wireless.ign.com/articles/956/956026p1.html</a>",1237904437

530135,story,,,5,2,jayamohan,"What are the most challenging problems in the world today?",,"What are the biggest problems of our society today?<p>Insofar as mathematics or natural sciences are concerned, one can easily identify unsolved problems. But, what about
social sciences and our daily life? The answers may remain rather subjective and/or elusive. Below I have given a set of 
problems that look serious to me personally in the order that the problems that are vague and least certain which could also be 
solved in the near future in the bottom (5) to the obvious and most certain or whose solution(s) is unknown as yet on top (1) 
in the list.<p>5. Knowledge Management:   
     Every society advances through sharing and 'proper use' of the knowledge it gained from experiences.
     (For example, Using nano-robots to construct machines and buildings would be a proper use, but using them as a weapon of mass destruction is 
     an improper use of knowledge.)
     We have sufficient knowledge (or accumulating knowledge sufficient to meet the problem) of how to eradicate diseases, eliminate poverty, avoid 
     natural disasters etc; but, how effectively are we applying those to the real world? Very poorly. It is probably a cliche that saying ""education is 
     the silver bullet"". True, we all know that. But the problem is not only with people being unable to get education, it is with system of how eduction
     is provided that needs a radical upgrading.<p>4. Inequalities:     
     By inequalites, I mean all inequalities of such nature as power, economic/income, technological, and resources. Crimes and wars are the most 
     pampered children of inequalities - a fleeting glance in history will prove this. People have almost always fought for resources; one can 
     look back in any age in the written history and one will find a story of a higher power invading an inferior one, there is always one big guy who 
     is running the show and everyone else plays the passive role. This deprives people of freedom and thus prevents the creation of value. Too much   
     power and capabilities unevenly and unfairly distributed in too few people naturally engenders trouble. An emerging multi-polar, cooperative world 
     could possibly be a solution.<p>3. Lack of Cultural Competence & Tolerance:    
     Arms Race, Terrorism, Discriminations and the like have their origins in cultural misunderstandings for the most part. The spreading of 
     organized religions and other types of propaganda is the major contributor to almost all violence, unrest and ignorance in the world. 
     Tolerance is not only of importance in sustaining peace, but a necessity from an evolutionary stand point as well. We cannot expect highly 
     bureaucratic governments of all nations to take the necessary steps towards the goal of achieving a unviersal brotherhood, but cultivating a 
     cosmopolitan culture will enable this.<p>2. Energy, Degradation of Environment & Natural Resources, and Climate Change:   
     One cannot overstate the importance of wise use of resources. Things such as energy, water and land are finite, but most people, particularly in 
     the developed world, behave as though they weren't and price is paid by everyone. Negative externalities resulted by careless and selfish use of 
     resources are extremely hazardous and irreversible,and furthermore cause countless unforeseen and unintended consequences due to the infinite chaos 
     in the world. Anyone can figure out what possible solution there is to this problem, so no need reiterating.<p>1. Overpopulation:   
     World Population is soon to hit 7 billion. The reason overpopulation is the top problem is that it aggravates every other problem in this list.<p>Solutions:
The solutions indicated in the last sentences of problems assumes a normative view of the world, unfortunately that is not the state of the matters at the moment. But I, being an optimist believe we together can make differences. Extraordinary persons are always from ordinary people, not from elites. Although these goals are far-fetched in a short-term they are certainly attainable in the medium-to-long term that is within the next 25 or so years if only we act collectively and cooperatively.

I worked at a start-up that wanted to open source its code. Without the GPL, there would be no way it could do that, as a larger competitor could pick up the code base and out-market the company.<p>The GPL is what made it possible for that company to consider open sourcing its product. I'm sure there are other small companies like that as well. It seems like removing the GPL would only be beneficial to large companies (and, to be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the GPL, but I see its value).",1237903811

6426384,comment,6387080,6425551,1,0,4ad,,,"> How is that to the detriment of every contributor? They can simply opt out of using that driver.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t work like that. You can&#x27;t make driver X in the kernel GPL without making the whole kernel code GPL.<p>> You are trying to decide for those &quot;few&quot; people that they are better off without working drivers. Maybe some people do like having working graphic cards or working sound.<p>Aside from the fact that sound works better in FreeBSD compared to Linux (because of OSS4) and that graphics is at least on par with Linux (or better; the proprietary FreeBSD driver continues to work without recompiling the kernel shim every time the kernel is updated), you are completely missing the point. Some guy who complains on the Internet that FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t work on his laptop is of no value to FreeBSD. Valuable users are those who contribute code, those who run large installations, and those who use the code to build their products. These always take priority and every decision happens with them in mind, not random dudes on the Internet. You&#x27;re complaining about sound and graphics? I&#x27;m having a hard time believing this is a serious discussion, why not complain about the lack of sound and graphics on a PIC32 microcontroller.<p>> FreeBSD has a linux compatibility layer, which mean they can often run said GPL drivers through its port system.<p>No, this is impossible. Linuxemu is a compatibility layer for Linux user-mode binaries. It emulates the Linux system call interface. It cannot be used with Linux drivers. As mentioned above, the driver model is very different between different operating systems.",1379845669

The kind of person who enjoys an academic career may not enjoy a software development career because the activities and values involved are rather different.<p>I moved from academics (freshly graduated computer science PhD) into software development four years ago and when I did I had to answer a lot of questions about why I wanted to make the move.<p>My experience is of course not universal but I think that career trajectory is a big part of senior interviews once it&#x27;s been established that you can do the job.  It&#x27;s a broader issue than just academics vs industry.  No matter what field you&#x27;re in, you have to sell you your career transitions as &#x27;make sensing&#x27; to the jobs you&#x27;re applying to.

So the maximum &quot;Weev&quot; could earn is 165 days. He has already been in seg once for rules violations so it&#x27;s unlikely he would get the full 55 days, at least for this year.<p>He would be eligible for a halfway house; in his case that would be within three months of his mandatory release date.<p>So in any case he is going to spend more than two years in a federal prison. Doing time is not easy if you fight the prison system, and according to reports this is what he has been doing.<p>His sentence also undoubtedly contained a supervised release provision. So if he violates the conditions of his release (probably no computer use, that&#x27;s a standard one) he goes back inside for the duration of the supervised release period.<p>Federal prison is no joke. There are very good reasons to appeal.",1379844323

It makes sense if you look at the scene from above, like an architect a floor plan - world-space X and Y map to screen-space X and Y, and Z is then the depth. In a 3D virtual world, on the other hand, the perspective is usually of a person embedded in the world, in which case &quot;Y is up&quot; is more intuitive.",1379844062

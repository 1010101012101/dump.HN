The added expense is claimed to &quot;keep consumers away&quot;, but really it means things like solar panels become more useful.<p>If you are able to charge your car via power you generate and it can supply enough power back to run your home, you can get some huge benefits. You can have power at night that you generated during the day. No need to suck power from the grid. During outages, you would likely still have a few days of power. And finally, if we actually take full advantage of this, our power infrastructure could directly use these cars to distribute and store energy and route around outages, increasing stability in a huge way.<p>All in all, this could usher in an era of crowd-sourced power generation. One of the primary reasons that hasn&#x27;t been feasible was the ephemerality of power on the grid. You consume it just after it&#x27;s produced. We have no good way to store it. But with hundreds of thousands of 85kWh capacity batteries plugged into the grid, we suddenly have a start.<p>I think paying an extra $20,000+ for a car if that&#x27;s a potential outcome is worth every penny.",1393638518

I&#x27;d never say something like vim couldn&#x27;t do that, but sublime (for me) made multiple cursors seem intuitively powerful and useful, in that I could perform quick operations in seconds that I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to perform in that way before.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s similar to me if you were to compare regex find/replace with normal find/replace.  It&#x27;s a more powerful/flexible idea.  Whether or not it&#x27;s a good one is up for grabs.<p>That said, the speed does sound like it could be a problem.  I just don&#x27;t think power text manipulation is referencing processing efficiency.<p>I&#x27;m wondering how the efficiency of this setup is played out in stuff like Light Table and Brackets, which seem pretty similar (I think the front end on those is just html?

I&#x27;m aware of two things he was involved in that were tangentially related to Bitcoin, and one that is more directly related to Bitcoin.<p>1. The Silk Road case. This is only tangentially related to Bitcoin. The Silk Road defendants are in trouble for their alleged dealing in illegal substances and alleged involvement in murder-for-hire schemes. They would be in the same amount of legal trouble if they had been using any foreign currency for their transactions instead of Bitcoin.<p>2. The Charlie Shrem case. Also only tangentially related to Bitcoin. He is in trouble for allegedly purposefully participating in money laundering. He would be in the same trouble if he had been money laundering by exchange US dollars for Euros, instead of for Bitcoins.<p>3. The subpoena of Mt. Gox. We don&#x27;t know what action the prosecutors are considering, if any, since this is just a subpoena (basically, it means they want more information to figure out what, if anything, Mt. Gox might have done wrong). If Mt. Gox is eventually charged, it will almost certainly be for something like fraud or theft, although since the fraud or theft involved Bitcoins themselves, one could make a somewhat passable argument that at least this case is more than tangentially related to Bitcoin.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to make a rational argument that any of these are anti-Bitcoin, unless you think that the point of Bitcoin is to be able to money launder, commit fraud, and steal Bitcoin from other Bitcoin users who trust you to hold their coins for them.",1393637149

7322640,comment,7318061,7322321,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"Oh gee, that&#x27;s really a lot of fallacies.<p>Yes, people used the bank called MtGox in order to bet on the future of bitcoin, just as they use other banks in order to buy stocks of companies in order to bet on their future, often without having a clearly formed view on what the company will be doing in the future, and more often than not with the hope that some particular company will disrupt how a certain business is being done, sometimes even some financial business. That&#x27;s what we generally call financial capitalism. Just because you are betting on some not fully determined future does not make it a tulip bulb bubble.<p>Also, &quot;independence from regulation&quot; is not about &quot;not paying taxes&quot; or &quot;not helping other people&quot; or whatever your preconceptions might be, it is about achieving the same things that regulation is supposed to achieve, just without regulation. One major purpose of regulation is to make sure that a bank that you put your money in does not do overly risky things with your money so that you can be sure your money is still there when you need it. The value proposition of bitcoin is that the nature of the technology prevents the abuses in the first place, so there is no bank that could possibly do risky things with your money, so there is no need for regulation in order to keep it safe. Bitcoin proponents are not necessarily &quot;against regulation&quot;, but rather &quot;for a better alternative to regulation where there is one&quot;. Hence, it&#x27;s not inconsistent at all, let alone hypocritical, that they expect to make use of the advantages of regulation where it is needed - such as the MtGox bank, which is not bitcoin, and thus does not provide the technical protection promoted by bitcoin proponents, and has to rely on regulation instead.<p>By the way, are you possibly confusing regulatory protection from bank failure with some kind of protection against a failed investment? If at all, this is about recovering the balances people held with the MtGox bank, not about reimbursing them for money they lost because they invested in bitcoin - it&#x27;s just like when any other bank fails, really: If you buy IBM shares through your bank, you might expect that the financial industry as a whole would make sure that those shares really are there and you can transfer your shares to a different bank when your bank fails, even if those happen to be shares of a competing bank - but if IBM went bust, you obviously would not expect to be able to recover the money you paid for the shares from anyone, that&#x27;s your investment risk.<p>And no, just because you promote some way of doing something does not make it hypocritical when you don&#x27;t actually do it. Just look up the definition, it just isn&#x27;t. Hypocrisy is when you claim to be doing something which you actually are not. Plus, there isn&#x27;t even any inconsistency - when you bet on a technology that would make regulation unnecessary in the future, why should that mean that you should not make use of regulation where it actually is necessary?",1393636677

The importance of location in the southwest US for the fledgling alternative energy market seems completely irrelevant if one is striving to become the worldwide majority supplier of a multi-billion dollar market.

One of them is that there are cases before the Supreme Court, including one involving Hobby Lobby, regarding whether private businesses should be forced to pay for birth control (by means of tax penalties) over moral objections.

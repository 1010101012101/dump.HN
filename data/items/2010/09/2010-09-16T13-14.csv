Not in developer terms like ""tightly coupled"" but rather in terms managers will understand - the real cost per client. Prove that a cleaner architecture will lead to faster turnaround and therefore reduce the overheads - leading to more clients and/or higher profits.<p>2. Design a cleaner architecture. Look at current and possible requirements. Maybe not too much detail, but perhaps a basic database schema, class designs, etc (whatever is appropriate to your language/framework).<p>3. If you are using MS tools, read up on the lastest developments there - ASP.NET MVC for example - and show how using new tools would improve the design.<p>4. Perhaps get yourself involved more in the management side of things. Learn more about the business as a whole, why decisions are made. That will make you sound more informed on the technical side as well.<p>If all else fails, then look for another job by all means - but bear in mind that the situation you describe is all too common in non-technical lead companies.

Apple employees (and, most notably, Steve himself) are the real world users they test with. Every important or critical product only ever sees internal testing, but much more important is that the rationale behind Apple's design process is that of an actual designer thinking about solving problems from a user’s own perspective, whereas Google's ""design process"" is based entirely on trying to solve problems from an engineering perspective.* Often, they take it so far that they only solve engineers' problems, not even general users' problems.<p>* That's bad because the vast majority of people on this world are not dedicated engineers.",1284645507

IE9 is a sincere attempt at getting up to speed with HTML5 and CSS3, and whilst they aren’t yet including some of the things we may personally wish to see most (e.g. CSS Transitions), claiming they have yet to “change their ways” is nothing more than an unhelpful attempt at putting Microsoft in the “evil“ corner.<p>Microsoft themselves have long been trying to get people to upgrade from IE6 and Windows XP.

It will take a lot of time, and that time won't be very enjoyable.  You seem rather proud of having been an engineer longer than some commenters have been alive, but just about everybody who could say that about me is retired or dead by now and I actually have done production-level work in some of these areas so maybe you'll have to find a different excuse for dismissing my advice.<p>Although it's possible to determine that the large pile of bleeding-edge technology and almost-as-large pile of reinvented wheels that you've described is almost certainly the wrong solution, it's hard to tell what the right solution might be without any description of what you're trying to achieve.  At least part of it looks like an attempt to clone DynDNS, so perhaps one starting point would be to look at what they're doing and how it might be improved.  Using something like BigCouch that's already clustered seems like a good start, though I'd contend that something like Riak/Voldemort/Cassandra does that particular kind of clustering better.  Adding Redis to the mix seems to add very little, since it's inherently a SPOF and you don't mention anything that would use its unique capabilities.  Similarly, why not measure the effectiveness of the caching already inherent in your primary Couch/Riak/whatever store before you consider adding yet another caching layer?<p>My advice would be to use BigCouch/Riak or similar as your authoritative data store, and not add Redis or separate caching.  That leaves your node.js front ends as the only thing that could possibly benefit from your home-grown cluster management, and if they're written properly so that they're not coupled to one another (bad for availability anyway) then you won't need that either.  If you try that and still find that you need to build something else then fine, but I very seriously doubt that you would except as an artifact of implementing the simpler architecture poorly.",1284643423

Paragraph one points to a blog post <<a href=""http://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/2010/09/oracle_and_openjdk.html&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/2010/09/oracle_and_openjdk.ht...</a>; that describes that Oracle will continue with Java 'business as usual'. (aside: I think HN should link to that blog directly). Paragraph two gives a tiny bit more info. Paragraph three give some background info that most HN readers probably already know.<p>For me, the main open question is whether we should be happy or sad that Oracle promises to ""work with the OpenJDK code base and the OpenJDK community like Sun did""?",1284642225

Yes you should report your LLC income separately on a 1065 & allocate profit/loss if there are multiple owners. However, if there is only one owner, it is IMO an extra unneeded step.<p>For a small business with one owner, a Schedule C (or C-EZ) attached to the 1040 will suffice. No need to send a 1065 to the IRS and then submit a K1; it is just a small business in the eyes of the IRS.<p>Keep it simple by keeping track/records of your business income and expenses and report it on the Sched C which attaches to your 1040.<p>Note: I am currently taking a corporate tax course & studying for the CPA exam. I prepared taxes as a VITA volunteer last year.",1284642190

In short: Go compiles to native code (no VM), it has a totally different type system (no classes, not everything is an 'object' like in Java), it permits fine control over memory layout and allocation, it has powerful concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels), and more. Do yourself a favour and look beyond the syntax. It really is very different to Java (or Actionscript?! that's one of the more bizarre comparisons I've heard).",1284642078

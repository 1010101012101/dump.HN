Public loves heroes, and competition where thrown off with the possibly false explanation for their success (""we can't beat the great Steve"").<p>I've been wondering if the same thing is happening with Elon Musk today. He plays the loveable underdog hero part well for PR (whether it's true or not) and doesn't never mention his staff or anyone by name or what they have done.<p>(When your hero dies, it can be a problem.

It's because protecting the guilty's rights ensures the innocent's rights are protected too.<p>It's not a matter of protecting the rights of guilty people or not, but determining how much to protect them. Every procedural protection has a cost. If a procedural protection might be invoked by a person who has a 10% chance of being innocent, then maybe it's worth the cost. If it's more likely to be invoked by a person who has a 1% chance of being innocent, then maybe it's not.

If you charge someone for a pre-order of something that doesn't actually exist yet and has a risk of not existing at all then you can be in violation of Visa/MC TOS quite easily. Typically the way most pre-orders work is that there's a deposit and then the actual charge occurs within some window of time prior to the thing being shipped.<p>If you want to do crowd funding you can do that but you need to set up the expectations differently, to make sure that people know that they are <i>donating</i> to a project and <i>maybe</i> receiving a reward.

How would you go about it?<p>I was about to answer this and then realised how stupid it would be to give people ideas on how to kill vast numbers of people with off the shelf equipment. I will say that it doesn't seem like a hard problem to me, and I can see ways you could achieve rates in the hundreds of people a month.<p>> And how easy would it be for the security apparatus to catch you?<p>Pretty much impossible beforehand. Depending on what one did and where, it wouldn't necessarily be that hard. Some of the ideas I had seem long-term viable though - the sort of thing you could repeat with little chance of getting caught.<p>> Would you be able to, evading capture, perform another attack a week later? How long could you go on?<p>Some currently vulnerable infrastructure would probably harden over time but I've put like five seconds thought into this, I'm sure there are other things that one could do as well. And even if the number of deaths might not be huge - 20 people here, 20 people there, maybe a few hundred with a higher concentration target - the fact that you could strike many targets at once, and how difficult it would be to secure against you.... I think you could do very significant damage.<p>The fear you'd induce in people, every day knowing that, for instance, if their kids go to school, maybe they never come home again. Or if they go shopping, or.... It's a horrible thing to think about. If that sort of crap was going on, and the police weren't catching this guy, I'm not sure I could bring myself to send my daughter out in public even knowing that statistically the risk per person would still be very low.<p>I'm not sure that people could get used to the idea that every month a few hundred of them were going to die.

5605462,comment,5604914,5605251,1,0,waps,,,"Yeah but you've got to appreciate the irony in America. America has a very selective elite who have a very narrow definition of what that elite is (ivy-league, ""entrepreneurial"", rich, democrat, ...) and is regularly accused of having -very- little tolerance for anyone outside of their core group ... I wouldn't say that's true for the whole group, but there's a significant portion of them that certainly do this.<p>And this elite is blasting everyone else for not having an equal system. Seriously. Of course the French aristocrats did the same. I'm sure many elites, present and past, liked to claim their superior status was due to ""inherent"" but ill-defined characteristics : nobility, chivalry, scientific accomplishment (like the Roman elites did) ... are all words that come to mind. None of them held up their own ideals. The majority of French noblemen were cruel drunks. So were most Roman elites if Cicero's anything to go by. I'm not saying America's Ivy-league elite is a bunch of drunks, but they certainly don't satisfy their own rules : they are not social (in the political sense), they do not advance equality (quite the opposite), and most importantly : it is not the case that they're the self-selected best and brightest. Like all other elites, the reason they get in power is that they are in power and get pulled in by their buddies (which, granted, beats why French noblemen were elite : because great-great-great-great-great-granddad managed to get a command position in the king's army. The first generation of French noblemen were probably very capable people who genuinely meant well).<p>The only distinguishing characteristic that matters in members of America's elite is friendships and other associations with other members of the elite. As for ""best and brightest"", you could say that there's a (low) lower bar that they need to hit. That's it.",1366857839

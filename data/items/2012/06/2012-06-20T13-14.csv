To the chopping block!<p>Oh wait, no. There are lots of german speakers in the US, but when German companies do business here, they send people  who can speak English. Many (most?) US companies send employees to do business in other countries who speak the local language. It doesn't have to be even a fluent level of speech, but the gesture is well received on all ends. It is a general courtesy to at least attempt to have people who speak the language, as it signals other cultural awarenesses and sensitivities.",1340200746

You can create a display list or you can use vertex arrays. In fact the reason for including display lists in the first place was to make it so you didn't have to send one vertex at a time.<p>I don't agree with JWZ, regardless. OpenGL ES was a good simplification to the overall system. But he is right in that an optional compatibility layer that lives on top of OpenGL ES would have kept the original API valid for those who need it (and without slowing down the core of OpenGL ES).",1340200670

4136951,comment,4131442,4131442,7,0,ago,,,"I am a convicted malware coder (Agobot/Gaobot/Phatbot/etc...) and it all started because of a chat I had with a botmaster.<p>Back then I needed a key for Warcraft III, which just came out, so I tried some keygen I found on the net, without any antivirus. When the keygen did not work I knew something was wrong, so I checked for suspicious network traffic and saw some IRC connection, quickly found the process responsible for causing the traffic and fired up a disassembler. After UPX unpacking I had the assembler code to the program and was able to determine the IRC server, the bot password (they didn't use password hashes or hostmasks back then) and I got a command reference for the specific bot (SDBOT). I joined the channel disguised as one of the bots, logged in and sent the remove command. This kills the botnet. The bot herder was pissed, but I started talking to him and I got interested in malware to get CD keys, which I couldn't afford at the time.<p>I started modifying SDBOT for my usage, writing scanners and fixing bugs in the IRC connection code. After I while I felt limited by the codebase and started my own called Agobot. Agobot quickly grew into one of the most capable trojans at the time, with thousands of variants. I also quickly got a team of at peak ~15 people together who helped with testing and coding. Coding was mostly done by me and at most 3 other coders. We were having really cool stuff, like wormride which was a tool to make other malware/worms spread Agobot instead of itself. It also contained an exploit that I wrote for the LSASS hole that Sasser used only a few days after the advisory. My LSASS exploit did not crash the target, which let it spread a few days without being noticed. ISC noticed it after a while and raised the threat level to orange.<p>There was also a variant of the bot that used the waste network to communicate and the gnutella network to find themselves. It made the DHS shit their pants and release an advisory :)<p>First I hosted the bots on public IRC, but after being detected very quickly I got to talk with some IRC opers that offered me a private server to run the botnet in exchange for usage rights. These were powerful servers, holding around 50k bots at peak. Basically this all got busted by the FBI, which caused the Foonet/CIT shutdown.

The company running the datacenter detected the scan and decided to investigate the server (illegaly) and found all the stuff (I didn't even think about encrypting all that). I got 2 years probation for this as well as hacking Valve Software.<p>Hers some more info:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agobot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agobot</a><p><a href=""http://www.honeynet.org/node/55"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.honeynet.org/node/55</a><p><a href=""http://www.infectionvectors.com/vectors/kitchensink.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infectionvectors.com/vectors/kitchensink.htm</a><p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20070423182932/http://www.lurhq.com/phatbot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20070423182932/http://www.lurhq.c...</a>",1340200608

And then it's fragmented into the 7"" and 10"" form factors, with a glut of really low priced alternatives in the 7"" segment, which is also competing with the Kindle.<p>Apple has spaced out the form factors in a way that creates room for the iPad for people who stick with Apple products. For people who don't stick with Apple products, it's hit and miss - if you pick a large phone, and a small laptop, or a big laptop + a netbook, and possibly throwing a Kindle into the mix, and the additional benefit of a tablet diminishes greatly.",1340200473

Here's how it works:<p>Freelancing allows me the flexibility to dedicate pockets of time to side-projects that require a push. I simply don't book myself of 3-4 weeks if I know I need the time for a side project. This allows these side-projects to organically flourish rather than wither in the long term. If and when any of these projects become a source of income, I can easily turn my attention to it without having to change my lifestyle.<p>Regardless of their monetary success (some of my projects are not meant to be products at all), I've noticed that they act as magnets towards the kind of freelancing jobs I'd like to take. This creates a positive feedback loop, as the freelancing gigs often help me push forward at least one of the side projects (code wise or knowledge of the domain).<p>Overal, the trick is to keep your projects (paid or not) within your core curiosity-zone. If you're just starting out, the mission is to get closer to this zone with every new freelance gig. The end result is that enjoy both the side projets and my freelancing gigs. The line between them blurs more and more every-day.",1340199991

If it's a geeky crowd, you'll probably get at least 10% picking 42.""</i><p>This is so true that, for many years, magicians would use it as a ""mind reading"" parlor trick. The number 7 comes up with outsized frequency when people are asked to choose a number between 1 and 10 (the further out you expand the set, the lower the probability of their picking 7 -- but not by as much as you might expect). So much so, that you could fairly reliably ask someone to pick a number, guess that they'd picked 7, and be correct.<p>This is because most people don't actively think about the answer. They just select the number that comes most readily to mind. In Western culture, 7 is ingrained fairly heavily as a lucky/special number, and we encounter it with enough frequency that it'll be a likely choice for the brain's equivalent of the auto-fill feature.<p>You're much more likely to get a truly random sampling if your question requires thought or calculation, or if the bounds are unusual enough to warrant active thought. For instance, ""Pick a number between 2 and 99"" isn't drastically different from ""Pick a number between 1 and 100."" But it's different enough that it cues the brain to stop for a millisecond and actually think about the question. As a result, it's slightly more likely to generate a unique/uncommon number. (An even stranger set, such as ""Pick a number between 6 and 73,"" will force the person to think even longer).",1340199967

And those people are niche; if you can replace all of your computing with an iPad, then you may as well be using just a phone.<p>I was at a Parent Teacher Association meeting at an East London primary school last night. There were about 15 people there. 3 had iPads.<p>I was using mine to take minutes - really just adding notes to the agenda that was already in Word, via pages. Mainly just adding brief notes to discussion points, noting whether something had been carried. I used to use paper, but the iPad is more difficult to lose and I don;t have to re-type.<p>When the issue of the the next meeting came up, people used the iPad to look at the calendar - fine - that could have been done by phone. One member couldn't make it, but joined us via Skype on an iPad.<p>Meanwhile the Headmistress was keeping a check on the England Ukraine scores.<p>A question came up about the prices for a bit of equipment - a quick Google search found it in the meeting, rather than having to be discussed in the next meeting.<p>The thing about the iPad is that it isn't necessarily better than a laptop at anything, it's just incredibly convenient. It's the kind of thing you take along 'just in case'.<p>Oddly enough, just about the only thing I don;t use it for is consuming iTunes media. I rip videos for the kids to watch on holiday sometimes, but never use iTunes.",1340199211

Only that windows UI is in my opinion vastly superior just because it is consistent and well thought out compared to the rest.<p>Half of what you are saying is exactly what I said myself: Gnome and XFCE indeed follow almost the exact same desktop paradigm as Windows, so obviously they share many of the same problems. Most notably the problems of having a start menu to do things or a taskbar that quickly gets cluttered if you have many applications open at the same time. The other half of your statement doesn't make any sense to me. What exactly is more 'consistent' or 'well thought out' in Windows 9x/XP/2000, compared to Gnome 2.x/XFCE?<p>> Yes there is a reason. OS X might be more beginner-friendly but as soon as you actually start to use it you realize it isn't user-friendly. As on most/all simple systems (including OS X) doing stuff that wasn't intended is extremely cumbersome.<p>I guess one of us must live in some kind of bizarro world, because what you are saying is completely the opposite of my experience.<p>OS X = easy out of the box, consistent, great window management, powerful CLI for power users. Yes, it has 'hidden settings', but so does every other OS, and for almost all of them you have nice GUI tools to control them<p>Windows = cumbersome to use and many non-discoverable functions out of the box, inconsistent in almost everything, very basic window management (basically min/maximize/close plus a taskbar), a CLI that is almost an insult to the user. Yes it is also full of 'hidden settings' which are all stuffed in some kind of binary blob called the registry, indexed by cryptic keys.<p>Care to give some examples of things that are easy in Windows and hard in OS X? I'd love to hear them.<p>> Doing things on Windows is comparatively both easy and logical, which enables you to do what you want (and not what the designer thought you wanted) way faster than OS X allows you to.<p>You can't be serious about this, if you are, you have never used OS X (or any modern Linux desktop environment, for that matter). I've been using all 3 platforms extensively over the last decade, and Windows is decidedly the worst when it comes to doing things faster. OS X is hands-down the best in that respect. Just count the number of clicks or key presses required to do anything. In OS X most if not everything I regularly do takes at most one keypress and/or 3 clicks. In Windows I often have to click through 5 or 6 windows, dialogs, dropdowns, tabs and whatnot. Just launching applications in a 3-level deep start menu already takes 5 clicks.<p>You really come off as a lifetime Windows user who got so comfortable with the desktop environment that you simply don't notice how backwards and inconvenient it is.",1340199129

I occasionally deal with some of the guys writing (parts of) the GL specs.<p>This article is a load of bollocks. It actually isn't the first article I read that complains about the removal of immediate mode in GLES. This article, like the others I've read, leaves me with the impression that the author is rather clueless.<p>The article essentially complains that a feature from a 20 year old API should have been included in an API designed 10 years ago. The glBegin/glEnd API is a horrible mistake from the start and it should have never existed. It's a good thing it's removed from the GLES API. OpenGL 1.x and GLES 1.x are both deprecated, more than 10 years old and should not be used any more. In any case, he's complaining about mistakes(?) made more than 10 years ago.<p>One major flaw in jwz's reasoning is that something was removed. Immediate mode was indeed removed from the spec but an implementation of GLES w/ immediate mode never existed. It was dropped from the spec to avoid having the GLES implementers to waste time adding a legacy drawing API that is essentially useless and has awful performance.<p>GLES1 was a stripped down API for early mobile 3d applications that used rather primitive hardware or software.<p>There are lots of flaws in the GL(ES) API, but removal of immediate wasn't one of them. If anything, they should have fixed/broken the API more and intentionally destroy backward compatibility.<p>The the committees designing the API's are understaffed and have too much work on their hands. They're trying to make the interests of hardware manufacturers, content creators and OEM's match. Because of all these pressures, they're not really doing a great API but at least we have some kind of well-specified standard. Calling these people idiots doesn't help anyone.<p>With modern 3d API's, the vertex data is pushed into buffers in video memory. If you're writing 3d code in the 21st century, that's what you should do.<p>So a legacy feature that the author depended on was removed and rather than updating his code to run on modern software and hardware he re-implements it in software.

Here's the comment:<p>""The iPad is a tool and toy you might not need, but if used to the max it'll probably enhance your life in some noticable way.<p>Every single morning, while sipping coffee and waiting for my omelette to finish cooking, I catch up on the latest news through Reeder, the first RSS reader I've actually enjoyed using. I also check my mail to see if there's anything important I need to respond to right away.<p>When I'm finished eating and catching up to the latest news, I grab my iPad and go upstairs for my exercize. While doing strenght training I use my iPad to quickly make a note of how many reps and how much I lifted. After I'm done with my strength training, I take a run either outside or on my threadmill. If I take the run on the threadmill, I'll use the iPad for watching a video, maybe South Park or TED.<p>After I've showered, groomed, brushed my teeth and flossed, it's time to start working. When I work my iPad is always lying on the desk next to my laptop. I use it for:<p>* Displaying my ToDo-list (the Hit List)<p>* Displaying the email I'm working on.<p>* Displaying some relevant notes to the work I'm doing (Evernote).<p>* Displaying a PDF or website containing documentation to what I'm working on.<p>* As an extra screen (AirDisplay) for Photoshop tool pads and similar.<p>* VNC or SSH to another computer<p>* The occational check of HN, Twitter or Facebook.<p>* Calculator<p>* Calendar (Week Cal HD)<p>Yup, everything I've mentioned could be done on a normal laptop. However, it's incredibly useful to have an extra screen for displaying relevant information that'll never be obscured by application windows covering the information.<p>After I'm satisfied with my work for the day, I might hang out with my friends, perhaps take a picnic in the park. My iPad is always accessible in my manpurse. If a customer has an emergency problem, I can quickly and easily log into their server and fix the problem (Textastic/Prompt). If I get a brilliant idea, I'll note it down in Evernote and analyse it with the Business Model app. Maybe I want to think deeply about my business - I'll just open Dropbox and read through some business documents about future plans or surf on some of my competitor's sites through Mercury Browser.<p>When I'm back home I might do some more work or chill out with some games. Perhaps I'll open Rage HD and have one of the most immersive and physically exhausting gaming experiences possible through the Virtual Window control mode.<p>Right before I go to bed, I write in my diary (Day One) and finish my TODO-list for tomorrow.""",1340198345

Before you read further, let me underscore the obvious: Berkshire has a dog in this fight, and you should therefore assess the commentary that follows with special care. That warning made, however, let me explain why the rate differential causes problems for both large numbers of lower-income Americans and Clayton.<p>The residential mortgage market is shaped by government rules that are expressed by FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Their lending standards are all-powerful because the mortgages they insure can typically be securitized and turned into what, in effect, is an obligation of the U.S. government. Currently buyers of conventional site-built homes who qualify for these guarantees can obtain a 30-year loan at about 5 14%. In addition, these are mortgages that have recently been purchased in massive amounts by the Federal Reserve, an action that also helped to keep rates at bargain-basement levels.<p>In contrast, very few factory-built homes qualify for agency-insured mortgages. Therefore, a meritorious buyer of a factory-built home must pay about 9% on his loan. For the all-cash buyer, Claytons homes offer terrific value. If the buyer needs mortgage financing, however  and, of course, most buyers do  the difference in financing costs too often negates the attractive price of a factory-built home.<p>..<p>We have tried to qualify more of our customers loans for treatment similar to those available on the
site-built product. So far we have had only token success</i>",1340198064

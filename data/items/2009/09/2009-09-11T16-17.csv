This is on top of the problem that solids without an atomic lattice of some form tend to have trouble allowing any kind of electron movement at all, regardless of what chemicals you add to it (there are quite a few exceptions, like chlorophyll, but even those tend to be well-defined at the molecular level).<p>Also, as the author mentions, hair soaked in salt water becomes conductive, not semiconductive - current running through it is simply passed on by the salt water - but this conductivity has nothing to do with the hair and everything to do with the water.",1252688017
817666,comment,817099,817222,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I was having a little fun at others' expense. I never said it wasn't a hoax, but the science <i>is</i> there, but it isn't 'here' in the sense that it's usable today. I got upvoted talking about photosynthesis with no mention of photovoltaics in an article about a PV cell.<p>Chlorophyll is currently being developed as a low cost dye in solar cells (the dye is the photoelectric material sandwiched in the middle that produces the electricity). Melanin itself is currently of interest due to it enabling the standard dyes (silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, etc) to capture electrons they shouldn't be able to, it somehow takes low-energy light (even infra-red) and kicks it up a notch for the standard dye to capture.<p>Melanin in itself has a few amazing properties. It's apparently photoelectric right through from IR to Gamma rays, and also alpha, beta and neutrons produce the same effect in it. The IR and UV effects are the best features, making it an efficiency booster in existing solar panels by one means or another. The fact that it can potentially produce electricity through radiation has a whole other interesting factor to it, it creates the potential for a direct radiation->electricity just as solar cells have provided for solar energy (coal, oil and natural gas are just dead plants and animals that harvested solar energy a million years ago, wind is the thermal effect from solar, hydroelectric comes from rivers that came from rain that came from a heated ocean, etc). The two raw power sources we have are solar and nuclear (I suppose technically tidal and geothermal are raw sources too, but neither are developed enough), skipping the middle-men, so to speak, in the process is likely to be crucial in our future.<p>Melanin photovoltaic cells could enable the direct harvesting of radiation to produce electricity from many sources. Either stray radiation in a nuclear reactor (basically as radiation shielding that makes you money), or as an alternative to RTG's, but currently its greatest use in this field could be harvesting energy from nuclear waste, both the thermal products and the ionizing radiation. It's also of interest for space, as ionizing radiation there is immense, the sun emits vast amounts of x-rays constantly, we're just buried under our planets radiation shields.<p>The science <i>is</i> there for melanin as I said, but it'll likely take a lot of R&D before a melanin-based cell is on the store front, and it likely won't appear on its own to the general public as the uses of melanin-based cells are likely to be found where civilians are not (IE radioactive places or space).",1252687844

Since Palm controls both APIs and the player, it can ensure that every update of the APIs will not break user experience.<p>API changes have traditionally been managed through communication through developer documentation.  Palm saying ""trust us to communicate internally (between our WebOS team and our App teams) better than we communicate to our 3rd party developers"" tells you the following: (A) - Palm reserves the right to communicate less effectively to its 3rd party devs than to its internal app devs.  Also, Palm internal apps get the ability to test against new WebOS updates prior to general distribution, but 3rd party devs might not. (B) - Palm reserves the right to make certain APIs private which can possibly be used as a competitive advantage.<p>2) Palm rejected the app from the palm store. Not banned the app from being used on webOS. In other words if I want to I can still install it, just not via. the app store. This is a huge difference from ""apple app store or hack the firmware"".<p>I never said Palm was evil and their device was locked down.  Don't infer into my posts.

I picked up a Macbook for her and figured I'd be a good son and set it up for her. I go to do so and quickly realize, unlike my days in the windows world, there was little ""setting up"" to do. So I ran software update that way I could at least feel like I did something.<p>Then when showing my Mom how to use the Mac I realized… there wasn't much ""showing to do"". Once she was on the web browser it didn't matter what was ""around"" the browser… as long as the browser worked without flaw by all means my mom was already a master of the mac. So I twiddled my thumbs.<p>The Mac is like a blank sheet of paper and a pencil, ready for you to do with it whatever you choose… and for some that can be intimidating, paralyzingly so.<p>Windows is like a sheet of paper with a tic tac toe grid and one x already drawn, always ready to be played… this is comforting because even if you do not have a task to perform with the paper and pencil you can burn time by playing the game.<p>So if Mac is ""the absence"" and Windows is ""the game"" what is it that is absent from Mac, what is this game that is Windows?<p>The game could be called ""The defragging anti-viral registry cleaning pop-up blocking trojan horse riding Hero and his conquest of Windows"".<p>While many Windows users claim they are frustrated with the annoyances that plague the Windows world (like viruses and all to often system maintenance tasks) I'm not so sure this is true. In fact I'm beginning to realize that they love it!<p>I'm not saying this satirically or sarcastically, but literally.<p>Windows users never have to stare at a blank piece of paper. The Windows operating system, with it's myriad of ""upkeep"" tasks ensure one is never left to his/her own imagination but instead be enticed to play ""The Game"".<p>I'm guessing most Mac users have Google as their homepage and that's comfortable for them… it's sparse and ready to be commended to do whatever one so choose.<p>But most windows users probably have a portal as their homepage, like Yahoo or AOL. Portal sites do not require a catalytic action on the part of the user, the user instead is provoked to act in a predictable fashion: read this article, watch this video, read this email. Always a tic tac toe game with one ""x"" already marked… enticing you to strategically mark an ""o"".<p>In conclusion<p>There may always be a place for a personal computing design that implies a user act on it instead of just acting with it. Windows user today are going to begin to make a new statement with their choice to continue to use Windows (wether they like it or not). The statement?… ""I like the old days when a guy would take care of his computer, clean it of viruses, defragment it's hard drive… it just made you feel good when you knew your's would run better because you took better care of it"".<p>If you have things to do with your computer… get a Mac. If you have time to indulge yourself with games there will always be a cheap Windows machine waiting for you.<p>post script: technology inevitably dematerializes, loses it's weight and gravity… eventually it becomes ambient: everywhere and nowhere. Google Chrome OS is the eventuality of this movement… an operating system that is essentially a web browser running on lightweight silicon and nothing more. With less becoming less we return to nothing, and we return to a childlike state of curiosity of ""what could be"". Make no mistake I like seeing people switch to the Mac but my awareness campaign will be over before began as the new choice will be of ""which browser"" not ""which computer"".",1252687150

Since there's always a point that doesn't apply, expect people to zoom in on that part.<p>How about this: When you produce something without having negotiated a payment in advance, thus establishing its value to somebody, you have no right to complain when nobody finds enough value in the work to give you money. You are free to produce all the art, buggy whips, windows, or any other object you want, but you are not free to demand that people give you money afterward. You <i>are</i> free to try to convince them to do so (marketing), but insisting that people MUST appreciate your art with money is actually an infringement of other people's rights to have their own valuations of things, as you are imposing your valuations on them.<p>(That's a critical point there, BTW; ""right to have your own valuation"" may not be a right frequently talked about but it's really quite fundamental to many of the other much flashier and popular rights.)",1252686520

I need N number of developers, and N number of people to work on marketing and promotion. I also need N amount of dollars for hardware and office space in a downtown location.<p>If a person wanted to incorporate MyCompany, and then look for bank loans or funding, etc, what would be the best way to do it? I know that most businesses never actually get funding from investors, and a lot will just get a bank loan. If you were to go this route, what criteria are needed in order to get a loan for say, $300k? If the business ends up tanking, what happens to that debt? Who is responsible?<p>Now, say if you do manage to get funding, how does this usually happen with regards to exchange of capital? What happens if the company tanks, and the $300k in funding is lost?<p>I'm basically trying to conceptualize what sort of issues arise when raising money in both directions. Who is responsible? What do you need to do to secure capital? Who do you speak with? Etc.<p>Sorry if this is worded strangely, but I'm not sure how else to explain it. I would probably never even think about going a bank loan route if I was responsible for the money, but I hear that when you incorporate your company, you are no longer personally responsible for any losses.<p>Hopefully someone has some insight or resources on this topic, as it has always been in the back of my mind.<p>Thanks.",1252686432

In the How to Apply section for funding he explains a key thing he looks at is the founders, because initial ideas can and often do change. I think the optimum mix for a successful project is: competent key people, great idea, and market readiness. If all of these line up optimally I feel the venture will likely end up becoming a billion dollar company (youtube is an example). However, I think of all those the people component is most important, because smart competent people can make a success out of things lacking in other areas, but without competent people even great ideas will likely be bungled and flop (friendster and napster come to mind).",1252686080

Building an API isn't an easy thing to do and sometimes you want to go back and re-do parts of it which break applications.  The Pre is a really new device and it did take Apple a year to create an API for the iPhone.<p>Plus, Palm is allowing people to install it on their own (as the article notes).  By allowing it to live just not in the App Catalogue, it means that power users can install it and understand that it might break with an OS upgrade and they'll have to reinstall and when Palm finalizes the API, hopefully it will be in the app catalogue.<p>As long as a company allows me to install whatever I want, it doesn't matter so much whether I download it from their App Store or on my own.  Sure, the App Store has a lot of benefits, but it isn't the same as how Apple's been killing off stuff.  Sure, distribution won't be as good for the developer, but it's still alive.",1252686057

If I identify something that I'm passionate about, execute it well, and lady luck is on my side, I'll be in good shape.

6503958,comment,6501769,6501902,1,0,qznc,,,"> Rust has a great approach to safe regions. That&#x27;s a hard problem, and Rust has had to expend a considerable amount of firepower on it (four kinds of pointers etc).\nD does not offer safe regions; I believe the language design precludes that without at least an amount of discipline.\nSo Rust is better than D at safe regions. However, like in chess, good language design is to not sacrifice the whole for the beauty of the part. I think D is better than Rust at a lot of other things, because it has firepower it can afford to expend at problems that are also hard, and just as important.<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nl9at/i_am_a_member_of_facebooks_hhvm_team_a_c_and_d/ccjnjt0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nl9at/i_am_a_member_o...</a>",1381064295

The knowledge graph and its ability to remember and take advantage of context from previous searches are examples of this.<p>On the Watson side, a huge amount of what it was doing involved identifying keywords and finding relevant information from the clue words.   It did not really reason about questions or have a deep understanding of the semantic content of the query.   It was hand optimized for the sort of questions that tend to be asked on Jeopardy, which was an impressive feat, but in terms of being able to create new knowledge, as the author suggests?

Some library / scientific information retrieval systems tried to go in that direction, which resulted in retrieval systems that were just cumbersome to use.<p>Google nailed the search engine user interface quite some time ago and Peter Norvig is absolutely right when he says that users simply don&#x27;t want to ask questions when searching. They&#x27;re much faster at entering keywords relevant to their search intent because they&#x27;ve learned how to efficiently converse with search engines in their &#x27;native&#x27; keyword language.<p>Hence, passing the Turing test is completely irrelevant for search and information retrieval in general. Even in mobile environments where due to the device&#x27;s constraints a natural language user interface makes a lot more sense than on the desktop, software like Siri more or less is just some gimmick that in most cases is easily outperformed by more traditional input methods. Sure, asking Siri to &#x27;Show me the way to the next whisky bar&#x27; might be fun at first but simply entering &#x27;pub&#x27; and\nthe name of the town you&#x27;re in right now is still a lot more efficient. Again, I think Google nailed the user interface part with Google Now for mobile information retrieval as well. I don&#x27;t want intelligent machines to pretend they&#x27;re human. I want them to take a back seat and present me with the right information once it becomes relevant.",1381062867

It seems to achieve what I&#x27;d hoped Scala would but ended up failing miserably.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of merit to the &quot;Java philosophy&quot;: a gradual progression of what most programmers expect in a language. Google, for one, seems to have adopted the Java philosophy wholeheartedly in its new languages Go and Dart.<p>Kotlin is certainly in that camp: a gradual progression that will make programmers happier yet won&#x27;t turn their world upside down. It&#x27;s simply a better Java. So while Scala unfortunately evolved from being a better Java into the mother of all kitchen sink languages (assuming, of course, that your kitchen feeds a whole military base and has sinks the size of hot tubs), trying to cram Java, Haskell, Lisp and Javascript into a single compiler (I find it hard calling Scala &quot;a language&quot;; it&#x27;s more like a compiler that compiles code written in any of several languages), Kotlin takes a few steps back and comes up with a coherent philosophy.<p>I think 99% of Scala users will find Kotlin to provide 100% of their requirements, and at a much reduced complexity and mental load. So Kotlin, I think, is not only a better Java, but a better Scala.<p>Yet, I think Java 8 will be the game to beat, for Kotlin as well as Scala. Java is hugely popular, and those that haven&#x27;t migrated to other JVM languages so far, might be less likely to do so when Java 8 comes out. With lambda expressions and traits – the two killer features that attract many to Scala when it first came out – it gives Java a nice boost. Sure, Kotlin feels more like a fresh start, and has some other necessary features (properties), but will those be enough to switch people away from Java?<p>I think that one of the great achievements of Kotlin&#x27;s design, though, is that the transition could be very gradual. Kotlin places a very strong emphasis on Java interoperability (leaps and bounds better than Scala&#x27;s) and unlike Scala, Kotlin code is easily read by Java programmers. So teams would be able to easily replace individual Java classes with Kotlin code.",1381062863

6503856,comment,6503386,6503386,59,0,Lazare,,,"The reporting is frankly terrible.<p>Let me put it in simple terms.  An idea has been floating around for a while now that, in theory, you could use eminent domain to seize not just the houses, but the mortgages <i>on</i> the houses.  Let&#x27;s say that someone had borrowed $200k, but the house was now worth $100k.  If you were a local government, you could seize the mortgage from the mortgage holder paying them compensation of, oh, $80k, tear it up, then the home owner gets a new mortgage for $90k, and gives you the proceeds, which would pay you back for the compensation you had to give the mortgage holder, <i>and</i> leave you with $10k to cover your overheads, fees, court costs, and maybe even leave something over for the group of highly altruistic bankers pushing this scheme.<p>This is normally where I would say &quot;but there&#x27;s just one problem&quot;, but that would be a lie, because there&#x27;s at least three.<p>1) The constitution, post <i>Kelo</i>, is pretty lax about needing a good reason to deploy eminent domain, but it&#x27;s still quite strict about the compensation needing to be fair (ie, the market value).  The market value of a $200k mortgage for a $100k house is <i></i>NOT<i></i> $80k, or even $100k.  Even if the mortgage is currently in default, it still represents ownership of a house worth $100k; by definition that makes it worth $100k, no $80k...and many mortgages won&#x27;t default at all; even the ones who will eventually will be making payments in the meantime.  So right off the bat, legal analysts are confident it&#x27;s unconstitutional.  (But the city can&#x27;t offer the actual market value of the loan; they&#x27;re broke.)<p>2) Banks are going to be very displeased.  Except that&#x27;s a lie; in the US banks don&#x27;t actually make mortgages.  The Federal government does (more than 90%, in point of fact), through the FHA.  And they have already stated that they think this is the worst idea since forever, and they will take whatever steps necessary to shut it down, including just not making any more loans for houses in the region.  Which in context is basically the nuclear option; the value of a house which can&#x27;t get a mortgage is pretty much $0.  The scheme absolutely relies on being able to get a new mortgage on the houses.<p>3) Just as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the IRS has a lot of very strict rules involving gifts.  And buying someone&#x27;s loan and tearing it up counts as a gift, and you have to pay tax on it.  Quite a <i>lot</i> of tax, as it happens.  And the homeowners in question don&#x27;t have the cash, nor would they be thrilled at their massive tax bills even if they did.  Which, again, kills the scheme.<p>4) It&#x27;s also not entirely clear that this would be good policy even if it worked.  This isn&#x27;t the first attempt at trying to &quot;fix&quot; the problem of underwater mortgages, but results so far have been mixed at best.  Then there&#x27;s the broader policy implications of a bailout.  Once you crunch through the likely results of the program, it&#x27;s not exactly &quot;take from the banks and give to the poor&quot;.  The banks don&#x27;t actually <i>own</i> mortgages, and the poor don&#x27;t actually own houses.  It actually ends up being &quot;take from the pension funds and split the results between the middle class and some bankers&quot;.  Makes for great soundbites, but it&#x27;s not exactly Robin Hood and Sherwood Forest here.  More like the Sheriff of Nottingham.<p>TL;DR:  The plan is illegal, the federal government has already announced that they&#x27;re putting a stop to it (and they hold <i>all</i> the cards in the mortgage market), it wouldn&#x27;t work anyhow, and it&#x27;s probably bad policy even if it did.  It&#x27;s been called a &quot;scam&quot;, and frankly, that&#x27;s pretty accurate.<p>Edit:  From the article:  &quot;He&#x27;s actually the guy responsible for it all: Steven Gluckstern, a former insurance executive who had teamed up with Vlahoplus to co-found Mortgage Resolution Partners, the firm that&#x27;s lining up the capital -- from hedge funds, for instance -- to buy any mortgages that Richmond might seize. After that happens, Mortgage Resolution Partners would help the homeowner refinance through a Federal Housing Administration loan, and earns a $4,500 fee per successful transaction.&quot;  Keep in mind that the FHA has said they won&#x27;t make the loans.  The scheme, at its core, is for some bankers to use hedge fund money to grab assets from pension funds, then refinance it using super-cheap loans from the FHA to turn a quick buck.  But the FHA has stated it won&#x27;t make the loans, so the scheme is D-E-A-D dead.",1381062138

Well, Bob Bobson does not like to be known as a team player. Would Bob Bobson like to dispel that conclusion based on publically available data in our proprietary algorithms? Well, as it happens we also sell a &quot;TeamWork Evaluation Survey&quot;, where if you think your team work skills have improved you under go a comprehensive psychometric test (signed off on by our team of psychometric specialists) that verifies your team work skills. Of course, such a test is expensive, but isn&#x27;t the $199 worth it to be given a prominent &quot;Team Work: Gold Badge&quot; score? All that other stuff we said about you being a bad team player will go away.",1381061663

6503831,comment,6502825,6502825,3,0,csandreasen,,,"I didn&#x27;t see mention anywhere in the article regarding why the police releases the mugshots - I&#x27;m told by people working in legal professions that it&#x27;s actually a means of ensuring that the police aren&#x27;t overstepping their bounds and that people aren&#x27;t disappearing into jail without a valid conviction in court.  By making all of the information public regarding who they arrested the police can&#x27;t deny arresting them later on; by releasing the information about why he or she was arrested, the public can verify that the police are arresting people for legitimate reasons.  This is useful to the public, but I think it&#x27;s implemented in too naive a fashion.  It takes sensitive data about me and broadcasts it out everyone, any one of which could store it indefinitely and rebroadcast it indefinitely.<p>You can&#x27;t just not release the information for the aforementioned reasons.  You can disallow rebroadcasting the information - if I can&#x27;t release it to others, then the police could potentially take the information down after a few days, make you disappear, and then we&#x27;re back at square one.<p>I think in this case the danger of misuse by third parties outweighs the danger of police abuse.

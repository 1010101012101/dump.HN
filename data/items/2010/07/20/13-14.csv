I understand Mr. Graber's motivation. I also agree wholeheartedly that the ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" rule has to be applied consistently, i.e. if a police officer can videotape me over the course of his or her work, then I should be allowed to videotape that officer.<p>That said, what gives me the shivers is that our expectations of privacy, in general, seem to be sliding down a slippery slope of justified surveillance. The first time I read ""1984"", I was still in school (not even university yet) and it etched itself onto my mind precisely because it's so damn plausible. Everyone would love to think it's impossible because ""we would never stand for it"", but things keep changing slowly.<p>A commonplace example is your workplace, where your employer can monitor all your activities on their computers (and I mean <i>all</i>, not just network communication), record your business phone calls or videotape you. Also, it has become commonplace to have to do a drug test when applying for a job.<p>Another example is the highway toll system here in Santiago, Chile. Certain highways require you to have a device installed in your car to transit them. Instead of waiting in line at a toll booth, your device communicates with a gate under which your car passes and your billed monthly. Every gate also has cameras to record cases of infractions, when a car without the device passes under the gate.<p>Sure, there are laws and rules that control how all this information can be used. Yet it keeps creeping me out to think that this information is available to multitude of people. Now that information of all sorts can be shared easily and readily on a global scale, it seems even scarier. Now you can be embarrassed, humiliated, falsely accused or harassed literally in front of the whole world.<p>What creeps me out even more is that our expectations of privacy seem to be eroding slowly. If we're so indifferent to being under surveillance in public or at work because it makes it easier to prove who's right and who's wrong, why does it seem so implausible that in some future we would accept the same things in our homes? After all, wouldn't it help cut down on domestic violence and child abuse?<p>I hope I'm not coming across as a borderline paranoid nutjob, but I just felt the need to address the issue.",1279633796

They're proposing a wild jump into the dark and expecting you to shoulder <i>all</i> the costs, opportunity and out of pocket (not even a <i>discount</i>???).  The idea that you'll be ""their goto-guy"" looks unlikely; perhaps check out the developer agreement to see if you can even talk about what you learn to others, if you're the sort of person who can turn that into an advantage (assuming the platform takes off in this way).<p>So I'd say it comes down to how much of a gambler you are (compare Digital Research and Microsoft when IBM came calling for an x86 OS, although note that Bill Gates was <i>very</i> well connected through his parents) and what your current non-Kindle prospects are.  Can you turn your current iOS position into something greater?  Does an Android or whatever port have a serious chance at getting traction?  Right now you have <i>no</i> idea whatsoever if a Kindle app will or even can gain traction; Amazon's success at selling books is as you note elsewhere no indication of their likely success with apps.<p>Another way of looking at this is that few are likely to buy a monochrome Kindle to run apps on.  Many customers have a Kindle for it's fantastic convenience (the ability to read any of a large selection of books while running the kids around town, on a vacation, etc.) and a Kindle app market is a de novo marketing and sales proposition, although Amazon at least has a rather captive audience for the marketing (I'd pay real money to Amazon to have a switch for their site so that I'd <i>never ever</i> see anything about the Kindle outside of reviews).

Stopping real child abuse is important, but the system is so lopsided that merely being accused makes you the criminal. People spread the rumor of you being investigated by DFS, they don't spread the rumor of you being cleared.<p>My run-in was no where near as large of scale, but aggrivating, humiliating, time wasting, and ridiculous. I'm no hippy journalist letting my kids run free, basically just your run of the mill suburbanite developer 8-to-5 schmoe and my wife is a Special Ed teacher . One day, we come home from work to find that DFS had tried to visit and that we must call back with a time we can be interviewed. At the time, we had a six year old and a less than 1 year old. Someone had reported us for child abuse. It was like a record scratch. What? I don't hit my kids. My oldest went to a private school. I spent plenty of time with them. Our #1 fear is leaving them somewhere so my wife watches them like a hawk. It made no sense.<p>We called back and an agent came by the next day. We tried to leave our oldest at school because at that age, he would babble about what was happening and other parents would find out and the stigma would be set. But she demanded to see him, so my wife went and got him while I got the 5th degree. We were accused of some stuff that seemed hilariously lame.<p>* We made our son pee in a dollhouse toilet and just left it there full. --- Uh, yeah, one day we found it in the back of his room behind the shelf. We think he did it and hid it. Kids do weird things.\n* We let our oldest run around screaming and being reckless and has untreated ADHD. -- Yeah, he has ADHD, he's took Ritalin since he was 5 and is now on Adderall.\n* Our home is unsafe with rotten food all over. -- Yes, my wife is messy, but not to the level of fire hazard or health violation. Rotten food? You mean like having cans from last night's dinner still next to the stove?\n* And numerous other things like this...<p>After being checked out, she said that it was most likely a false report and that it would most likely be dropped, but the file stays around permanently and that we can't find out who made the report.<p>Of course, our son blabbed about the experience, and now even 5 years later, none of his school friend's parents let their kids come over to our house because the original rumor. No one makes false claims, right?<p>I figured out who made the report through the neighborhood network. Some old guy across the street who was mad that I left the trashcans out on the front of my home instead of the side and one time when I had let our grass grow too long because every night that I got home from work and all weekend for 3 weeks it had rained a crap-ton. I still catch him taking pictures of our house to call the Neighborhood Preservation office with when I let the slightest thing go wrong.

She continues on and at this point I am screaming at her and I slam the door and have an ice pick in my hand, keep in mind I resemble a younger Jack Nicholson (a lot). So here she is presented with a screaming man with an ice pick in his hand that looks as crazy as Jack in the Shining. She quickly left the house and returned with a police escort and always had an escort from the point forward. My wife said it was the most frightening things she had ever seen.

With the costs of flash and cameras becoming so inexpensive and the amount of wireless access around (GSM or Wifi) I was thinking you Tivo style record like 2 to 8 hours of video just with a circular buffer then if a triggering event happens (hazard button pressed, the record button pressed, a crash is detected, air bags deploy, the alarm triggers.. there are others)  you store the video from the circular buffer and store live recorded until told not to.  Then when you can contact the internet via wifi or possibly gsm,  start off loading the video to some server.   It seems like onstar already has most of the hard stuff done,   they just need some dvr type stuff.  2 cameras in a dome light like area could pretty much cover 270 to maybe a full 360 degree view of the car.  I'd guess it's like $1000, just from some past experiences, which isn't terribly unreasonable.<p>On the server there are 2 ways to access the video, the owner's password or a law enforcement key that could be accessed with proper court documents.<p>The other thing I was thinking, it's clearly an owner protection device but if you had some sort of encoded radio signal like they use to change the traffic signal lights.   All of the cars in an area could be used to help when there is an Amber alert or some major crime was happening.<p>For a moving violation like that,  why does a gun need to be drawn?

Assuming you are working part time, two to four weeks is not even remotely enough time to build even the simplest of businesses. Note I'm not talking about building an application, which you could complete in 3-4 weeks, I'm talking about building a business.<p>I would guess a more reasonable timeline for starting something in your spare time would be about 6 months until you get your first revenue, (or more likely your first 'pivot' because you finally have enough data to realize your idea sucks). I wouldn't be surprised if it took longer. So, whatever you choose to do, try to ask yourself if you are willing to spend most of your spare time for the next year working on it before you even see any money. As soon as you start passing ideas through this filter, I think you'll find more success.<p>Any more optimistic timeline is a time fantasy.<p>Side note: this is in my opinion the problem with starting something on the side. It's far too slow. Sometimes it looks like I'm going to be 30 before I make a dime! I think I could cut down this cycle to 2-3 months to my first 'pivot' if I was full time. In other words I think working full time would move things along 4X as fast. Add a competent cofounder and you could probably almost double that.",1279631472

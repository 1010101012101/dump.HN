Much like the Android issue, you cannot use the latest and greatest features because a large portion of your users are still on old platforms.<p>There is really three options available to web developers:
1) Do nothing
2) Employ some new features and allow for graceful degradation
3) Use the latest features and/or force users to upgrade their browsers<p>Most developers go for option #2. Browser vendors who employ a faster release cycle help reduce the time-to-market for new features to go mainstream.<p>I will make it simple:

Two years later, I won it again on my own.<p>The wins have had two effects on how I evaluate odds: first, so-called 'remote' probabilities I once found reassuring  <i>the odds of being hit by lightning in your lifetime is 1 in 10,000</i> or <i>the chances of being killed in a train crash are 1 in 500,000</i>  no longer have a calming effect. This can make me both nervous and acutely risk-aware. Some people call this introverted.<p>Second, the converse has also become true: so-called 'impossible' odds  the chance of winning the National Lottery jackpot three times, for example  no longer deter me from participating. This can make me both irrational and actively risk-seeking. Some people call this extroverted.<p>Regardless of this dichotomy, the OP's point of view rings true for me: the decision to play the lottery lies in entertainment value alone. It is unlikely that I will win again. But it is hard to resist the questions hammered out in lottery marketing campaigns. The ones designed to undermine rational resistance to extraordinary odds: ""What would you do if you <i>did</i> win?"" or, more bluntly, ""How would you spend it?""<p>It is harder still to resist simple cost-benefit analysis, which leaves the same question I've had since the beginning: <i>is dreaming worth the cost of entry?</i> My answer is always the same:<p>You bet it is.",1350730096

These days I see it more as a transitional tool rather than a long term solution.<p>The problems that I've seen with separate UX stories are:<p>* They can become something that gets dropped when pressure situations occur (it's 'only' a design story...)<p>* They get away from, on agile teams, the idea that <i>all</i> stories deliver direct business value (or Running Tested Features or whatever). I don't like design stories that fail to do this, in the same way I don't like development 'stories' like 'build database layer'.<p>* They tend to stay the sole job of the UX person and seem to act as a bit of a barrier to getting the whole team to help swarm on stories. They highlight the work - which is great - but they label it 'ux' so it becomes a subset of the teams responsibility rather than the whole team's responsibility.<p>I'd be interested to see how Lane feels about them in a years time - or as the team grows.

4676739,comment,4675741,4676020,2,0,saraid216,,,"> But I don't think any of the so-called Constitutional guarantees are absolute.<p>What does ""absolute"" mean?<p>The Constitutional guarantees are probably absolute, depending on what your idea of it is. What they aren't is comprehensively understood. You don't really seem to understand how the government works. This is what happens.<p>A law is written. This is the first gate; someone has to actually care enough to put it down on paper. This law can have arbitrary text and mandate arbitrary terms. It needs to be agreed upon by a good 500 people who are at least nominally looking out for the best interests of the full 310-million-person population. In the specific case of the OP, the Minnesota Legislature is about 200 persons representing 5 million. That's the second gate; a court of mild scrutiny. Then it has to be plausible enough for the elected president or governor to agree to enact it <i>and</i> actually do it. That's the third gate. At this point, and only at this point, does something like this have the opportunity to happen. This is the point at which something like owning a machine gun becomes illegal, and the police are allowed to arrest people who do.<p>There are a couple routes into the next stage, but this is the easiest to understand. The state decides to press charges against the offender under the aforementioned law. The lawyers involved may wish to ask the judge about the constitutionality of the law. Groups like the EFF and the ACLU watch for opportunities like this to step in on behalf of the defendant or plaintiff precisely in order to point out the unconstitutionality of certain laws and bring to bear the not-inconsiderable weight of their legal experience to prove it to the judge, who must make the final call. And, in case the judge makes a poor judgement (corruption, ineptness, etc.), there is a hierarchy of appeals that ends at the SCOTUS. It is usually through this mechanism that something like yelling ""fire"" is made illegal: Justice Holmes used it as a metaphor to establish a precedent, a test by which future judges could determine whether or not this was a reasonable exception to the broad stroke of the First Amendment.<p>Democracy is a lot more than a list of ten short paragraphs. Each of those rights have to be justified and defended and their nuance spelled out clearly based on actual events that occur in reality. What does free speech mean if, let's pretend, we had people who could reliably and provably enact mind control through speech? Is executing a heinous criminal without last rites a cruel and unusual punishment if we were certain there existed a Hell to which they'd be tortured for eternity? If everyone could be reasonably expected to own and effectively use a sniper rifle, is it self-defense to murder someone who threatens to shoot you? Upholding one's rights isn't easy, and it's made especially uneasy by the minor detail that we occasionally have no idea what they actually are in some specific case.",1350727333

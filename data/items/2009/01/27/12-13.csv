I'd love it if you could send me an email (peldi@balsamiq.com) with more details about the sluggishness you have found with Mockups.

452021,comment,451924,452014,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Metabolically humans alternate between anabolic and catabolic modes: sleep and eat more, then work more with less sleep and food.  Human metabolism is a sophisticated system for smoothing out highly variable energy intake.  Always eating the same three squares a day isn't synergistic.  I have found skipping meals when busy to be a very good idea.  There's a reason all cultures have traditional fast and feast cycles.<p>The idea of sustained caloric restriction, however, is probably stupid.  You just want variable intake, not low intake.  First of all, the studies are only of rats and worms.  Secondly, the studies fail to control for the fact that the starved animals get more exercise whereas the well fed animals languidly sit around.",1233060362

What most techies think usable might not be that much usable by non-techie user. As far as wiki is concerned, I find it challenging to use a wiki even being a techie. The obnoxious syntax of wiki is sufficient to scare away several users. \n As you mentioned, people like to send email, I would suggest creating a separate mailbox for leave applications and then writing bunch of scripts to parse the email and put the email in wiki, db or whatever you want to. Second option is to use a CMS and create web form, as most CMS have support for forms and reporting built in. I have done this with drupal couple of times and the solution has been received well by non-techies.\n In the end, what ever comments you receive on this thread will turn out to be useless if you are not willing to understand the reason why non-techies are not using the wiki ? Few minutes spent with the end user will save you several hours of developing and deploying a solution that will not be used by non-technies...",1233060252

The move unearthed photos that hadn't been seen in decades and prompted hours of fun memories and discussions about good times past.<p>Those discussions happened because the pictures were there in huge boxes and in our faces as we sorted through their stuff.  It's hard to imagine that same thing happening if the pictures had been locked away on a DVD or hard drive somewhere.<p>I know archive.org is doing a good job of cataloging the history of web sites, but what about all the un-archived pictures that people take and leave on their hard drives until they crash?

451996,comment,451432,451432,0,0,kailashbadu,,,"Ruby on Rails is not a CMS. It’s a framework. While it’s true that the line of demarcation between a framework and a CMS continues to blur, it’s still important to be able to tell one from the other. Conceptually, the two are discrete entities.<p>A framework is unified set of tools that make it easier to implement repetitive tasks. It’s not intended to be an end-product. Instead, it’s meant to be a foundation upon which you build your application. A framework, by definition, is a generic system. CMS, on the other hand is, an application that is supposed to solve a specific problem: managing the content. The problem with Drupal is that it tries to be the both a framework and a CMS and introduces a maze of abstractions.<p>The content itself as well as the kind of content management practiced tend to vary from one organization to the other. The whole concept of an ‘definitive CMS’, therefore, is ridiculously delusory.<p>A CMS, in my opinion, can approach this problem in either of two ways. Since a core set of common features could still be identified in each kind of CMS, a CMS can be generic system which different category of users can build upon to meet their respective requirements. Secondly, a CMS can zero in on a particular niche and provide all content management features applicable to that segment. This, of course, would render it, and rightfully so, unusable for other niches.",1233057838

451993,comment,451866,451882,0,0,chandler,,,"Where I work, I've noticed several trends:<p>- Duplicate work; as long as the wiki doesn't replace existing processes, placing things there is simply additional work.  Moreover, because it's additional, there's no guarantee that any desired piece of information will exist in the wiki.<p>- People don't like not having an ""owner"" to a document, especially regarding private edits and such.<p>- Wiki's make <i>you</i> search for a topic (i.e. they require work), whereas email threads are pushed to you by others motivated enough to CC.  Unfortunately, my motivation in tracking an issue will never be the same as the person directly affected by the issue.<p>- Mostly, however, wiki's don't provide a substantial functionality improvement to what I'm now going to dub the ""enterprise wiki"": i.e., Word documents on a shared drive.  Here, Windows provides structure (well, technically Solaris does, but it's accessed by the user via Windows Explorer), while Word provides the standard document editing interface (although we do work with many document types).<p>The main drawbacks are terrible search, manual (and content limited) revision control, and an inability to track updates.<p>The main upsides are a rich editing environment for documents (compare Word to a textarea), support for any document format (don't like doc files?  Use something else), and the opportunity for private collaboration & edits <i>without</i> implementing temporary ACLs (i.e., copy a file to the local drive, and email back and forth until publishable).<p>Personally, I think wiki's are great for collaboration between a heterogeneous, dispersed population.  However, at the large corporation where I work, Word + Explorer is a ironic example of the worse-is-better Unix approach (many tools, barely working together) clearly beating the wiki/web-based Monolithic design.",1233057714

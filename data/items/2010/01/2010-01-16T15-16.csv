I was very interested in chemistry from 7th grade and up, and did a lot of home experiments including some more or less flammable stuff.

At work we use Prototype and Scriptaculous to achieve the richer interfaces our customers are beginning to demand, so that means you also have to understand the DOM model.  This view layer of the site is actually in JSP, since we're a Java shop, running in a Tomcat servlet container on the J2EE stack: Struts, Spring, etc etc.  The web services are REST (via RestEasy / the Apache HTTPClient -- you'd better be expert at the HTTP protocol, by the way, or you're not getting very far here) and our older ones involve XML-RPC / SOAP.  Oh yeah, XML, that's handy to know, along with YAML and JSON.  Anyhow, the data which is actually being served up is stored in the database and accessed via SQL.  There are a few hundred kb of stored procedures running around -- you'll want to be able to write them in Oracle and Postgres, since customers use both.  Authentication is usually via LDAP except when it is via OpenID except when it is via OpenID backed by LDAP.<p>The system is built with Ant, Groovy, and Ruby, and deployed on RedHat Linux.  You'll be expected to know SH and BASH shell scripts and perform various sysadmin tasks as required, for example, configuring firewalls, Apache, and nightly batches via cron'ed up shell scripts.<p>In addition to doing Java, we also do migrations from Perl systems and much of our internal utilities are written in either PHP (yay, outsourcing) or Ruby.<p>One of the core tasks of our customers is creating ""reports"".  We have a software package (which you haven't heard about) which does this for us.  You need it to know it backwards and forwards.  Also, if it ever fails, knowing how to debug PDFs would be a real help.<p>I haven't gotten past ""generic web developer"" into the world of fun that is ""IT needs specific to Japanese universities"", such as dealing with the common Japanese bank interchange format to process tuition payments.

First, for a long time, the actual number of females in the world doesn't match the 105/6 to 100 number above. This has been described by Amartya Sen as the ""missing women"" problem.

1057014,comment,1056174,1056536,0,0,gvb,,,"In my experience (24 years in a large company doing a lot of large projects), the coupling of different pieces of the program is <i>severely</i> underestimated.  The result is that The Plan lays out the schedule with Alice and Bob working in parallel, but in reality they end up requiring a lot of interaction before the project is done.<p>Typically in a large project, Alice and Bob work independently but make different assumptions and have to rework a significant amount of their code when they finally get together to integrate their two parts.<p>In my experience, large teams can shrink calendar schedule time by brute forcing the dependency failures.  The trade-off to achieve schedule compression is substantial inefficiencies and often a loss of quality and maintainability.  I am convinced that a lot of schedule slippage in large projects is due to incorrect assumptions with respect to the independence of the pieces.  While it is possible to compress the schedule this way, all schedule compression that exceeds the true parallelism in the project requires exponentially increasing effort to overcome the inefficiencies due to the coupling.<p>This is behind Brook's Law <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookss_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookss_law</a> ""2. Communication overheads increase as the number of people increases.""  Communication overhead is the indication of coupling of the pieces.  If Alice and Bob's pieces were truly independent, they would not need to communicate and Brook's Law would not apply.<p>The physical analogy to the effort required to shrink calendar time is the ""hull speed"" of boats.

I see a lot of relatively minor risk-taking behavior.<p>Saying 'my drafting is fine' when it really isnt, is a risk, because you could fail the class. Putting yourself out there and saying 'Come look at my work, its awesome', is a risk, because it could get flung back in your face as not awesome. Giving yourself the positive assessment that you would hope for is a risk, again because it could be rejected.<p>But none of these things strike me as examples of being a jerk. They are examples of taking little risks that help to optimize the chances of a positive outcome. Sometimes these risks have no little-to-no-downside.",1263654410

(Cockiness works, but not overt boasts).<p>Men do need to be more aggrandizing in professional life.  Men do not carry a baby to term and nurse it for years.  All they bring to the mating game is wealth, status, and genes.  Thus, professional success is much more important in order for a man to attract a mate.  Thus men are much more aggressive and do whatever it takes to rise the ladder.<p>On the flip side, when a women is self-aggrandizing it is quite a turnoff to a man.  It much more actively harms her reproductive success.  So women learn not to do it, and that rubs off in professional life.",1263654138

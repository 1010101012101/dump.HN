Yes, you won&#x27;t end up on the street because you can&#x27;t pay your rent, but it does create a ton of new problems that can lead to isolation.<p>A few that come to mind, that I&#x27;ve noticed with wealthy friends:<p>1. Time. You&#x27;ll probably have plenty. You&#x27;re free. What do you do all day when your old friends are working? That probably means making new friends. But it can also lead to disconnects with old friends. Most people don&#x27;t understand.<p>2. Ulterior motives of people. Imagine you meet a person - any person. Most relatively wealthy people will assume this person wants something from them. Guess what, people DO usually want something from them. This can lead to problems bonding and/or having relationships.<p>3. Investing and taxes: what if I invest badly and lose all my capital? Ok, so you invest in a property in Spain and a few years later sell it. You pay $x tax. For some silly reason the authorities don&#x27;t agree, and want to levy additional tax x2. On top of that, your tax lawyer isn&#x27;t great, and you need to go find a new one. It&#x27;ll drag on for years, going through the courts.<p>etc etc<p>Many people would say, cry me a river.

You might want to sleep in a tent and wake up with the sound of roosters and moaning cows, while paying virtually nothing. Or you can pick a campsite, where you can use a fridge, showers and a pool. Maybe there is even an attractive hostess, who wants to play drinking games. If you are prepared to pay more, you can stay in a tent and live as a king.<p>As a landowner, you might think your day job is not “cutting it” and you want to branch out - we can help you here as well. Our platform lets you list your lawn real-estate and make some money out of it. If you are going to host more than one tent on your campsite, we will also help you do the logistics for that. For example, we will let people book a certain part of the land and there is a “locate my tent” function that helps people find their way back to their belongings. Even if they have bonded with locals and cannot make out your location further than the camp itself.<p>We are supposed to have the first prototype up and running by tomorrow evening. And you have an opportunity to help us out now, by LIKING and SHARING QuikCamp’s Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/Quikcamp) or just signing up early, to get the free night in a tent.",1440860091

Maybe, because good fragrances are associated with eatables, our mind categorised it to be a &quot;good&quot; fragrance.<p>Emotion is a mechanism developed by the brain to not spend energy reasoning things out every time. We understand this today and hence decide that emotion is a bias in the scientific method, but since we are humans and emotional by evolution/definition, we prove that bias did not occur by providing data for the experiment to be reproducible.<p>However, the evolutionary reason for the development of a particular emotion might not exist anymore.

10140131,comment,10138322,10140042,0,0,wpietri,,,"It has been 15 years since I&#x27;ve lived in Chicago, so it must have changed. At the time from the cab companies I heard about per-shift leases and drivers were very focused on making the nut, that being the amount to pay for the car&#x27;s use that (12-hour) shift. But I could see why cab companies would force a shift to longer commitments, as the drivers were pretty strategic about only picking up shifts where they were sure to make money. Great for drivers, but that could leave a lot of cabs sitting idle. And now that you mention it, I recall a few drivers who owned their own cab/medallion, and would time-share it with a couple of driver buddies; they were much more focused on maximizing road time. So I think I was too hasty above.<p>In SF I&#x27;ve certainly never heard a driver complain about a contract with the cab company or minimum hours, and given the number of complaints they have when you get them rolling, I figure I would have heard. But I&#x27;ll ask next I get the chance. And the complaints about dispatchers have gone down dramatically now that cabbies have other ways of getting passengers. Flywheel in particular is a big winner for everybody, and I wish some taxi commission had been forward-thinking enough to force a whole city into a universal dispatch with a clean API.",1440859612

No, matrices are just two-dimensional arrays of numbers. If you then define a specific &#x27;mutliplication&#x27; operation on those arrays, and a mapping from linear functions to matrices, it turns out that that multiplication operation is isomorphic to function application. That&#x27;s neat! But it doesn&#x27;t mean that that is what matrices <i>are</i>.<p>If you came up with an isomorphism from matrices to a domain where it made sense to define a different multiplication operation - like maybe placewise multiplication, where<p><pre><code>   [a b] * [e f] = [ae bf]\n   [c d]   [g h]   [cg dh]\n</code></pre>\nthen that would be just as valid, but it wouldn&#x27;t change what matrices &#x27;are&#x27;. In fact, because you know how to map matrices to linear functions, it would let you describe an operation to combine two linear functions in a new way and that might lead to some new insight about linear algebra!<p>It&#x27;s like how, in school you were taught that you can&#x27;t multiply vectors together. Yet, in shader languages, it turns out that it&#x27;s <i>really useful</i> to be able to multiply two vectors just by multiplying each component ([a,b][c,d]=[ab,cd]), so they define that as a valid operation.",1440859288

God forbid I ever come into the kind of money he has - but if I do, I pray I would have the courage to start from scratch to build the life that nourishes my spirit.<p>I think many will take a high position, point a finger at this man, and feel good about themselves.

So the physicists bounces particles off each other and see what happens to understand how these particles work.<p>Similarly, mathematicians study objects by looking how they act on other objects. So if it turns out that two differently defined objects have the same actions on other objects, we call them isomorphic and don&#x27;t really distinguish between them.<p>So for instance, we say that the set of rigid motions that preserve the triangle and it&#x27;s orientation is the same as the set of permutations of the roots of say: x^3-3x+1 even if the two sets are absolutely not defined in the same way.<p>Hope that makes some sense.",1440857001

Writing or refactoring existing code by using meaningful variable names can go a long way in increasing the readability of the code. I follow a simple rule to make my code easy to follow:\n1.variable names should indicate what they will be containing<p>2.name the function with atleast one verb denoting what the function does.<p>3.file names indicate what code in it is trying to do.<p>Small changes like this can help more than comments some times to understand and read code.<p>Finally code is meant for humans to read.

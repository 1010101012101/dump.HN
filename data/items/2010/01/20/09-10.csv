There are other benefits to RV parks, including the convenience of not having to run the generator for power, not having to dump and refill water, and probably having better Internet, so I'll probably end up staying in parks about 75% of the time. I'm paying $41.50, including utilities and Internet, per night here in Morro Bay, and this is a pretty pricey area; my house in Mountain View cost $71.50 per night, and didn't include utilities or Internet.

First, taking responsibility for the problem, and then offering to refund what the customer paid seems to disarm even the most vocal critics.  I mean, you don't usually get to keep the customer, but they usually stop saying bad things about you.<p>But really, being 'just a guy' is a little bit of a double-edged sword.  you want to be 'human' enough that you seem like a person and not some faceless corporation, but you also need to maintain enough emotional distance that you respond in a polite manner (or don't respond at all)  when someone insults the 'baby' you have spent the last 5 years of your life working on.",1263978810

And the answer is, generally, “Wherever you can park your car, I can park my RV; as long as it fits, doesn’t obstruct signage or right of way, and doesn’t spill into another space where spaces are marked.”  The law in most of California is that vehicles under 45 feet and used for non-commercial purposes can park anywhere any other consumer vehicle can park.<p>Interesting. This is not the case over here in Europe (at least in the parts of it I've been to). You get fined if you sleep overnight in your vehicle outside designated areas (like camping sites, specially RV-dedicated parking lots, etc., all of which you have to pay, of course).<p>EDIT: of course you can <i>park</i> everywhere, I was referencing ""sleeping"" part of the article.",1263978702

I might also bother my friend who's receiving them to ship them out to me next time I settle somewhere.

We'll definitely be doing OSCON, so I'll be in Portland in July. I don't think I'll make YAPC this year, since it is across the country and doesn't leave a lot of time to get back to the left coast for OSCON (my goal is to drive no more than six hours between stops and never stop for less than a week, since I do have work to do and can't be driving all the time).",1263978397

As we told you about last February, Apple's dynamic adaptive streaming allows mobile users to access their streaming music in a less bandwidth-intensive manner. For example, those with fast Wi-Fi, 3G or 4G connections would hear their streaming music in high-quality stereo while those with slower 2G or EDGE connections would hear their streaming audio in mono. The exciting thing here is that no matter what your mobile data speed is, you'll still be able to hear your streaming audio uninterrupted and without having to manually adjust any settings yourself.<p>Along with dynamic adaptive streaming, the company also announced today that it has more than 2 million mobile users, of which 56% are in the US and Europe. US users alone stream more than 30 million minutes of Bollywood and Indian Pop music per month. When all countries are combined Dhungana's users stream over 60 million minutes per month.<p>The Dhingana app is a free download and it's universal -- so it works both on iPhone and iPad. If you're bored listening to the same tunes you hear on the radio day in an day out, give Dhingana a try. It's a great way to discover new music and now with its dynamic adaptive streaming you'll never miss a beat.",1342033195

I think in recent years we got better but still far from perfect.<p>* We don't have Euro but we are pegged to Euro (de facto fluctuation 0%). IMHO in this regard we are similar to Greece - while we have freedom to change rate we have not used it.<p>* Both countries were not prepared for crisis if we compare them to Estonia as example.<p>In some aspects we were in very similar situation. Now what's different in my opinion: Austerity measures in Lithuania were very strict. We had so called ""Reforms night"" there our newly elected parliament made a lot of unpopular decisions (e.g. salaries decreased in public sector) and actually some of them of questionable long-term value while good in short-term (e.g. they cut payments for private pension funds what saved money in short-term but I have no idea what will happen in the future). Meanwhile in Greece it was really hard to do anything like that because everything they did was met with big opposition from society. As well little details like very early pension in Greece is not helping either. We had big buffer to go in debt without facing serious problem when borrowing money. Lastly we are still quite poor country and it is barely could be worse than it is sometimes :-) Greece is quite rich country.",1342032939

I don't play the same games on my phone that I play on my consoles or PC.  They're different experiences.  I expect different game experiences from an Xbox 360 than my PC.<p>Unfortunately, the perception that I have is that that when this system is released, it's going to be mostly ports of existing Android games.<p>The problem is that you shouldn't be getting those games for the system.  They were designed for touchscreens, not touchpads.  They weren't designed for controllers, and almost none of them actually have multiplayer.  Canalbolt, which is the featured ""Play on your TV"" image, is just a one-button runner.  Not anything I want to play on a TV.<p>So this means that for the OUYA to really succeed, they need games that are for the OUYA.  They shouldn't be be straight ports of Android games.  They should be unique experiences that utilize the OUYA's unique control scheme.  Success for the system is entirely dependent on the software available on it, and I just don't see that happening, especially with the short release cycle.",1342032838

There is an internet culture which violates taboos and cultural sensitivities in the most shocking way possible.  This culture is rooted in centers like 4chan, somethingawful, ebaumsworld, etc.  It is very much ""trolling"".<p>The goal is to spark the outrage.  Mission accomplished.  It is a mistake to think that the ideas they express are deeply held.  Rather than reflecting the personal beliefs of the troll, they are calculated to attack sensitivities.  The exact nature of the sensitivity is a reflection of the victim and not the perpetrators.<p>This is explicitly not <i>blaming</i> the victim.  The point is, it would be misleading to extrapolate a targeted campaign to make one person feel bad, in terms of that to which she is most sensitive, to society at large.<p>If she were a minority in some other respect, or had a physical disfigurement, or she had expressed some other sensitivity, it is my belief that the internet trolls would choose the most shocking violations of <i>that other sensitivity</i> to send her way. If I am correct, and you want to extrapolate this behavior to a larger society, focus on the aspect of ""trolling"" and not the specific manner in which this troll was executed.

Of course, his lawyers would still be free to bring the case to court, but it is very unlikely they would succeed.<p>Greg Dyke, on the other hand, runs the BBC , so to say he wilfully doesn't pay his TV licence could have a seriously detrimental effect on his career.

However, I pulled it back today because of the lack of a dev story for it. I was told by the Ouya official twitter account to just ""develop on another Android device"", which is a very shallow answer given the huge differences in gameplay between a touchscreen device and a gamepad device (and that gamepad-api isn't really viable yet). That suggests that they don't take the craft of game development seriously, and to me that doesn't bode well for the platform.<p>When they have development resources that show me that they're taking developers seriously, I'll revisit it (and doing so is fairly cheap for me; I'm using the always-awesome libgdx, which has Android support already). But my initial experience has been pretty bad, and I'm questioning their competency right now to the point where I can't give them money.",1342029684

It's like the Raspberry Pi, it's open in the sense that they tell you a little about it, I doubt you'll get schematics and data sheets on all the parts, but that's not the point.  The point is the price and the SDK and the attitude of the company promoting independent developers.",1342029632

6498306,comment,6497884,6498166,1,0,kyleashipley,,,"I agree with winslow that the main initial attraction is the novelty of the genre. I got into League of Legends a few years ago before DOTA2 was announced, and I find that it&#x27;s a bit more beginner-friendly and balanced than DOTA. (DOTA fan counter-point: League of Legends is overly simplistic and pay-to-play.)<p>Coincidentally, the League of Legends world championship final is occurring tonight. Anything you learn about the genre or strategy will apply somewhat to any game in the MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) genre, so check it out if you&#x27;re interested in learning more. Riot Games has hired an entire team of casters and analysts, and I find the commentary to be mostly insightful and enjoyable compared to American sportscasters.<p>To bring this on-topic: I wonder whether Valve will allow non-Steam games to run on SteamOS. League of Legends is directly competitive with Valve&#x27;s own DOTA2, but Valve has historically allowed you to use Steam purely as a launcher. My biggest fear is that this is yet another walled garden, just one that has embraced its digital nature sooner and better.",1380923973

By having a good understanding (precise model) of what you want to recognize, you could make some pattern recognition / object detection to be able to find it in other videos. 
But the huge problem in this field is that the conditions keep changing.
Light, luminosity, color, shape, distance. All of the makes pretty much every method of recognition of  &quot;it&quot; completely useless.<p>There is one thing you can currently do though.

Many people buy homes not based on such a calculation and simply because they have disposable income and owning a home is nice. Many people also buy homes based on neither financial decision-making nor disposable income, and I seem to recall this having some negative impacts on our economy a few years back, which may make it a poor analogy to why it makes sense to buy a Tesla (or a porsche?!) without disposable income.",1380923697

6498257,comment,6496030,6496854,2,0,leoc,,,"I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the whole story. It&#x27;s true that companies often buy cost-effective but unsexy computer hardware for their employees (viz. Dell). But back when the Macintosh was getting its market-share crushed by good-enough Win95 PCs, consumers were behaving in a similar price-conscious way. (Though the crashiness of late System 7 probably helped to loosen emotional attachments to the Mac as well.) In fact the Mac had famous bulwarks of continued demand in the institutional education market and among graphics and other &quot;creative&quot; professionals.<p>However, the situation <i>is</i> different in some ways that favour Apple this time. The shift to smaller, portable devices like the iPod, iPhone and iPad really seems to help Apple to sell premium products, because probably many more people are tempted to choose their phone on emotional (or quality) grounds than their PC. First, people tend to associate the PC with &#x27;work&#x27; - in particular, with grinding office documents for work - or with utilitarian duty as a thinnish client for the Web. And unlike a desktop box which sits mostly hidden under your desk, you touch, lift and look at your phone&#x27;s hardware many times every day. You also take it to public places where other people will get to know about and admire your lifestyle choice. (A laptop is roughly halfway between a phone and a desktop computer in these respects.) And a smartphone still generally costs less than a PC - the price of a whole iPhone after subsidy can easily be less than the price premium for a Mac over a PC. (Back in &#x27;96 a desktop computer cost even more than it does now, and better hardware specs could make a big difference to the quality of the user experience, so buyers had a compelling motivation to save their money and/or spend it on specs rather than OS polish or brand mystique.) In the iPhone Apple can sell a glowing, no-compromises &#x27;perfect thing&#x27; and at the same time sell it for a lot less.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that the march of good-enough Android isn&#x27;t going to squeeze Apple in future: I think it will.",1380923411

If you do care, you can&#x27;t effectively think about this problem without knowing about privilege, and how it affects your thinking.  For one thing, privilege is part of the problem directly.

I&#x27;ve been watching Nano Solar and their promise of $1/watt solar energy for years, and I have yet to see it in practice. I&#x27;d honestly love to be able to drop $50 on solar cells and know that I can produce 50 watts of power (at peak), but since Nano Solar is only selling to industry, the end consumer is left in the (coal) dust until this stuff catches on.<p>I guess ultimately, I&#x27;ll be watching this company now, too. Maybe I can become Walter White, and start &quot;cooking&quot; solar cells at home based on their article.",1380920712

They&#x27;re already entrenched several generations deep. For every kid getting an i-pod touch or i-pod nano today, in a few years, it&#x27;s such a seamless jump to an iphone. Nothing to learn, no additional software to learn, no new interfaces to spend time getting familiar with. It&#x27;s the same device, just with more functionality.<p>For me this is the most brilliant thing Apple has achieved. Being able to move a consumer from platform to platform with ZERO new investment on the users part? Genius.",1380920687

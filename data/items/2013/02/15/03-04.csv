This debate over things as trivial as a .6 mile discrepancy actually underscores the most damaging assertion that can be made against Tesla: that driving its vehicles in normal winter conditions requires some sort of finesse or special knowledge that most customers won't have. Niether end customers nor reporters should be expected to have deeper knowledge of the product they are buying/testing than the customer care agents who are assisting them.  Tesla needs to clean its house of bad customer care and accept responsibility for its role in Broder's bad experience.",1360900768

The test was supposed to simulate a normal driver, and a normal driver will absolutely do the minimum necessary. With gasoline -- a ridiculous energy rich substance that we can fill in just a few short minutes -- most of us still find the five minute fill up once a week or less a nuisance.<p>Tesla is actually contradicting themselves a bit: They berate him for not heeding the in-car predicted range, and then pat themselves on the back that it actually went 51 miles, and supposedly still had juice (apparently an accessory battery was dead). In other words, that what their engineers supposedly told him (that it would recover the <i>incredible</i> loss of power overnight, from 90 miles left to 20 miles left, once the batteries warmed up) was actually largely right.<p>Musk also makes a big show about him not turning down the temperature, when his own graph shows that not much further in the journey he turned it to the minimum for an extended period of time.<p>Reading both sides, I find Musk's heavy handed attack response incredibly unpalatable. He was so hasty in attacking, he ignored that his own data and his own claims in many ways supported the reporter.",1360900750

5224332,comment,5218288,5223044,2,0,lutusp,,,"> But that alternative usually requires driving at higher speed, which more than cancels out any gains from avoiding stop and go because of the increased loss from drag and friction.<p>No, this is a false choice. The choice should not be between stop-and-go driving, versus speeding along. For a proper evaluation, the tested alternatives should be (a) stop-and-go driving with an average velocity of V, versus (b) driving at a constant velocity of V. In that comparison, a constant velocity is much more efficient. The reason is that regenerative braking cannot recover more than a fraction of the energy lost to braking.<p>The above is in keeping with the best scientific practice, in which an experiment changes just one thing and keeps everything else the same. So we should choose an average velocity, then compare steady speed and stop-and-go driving at that velocity. In that experiment, steady speed wins.<p>> Metcalf's description does say that he accelerated and decelerated very gently ...<p>Doesn't matter. Adding a given amount of energy E to a moving object requires the same expenditure of energy regardless of how quickly or slowly it's done (although in practical examples, fast acceleration is wasteful for reasons outside the simplest explanation of the physics). It's the same with removing energy from a moving object, and it is here that the unavoidable losses in regenerative braking prevent the two cases from being equal.<p>> So he was trying to approach the ideal of driving at a steady 25 mph as close as he could.<p>That ideal is only achieved by maintaining a steady speed of 25 MPH, not by stop-and-go driving. It's not clear at this point whether Broder was actually told by someone at Tesla that stop-and-go driving was more efficient or not, but if so, that person needs an education.<p>> If the car's regen system had had lower losses, regen would have saved him some energy on those unavoidable decel/accel cycles.<p>Yes, but regenerative braking can only minimize losses, it can't recover all the energy lost to braking. Therefore a steady speed is more efficient.",1360900413

I can the logic for choosing it, thought it's not very solid:<p>- ""promotional material"" = advertising material (that promotes a product)<p>- ""discovery"" = discovery through recommendations from the page owner<p>- hence, ""promot-"" + ""discovery"" communicates ""advertising through recommendations""<p>However, ""promoted"" isn't quite the same thing as ""promotional"". What's actually happening is that promotional material is being presented as ""recommendations from the page owner"". The ""discovery"" itself isn't ""promoted"" (what does that even mean?). Most importantly, ""promoted"" doesn't contain the implication of advertising/sponsoring that ""promotional"" does.<p>It would have been more accurate to call this Sponsored Discovery or, to be even more real, Sponsored Recommendations.

Insulin (and the lack thereof) is tied in up-down regulation of lots of other hormones. Glucagon, for one, would always be higher in your body meaning you'd be prone to break down your body's fat stores. While that might actually be a positive side effect, I wouldn't be surprised if there were many negative side effects too.<p>Still, the side effects from this hypothetical hormone imbalance is very likely a huge improvement over constantly having advanced glycation end-products slowly destroying your body (which is what slowly happens to us type 1 diabetics).",1360900195

At the time, I was 19 years old and I had given up a one-way ticket to Hawaii, where I was going to transfer to another Dave and Buster's. I decided that even in paradise, I didn't want to work for those assholes anymore. So I packed up about 1/10 of my belongings (what I considered valuable: my violin, some clothes and a ton of beads). When I got to SF, I instantly made friends. I was drawn to the ones who didn't like begging- the buskers and merchants. I slept in the park every night for months. I wandered Haight & Ashbury- at night. Yes, I got robbed by the Fillmore Kids once, but I deserved it for selling on their turf. I never got in any fights, nor did any of the kids I was hanging with. I never even had anything stolen (not that I had anything to steal). The whole point is to be totally detached from society. Looking back, I think it should have been scary, but it wasn't. It was fun. I got to play my violin all day and sing Janice Joplin to the gypsies at night by campfire on Ocean Beach. I met some fascinating characters. One kid had joined a cult. When they refused to let him play jazz piano, he decided that working in a vegan-bakery-sweat-shop run by jesus freaks wasn't for him. He collected rocks and must have been really fucking strong because he had the heaviest pack I have ever held. At least he could be sure that no one would steal that thing! There were a lot of kids with psychosis there, too. One kid wrote poetry all day and occasionally sang to himself. When I asked him what he was saying, he'd say, ""a song I wrote for you."" Though the sentiment was sweet, he didn't write it. It was 'Tangled Up in Blue' by Bob Dylan. It was ALWAYS 'Tangled Up in Blue'. I thought the comment about ""respecting the spot,"" was interesting, too. We really do that. No one is greedy. If we feel we've made enough cash for beer or cigarettes, we leave. I've even had other kids tell me about a good busking stop they had just left vacant. ""Warmed it up for ya."" It's easy to see why this lifestyle is so appealing. However, the same cannot be said of why it's a lot less dangerous than most would think. But I lived it and I can tell you, I never felt unsafe in the HAIGHT (I emphasize Haight because I did venture to a soup kitchen near Polk and Geary and that was fucking terrifying). Despite any negative feelings some of the gypsies might have toward the cops, the police generally go easy on the stray kids because they know they keep the real crime out of the tourist area. \nIn the end, I got bored of that life and moved to Austin to pursue music. I'm still a gypsy at heart, but I also care a lot about the real world. These kids don't have any opinions on real events and feel no sense of loyalty to society. They're not dangerous, they're just just freeloaders. Plain and simple.",1360899457

A free market would mean everyone sees all of the costs of the health care they receive, and weighs the costs against the expected benefits, and only buys health care for which the expected benefits exceed the costs. Nobody that participates in employer-provided health care (which is most workers in the US) does that; the only costs they see are their portion of the premiums and their copays, so they want whatever health care has a benefit to them that exceeds those costs.<p>The provider side of the US health care system is not a free market either; a person can't just decide to be a provider. Doctors, nurses, x-ray technicians, etc., etc., all have to be licensed by the government. That is supposed to help guarantee that they are competent, but it also helps to keep costs higher by restricting the supply of providers. (To some extent there are now private clinics trying to end-run around this for basic services like blood pressure or cholesterol screening; but they are limited, and mostly serve people who don't have employer-provided insurance.)<p>In short, the US health care system is not an example of a free market system that achieves less optimal outcomes than a government system; it's an example of a bastardized part-government part-private system that achieves less optimal outcomes (by some metrics--by others, for example wait times for critical surgeries, it achieves better outcomes) than a government system.",1360898273

Maybe this is because of the sheer quantity of text (very hard ont he eyes), but after browsing the site nothing tells me why I should select your service rather than go Google ""chat services.""<p>--SMBs are your target market. But, the people who run these businesses do not have the time to sit and chat with customers. They are bound to look at this and feel they have no time to do it and give up.<p>My advice:<p>--Tighten up the website. Less text, more images, clearer value proposition. Why is TrackChat the best option?<p>--Show me numbers. If I'm a website owner, I'm craving to read about how another business made more money or improved conversion rates doing this.<p>--Pursue potential partnerships with a service business that can support you. If you can connect businesses to people who can operate these chats, your value to customers multiplies exponentially.<p>--After the above, develop and execute an acquisition plan ASAP. SEM is going to be your best option. Remember, your customers don't need technical sophistication; it's going to be hard for you not to indulge your engineering instincts but you have to realize your customers just need an application that is easy to set-up, works consistently, and does what it says it will.<p>This has potential if you can tighten up the site experience and are willing to make the investment in bringing in customers.

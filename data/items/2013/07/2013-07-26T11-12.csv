For that kind of money I&#x27;d expect them to hire an expert, not a newbie.<p>And 100% remote? Sweet! A little too sweet, actually. Something sounds fishy about this.<p>When a job offer sounds too good to be true, it often is, in my experience. Without a signed contract, words are just words. Yes, it&#x27;s annoying and humiliating, but it happens all the time in business. Welcome to the real world.<p>I would advise the applicant to put this behind him and move on.

6107702,comment,6106029,6106029,1,0,ajiang,,,"So now we have the Uber for housecleaning, laundry/dry cleaning, cooking, shopping, babysitting(?), and at some point everything else under the sun that falls into the consumer home services umbrella. These business use technology and economics of scale to deliver convenient on-demand services at a reasonable price, with the thesis that the price becomes increasingly more reasonable with continued local density and national scale.<p>Is there a path to this where a large home services company is formed as a roll up of all of these types of services? Once the actual services and logistics models are proven and ironed out, it would at least on the surface appear to be many major benefits to a roll up: additional scale economies from logistics / transportation, cross-training and utilization of the service workforce, single platform for payment, cross selling services, and of course your run of the mill shared services among legal, HR, accounting, etc. I think to me the point on cross training and utilization of the service workforce is especially poignant, as these services see a lot of demand volatility, so having multiple service lines help smooth out labor productivity.",1374839889

6107671,comment,6104571,6106383,5,0,flaviusb,,,"Two points:<p>1) The general (non-Marxist) idea is not that &#x27;the market price is unfair, so we should set different prices ourselves&#x27;, but rather that the market isn&#x27;t magic, and does not appear ex nihilo, but is impacted by many things. Some of those things (such as law about hiring, firing, welfare, safety, and so on) can materially affect the negotiation in a way that is patently not fair. For example, if unions had the kinds of powers some ascribe to them (ability to set wages however high they wanted with all staff being unfirable no matter what they did, with employers being powerless slaves) that would be obviously unfair. The power dynamic in many countries (including the US) is roughly that slanted at the moment, but in favour of employers rather than employees - in the US, for example, this is the effect of things like no cause firing, binding arbitration agreements, &#x27;temp&#x27; positions and &#x27;internships&#x27; being allowed to be offered in place of actual jobs, no real socialised healthcare, limited unemployment insurance in most states, low minimum wages, no &#x27;union shops&#x27; in most states, anti union laws, limited occupational health and safetly laws in many states, and so on. So, to make things &#x27;fair&#x27;, these things have to be fixed - then the market will be &#x27;fair&#x27;.<p>2) The general (Marxist) idea is not that &#x27;the market price is unfair, so we should set different prices ourselves&#x27;, but rather that capitalist-worker relationships are always unfair and exploitative due to the worker always having to sell their labour for wages, rather than capital, where the capitalist simply gains more money through the actions of capital - neatly setting up a coercive power structure. The (tl;dr version of the) Marxist response is not that this means that we have to set &#x27;better&#x27; or &#x27;fairer&#x27; levels for wages, but that we have to destroy capitalism and abolish wage slavery.",1374839161

   My daughter broke the time line, though, by pointing out

   give the author props for inventing the idea of the

   work, but it&#x27;s witty.

   As in the case of Andy&#x27;s father the real reason Pixar 
   films contain references to other Pixar films is rather 
   mundane. It&#x27;s only because somebody thought it would be  
   funny and the director agreed. In the cases of things like 
   John Ratzenberger&#x27;s voice and the Pizza Planet Truck, 
   it&#x27;s  tradition and a challenge.

Youre optimizing for reliabilitynot surprising, youre an investornot for where the need is greatest.<p>Perhaps once youve made a lot of money you could afford to optimize for where the need is greatest instead of reliability and fund tech startups tackling problems less familiar to their founders or founders from different backgrounds. This will probably be more risky but greater needs should produce greater rewards, right?",1374836648

One of the big debates is whether compelled disclosure of a password is information (high protection) vs. access (low protection).  Marcia Hofmann from EFF talked to a few people at Hope for about an hour on the finer points in specific situations.",1374836552
6107551,comment,6106029,6106669,2,0,bloodorange,,,"I had to go to the doctor recently. Among the &#x27;tests&#x27; he did was to check different parts of my chest with a stethoscope (and noted that there was a mild wheeze). Another was gently pressing particular points on my throat and asked me if it hurt. He also checked how the ears, nose and throat looked by using a bright light pointed towards them. Overall he checked for a variety of things and some of them involved physical contact.<p>I think it would have been hard for him to do this over a video call or have the same confidence in his diagnosis if he were not able to do these &#x27;tests&#x27; even if his diagnosis were the same.<p>I myself would find it hard to feel comfortable with diagnosis that I receive over a video session. In fact unless the whole pipeline for transmitting sound from one end to the other is very good, the doctor might miss some vital clues. I say this because I once saw him mention a faint whistling sound in my wife&#x27;s breathing from a few feet away (which we had not noticed until he pointed it out to us). How could he notice something small like that over a video call? How could a patient be confident that the doctors are not missing something like that over the call?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind receiving consultation regarding legal, financial or technical (Programming?) matters over a video call but I don&#x27;t see being comfortable receiving medical consultation through a video call.<p>[Edit: replied to wrong post earlier, deleted that and pasted here]",1374836535

I just find the door fixation obnoxious.<p>As a counterpoint, I usually reach towards cars.  Most are very similar to each other, yet as someone that used to have to rely on rentals, the first 2 minutes in any car are spent making sure I know how to do all of the basics.  The myriad ways to control a windshield wiper, adjust the brightness of the inner lights, reset trip timers, etc, is quite impressive.  Same for the radio and its highly varied functions.",1374836473

Ideas are created in the bizarro vacuum of that specific locale and fail to meet the needs or wants of the populace as a whole.  But -- given the easy flow of capital the last several years -- it&#x27;s easy to argue that everything is going swimmingly and there is no problem.

5196169,comment,5182765,5182765,1,0,DividesByZero,,,"I did this for three months with Geddit, but mostly on creating the MVP with my cofounder rather than sales.<p>Unlike mindcrime, my employer did not know what else I was working on, and I did no work on my startup during 9-5 business hours. I had to keep everything absolutely separate - not so much as IMing my cofounder about the startup during working hours. I did keep a personal journal a work where I would write down ideas and other startup related things, as well as general thoughts, but that was it.<p>The 9-5 job was mind numbingly boring, and occasionally pretty stressful. I developed some tactics to make sure I kept going with the startup while still doing my 9-5 well. Firstly, I developed a routine together with my cofounder, and stuck to it religiously. 9 to 5, we were at our day jobs. 6 to 7 we were at the gym. 8pm we had had dinner and were ready to work on a weeknight. Work had a midnight curfew, no matter what. This helped to establish compartmentalised parts of the day, as well as an effective transition between one and the other. At my 9-5, I could focus on my job since I knew no startup business would enter. Weekends were devoted entirely to startup work, or leisure activities about twice a month.<p>Secondly, we established a goal where we could switch to working on the startup full time. For us this was saving the money needed to move to Berlin plus 6 months runway. Having this in our sights made the harder parts of the three months more bearable because we knew we were working toward a determined fixed goal. We were able to execute on our MVP through this sort of discipline and successfully switched to working full time on Geddit.<p>This stuff was very tough, but I had the support of my awesome cofounder and we had each other's backs. If you're going at this alone your mileage may vary, but we managed to succeed on the 'nights and weekends' route, at least for some time.<p>Eventually you'll have to switch to working on your idea full time - probably sooner than you feel comfortable - but it'll be worth it.",1360497476

5196161,comment,5195312,5196114,14,0,nagrom,,,"My own feeling is that Germans guard quite strongly their societal and cultural goods; advanced degrees are a status indicator and it's not a surprise that incorrectly-gained degrees cause outrage to me. Perceived pollution in the shared consciousness inevitably causes punishment and expulsion.<p>Other ways in which Germans guard their societal structure:<p>-- highly regulated Sunday opening hours, even in big cities, ostensibly to protect low status workers.<p>-- strong rules regarding jay walking; it's the only country where other pedestrians got upset with me for crossing the street incorrectly.<p>-- strict adherence to rules and procedures in aspects of life that most cultures don't care about (clear your sidewalk of snow and ride your bicycle only on the correct side of the sidewalk, for example).<p>-- strict adherence to a close family model that promotes appropriate education, shared meals and shared community endeavours.<p>All these things make up a strong societal structure (if a little inflexible). I believe that there is a national desire for a straightforward, trustworthy communal structure. The 'obsession with titles' is simply a facet of the desire for a strong shared community which can act as a basis for a productive society. If people assume titles that they do not deserve then they reduce the quality of societal markers, make communal life more difficult and thus reduce productivity and progress. Add that to the somewhat natural tendency to tear apart any person of previously high societal status, and you have the current climate of Germans checking all advanced degrees (and to an extent, the British checking all the expenses claims of their own politicians).",1360497296

To remain in a circular orbit over the airless moon, no thrust is required at all. Read this for a full explanation:<p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/gravitation_equations/orbital_mechanics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/gravitation_equations/orbital_mechanics...</a><p>> The biggest problem seems like it would be the centrifugal force.<p>Not centrifugal force (a fictional force) but centripetal force, the force produced by the craft's parts being forced to turn against a natural tendency to move away in a straight line. Which, given the problem's velocity, they will begin to do in short order after tearing themselves to pieces.<p>> It might be possible to overcome this force, especially with a smaller payload.<p>Not in the described scenario -- even a tiny payload would disintegrate upon touching the surface at orbital velocity. Consider that the orbital velocity for a lunar circular orbit is 1.2 km/s or almost 2700 miles per hour -- that would be Mach 3.5 if there were any air available to give that meaning. Given the proposed approach angle, the contact velocity is nearly the same as the circular orbit velocity given above. There's no way that a craft can safely dissipate that kind of kinetic energy by simply rolling along the lunar surface.<p>It's way too fast, too much kinetic energy, the idea isn't practical.

Furthermore these theses most often had been written in ""the old days"", and were available only on special request from a few libraries where they were collecting dust for years in some non-publicly-accessible storage room for books no one ever borrows.<p>But then came Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg, whose thesis (written just 2007) started the whole debate about misgotten degrees in 2011. He had dismissed all charges about having cheated with unprecedented arrogance. Even though claiming to live up to higher standards, himself being a whealthy aristocrat, he had wholesale-copy-pasted the whole work from undisclosed sources, some even produced by the parliament's research service for him.<p>By additionally handling the resulting public-relations disaster pretty inapt, he gave a unbelieveably strong boost to the plagiatism-finders, who normally would have been ridiculed as nickpicking footnote and quotation-mark-counters. Now they were the judges for the integrity of a large number of public persons.<p>Anette Schavan is only one of many persons accused of copying a relatively few paragraphs in her thesis, not even on the same scale as Karl-Theodor, this theses would never have created the current public outcry if not preceeded by Karl-Theodor's.<p>And she's even defended by a lot of academics that claim that this amount of un-disclosed copying, 30 years ago, would be on a level that's would not warrant the whole process that has now started and led to her demissal. I mean, she probably has written that manuscript on a mechanical typewriter, with drafts written by hand, not assisted by a software marking handling quotations automatically!<p>But universities are under a high pressure to show a merciless approach in re-evaluating these theses, and unfortunately there isn't even a limitation-period after which given titles would be incontestable, and hence what appears to be the current obsession with titles in Germany.<p>-- References :-)<p>- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Theodor_zu_Guttenberg#Doctorate_plagiarism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Theodor_zu_Guttenberg#Doct...</a><p>- The ""Guttenplag"" wiki has a graph (and statistics): 94% of pages, 64% of lines have copies of foreign text without attribution:\n <a href=""http://de.guttenplag.wikia.com/wiki/GuttenPlag_Wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.guttenplag.wikia.com/wiki/GuttenPlag_Wiki</a><p>- This side shows pages in red that contain foreign material without attribution:\n   <a href=""http://schavanplag.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schavanplag.wordpress.com/</a>",1360495268

Positive, perhaps, but the survival of the species doesn't rest on gender equality. For long periods of history the human race has not had gender equality, and we've survived it. No-one has ever proven that our continued existence (or even prosperity) rests on recognising the rights of others.<p>- Most societies for most of history were less hostile to homosexuality than the modern West<p>I'm fairly certain that this is simply wrong too. While there have been some societies in history that have been ambivalent or positive towards homosexuality, the vast majority of societies through history have treated homosexuality as deviant behaviour that should be shunned - most societies that are dominated by Christianity or Islam (which, for obvious reasons, tend to be the societies with the best and most available records) have treated homosexuality as a terrible sin.

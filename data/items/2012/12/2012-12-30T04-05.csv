""It will be broken soon enough"". To this day, it is not possible to boot alternative kernels on many moto devices, save for some sort of rebooter with kexec or because an engineering bootloader (signed of course) was leaked or it's one of the handful of devices that the Motorola unlock tool supports.<p>I'd love to be wrong, I promise you, but if MS has done their homework right and looked at what others have done, it ought to be close to possible. (Also note that the primary way of compromising the Xbox these days requires electrically glitching hardware. I suppose something similar could be devised for a targeted ARM device but it seems less likly given the cost/benefit that mjg referenced).",1356843565

In fact it's bad - it's highly inefficient.<p>I think micro-managing often implies a lack of trust where you're not sure an employee will 'do the right thing' to resolve a customer issue.<p>Really with a team you should be constantly letting them take more responsibility & resolving unusual instances together, this means you never have to repeat instructions for the same task twice. Continue long enough & you are only pulled into the loop for the odd anomaly.<p>I think this way of working builds great morale within a customer service team. The best managers remove obstacles for their team which enables them to provide awesome service.<p>Sometimes, simply asking your team ""what common tasks are we're duplicating brain power on?"" ""where can I give you more responsibility?""<p>You may find the answers you get are really simple to implement, like ""allow me to issue refunds under $10 as I ask you 10x per week for this""<p>Sure, maybe you get them to keep a refund log & you review it weekly but it shows that with good performance they'll create a role where they are free to use their initiative without fear of being punished.<p>If you create a culture where they continually look to you for instruction they are never going to step outside of that.

However, this could change if iOS continues to slip in market share and developers focus their efforts on other platforms.<p>What if Apple allowed developers to enter into an agreement with them wherein Apple's cut of the revenue would be only 15% if their apps were exclusive to iOS? This would incentivize developers to focus their development on iOS which could be more profitable than having the app on multiple platforms (as far as I know iOS is still the better platform for monetizing apps). App Store revenue is an immaterial amount to Apple and it would likely be worth it to strengthen the moat around iOS.<p>My question is would such an arrangement be considered anti-competitive by regulators? I can't think of any precedents related to this other than exclusive games for PS3/Xbox 360, though I'm unsure if Sony or Microsoft does anything to incentivize it or if it's simply developer choice.",1356841743

The steps of making coffee there is: Get the cup size the customer asked for, add cream/milk, add sugar, and then pour the coffee to the top. If you're going to do the whole 'a medium but in a large cup', the person behind the counter is just going to guess when he should stop and depending on the person, you might get more or less. Also if you keep asking them to make it like that, you'll eventually piss everyone off and end up getting a lot less.<p>If you want to get more for your buck at Dunkin' Donuts, go when they are about to close and ask for donuts and bagels.

Plus the multitude of wizards and tools for making tasks ""easier"" were just an abomination and very often did not work.<p>And I always hated RedHat's automatic update tool which would read update information from a central server but search for the RPMs on a different mirror then - because very often those mirrors were not in sync.<p>Here is to you, Patrick!",1274777730

That said, I find it annoying in emacs to write code that uses menus because what I would <i>like</i> to do is build the menu and attatch a closure to the different ""buttons"".  Since I couldn't find a way to get callable closures using the cl package I ended up writing some kind of global button-position table.  Yuck.<p>As to your point about ""global variables suck"", people say a lot of misinformed things.  The problem with global variables has always been the inability to detect their access.  If a variable has a value you didn't expect, it's not lexical so you can't just read the code and it's not dynamic so you can't just check the stack for the culprit.<p>Ironically, the main thing our OO saviour has really brought us is the ability to limit the scope of our global (member) variables.  With big classes you still have the issue of figuring out what in-scope method changed the member variable, and I've sorely missed dynamic scoping for member varialbes many time (e.g. anytime you use a finally block to make sure the variable gets set back, you could have just used dynamic scoping).",1274777112

1376842,comment,1376293,1376573,0,0,idiopathic,,,"The founders at our company are all remote, with developers spread across India, UK and USA. We are doing well, having won Seedcamp last year.<p>It still amazes me the visceral reaction people have against remote working. This would be fine as a principle, if the same people did not also complain to me that doctors do not embrace technology. But given that our platform is designed for doctors and patients to work together online (including online consultations) it behooves us to practice what we preach.<p>I will give the following tips:
- You need different habits to work online. In my case, I have a <i>lot</i> of experience in setting up teams to work together virtually based on all my previous IT projects, including writing software for medical students to share their education across hospitals using Palm Pilots, and migraiting 300 employees to use a wiki. I also worked as a management consultant in a company that took pride in working with 2,700 hospitals but without traveling to the hospitals - all research was through phone and email.
- You have to teach the rest of the team these habits, few people know them already. For example, in a telephone conference, you have to explicitly laugh when you would have smiled, as you cannot rely on visual cues for bonding.
- Make use of wikis and document every meeting you have, as you have it, with everyone seeing what you type as you type it.
- my co-founders were either people I knew, or people I got to know in person through volunteer work I would ask them to do over coffee meetings before I asked them to join the company.<p>By far the biggest saving we have is time. It is not being cheap and cutting costs of office space, it is about slashing the time we spend on commuting and meeting, and I would definitely say that we would never have achieved as much as we did, as quickly as we did, if it was not for working virtually.",1274776145

1376838,comment,1374660,1374660,0,0,rlpb,,,"> 1) Cheap branches. Subversion has cheap branches.<p>I think what people might mean by cheap branches is that git does cheap <i>local</i> branches. You can work in your own private space and only when you are ready commit the whole thing (reworked if necessary) to a central repository or otherwise publish it. The outcome is that commits are seen by the outside world (whether centralised or decentralised) as a set of complete logical steps to get from A to B. The history ends up showing the evolution of a program getting better. If in future a regression is discovered, it is easier to find and fix by using the history to find the logical step with an error and fixing just that.<p>With svn you have to create a branch on the central repository which will remain in history forever more. Whether or not this is a good or bad thing, the outcome is that fewer people do this way. Of course it happens for major features, and for private branches. However for private branches it happens less. Some try and do everything in one big commit instead of using individual logical steps. More people make mistakes and then have to commit corrections later. The outcome is that commits are seen by the outside world as a bunch of random not-necessary-logical steps and corrections as the programmer worked out how to solve the problem. This puts more errors and inconsistencies into the history, making it less useful.<p>> 2) Fork and hack without all that overhead of connecting with the community.<p>This is where git shines. The community often won't accept a patch first time. They'll discuss it and ask for modifications and improvements. git integrates with this really well, since you can rebase in your private branch often and submit new revisions of a particular patch, and this is all integrated into the revision control system. svn simply has nothing that can compare.<p>> 3) No central repository.<p>No requirement for a central repository. As you point out, git can be arranged in a way that uses one.<p>The difference between git and svn is that svn is just a means of maintaining a central repository. git is a tool that can do this <i>but also helps you work on your own code in an integrated manner before you publish it</i>.",1274776027

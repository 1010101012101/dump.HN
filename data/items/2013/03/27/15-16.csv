I suggest both. Once you learn one, it's very easy to pick up the other. As much as their similar, their library support and tools make them useful for different purposes as much as the same purposes. To go into a little detail, if you're building a website with some offline or non-web aspects, go with Python. If what you want to build is entirely on the web, go with Ruby on Rails / Sinatra. With these skills, you can build awesome web apps and tap into the huge library support of Python for non-web related issues.<p>Finally, you just have to learn Javascript if you want to dive into web. Start with pure Javascript, some jQuery and pick a library (Backbone, Ember etc...) and learn it.",1364399992

5450156,comment,5448923,5448923,7,0,eeeeaaii,,,"I would have agreed with this up until about a year ago.  But I've recently discovered a new way of thinking about the development process that IMO is far superior, and more importantly, far healthier in the long run.<p>The way I used to think about development was that there were separate phases: building, debugging, then launching, then you stop working on it because it's ""done.""  Then, I suppose, you go on vacation and sip Mai Tai's on the beach.<p>The thing is, once you get rid of the ""done"" phase, your whole perspective changes.  The other three phases (building, debugging, launching) get mixed together in a blender.  Suddenly, any time you hack something, it's okay because you're going to fix/change/refactor it later.  It's all part of one big growing, changing, process -- a process that actually fits with the literal meaning of the term ""development.""<p>So it's not about pride anymore for me, it's about humility.  These days, when I build something, I start off hacking something together in the quickest way possible, no matter how ugly.    Then I just keep iterating, refactoring, fixing, cleaning: improving, improving, improving.  So there is never a moment when you proudly show off a gleaming, fancy product and say ""look, I'm done!""  There's always something that works, something that doesn't -- something that needs to be completely rewritten, something that looks good and you haven't touched in months (or years).<p>The great thing about doing this is that it's a good way to keep yourself from being an ""architecture astronaut.""  If you start with a hack and build refactoring into your process from the very beginning, you'll never build out more architecture than you need, because every time you use a design pattern it will be a direct response to a real need, not an imagined future need.<p>To conclude, I'll leave you with this quote from Walt Whitman, talking about the ""deathbed edition"" of ""Leaves of Grass"" -- a book he revised nine times during his life, which grew from 12 poems to 400 during his lifetime.<p>""L. of G. at last completeafter 33 y'rs of hackling at it, all times & moods of my life, fair weather & foul, all parts of the land, and peace & war, young & old""<p>Not sure what ""hackling"" means, but it sure sounds a lot like hacking!",1364399950

5450154,comment,5449525,5450111,9,0,bhauer,,,"At least with respect to checked exceptions, my read of modern popular convention is simply to avoid using checked exceptions unless there is a very strong use-case.  In our own code, we have transitioned to using predominantly unchecked exceptions with no decrease in code quality that we have yet perceived.<p>Agreed on assuming the trivial getters and setters if they are not expressly defined.  That would be nice.<p>As for modifying variables in lambdas, you need to have a final reference available, meaning you can't modify a primitive.

Why, compared to operators, would a function name be any better than an operator? Mathematics are part of computer science, and denying basic operators for a reason like ""because someone might misuse them"" is like denying functions because someone may implement a sum() and call it lcm() (and then we're back to goto land). You're confusing a programmer's error (bad choice of a name/operator function) with a language feature.

As in, seen an official statement or reviewed the actual deal docs?  Because as of now it seems like the only actual source for that number is Kara Swisher on AllThingsD, and that's her saying ""sources tell her"".<p>I ask because I wonder if one of the big twists in this story is that, perhaps, Yahoo didn't actually pay $30M. Maybe they paid $10M. Or $1M. And perhaps this whole shebang is a big, big PR blitz -- that's working spectacularly.<p>Folks pay $2M for 30 seconds of Super Bowl ad time. This story has, so far, gotten Yahoo a LOT more than 30 seconds of exposure. It's everywhere (my extremely non-technical and non-nerdy biz partner emailed me an AP news link this morning - he's my ""masses"" filter).<p>One question I have is - what would the consequences be if they did leak an incorrect amount?  I mean, would shareholders have a right to be upset? ""You leaked to the world that we paid $30M and in reality, we...we...got a better deal?  Oh.  Cool.""<p>It reminds me of a joke I have with some friends about an acquisition someone did a few years ago.

Probably some have technical reasons behind, but...<p>- Getters and setters, C# style. That is, instead of<p><pre><code>    private int foo;\n    public int getFoo() { return foo; }\n    public void setFoo(int value) { foo = value; }\n</code></pre>\nwrite this:<p><pre><code>   public int Foo { get; set; }\n</code></pre>\nwhich is both easier to write and makes code more readable and understandable.<p>- Mandatory exception declarations in methods. I still don't understand why this is necessary. It ends up either leading to stupid errors (see the following example from the article)<p><pre><code>    void appendAll(Iterable<String> values, Appendable out)\n            throws IOException { // doesn't help with the error\n        values.forEach(s -> {\n            out.append(s); // error: can't throw IOException here\n                       // Consumer.accept(T) doesn't allow it\n        });\n    }\n</code></pre>\n, or to lots of methods just throwing Exception (bad practice, I know, but it's easy to fall in), or to useless empty try-catch on methods that won't throw an exception (because you've checked it) and don't want to add the throw declaration.<p>- Modifying external variables in a lambda expression. Just as everyone is used to in Javascript, Ruby, C#... It's pretty useful, even more when you're using lamdbas for common operations such as <i>forEach</i>.<p>- Operator overloading. When you're using data classes (for example, models from a database) where different instances actually point to the same object, overriding == it's more comfortable than <i>foo.equals(bar)</i>. Also, the downside of using <i>.equals</i> is that, if <i>foo</i> is null, you will end up with a nice NullPointerException out of nowhere.<p>- Events! I'm amazed how easy is to do events in C# versus how hard (and bloated) in Java. Take this as an example: <a href=""http://scatteredcode.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/from-c-to-java-events/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scatteredcode.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/from-c-to-java...</a><p>- Pass by reference.

5450030,comment,5448065,5449442,3,0,nandemo,,,"I hear you. When I started learning Haskell I was also somewhat frustrated by some error messages. But it's far from an insurmountable problem, if you're really interested in learning the language. My suggestion is,<p>(i) use ghc and ghci. TryHaskell isn't actively mantained AFAIK.<p>(ii) if you find a cryptic error message, first google it and learn the immediate fix, without trying to understand all the details. Of course, eventually you'll have to learn the details, but there's no reason it should be a blocking issue in the beginning.<p>In any case this is my short-ish, inaccurate version of ""the details"":<p>1. In the interpreter, there's an implicit ""print foo"" when you type ""foo"".<p>2. ""print foo"" expects a <i>foo</i> of any type <i>t</i> as long as <i>t</i> is an instance of the typeclass Show, meaning there must be a <i>show</i> function associated with <i>t</i> that turns <i>t</i>'s into <i>String</i>s. Roughly, that would be as if we had a Java where the method <i>toString</i> (=show) is not part of Object, but rather of an interface Showable, which not all classes have to implement.<p>3. In Haskell, it was decided that function types shouldn't be instances of Show because they don't have a sensible <i>show</i> implementation. In theory you can have a <i>show</i> implementation that prints ""this is function"" for all functions, but that's of limited usefulness.<p>4. The compiler's error message is just an instance of a more general message: a value <i>foo</i> is used in a place that expects a type that's an instance of SomeTypeClass, but <i>foo</i> turns out to be of a type <i>T</i> that isn't. For instance, if you try this on ghci:<p><pre><code>    >  'a' + 'b'\n</code></pre>\nyou'll get a similar error message, because '+' expects 2 arguments of a type that's an instance of typeclass Num, but 'a' and 'b' are of type Char which is not a Num in Haskell.  In theory, the compiler could be ""hardcoded"" to print a special error message when SomeTypeClass happens to be Show, such as ""can't print that type"". That would be easier for beginners, but would add some complexity to the compiler.<p>5. The ""M1690418375.show_M1690418375"" thing is probably an artifact of the way TryHaskell was implemented. In ghci, you simply get this instead:<p><pre><code>     arising from a use of `print'\n</code></pre>\nI hope this helps.",1364398734

I don't think anyone has enough data to know the exact ""magic number"" but it's probably dependent on size. 10 to 15 in a year is fine; 100 shouldn't go past 120 in a year, in general.<p>What I think causes startups to fall to shit, culturally speaking, is a mix of three things:<p>(1) Culture is never made an explicit priority and evolution is ""by default"", which leads in a bad direction. Investors don't care (and shouldn't care) about company culture; founders would care but are too busy managing investors, and no one else has the power to do it, so power vacuums and fiefdoms emerge.<p>(2) Tiny equity slices motivate people in the wrong way. Larger profit-sharing slices are better. (<a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macleod-17-building-the-future-and-financing-lifestyle-businesses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macle...</a>) When the 25th engineer is offered 0.05%, vesting over 4 years, either (a) he doesn't care at all about such a puny slice, in which case you'd get more from him with a higher salary, or (b) he wants to become an executive and get a real slice. The toxic software politics (scorched-earth rewrites, calamitous tool wars) come directly from (b), as engineers bash each others' heads in to get real titles and meaningful equity. (They get hit with karma when they get there and find out that being an ""executive"" doesn't mean they can code but control the division of labor and take the good work for themselves, but, rather, that it means that their lives are wasted in meetings.)<p>(3) Sometimes without even knowing it, or without choice (VC interference) companies sell off their culture to hire external executives. The ""problem"" with Valve-style open allocation (e.g. employee autonomy) is that it's hard to hire the traditional entitled executive who's used to having 20 people who can't say ""no"". Google didn't lose its culture via executive hiring until <i>after</i> it grew large, but most startups begin that process much earlier.",1364397608

For scripting languages, make this a parameter of your script, so you can play with it quickly without having to change any code.<p>* b - STRING DATA - this is the value (or values) you will be comparing your regular expression against.  You can store this in a variable, or reference this from a text file.  Try and think of all cases that could potentially cause your script to break.  For example, the currency symbols you are trying to replace, could they ever be used in ways where you would not want to replace them?<p>* c - RESULTS - you should output the results every time you run your script and keep tweaking it until you are satisfied with the output.<p>3) Implement your awesome REGEX in your code.",1364397531

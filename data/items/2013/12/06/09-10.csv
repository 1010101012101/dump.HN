But the cost/benefit tradeoff is better than LXC; pip gets me <i>most</i> of the isolation with much, much less overhead.<p>Is the author really claiming that it&#x27;s easier to script a non-virtualenv deployment than a virtualenv one? If so, great, do that - the <i>only</i> reason I deploy with virtualenv is because, guess what, that&#x27;s easier to script.<p>Why default to --no-site-packages? Because it helps and it&#x27;s easy. No, I&#x27;m not perfectly isolated from my host system - but then the host system could have a broken libc and then nothing, not even LXC, is going to make your isolation system work. Just because you can&#x27;t isolate perfectly doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no point isolating as much as you can.<p>Yes, pip builds from source. That&#x27;s a lot more reliable than the alternative. The Java guys certainly <i>aren&#x27;t</i> mocking you if they&#x27;ve ever done the actually equivalent thing, i.e. deploy a library that uses JNI, which is a complete clusterfuck.<p>(URLs as dependencies are indeed a bad idea; don&#x27;t do that.

All of which simply do not apply with relational datastores. The thing I took away from your post is that had you used a 20-year-old relational datastore you would have 0 of your issues anyway.<p>> The advantages of schemaless documents are priceless. Not having to migrate is just one of the perks. Our schemas were largely in the form of Orders (having many) Shipments (going_from) ShipPoint (to) ShipPoint<p>You say priceless. I don&#x27;t think it means what you think it means. A migration is costly but also pretty rare. I migrate PostgreSQL with 100k+ rows as a matter of routine, it&#x27;s over before you know it. The schema you are using (orders have many shipments going from point to point) are easily expressed in a relational schema and once defined would hardly ever need to change, if at all during the lifetime of the application. So what if I need to add a column here or there. It won&#x27;t matter at all. Do you have more than 100 million documents in MongoDB? I guess you don&#x27;t. Even if you do, relational has that covered too.<p>> This doesn’t always have to be the case, though it significantly contributes to Mongodb’s fast writes.<p>What you are saying is that I need to change MongoDB in order to make it safe. Relational database are safe out of the box, no change necessary.<p>> We add a lot of Notes to each shipment [...] it doesn’t critically affect the business workflows of the application.<p>Say <i></i>what<i></i>?<p>You&#x27;re fine with data, even notes, being lost?

The core community shaping C over the years has been:<p>1. Unix-centric, so the community has a coherent view on the preferred sort of semantics offered to users of code;<p>2. Applies Kernighan--Ritchie--Pike coding style that gives a clear &quot;code smell&quot; [2] for C code; and<p>3. Is the natural home of &quot;Worse is Better&quot;, which favours source-code simplicity over specification simplicity.<p>For example, the &quot;C party&quot; favours procedures &quot;succeeding&quot; with non-zero exit codes on failure where other language parties have language constructs to represent failure.  This can be better from the point of view of source-code simplicity, both in code and compiler, than exceptions, and worse in terms of semantics.  The LK coding style, among many other C coding styles, prefers the use of goto (or sometimes setjmp/longjmp) to handle exit status [3], which is frowned upon in nearly all non-C programming language communities; the restriction of goto/longjmp to handling errors in this way avoids the problems Dijkstra pointed out [4,5], and correct usage of goto/longjmp in properly checking exit status has good code smell if generally accepted coding conventions for the use of goto to handle failure are followed.<p>There&#x27;s a nice fragment of code illustrating the idea on SO [6].<p>[1]: Pitman 1994, Lambda: The ultimate political party, <a href=\"http://www.nhplace.com/kent/PS/Lambda.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nhplace.com/kent/PS/Lambda.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell</a><p>[3]: From <a href=\"http://www.tux.org/lkml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a>: <i>So now we come to the suggestion for replacing the goto&#x27;s with C exception handlers. There are two main problems with this. The first is that C exceptions, like any other powerful abstraction, hide the costs of what is being done. They may save lines of source code, but can easily generate much more object code. Object code size is the true measure of bloat. A second problem is the difficulty in implementing C exceptions in kernel-space.

If, instead, I have to choose between usage patterns that give 8 or 9 days of power, respectively, I will certainly not give a damn.<p>Battery life is a perfect example of ""good enough"". Would it hurt so much to equip the phones with larger batteries instead of, say, 1500mAh that seems typical now.

We may have different definitions of what a startup is.<p>If by startup, you mean a one man website that is some kind of low-maintenance subscription service, then yeah sure, go travel the world.<p>But if you define startup as I do, as a venture-backed, aggressively growing company employing people, then how the hell are you going to travel the world while managing that?

I quite like the way it manages to remain moderately performant while also giving many of the benefits of dynamic languages.

The minimum is about $1,000 for a Mac Mini (perfectly good for most development) and two testing iPod touches, but you might even have some of those to start with.

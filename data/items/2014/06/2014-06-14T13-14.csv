During my first shoot for the NewsHour with one arm, I was wearing a blazer when I met a researcher I was to interview. She left the lab, and I took my jacket off. When she returned, it was a good thing she wasn’t sipping her coffee, because she would have offered up an amazing spit take. As we both looked at my stump, I shrugged and said, “It happens.”<p>I can relate with him on this. I lost the distal phalange of my left thumb when I was about 6. It is not very evident, but every once in a while colleagues discover that, and ask &quot;what happened to your finger&quot;.  My story has getting shorter and shorter as years pass... nowadays it just goes &quot;I lost it in an accident&quot;. I stil feel uncomfortable phasing that question.",1402754070

For one, in that context what information one shares is apparent and the impact of the information is more readily understood. This is not the case when large volumes of data are shared with unknowable powerful parties, used in unmonitored ways with effects that one cannot predict or control.<p>Secondly, we do not live in a small community, we have an incredibly interconnected world. Democracy does not function well when people lose the capacity to moderate access of information about ourselves, our thoughts and communications to some degree, when other parties may use that information against the individual. It stunts individual expression and that is pretty fundamental to living a modern society.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly naive to undervalue the need and importance of privacy.

Denmark, China, Germany are all countries making large investments in renewables which are likely to provide large returns.  Much of what can be done for climate change are investments with real returns, not just money sinks.<p>The tragedy of the commons you describe is real, of course.  A pound of coal burned in China does damage just like a pound of coal burned in Ohio.  And yet, the U.S. does quite well at pushing countries toward what it wants, in other areas.  Worldwide, the U.S. has pushed nearly every country toward supporting pro-U.S. copyright laws.  These laws hurt every other country, but the U.S. has been mostly successful at pushing them.  Is there some reason the U.S. would be unable to push climate laws, if it wanted to?  And at the various climate conferences, it's clear that many nations are ready and willing to combat climate change, but the U.S., Canada and perhaps a few other nations are strongly opposing any action.<p>Why should I not throw trash in the park?

Assuming your post (and this is a generous assumption) was to ask these questions in earnest, here is my best attempt at answering them:<p>1. What are you solving?<p>>> We are trying to create a ""better than email"" environment for ideas and insights, shared within teams. Email is great at task management, but orders content by recency, which means that important thoughts (that aren't time-sensitive) get lost in archives.<p>2. What are the tools that are currently being used?<p>>> Email. Google Docs. And sometimes teams use the writeboard within their project management application.<p>3. Why are they so horrible?<p>>> I've explained email above. Google Docs doesn't give you attribution and ownership over your ideas. It's also very poor at allowing you to organize your docs. Finally, it's also incredibly hard to add to a doc quickly from a mobile device.<p>4. Do people wake agonize over these treacherous solutions, ripping their hair out and wishing there was something better?<p>>> This doesn't need an answer. You're mostly just interested in hearing yourself speak here.<p>5. So who actually needs what youre building?<p>>> Creative teams (web design/dev shops, agencies, startups), Freelancers (part of many teams), Students & Educators (project groups and classrooms), Networked organizations (like YC who manage a portfolio of companies).<p>6. Have you talked to potential customers?<p>>> We're approaching 300 user interviews.<p>7. Have you reached out and gathered honest opinions?<p>>> Again. No answer required here.<p>The interesting thing about this experience (aside from the tremendously helpful feedback provided by some HN users), is that there seems to be this widely held assumption that branding and positioning a product are the ""easy"" parts.<p>People look at the fact that we've been at this for a year and a bit, and judge our progress, yet there is an endless amount of literature that's been created about how to do it well.

So it says that, based on the orders currently in the market's books, at the $6.00/Bitcoin price point, you could sell up to 23,282 Bitcoins to get $549,907. This trade could happen immediately, because the matching buy orders already exist.<p>Similarly, the blue curve is the 'ask' curve. It shows how many Bitcoins people are currently willing to sell at any given price. So right now, at the $8.00/Bitcoin price point, you could buy 19,242 Bitcoins at a cost of $144,682.<p>Obviously, you'd be stupid to do either of those trades because they're far from the market rate.

If someone were to put either a buy or sell order in between those numbers, then it would sit there until a match came in.<p>Which brings us to the green curve. This is the trade history.

I have no doubt that there are people out there making this claim...just as there are people out there who think unicorns exist. It does nothing to refute this claim because only a small kooky minority are making it.<p>The REAL point is that ""Most experts in the field believe it is true, therefore it is reasonable to go with that belief until we have a reason to think otherwise"".<p>You are confusing ""scientific proofs"" with how one should act when faced with making a decision. We cannot say that ""AGW is true because So-and-so says it is""....that is an argument from authority. However, as citizens trying to make decisions about how to run our society, it's reasonable to go along with the consensus of (expert) scientists in matters of science.<p>This brings up another point, it's not a matter of what scientists as a whole statistically believe... it's a function of what field the scientists are in, their experience, and their expertise. The assertion is that most experts in the field of climate science (and related fields) agree with AGW and that it is a somewhat concerning issue (though the issue of to what degree is in debate), and there is a sort of rippling of agreement throughout semi-related fields which is worthy of consideration but less heavily weighted.<p>Where your point is fatally flawed is you are making a false comparison. You cannot compare Christianity which is a vague cultural identity with what they have found via research.<p>I think if you talk to the majority of scientists who are Christian, you will find that they are Christian mostly only in culture. They are not fundamentalists. They believe there is something called God, and there was this guy a few thousand years ago with some good ideas and maybe he was connected with this God....but if you press them I think you will find they are generally flexible and admit they don't know for sure and are just going on belief.<p>What you are talking about is an <i>UNSCIENTIFIC BELIEF</i> that they have arrived at completely arbitrarily. It's the same as if you found out that the majority of scientists prefer chocolate ice cream....that doesn't lend some validity to chocolate...it's just an interesting statistic.<p>AGW on the other hand <i></i>IS<i></i> a scientific idea. It's something that was arrived at THROUGH A SCIENTIFIC PROCESS. The fact that most experts agree with it (if it's true) lends it credibility because they either:<p>a) were able to reproduce the results with their process
b) studied the process of others and found them reasonable<p>You can argue that the science is flawed, or argue that most experts DON'T agree with it...but it's perfectly reasonable and correct to think that something is more likely to be true if the experts say it is in proportion with the amount of consensus...when you are talking about science . The logical fallacy is only if you claim it is DEFINITELY true, particularly based on a small amount of consensus.<p>The opinion of scientists absolutely has weight....in matters of science. Christianity as a whole is entirely outside the realm of science, and therefore the fact that many scientists happen to be Christian is irrelevant.<p>Furthermore, if you do a survey of all the scientists in the world, I think you may find that the majority of them are not Christian.

The trouble is that the mixins are static.  At the moment you mixin a module, the modified object/prototype is what it is.  You can modify the original mixin object, but that won't impact any of the objects/prototypes having already integrated the mixin.<p>Now I'm thinking about this and perhaps this is a stretch, but couldn't this be solved by making an adjustment to how javascript supports prototypal inheritance?  What if instead of constructors supporting a single ""prototype"" property, they supported a ""prototypes"" property (an array)?  I mean when you think of the nuts and bolts behind inheritance it's nothing but a deterministic means of resolving a method invocation.  You call a method on an object and the interpreter uses an algorithm to locate the method, starting on the object itself and drilling down the prototype chain.  If instead, the prototype chain involved an array of prototypes, we'd still have a deterministic means of locating the desired method.  We'd also have a better form of multiple inheritance.<p>Additionally, mixins could be pushed onto the prototypes array.  (You could even insert a mixin just above some other mixin if you wanted.)  It wouldn't be necessary to copy methods.  Modifications to the original mixin would actually take effect across the board.  This alone is a good thing, but there's even more good news, at least when it comes to the apps I've worked on.<p>I find that my entities have a need for dynamic typing.  For example a Person could also be a Father or an Employee.  DCI is gaining traction.  Using DCI you make your classes simple and inject role-specific functionality into objects just as the functionality is needed.  This is all good and I like the approach for the most part.  What I don't like is that in a long-lived user session I have the need not only to mixin role-specific functionality, but to unmix it.  When I say ""long-lived"" think in terms of a single-page web apps where you may be managing state for quite some time--up until the point that the user leaves the app.  One thing I don't like in a language (including Javascript and Ruby) is that although it's easy to extend objects, unextending is not easy.  Developers have attempted to solve this in Ruby by writing libraries (like Mixology), but I'm not happy that a custom library is necessary for something that I feel the language should support natively.  If you had a prototypes array, as I'm suggesting, you simply drop the mixin reference and you're done.  It's a simple mental model and no fancy library is necessary.<p>Couldn't this be written in a backwards compatible way?  Just because we have a prototypes property doesn't mean that we couldn't also have a virtual prototype property that gets/sets the first item in the array.<p>I was considering making an official proposal about this to ECMAScript, but I thought I should put this in front of the Javascript community to see what holes might be in my proposal.  Does this sound workable?  Do any disadvantages outweigh the advantages?",1341927534

Even if they eventually use the files for another purpose, those are two separate requirements (the first to communicate with other processes and the second to journal that communication). Replacing file based communication with something like a simple TCP based message protocol would likely yield great dividends.

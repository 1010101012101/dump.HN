What they tell you: Buy a greener car</i><p>The perfect examples of this myth are the Toyota Prius and alike, it amazes me how wrong they are.<p>I've read that the production of these cars is more wasteful than the usual (because of the batteries that have to be shipped), that the global shelf life of the car is poor, that it is difficult to recycle them and finally that the fuel consumption is not extraordinary low (equivalent to a small car).<p>Yet they receive an enourmous media coverage because they seem to be the response to a greener car.",1259326795

In fact, I'd argue that the Moose metaprotocol is substantially more powerful than the one available in python - though if there's a python library that provides the same sort of level of capabilities, I'd love to hear about it - maybe we can steal some good ideas from them :)",1259326667

So's HTTP::Engine.<p>And with the PSGI standard and Plack reference implementation, the lighter weight stuff is starting to standardise too - my new toy, Web::Simple, leverages Plack to provide Catalyst::Engine-like functionality but in a very lightweight manner and very shareable between different frameworks with different philosophies.<p>I remember showing DBIx::Class to Simon Willison at a LugRadio Live - he looked at some of the complex queries chained resultsets and easily build and his jaw dropped. We were going to try and get round to me helping him fix Django's ORM to have more of the capabilities of DBIx::Class in return for him helping me build a django-admin-interface-like piece of code for Catalyst but we never quite got to it, sadly. Happily, our respective communities seem to have already done similar things without us :)",1259326577

963810,comment,963577,963577,0,0,rick_2047,,,"I like to think of the topic from a different angle. According to me a technology as handy as an printed book can never die. As an analogy I would like to present the case of radio v/s TV.<p>Before the advent of TV radio was the main mode of entertainment. But as TV started to take over the market everyone speculated that radio may never be able to catch up and will die for sure.But radio still exists. Why?Because it now survives in very small but concentrated markets like car radios.(I know mp3players are now more dominant in developed countries like the US,but for developing countries and other less privileged people radio is still a luxury in cars and taxis).New radio stations are being created and now in my city i have 6 options where when six to seven years back there was just 2.<p>In the same way, paper books may never lose there market and may never die. There would be always an increasing number of book stores springing up at every corner.Devices like kindle have surely revolutionized the eBook market,but we must except that what kindle did was make a market of its own rather than attracting attention from other markets.<p>Also due to the mindless DRM's and copyright issues with ebooks, you may never have the pleasure of having the feeling that you OWN the book. You cannot lend it to a friend, you cannot store it somewhere other than your kindle,you cannot redeem half its value at a second hand book shop. These special privileges are only offered by a good old printed paper book which you can carry in your hand.",1259326288

Ruby 1.9 and Python 3 have both run into adoptions problems because of compatibility issues, whereas the Perl5 language v10 (and soon v12) don't/won't have nearly the same adoption problems because we focus on enabling libraries to improve the language rather than on baking in additional features.<p>Not that there aren't advantages to shoving things into the compiler and VM directly, but I'm not sure I believe that in this case they outweigh the advantages of keeping things as libraries.",1259326099

This ceases to be helpful when you're not only adding punctuation or alternate scripts but special symbols or letterforms as well (okay, so the Russian ""i"" could be on the ""I"" key for phonetic typing or on the ""N"" key for what it looks like, but where would you put ""left arrow"" or ""double dagger"" or even ""logical not""?).<p>I think the same holds true for the compose key, tho: it's easy to remember ""o + / = ø"" (or was it ""o + -"" or even ""o + |""? With the kind of redundancy in the compose table, all three probably work), but how do you deal with conceptually similar glyphs like ""a with dot below"" and ""a with dot above""?

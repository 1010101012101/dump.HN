Even XML+XSLT versus XHTML might have different semantical implications, so the best assumption is that no two ways of representing a given content can ever be identical.<p>Well, <i>that's a Good Thing.</i> If I'm requesting a given resource and I signal preference for a PDF-encoded response, that implies on some level that I want a print-formatted, print media version of that resource, whereas its HTML counterpart can be hypertext and multimedia.<p>What you as a server are committing to is that both servings are representations of the same given resource, but without prejudice of putting each format to its best use.<p>This is also beautiful in that if the HTML stack proves to be a bad idea in the long run, rather than being deprecated, it can fall into disuse slowly alongside the slow rise of its successor(s). In fact, there's absolutely zilch stopping us from having more than one canonical format — any server-side MVC (or MVCish) architecture can probably handle that off the box!<p>EDIT: to be sure, the question of how expensive it is to develop for two different representation formats is a whole other story.",1317092352

But let me add to the discussion that more often than not, it is an order of magnitude (or more!) easier to look at someone else's solution and understand it than it is to arrive at the solution in the first place. I am even willing to believe that, perhaps if the problem were very well-defined, you might be able to solve it in an afternoon. But if you were in his situation, how long would it have taken you to characterize the problem so that you could solve it?

As someone else pointed out, in the past, even the relatively <i>recent</i> past, the vast bulk of humanity was directly involved in growing food. Now those jobs are gone. So what happened?<p>Other jobs, including types of jobs never imagined before.<p>Capital producers, such as programmers, those still involved in mining, etc. aren't going to want to just sit there and hoard their programs, iron, food, etc., and they will find some way to spend it on other goods and services that the robots can't do, or that humans simply won't accept robots doing. The future has a lot more artists in it, I think.<p>The unemployed will make money when you decide that there is something in your life that you want, be it art, services, or even just robot wrangling itself, and you want that good or service enough that somebody is willing to provide it for you for a price you'll take. Not you in the abstract, <i>you</i>. If you get desperate enough you may well be willing to pay them to learn how to do this thing you want, or at least subsidize their way through it. Things may change a lot, but the fundamental forces of economics don't break down until this set dwindles to zero (presumably because you can just instantiate an AI to do what you want), at which point all bets are off anyhow, and the poor will probably still be mind-blowingly rich by our standards at that point.<p>Now, that's not to say everything's hunky dory. There is some legitimate concern about the rate of job elimination exceeding the rate at which people can retrain into other skills. I'm pointing this out though to make the observation that we have over a hundred years of historical answer to your question, a continuous cycle of destruction of industry after industry, yet barring a fundamentally finance-and-stupid-policy crisis that we happen to be in now, we're still looking at single-digit unemployment with people working ~40 hours a week, numbers that are very stable across decades (at least in comparison to the horrible pictures people paint of this scenario). It's interesting to discuss what's <i>different</i> about this innovation surge, but ""Who will buy the Model Ts?"" ceased to be an interesting question decades ago.<p>(And personally, while the topic may be in the air, it hasn't happened yet. I don't think this unemployment spike has anything to do with robotics. The business cycle suffices to explain it. I don't expect the next wave of roboticization to really start impacting the job market for a good 5 or 10 years minimum. There's still a lot of pieces to put together.)",1317090849

I own a reusable water bottle company. All of my warehousing and shipping needs are done by a fulfillment house (which does the same thing for other small businesses). Our shipping and warehousing needs are shared. And most of my marketing can be done through MailChimp,Twitter etc.<p>I don't need to hire any workers either.<p>Worse still, let's say my competition has 5-10 employees. All things being equal, I can undercut them ruthlessly if I wanted to because I have lower overhead.<p>I think an easy way to keep tabs on all of this is to simply look at unemployment. If it stays around 10% for another few years, it seems like we have a STRUCTURAL unemployment problem on our hands. And one of the causes is surely automation.",1317089453

The problem is always public perception and liability. Medicine is as much about instilling people with confidence as it is with actually healing them. Some (most?) people would shy away from the idea of an automated diagnosis. Also, a bad diagnosis (even if it was caused by improper input into the expert system) introduces a quagmire of liability.",1317089335

Every day some kid is risking a fine for selling lemonade by breaking any number of permit and health code laws.  They do it anyway.<p>I suppose a lesson could be learned, start a movie studio that shows how to build a lemonade company.  Most kids would not get off the ground.<p>Most would simply complain to their parents who would in turn email The Consumerist causing the media to get the kids their lemonade stand.<p>I probably would have broken the rules and got the truck without the permit.  Maybe it would have blown it for me, and I would have been forcibly removed and never sold a single shoe.

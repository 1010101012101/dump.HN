After all, this very stupid thing, one's own whim, gentlemen, may in fact be the most advantageous thing on earth for people like me, especially in certain cases. In particular, it may be more advantageous than any other advantage, even in a case where it causes obvious harm and contradicts the most sensible conclusions of reason about advantage - because in any case it preserves for us what's most important and precious, that is, our personality and our individuality.\n...\nI believe this, I vouch for it, because, after all, the whole of man's work seems to consist only in proving to himself constantly that he's a man and not an organ stop! Even if he has to lose his own skin, he'll prove it, even if he has to become a troglodyte, he'll prove it.""",1264888726

All the syntax around types confuses my simple brain.<p>F# on the other hand felt a lot like a functional python for .Net. Complete with the syntactic whitespace and a light weight class syntax that feels very similar to pythons classes (completely with explicit self).<p>Both worth exploring IMO.

Your statement is technically true, but I disagree with the subtext.<p>Factually, workers with no marketable skills don't have them because they didn't acquire them as students. Factually, it's not Walmart's fault that its workers have no marketable skills and thus no alternatives. However, those two facts don't imply that it is just (or societally optimal) for us to do nothing about the problem.<p>Workers are being paid below market wages because their switching costs are too high. This is both inefficient (market prices are efficient prices) and unfair (the very poorest workers are being paid even less <i>because</i> they are poor). Therefore, it is right and good that we should pass laws to help improve that situation and return wages to their market values.<p>Now, there's the separate question of what the best laws to do that actually are. It seems unlikely to me that allowing employees to sue for something as nebulous as ""infringement on free speech"" is a good idea. But I hope I've made a strong case for why <i>some</i> legal intervention in this situation is reasonable.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/4h/when_truth_isnt_enough/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/4h/when_truth_isnt_enough/</a>",1264885633

My gripe is with freenode policy, which is asinine, not with the particular person I spoke to, who was merely being useless and patronizing.<p>The reason I got pissed wasn't because of the nick loss, which I find mildly annoying, but because channel ops got blown away, causing me to have to deal with this bullshit instead of just giving ops to someone else.<p>Yes I can be blunt. If you value the superficial affectation of politeness over the essential point of what someone is saying, you can shove it. I don't appreciate people saying that I'm this way because of asperger's, it just causes other people to whine that they're being oppressed because they can't criticize me. The whole line of argument is stupid. People are free to criticize me for not being polite, and I'm free to respond that they're being petty and superficial.<p>The whole 'it's free so you can't complain' argument is bullshit. There are plenty of free things which are of negative value to society because they suck up or distract resources which could be working on a much better alternative. I've provided lots of support for free stuff myself, both via employees and directly, and never have I claimed that a problem won't be fixed because the person airing a legitimate gripe hasn't gone through arbitrary bureaucratic processes, or that the person complaining should implement it themselves because they're a programmer, or refused to acknowledge that some pain a user experienced through no fault of their own really was unfortunate. And I always prioritize up users who matter and problems which need immediate fixing. That's the way you run things if you actually care about providing a valuable service.",1264885537

1089259,comment,1088699,1089205,0,0,amix,,,"There are two reasons why I picked JavaScript. First, V8+node.js is an amazing runtime system. One should remember that V8 is implemented by a highly skilled Google team that's led by Lars Bak - who was the lead architect for Java's HotSpot VM (the current VM that's used in Java...) So first choice, performance. node.js is also very small in size, so I figured out I could patch if anything wasn't working.<p>The second reason to pick JavaScript is that it's already geared towards event based programming, because of following things:<p><pre><code>   events in browsers and\n   closures are a natural part of the language, e.g.\n   document.addEventListener(""click"", function()...\n</code></pre>\nEvent based programming is needed to implement highly scaleable non-blocking servers. So JavaScript is a really good match...<p>And really, JavaScript is a great language and it can emulate almost any paradigm that you may like. node.js also introduces a module system which makes it much easier to manage code. JavaScript isn't perfect and there's tons of bad code written for it, but it's possible to create beautiful code in JavaScript :-)",1264885475

Really, is there any fundamental reason we should expect Google to remain perpetually on top of the search engine business?<p>I think the difference in quality between Google and Bing search results is negligible; at this point it's just a matter of mindshare as to whether people, on average, go to www.google.com or to www.bing.com when they want to look something up.  There's no vendor lock-in propping up Google, to the extent that there is behind the Windows or iTunes monopolies.

Functional programming, immutable data structures, great built in data structure support, macros, excellent concurrency support, a good standard library and direct access to Java libraries all make Clojure a beautifully powerful and easy language to work in. The clojure community is also very friendly and growing every day, so if you need it, getting suppor is not hard.<p>I do still like Python, but theres so much more nice things out there. Besides clojure, I'm playing with Yeti and hope to give F# a look soon too. Maybe some day I'll have some time to play with Haskell also; its been on my todo list for a long time.",1264885260

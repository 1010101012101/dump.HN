10436198,comment,10432463,10435886,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Personally, I don&#x27;t agree with your assumption.  It is totally fine for 2 people to have the same globally recognized name because the people who need to differentiate between them will spontaneously invent a system to do so.<p>In Japan nobody has middle names and family names in some areas are very common.  For example, where I live Suzuki is ridiculously popular.  At the school I taught at, 10 of the 80 teachers had the last name Suzuki and 3 of them had the same first name.  It was absolutely not a problem.<p>These teachers responded to <i>many</i> names.  Sometimes their first name, sometimes their last name, sometimes their home room class number and their last name.  The name that was used depended on context.  There was absolutely no reason to have a globally unique name for them.  Their family called them something, their friends called them something else, their colleagues called them something else, their students called them something else.<p>The important part is that the person interacting with someone has a distinguishable name for that person.  However, they do not need to share that name.  I don&#x27;t need to know that my colleague&#x27;s wife calls him Pooky, while I call him Tarou, while his students call him Mr. Suzuki (if they can even remember his name at all -- quite a lot of the students will just call him &quot;teacher&quot;).<p>This is also true of computer systems, from my experience.  You need a globally identifiable identity (like an SSH key), but you do <i>not</i> need a globally identifiable name.  The people who interact with the identity can choose any name they wish.  The name is not important.<p>Sometimes you have 2 or more people who know the same person and want to reference them.  As long as they have a globally recognizable identity, then it&#x27;s fine.  So if person A says &quot;Pooky (who controls ssh key 1234) is a very kind person&quot;, I can easily identify the person that they are talking about (or verify that I don&#x27;t know that person).  My determination of whether the person is kind or not will depend on how much I trust person A.<p>As the other poster mentioned, in virtually every case, web of trust, and nick names are exactly what you want.  The only time you need a globally identifiable name is if you are interacting with someone that you have never had any dealings with before (and none of your acquaintances have had any dealings with before) and you want to be assured that they are who they say they are.  But in this case there is still a gap -- you will need some kind of authority to vouch for their identity (like a government with a passport number or something like that).  A block chain will not do that for you.<p>Like the other poster, I can see no utility in this.  It&#x27;s technologically interesting, but there are better ways to disambiguate names.<p>Edit: Reading further in the comments, key revocation is an interesting problem which I hadn&#x27;t considered.  I can see a use for a ledger in that case.",1445561618
10436197,comment,10420539,10421058,0,0,GeorgeOu,,,"If you read the FAQ on eevblog, 100 KHz frequency ultrasound will lose 90% of its energy at 2 meter range or just over 6 feet.  That energy goes to heating the air that the sound travels through.<p>Then you have to contend with any orientation offset.  If the receiver is off by 90 degrees or more, there is zero energy received.  If your hand blocks half the surface area, that&#x27;s another 50% power loss.<p>If you boost the power above 140 dB safety limit, you can burn your hands or cause other problems.  At 140 dB at 2 meters, the theoretical best case with 100% efficiency transmitter and receiver will deliver 0.85 watts.  You obviously lose even more than that.<p><a href=""http://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/the-ubeam-faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/the-ubeam-faq/</a>",1445561602

For most VMs, those numbers are just pointers to structs it has allocated, so they can&#x27;t really &quot;live&quot; outside the VM. Nock just goes a bit further and says &quot;but if you give those struct-pointers persistent wire-representable identifiers ala CapnProto, you can serialize the whole internal-VM-state graph in a portable way—and then <i>that</i> can serve as the VM&#x27;s ISA.&quot;",1445561370

And for very good reason: because at the hands of people who don&#x27;t understand the dangers, it can be absolutely devastatingly lethal.<p>Take for instance the irradiation accident in Goiania (Brazil) where a radioactive source was removed from a trashed teletherapy machine by people scavenging for scrap.<p>This is from the IAEA report on the case:<p><i>After the source capsule was ruptured, the remnants of the source assembly were sold for scrap to a junkyard owner. He noticed that the source material glowed blue in the dark. Several persons were fascinated by this and over a period of days friends and relatives came and saw the phenomenon.

10436094,comment,10435074,10435917,0,0,davmre,,,"The point is that supervised training on large networks requires millions or billions of examples. In RL, that means potentially billions of execution trajectories, which can be really expensive if you&#x27;re executing on an actual, physical robot. And even then, supervised classification objectives are more informative than just a scalar reward: when a supervised system makes a wrong prediction you don&#x27;t just tell it &quot;sorry, that&#x27;s wrong&quot;, you also tell it what the right prediction would have been. That extra information is really valuable for learning.<p>In the black-box RL setting, you only see whether what you did was right or wrong, not what the right thing <i>would</i> have been to do. And unlikely a classification system where the output space is relatively small (ImageNet has 1000 classes), an RL agent is searching over an exponentially large space of possible trajectories. Which means that without some additional source of supervision you can spend a <i>long</i> time wandering in the wilderness with no idea of whether what you&#x27;re doing is reasonable or how to get any reward at all. And when you do get some reward, you have no idea which of the possibly hundreds or thousands of actions you took  deserves the credit.<p>A lot of recent RL research is about finding additional sources of supervision, such as training an agent to mimic the policy of an &quot;expert&quot; (e.g., a search algorithm that runs in a simulator to find an optimal solution, but which requires too much computation to actually apply directly at test time, as in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00702"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00702</a>), or coming up with proxy objectives like &quot;empowerment&quot; or &quot;curiosity&quot; (which you can define in terms of information theoretic quantities, such as mutual information between the agents&#x27; action sequence and future state, e.g. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08731"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08731</a>) to supplement the actual reward signal. This latter path, the notion of &quot;intrinsic reward&quot; that paulsutter alluded to, is in some sense the merger of RL with unsupervised learning, and a lot of the power is that you&#x27;re getting new reward signals <i>constantly</i>, not just when you finally manage to achieve some arbitrarily difficult task.",1445559886

Backprop just moves a lot more variables to a desired outcome, that is what LeCun is saying.

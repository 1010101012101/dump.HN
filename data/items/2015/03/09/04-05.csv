9169190,comment,9166706,9168390,0,0,m_mueller,,,"French society may in that aspect be a little closer to Japanese, to which I&#x27;m more familiar with: Some cultures put more value on harmony than on justice. This was at first not very easy for me to understand, coming from a German speaking culture, and I believe it may be even more difficult for Americans (who according to my impression seem to be even more demanding of &#x27;justice&#x27;), but it is what it is.<p>Just as an example, in case of a car accident in Japan, the blame (and thus damages/fines) is almost always shared (even in completely obvious situation where we would see one party 100% at fault), especially so when a passenger other than the driver was hurt - just so the driver in question wouldn&#x27;t loose his face completely. &#x27;Being there&#x27; at the wrong moment is enough to be partially blamed for what happened. There&#x27;s something to this you know - if an incident is potent enough to destroy someone&#x27;s social status, it often might be better for society to let it slip, rather than to go the &#x27;nuclear option&#x27; (i.e. the American way) of throwing people in jail, make them loose their job, possibly their family, or even take away their children. With marriages it&#x27;s similar - husbands/wives often rather don&#x27;t want to know rather than to risk a family&#x27;s stability.",1425877101

As a single man though, the Bay area makes a lot of sense for me as a result, since the pay still outpaces the cost of living for me.  Being tired of wintry weather was also a huge factor in me migrating out west.<p>There is a chance I might migrate south to the Austin area in the future, or back east to the NY or DC area eventually - I do miss the strong ties I have to the east coast from having lived there for most of my life, but Austin sounds attractive as a tech hub and due to more sane housing costs.",1425877096

9169173,comment,9167008,9167008,0,0,FrankenPC,,,"One time, I was helping a friend of mine work on Javascript (js) skills.  We cycled through all the basic sorting algorithms to practice js best practices and help with understanding computation complexity issues.<p>On one sorting algorithm, Can&#x27;t remember which one ATM, involved recursion.  It was pretty simple.  My friend couldn&#x27;t understand the nature of the problem because he didn&#x27;t have a instinctual comprehension of recursion.  I threw together a Visio of the process and walked him through the blocks one by one.  He still couldn&#x27;t wrap his mind around it.  He started to berate himself and I could tell he was giving up on his dream.  I told him to keep trying.  To keep spending the time on places like HackerRank.  He did.<p>8 months later, he landed a job as a js full stack programmer.  Not a senior level position, but a damn good one.  I&#x27;d seen his work before his interview and it was good.  He had a command of all the major frameworks and he was observing all major js design patterns while avoiding idiotic anti-patterns.  His code was clean and easy to read.<p>IMO Pointing out that someone APPEARS to code like a loser is a petty playground tactic of someone who has a serious ego issue.  Taking someone by the hand and helping them through the hurdles so they can become a better programmer is the solution.  I can&#x27;t imagine how my friend would have reacted if he had read this petty article while he was trying so hard to become a decent programmer.  He may very well have given up.  That&#x27;s not acceptable.<p>There are only people who give up and people who refuse to concede defeat.  Ranting on a website about bad programmers is giving up.",1425876828

Calling the police or going to HR is the &quot;lethal&quot; option, meaning that, in all likelihood, there is going to be a big problem, and somebody is going to suffer.<p>I think the following scenario should be easy to understand (if not familiar) for most people:\nA person is walking down the street, when somebody approaches them and tells them to surrender their wallet.\nWhat would most people recommend in this situation?\n&quot;Let them take your wallet, there&#x27;s no point in risking your life&quot;?\nWhat if the person being mugged revealed they were carrying a weapon capable of deadly force?\nWould you recommend that they use it to defend themselves?<p>Would your recommendation change if the threatening person in question had a position of default trust (e.g. a police officer), or a member of a powerful gang?<p>Now imagine a person in a scenario where, instead of just walking down the street, they are approached _in their office_ by somebody they trust, and instead of being asked for their wallet, they are asked for something incredibly more traumatic and unrecoverable, under the threat of complete financial destruction or possibly even physical harm.<p>I would never want to find out which way I would decide, in any of these situations.

9169117,comment,9167781,9168541,0,0,lambda,,,"I would also like to point out, for the benefit of anyone else here (just replying to you to clarify your point), that the Logical Rules referred to are commonly referred to as the Tromp-Taylor Rules, after John Tromp (the submitter and parent commenter) and Bill Taylor, who wrote them up as a simplified version of the New Zealand rules; and that these, in turn, are in the branch of Chinese-style, or area-scoring rules (counting the sum of stones on the board and territory surrounded for score), to contrast with Japanese and Korean style, or territory-scoring rules (counting the sum of territory surrounded minus captured stones for the score).<p>The reason that rulesets in the Chinese style branch are more amenable to mathematical analysis are that you can play the game until you have an unambiguous result about the life or death of a group, and thus these rulesets usually involve simply resuming the game and playing it out if there is any dispute about whether a group is alive or dead (or, for the logical rules, don&#x27;t involve resumption at all, you just play it out and score it as is after two passes, with all empty points that reach two colors being counted for no one; since in area scoring games, ending the game before that point is mainly a convention for human players who don&#x27;t feel the need to play all the way to the point of killing obviously dead groups).<p>Under Japanese style rules, playing within your territory to kill a disputed group may reduce your own score, so rather than just playing it out to the end, there are an elaborate set of conventions for determining the life or death of particular shapes. This elaborate set of conventions is much more difficult to represent mathematically.<p>The American Go Association rules of Go have an interesting hack to allow you to use Japanese-style territory scoring, but wind up with the same result as Chinese-style area scoring would give you, by having you actually give your opponent a stone as a capture when you pass, plus making the game-ending passes be two or three passes such that each player has the same number of turns. This preserves the benefit of area scoring, that any dispute on life or death can be resolved by resuming the game and playing it out until the situation is completely unambiguous, while still allowing the somewhat easier method of counting that territory scoring provides (filling in liberties with captured stones, and then just counting the remaining territory, and thus having to actually count to a lower number).<p>The Tromp-Taylor rules do make some adjustments for the sake of making it even more amenable to analysis that most other rulesets do not, such as allowing suicide. This doesn&#x27;t actually affect the strategy in very many games, as it&#x27;s very rare to encounter a situation in which a suicidal move would be the best choice, but it tends to make analysis a bit simpler as there is one fewer constraint to worry about. I feel like allowing suicide is more elegant, but it is only allowed in a few rulesets.<p>It is unfortunate that for such a simple game, there is no one agreed upon worldwide rule set. There are a couple of different parameters that you can tweak in a ruleset that give you a game that is very similar, but different enough in a few corner cases to make them different games; territory vs. area scoring (and with territory, the large number of conventions on life and death you need to make it work), simple ko vs. situational superko vs. positional superko, suicide vs. no suicide, counting points in seki, and komi (number of extra points for the second player to make up for the first-move advantage).",1425876086

The characters are exaggerated, but honestly to the point that they (intentionally) aren&#x27;t realistic.<p>Anita Sarkeesian&#x27;s graduate thesis and the subject of more than one of her videos is an extensive criticism of how &quot;strong female characters&quot; in fiction reinforce binary gender stereotypes by requiring that their definition of strength conform to masculine ideals of it rather than feminine alternative models (strong female characters have to be &quot;badass&quot;.) I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s wrong, but the argument has been leveraged often enough that it&#x27;s made even me wonder what would be good enough to satisfy some people. Please note that you can trip this criticism simply by adding additional female characters, which is exactly what some people here are complaining about.

SF is famous for its collaboration between businesses.<p>* I don&#x27;t even understand the idea of wanting to turn off work on a daily basis.

9168998,comment,9165462,9168738,0,0,super-serial,,,"Even backbone isn&#x27;t worth the added complexity IMO.<p>All these frameworks make you write more code than needed... and because people started to feel it wasn&#x27;t worth it, their latest pitch focuses on speed. They say the &quot;virtual DOM&quot; is the future, and if you&#x27;re not diffing your state to re-render the DOM you&#x27;re not a serious developer.<p>I still don&#x27;t see the benefit.  I&#x27;ve written 15k lines of javascript code in some apps.  My components have state and I re-render as needed, and as long as you separate code between components it&#x27;s fine.<p>How many times have you been using a js app and thought &quot;wow this DOM is slow?&quot;  You don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s either 0.1 sec or 0.2 sec to re-render the whole component/widget.  99.9% of the time a website is slow because the server requests take too long. Every once in a while you&#x27;ll see some crazy CSS3 animations that make things unresponsive.<p>The people who go on about having a virtual DOM run benchmarks on thousands of elements... I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;m never rendering thousands of elements at a time.  Ajax/pagination works fine for extra data.  I did write a very simple template system and event management system... but I&#x27;d rather do that than add the complexity of a framework.  Dealing with a framework to make things work in &quot;the X way&quot; is wasting everyone&#x27;s time.  And then the next Angular or whatever comes along... and everyone wastes more time learning the latest version.  This has turned into a rant... but I just want to say I&#x27;m happy as a coder who avoids frameworks at all costs.  At the same time I try to use as many libraries as possible.  Libraries save time, frameworks waste time.",1425874143

8613465,comment,8612860,8613206,0,0,graycat,,,"> How does one take a &quot;Fourier analysis&quot; of a bridge?<p>Give the bridge an &#x27;impulse.  Then it&#x27;s Fourier transform is\nhas all frequencies.  Then see what the bridge does:  Get out\nthe transfer function of the bridge.  It might have\na peak -- then don&#x27;t march the troops at that frequency.\nOr the output motion of the bridge is the inverse\nFourier transform of the Fourier transform of the\ninput to the bridge from the soldiers times the\ntransfer function of the bridge.  If the signal from\nthe soldiers puts too much power at a frequency that is\nhigh in the transfer function, then that is a &quot;resonate\nfrequency&quot; and the bridge is threatened.<p>For the violin, yes, the human ear does a lot of\nFourier analysis with the little hairs inside that\ncoiled up thing, whatever it is called, but for the\nviolin I was considering the beats when bow\ntwo adjacent strings together.  So, bow the\nA string at 440 Hz together with the E string\nat about (3/2)440 Hz, and listen to the third\nharmonic of the A string and the second harmonic\nof the E string -- they should be the same\nfrequency.  If their frequencies differ by\nx Hz, then the sound will have amplitude modulations,\n<i>beats</i>, of x per second.  That&#x27;s how a violinist\ntunes the instrument.<p>The Fourier part?  The\nsound from the A string is roughly periodic but\nnot a sine wave.  Similarly for the sound from the\nE string.  Do Fourier analysis, that is, Fourier\nseries on each of the two periodic signals.\nTake the third term from the Fourier series of\nthe A string and the second term from the Fourier\nseries for the E string, and listen to the beats.\nWhile the signals from each string are periodic,\nthey are not sine waves, but the terms from the\nFourier analysis are sine waves which is partly\nwhy the beats are so easy to hear.  So, in effect,\nare using, say, the E string to find the Fourier coefficient\nof the third harmonic of the A string.<p>The A and E strings are separated in frequency by\nan <i>interval</i> of a <i>perfect fifth</i> which is 7\nsemi-tones or, from a piano, about 2^(7/12)\nwhich is close to 3/2.  Well, that&#x27;s the story for\na perfect fifth.  But there is also a perfect\nfourth, 5 semi-tones, a major third, 4 semi-tones,\nand a minor third, 3 semi-tones, a perfect 6th,\n9 semi-tones, and, of course, an octave, 12\nsemi-tones.  In <i>perfect</i> tuning, each of these\nintervals has, for the two notes, overtones\nwith the same frequency (for two small whole numbers,\none of them times the frequency of the lower\nnote is the same as the other times the frequency\nof the higher note)\nso that can <i>tune</i> the\ninterval by listening to beats.  Of course, the\neasiest one to hear is the octave.<p>So, when\nusing two strings this way, really are doing a\nFourier analysis using one string to take the\nHilbert space inner product of the two signals\nand using a sine wave from one of the overtones\nand its inner product with the other signal\nto <i>scan</i> that signal for beats and, thus,\nwhere the overtones are and, thus, really \ndoing what Fourier analysis does, a projection via\nHilbert space inner products onto orthogonal \naxes (sine waves at the overtone frequencies, that is,\nat frequencies that are whole number multiples, whole\nnumbers again, of the frequency of the original\nperiodic signal).  So, adjust one of the two\nstrings and in effect scan the sound from the other\nstring for it&#x27;s overtones -- that&#x27;s essentially\nFourier analysis.  I will resist writing out all\nthe math, but, really, a lot of Fourier theory is\nfairly intuitive stuff where a lot of the main ideas\ncan be done with just pictures.<p>Or, yes, it would\nbe a little simpler to play just, say, the A string\nand have an audio oscillator that puts out a sine\nwave and, then, slowly sweep the frequency of the\noscillator sine wave and listen for beats with the\nsound of the A string -- that&#x27;s essentially just \nFourier series analysis of the periodic signal of the\nA string.  But if don&#x27;t have an audio oscillator handy,\nand use another string, say, the D or E string,\nand its overtones, each of which is a sine wave,\nand adjust the frequency of the D or E string and,\nthus, <i>sweep</i> a selected (listen carefully!)\novertone of the D or E string past selected overtones\nof the A string and do much the same as with the\naudio oscillator.<p>Gee, I knew there was some Fourier\ntheory in there somewhere!",1416113883

8613463,comment,8612730,8613022,0,0,jdietrich,,,"The real problem isn&#x27;t drug repurposing, but off-label promotion. If you want to take a drug through FDA approval for another set of indications, that&#x27;s fine and dandy. What isn&#x27;t cool is actively promoting the use of a drug without market approval - having reps drop subtle hints, funding third-party publication, paying doctors to speak at conferences about their off-label prescribing and so on.<p>Eli Lilly, Pfizer and AstraZeneca have collectively paid out more than $2.5bn in settlements over the off-label promotion of atypical antipsychotics. The drugs that they unlawfully promoted are now being used widely for the treatment of a variety of conditions for which there is little evidence of efficacy. Lilly were marketing Zyprexa for the treatment of dementia, in spite of having extensive unpublished research showing that it was ineffective.<p>Atypical antipsychotics are being used by far too many psychiatrists as a catch-all where other lines of treatment have failed - OCD, autism, PTSD, ADHD, anorexia, substance abuse, you name it. In most cases the evidence of efficacy is slim-to-none. That&#x27;s not medicine, it&#x27;s quackery. Frankly, I&#x27;d be happier if they were prescribing placebo; Nobody has ever died from the side effects of sugar pills.",1416113833

8613440,comment,8611922,8612546,0,0,dockimbel,,,"Same reason for Red aswell as for Rebol. There are many more primitive/literals like that, tuple! [1] for example is used to represent RGB colors (255.0.255), ipv4 addresses (192.168.0.1) or even version numbers (2.7.8). Time/Date [2][3] also are basic datatypes with proper literal form.<p>From Rebol console (these types not yet all implemented in Red):<p><pre><code>  >> red + blue\n  == 255.0.255\n  >> 192.168.100.123 and 255.0.0.0\n  == 192.0.0.0\n  >> yesterday: now/date - 24:00\n  == 15-Nov-2014\n  >> in-one-year: now + 365\n  == 16-Nov-2015\n  >> yesterday < in-one-year\n  == true\n</code></pre>\nRebol provides around 55 datatypes, with a good part of them having a specific literal form. The standard library is actually built-in the language, through this rich set of datatypes (each datatype overloads the basic language functions and operators). You don&#x27;t need to &quot;import&quot; any of it, it&#x27;s right there, but almost transparent to the users.

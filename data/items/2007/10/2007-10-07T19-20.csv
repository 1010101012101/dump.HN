Lisp is nice, but the implementations have issues. I'm mostly satisfied with SBCL at the moment, but I keep writing utility functions to get around the warts in the language. Languages seem to be an instance of the ""all X sucks - some just sucks less"" pattern.<p>4. I think providing explicit support for state machines would be a Good Thing even without the visualizer.<p>5. Something that lets you look at an expression as you step through evaluation and substitution would be useful. Macroexpand does this at compile-time, but I want something similar at runtime for parts of the expression that aren't macros. I suspect something like this exists, but I haven't seen it yet. Slime's disassemble takes the name of a function and displays the corresponding assembly code in a buffer.<p>I agree that it's not practical at this point to try to completely prove the correctness of programs; I think it's more useful to prove specific aspects of a program as an alternative or supplement to tests. It's also useful to make assumptions about things you can't prove in the mathematical sense but can rely on when writing or running a program.<p>What's next? I've been meaning to download and try out Qi, a language that builds on top of Common Lisp and has a type system based on sequent calculus. It looks like Qi allows users to start with fairly general types and narrow them down as the program develops.<p>I didn't enjoy OCaml when I spent a couple days trying to learn it. The restrictions of the type system were frustrating, though I did get the feeling that it's a much better way to keep people from breaking stuff in a ""software engineering"" situation than using Blub.",1191786484

That being said you talk as if things were static, ""fb apps are far from indispensable"" uhh that doesn't mean other better apps won't come... your issue there isn't really with the platform is with current app developers I guess, or is there something particularly wrong that will prevent interesting software from being written for this platform? <p>""Platform is the Bubble 2.0 buzz word""<p>first there is no bubble2.0 at least not even close to the extent of the last bubble, bad investments/ventures will fail as they always have and will, there are no crazy IPOs with ridiculous valuations. there won't be massive lay-offs. <p>""It's also yet another way in which MySpace is superior. They have always allowed you to stick JavaScript in your profile page, so it has always had a platform.""<p>uhhm the platform is more than sticking widgets on your profile, if you're writing an opinion piece on this maybe read up? I mean just that you don't come out sounding like a complete idiot.

As per your learnings people are machine so you can easily replace one malfunctioning part by another.<p>I am not involved in any startup but like to do my job with creative energy and scripted quite a few time saver solutions for my group. Until now all my manager were thoughtful enough to allow me but this new guy thinks that he can replace any person with any person without looking at the unique attributes of each of the person. He wants me to do the work others can do without looking at what i can do and others cannot...
I am sorry but you are sounding like my manager so get a job in big company. Startup make you respect your talent and looks like you do not want to do that...

64496,story,,,3,6,Jd,"Ask YC: Any good online resources on the Linux kernel?",,"I've recently made the transition from the Windows world to full-time Linux usage and am finding myself increasingly curious as to how it all works. Are there any good primers on Linux kernel design or historical accounts of how the OS came together? I'm primarily looking for things that are available in digital format, as at the moment I'm not able to acquire additional paper products.",1191785034

That's perhaps the first relatively hard thing to learn in C, it may take you a little while to grok it.<p>And I get the impression that K&R doesn't teach it well; I myself read the Lions notes to ""get it"" (_Lions' Commentary on Unix_, ISBN 1573980137, a critical 1977 book with the UNIX Version 6 source code and excellent commentary).  Now of course there are many more good expositions on this and the other harder parts of C.

64494,comment,64413,64413,0,0,aston,,,"For what it's worth, this is not the right way to implement such a site. The author notes that there's a collision problem, but pretends it's not a big deal when it actually is. What's the chaining (re-hashing) strategy, and do you really want to pay that cost every time anyone clicks either of the colliding links?<p>The better implementation is the one that seems stupid, namely start at 1 and increment your link number every time you get a new one. Encode it in something like base 36 (numbers plus lowercase letters), and you're basically done. This method also guarantees that your links are no longer than they need to be.",1191784294

The focus there was lower volume, higher quality regulated by a financial marketplace rather than community features. Not really even in the same class of product.<p>It was shut down not because of competition but instead because it wasn't worth anything to Google, really, at least relative to their search product.",1191783997

64491,comment,63978,64051,0,0,yters,,,"One way Facebook can be very useful is by providing trust and accountability for distributed/social applications.  <p>For example, if everyone did email through facebook, then you could restrict incoming email to within 6 degrees of your friends.  If spam starts being sent because of one of your friends, you have incentive to cut off that friendship before you get cut off from your social network.  <p>Like that article awhile back talked about, Facebook is another step in automating the way we build trust.  And trust is the bedrock of a cohesive and effective society.",1191783649

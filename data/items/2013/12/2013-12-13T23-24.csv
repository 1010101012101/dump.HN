I do think that your comment strongly implies agreement with the non-sarcasm-quote-using parent comment, but hey, maybe that&#x27;s really just my reading of it. Your edit also confusingly says that you don&#x27;t think the &quot;lousy&quot; languages are really any easier than the static languages you prefer, despite your second paragraph seeming to say the opposite. So maybe I&#x27;ll just bow out of trying to interpret what you think :)<p>I&#x27;ll freely admit that it peeves me to no end when people make value judgments based on what programming languages people do and don&#x27;t like and use, on <i>both</i> sides of the static/dynamic divide, so maybe I do have that chip on my shoulder.",1386979196

And God forbid you have even minor packet (like 0.0000001%) loss in the network between your webserver and database server. Your 99% tail latency will sprint for the 10s mark.<p>And as the DBA&#x27;s here said : most databases are in the GB range, with a few in the tens or hundreds. SQLite will beat the crap out of any other solution at those sizes.<p>People don&#x27;t realize how much tail latency affects maximum QPS. Once you calculate how one affects the other you see that tail latency is the enemy of performance in webservers. A webserver that can generate 100% of responses in 1ms can serve 1 million qps (ie. can saturate a 10Gbps link). At 99% at 1ms and 1% at 10ms (the very minimum to execute a single query against a database that isn&#x27;t local to your machine),  you&#x27;re left with 900k. More typical database figures would be 20ms average and 600ms for the 1%, which will leave you with 30k QPS. In this example using a database cost you 97% of your original performance.<p>That 97% figure is perfectly normal. So if you want decent performance, using a database server (in the serving path) is just not in the cards at all.",1386978984

The best optimizations I&#x27;ve ever done in website servers is to introduce local caching where reasonable, ignoring updates. User records, item records, comments, sessions, all would be cached locally. You wouldn&#x27;t believe the speedup.<p>Having your data on a different server as your website introduces, effectively, a much higher minimum latency. It adds 5-6 ms to every single page load. If I were writing the site that would be a factor 5 drop at least. This is extra time that your webserver has to keep state for a request, and so effectively can mean a drop of a factor 5 or more.<p>The DBA said then that this would undermine consistency. And, of course, he&#x27;s right. However for most things websites don&#x27;t actually need consistency (plus the web request response model makes it impossible, as the data client-side is not included in transactions). The prices at checkout, sure, there you want consistency. Everything else ... do you really care if it takes 1-2 minutes for your webfarm to be entirely in sync ? (and if it&#x27;s important enough you can implement &quot;clear this cache item now&quot; requests too, which I did for user records after a complaint)<p>Databases are so ridiculously slow it&#x27;s not funny. If your data fits in 64-bit address space, an mmap&#x27;ed serialized data structure will blow it&#x27;s socks off, and for everything that doesn&#x27;t absolutely require synced data it&#x27;s fast. If your critical data is small enough, keeping it in memory with a background thread getting signaled to dump it to disk after every update may also work.<p>I wrote a network-as-a-service infrastructure for an isp once (something to do with data on cell phones), where each machine would happily do 1Gbit of web traffic, directed by it&#x27;s 5Gb database (meaning it would need to look up user account balance, potentially update it, for every request), consistently and quickly (99.9% of requests was < 1 ms).

I had two startups before and they both failed. I have learned so much from each one of them. I know about the ins and outs of startup marketing, project management, and sales. Entrepreneurs never quit, so I want to take the lessons learned and try again. I have tried posting on HN before with little luck. I started my first business at the age of 15 in high school and my family is full of entrepreneurs so entrepreneurship runs deep in my blood.\nI am willing to work my ass off including weeknights, weekends, or whatever it takes. Looking for someone who wants to start their own business just as badly as I do.<p>I am currently in NYC, and I have bunch of savings saved up that I can survive for at least three years without a job.<p>Here is a little about me:\n-I graduated from one of the top undergraduate business schools in America (currently in the top five of the Business Week’s top undergraduate business school ranking list)<p>-I have worked at Google and Salesforce in San Francisco for about a year and a half prior to moving to NYC. I am a 24 year old male.<p>-I am really good at people&#x27;s skills, presenting, networking, and business development. I have high emotional intelligence and am pretty easy to get along with.<p>-I can SELL! I am also well-read.<p>-I am a go-getter, and do not need to be told to do things. I literally can do everything and am a fast learner.<p>I am looking for someone who is extremely dedicated, hungry, and willing work their asses off to make a successful startup. If you are action-oriented, hacker-type, and are looking for a non-technical co-founder that fits the description above then please contact me at matt.gerboth@gmail.com.

There&#x27;s an awful cognitive dissonance between what the population perceives and what results are, mainly because the poor are misinformed and cannot judge (the government will always blame an external force: the opposition, capitalism, USA, whatever), and the middle-class prefers to ignore reality (for them, it&#x27;s better to have an incompetent, but left-wing government than to forfeit their ideologies).",1386976374

The .asc is a signature for the release.<p>A signature is made from the release engineer&#x27;s key pair and the release artifact. gpg can take the .asc and the .zip as inputs and tell you what pub key made the signature (and it reports it as a short fingerprint). If you&#x27;ve imported a trusted key into gpg, it will tell you that it&#x27;s a verified and trusted key, and tell you who it was.<p>My pub key for ASF signing is available here:<p><a href=\"http://people.apache.org/~thoward/F1AADDE6.asc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://people.apache.org/~thoward/F1AADDE6.asc</a><p>If you pull all these files together and verify them, this should be your result:<p>$ curl -sSL <a href=\"http://people.apache.org/\\~thoward/F1AADDE6.asc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://people.apache.org/\\~thoward/F1AADDE6.asc</a> | gpg --import\ngpg: key F1AADDE6: public key &quot;Troy Howard (CODE SIGNING KEY) <thoward@apache.org>&quot; imported\ngpg: Total number processed: 1\ngpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)<p>$ gpg --verify ~/Downloads/Apache-Lucene.Net-2.9.2-incubating.src.zip.asc ~/Downloads/Apache-Lucene.Net-2.9.2-incubating.src.zip\ngpg: Signature made Fri Feb 25 09:33:40 2011 PST using RSA key ID F1AADDE6\ngpg: Good signature from &quot;Troy Howard (CODE SIGNING KEY) <thoward@apache.org>&quot;\ngpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!\ngpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.\nPrimary key fingerprint: 062B 4DAF 06F8 61CD 2E71  E40B 8EAA A8A8 F1AA DDE6<p>Anything else, and you should not use the release.<p>A good package and release system, like Docker Index/Registry should build these verifications in automatically.

It&#x27;s certainly pretty hard for our parent/child combination, I couldn&#x27;t imagine spending even a full day alone with them, and my wife is always exhausted when I have to go on a business trip. I&#x27;m optimistic that it&#x27;ll get better when they stop being toddlers though :)",1386975768

Even more so given that some words in many languages have a gender leaning... is it &quot;le user&quot; or &quot;la user&quot;?  Given that, one would probably be more appropriate.",1386975732

This at least would eliminate the embarrassment of being &quot;less real&quot; than the above layer.",1386975644

Once you get over the barrier of being in a network it seems like you get to work on some really interesting and challenging problems. I don&#x27;t understand why there is such an inherent bias to being multidimensional.",1386975635

32625,comment,32602,32602,0,0,tt,,,"Another pointer is to have insatiable curiosity in everything that you do instead of thinking of work as just a job. Be your own judge of your quality of work instead of relying on others and you will be pleasantly surprised.

An attempt to set up the system such that the easiest thing to do is also the highest value thing to do, without being too draconian?<p>In the end, carrots work better than sticks, I quite agree.",1183655576

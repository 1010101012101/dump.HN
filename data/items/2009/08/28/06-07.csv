So you didn't group kids at all, and older kids helped younger kids.<p>I especially like the part about the older kids helping the younger kids since it can help reinforce a topic.

790884,comment,790800,790800,0,0,olefoo,,,"Two points:<p>1. This is not a problem with Google's Customer Service, it is a problem with their vendor relations. When Google publishes ads on your site, you are selling that space to them. Google is your customer and isn't obligated to tell you a damn thing except that they don't want to buy from you anymore.<p>2. There is a market opportunity here for an ad network that is willing to find good sites dropped from Google Adsense by erroneous algorithms. And that can appeal to the news herd (all the traffic driven by reddit, hn, slashot, digg, etc.) with either brand advertising or targeted ads designed to appeal to surfers from those sources.<p>The thing is, from a strictly mathematical point of view Google may be perfectly correct, the 100 visitors a day coming to the site while looking for robotics news may have been more valuable to their advertisers than 10,000 stimulus hungry nerds that don't buy shit. And while it's hard on the site in question Google is playing for the percentages, not sheer volume.",1251441676

It's the easiest, automated solution to combat lots of problems like click-fraud, advertiser complaints, etc.  If they don't disable the account, they have to constantly handle <i>this</i> type of account, the high traffic, potentially high click-thru, but low conversion attracting account.<p>The other solution requires making a lot of changes to a lot of accounts.  The advertisers' ad positioning, the rates for the ads, which affect other adsense sites, etc.   In that case, Google runs the risk of angering a lot of customers, both advertisers, and real estate providers.<p>The other solution: ban the account -- angers only one real estate provider.",1251441396

Though they don't publicize it, they are practically an AI company. Unfortunately if the Google Corporation complaints division succeeds in this automation, the first words spoken by a strong AI probably won't be along the lines of ""What hath God wrought"", or ""I am become the angel of death"", but more like ""Share and Enjoy"".<p><i>""Share and Enjoy"" is the company motto of the hugely successful Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent years.<p>The motto stands — or rather stood — in three mile high illuminated letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadrax. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young complaints executives — now deceased.<p>The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read ""Go stick your head in a pig"", and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.</i> <a href=""http://flag.blackened.net/dinsdale/dna/book2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flag.blackened.net/dinsdale/dna/book2.html</a><p>Calvin and Jobs <a href=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3191/2723090810_6501c93ae2_o.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3191/2723090810_6501c93ae2_o....</a>",1251440880

790861,comment,790575,790802,0,0,blackguardx,,,"Resonant energy transfer has been known for a very long time. Any electrical system that has inductance or capacitance (which means all electrical systems) will have a resonance point. This resonance point is the like the resonance point of a mass spring system or like resonance of a pendulum in a grandfather clock. If you drive a system at its resonance point, you will maximize the energy transfer into the system. That is all that is going on. If both the send and receive coils resonate at the same frequency, maximum power transfer can occur. There is no magic. This isn't a technology.<p>Also, the coils do indeed have to be parallel to each other. Fields gradients are function as vectors in space and the receive coil must be positioned to ""capture"" as many field lines as possible emitted from the transmitter.",1251440125

I was pondering between purchasing the $25 PDF edition of Programming Ruby 1.9 (<a href=""http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9</a>) and this one.  I was surprised to see this price, which had apparently been adjusted a few hours prior.  I purchased it because it was written by the author of Ruby, was twice as affordable, and because the preview on scribd contained a lot more pages for me to help base my decision on.  It also covers Ruby 1.8, as well.<p>The quality of the PDF is immaculate.  Only the cover pages are scanned in: the rest of it is glorious vector text and graphics, allowing one to zoom in and out as much as they could want, similar to what I like to do when reading web sites.  It's also searchable, which regular books are not.<p>The fact that it's a digital work forces one to scan the book, skipping past parts one recognizes, putting in practice those they don't.<p>Finally, a digital edition enables one to easily copy-paste those parts of code he or she doesn't feel like typing out themselves.",1251439905

In this case, it may be aimed at connecting flights, or at initial departing flights.<p>For others, having the information is useful, even if it doesn't mean rebooking.  For example, I have traveled a lot for business and we joke about the value of the power outlets at the airports - another 20 minutes with power for my laptop is a big value in the airport. :-)<p>Lastly, we humans have to be careful about our bias toward making ambiguous numerical claims and extrapolating out from our limited experiences.  The flights you have taken in your part of the world is a small sample size to generalize from.

For more gradual breaking changes, the developers have been good at adding lints to rustc so you&#x27;re told how to fix your code via compile-time warnings. Vec migration and crate attribute syntax are two recent examples of this.",1398517196

The street-facing shops of the KWC, all the way around it, were dominated by unlicensed Chinese dentists trying to hawk their services in Hong Kong against the law.

So, unfortunately (from my perspective), the arguments were couched in the broadcasters&#x27; semantics from the start.<p>What&#x27;s so weird about the case is we&#x27;re talking about Aereo providing, but not paying for, what&#x27;s already freely available.

For me, its rather a deterrent for friends and family members, making them ask me before they can use my computer. Maybe this attitude comes from the old days where the linux screensavers were so brittle that they would crash by looking at them the wrong way.<p>Nevertheless, this bug is a big WTF and shows that it is not a good architectural choice to have the lock screen as just another X app. It would make more sense to have it in the kernel, and have one app that is allowed to supply a gui. If that app crashes, it is just restarted, or it falls back to text mode. If the user authenticates, the lock screen goes away and the main X server / wayland / whatever is reconnected to the hardware.<p>I think Windows uses alternate desktops/sessions (I&#x27;m not sure what the technical term is) for the lockscreen, as well as for the Ctrl+Alt+Del screen, so there is a similar protection at the kernel level. However, if winlogon.exe or anything related to the logon screen crashes, you have hardly any chance of recovering.",1398514804

We have decided that you can&#x27;t be placed into involuntary servitude without criminal charges being brought against you, due process, etc...

There are certainly some problems with the current implementation, but bankruptcy was never intended to protect you from criminal acts, fraud or otherwise.<p>But personal bankruptcy is essential, as you imply, because most of us feel that indentured servitude is enough like slavery that we don&#x27;t want it in our society.",1398514290

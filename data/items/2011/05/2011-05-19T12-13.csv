2563751,comment,2559734,2559734,13,0,JunkDNA,,,"I'd like to offer a slightly different perspective on this. As someone who is a hybrid hacker/biologist, I welcome something like TermKit. I have invested a good chunk of time learning unix commands and the shell because lots of scientific applications require it. Furthermore, as a data wrangler, the unix tools are a necessity for quickly processing and pumping files around. I <i>require</i> unix to efficiently do my job. I often think, ""Gosh, what do all these other people <i>do</i> when they need to do X?"" where ""X"" is some ugly task that I can hack some grep and sed commands together to accomplish. I don't think most programmers understand the sheer number of exceptionally well-educated, genuinely smart people who spend huge chunks of their day doing menial ""copy/paste"" in Excel (because it's the only real tool they can use) when they should be designing bridges, curing diseases, analyzing data, etc...<p>If you're a unix sysadmin or a full-time hacker, you can justify the cost in time and effort of learning and memorizing all this stuff. In fact, you'd be foolish not to. But there are a lot of people who don't spend all day in a terminal. Nevertheless, they frequently <i>need</i> the unix terminal to get something done. A tool like TermKit could be a huge boost for those people allowing them to bootstrap their knowledge without having to dive into the deep end all at once.<p>There are legions of people out there who are smart enough to learn some bits of unix if only the learning curve wasn't a sheer brick wall.  If you need evidence that man pages and ""-h"" don't cut it, start typing common unix commands into google (xargs, tar, grep, etc...) and you'll almost always find one of the top suggestions is ""command_name examples"" or something like that. Why is that? My grandma isn't trying to use ""xargs"" I assure you. Someone with enough knowledge of the unix command prompt to know they need xargs reads a man page and they <i>still</i> don't know how the hell to use the command properly. That's a usability problem and there are modern ways to help with it (as is demonstrated by all the things IDE's do to help programmers all the time).<p>I'm really excited to see where this goes. There are all sorts of possibilities it opens up.",1305809980

2563747,comment,2561354,2563625,3,0,hasenj,,,"You're talking about different things. Awareness, Will, machine-like-decision-making.<p>Decision-making can be completely robotic. Will, or Free Will, and whether or not it's compatible with materialism, is another controversial problem. Awareness, is what you feel subjectively. I can build a robot that senses colors, and when it sees the color red, it screams ""OMG! RED!!!"". This robot however has no awareness what so ever. What you described is exactly the kind of thing that might happen with robots, but it has no relationship to the awareness/consciousness aspect of the problem.<p>> Here are some other examples of ""mysterious phenomena"" which it took a while to explain (...)<p>This is a weak argument, and really it's irrelevant to the mind-body problem. All things you described are physical states to begin with.<p>A more approximation of the mind-body problem might be some one saying something like this: fire is not the same sort of thing that water is. I can hold water in my hand, but can I hold fire in my hand? I can store water for later use; can I store fire for later use? Now this sort of argument could be right or wrong, but it seems like a plausible thing to say. It's not saying fire is some kind of a super-natural miracle.<p>I think we both agree that we don't know what awareness is; the difference is I'm saying I know what it's not: and I know it will not arise from a computer simulating a brain.<p>Overall I think consciousness is an interesting topic that's worth reading about. I don't mind someone being a materialist, but it doesn't seem like you appreciate the difficulty of the problem.<p>It's theoretically possible that one day we'll know more about awareness, and I don't know what that knowledge would be like, but I'm pretty sure it's not something that arises from running some sort of a computer program. And I can also say with about 85% certainty that it's not reducible to any of the physics we know about today.<p>It's also theoretically possible that we'll never know what awareness is. It might seem outrageous and somewhat a ""forbidden"" idea to speak, but it's a possibility. Either due to time restraints (the universe dying before we get there) or conceptual restraints (as in, maybe our minds are just not smart enough to figure it out). Unlike most other things in nature, I don't know of anyone who even came up with a hypothesis of what awareness might be. For instance, atoms where theoretically discussed long before science proved they existed, and many different models were advanced to explain and account for planetary motions (many of them were wrong, but you get the idea). But awareness, doesn't even have any model that might account for it; not even a wrong one. That's a strong indication that it might be something outside our comprehension; not much unlike the nature of space and time.",1305809792

You scrape along with no success and no money for a long time before it grows into something that can support you.

And as you mentioned, it doesn't fit a lot of people's definition of a ""business"".<p>That's fine.  Just remember that there is in fact another definition.  Revenue Generation is still part of it, but it's not the end goal.  Generating enough revenue to live comfortably on while minimizing the amount of time and effort you need to expend is the ultimate goal for a lot of us.  In that context, a company that brings in $20k/month and runs on autopilot is the highest form of success.

They took on their first employee and maybe had to again cut their salaries to afford it?
YC worries me that it convinces everyone to start a company rather than go to school, work for another company as an employee or follow a different dream. We're being sold someone else's dream of ""starting a company is the best thing in the world to do"".
The talent pool is being severely diluted just like too many expansion teams in a sports league. The end result? Less success for everyone.
I admire their persistence, but I wonder if Octopart is in a market where they can build a company that can hire and pay the employees or maybe even generate a larger lump of cash. I may not get the new model yet, but I still think that revenue generation is the goal of a company.

In reality, your life is not either an open book or a closed one, and you can choose how much personal information of what type you share with whom. The problems usually start, IMHO, when others are allowed to make that choice for you.<p>This can be direct, as with all the modern tracking technologies and personal information that businesses try to collect about you even if they don't really need it, but it can also be more subtle, for example where social networking sites can build up a profile on you based on information implied by your relationships, or where information from sources you might expect to be independent is aggregated and available for data mining by a single entity. It also cuts both ways, if you wanted to share certain things but for some reason were prevented from doing so, leaving others with incomplete or out-of-date information even though you were willing to share that kind of data with them.<p>I think the more serious problem here is that this is a Pandora's box problem. Once your life is out in the open, there is no way to put it back, but the consequences are not always immediately obvious.<p>Perhaps as a society we should grow up and learn not to evaluate people based on isolated data or out-of-context incidents that we find out about their past, but as any politician, insurance company or judge can tell you, that's not going to happen any time soon. It's probably a generational shift if it's even possible at all.<p>In the meantime, an entire generation are growing up sharing their lives on Facebook and Twitter and being physically tracked via their mobile devices and travel smartcards and logging every purchase/refund they ever made with credit/debit/loyalty cards. It's only a matter of time before ""bad candidates"" don't even get their CVs read because the employer's automated background checks picked up a black flag, ""bad customers"" (who expect the product/service they paid for and complain if they don't get it) see their consumer rights eroded by the power of the database, ""bad clients"" can't get useful or even legally required insurance because their profile fits a high risk group, and so on.

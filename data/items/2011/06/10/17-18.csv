2641789,comment,2607052,2607052,1,0,hoffstein,,,"New York, NY - Multibillion-dollar hedge fund looking for an exceptional programmer to join our core development team.<p>We build the tools and engines used by the fund's portfolio managers, traders, quantitative analysts, and back office team to develop trading strategies, analyze risk, and manage day-to-day trading operations across a wide range of markets. We are language-agnostic, but would like someone who knows at least one general-purpose language (C++, C#, Java, etc.) and one get-it-done scripting language (Python, PERL, etc.) well enough to create rock-solid, production-quality systems.<p>Strong financial mathematics skills are obviously a plus, but those can be taught (and we are happy to teach you). What cannot be taught, and what we seek most, is an intense passion for programming and the desire to tackle the types of difficult problems found in the financial domain. If this sounds interesting to you, please email hropportunity1@gmail.com (sorry for the throwaway address, but for various reasons we cannot publish our actual contact info). Or, if you prefer, contact me directly through my HN profile.",1307728794

2641779,comment,2641426,2641426,8,0,scythe,,,"The way I see it, learning to be uncomfortable is beside the point; it's about finding the positives, not ignoring the negatives. If you learn to be uncomfortable, you become complacent, and don't do things to improve your life in real, tangible ways, like, say, negotiating a better salary.<p>If there's a problem you need to solve with a method like this, that's great, but I would hesitate to recommend that people regularly incorporate unpleasant things into their daily life for the sole sake of them being unpleasant. That ultimately leaves you with less understanding of not only how to lead a pleasant life but also of how to improve the lives of the people around you, this latter goal being the core of entrepreneurship. E.g. if you try to use nothing but `cat` to edit files, you will never design a better text editor. If you walk to work, you won't be able to contribute to advances in vehicle technology.<p>Ultimately I think our goal as humans is to reduce that sort of thing, not to increase it; otherwise we might as well revert to nomadic tribalism. To quote Edward Abbey:<p><i>One final paragraph of advice: do not burn yourselves out. Be as I am  a reluctant enthusiast... a part-time crusader, a half-hearted fanatic. Save the other half of yourselves and your lives for pleasure and adventure. It is not enough to fight for the land; it is even more important to enjoy it. While you can. While its still here. So get out there and hunt and fish and mess around with your friends, ramble out yonder and explore the forests, climb the mountains, bag the peaks, run the rivers, breathe deep of that yet sweet and lucid air, sit quietly for a while and contemplate the precious stillness, the lovely, mysterious, and awesome space. Enjoy yourselves, keep your brain in your head and your head firmly attached to the body, the body active and alive, and I promise you this much; I promise you this one sweet victory over our enemies, over those desk-bound men and women with their hearts in a safe deposit box, and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators. I promise you this; You will outlive the bastards.</i>",1307728623
2641778,comment,2641398,2641398,3,0,hamiltonchan,,,"Thanks for the compliments, rdl!  When it comes to designer codes, I believe that function trumps form.  There is definitely no point to designing a code if it cannot be scanned quickly and easily.  The code in the TechCrunch article should definitely scan easily across any QR reader on any smartphone.  That said, it is nearly impossible for us to test every reader on every phone.  Assuming a designer code can be scanned easily (which is a requirement on every designer code we create), the benefits of branding the code are tremendous.  Scanthrough rates shoot up when you use a designer code, and they definitely have the ability to become the talk of the town.  We will put up examples of designer codes on <a href=""http://www.paperlinks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paperlinks.com</a> in the very near future so you can decide for yourselves!",1307728617

They can go back to their investors for a bridge loan, or issue warrants, or try another private (probably down) round.<p>Two very interesting things have come out of Groupon's history so far, the first is that they turned down a $6B buyout (which seemed amazing to me at the time) and then they did a fund raise where most of the stock was insiders selling.<p>That particular combination makes me wonder if the buyout was rejected because the way money would have been shared around was stipulated by previous term agreements, and some of the investors didn't want that, so they did the series D or what ever it was which allowed them to funnel money to specific investors, so that now if they take a hair cut on valuation those investors are 'protected.'<p>So the fact that they are bleeding cash will force some sort of financial transaction to occur (buyout, bridge loan, chapter 11 bankruptcy), if they are having a hard time getting the offering fully subscribed they may be shopping the company around, and if they are doing that they are in a much weaker position than they were before.",1307728424

You'll realize this if you try to hop on to one of the IRC networks -- there are a million different little channels each representing its own fiefdom.

Some recent examples include LulzSec and Goatse Security. There are also the people who run the websites and the IRC channels and who make the DDoS tools and similar skiddie stuff; these guys are by any measure the <i>real</i> ""leaders"" of the operation, but they prefer to sit on the sidelines and don't usually get their hands dirty.

In the North, where I live, the economy is large and lively, people are rich, and they work hard. There is, of course, a palpable difference between the way of life here and in Northern Europe, but it isn't as big as I think most people expect (the food and coffee are better). It feels very similar to a typical European capitalist economy.<p>Of course, that's only half of the story. Southern Italy, despite it's idyllic landscapes and hedonism, has some serious economic, demographic, and social problems and they don't deny it. I have never felt they wore it as a badge of honor to signify some inner nobility, as you posit. Most Italians I've talked to want to solve these problems and believe they're actively working to do it. They don't feel the fact that they enjoy a good quality of life impedes their ability to develop a strong economy - they think the best of both worlds is possible.",1307726844

It is getting more and more difficult for Eurozone countries to finance sovereign debt. Its population is aging. Pension costs are rising. Productivity, according to Mario Draghi, is stagnant, in part because employment in Italy is structured weirdly, with large numbers of closely-held firms with a two-tiered system of full-time full-benefit workers hired through nepotism and armies of temp workers. Civil cases in Italy average more than 1,000 days. The country has wild gaps in educational outcomes between different regions.<p>I don't think you can write all this off as an ""Anglo-Saxon conspiracy"". These are ideas that can be described with simple numbers, aren't they?<p> <i>Articles about Italy have long attributed this to Italy's family culture, in which people cohabitate with their extended families long into adulthood, but it seems just as likely that this is a result of laws making it hard to fire people.</i>",1307726834

A development environment is typically much less secure than the live environment, and for good reason. The development environment must be accessible to developers, typically both on-site and remote. All developers have access to test databases for the purpose of testing their changes. There are often many more software packages in a development environment, and development servers have a higher probability of running vulnerable services. Live environments typically have much better logging and auditing.<p>Every company should have a program that can be run to sanitize the live database for use in testing.

I think his main contribution was in combining a wide range of ideas into a compelling worldview.<p>- His ideas about the fragility of scientific knowledge, its dubious epistemology, e.g. the importance of the anomalous.<p>- His ideas about the unsustainability of consumer civilization<p>- His ideas about the epistemological implications of DMT and psilocybin, and drugs in general<p>- His ideas about using drugs to discover new ideas (IIRC in this talk: <a href=""http://www.matrixmasters.net/salon/?p=328"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matrixmasters.net/salon/?p=328</a>)<p>- His ideas about the singularity and teleology<p>- His idea about drugs have shaped human culture over the millennia, and possibly also human evolution.<p>- His focus on the big questions like who are we, why are we here, where are we going, etc.<p>- The way he was able to find elements of validity in paradigms that have long been outright discarded such as shamanism, alchemy, various spiritual traditions, etc.<p>It's unclear what impact McKenna will ultimately have because it's hard to predict how people will react to living in a world that's running out of material resources, a world with 100x as many academic studies as there are now, a world with unimaginable technology and suffering, etc. But based on how things seem to be going, it's really hard to see how science can remain indefinitely divorced from philosophy and the humanities, which is sort of the essence of his worldview.<p>It's difficult to see him ever getting credit for much because his ideas would definitely need to be cleaned up by others and reformulated before having a wider impact, and so it's unclear how he would be credited since most aren't really his ideas to begin with.

It wasn't designed for that.  I think that's exactly what Apple is doing here with iCloud.  They are taking something that was designed for local access (native applications) and are attempting to shoehorn cloud into it.<p>iCloud will never work as seamlessly as a web application. Consumers will not be fooled.  You can't go to your friends house and edit a document stored in iCloud.  You can't pull up a Word document at the library. But you can access your Facebook account.  You can open a spreadsheet in Office Web Apps.<p>Apple <i>is</i> selling iCloud because they have to.  Customer perception is not on their side on this one, finally. It's a very tough sell.  1) You have to commit to the complete Apple ecosystem. 2) You have to give up the ability to access your files anywhere.  My guess is that most common consumers will not fully embrace iCloud.  I don't expect it to be the same type of runaway success that iTunes and iPhone were.  Rather it is more likely to be a moderate success: something people use when it's convenient but not something people change their habits to accommodate.",1307725221

There is an enormous amount of magic going on behind the scene to put a car on an actual road on the map.<p>When I&#x27;m driving on the highway with spotty coverage, I very often hear &quot;Turn Left in 50 m&quot; when the magic fails and the GPS (mobile phone running TomTom in this case) now thinks I teleported on a side road.<p>Similarly, you could get yourself lost for hours if you follow your GPS blindly in a small European city. Actually, you would probably get into a traffic accident before that.<p>When I see people comment on GPS, I can only imagine that in 20 years, you will see headline like &quot;Family had to be rescued after their autonomous car failed to exit Walmart Parking lot for 5 hours and ran out of gas.

We live in Uruguay, and at least for us, it makes way more sense to have an Android tablet than an Apple tablet, moastly because a lot more things are paid on the iPad, and most developers target Android first in my country because it has 90% market share. So YMMV. We also have Android phones. I think the user experience is good enough on both OS, and I&#x27;ll probably buy Android for my next tablet (I got really frustrated by the iPad&#x27;s limitations). Apple does have the everything-integrated experience if you buy only Apple (iMac, iPhone and iPad), but only affluent people can afford that, and I wouldn&#x27;t want it even if I could afford it (which I can&#x27;t).",1393847524

That&#x27;s bad.<p>If this is 64-bit PHP, any realistic bitcoin amount multiplied by 100000000 would still be within the integer range (2^63 - 1) and can be passed around without any loss of precision ...<p>... unless $info[&#x27;balance&#x27;] has anything below the decimal point. As soon as you&#x27;re dealing with fractional bitcoins, the amount will be converted to a float before it is multiplied by 100000000 and then back to an integer. So even in 64-bit PHP, the code can&#x27;t avoid passing bitcoins around as a floating point number.<p>Realistically it is extremely unlikely in 64-bit PHP that the loss of precision caused by this single line of code (and the subsequent casting back into float) will ever round up to a satoshi. The (int)round() just makes sure that you get an integer rather than a double-precision float, because PHP loves to turn your values into other types behind your back. Nonetheless, if the program keeps casting numbers between int and float all over the place, eventually it may begin to lose a satoshi here and there. At the scale of Mt Gox, the errors will definitely add up. That&#x27;s why you should never touch a float with a ten foot pole if you&#x27;re dealing with money.<p>The correct way to handle monetary amounts in PHP is to use the bcmath extension, which enables arbitrary precision.",1393847131

Inside the bars there are beats, often 2 or 3 per bar, most often 4. Then each beat is divided in 2 or 3 parts.<p>Then you can play it slower or faster, that&#x27;s the <i>tempo</i>.<p>Notice that it&#x27;s just about the <i>rythm</i> of a song. The actual notes you can place on it wherever you feel. Of course you want them to match some subdivision for them to feel &quot;right&quot; but often intentionally shifted for expressivity (swing).<p>Some <i>standard</i> signatures are:<p>4/4 - Bars of 4 beats naturally divided in two (most songs)<p>3/4 - Bars of 3 beats naturally divided in two (waltz)<p>2/4 - Bars of 2 beats naturally divided in two (march)<p>12/8 - Bars of 4 beats naturally divided in three (used in blues)<p>The /4 or /8 difference is moot. It&#x27;s the duration of the beat, but you can compensate it with tempo.",1393845032

Similar to how Windows was a revolution in desktop computing (whether you liked it or not).<p>&quot;Gaining widespread adoption&quot; was never an area Apple was very good at. They were always good at creating consumer-focused PCs. The initial line of MacBooks and iMacs are good examples of this — minuscule user base compared to Windows, but built to Apple&#x27;s standards of what a computer should be. Their initial aim for the iPhone was to capture 1% of the market, they hardly expected the success they received.",1393844997

You pass the parameters to PDO separately from the query for sanitation.\nWe can all see why this is bad:<p><pre><code>     if (isset($_GET[&#x27;limit&#x27;])) {\n         $limit = (int)$_GET[&#x27;limit&#x27;];\n         if ($limit < 1) $limit = 1;\n         if ($limit > 10000) $limit = 10000;\n      }\n $req = &#x27;SELECT * FROM `Money_Bitcoin_Node` WHERE `Status` = \\&#x27;up\\&#x27; AND `Last_Checked` > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 6 HOUR) AND `Version` >= 31500 AND (`Last_Down` IS NULL OR `Last_Down` < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 WEEK)) AND `First_Seen` < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 WEEK) ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT &#x27;.$limit;</code></pre>",1393844835

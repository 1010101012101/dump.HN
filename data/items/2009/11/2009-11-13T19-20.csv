940646,comment,940188,940527,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I don't think this is such a terrible thing, although clearly this adversarial approach to testing ideas isn't for you, or everyone. Enrico Fermi used to challenge grad students with similar questions, the famous example being 'how many piano tuners in Chicago?'.<p>I don't think it's a stupid or impossible question, but one that seeks to establish how you go about estimating tricky things and thus identifying fruitful territory for more rigorous research. Let's walk through it, with the awareness that we're trying to refine our techniques of estimation rather than caring about the actual number of barbers.<p>'Barber' implies haircuts for men. This is good, because the number of hairstylists that cater to women depends on fashion, which is hard to quantify. On the other hand, hair cutting is more related to hair growth. There's about 3/4 of a million people in San Francisco. Roughly half of them are men, so we have 375,000 potential customers. Most men wear their hair short, off the ears. Of course some wear their hair long and have it cut very infrequently, while others like it much shorter, eg with a buzz cut and have it cut more often...but some of them may cut their own hair, since a buzz-cut isn't too challenging. I'm going to assume the number of hippies cancels out the number of close-cutters because San Francisco has a bit of a hippy reputation. So much for hairstyling.<p>OK, so I've postulated 375,000 men who average out to a 'regular hairstyle'. And I've postulated that a regular hairstyle means not having your ears covered, ie the old 'short back and sides'. While it's growing, you could comb it out of the way or let it cover the tops of your ears, but  once it gets half-way down then you're either growing it out or it's time to visit the barber. How much hair is that? My ears are about 2 inches high, but I have small ears. 3 inches sounds pretty big though...I'll guess the average is 2.5 inches, so half of that is 1.25 inches. That's already pretty fluffy though...let's round it down to 1 inch. OK, so 375,000 men get a haircut whenever their hair has grown by more than an inch.<p>How long does that take? Hair grows at about 4 inches a year, so let's say 3 months. Which gives us 1.5 million male  haircuts a year for the whole city. (we could have started calling the population p and the rate of hair growth g[h] and so on, but why bother, it's a chain of reasoning we're concerned with here). A haircut takes, what, 20 minutes? it could be faster, then again some want a more difficult style. So let's guess that there's half a million hours of actual hair cutting (including the bit with the sheet and the sweeping up etc) going on in a year in SF.<p>Now we're getting somewhere. How much does a barber work? I'd say 45 hours a week. Some barbershops open early for the business crowd, but then they're closed on Saturdays. Monday-Saturday seems reasonable, as does 2 weeks' holiday. So one barber could spend a maximum of 2500 hours per year cutting hair. Only, that seems a bit high. Sometimes you wait in line, but I don't usually think of barbers as busy flat-out most of the time. 30 hours of cutting and 15 hours a week of of waiting for a customer seems more realistic. So 1500 hours of haircutting per barber (edit: 1650, but who cares). And dividing that into half a million hours of cuttable male hair per year gives me  333, the number of people needed to cut all that hair.<p>At this point you can start arguing about whether someone that caters to both men and women is truly a barber, or whether women can be said to be barbers even if they only cut men's hair. If your answers to those questions are no and no, and we go with the stereotype of a barber as a man who only cuts other men's hair, then I'd halve these numbers and guess that the number of 'pure' barbers in SF is 75-100.<p>OK, so this is 10 minutes of my life I won't get back, but if I was going to market something specific to barbers then I now have a decent guess at the number of potential customers in my local metro area.<p>Of course, you could have just said 'pass me a copy of the Yellow Pages and I'll tell you'. So having done the above, I went and looked that up and got 131 results at <a href=""http://www.superpages.com/yellowpages/C-Barbers/S-CA/T-San+Francisco/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.superpages.com/yellowpages/C-Barbers/S-CA/T-San+F...</a> ...with 2 or 3 cutters at each shop, that would suggest somewhere in the 3-400 range, but some of these entries are for Salons and some are in Daly city or Sausalito, not quite in San Francisco. Still not definitive, but not too far off either. Sure, there's a <i>lot</i> of guessing and hand-waving here...but the important thing is that I arrived at an estimate that roughly correlates with reality. In this case I was able to check that reality (by looking up the number of self-identified barbering businesses) but once you become adept at this technique you can use it for anything, and then get on with solving the problem instead of feeling stuck by a lack of information.",1258142091

940640,comment,940521,940521,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"In the enterprise world, this is known as ""lead generation"", and these queries for specific items would be ""qualified leads"" (meaning the buyer has specifically expressed interest in the type of product you're selling). It is a very profitable segment of the industry. That said, there are an awful lot of problems bringing the model to consumer goods.<p>The instant gratification problem that naval pointed out in the comments...Most folks have a buying process something like: Want, shop around for a few minutes to a few hours, buy, have it within a week.  Sometimes it includes going to see it in person at a brick and mortar. Waiting for a bunch of people (most of whom will be spammers) to submit proposals, is tedious and boring...like being at work. A lot of enterprise product buyers even try to avoid that process. I have a Dell small business sales rep, who usually gets me better prices than the website, but I rarely go through him because the process is tedious. It wastes more of my time than the money I save. I imagine if I were buying dozens or hundreds of machines, it would begin to be worth it.<p>The spam problem is always underestimated by people who don't deal with it professionally. By the time Scott Adams sees the spam problem in his own life, it has already made it through several anti-spam preventative systems. This is a new way to spam, and will require new ways to fight it. I suspect one of the lead generation models would have to be used...as dpatru suggested, vendors paying a small amount to be displayed to the user would be a good path. A vendor would probably happily pay a few pennies, or even dollars, to reach someone that they honestly believe would be a good fit for their product. In the enterprise world, you only need a few vendors, a few buyers, and very expensive products, to make the model profitable. In the consumer space, you need <i>all</i> the vendors to make consumers really happy, and an awful lot of consumers to make it worthwhile for vendors to monitor and respond to leads.<p>It's an interesting take on how vendors in this highly distributed world can find out what people really want.  Chinese manufacturers make almost everything we buy these days...but what items people need and want, fashion, trends, perception of quality and beauty, are different across cultures.<p>But, I don't think it will win out over automated recommendation and search engines. Automated tools will get better (and have gotten dramatically better in the past ten years) at helping folks find the right items. Amazon is already pretty darned good at it...I <i>usually</i> know which of a handful of items in a genre I want within a few minutes of beginning my search. At worst I read a few reviews, and then know. The Amazon model has the benefit of having <i>other customers</i> telling me about the products...I have a deep mistrust of companies telling me about their products. Some are honest and tell you exactly what you need to know, but most are hyperbolic to the point of being nonsensical.<p>In other words, this is one of those ideas that sounds neat, and is a really interesting thought exercise, but I really doubt I would <i>ever</i> use such a service, as a buyer or a seller.",1258141807

I think your wording doesn't make that clear.<p>When the cost of a false positive is high, e.g. a bad employee can be very expensive in terms of time and money before he is identified and fired if he is fired at all, then it is worth the cost of a few more false negatives to be more sure that you aren't getting false positives.<p>It seems that very often someone who is the victim of being a false negative will rail against the system and claim it is unfair.

If you really believe you are being taken advantage of, and management is unresponsive to requests for raises or additional equity then you have a choice.  You can passive-aggressively coast along being mediocre to milk a paycheck or you can find something better.  I refer to the former choice disparagingly because once you adopt this attitude then you have stopped training yourself for a startup environment.  Instead you are preparing yourself for the ass-covering world of corporate employment.  Maybe you can use this tactic to build a nice little nest egg to start your own business, but you will effectively have stopped learning about how to make a startup succeed.<p>The bottom line is that when you go to work for an entrepreneur, if they are any good they are going to milk you for all you're worth and its up to you to negotiate for what you think you deserve.  You wouldn't want to work for a startup where the entrepreneur gave away cash and equity like candy because those companies are orders of magnitude more likely to fail.<p>Ultimately if you want double-digit equity you need to become a founder yourself.  Whether to do this now, or continue working in other people's startups to gain experience is a strategic question that everyone needs to answer for themselves.  However whatever choice you make you shouldn't be bitter with the outcome unless promises were actually broken, and even then you just need to shake it off and chalk it up to experience.  A lot of people go the cynical route and I believe that is a huge mistake.<p>BTW I say this as a two-year 80-hour-a-week family-having 31-year-old working for someone else on less then 2% equity.  If we achieve some kind of exit I'll probably do my own thing next, otherwise I'll probably join another startup.",1258140784

Instead, the article is about how Steve Jobs has had four major successes as a CEO.<p>That is extremely, extremely rare. Google's founders are still young and much may happen between now and when they retire. But for the moment, the breathless prose lauding Mr. Jobs is quite nearly justified.",1258139597

Disabling cookies in my browser is like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  In addition to not being tracked by ads, I can't manage my bank account online or log into Hacker News.  Not fair.  This law makes it a requirement for me to be able to opt out of ad tracking, but still be able to log into websites (""essential purposes"").<p>This should not impact ad revenue either; the content site simply says ""by proceeding past this page, you consent to being tracked across the entire Internet by our advertisers and anyone they feel like selling your browsing habits to"".  Then the user can choose between privacy and your content.  Most will choose the content, judging from grocery store ""preferred customer"" programs, and so on.<p>It's important that regular users be able to easily opt out of cross-site tracking like Google Analytics; as many people would be outraged by the data it collects, if only they knew such a thing was possible.  Now they know, because you have to tell them what you're doing.  I think that's a good thing.",1258139533
940552,comment,940133,940133,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"The problem with tiny houses would seem to be resale value. I personally don't want a large house necessarily, but I want a really nice one. I want top of the line counters, ceramic floors, top-notch appliances, etc. It's not so much that I want more stuff, in fact I probably want less. It's more than I want nicer stuff. I think that's not uncommon. (It's also why if I had an infinite bankroll, my next startup would make a luxury version of the Corolla, but I digress.)<p>The problem is that if I put all that stuff into some tiny house, I'm stuck with it pretty much forever. Nobody else who can afford that stuff wants a 65 square ft house, or at least so few that I have no hope of getting a fair market value. It seems unlikely that will change, especially since by the time you can sanely afford these things you're probably near having a family.<p>One extremely way in which people value homes is $/sq.ft. Compare a 65 sq ft home to a 4,000 sq ft one, both with top of the line everything, and you're probably left with a market value about equal to what your dishwasher cost.<p>If I buy a 4,000 sq ft home and load it up I'll be able to sell it 10 years from now. Barring the very rare bubble bursting (like we're experiencing now) I'll probably be able to sell it for more than I paid for it. If I buy a 65 sq ft home and load it up, I'll be out a bundle.<p>So if money is not a constraint and you just want a smaller home, I think you have to find the happy median. Get a fully loaded 1,500 sq ft house and hell, just leave half of the rooms empty. There's certainly some size below which you're hemorrhaging money on the deal, and I imagine it's at least 1,500 sq ft here in Middle America.<p>If you have so much money that you don't care about resale value and you do care quite a bit about the environment this is probably fine. If you want laminate counters, vinyl floors, and cheap appliances, this solution might also be fine too. But for a large segment of the market this is unfortunately financially untenable, no matter how appealing.",1258139508

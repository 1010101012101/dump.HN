Really?  This is like saying dark blue is a darker blue then light blue.  OF COURSE.<p>Think of the best thing a facebook app can do.<p>Now think of 100 places where your interaction with an aspect of your environment could have improved UI (in a broad sense of what UI is).  Now think how easy it would be to replace the UI on everything with your iPhone.  Now think about how much better the UI would be if it were as elegant as iPhone.<p>In one corner.  FunWall.  In another, the sci fi future we all spent our childhood dreaming about.  This isn't a nailbiter, folks.<p>Like when a circle jerk is interrupted by an orgy, the facebook devs and their VCs are going to look stunned and out of place with their useless dicks in their hands when the real sex they aren't a part of starts.",1213338888

216592,comment,216181,216408,0,0,prospero,,,"It seems like there wouldn't be a lot of room for false positives in what you're suggesting.  Assuming that the pictures aren't all passport photos (face-on, high resolution, uniform lighting), there would be a lot of hand-holding required on the part of the user to get high accuracy on the matches.<p>You could make the user interaction straightforward, with some iterative attempt at matching face A with profile picture B (if the user nixes the match, the program would note that and try again), but that's still non-trivial.  I don't know that it'd be worth the trouble.",1213337905
216591,comment,216065,216500,0,0,apathy,,,"Realtime and near-realtime is hard in practical terms, not mathematical terms.  I work on the latter, and some days I miss working on the former.<p>If it were easy to get it right, and profitable to execute correctly, I have to imagine that a competitor would have done so by now.  But given the time and resource constraints, it seems that the problem remains difficult to manage, and I've always enjoyed that sort of challenge.<p>Developing heuristics for increasing statistical power, robustness, or informativeness is a mostly cerebral pursuit.  Operations is more bloody in-the-trenches mud wrestling.  And sometimes I look out from the ivory tower and I miss it.",1213337199

Since 1988 many prominent architecture astronauts have been convinced that the biggest problem to solve is synchronization.""<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/05/01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/05/01.html</a>",1213337185

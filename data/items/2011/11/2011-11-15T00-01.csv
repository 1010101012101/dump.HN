Zoom in far enough and you can see buildings on the edges of the pools.<p>Follow the little blue line upwards from the structure and you'll see a dam clearly pumping water, and the canals extend up to around 50km.<p>The Map View also shows a large area around it as a huge lake, so I'm guessing they drained the lake. Still pretty impressive in my opinion.",1321318799

On the one hand we have ""Intellectual Property Interests"" who are trying to extract every penny out of their ""assets"" while on the other hand we have the rest of us who are more and more irritated at being squeezed. The tension in key legislators between the folks who vote for them and the folks who pay for their elections is almost palpable.<p>Google, being bushwhacked by these people, is nicely not taking that sitting down. Its nice to see, but so far it has been like watching a court room lawyer and a bright high school student debate what is 'right' and 'wrong.' Fortunately they are a well funded high school student and they generally learn from their mistakes.<p>As the music labels die off, we can watch them to understand how it might go for others in their shoes, I am sure the book publishers are paying close attention. Your grandkids will read about this time in history and economics text books that is for sure.",1321318791

Some impressions:<p>The first thing I did was edit my profile, but I found that it doesn't give me enough feedback about errors. I tried changing everything all at once(of course) and then got greeted with the previous defaults. It took some trial and error to figure out that it wasn't accepting the RGBA PNG I had picked out for a profile picture. I'd also like a direct link to the markdown formatting docs, or even just a quick summary, on the profile editing screen.<p>My profile finished, I proceeded to look in my Dropbox folder. The README is not formatted for Windows Notepad and appears as one long line of text. I switched to NP++ and continued to write a ""hello.txt"" containing a link and an image. It shows up, so I go back and edit the README, too. Everything is in order, but what is this ""cloud+arrow"" button? Inspecting it reveals it's publishing, but I don't feel confident about whether I've published hello.txt until I log out and check.<p>I might continue using this. Some last thoughts:<p>I will probably want options to organize posts. There isn't enough documentation to know if I already have them.<p>I found myself wondering if there was a shortcut for marking up the image that would let me point to a folder inside Dropbox without tabbing out to find the public link.<p>I may not want the displayed title of README to be README.",1321318362

The fact that the compiler writes that dumb plumbing code for you is a great argument for exceptions, but not all applications fit the use case of:<p><pre><code>  * Same error can manifest itself in many places
  * Each instance of the error can be dealt with in a similar-enough way to make a common exception handler simpler than handling errors at each call site.
</code></pre>
Edit: Oh, did you mean that if you <i>don't</i> intend to handle an error, exceptions crash your program (good) rather than let it continue silently and do something you don't expect (bad)?  If so, good point, and my apologies for the misunderstanding :)",1321317255

He said my BMI was too high, and that I should lose weight.  I countered that BMI was not an accurate gauge of obesity, because it failed to take into account body composition and muscle mass (it just uses height and weight).  I am 6 feet tall and weigh 240 pounds...but then so are many professional football players.<p>I think we need a better measurement than BMI, that would take into account height, weight, waist/hip ratio, age, and body fat % to give a more accurate picture.  Seeing how this measurement changes over time would be a better gauge of health, and not just losing weight.  In some cases, gaining muscle would cause you to gain weight, but it would be healthier for you.  Conversely, losing weight by shedding muscle would lower your BMI, but be less healthy.<p>So I guess tools that would be more helpful would be tools that give a better picture of how healthy I am, and not just my weight.  So if my weight goes up, but my muscle mass went up and fat went down, that would be a good thing.<p>And tools that would help me track how small changes over time add up would be helpful.  For example, I can't go to the gym for an hour 3 days a week, but I can walk a half mile to lunch and back each day for a total of 5 miles a week.  Can you tell me how much weight I'd lose doing that for a year?  Or how many calories I'd avoid if I switched from sugar to Splenda for 2 cups of coffee every day for 6 months?  That might be the motivation I need to make small changes that don't seem significant, but can add up.<p>EDIT:  So apparently walking 1 mile each business day at lunch at a brisk pace for a year is good for about 30,000 calories or 10 pounds, and switching from sugar to Splenda is good for another 25,000 calories, or another 7 pounds.  I think that is a good start for an app...showing people how these small changes can add up.",1321317119

When we built Reader we decided that instead of trying to bolt an API on later we'd have our UI go through our own API. This would help ensure that our API was ""complete"" and would stay that way -- if you could do something in Reader, chances are the API supported it. (I feel like this is obvious, yet so many web apps don't do things this way.)<p>Our original plan was to document the API, but it turned out that there was a separate project going on concurrently to create a ""standard"" sort of API for Google products, GData. Reader's API wasn't GData compliant, and actually used a very different philosophy from GData. GData is CRUD-centric while Reader's API was pretty much just RPCs over HTTP. RPCs with side-effects would go over POST and those without would use GET. We also supported responses in either XML or JSON. GData used Atom for everything (something I found a bit ironic), though later GData added a sort of JSON support (really XML in JSON syntax -- Object literals with XML namespaces).<p>Anyway, my point is that GData was very different from Reader's API. We were told we'd have to GData-ify our API before publishing it since all new APIs were supposed to be GData. Nobody was really interested in doing that, so the only API documentation that exists is ""unofficial"".",1321316549

He set out to raise $10,000 and exceeded it by far in under 2 weeks, gets thrown into the startup spotlight, the pressure gets intense, and all the while he probably had the mindset of someone doing something much smaller. Not to assume what his thoughts were but it seems like he was just trying to something small and cool and it grew far larger than anyone had anticipated so fast that wasn't enough time to adjust and them that depression snuck in there and now he's gone.<p>It's so sad. I wonder if the lightning fast growth of Diaspora had anything to do with it. I wonder what effect being in the spotlight can have on someone unprepared for it.",1321316351

3236304,comment,3233526,3235924,1,0,dpark,,,"> <i>I guess this is where we differ. I feel that the designers of the .NET library have chosen to throw exceptions in places where nothing exceptional is actually happening, where no error has occurred, where the programmer may very well be expecting the ""exceptional"" outcome.</i><p>When does this actually happen?  Are you really <i>expecting</i> it to fail when you open a file, or when you parse an integer, or whatever else?  Where is .Net throwing exceptions in cases that no error has occurred and that you expect?<p>This complaint is common, but it feels rather hollow to me.  Most of the time it seems to come down to a preference for error codes over exceptions, or an annoyance with the try-catch boilerplate, rather than a legitimate complaint about exceptions being thrown inappropriately.<p>> <i>Where my code must handle such conditions, forcing me to handle them as exceptions makes my code longer, less readable, harder to change, and harder to reason about.</i><p>Are you suggesting that every function should have two versions like <i>Parse</i> and <i>TryParse</i>?  Is this really what you'd prefer the .Net team work on, instead of providing new tools and functionality?  Or are you wanting something like ""ON ERROR RESUME NEXT"" so that you can ignore these ""expected"" errors?<p>> <i>This is exactly what the author of the linked piece points out, this is a part of my complaint, and it's an issue Microsoft has tacitly acknowledged the seriousness of by the addition of alternatives to exception-throwing calls, like TryParse().</i><p>Eh, the linked piece seemed mostly to be pining for the days of error codes.  There's no general way to determine if a failure is a ""bug"" or ""expected"", not for exceptions and not for anything else.  If you want to avoid exceptions for ""expected"" failures, then you're asking for no exceptions at all, which is fine, but the problem isn't just the definition of ""exceptional"".<p>> <i>It does not feel to me, as a user of these massive libraries, that there was any systematic way of deciding what should be and what should not be reported as an exception.</i><p>The systematic way was ""it's exceptional if it's not the desired or expected outcome"".  The addition of TryParse was a nice bonus, but is in itself an exception to the exception model.",1321316061

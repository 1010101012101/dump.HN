When I finally found out that even my gmail was being surveyed to build a profile about me,  I decided that personally it had gone too far.  But if we really want to change it we have to stop playing into the business model and we have to start educating the users.  That is one of the main reasons that I started Rebil (shamless plug: rebil.co ).  I plan to fight this battle not with adblock, but by creating products that are open and honest with their consumers and deal openly in currency rather than hidden data transactions.  The question is, will consumers value their data and their privacy enough to pay for services?  I think they will and I am betting on it.",1428296222

If you think about the web as the penultimate democracy for content, where content of the highest quality is available to even the poorest person, then saying &quot;pay for this or you&#x27;ll remain ignorant&quot; is just not fair.<p>Example: I would be more ok if Coursera/Udacity and the like went with an ad-based model rather than a pay-per-view model. Why? Because the people it&#x27;s meant to help - the individual who can&#x27;t afford to take out massive loans to pay for school or the kid from the bad side of town - can&#x27;t really benefit if it costs 100&#x27;s or 1000&#x27;s of $$ to study, say, computer science or the like.<p>Retort: But there are a number of other free resources!

You missed §205(e) of that Act, which modifies Public Law 102-140 §303(a) to read:<p><pre><code>    SEC. 303. (a) The Judicial Conference may, only to the extent necessary,
    prescribe reasonable fees, pursuant to sections 1913, 1914, 1926, and 1930 of
    title 28, United States Code, for collection by the courts under those sections
    for access to information available through automatic data processing equipment.

So, your citation actually disagrees with you. I didn&#x27;t bother to study further to see if this has been amended (it almost certainly has), because I was mainly interested in your defensive citation.<p>As I said, these are based on costs. The method of determining those costs is probably flawed and we can debate that all day long, but the fees are legally permitted.

Additionally, it is likely that you&#x27;ll be building said SPA with a team of developers who have varying skill levels.

To be clear, I used my computer, on the Internet, to download a couple dozen documents in a U.S. federal criminal trial, and I paid $2.60 instead of having to drive to the courthouse in San Jose and wait in line. I spent more than that for coffee today.<p>Somehow this is an outrage, apparently, but I had to scroll for five minutes to find out why. A reporter from the <i>Times</i> reading a PACER case is generating more than the $10-$15 she will spend on the case when she publishes the investigative report. The one day a year I need PACER, it&#x27;s pretty much free for me. I simply cannot comprehend the outrage here, because public records clearinghouses are by their very nature special cases. His problems are not my problems.<p>Why is the approach here to spitefully crawl the service and make it more expensive for everyone, rather than designing a clearinghouse for open access data of all forms in a marketable solution for governments to use? PACER does much, <i>much</i> more than docket access, too, and it shows in the text that the guy is not a lawyer. Legal teams pretty much live on PACER when they&#x27;re in a federal case, and you file through it as well.",1428294499

Frontrunning isn&#x27;t really a problem. Did you know the majority of orders are price IMPROVED, in part due to the activities of high frequency traders? Meaning, you place an order to buy at $10 and it&#x27;s filled at $9.995 because some HFT wanted your order flow so they improve the best quote by 1/2 penny to get to fill your order.<p>Moreover, if you&#x27;re a buy-and-hold investor, even if you were &quot;front run&quot; you would never even know nor miss the 1/2 penny per share or whatever.<p>Respectfully, this is just a subject that&#x27;s complicated and it to grok it you need to give it some real thought.",1428292816

In general, an arrow/line between Controller and View is better understood as &quot;there is some type of communication&quot;; then, different variations of the same design will use different forms of communication (observers, data binding, the controller references the view, the view references the controller etc).",1428292808

But the writer went further, to claim that by and large even the people who were already regular users of word processors and spreadsheets would have little desire to work on them anywhere but in the office and at home: not that it was still infeasible or not worth the trouble, but that they just weren&#x27;t interested in doing so. It wasn&#x27;t that he didn&#x27;t foresee hardware and price improvements, he just largely dismissed them as pushing on that rope. That really was just a classic prediction clanger, and it was already disconfirmed by about 1989 when the Compaq LTE <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq_LTE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq_LTE</a> began the modern notebook era.",1428292804

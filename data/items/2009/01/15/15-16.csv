435261,comment,433885,435103,0,0,anamax,,,"> Darcs, at least, broke new ground. It was a very innovative VCS.<p>Innovative does not mean valuable, or, more important, popular.<p>I proposed the theory that languages become popular because they make creating new things possible and/or easier.<p>If Darcs qualifies as such a new thing, the fact that it didn't help popularize haskell argues against my theory.<p>Maybe my theory is wrong.  (I'd certainly patch it in certain ways.)  Maybe Darcs doesn't qualify.  Maybe Darcs didn't do the trick because no one knows about it.<p>So, let's flip the question.  What has the Haskell community done that has been important in making other languages popular in the past?  If they're not doing any of those things, why should Haskell nevertheless become popular? (Note that lots of ""superior"" languages never became popular, so if you're going that route, you get to explain why Haskell will be different.)",1232035103

From the article:<p><i>Recent animal studies have shown that clioquinol - an 80-year old drug once used to treat diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disorders - can reverse the progression of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. [...] Researchers at McGill University have discovered a dramatic possible new answer: According to Dr. Siegfried Hekimi and colleagues at McGill's Department of Biology, clioquinol acts directly on a protein called CLK-1, often informally called ""clock-1,"" and might slow down the aging process. [...]<p>""Because clock-1 affects longevity in invertebrates and mice, and because we're talking about three age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, we hypothesize that clioquinol affects them by slowing down the rate of aging.""

Worse, it was an on-going, five-year, choice even after the initial assessments (WMDs and troops required) were proven wildly wrong. The surge, for Bush, was a last resort, when it should have been first, second, or even third. It's not that folks opposed the surge. They just thought it was two or three years too late.<p>Then there were the choices to build a huge, new and repetitive bureaucracy (DHS), to give out massive tax cuts in a time of ""war"" without commensurate sacrifices from the American people (e.g., gas tax), and to belittle whatever moral and legal superiority our society is supposed to offer by torturing people. The choices for the economy were made in response to catastrophe not as it became increasing clear something was wrong. So the bailout packages end up being far bigger than if the problem had been addressed with true leadership.<p>See, that's my problem with Bush. He just wasn't a democratic leader in any sense of the those terms. There was no effort to reconcile differing opinions, foment and shape debates, and arrive at conclusions that we could get behind.

It's become mature enough that there are sites now where curious developers can congregate and exchange ideas.<p>When I started in the field the internet wasn't on the radar of businesses. Email accounts were uncommon never mind blog sites. Most book stores didn't carry books on academic topics. Besides, the wave of OO was just starting to gather so 9 out of 10 books were on OO or C++ or both.<p>Developers are now exposed to more and can share code and techniques. More complex problems are shared now causing  curious developers to stretch their limits.<p>The largest problem I see now with adoption of Haskell is the us/them mentality of field trained developers vs. academically trained ones. I'm in the former group. While not all academically trained developers code/design well, the median one has been exposed to a wider range of coding problems and tools. Our ability to share ideas and problems on the internet levels that playing field if we let it.<p>In short, yes, mainstream developers are ready for Haskell/Lisp/OCaml/etc. We need to get over the ""that's just for academics"" mentality. They are tools, thought out by people with lots of brains and time on their hands, to solve problems. The only thing holding us back is our mentality.",1232031724

The kit prices seem reasonable - only about $30-40 per square foot - but the all-in costs are far higher. Here is the information from the FAQ at Romero's website: <a href=""http://www.rocioromero.com/LVSeries/faqs.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rocioromero.com/LVSeries/faqs.htm</a><p><i>On average the home costs $120 sq/ft to build. This includes kit costs, shipping, foundation, and finish costs.  This price does not include the cost of land.  In the Mid West it can be built between $100-120 sq/ft and in California as well as certain select areas on the East Coast have higher sq. ft. labor costs, the average is between $120-195 sq ft.</i><p>The kits do not come with insulation.

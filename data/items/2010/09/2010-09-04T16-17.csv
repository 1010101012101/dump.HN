1662971,comment,1661986,1661986,0,0,hvs,,,"Maybe unrelated, but this made me think of ""The Rise of 'Worse is Better'"":<p>(NOTE: In this context, ""PC"" means ""Program Counter"".)<p>""... The PC loser-ing problem occurs when a user program invokes a system routine to perform a lengthy operation that might have significant state, such as IO buffers. If an interrupt occurs during the operation, the state of the user program must be saved. Because the invocation of the system routine is usually a single instruction, the PC of the user program does not adequately capture the state of the process. The system routine must either back out or press forward. The right thing is to back out and restore the user program PC to the instruction that invoked the system routine so that resumption of the user program after the interrupt, for example, re-enters the system routine. ...""<p><a href=""http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html</a>",1283619568

1662967,comment,1661861,1662941,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>You are talking about temporary natural catastrophes, though, not the kind of disasters that develop slowly.</i><p>It's easier to give examples of that which people can readily see.  For a ""slower"" problem, how about the general trend that people are living longer?  IIRC, when social security was invented in the US (which you qualify for after age 65), the average life expectancy here was 67.  It was intended to make life easier for folks in extreme old age.  Now this country is in crisis trying to figure out how to deal with the fallout from supporting people for decades when it was only designed to do so for a couple of years.<p>Also, the last statistics I heard on bankruptcy in the US is that more than half of all bankruptcies here are due to high medical bills. Bankruptcy in the US is generally chalked up to ""irresponsible behavior"".  In reality, it is more often due to devotedly doing whatever it takes to try to save the life of a loved one.<p>Then there is cystic fibrosis.  The life expectancy in recent decades has gone from age 18 to age 37-ish.<p>As for people living in squalor:  The US definition of poverty routinely places 12-14% of the US population under the poverty line.  But one study I read indicated that less than 1/2% of Americans qualified as ""poor"" by the standards of India when measured not by income but by things like ""number of meals eaten per day"" and whether or not they had a roof over their head.  Plus I currently live with zero furniture and no car and generally few possessions.  I'm happy this way and healthier than when I had the stereotypical American lifestyle of affluenza.  So I am not sure what you mean by ""a huge percentage ...living in squalor"".  Perhaps you would like to clarify what standard you think ""everyone"" should live by?  Given that giving up my possessions has been a keystone to getting healthier, I have my skepticism about (and objections to) ideas that material wealth is a terribly important measure of quality of life.<p>Thanks.",1283619469

1662916,comment,1661271,1661800,0,0,sr3d,,,"Answer? simple.  $150K/4 = $37.5K/year, an average tuition of a liberal arts collect.  I went to Lake Forest College, 1hr north of Chicago, and this was their tuition 5 years ago.  Did I pay the full-price? No.  I got a half-off scholarship for getting a SAT score above 1,200.  Simple.  I only paid ~ 16K/year (room & board included) for 4 years.  But there were people paying the full price.  I hope they make good money to pay all that debts.<p>4 years went by really fast, and before you know it, you're in great debt.  I don't think that people are totally irresponsible.  Here in the US you were taught to at a very young age to ""follow your dream"" and the rest would come.  For a 18 year old girl or guy, being so young and naive but having no clues about finance and the real cost of money (your life!), of course she/he would make a decision of following their dream.  However, undergrad debts are understandable.  If you make a wrong decision and can't get a job with a high enough salary to pay back the debt, at least it's early in your life so you can recover.  But if you're 25 and want to further defer the real hard life by getting a master degree of something you want (but probably don't need to), and along the way get in tons of debt, then you're financially irresponsible.<p>Higher education should not be this big of a financial burden for students, but it's pretty profitable and the US education system is still the best in the world, so there's a huge premium to go study here.  From my own experience, foreign students make really good and conscious choice about where to go and how to get a scholarship.  A lot of my international student friends got full scholarship to top schools, but this may not be the case for every one.  But they and their parents really come prepared to pay every dime for a good education that can help hem make the most out of their professional life after graduation.  I was too an international student.<p>My point of view in life is:  time is money, debt is negative money, thus you're subtracting time from you life to pay for debts.

1662907,comment,1662729,1662729,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I can't speak for Europe, but maybe I can shed some light on Japan.<p>Christianity had started to spread to Japan by 1600 from the Portugese, but after Hideyoshi Toyotomi unified Japan, he made Christianity illegal. After Toyotomi died, the Tokugawa government cracked down even harder, and Christianity was basically eliminated from Japan by 1700, leaving the hybrid Japanese Buddhist/Shinto religion where the Emperor was God-on-Earth as the sole major religion.<p>After Japan lost WWII, part of the surrender terms was that Emperor Hirohito had to admit he's not a god. During the occupation of Japan, MacArthur's team scrubbed away a lot of the traditional power and prestige of the Japanese native religion, leaving the country largely secular and atheist. They do have strong cultural values and ethics though, which serves some of a similar function that traditional religion does.",1283616711

For legibility, add in that if it's unreadable by your partner/friend, you have to redo that article (and not pick another article: that would be too interesting :).<p>If you have more time, handwriting a nightly journal or regular letters to someone is a more pleasant way to achieve the same goal.

Because of that the first few years of undergraduate are equivalent to European schools' last years (in breadth and a little harder in depth).<p>By the end of undergraduate they will have very much cached up (American schools may be bad, but Unis are top notch) but then in places like UK, students would have been a lot more focused. So once you move to PhD the first couple of years in the USA are more similar to what in the UK we call a master. Hence only the last few years of the PhD correspond to the 3 years of the European phd.<p>Overall I think the two system are equivalent in duration, it's just that in the USA they start from a lower step of the ladder.<p>(on top of this there may be difference in the focus: e.g. papers vs. thesis, but I am only talking about the durations.)",1283616081

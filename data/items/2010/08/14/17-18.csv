1603681,comment,1603562,1603562,0,0,nezumi,,,"The first thing to bear in mind is that language learning for an adult is a completely different proposition from language learning as a child. Kids are wired for it, they have the time, and usually have external pressure to make progress. Learning methods for kids therefore tend to be slow, tedious and - because kids haven't fully developed their capacity for abstract thought - dependent on rote memorization.<p>My recommendation would be to start with a Pimsleur course. Don't worry about writing and vocabulary at first, just get a feel for the language. With Arabic, you have a different alphabet to learn - do that before you try learning written vocabulary, or you will be forever hamstrung by romanized transliteration messing with your pronunciation.\nFor vocabulary, spaced repetition is the way to go. There are lots of sites and systems for this. Go with the ones that give you a high level of control over what you are studying, and train only production (i.e. going from English to Arabic), recognition will take care of itself.\nFor grammar, here's a cute idea I had some success with in Japanese which has highly regular grammar (I don't know about Arabic): as you learn the grammar rules, write code to produce them. E.g. write a function to conjugate the past tense. When it's working, you have the basis of a game to test yourself. Use your powers of abstraction to bypass rote memorization.<p>Don't be down about the fact you don't manage to keep studying religiously. As long as you get <i>some</i> studying done, no matter how little, you are making progress. There is a lot of snake oil out there - if you find something isn't fun or isn't working for you, don't try and force yourself. Most of us learnt languages the wrong way in school, and learned a lot of bad study habits and worst of all, got the idea that it's supposed to be hard and take a long time. Not true - use your experience of learning programming as a template for what your experience of learning a real language should be like.\n(assuming you are a programmer, apologies if not)",1281807430

At the time, to obtain work in Puerto Rico, you were required to be proficient in English.

There are a lot of different theories about the best way to learn language: immersion, multimedia, native speakers, etc. I think when you're learning a language for the first time though, there's so much ground to cover, that it doesn't matter which direction you take. The best direction is the one you can go furthest in (is the most sustainable because of interest, convenience, availability, etc.) which is most positive and least negative. I.e., we don't learn a language perfectly the first 100 times traversing through it. But gradually we get there.<p>But it's probably like with programming -- the most undervalued link is actually just putting yourself in front of it (as much as possible, in a sustainable manner). This can be something as simple as eating at a restaurant where they speak Arabic.

It isn't perfect, but I do feel like I have learned a lot with relative ease -- much more easily than I learned Spanish in middle and high school classes.<p>Advantages:<p>* Michel Thomas CDs are significantly cheaper than software-based programs<p>* audio format means you can study on your commute, rather than only in front of your computer, and you can easily use the CDs with a Free OS<p>* I like that the program is interactive, and there are two other students on the recording -- it feels like you're getting useful feedback that you wouldn't get practicing alone<p>Possible Disadvantages:<p>* the program's focus is on grammar, which is useful for me, but it does mean that you don't learn a lot of vocabulary; I am on the twelfth disc of 15, and the lessons have barely touched on the use of nouns. This might be a downside if you are trying to become conversant with native speakers.<p>* the audio format means you don't always get the spelling of new words (sometimes they are spelled aloud on the recording, but not always); I deal with this by looking new words up in a German dictionary as I hear them<p>I also bought a book (<i>German Quickly</i>, by April Wilson) designed as a crash course for students needing to pass a language exam.

For one, she talked about little children who were so hurt that they shut off all emotion - ""little stone children"" - and that was me, until the crisis that broke me open so badly that I was able to listen to the message in When Things Fall Apart.<p>As for the guilt… I had tremendous amounts of guilt. My mother used to beat me, and when I got big enough, I started to hit back. She became really mentally ill as I grew up, because she always chose to be a victim, and though she was still mean and abusive, she was also weak and helpless -- so naturally I hated myself for my lack of control as much as I hated her for abusing me. I moved out at 15 and change because I was quite sure I'd either kill her, or myself.<p>I also hurt (emotionally) other people when I was growing up because I was so torn and broken, and that tortured me for years.<p>The only thing that helped me was When Things Fall Apart.<p>In short, the lesson is this: Learn to practice compassion for every person. To be human is to be deeply flawed. Everyone is deeply flawed - and so everyone deserves a shot at redemption, or at least forgiveness. Forgiveness doesn't only help the person forgived -- that almost doesn't matter, but it helps the person doing the forgiving. Forgiveness also doesn't mean you let them hurt you more, but that you recognize that they are weak, scared, flawed, and hurting, no matter how horrible their exterior is... and that's really the default state of humanity.<p>If you realize that about other people… and you practice compassion and forgiveness for them… then you realize that you, too, are only human, deeply flawed, and worthy of redemption and forgiveness. Then you practice compassion and forgiveness for yourself.<p>Here's an excerpt from When Things Fall Apart, one that particularly struck a chord with me - one I will never forget:<p><i>It's as if you just looked at yourself in the mirror, and you saw a gorilla. The mirror's there; it's showing ""you"", and what you see looks bad. You try to angle the mirror so you will look a little better, but no matter what you do, you still look like a gorilla. That's being nailed by life, the place where you have no choice except to embrace what's happening or push it away.</i><p>That is the essence of lovingkindness meditation. And it really, honestly, works. I can admit now all the bad things I've done… it still hurts a little, but it's nothing like the overpowering guilt, shame and self-hatred I felt for myself before. I can talk about it in public, like here, and stand tall, even though I know people will judge me and hate me for it.<p>I'm sorry your living situation is so tenuous.<p>Please email me at amy @ slash7 com and I'll send you the MP3s of the Pema Chodron book. Nobody has to know you have them. And I'm sure Pema Chodron herself would approve of me sending them to you.",1281805788

But there's one big issue with their implementation, which is that if someone has decided to share content with a more limited group, there's no indication to those permitted to see it that it was ""exclusive"" and to whom.<p>Facebook's lack of clearly defined networks leads people to assume that the concept of ""friend"" is pretty egalitarian -- any content one friend can see, others can too.<p>This led to at least one embarrassing occasion where I said to a friend something to the effect of ""You're Facebook friends with <person>, I can't believe you haven't said anything about that scandalous picture they posted.""  Then we discovered that I was permitted to see that content and they weren't.  Drama ensues, and we both learn about a feature on Facebook we weren't aware of.<p>It seems like Facebook should somehow identify this restricted content in some manner, like ""You can see this because you are college friends with <person>"" or ""You and <these other people> may see this photo.""<p>The other alternative is that people only use Facebook to carry out their discussions about experiences and photos people post to Facebook, so that Facebook's access control will handle this for them.  This seems counterintuitive to the whole ""social"" aspect, because presumably Facebook is a place for real-life friends to easily share content online.",1281805256

His was a restless mind, always teaching, always learning, and always challenging us to greater things.  He got in trouble a lot.<p>Mark Jones:  My mentor as a nurse.  Up until him, I'd been surrounded by up-tight nurses who worried about more about a bed bath or a clean patient room while the patient was dying.   I could tell a lot of stories about Mark.  Like the day he cut his underwear off himself and threw them at another nurse while doing CPR without missing a beat.  Or, the day he was doing chest compressions in one hand and starting an IV in the other.  Again, not missing a beat.  He taught me that the most important thing was to take good care of the patient and have fun doing it.<p>Francis Schaeffer:  For teaching me that I didn't have to check my mind at the door to be a Christian.<p>Paul Graham (But not in a creepy or a suck up kinda way).  His communicating how the startup world works and how wealth creation works really changed me.  I was raised in the Banana Republics of Central America during the 70's and 80's, and really had no idea how the US worked, and how the whole money thing worked.  Paul's writings on the subject 4-5 years ago started me on a journey to where I am today.  I'm grateful for that.  He also taught me to give back.  It's important.",1207395719

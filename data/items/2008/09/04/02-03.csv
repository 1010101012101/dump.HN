As you say that's not easy.<p>Most 'normal people' haven't tried Firefox on someone else's machine & said 'I want this not that.' In fact, many are still on IE 6. So the bar for 'compelling' is high. You need someone who does not find the difference between IE6 & FF compelling to find Chrome compelling. Big call.<p>FF got to >15% on that sort of steam without much marketing (but still some). Google can probably out-market Mozilla.",1220496464

294453,comment,294448,294448,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Millionaire seems kind of a stretch, though the article linked to uses the phrase ""dollar millionaire."" The first company says 200 employees, $2 million revenue. The second one says $600k at $20/hour. So the first one is $10k per employee, the second one works out to 30,000 hours billed. There are only 8760 hours in a year.<p>My point is, these aren't freelance workers, they're businesses with employees. So ""freelance"" is misleading, and I suspect ""million"" is too.",1220496036

294445,comment,293942,294407,0,0,DaniFong,,,"You're not too far off.<p>There are two very different populations at Princeton: undergrads and grad students barely recognize each other's existence, much less talk with one another, and therefore don't found with one another.<p>The undergrads are constantly, <i>constantly</i> marauded by recruiters from wall street and consulting firms. Many of the rest are trying to get into med or law school.<p>The populations in the hard sciences, engineering, math, and comp sci are quite small. Most of those are in fields which don't found companies out of undergrad much -- molecular biology, for example. And of the hard sciences, the dominant cultural influence is from foreign students holding international science Olympiad medals. It draws the fire from the notion of founding a startup.<p>The rest are grad students. Some of these do found startups, but they're fewer, and farther from capital, and often quite set on an academic path. Plus, unlike at MIT or Stanford or Berkeley, there is, for some reason, an urgency on the part of the administration to get you graduated by your fifth year. Don't ask me why.<p>Also, it's just not as strong of an engineering school in most of the disciplines or fields that are startuppy. Even within comp sci, there are mostly people studying large systems, and theory, and parallelization, and security, and computer science policy, and compilers, and so on. Not so many in HCI. And since most startups succeed where they can fill a before unarticulated need, that hurts them.<p>Finally, it's a little bit of the product of the admissions department. Many people are admitted based on extracurriculars which look good on paper, but neither stretch one's abilities, nor are particularly novel (if they were, they'd be hard for admissions to understand), nor are particularly technical. Bleeding heart stuff. A lot of the startups that I saw come out of Princeton (which friends got involved in) are either vaguely defined environmental/political websites, or connected to academia in some way. Not to say Princetonians don't have the chops: both Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt came from the EECS department.",1220494769

294443,comment,294321,294421,0,0,alex_c,,,"Another vote here for Rothenburg.  It is perhaps even more ""medieval"" than Siena (though to be fair, I spent two days in Rothenburg, and only an afternoon in Siena).<p>The downside is that it is very tourist-y.  It almost seemed like the only things there were hotels, museums, and gift shops.<p>The upside is that it still feels authentic.  I picked my hotel pretty much just based on price and availability, and it was charming - you can even see it in random pictures like this one: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Street_in_Rothenburg.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Street_in_Rothenburg.JPG</a>  (I forget the name, but it's the one with the bell sign).  My friends stayed at a different hotel, and had the same experience.<p>Walking along the walls at night can be an amazing experience - it had rained earlier, it was foggy, street lights reflected off the cobblestones, and no tourists in sight... it felt like we were transported to a different century.<p>As for taverns, I would recommend Zur HÃ¶ll (meaning ""Hell""), it's supposed to be over 1000 years old - and if you manage to get the table in the basement (which is actually a giant bellows), that claim seems quite believable.<p><a href=""http://www.romanticroad.com/hoell/english/dine.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.romanticroad.com/hoell/english/dine.htm</a>",1220494357

294439,comment,294428,294428,0,0,pg,,,"Not quite.  There are certain sites and filetypes that are considered ""lightweight"" and whose scores are (currently) multiplied by .3.  These include tweets, images, Onion stories, Xkcd cartoons, and so on.<p>The new code has been running for a while, probably over a month.  I was wondering how long it would take users to notice.<p>This seemed the best solution to the problem of easy-to-upvote stuff like tweets and cartoons floating to the top of the frontpage.  I didn't want to ban them, but I didn't want to end up like reddit either, so I added a multiplier to compensate for lightness.<p>Edit: The initial ""Not quite"" no longer makes sense because the post has been changed based on my answer. Originally it was asking if per-user vote weighting had been turned on.",1220493662

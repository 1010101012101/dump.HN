Yes, in this report, you get more customers if you don't ask for credit-card upfront.<p>But, those 120 signups you get from 1000 trial signups, meaning, for each signed up customer you need to support over 8 trials (support here means your time and to a lesser extent, your service's resources).<p>For the 60 signups in the case where the credit card was asked upfront, there were 200 free trial signups, ie a bit over 3 trials per customer.<p>So which is better depends on how much money (or time) you invested in getting the 10000 interested visitors to site (prior to them signing up), and how much money (ie. time and other resources) you need to spend to get them to become paying customers.",1370249968

The frontend would be the part that interacts with the user (i.e. WinForms, Cocoa, GTK, etc. depending on your operating system and GUI library) and the backend would be code that interacts with the operating system, makes use of the network, manages the database, computes something interesting, etc.<p>A simple example would be to take a web project that you just built and bundle the backend and frontend together into an installer, have users download and install it, and only run it locally.  If you know a user's platform, you could conceivably replace individual web components with native ones.  Upon doing so, you have become a non-web full-stack developer.",1370249814

When it comes to people, if somebody is posting crap, I usually remove it from my timeline. I don't think Facebook is meant to exchange good ideas in public, but to share information. I don't want to be philosophical, but being bored is like everything else in life, you keep taking public transport, because it's useful, not that you are in love with it.
2. Facebook is not meant to build a community around a theme, you get information and feedback on pages but nothing more. Dedicated website on games, astronomy etc. were there before and will be there after.
3. I'm living abroad and share every week with my family on a Facebook private group, I just find the feature great!<p>In general I think that experiences in life are so different and all require a different set that you simply can't aggregate them all on one and unique website.

I think it's a bit of a cop out, and feels like they want recognition that their child is special and deserves attention.<p>No one ever looks at this from a teachers perspective. They are caught in the middle of trying to help children with wide variety of learning styles and the political machine of a school district  learning mandate. They can only do so much to help. If a parent feels their child doesn't fit the mold and thinks the system is rigged, they should help their child understand how the school system work and how that relates to the rest of the working world. Where nearly everything else is based on metrics.<p>If they feel their child understand the material but the tests and homework are causing problems, find the path that accomplishes the goals of a passing grades. You'd be surprised if you just ask, that a teacher will tell you what they are going to be grading on. Is it just test or is it an overall judgement of how the child is doing?<p>As a kid I figured out that the key to ""doing well"" was to impress by showing off in areas where you really do excel. Is the child more creative? Then answer the homework or tests with creative answers and get the answer they are looking for but done in a fashion that may be different than what was expected. Do they have to do a book report? Make that look better than every other kid in class.<p>In short I pretty much skated through middle school and high school by doing the bare minimum to achieve an C but impressed in other creative areas that demonstrated effort and ability to comprehend the material.<p>Anyway that's my rant.",1370248836

In fact, ELisp with this weird concept of I/O through buffers makes a lot of sense for a text editor and I find it quite an elegant concept (not always practical, though). And while ELisp is not really CL, the lacking parts are the interpreter and runtime themselves, not the language.<p>Writing elisp is not hard. What's hard is integrating all the modes, keymaps and quirky behavior of coupling all these smalls bits of code together. <i>This</i> is what makes emacs hard. Emacs, the ""core editor"" itself, is incredibly small. Way smaller than vim (build it by hand if you don't believe it). Emacs as the editor that you use every day is almost pure extensions.<p>There's a /whole lot/ of global state in an editor. This is <i>not</i> going to change with Python, Guile or any other language. Users that complain about ELisp, most of the time actually never tried to write ELisp at all (they just glue some elisp around in .emacsrc). That's fine, but they don't realize what's going on under the hood. The C/C++ mode in emacs is completely different to the ""stupid"" syntax highlighting in Vim or most other editors.<p>I normally recommend switching to another editor if after several years you still don't appreciate the difference. IMHO emacs, as it is, is a great editor. ELisp is part of the success (though guile would be a step forward).",1370248241

5811987,comment,5809012,5809012,2,0,NTDF,,,"Very interesting thread. I moved to SV a year ago and my perspective on how modern programmers think has changed enormously.<p>As a background, I am a software engineer on route to being a cpu architect. My job is to understand how hardware works and what changes need to go into the instruction set to allow modern software work better. I have some thoughts to share.<p>I also think that a lot of folks in HN are true software engineers with little hardware background. So, most arguments simply gloss over why (or why not) use C.<p>Let us all be very clear. C is not a great language for app development. This comes from a person who has worked his entire life with C. I have no qualms in saying this.<p>C is primarily just an abstraction over assembly (not the same as machine). With this in mind, you can safely assume C to be a ""stateful"" language. By ""stateful"" I mean, each statement gets ""executed"" and the state of the CPU and memory changes. The fact that multiple assembly instructions can get produced per-line of C is what makes it better than lower languages.<p>That is all that is there in C. Everything else is an add-on. The standard library functions (strlen(), printf() etc.)  are all essentially a few assembly instructions clubbed together.<p>Now, as it turns out, oop and other paradigms were created for the sole purpose of making it easy to program. In other words, we want to lower the barrier of entry into programming and have more programmers do things that they would normally never be able to do. We were ready to take a performance penalty with higher level languages so that more people can make useful stuff with a computer.<p>For example, oop was made to create the illusion that a program really is objects interacting with each other or functional execution. However, folks well versed with the computer know that oop is eventually executed sequentially.<p>The whole eco-system of web and app developers is able to thrive because they do not have to deal with 'nasty' (I personally find them amazing) issues of why things work the way they do. Let's just say that programming is becoming commoditized and the barrier to programming is made lower by them not having to deal with these issues. If we were still programming in C, most programmers would have dropped out of their CS classes when they were freshmen.<p>An analogy would be you don't need to understand the internals of a combustion engine to drive a car.<p>So, should everyone learn C? As someone who cares about expanding the powers of a computer, I do not think wasting resources on it is worthwhile. There are enough people maintaining C and using it for great purposes. Commodity programming (application level) should not involve C as far as possible. Cpus are fast enough to handle bloatware languages. I would personally prefer people thinking of newer languages/paradigms that would expand on what people can do with a computer.<p>As a programmer, you do not need to learn it. It is certainly helpful and I would definitely encourage folks to try to understand it, if you are curious. But no point wasting your time on it if all you are going to do is application level development.<p>Now, if you are working on something really deep and involved, the story changes completely. For example, folks working on router/switch programs, fast search engines, OS, devices, simulations (basically everything cool in my biased mind) need to understand it.<p>An analogy is that an you do not need to understand nitty-gritty details about engines unless you are building something in the range of a Ferrari.<p>Just my thoughts.",1370247084

The sender should think about the receiver and send only stuff that would be interesting to him, or help him even if he does not like it at once.  The sender should have means to target his messages only to people who would like it.  The receiver should have means to express what he liked and what he did not.  Channels should be negotiated between the receiver and the sender.<p>I call this 'social routing'.

5811979,comment,5809724,5810193,6,0,drostie,,,"If you ignore the fact that the vertical and horizontal aren't scaled the same (which can be part of the last step in the rendering code) then you can define a hexagon as six lines in [x y] space, as defined by their endpoints:<p><pre><code>    [[0 0]  [0 2]]
    [[0 0]  [1 -1]]
    [[0 2]  [1 3]]
    [[1 -1] [2 0]]
    [[1 3]  [2 2]]
    [[2 0]  [2 2]]
</code></pre>
These can be lexicographically ordered, meaning that if you construct a <i>set</i> of lines transformed by [(min p1 p2) (max p1 p2)] rather than a <i>list</i> of [p1 p2], you'll never have doubled lines -- the integer comparisons are exact, and each line has a canonical representation. Moving along the ""horizontal"" above is translation by [2 0] while moving along the diagonal is translation by [1 3], so it really is integers all the way through.<p>Since these translations [2 0] and [1 3] are the same distance in the real grid, our final scaling for the actual points is [x y] -> [x y/sqrt(3)]. As you note, rounding sqrt(3) inconsistently may create problems where not all hexes appear the same size, but we can fix that by using a rational approximation to 1/sqrt(3). Here are the first few best-rational-approximations to 1/sqrt(3) as determined by its continued fraction:<p><pre><code>    0, 1, 1/2, 3/5, 4/7, 11/19, 15/26, 41/71, 56/97, 153/265, 209/362
</code></pre>
So if you have hexes which must be around 50 px wide, we can arbitrarily choose 52 px and use the transform:<p><pre><code>    [x y] -> [26*x, 15*y]
</code></pre>
And then we get integer-pixel-perfection, by stating by fiat that our hexes are not <i>perfect</i> but just <i>good enough</i>. Since we chose a great approximation the error is actually only 0.74% so people presumably won't really notice.",1370246969

Typical Day at the Job<p>Here is how a typical day will look like. You start by looking the status of the production dashboard and bugs. With a quick scan you find that that the message counts are not getting updated in the dashboard after the code push last night. You jump on it right way and send a short code-review out, after testing it on your staging setup.<p>With that out of the way, you get back to the feature that you have been working on. You know exactly why you are building this feature and what impact it will have on the customers. The feature was specced out last week in some intense design discussions. You finished a quick prototype yesterday. You throw it out today and start the code and unit testing for the initial release. The plan is to deploy a basic version this week sometime, gather feedback over a few days and then fine-tune it based on what the customers say.<p>Just after lunch, while you code, you come across a bug in the queuing sub-system. You decide that it would be simple for you to fix it as well and so you do. While you fixed the bug, you thought about how you can make the queuing system much more scalable. You write a quick note to yourself to talk about it later.<p>By the end of the day you'll have a good chunk of the new feature implemented. You'll send that queuing system bug fix for code-review tomorrow morning and continue your work of the new feature.<p>How the role will develop<p>Initially, the tasks you take on will be smaller and fairly well defined. Longer term, the requirements you get will be more general, and youll interpret them to produce great solutions. Youll also generate tasks on your own initiative as you identify opportunities.<p>As we grow, we may need to take on more developers. Youll have the opportunity to be responsible for these folks if you want.<p>Technical Qualifications<p>You will be,<p><pre><code>     fluent in Django and Python and comfortable using Git
     be happy with HTML and Javascript
     have designed and written applications using Django
     comfortable managing a group of remote linux servers.
</code></pre>
You'll have the opportunity to work on all areas of our stack. Our technology stack includes,<p><pre><code>     Django, Python, Erlang
     Redis, MySQL
     RabbitMQ, Celery
     MemCache
     Bootstrap, JQuery, Javascript

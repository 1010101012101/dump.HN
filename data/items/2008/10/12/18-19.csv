In other words, we no longer find our work rewarding in any way.  The 5 day work week and 2 day weekend provides a convenient cycle of guaranteed regular reward.  But, two days isn't a lot of time, so instead of having leisure time we are compelled to spend our weekends in a productive manner, e.g., scheduled and regimented instead of whatever may suite-our-fancy.<p>This is in contrast to the work, quite, have fun until you go broke cycle of ages past, or of the work all-the-time until disrupted by a series of holy feast days or town faire/circus.<p>In my short work life I've certainly found my traditional path of college to cube completely unsatisfying.  I thought working for a nonprofit was a way to combine work and reward.  But, I found being a staffer at a nonprofit, at least in Washington DC, isn't really any different than a ""soulless"" forprofit.<p>Changing to an IT consulting job six months ago has been more rewarding, but I dream of being a carpenter or some other job that is more practical, rewarding, team-oriented, and creative.<p>Either way, I'm looking for something that lets me spend my time with longer cycles or work and leisure so that I can engage in bigger projects and times of leisure without interruption.<p>Modern society's 5 day on and 2 day off cycle for white collar workers, however, is not conducive to anything outside of it's rigid structure...",1223837666

330419,comment,330362,330362,0,0,dmv,,,"I am surprised at the fast and loose use of numbers and assumptions[1] put in this article.  I expect more from the Financial Times.  Even if we accept the numbers to establish that the United States and its citizens have a negative net-worth, that is not equivalent to bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy is a legally declared inability to pay creditors.  If the US Government ever makes that declaration... wow.  We as a country have not defaulted on our debts, and based on the strength of the treasury market, few are betting on that scenario.<p>Martin Feldstein's proposal is so much less radical, as presented here (I am otherwise unfamiliar with it).<p>[1] For example: ""The debt secured on half or more US homes will be worth more than the home itself, with little or no prospect of a quick rebound in housing values to rebuild positive equity. In the circumstances, many households may conclude that it is rational to walk away rather than pay over-the-odds for an asset the price of which has no realistic chance of regaining its former value in the short to medium term. The resulting wave of repossessions would only depress prices further.""  That might be true if housing were some simple investment vehicle... but it is not.  My assumption: at worst, most people view a mortgage like credit card debt or an auto loan -- you don't consider the asset being backed, you focus on the payment.  With the exception of speculative housing investors, most foreclosures seem (as reported) to be about an inability to make payments.  Recall the existence of mortgage structures that accumulated negative equity: this is not an indication of savvy investors focused on ROI.",1223834776

330415,comment,330375,330375,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I wonder if a similar effect is behind male/female differences in mathematical, scientific, and computing fields.<p>Mathematics usually requires that you go deep into a field, through a long chain of prerequisites.  In order to understand general relativity, you need to understand differential geometry, which requires tensors and calculus, which requires vectors and linear algebra, which requires algebra, which requires arithmetic.  In order to understand Haskell, you need to understand monads, which requires parametric data types and type classes, which requires algebraic data types, and so on.<p>Meanwhile, female-dominated skills like communications, law, or management usually require a broad base of knowledge and a relatively shallow chain of prerequisites.  Lawyers have to know a ton of information to do their jobs, but much of it consists of court precedents that build upon the basic principles taught in first-year law school.<p>For that, matter, among the sciences, the ones with the largest female populations are those that require a broad base of knowledge rather than a deep chain of prerequisites.  Compare biology and geology to physics and advanced mathematics.",1223834595

That's demonstrably, decisively false: the ""program"" that covers the uninsured first denies them long-term preventative coverage, then forces them into emergency rooms, and finally drives them into bankruptcy. It is the most expensive, least efficient mechanism for all parties involved.<p>The easiest way to come to the conclusion that the government would do better is to recognize that the only way we could possibly do worse would be to let people die in the emergency room instead of treating them.<p>Your argument appears merely to redefine the word ""covered"" to mean ""screwed"".",1223834468

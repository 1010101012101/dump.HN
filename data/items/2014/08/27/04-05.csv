8230904,comment,8229081,8229081,1,0,Apollo1101,,,"Interesting thread.\nOne thing I think is missing from this discussion is how significantly even the nature of transportation has changed in the era of mobile phone tech.  Some context: I live in Seattle, grew up in Minneapolis, went to school in New York, and my aunt and uncle lived/live in Manhattan and have for the last 25 years. I recently got them to experiment with Uber in New York. They rarely take taxis, so it was just sort of a novelty.  They hated the experience but only because they believe there has been a significant loss of &quot;institutional knowledge&quot; about cities (for lack of a better term, I guess).  What I mean by that is this driver had no clue where to go. I think this is sort of a danger with rideshare (not that I&#x27;m arguing against it...I&#x27;m not) wherein the drivers rely overtly on the technology to guide them.  Someone visiting the city can&#x27;t get in a cab (uber) and say &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m looking for x, y, and z tonight...where can I find that?&quot; My Uncle was telling me that, as bad and dangerous as it was years ago, cab drivers were basically the resident experts of a city. They were so plugged-in to everything that they had almost a 6th sense about them. That&#x27;s been my experience with Uber in Seattle. I cannot rely on the driver to get around the city at all. My experience with Lyft has been so much better that in some cases I&#x27;d rather walk the mile back to my place than catch an uber. All of this might just be the learning curve uber has built for themselves as a direct result of the rate at which they&#x27;ve been expanding. But it&#x27;s something both companies should address.  If uber/lyft really are going to dominate urban transportation (and even inter-urban transpo....uber vegas anyone?) then they need to do more than just take me from point A to point B. They actually have to know where they&#x27;re going.",1409115505

8230890,comment,8228978,8230195,3,0,east2west,,,"I suspect money is a big motivation behind all the hand-wringing by statisticians. It is about jobs, grants, prestige. I don&#x27;t blame them; people want these things. I defintively see a competition between computer scientists and statisticians for the mantle of date scientists. When the current bubble bursts and the hype dies down, one side could have won and the world could be very different, or not. What do I know?<p>I am a little torn between realistic business demand of paying least money to get jobs done and thorough mastery and understanding of theories. Look at biostatistics; there master graduates become data analysts and process data. They know the nomenclature and can understand instructions from more advanced statisticians. The majority of practitioners don&#x27;t know proofs and they carry off their tasks reasonably well. I would call all but very select few statisticians applied statitisticans and the world is fine with that. I am not sure machine learning industry will not turn out like this, although I am not looking forward to that day.<p>I would just note that numerical optimization is a big deal in machine learning while I know of no statistical department strong in it. The popularity of SVM owes a load of gratitude to pracitical breakthrough in dynamic optimization. But if one elevates to the level of functional approximation then statistics is similar to almost all engineering fields. In fact, I suspect statisticians have more common with engineers than scientists. I bet Eric Cantor didn&#x27;t care that polling results had margins of errors but that he lost his House seat due in part to overconfidence coming from unreliable statistics.

If they came out with a phone that had specs comparable to the Flame (or slightly better) and price it competitively($175ish), both companies can do well.<p>If the 2-year development timeframe is correct, one can see how Amazon couldn&#x27;t even have thought of FFOS as an alternative, but now, FFOS is slowly but surely getting there. If Amazon uses it&#x27;s engineering chops to advance FFOS – and I am sure that a lot of developers at Amazon will be happy to contribute to FFOS too – perhaps they could compete with Android and iOS?",1409112892

My process was: Google for articles about taxi regulation, and see what percentage of them make the argument that regulation protects the underprivileged.  In my sample of 3 or 4, the answer was 0%, which seemed a clear argument against the sweeping claim that protecting the poor is &quot;the entire point of taxi regulation in the first place&quot; (note: not taxis, taxi <i>regulation</i>).<p>Furthermore, your links (or the few that I had time to investigate) do not support the central thesis that taxi <i>regulation</i> specifically protects the poor and underprivileged.  In fact, many of them are specifically contrary to your shallow analysis.<p>> Seniors, housewives, the disabled, and the poor each account for a much higher share of taxi trips than their share of the population (Rosenbloom 1985; Weiner 1982).<p>This says nothing about taxi <i>regulation</i> benefiting the poor.  And in fact much of this paper is criticizing regulation; it even cites evidence arguing that regulation <i>hurts</i> the poor (emphasis mine):<p>> Others (such as Eckert 1970, Beesley and Glaister 1983, and \nFrankena and Pautler 1986 advocate removing entry restrictions and \neliminating monopoly rents. Beesley and Glaister (1983, 611) estimated that entry and price restrictions lead to nearly $10 million per year in welfare losses in the city of London alone. <i>Embedded in those welfare measures are \nthe poor without cars, the elderly, the disabled, and others who now and \nthen need affordable door-to-door transportation services and would \nbenefit from a more competitive market.</i> They are on the wrong side of the \npolitical calculus, with their dispersed costs overlooked in a regulatory \nprocess dominated by the concentrated benefiaries (Taylor 1989).<p>> Factors Affecting the Use of Taxicaps by Lower Income Groups<p>The abstract of this paper specifically argues that the poor would benefit from reduced market entry restrictions!<p>&quot;Increased availability of taxi service by reduced market entry restrictions and reduced cost of taxi service by permitting group riding and providing subsidies would increase the mobility of the poor.&quot;<p>I have to run and don&#x27;t have time to see if any of your other evidence is any better.  But maybe you can narrow it down to a more compelling list.<p>To prove your point, you can&#x27;t just show that taxis are good for the poor, you have to show that taxi <i>regulation</i> is good.",1409112709

8230822,comment,8228978,8230292,2,0,east2west,,,"OK, to be fair, R is a reasonable language for statisticians and others. I guess R and S are different enough from usual programming languages that I may be biased against them. But I did spent five years working on bioinformatics and statistical genetics using it, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get away from it when I did. I will list my personal peeves.<p>1. R&#x27;s syntax has problems. This is well documented on the web. I recall : has wrong precedence.<p>2. My biggest problem is R&#x27;s lack of basic abstraction facility. Beyond functions there is nothing good. There are three object-oriented programming systems, none of which are simple or straightforward. It has first-class functions and lexical closure so at least basic functional programming should have been possible and fun. But R functions&#x27; have a weird parameter passing mechanism which scared me away from investigating deep. In the end I used RCPP to write large codebase and expose an R interface. And I like to delve deep into things. I was learning template metaprogramming when I was working on bioinformatics.<p>3. CRAN has way too many low quality packages, but far more importantly almost all packages&#x27; documentation consist of use-cases plus reference. To this day I don&#x27;t have a good mental picture of genomicRange (a foundational bioinformatics package in Bioconductor for NGS data analysis) data structure and how to manipulate it (one main data structure, I believe). This is annoying at best and infuriating at best.<p>4. R, more than any other language I know, is an implementation-defined language. The language reference manual frankly admits fuzzy rules for some of the more advanced features. Python, which has been recently criticised for similar problems, is clear at the basic language features level.<p>I don&#x27;t want to this discussion to degenerate into a flamewar. Programming language preference is a highly personal thing and I respect people who use R, even admire programmers who create awsome packages. ggplot2 and Plyr are some of the best packages I have ever used, and their documentation is superb. I just don&#x27;t believe R is a good language for statistical students if they hope to move on to professional programming in other languages.",1409112423

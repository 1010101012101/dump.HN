79870,comment,78933,79595,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Well, for starters, I'm from Canada, and went to a Canadian university. I dropped out in 7th grade, and in lieu of a diploma or a GED (I couldn't write one until I was 19), I wrote the SATs and took programming classes at Community College, doing well enough to convince the math department at my university to start me out in a trial period.<p>I took two classes per term in my first year, and I got A+'s. When I called up the dean of science to thank him for letting me in, I found out that he had died of a heart attack. Before passing away, however, apparently he had enrolled me full-time. From that point on I was a full, legitimate student.<p>I know several people who have gone into college with a GED, and a few others that went into college before they graduated highschool. Some were in the USA, though it was markedly fewer. Often you have to talk with the math departments to get anywhere.<p>Scholarships are quite attainable in college, but since the tuition is much cheaper in Canada it makes more of a difference. You can also win summer research studentships, and these are lucrative enough on a student budget as well. Finally you can get paid to tutor, mark assignments, and teach classes.",1195080123

All that is happening here is a discussion about when to hold ruby conferences: on weekdays so the pros can go, or on weekends so hobbyists can go.<p>I am a bit put off by the zealotry of the ruby camp (i.e. The Ruby Way, why_'s midnight genius). Ruby is an interpreter. There are lots of them. When you boil it down, there are lots with similar capabilities, so it comes down to a preference on which to choose. <p>I want a choice between interpreters, and not a choice on which cult to join.",1195078652

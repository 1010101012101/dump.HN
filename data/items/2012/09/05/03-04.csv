""Patentability"" in that sense encompasses both legal questions and factual questions. A jury can't really consider the ""patentability"" of an invention because some of the elements of ""patentability"" aren't jury questions.

I just got back from NYC, on arrival I took a yellow cab from JFK to Battery Park (far south end of Manhattan).<p>Our cab ride was during the morning rush hour and since I had the time, I was checking out google maps and other traffic info.  Looking at the route the cabby was taking, I asked him why he was going all the way up to the Williamsburg Bridge in order to get back down to Battery Park (basically hitting Midtown to have to go back downtown).  He was rather indignant and said he had been driving for 20 years.<p>He asked what direction I would take, I mentioned a few streets and one of the more southern tunnels or bridges.  After sitting in a bunch of traffic, he mentioned that I was probably right, but that going surface streets in Brooklyn isn't always popular.<p>Experience certainly means a lot, but realtime data can trump that.

One of the first things I noticed (and checked for) was that he had a TLC issued license plate - so I know he is paying his dues somewhere. One of the more interesting parts of our conversation included the fact that he owns his own vehicle and pays his own TLC fees - but at this point he only takes fares via Uber. He said it's hassle free and the people seem friendlier overall (except the one lady who rated him 1 star because there was traffic - who knew Manhattan could have traffic congestion?!)<p>I like the idea of Uber and hope they succeed in the NYC marketplace - while just a little bit more money, the experience was far better than I have ever had in a standard medallion cab, and even some of the other car services out there.",1346816606

The entire value of art is that it's an expression of an artist's point of view. Recorded art is obviously on its way out, but live or commissioned art wouldn't necessarily be, and we already know how to croudsource commissioning.<p>Academic study would certainly be another, at least in some forms.<p>Interpersonal services of various forms would also be important. These might include various forms of counseling and prostitution.<p>There would still be a market for handmade things, if only for the status involved.<p>The people who owned the capital that implemented the automation would have to find a way to tell the robots what to make and how, and would likely require assistance in doing so. There's a lot of essential, un-automatable difficulty in merely expressing requirements clearly.<p>I'm even assuming most of the actual design and engineering (post-requirements stage) can be done by computers, though I highly suspect it cannot.<p>This might seem very bleak, but consider that with all this automation around, everything would become exceedingly cheap. In the past it's only been cost-effective to make a living off of, say, music with thousands or millions of fans per individual musician. Perhaps it would be possible to make a living off an audience of hundreds or maybe less since it would cost a pittance to satisfy all your basic needs.",1346816564

If customer B learns that he paid more for the suit that his friend, customer A bought all hell breaks loose.<p>I agree he would need to be careful. But in this case because there are so many trivial ways in which he can differentiate the products in ways that will sufficiently justify price differences:<p>* Use more expensive materials. And mark it up heavily.\n* Provide a luxury service: Visit the client for measurements with a couple of pretty assistants instead of having them come to you, and make the service look more upscale. Send someone over with samples and pictures to get feedback a couple more times than usual. \n* Make things take <i>longer</i> to give the impression of more effort. There's a shoemaker in London that takes 6 months to produce your pair of shoes. They can optionally provide additional pairs to the same measurements, for a measly additional sum of 500 pounds per pair - the price for their first pair is not listed. I'm sure there are more - that's just one I stumbled over. But this one presents the long time it takes as a mark of quality and status: Most people just go to a store and buy shoes, but <i>you</i>, your shoes take <i>6 months</i> to be ready. Of course it costs.\n* Add on lots of stuff that indicate higher quality but that the client has no idea of the real cost/effort for: Finer stiching; more complicated patterns; more detailing inside. etc.<p>As you point out, he could also charge extra for faster delivery (on top of making his new ""premium"" service take longer by default, even), or flat out state that due to the demand, there is a waiting list, but a limited number of ""rush"" order will be processed if you pay a substantial premium.<p>This is very different from most technology products - suits, or fashion in general, is a very visible status symbol, and beyond a certain quality level, a higher price will often make the product more desirable even when there are no quality differences other than minor visible visual cues that lets those in the know realize that you've paid twice as much.",1346816477

The point is really people's idea of dressing has changed. There were times when costly clothing automatically meant something. Those days are gone. I find it difficult to imagine, people wearing suits to work these days. Most of them look like 'Odd ones out'.<p>I don't like to wear a suit, nor does anybody around me unless they are getting married or they are about to meet somebody powerful and rich. There fore clothing industry is 'optimized for the common case'. The only clothing I find worth buying these days is rugged jeans and polo T-shirts. Anything else and I find that to be focusing on ornament more than the substance. Therefore the demand and supply moves in that direction.<p>The place for bespoke suits today is the distinction that tailored clothing carries.

I honestly don't see the need here - Uber's availability in NYC is decent... could be improved, certainly, but there are well more than enough gypsy cabs/car services around to tap into, it seems.<p>The NYC medallion system is one of the few that I think works well. Unlike in other cities, the rules that Uber would potentially be violating are those which <i>only</i> affect medallion cabs, and explicitly exclude car services like Uber. (The intent is to have the medallion cabs resemble a 'public' transportation system more, in that they cannot refuse service to anywhere within the boroughs, cannot refuse passengers etc.), while the private cab companies can do whatever they damn well please, more or less.<p>I'm not sure what Uber has to gain by doing this - it's a hefty risk, especially since the forces they're probably up against here in New York are very powerful and very well-funded, and the laws are already rather lenient - they've been able to establish a successful business already without pushing the envelope.",1346814858

Calling them ""genes"" is confusing because genes typically refer to smaller hereditary units (generally an individual bit on the chromosome). It would also be helpful if you mentioned that what you call ""mating"" is usually called ""crossover"".<p>Also this bit is rather inaccurate in terms of theory:<p>>Mating alone has a little bit of a problem: in-breeding. If all you do is mate your candidates to go from generation to generation, you run the risk of getting stuck near a local optimum: an answer thats pretty good but not necessarily the global optimum (the best you can hope for).<p>You're sort of looking at all of GA backwards here. Mutation is the main way that a GA arrives at new innovations, and an algorithm with no crossover will do usually pretty well, but will be prone to getting stuck in local optima. This is because it is possible to arrive at a solution where no incremental change can improve the fitness.<p>Crossover is somewhat helpful against local optima because it allows the algorithm to try combinations of innovations from different solutions. Depending on the fitness landscape, this can be either helpful or useless. Regardless, a GA will, on any non-trivial problem, almost certainly get stuck on a local optimum, which is a very important point for users of GAs to realize.<p>But what is <i>not</i> the case is that mutation prevents crossover from hitting a local optimum. Crossover by itself basically just won't optimize at all. It's generally best to think of a GA as being driven primarily by mutation and selection, with crossover as a tweak that can make the search more efficient.",1346814486

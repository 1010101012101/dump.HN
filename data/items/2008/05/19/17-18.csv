194269,comment,193597,193781,0,0,LPTS,,,"I really think you are wrong about google being a great job where people can easily be fulfilled.<p>But, I sure agree with you about corporations doing a lot of good for the world.  Corporations are great.<p>The problem with corporations is in a combination of the shitty supreme court ruling that gives them all the rights of people, and the laws that say (unlike people) there only obligation is to maximize shareholder value.  A lot of corporate abuse comes from them having all the legal rights of personhood but none of the moral responsibilities or ethics that come with personhood.  We need corporations, but they should only get the rights of personhood if they agree to the ethical and moral responsibilities of personhood too.  The problem isn't with corporations in and of themselves, it's this shitty legal context they exist in.<p>The other problem with corporations is that they can pass off costs to the public.  For example, the true cost of oil includes the environmental damage from burning hydrocarbons, but this doesn't show up on the balance sheet.  Or, if you prefer, the costs of bottling pepsi include water rights issues, yet bottlers often don't have to pay market price for this access, and may continue to get heavily subsidized water during a drought.<p>If these two problems were solved, corporations would be a lot better.  I think people who attribute the problems corporations are confused and the problem is really a subtler issue around the particular way we allow corporations to selectively get the benefits of citizenship without the responsibilities, and to pass off costs like environmental, opportunity, and subsidies.",1211219507
194268,comment,193597,194215,0,0,gojomo,,,"I thought it might be a word-choice and cultural issue; I suspect in Europe 'noble' has different connotations because there are actual aristocracy doing things, occasionally altruistically. (Americans mainly think of aristocracy as a source of camp entertainment.) I meant 'noble' as 'deservedly outstanding; moral; admirable; honorable; generous'.<p>The journalists working for profit-making papers I have met do believe their work a noble calling, even when they feel cynical or compromised by the economic realities of their market.

If you run a standard Linux or Windows, any interface text or icons at the default size will be so small as to be illegible.  If you crank up the interface DPI to an appropriate size, however, then you lose a lot of screen real estate to menus, toolbars, and statusbars -- something we take for granted now that we have 20-inch displays (just try using Word in a 640x480 window).<p>What the XO really needs is an interface like a kiosk or mobile device: something easy-to-use that aggressively conserves screen real estate.  Sugar fills this role pretty well... the default installs of Linux or XP do not.  Windows CE would have been a better choice than XP in this respect (and others), but it would presumably have been more work for Microsoft with less payoff, since CE has relatively few educational activities and doesn't run the ""real"" version of Office.",1211218145

I'm not saying static typing is bad or good I'm just saying that type checking itself is NEARLY USELESS unless you include some sort of validation.<p><pre><code>		Query q = new Query(""select * from users where id = (id)"");\n		QueryParam qp = new QueryParam(""(id)"",25);\n		q.addParam(qp);\n		ResultSet rs = q.execute();\n		public class Query {\n			public ResultSet execute() {\n			for(QueryParam qp : this.getQueryParams()) { \n				this.getSql().replace(qp.getId(),qp.getValue());\n			}\n			super.execute(sql);\n			}\n		}</code></pre>\nThat's all type safe.

Cue the Droid advertising campaign, which let people know there was a smartphone on Verizon that did pretty much everything the iPhone did for a bit cheaper.

4137553,comment,4136752,4137373,2,0,soc88,,,"Yes, I'm full aware of that. I'm not claiming that it tells us the complete and final truth, just that it is an interesting data point.<p>In my experience a lot of those ""I programmed 15 years in Java, get off my lawn"" senior developers get angry about Scala. This is interesting, because it isn't that way for other languages running on the JVM like Clojure, JRuby or Groovy.<p>It is only a speculation why it is like that, but in my opinion it is because alternatives like Groovy, JRuby, Clojure are considered to be some sort of ""supplemental"" or ""add-on"" languages by those people, while Scala is seen as full-scale alternative to Java (not in the sense that it will replace Java, but in the sense of ""I can write 100% of my application in this language without dropping down to Java for the performance critical parts"").<p>I think it is interesting how different the reaction is compared to C# <> F#, for instance. Is it because Java and C# developers come from different backgrounds? Because F# is ""made by Microsoft"", while Scala is not ""made by Oracle""? Is it because Java developers were happy with Sun telling them that they wouldn't need all those ""fancy"" features of the .NET languages? I think this would be interesting to discuss further, although I think it is hard to come up with valid data points.<p>From my experience, most of the claims about ""complexity"" and ""too hard for beginners"" come not from people learning the language, but from people with > 5 years of Java experience _not_ wanting to learn another language.<p>I'm quite ambivalent about the syntactic flexibility. On the one hand, they cut it down for 2.10, but on the other I think it is a superficial measurement. There are a lot of languages with more flexibility and a lot of languages with less, both seem to be alive and well.

The official 'Programming OpenGL ES 2.0' book even shows you how to do most of it, with example code included.<p>What jwz fails to recognize is that OpenGL ES does not only have to run on iPads, iPhones or other relatively high-powered mobile devices, but also on extremely low-powered devices with really small memory sizes (RAM and ROM) where every byte (code or data) counts. Compared to mobile devices at the time the first OpenGL ES API's were designed, an iPad could almost be considered a supercomputer. For OpenGL ES, small API size was one of the design constraints, simple as that.<p>Last but not least, OpenGL ES was supposed to become the industry standard for mobile 3D graphics, which means it needed strong industry support. Stuffing the API with loads of crap that almost nobody would use would drive up implementation costs for no good reason. Programmable shaders are called 'programmable' for a reason, if you want to do very specific stuff with them (such as emulating the fixed-function OpenGL pipeline), there is nothing preventing you to do so.<p>The single point I can kind of agree with is that maybe they should not have used 'OpenGL' in the name of the API, because it suggest at least some form of compatibility with previous OpenGL versions.

My theory is that the continuous overloading of iTunes with a wide range of functionalities is creating a mess.  What makes sense for music files doesn't necessarily make sense for videos, books or apps.<p>Searching the iTunes store is horrible, particularly on an iPad or iPhone.  More often than not it is easier to use Google on a browser to search the iTunes store.<p>Importing content into iTunes is equally fraught with issues.  I had to import a library of hundreds of music CDs from Windows Media.  Thousands of songs.  iTunes refused to maintain the grouping of songs per album (as they show-up in Windows Media) and required manually editing and sorting of thousands of songs in order to clean-up the mess.  I understand that it has to do with metadata issues, but if MS can do it iTunes ought to be far more intelligent and do it right and offer to auto-magically fix the issues during import.<p>This is very similar to what happened with XCode 4.  Before XC4 browsing documentation was a good experience.  Now they chose to overload the iTunes-ish Organizer with all manner of things, including documentation.  Now browsing the docs is ugly and difficult.  It sucks.<p>What I'd like to see is for iTunes to return to being the best app for managing your music while new specialized apps are introduced to manage your iPhone and other content.",1340207185

The pile of tests you write if you're in Python or Perl mostly translate to Haskell unscathed, in that each individual test still is testing something (""is the href attribute on <a> encoded properly? is the name attribute on <a> encoded properly? ...""), yet considered as a whole the tests have significant redundancy with the type system, because if you set the types up correctly there's a great deal fewer possible ways to screw up than there used to be.",1340206822

As a Chinese major in the 1970s, my typical class size for in-major courses shrank down to three or four students total by the third year of the program. (First-year Chinese had fifty students in three sections in those days; second-year had fifteen in one section.) One of the great things about huge brick-and-mortar state universities over the last century has been having a large enough critical mass of students to offer rarely sought courses like Chinese (in those days) or Attic Greek or Classical Nahuatl (any day) or other courses that my friends took while enrolled. Harvard has enough sheer money from its endowment to offer Sanskrit or other rarely studied courses<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4137186&whence=item%3fid%3d4136069"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4137186&whence=item...</a><p>even if those courses gain very low enrollments. Most other universities subsidize limited enrollments in rare courses with high enrollments in the commonplace courses.<p>The great thing about more and more university-level courses going online is that eventually there should be a niche for university-level courses delivered online on almost any subject that has ever been treated in a university-level course. That will allow, I hope, curious learners to shop around and figure out which general statistics course (a HUGE enrollment course) and which Aramaic course (a course with tiny enrollment in the best of times) offers the most return of learning for the investment of time, effort, and some amount of money to take the course.<p>I think many brick-and-mortar universities, and perhaps approximately one state ""flagship"" university per state, will still be able to survive the onslaught of competition from online courses for a while because of prior claims to credentialing students and the advantage of in-person interaction with other students (and with some less introverted instructors). But further diversity of provision of courses allows each provider to specialize in what it does best, and should make learning more efficient (in the economist's sense of ""efficient"") for everyone.<p>P.S. The walk back and forth across the Mississippi River on the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus was always pleasant to me. I liked seeing the university rowing team practicing in the river and the signs of the changes of seasons as I looked upstream and downstream along the riverbanks.<p>AFTER EDIT, responding to a point in another comment:<p>Yes, independent test centers with good test security will help online credentials gain acceptance, and Udacity has already anticipated this problem. Udacity has announced in a blog post, ""Udacity in partnership with Pearson VUE announces testing centers,""<p><a href=""http://udacity.blogspot.com/2012/06/udacity-in-partnership-with-pearson-vue.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://udacity.blogspot.com/2012/06/udacity-in-partnership-w...</a><p>a partnership ""to make our classes count towards a credential that is recognized by employers."" So this is an example of unbundling the package that is currently offered by degree-granting universities. The universities both teach courses and administer tests, and claim therefore to offer credentials that can be trusted. But one group of organizations could offer a wide selection of courses, while another group of organizations offers a wide selection of credentialing tests, and I expect that to be the wave of the future.",1340206579

A good anatomy book is your best bet, but this is a decent start:  <a href=""http://www.dcfirst.com/muscle_anatomy_posters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dcfirst.com/muscle_anatomy_posters.html</a><p>Your spine is a stack of disks.  It's got no inherent tendency to stay upright, other than the forces imposed on it by your muscles (and fascia, but that's a passive stabilization system).  In particular the spinal erectors, iliocostalis lumborum, spinalis, longissimus thoracis, levatores costarum/breves, and cervical muscles.<p>With low bodyweight, you've got low muscle mass, particularly if you're not doing much in the way of strength training.  As you age, you're losing this at the rate of about 0.5 - 1% per year (past age 30 or so).  Which is where strength training comes into play.<p><i>Muscle tissue and strength are developed in direct response to imposed demand</i>.  It's called the ""specificity"" or ""SAID"" (specific adaptation to imposed demand) principle.<p>Full-body strength training routines -- squats, deadlifts, lunges, press, bench, and rowing / chin-up movements -- will develop that muscle.<p>At 6'2"", last time I weighed 130# was some time in middle school.  By high school, as a swimmer and just doing bodyweight strength training, I was 185-195#.  These days I'm at about 260, cut weight would be closer to 235-245# with 8-10% bodyfat.  I'm not saying that this should be your goal, but am pointing out that there's a <i>huge</i> variance in individual <i>fit</i> body mass.  Your weight might be appropriate for a long-distance marathoner (Geoffrey Muttai, among the best in the world, is about 125# at 6' in competitive shape, but that's absolutely shredded with <6% bodyfat).<p>Here's my suggestion:  try strength training for 6-12 months.  See if it changes your perceived fitness and comfort.  Like it?  Keep it up.  Don't?  You've gained experience points and it's cost you little else.  I'm a fan of <i>The New Rules of Lifting</i> (which describes much of the science and health/fitness benefits in much greater depth) and <i>Starting Strength</i> (a simpler and very brutally effective lifting program) myself.<p>Oh, and when you get into your 40s like me, you may appreciate that muscle mass.<p>Just sayin'.",1340206135

This is partly because of Scala, but also because of the libraries I'm using. Currently I'm using DropWizard for the development of web services, which is just a thin wrapper around Jetty + JAX-RS.

There was no point in having the 100th ranked dept of tropical medicine when students could go somewhere else to learn that and you could use the money to support the worlds top dept in some other topic",1340204624

More likely management just doesn't understand how to properly value their actual role, which may not be reflected by their job title. In that case, instead of firing them, it might be better to either:<p>A. understand the actual value they deliver and leave well enough alone<p>or<p>B. create a new title for them, which reflects the value they produce and then hire somebody else for their old position.",1340204524

But it isn't a perfectly acceptable Query, and you can't pass a String to the database, only a Query.  In order to turn a String into a Query, it has to be passed to a function that escapes problem characters safely.  You need to use such a function regardless of dynamic vs static typing, but static typing enforces that you always use that function, and can't forget and accidently submit an unescaped string to the database.",1340204512

I get this ""cool stuff that I don't get to do at work"" idea, but I think it's vitally important to have side projects that have a different gratification profile than one's main work. If you work as a developer of any kind, most work will be on massive projects spanning at least months, often years. For a side project to be fun, I think its important to have a different pace. For example trying out a new technology and doing some cool hack quickly, in a few hours, rather than ""doing it right"" slowly and meticulously. Maybe side projects should be mainly about learning or trying out things rather than doing things, exploration not exploitation of existing skills.",1340204456

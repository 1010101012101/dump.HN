That which initially begins as a uniform definition (human beings, mammals, things that have consciousness, individuals, individual life) is then examined for &#x27;properties&#x27;, in which a collection of &#x27;properties&#x27; define not only a label, but implicitly defined, correlative associations to that label (cultural assumptions).<p>I think that society might eventually find itself moving past linguistic categorization to process absolute information about reality, if the computational calculation of lots and lots of data about the individual becomes so individually defined, so complex, and so multidimensional, that words can not express meaningful information - both generally and specifically, because it is derived from abstracted  layers of object data points [data] and the abstract relations that structure and organize them [composition of theory].<p>Generally speaking, we need the ability to compose correlations from data in order to infer information about day to day things. This is generally called common sense, or rational knowledge. Sometimes it&#x27;s wrong. Sometimes it&#x27;s totally irrational. As a ---, I don&#x27;t see the point in companies pointing out how diverse they are. All I care about is how much I&#x27;m going to learn about code, math, and computer science. I want the assurance that I will be treated equally. Otherwise, it&#x27;s like trying to get a pendulum to stop swinging by pushing it equally hard, the opposing way.",1414781976

8540463,comment,8537951,8537951,0,0,bigtunacan,,,"Sony makes and has been making for quite some time some pretty impressive hardware, not just in mobile, but across a wide range of devices.  There has to be some great technical/engineering talent there, but at the same time there seems to be a problem with management.  Poor marketing and bad strategic decisions all over the place.<p>They&#x27;ve had bad marketing behind their phones for ages.  I doubt many people remember the Sony P800 or P900 phones (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_P900"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_P900</a>) I had one of these back when most people were buying Nokia Series 40 devices.  Back then the P800 was an incredible piece of hardware leaps and bounds beyond the competition, but no one even knew it existed.<p>Fast forward to more current times and look at the flop that is the Sony PS Vita.  This is a great technical master piece as far as a dedicated handheld gaming device is concerned.  But Sony threw in the towel early and won&#x27;t push any AAA titles to the device.  They have essentially said it is a &quot;niche&quot; product supported by indie games that has to compete with phones.  Sony&#x27;s top brass is convinced there is no longer a market for dedicated game handhelds; somebody better notify Nintendo.  The 3DS has outsold the Vita by 36 million+ units despite being by far the inferior technical choice (don&#x27;t take this as some sort of anti-Nintendo fanboy thing; I own both devices) when we compare the two devices based on technical specifications rather than libraries the PS Vita is the clear winner.  This points to bad management and bad marketing.<p>Some of Sony&#x27;s technical decisions have to be pushed down from on high as well; things like only supporting their proprietary overpriced memory sticks rather than standard SD or microSD is a greedy management driven practices that actively creates hostility and erodes customer loyalties.",1414781816

8540453,comment,8537390,8539592,0,0,mcguire,,,"I read this story[1] once, although I don&#x27;t remember where:<p>Someone somewhere needed a large number of cargo vessels built quickly (think WWII liberty ships, but those weren&#x27;t made of wood), so they brought in a bunch of cabinet makers to bolster their shipwrights. It worked great, until the ships built by normal woodworkers saw significant wave action, at which time they broke up and sank. The punchline being that, on land, rigidity is the primary constraint; if you build it not to be floppy, it will be plenty strong. At sea (and especially in aerospace), strength is primary; if you build it to be rigid, it will be too heavy and if you build it to be not-heavy, it will probably fall apart.<p>An amateur can build a fairly large boat (although usually to plans by an actual naval architect), and a small boat can make it across an ocean, but if you&#x27;re serious about schlepping things around, the design constraints for ships aren&#x27;t much looser than those in aerospace.<p>[1] Maybe this, although that&#x27;s not the cover I remember: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Structures-Things-Dont-Fall-Down/dp/0306812835/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1414781193&sr=1-1&keywords=structures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Structures-Things-Dont-Fall-Down/dp/03...</a>",1414781748

8540450,comment,8539917,8540103,0,0,candybar,,,"Only unpopular or unscalable software projects are done in a few months.  What you&#x27;re describing is already the norm for custom internal software or other categories of software that aren&#x27;t necessarily designed to scale beyond a specific purpose.  This kind of work is often outsourced to contractors who are hired for months.  But the reason that these projects have a definite time horizon is because they are seen as the cost of doing business, not a core revenue generator.<p>Successful, scalable, revenue-generating software projects that compete in a big market, on the other hand, are never finished.  Microsoft still has top engineers working on Excel and Windows.  Google almost certainly has some of their best people incrementally improving Search and Maps and Gmail.  Many of Amazon&#x27;s top engineers are working on improving AWS.  Apple&#x27;s certainly not transferring their best engineers off iOS.<p>The economics of software competition is such that making even a very small improvement to a successful software project that scales to millions of users can be worth billions of dollars, while creating entirely from scratch something that is half as good as another extremely valuable software project can be worth close to nothing.  This means an extremely large number of top engineers are going to be working on incremental improvements to successful products purely as a matter of economic necessity.<p>Also, the idea that top-level engineers should constantly move to new projects is superficially alluring because new projects are supposed to be fun and challenging and the best people should be rewarded with fun and challenging tasks, but in the real world, engineering is mostly about constraints.  From a product standpoint, coming up with a new product is challenging, but from a software engineering standpoint, greenfield development is not very challenging because there are so few constraints that make engineering difficult.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d also add that in companies that specialize in the type of projects I described in the first paragraph, what you&#x27;re advocating is pretty much what happens - the best developers in non-product companies often become architects and managers who get to make technology choices, talk to clients, produce specs and/or working prototypes, while their less-talented, lower-ranking peers are left to deal with the details and implementation issues.  When quality isn&#x27;t important, this is efficient.<p>Edit2: I think part of the reason why people get the impression you do is that most people&#x27;s greenfield projects are disproportionately fun hobbyist projects where they get to be the sole guy in charge, whereas most people&#x27;s non-greenfield projects are disproportionately corporate projects where they are subordinate to the wishes of many others, including other developers, managers, product people, customers, designers, etc.",1414781679

Not just for the family and friends of the poor guy who died, but for commercial manned spaceflight in general.<p>SpaceshipTwo is considered the &#x27;simplest&#x27; and &#x27;safest&#x27; of all the upcoming manned commercial vehicle. It has many features that should help keep it reliable. For example, instead of a real liquid rocket engine, it uses a hybrid engine; it has almost no moving parts apart from a valve or two. No turbopumps or gimbals or much mechanical stuff to go wrong. It only goes suborbital, so it does not need a heatshield because there&#x27;s no re-entry. The landing system uses wings & wheels similar to any commercial jet. This stuff is mature and tested.<p>In fact, the only novel thing about SS2 is it&#x27;s wing-feathering system. It&#x27;s lets the craft to descend vertically still under the pilots control. I wonder if (and this is complete speculation) there was a problem restoring the wings to their &#x27;atmospheric&#x27; flight position which prevented them from landing normally.<p>The consequences for commercial manned spaceflight will be quite severe, I think. I imagine that many Virgin Galactic customers will cancel their pre-orders. The flight test program is dead in it&#x27;s tracks at this point; even those who don&#x27;t cancel will be unlikely to fly for many more years while investigations and improvements are concluded.\nOther manned providers such as SpaceX and XCor will likely be extra cautious before allowing people to fly in their vehicles.<p>The image of manned commercial spaceflight will take a hit. If the &#x27;Safest&#x27; of the commercial vehicles can crash before it even enters service, I worry that many potential customers will be put off. It never hurts to remember that Spaceflight is a dangerous business.<p>It&#x27;s a sad day to top off a bad week in spaceflight. :(",1414781547

Honest to God, I am here to tell you that it is stranger than that. Metaprogramming began with taking drugs in the company of dolphins.&quot;<p>&quot;We learn. But first we learn to learn. We setup programming in our mind which is the pathway to further programming. (Lilly is largely talking about programming the brain and the nervous system, which he collectively called the biocomputer.)\nLilly’s metaprogramming was more about feeding yourself imagery, reinventing yourself, all that. This sort of thinking links directly to folks out there who dabble in shamanism, wave their hands over tarot cards and wake up early for karate class. I guess you could say metaprogramming is New Age, but it’s all settled down recently into a sleeping bag with plain old nerdiness. (If you got here from a Google search for “C++ Metaprogramming”, stick around, but I only ask that you burn those neural pathways that originally invoked the search. Many thanks.)&quot;<p>For sure mushrooms and psylocybin are unsuitable for programming, but low doses of cocaine, acid or 2C-* might have their value.

Probably they are less applicable the less research or speculative work you do.<p>Now for the matter of drive. You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode&#x27;s office and said, ``How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?&#x27;&#x27; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, ``You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.&#x27;&#x27; I simply slunk out of the office!<p>What Bode was saying was this: ``Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.&#x27;&#x27; Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don&#x27;t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode&#x27;s remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done. I don&#x27;t like to say it in front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.

For example if you use the last byte of the IP address, and some network administrator decides to give each host an IPv6 net, the last byte of the IP might very well be one for each host.

In order to provide basic rigor to the science (and to provide any hope of ending the current replication crisis) there needs to be scientists employing the same methods but who expect radically different (socially conservative) outcomes. Currently the best way to see which method or explanation a psychology study finds evidence for is not to read the study, but rather to read the bio of the first author, and find his or her pet theory. This is the problem at hand. The lack of intellectual diversity in the discipline just allows the intellectual farce to plod along unexposed.",1414779091

It is based on the contradiction between public and private life, between universal and particular interests. For this reason, the state must confine itself to formal, negative activities, since the scope of its own power comes to an end at the very point where civil life and work begin. Indeed, when we consider the consequences arising from the asocial nature of civil life, of private property, of trade, of industry, of the mutual plundering that goes on between the various groups in civil life, it becomes clear that the law of nature governing the administration is impotence. For, the fragmentation, the depravity, and the slavery of civil society is the natural foundation of the modern state, just as the civil society of slavery was the natural foundation of the state in antiquity. The existence of the state is inseparable from the existence of slavery.</i>",1414778941

You mean just generally behaving badly, like spitting on puppies and cussing at nuns? Why you need to call taxi commission about it? If he&#x27;s doing something illegal or disturbing the peace, call the police. If not, why you need to call anybody at all?<p>>>> Because it turns out private cars use public roads, ones other humans also have to get around on.<p>In other words, you like to control people around you, and not having everybody wear a number and a phone that you can use to tell on them disturbs you. I find that sentiment hard to sympathize with, sorry. People sometimes do behave badly, but they have no obligation to provide you with a phone number to tell on them.<p>>>> But that plus the fundamentalist libertarian idiocy<p>And here we are back to name calling.

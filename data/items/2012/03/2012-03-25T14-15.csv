3752738,comment,3751225,3751225,2,0,bloblaw,,,"This looks like a good introduction to the core of Perl programming, however I would recommend ""Modern Perl"" by Chromatic. It's free (and legal) for the PDF version.<p>Why do I recommend ""Modern Perl"" instead? Because it: 
(1) contains new language features added to Perl in the last 9 years 
(2) covers how to use Moose for OOP 
(3) shows how to use new Perl 6 features in Perl 5
(4) clearly explains the <i>right</i> way to do things
(5) covers how to write tests
(6) demonstrates that the Perl language continues to evolve and is a modern and effective programming language<p>And in the end, ""Modern Perl"" shows you how to write maintainable and effective Perl code.

Less technical, there is practically no infinite search space, even if theoretically there is - memory of a physical computer can only count up to a certain number, even if very large.<p>The halting problem, or undecidability in general is the application of a very basic intuition. If I give you infinite space, and ask you to find me a certain something in that space, there is no way I can be sure whether or not you will succeed. Diophantine equations for example, to solve them requires you to search infinitely through the complex plane, and is analogous to the halting problem.<p>Now in which sense of the word 'solve' could you possibly believe these can be solved? Yes - our problems and machines are finite, so in that sense maybe.",1332686696

Not necessarily because they're the best metric, but because they're one more metric you can use to filter against when you have a vast pool of candidates. Of course, any decent engineer is unlikely to be competing against a 'vast pool of candidates' right now, because the competition for talent is so fierce.

3752680,comment,3751767,3752441,1,0,tokenadult,,,"I appreciate your thoughtful comments, droithomme, on many of the HN threads on education reform. You are correct that the statistical model used by the newspaper report needs more validation. On the other hand, as the story relates, the model is a generalization of a model developed during reporting by the same newspaper about known cheating incidents that could be independently verified by other means, including witness reports of overt conduct that breached test security or altered student-submitted answers after the test booklets were submitted to teachers or school principals. The earlier reporting by the same newspaper revealed that sometimes agreements (""conspiracies"") to cheat on tests were rather widespread in entire schools or even entire school districts, and stayed secret for a time (at least) because all the school officials involved were united in having an interest in presenting fake test scores.<p>I think that the scores bouncing up but then back down is, again, an empirical observation from the known cases of cheating in the area the newspaper reported on most closely a few years ago. As the submitted article here suggests, it is certainly notionally possible that a group of students might spurt forward suddenly in academic performance if they enjoy the instruction of a particularly good teacher. But, if genuine learning had taken place, it is notionally much harder to find the same group of students fall back the next year to a level lower than the level they reached the previous school year. It is much more likely that students might progress in grades from a teacher who is eager to look good, even if it means cheating, to a teacher who is not in on the cheating plot, or who at least is less effective at cheating in a manner that massively boosts scores.<p>I think some of the other claims that you suggest would be made by the newspaper, if the statistical model were definitely backed up by other evidence of cheating, could be made if journalists in the various localities involved look for other sources of information.

""Download this webpage and call ME with the results"".  A callback in Erlang is some functionality in a service a process provides.  You call a callback to perform some task then it gives it back to you, possibly synchronously in the case of gen_server:call.  Using a function in the Twisted/Node style would not make sense since a process is the fundamental unit of concurrency in Erlang so message passing is the only way to communicate back and forth.  It would simply make no sense to ask a service in Erlang to ""call THIS function when you're done"" in most cases.  The function would run in the wrong process and this isn't how you construct Erlang code.  The semantics are completely different.  A callback in Erlang is much closer to a webservices, for example, where you ask for some work to be done and it gives you the result.  As far as I know, Gevent does not use the 'callback' terminology for anything.  If you want to redefine ""callback"" to be ""any method to communicate between two piece of code"" then you're free to, but we aren't talking about the same thing then and nobody else will know what you're talking about.",1332685339

The select operator seems like it would solve the problem your implying.<p>> then suddenly I can't easily argue anymore about the order of message arrival and what effect that has on shared state<p>You can barely, sometimes not even, reason about the order of message arrival and it's effect on state in callbacks, though.  At every point in a callback you have the entire state of the program to deal with, at least in Erlang or Go you only have the context of your local process/goroutine to deal with.  I have seen plenty of callback code explode because, what seemed like, an obvious sequence of events got reorderd or sent before the previous work was expected to be done, or any variation, and the code didn't handle it properly.  You might be thinking ""well, duh, that is easy to fix and a silly mistake to make"", but it isn't.  In a shared memory, especially where mutability is the default mode of action, an event-driven framework can be represented as a function that takes a 2 dimensional matrix: 1 dimension is every variable in my program, the other is every event that can happen in my program.  At every point in the program any variation of this matrix must be a valid state.  In a language like Go, or Erlang, I can cut this matrix down significantly so that I only have to worry about the matrix involving some subset of events and some subset of variables.  In short, that's a massive win IMO.",1332684095

Obviously the brain computes stuff, but we tend to be rather specific and we think of computers when we say computing device, which might or might not be able to simulate human intelligence, hence the strong vs weak AI debate.<p>Trivially you can, with perfect information and sufficient technology, modelling neuron by neuron, create an electronic brain. The catch is, you would only prove humanOS runs on silicon as well as it does on carbon.<p>Having a powerful enough computing device does not imply it can compute anything a different type of computing device can. We have the turing-completeness that indeed says this is valid for a subset of our current programming languages and hardware, but turing-completeness does not trivially apply to our brain.<p>As an analogy, a ruler is a drawing device, but you can't draw a circle with it as with a compass. You can somewhat simulate drawing a circle by taking it very slowly using a certain clever algorithm, but it will never be perfect or else require infinite or virtually infinite time/space to do so.",1332684067

Personally, I didn't think that was the best part of the OpEd. Leaving Mr. Curtis out, let's compare Gruber to me. I pontificate on programming. Whether explicitly or by implictaion, I hold myself as having some authority on the subject by virtue of experience.<p>Looking at my track record... Hmmm... We are not talking about someone who invented anything significant. People can rightly take me to task for having an imbalance between my doing and my telling.<p>What about Gruber in comparison? He takes a lot of people to task for criticizing Apple. He's mostly a gadfly. He serves up ""claim chowder."" He talks about he industry in broad terms. But does he hold himself out as an expert? I don't think so.<p>In that, there is all the difference. Having an opinion and telling people your opinion without claiming you back your opinion with experience and/or expertise is always fine. Gruber is a reporter of sorts, a journalist. He reports what he sees and how he sees it, which is different than offring people advice on what to do from the presumed position of being an auhority.<p>I don't ask what Gruber has done, because he doesn't tell me how to interview programmers, or whether Ruby is a better language than CoffeeScript, or why funcional programming is a waste of time.<p>JM2C.",1332684033

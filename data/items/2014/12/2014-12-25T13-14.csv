I was just trying to refute the basic idea that lots of people make when they state that we&#x27;ll pay for the Basic Income program by re-allocating all the funding that is currently used for social services and use it for basic income payments. My point is that you can&#x27;t do this. You&#x27;ll still need a large &quot;safety net&quot; and associated government organization for reasons stated above and more.",1419515991

8796243,comment,8795945,8796200,0,0,berdario,,,"(I&#x27;ll try to keep this short, since I feel this is quite offtopic, if we want to discuss this further I suppose we could find a better venue... maybe even email?)<p>I assume that with &quot;Ruby 1.9 solution&quot;, you refer to the fact that Ruby source code is by default evaluated as UTF-8, right?<p>That&#x27;s definitely a good thing, but with Python3 that wasn&#x27;t the only change brought into the language.<p>I said &quot;if Ruby ever decides to fix&quot;, because the need for a change is not obvious and not universally accepted: it&#x27;s basically the same issue as automatic type coercion (aka weak/strong typing) and early (or late) raise/throw/handling of exception.<p>Basically: In Python2 and Ruby you have one or two String types (runtime types, in this discussion I only care about them), with the Ruby Strings tagged with the encoding internally used. In python the types are just &quot;anything goes&quot; (binary strings, the old Python2 string) and unicode (the actual internal encoding is an implementation detail).<p>The problem (if you agree that it is one) is that you can easily mix-and-match them, and everything will work fine only as long as the operation makes sense. When it won&#x27;t anymore you&#x27;ll get an exception.<p>This is a problem when you don&#x27;t completely control the type/encoding of your input (e.g. if you have an HTTP request and your string depends on the type/charset specified in the Content-Type).<p>A dumb example of what could happen:<p><pre><code>    a = &quot;Ё&quot;.force_encoding &quot;ISO-8859-5&quot;
    a2 = &quot;®&quot;.force_encoding &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;
    # a + a2 will fail with Encoding::CompatibilityError
</code></pre>
A similar thing can happen in Python2. While Python3 will reject the same operation as soon as the types get in contact with each other (still at runtime, but it&#x27;ll be like doing `1+&quot;1&quot;` in Python or Ruby: you&#x27;ll spot it right away).<p>I wrote a quite lengthy blog post about this change in Python3, but I haven&#x27;t translated it in English yet, if there&#x27;s some interest I could try to do it a bit sooner.<p>Anyhow, I don&#x27;t want to create a flame or anything like that. I just wanted to explain why the Python3 choice has been made, and why a destructive change might have had its merit.
While I prefer the Python3&#x27;s approach, and I&#x27;m definitely not a Ruby developer, I still appreciate these updates to Ruby: for example I actually touched first hand the internal encoding-handling code of Ruby (Rubinius) some time ago with a friend of mine: <a href=""http://git.io/7kM4Gw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.io/7kM4Gw</a> and I can benefit from the new GC code in new rubies, which makes metasploit 4 times faster to load.",1419515889

8796173,comment,8794695,8795225,0,0,heynk,,,"I backed the indiegogo campaign with hopes that Muse would be very hacker friendly, but so far their SDK support is limited. They provide very low level interfaces for interacting with the data over bluetooth, but are behind scheduling on releasing their &#x27;LibMuse&#x27; which promises to be a higher level SDK (in multiple languages) to help people build apps. I don&#x27;t have links right now but after browsing their forums they seem to have de-prioritized their developer tools in favor of their own in-house apps. This is disappointing both as a developer who&#x27;d like to harness my Muse and as a consumer who wants to be able to do more things with my Muse than their single Calm app [1]<p>[1] <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/muse-calm/id849841170?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/muse-calm/id849841170?mt=8</a>",1419512438

If you&#x27;re optimising at that level then fine, I&#x27;d do it (with Boost Intrusive). Otherwise I&#x27;d pick up Boost Multi_Index with a couple of &#x27;sequenced&#x27; (linked node) or random_access (vector of pointers) indices. This is non-intrusive and has the construction and overhead you want.<p>I just wanted to spell out that in most use cases intrusion is a sucky trade-off with no benefit.",1419512426

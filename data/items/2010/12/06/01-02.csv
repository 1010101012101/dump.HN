What does matter is that the doctor's a fellow at a reputable institution.

If your doctor doesn't, I'd be wary about his diagnosis for anything other than a common cold.<p>This is the reality (and also what the article points to). Doctors who don't keep up are the sheep, the same as programmers that learn some stuff in college and spend decades in the corporate world building buzzword resumes. Doctors who do keep up are the cutting edge developers and entrepreneurs either making bazillions of dollars, making the word a better place, or at least being happy knowing you're one of those at the top instead on one of those to scared to climb the mountain.<p>I know your questions are not directed to me, but I just have to answer them: 1) No I wouldn't be comfortable going to a physician that's not well read and informed on the greatest and latest. My family of doctors also operated a series of medical book stores, which I managed for a few years and spent half the time reading the medical books. If a doctor can't answer the simplest things I got out of 5~10 year old books he should have in his library anyways, I'm leaving ASAP. 2) Last Tuesday. The Dentist is actually really well read.

Expensive, yes. But the speed difference is amazing. It completely changed my work and productivity. Using a computer 8+ hours a day, it is easy to forget how much time you loose a day/week/month waiting on app to load, files to open, etc. The 2010 MBP (with SSD) is the nicest machine I've ever worke with.",1291597979

However, what happens when I'm asked to break down my report by whether the purchasers of the SKU were new customers or returning customers? (Also, a count is not sufficient, since someone might want the report run for a specific date range).<p>I could keep two counts in the SKUs document, of course. It doesn't sound very efficient, though, if the procedure when asked for some new report is that I have to go modify the database document layout to specifically support that new report, then do some kind of back fill, and then modify the code that processes orders to fill in the new stuff as orders are processed.<p>As I said, I didn't get far into NoSQL, so maybe it is a lot easier than it seems to me now.",1291597896

1973360,comment,1971641,1971685,0,0,_delirium,,,"Hmm, of the mathematics grad students I've met, I don't actually notice a huge correlation between diligent, hardworking students and the most successful students. Some of the most diligent are just... not great at coming up with independent, novel mathematics, though they can do okay on exams. And there are some vaguely slackerly types who do great, novel work. Of course, <i>some</i> effort is a prerequisite, so the most slackerly just fail out of grad school entirely. But past some threshhold sufficient to be able to do the work at all, it sure <i>looks</i> like some sort of natural talent, or aptitude acquired at a previous stage of life, is what differentiates the mediocre from the great grad students. I can't say for certain, but unless I know totally unrepresentative people, it doesn't seem to be a matter of who puts in 80 hrs/wk versus 40 (or even 30); some of those on the low end of hours spent are very good and produce impactful theses, while some who work all the time are just not great at it.",1291597707

You should setup a site, start posting all over the place, etc. You want to have a lot of channels to get work through, when you're starting out you'll have to spend more time looking for work than doing work. Also, get in touch with freelance professionals in your area. You can get a lot of business through referrals and the sale is so much easier when they've been referred from someone they trust.<p>As others have said, WordPress themes.<p>The market is crazy right now, go find a designer and partner with them to make themes. I found the whole niche by chance, I needed a designer for another project and saw on craigslist a designer looking for someone to create a theme from his designs for a new site in exchange for a free design.<p>I replied, did the theme and setup his new site, then we started working together. I ended up dropping the other project once I saw the demand. Saving that free design for something else now.<p>He's one of the best designers I've worked with, show him a few designs you like from his portfolio tell him a little bit about your company/project and he comes back with a stunning design in a day or two. A few days later I've got it turned into a WP theme. You can see his portfolio here: <a href=""http://highendcustomlayouts.com/portfolio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highendcustomlayouts.com/portfolio</a><p>We're working on a RoR app to take PSD files and turn them into WP themes in about 5-15 minutes.<p>Also, find a writer, if you can offer the whole package from copy to design to hosting it makes getting the deal that much easier.<p>We're starting to get pretty busy with work doing this so if you drop me an email I might be able to hook you up with some work in the future.",1291597451

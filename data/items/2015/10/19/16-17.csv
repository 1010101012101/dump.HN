That&#x27;s very typical for the simplistic Rails-style of REST, but that&#x27;s not the original intent.<p>And that&#x27;s just the point and why those of us who care about web-friendly API design get a bit &quot;zealous.&quot; Imagine, if you will, that someone&#x27;s complete argument about the pros and cons of JavaScript were based on pre-node, hell, pre-JQuery use cases. Wouldn&#x27;t you expect some developers to be a bit upset that you&#x27;re mischaracterizing an entire programming language?<p>Keep in mind, a lot of what REST is known for today came to pass as a backlash against XML-deathstar-style architectural designs for web services over 10 years ago. At the time, plenty of folks were simply porting ideas and designs from CORBA-style RPC architectures over to the web. While this is possible, you lose all sorts of advantages of an internet-centric design. And that&#x27;s really what REST is about: designing applications that work <i>with</i> the web, not against it.",1445273942

I tried to write the GUI portion of my programs with Python and PyGTK. I needed to write a simple function that scaled up a bitmap from 256x224 to 512x448. A nearest-neighbor pixel doubler with no interpolation, color conversion, or anything else. It ended up running at around 30fps with nothing but the scaling, on a Core i7-2600k processor.

But to be 2500% slower or more is completely unacceptable for production code. That level of performance only works on websites with small amounts of traffic, or on the simplest of applications.<p>The root problem here is of course dynamic typing. That makes scaling both performance and code size much more challenging.<p>Java is certainly vastly better, but the garbage collection and its stalls, wasteful memory usage (I&#x27;ve seen our production servers bog down with Tomcat eating up all the RAM on the server for simple programs), and overall extreme negatives of the language itself (no unsigned integers, limited to single inheritance, terrible support for generics [maybe this has changed recently?], etc), plus the legal issues that Oracle is saddling the language with, make it an unacceptable alternative.<p>C# might have been better if Microsoft ever cared about any platform other than Windows.<p>Both dynamic typing and garbage collection are the wrong ways to solve the problems of C. Rust is the closest I&#x27;ve seen to addressing the real problems, but it coming from Mozilla (with their terrible record with Firefox), and the syntax being so radically different from C, I think will chase a lot of people off.",1445273134

I assume I was doing well, I was offered increase bonus and base after my initial year.<p>This response from Amazon continues to amaze me - first a post from Bezos that quoted an employee&#x27;s anecdotal experiences and makes the (totally absurd) claim that Bezos doesn&#x27;t know what life is like working there.<p>Then they have a post (<a href=""http://recode.net/2015/09/25/why-i-work-for-amazon-a-response/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://recode.net/2015/09/25/why-i-work-for-amazon-a-respons...</a>) from a Senior VP who doesn&#x27;t have the same experience as someone who isn&#x27;t a Senior VP.<p>Now they are digging up dirt on employees to paint them with a bad brush. First, the person with the killer quote should have been removed, no question. Huge bias.<p>But the second and third people? Nothing in the piece is wrong - they could have been strafed with aggressive language and/or they could have been berated in their reviews.  Look at the wording:<p><pre><code>  All three included positive feedback on strengths as well as thoughts on areas of improvement.\n  Far from a “strafing,” even the areas for improvement written by her colleagues contained\n  language like: “It has been a pleasure working with Elizabeth.” \n</code></pre>\nThis is the best you can do? &quot;Contained language like&quot;? This is truly terrible spin. At Amazon, they teach managers to give the classic &quot;shit sandwich&quot; - good/bad/good. I saw many examples (I was a manager and reviewed many pieces of feedback in OLRs - Organizational Leadership Review) written EXACTLY as ham-handedly as this: &quot;Overall, it has been a pleasure working with Elizabeth. However, the fact that she did not know the margins for a specific warehouse group when presenting to our VP shows a complete lack of diving deep, and makes me question whether or not she really wants to work at this level.&quot;<p>The third example is similarly vague/wrong: &quot;Chris Brucia, who recalls how he was berated in his performance review before being promoted, also was given a written review... Mr. Brucia was given exceptionally high ratings and then promoted to a senior position.&quot; That doesn&#x27;t mean he wasn&#x27;t berated - it could have been overly aggressive/wrong (and you cannot dispute ANY claims written in the feedback, all you can do is complain to your manager), just because it ended on a good note doesn&#x27;t make it less hurtful.<p>But what this really shows is that Amazon is as ruthless as ever. They WILL go after you, they will dig up dirt on you, and they will terrify you into never speaking out. If you are a former employee (as I am), you know the stories are very very true, and NEVER speak out publicly.<p><pre><code>  When the story came out, we knew it misrepresented Amazon.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m sorry, Mr. Carney, the story was as accurate a representation of Amazon as I&#x27;ve ever seen in press.",1445272618

Maybe ten years? So, now the older crowd needs to constantly re-do everything because the younger guys got lazy? I&#x27;m not sure what the solution you&#x27;re advocating here is. Eventually, everyone becomes a fat cat it seems, at least to the eyes of the new guy.  I suspect the $bad_vendor or $bad_project isn&#x27;t that bad and the time/work commitment to constantly re-do it is non-trivial. Especially if by the time you finish this big rewrite its already obsolete or unlikeable in some way -- not HTML5 or not whatever is hot right now.<p>I think part of maturing is knowing how to recognize the grind and when to actually disrupt it in some way. Is $boring_logistics app really the problem that needs to be solved at $big_co? Arguably, the execs have better things to do and that judgement is what we&#x27;re paying them for. When it becomes a problem they should know and address it, but to a young guy spoiled by ultra-shiny ipad apps, well, that logistics interface looks &quot;old and boring&quot; but its actually doing the job well.<p>> but he&#x27;s just too comfortable.<p>Perhaps this is besides the point, but maybe there&#x27;s a shelf-life on human &#x27;can do&#x27; attitudes?

How does it affect us? Is it reasonable to spend ages 22-65 working in the same industry/focus?<p>Imagine if we put monkeys in a cube and forced them to do the same-ish things for decades.

Really the problem solving is the most important part, the rest can be taught with time. But essentially we had some very, very basic coding questions (not even trick questions) just to get an idea where the person was as far as their ability to write code.

The inefficiency is coped with by using less data for the exponent (which thus offers a smaller range). 64 bit decimal floats actually even have more data for the mantissa than their 64 bit binary counterpart.<p>> Decimal floating point just changes how cancellation/rounding appears, it doesn&#x27;t do anything to increase accuracy. E.g. suppose you&#x27;re using a decimal float with 1 digit of precision (i.e. it can have 1.0, 1.1, ... 9.9 as the mantissa), and compute 100 + 1 - 100 (i.e. 1.0e2 + 1.0e0 + -1.0e2): 100 + 1 is 101, which rounds to 100 (1.0e2), and 100 + -100 is of course 0. Complete catastrophic cancellation.<p>It also changes how often it occurs. With binary floats it already happens when you do 0.1 + 1.0 (I don&#x27;t mean the rounding error of converting 0.1 to binary).<p>When you enter 1.0 + 0.1 - 1.0 e.g. in python you will get 0.10000000000000009 as a result which is not equal to what you get when you enter 0.1. With decimal floats this doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>With every calculation you do the amount of precision needed can rise. With decimals converted to binary floats you use all of the precision right from the beginning. With decimal floats you can often stay easily within the precision offered by the data type.",1445272187

10413918,comment,10413570,10413570,0,0,btown,,,"There are very key points about GraphQL/Relay that the author of this post is missing.<p>For a Facebook user, all client-side cached data is stale. All of it. Posts are edited, profile pictures are changed (and those changes are referenced in other posts that must appear to be consistent with the image shown to the user). This is key to their value proposition - Facebook gives a new experience each time the user comes back to the site, thus the user will check the site multiple times a day. Now, you could cache if you could invalidate the caches... and this is fine to do on the server side, but it&#x27;s downright impossible to push a client side cache invalidation at Facebook scale.<p>Another key insight is that &quot;HTTP can fire network requests in parallel&quot; is insufficient if your requests are dependent on each other&#x27;s results. Let&#x27;s say you want to crawl a graph of nodes. Are you going to do a BFS with a full HTTP round trip at each level, collecting touched nodes and transmitting the border each time? When the latency of that round-trip is at 2G speeds? How would you handle this in REST, under the assumption (as above) that it&#x27;s fine to let the server handle caching?<p>Well, you might use the whole &quot;HTTP&#x27;s content types are a type system&quot; concept that the author loves, and annotate your REST request with the structure of data you want back. UserWithPostsWithCommentsWithLikes is a type, after all, just as UserWithProfileInformation is a type. And at that point you don&#x27;t want to name each of those separately; your Content-Type header would have some structure; it would almost read like a programming language. Oh, and you happen to have a server that can interpret that Content-Type piece by piece. You would eventually realize it&#x27;s just more sane to break that out into the body of a POST request rather than holding on to REST just for REST&#x27;s sake. And then, boom, you have GraphQL.<p>The post devolves even further towards the end, making a dubious link between Facebook&#x27;s developer tooling and its grander ambitions. Making realtime graph search, and realtime insights from the graph of entities, effortless to the developer and the user... that&#x27;s one way in which the web is evolving. Every company needs to be able to think outside the box. If everyone took &quot;don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel&quot; completely literally, we wouldn&#x27;t have airplanes.<p>Do I have gripes about the GraphQL syntax? Sure. Do I wish it was more like JSON Schema? Does grokking Relay migrations feel like reading a James Joyce novel? (With apologies.) Absolutely. But... are GraphQL/Relay a needed proposal to push innovation on the web forward? Yes.",1445272142

Personal attach on a former employee as the head of public relation for a multi-billion corporation from a personal blog seems cowardly. Did he give Olson a chance to respond? Is there extenuating circumstances? How did Amazon carry out the investigation? Who knew what when? He accused NYTimes lapses in journalistic standard; he isn&#x27;t even pretending there is any standard.<p>2. His attack on reporters is unconvincing. His rhetorical questions sound conniving. The reporters might not have asked those exact questions but they must have examined the named sources&#x27; credibility and employment history. Amazon might have refused to give details about Olson&#x27;s termination, ironically on employee&#x27;s privacy concern, and then itself divulges specifics, though I am sure after being cleared by their legal department. Noticed that Carney went into hyperboles here rather than stating any facts. A few sentences describing Amazon&#x27;s interaction with reporters would go a long way here. But no, nothing.<p>3. His refutation of other three named sources amounts to verbal parsing. Some parts of the review are good so no parts can be called bad. Written review is good so no verbal review can be abusive. No direct requirement so everything is employee&#x27;s fault and they deserve everything they get. It is almost offensive to read this part. If this is the best Amazon can come up with, it must be bad.<p>4. Cheery picking Amazon&#x27;s interaction with NYTimes&#x27; reporter. Select publication of correspondence and one-sided characterization of interaction is sly. Make public all correspondence, with proper permission, so we can get a full picture.<p>Fundementall Carney is a former reporter and whitehouse spokesman who is now attacking former employees in behalf of a giant corporation with enormous resources on personal blog. He is committing every bad act he accuses NYTimes of and a lot more. It is debatable whether NYTimes followed the ideal journalistic standards but it is clear Carney follows none here.",1445271622

Rather than try to hunt for a needle in a haystack, we&#x27;ve created a system for finding anomalies in code that&#x27;s already published. For example, you can build a set of signatures for &quot;bad apps&quot; and then repeatedly search for them (AV model) or you can profile what makes an app &quot;good&quot; and then look for clusters of apps that deviate from it (SourceDNA).<p>Consider an ad SDK like Youmi here. They weren&#x27;t always scraping this private data from your phone. There are some apps that have this library but that version is a typical, only sorta intrusive, ad network.<p>But, over time, they began adding in these private API calls and obfuscating them. This change sticks out when you track the history of this code and compare to other libraries. There was more and more usage of dlopen/dlsym with string prep functions beforehand. This is quite different from other libraries, where they stick to more common syscalls.<p>By looking for anomalies, we can be alerted to new trends, whatever the underlying cause. Then we dig into the code to try to figure out what it means, which is still often the hardest part. Still, being able to test our ideas against this huge collection of indexed apps makes it much easier to figure out what&#x27;s really going on.",1445270591

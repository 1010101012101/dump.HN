What makes you think it would not just be expanded every single time the review period came around?<p>It would be. But who would expect it wouldn&#x27;t be? The law against murder is not the issue here. It&#x27;s all the laws against all the things no one would necessarily even expect to be illegal.<p>So how about this: A law can be passed with a simple majority but expires after 10 years. A law can be made permanent (in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t expire, not that it can&#x27;t be repealed) only if it is passed unanimously in both houses and not passed using a veto override. Obviously then murder can become permanently illegal since that will have 100.00% support. But every decade we have to have a debate about each of the laws that didn&#x27;t have unanimous support originally, and anything so unimportant that nobody even remembers it can fall off the books before it becomes an anachronism.",1371872812

I was calling out a tendency towards detracting pedantry that seems quite common amongst the &quot;Karma Superstars&quot; of Hacker News. Rayiner&#x27;s interjection that the &quot;actual&quot; incitement to the penning of the fourth amendment was, specifically, the intrusion of the British into citizens&#x27; homes may be correct. If I understand correctly, he&#x27;s (she&#x27;s?) a lawyer by profession, so there&#x27;s a good chance it is.<p>It&#x27;s just irrelevant. It&#x27;s technically true and completely beside the point that pvnick was making about the spirit of the law, something that rayiner seems to have a difficult grasp on given his (her?) incessant need to describe in condescending tone and dismissive language that &quot;actually,&quot; &quot;technically,&quot; whatever the person he&#x27;s (she&#x27;s?) responding to has said is, under statute or precedent or treaty or scholarly interpretation, incorrect. It&#x27;s a frustrating way of avoiding responding to a person&#x27;s clear and obvious point by instead nitpicking about this statute, or that precedent, or treaty X, while giving off the false impression that something relevant to the discussion at hand has been said. And the Hacker News community seems to gobble it up.<p>Rayiner doesn&#x27;t need to spell out a claim in plain words and sentences for the tone of his message to convey one, though his choice of sentences often does. Hell, he&#x27;s given a perfect example of what I&#x27;m talking about in a reply posted as I write this that I can only assume was mistakenly attached to my post rather than pvnick&#x27;s. Everything he says about what the founders intended in the 1700s, and what the history of the law is, and why the original drafter specifically decided to include it in the Bill of Rights, may be 100 percent accurate. It just ignores the fact that laws are given meaning and power by people, and their meaning and power as seen by those people changes over time. To suggest that the fourth amendment &quot;isn&#x27;t about information&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s protections don&#x27;t attach to information and follow it around&quot; is something that very clearly undermines what nearly every person in this democratic republic holds to be the purpose and power of the fourth amendment. My right to be secure in my effects doesn&#x27;t end just because I place them on a server in a datacenter rather than a computer in my home, and it is absolutely disingenuous to suggest that the spirit of the law has not been violated by anyone in the legal profession that holds to that interpretation. It doesn&#x27;t matter if a legal scholar adheres to a 20th century interpretation of a 19th century law that is absolutely bogus in the 21st century, because the point that myself or pvnick or any other user makes about the spirit of a law has nothing to do with the scholarly legal interpretation; it has to do with the actual point: that the government never has free reign over my effects, regardless of whether I keep them locked up, in a safe, in a home that I own, on land that I own, and never ever ever do anything with them; or whether I place them, unencrypted, on a server that I do not own, in a data center that I do not own. My emails do not become &quot;unprotected communication&quot; after 180 days. They do not become &quot;unprotected communication&quot; after 365 days. They do not become &quot;unprotected communication&quot; after five years. They _never_ become &quot;unprotected communication&quot; based on _any_ arbitrary time limit. No matter what any statute or precedent or treaty says to the contrary.",1371872557

Any way this is a FAQ and has been investigated before:<p>> While I was in college at the University of Cincinnati, I was watching television and saw a shot of an aircraft landing. There was the normal boil of tire smoke at touchdown. I had the same thought as your reader. Thinking that I had a great invention on my hands, I did some research in the library. I found some U.S. Government (Air Force or Navy) documents that addressed this issue. They were complete with photographs of a very elaborate test sled designed to accelerate a test tire over various surfaces and measure the effects of load and spinup time. Tests were done also of pre-spinning the tires. Much to my surprise, tire spinup was not a significant factor in tire wear.<p>> Flight crews did not like having almost 1000 lb. of spinning mass ~15 ft below the center of gravity. The special tires made the aircraft very hard to turn, especially at low airspeeds associated with the approach and landing phase. The crews wanted gyroscopes in the cockpit, not under the wings. But it seemed like a good idea at the time.<p><a href=""http://archives.sensorsmag.com/articles/0300/14/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archives.sensorsmag.com/articles/0300/14/index.htm</a>",1371871378

5922427,comment,5911273,5917727,1,0,graycat,,,"The US is somehow a naive country
(for no good reason) with more
money than wisdom about &#x27;foreign
adventures&#x27;.  So, the US messes up
a lot.  I wish we didn&#x27;t.  As
Churchill observed long ago, the
US always does the right thing 
after trying everything else.<p>Some countries a lot less democratic
than the US end up with much more
wisdom in foreign policy.<p>If you have some specific objection
with what I wrote, then quote it
and argue against it.  If I return
to this thread, then I will try to
respond.<p>There was a case in the news today:
Some US woman reporter went into
Syria (she couldn&#x27;t have been too
bright) and met in a room with
a lot of women and children.  The
men were mostly off fighting.<p>One of the women was 14 and had
a small baby.  The reporter explained
that the main reason was that the
family wanted the girl to get married
so that she would have more protection
against rape (the reporter didn&#x27;t
go into what might have been the result
had the girl been raped).  Then the
reporter went on about how horrible
it was for the girl to have a baby
at age 14 (and get married and pregnant at age 13).
Yes, there are potentially some
medical problems due to her young
age and lack of physical development.
And, as the reporter made clear,
the girl was not going to be able to
finish high school.<p>Gads!  The US reporter was projecting
onto that poor family in Syria
her strong US views about women
in the US.<p>Instead, consider:  The women and
children in the room looked well
enough fed and clothed.  They
were not obviously suffering.
The young mother actually looked
quite happy and calm and really
happy holding her baby.  The baby
looked good, calm, happy, well
fed and cared for (the US reporter
did mention that the baby had not
yet had some inoculations it should have).  
Otherwise the young mother looked 
like she was being a good mother.
Moreover, the young mother was just
surrounded by family -- her mother,
brothers, sisters, likely aunts,
etc.  She was in an &#x27;extended
family&#x27; and no doubt just
awash in emotional support and
feeling of belonging.  There was no
shortage of expertise on how
to care for the young baby.
That
she had a baby at age 14 is not
ideal but, apparently, Mother
Nature is not wildly against it.
Also, likely in some Muslim
countries, such young mothers
are not so rare.  As far as
finishing high school is concerned,
commonly in Muslim countries that&#x27;s
not a big consideration for girls
(although maybe Syria, like some
Muslim countries, except for the civil war,
is more advanced
about such things).<p>That&#x27;s just the way it is in 
some Muslim countries.  I don&#x27;t
want to live that way, but
since they&#x27;ve been
living that way for 1000+ years,
it can&#x27;t be all bad.  For the
person under stress, it looked to
me that it was only the US reporter.<p>Net, the US needs to be more accepting
of other cultures.  That doesn&#x27;t
mean we want US girls 14 being mommies,
but it does mean that what that girl
was doing in that house and extended
family in that country was
not so bad there.<p>If the US
gets itself all bent out of shape
over lives such as that of that young mother, then
we will be chasing absurd
&#x27;foreign adventures&#x27; until
we are white from loss of blood.
To avoid this, we have to wise up.",1371870864

It is to call attention to wrongdoing, whether that be to actions or <i>laws</i> that violate the greater body of law and principles of a given civil society.

That means we need to look back and say a good century&#x27;s worth of prosecuting black people for drinking from the wrong fountain was just.

We should stand up and call for the prosecution of homosexuals and heterosexuals under state sodomy laws and, when they are so prosecuted, we should sit back in our armchairs, cross our legs, and declare, &quot;<i>Rightly so.</i>&quot;",1371870842

Just because you want to customize it in a way they didn&#x27;t originally customize it doesn&#x27;t mean they are &quot;pretending&quot; open source. The fact that they are allowed to customize it in their own custom fork is largely because google is not &quot;pretending&quot;.<p>There are plenty of reasons to ignore patches from outside that are completely valid. Google gets to decide the direction of their fork of leveldb. If a patch doesn&#x27;t fit that direction they are under no obligation to accept it.<p>It&#x27;s not madness for Riak to want a divergent version of a package. Nor is it madness for the package maintainer not to desire to take that package in the direction that Riak wants to. This is why there we have forks in the first place and it&#x27;s perfectly fine.<p>In short. No it doesn&#x27;t equally apply to the Riak guy. The package is responsible for cutting boundaries in the proper place if they don&#x27;t want to do the work investingating that then they shouldn&#x27;t package it.",1371870314

Having extraneous crap doesn&#x27;t bother me much at all as I hardly ever see it.<p>One of the highest value activities for me is spending time with my kid.  It&#x27;s a hard sell that getting ridding of extraneous crap is worth it if it costs me even 10 minutes I could have instead been spending with my kid.<p>Why do you value getting rid of crap so highly?",1371870255

For example, many tech companies are Delaware C-corps but all legal issues involving employees are resolved in the state of employment, i.e. California in most cases. It would be great if a BAH employee can share details on the jurisdiction of disputes, arbitration and other legal issues in their employment contract.",1371870241

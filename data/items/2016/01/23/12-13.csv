No preference needed.<p>This would allow developers to roll their own, and organizations to allow their custom policy as well (which could mean that the privileges of the user himself aren&#x27;t sufficient to change the cert).<p>There&#x27;s really <i>no</i> reason as of why this couldn&#x27;t be implemented properly. There&#x27; also no reason to not include a switch for it, really. This is all just smoke: most users have the privileges to change the FF binary, meaning that in most contextes malware has too (either through social manipulation or through exploits).",1453553952

And it&#x27;s actually striking how similar they are in terms of economic development.  Granted, I still saw some livestock plowing in Romania-not a common sight in the US-but otherwise the poorer states of the US and the poorer nations of the EU are pretty on par.  Particularly with respect to dwellings and the frequent lack of many of the accoutrements of what we consider &quot;modern life&quot; (Internet, computers, smart phones).<p>I&#x27;d say the urban areas of the poorer US states are slightly more developed than their counterparts in Romania and Greece, but the rural areas are pretty much on par.<p>And btw, the governments of those poorer US states are typically fairly cash poor and often indebted, because they have very poor tax bases.<p>And in terms of government corruption, the two are <i>absolutely</i> on par, I&#x27;d say.",1453553904

And I have to say that when I work here in the NL with people from France, Spain, Italy, Germany, ... I truly feel that we&#x27;re all Europeans.

The other day I found a laptop with one extension that redirected google.com to a scraper. Chrome did <i>EVEN</i> include a drop-down warning just below the URL bar that the homepage was being currently redirected by an add-on. Did the user notice? Not a bit.<p>In fact, Chrome adding a <i>WARNING</i> for it made me feel even more sad: they know this is going on. Is FF going to do the same? If I was an user with an extension that did that for whatever reason I wanted, I would be furious as hell to see an added warning which I need to disable (IF possible), and that will be ignored by most users anyway.<p>Malware developers will just get by faster, so Mozilla will not be able to keep up with the list of addons to blacklist. At the same time, initial approvals for legitimate addons will get slower. Reporting issues with Addons is clearly insufficient as Chrome Store demonstrates. In fact, I&#x27;m also <i>NOT</i> ok with the idea that extensions can be blacklisted at all, in spite of that &quot;added security&quot; aura around it. By the same logic, if extensions are required to be signed, then blacklisting (and blacklisting updates) shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be disabled.<p>And, let&#x27;s remind ourselves, that most of the extensions I&#x27;ve seen installed were side-loaded with other software (with &quot;extras&quot;) that was installed in the system with the same privileges of the browsers.

I got tired as hell of using formatting strings. It prints line, file, and function, expression and value. Since it stands out /greppable it&#x27;s easier to delete then random printfs.<p>It has support for different colors(to make things stand out) and uses c99 _Generic to support different types with a single &quot;function&quot; and c initializers for named arguments. It supports basic c types and you can sort of extend it by modyfing the header(unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find anything cleaner using c).<p>C99 only (works on gcc>4.9 (due to use of designated initializers) and llvm/clang >3.3 (maybe earlier but I tested it with 3.3)\nI was hoping to support msvc but it looks like Microsoft hasn&#x27;t implemented _Generic yet.",1453550534

You either need to queue these actions, or generate the id of the card on client side.

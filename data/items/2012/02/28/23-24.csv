It is also relatively simple and has a straightforward interaction with Linux system calls.""<p>It has always frustrating to say ""We use Go at Google, I just can't say how.""

Ever wondered why there's an UAC prompt in the first place? Because Windows assumes that setup.exe needs admin privileges (unless .exe explicitly states that it doesn't). This piece of engineering doesn't even have a concept of ~/bin. In fact, there is/was an official W7 guideline that said that all programs must go into %ProgramFiles%, which is a system directory. Now, what sort of a imbecile decided that it's a good idea to let an underprivileged account install into a system directory - UAC or not - is beyond me. So, please, don't mix Windows in.

However when they try to emulate the look, feel and behavior of a native app, the app falls victim to an uncanny valley where the app feels like a poorly made native app and those feels of negativity overwhelm the experience of utility in many cases.<p>It is incredibly difficult to pull off a solid mobile app. The only two that I've used that really feel right are Twitter and Facebook.

3645690,comment,3645127,3645127,1,0,cmubruin,,,"I actually think that this is an interesting way to get people into programming.  I don't think Javascript is sufficient for many applications, but it does serve a great purpose.<p>A lot of youth in the United States today aren't flocking to programming.  We need more.  And yet it's strange because programming as an industry is what afford young people the most opportunities.  When was the last time you saw a major non programming company have core contributors < 30 years old?  < 25 years old?<p>JS as a language,  TextPad as an editor, and a Browser as a runtime environment is a far less intimidating barrier for students.  People can see the results in a medium that's familiar to them (a browser).  It's also free and readily available.  No installs, no environment paths. nothing to discourage them.  In conjuction with HTML, they can see how JS/programming changes what they're viewing.  It will help bridge a lot of people's thoughts into ""oh, wow, I can actually do this and it has a tangible effect"".  When growing up I was wondering how the hell a printout to a console would have any benefit to me.  Yet, that's how I was taught (in C, C++)<p>It's also been difficult recently to find frontend engineers. Colleges don't train for this - it's all algorithms and abstract concepts that are great for backend developers.  That's why there are so many more backend engineers out there than front end engineers.  The FE side is under represented.<p>There are some arguments that this is a terrible first language because it's not as rigid as the others.  But honestly if you can't learn a language and then apply the concepts and learn new ones to pick up new languages, you probably shouldn't be tackling those tougher languages in the first place.<p>With HTML5 apps coming down the pipeline, people WILL need to know JS and we as a technical industry will need to accept that they too are part of the product/output of science/tech/web/mobile.  Some people won't be diving in more beyond that, but if they do, they at least have a foundation to build off of as they get into more robust languages.<p>JS gets people in the door, and it's not going to preclude others from picking up other first languages.  It's a solid step for bringing more people into the fold.  It's not going to be the best for theory, but there are places and time for that.",1330473426

I just moved to SF from Portland, OR myself and the difference in climate is huge.  Have you considered Austin, TX?

And what's more, <i>it keeps earning.</i><p>That's just one of the little ""lifestyle"" businesses my husband & I have going. We don't work 16-hour days. We don't even work 40-hour weeks. We did for about a year, year and a half, but we also took weeks and weeks off in the same time period.<p>Time tracking, let me repeat. Boring, ""saturated,"" blah blah blah.

I'd imagine if some of our friends saw that we really like dog-sitting, they'd consider asking us and/or reaching out to us if they were looking for a sitter.

Because people have an average of 200 friends, that means that potential sitters go from 200 to 40,000.

It is very much object oriented, it just uses prototypical rather than classical inheritance.<p>If your argument is that a choice should be made between teaching objects and teaching functional programming, I disagree completely. They are complimentary models of programming that are not in conflict. See the paper ""Open, extensible object models"" [1] for an example of how the object/lambda combination can be extremely powerful. Considering that, JS lambdas are far more powerful than those in Python (they can have multiple lines, for one).<p>Javascript certainly has design flaws, but it seems like a great fit for teaching programming, in that it is a small language that covers a large number of important programming language concepts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://piumarta.com/software/cola/objmodel2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://piumarta.com/software/cola/objmodel2.pdf</a>",1330470665

Wells Fargo is, essentially, stealing from PayPal on the basis of this person's old false claim. PayPal flags the account.<p>So PayPal did everything right: they were available for immediate contact, were ""courteous and helpful"", promptly reversed the fraudulent payments to iTunes, and his account was left in good standing while he was made financially whole.

It is a fine Rosetta Stone.<p>That being said, it would also be useful to characterize features that are completely unique to a given language.  For example, Python has 1) a unique and powerful version of super() for working with multiple inheritance; 2) it has generators (the yield statement) that allows state to be suspended and restarted (and allows data and/or exceptions to be passed back in to the generator); 3) the with-statement for managing contexts and for providing a new way to factor code; 4) easy-to-write class and function decorators; 5) metaclass support that provides full control over the creation of classes; 6) and descriptors for fine-control over attribute/method binding behavior.<p>Collectively, these capabilities make the language more than just another syntax for expressing the same ideas as other languages.",1330470551

I thought it was mostly used for teaching OS stuff.<p>It <i>does</i> have very clear, easy to read code.  I once needed a floppy driver for the eCos operating system, and Minix's was way easier to read than Linux & the BSDs', probably because it doesn't try and do everything for everyone.",1241434383

592208,comment,590829,592064,0,0,netsp,,,"Sorry. I didn't mean to seem harsh. Quick jumps can be very  hard on some people. 340k to 150k is very big. But I do think these are more end cases then it seems. The point to note is this:<p><i>I"" want to sell that house and move somewhere else.</i>""<p>In the majority of cases, people want to buy at a higher price. Even if they want to buy a cheaper house, you lose the difference between the house prices at the time you buy, the price at the time you sell (buy again), times the rate at which house prices fell. Say you go from a 300k house to a 200k house after a 25% fall (big numbers), you ""lose"" $25k. If you move to a more expensive house, you ""win.""<p>If your house is under water, you are in no worse a situation really then if prices hadn't crashed. You still have the same mortgage.<p>When you buy a house you lock in your housing costs.",1241433674

592184,comment,589852,591683,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Yes but that's NOT the issue were discussing here is it. You take steps to hide the algorithm from as many people as possible etc. It's not that hard to do.<p>Finally in a RL scenario I would use the password itself to generate the rotation schema. Provided you required at least 6 characters from your users and a least one number then you can quite fairly combat the brute force approach. The way to do this is to generate a completely random salt and then use the password to create a scheme to rotate the salt into the password. Then hash the result and use the known pattern & the password to generate another scheme to rotate the salt into the hash.<p>The advantage of this is that even if you have a the hash you cant just pull the hash out of the string and append the salt onto every password in your list & then hash it. You have to reverse engineer the salted hash for EVERY password substantially adding to your decryption time. Because the salt is also pseudo-randomly generated it also means that you have to attack <i>every</i> password in this way - you cant pre-generate all the possible hashes and test them because I have basically ignored what the user has entered and increased the keyspace up to around 8e+24. Even the brute force mechanism has a hurdle to overcome because the keyspace assuming an 8 char password is 2821109907456. (there are yet other steps to take to overcome the dictionary style attack)<p>Add in the requirement for the user to enter at least 8 characters at least one of which is a number and your making it a VERY bad day for a would be cracker :)",1241431594

8246890,comment,8246029,8246338,9,0,baumbart,,,"I have used both NixOS and Guix and can say that I definitely prefer Guix. Internally, the package manager is really the same. On the interface side, Nix uses its own functional programming language, while Guix uses Scheme which I am used to and prefer syntax-wise. It&#x27;s awesome to write configuration files in Scheme! You can write scheme functions that output a valid system configuration for guix. You can then apply guix, reboot, and have a new system. It&#x27;s also very easy to maintain different configurations.<p>On the OS side, dmd is also pretty damn cool. The whole system feels kind of polished and reminded me much of current *BSD systems, including a decent texinfo manual on the first boot. With the difference that you get a working framebuffer through linux on startup.<p>While NixOS is kind of an academical experiment, I think Guix really has the potential to become the only true GNU system. It still lacks stability and has some rough edges of course. Maybe Guix will also help merging the Emacs and GNU operating systems to create a single, tightly integrated Lisp OS ;) There is already an Emacs interface for Guix.",1409417802

Those protests are only &#x27;ineffective&#x27; if you imagine that conducting a single protest march or camp might change the established order overnight. That is not the point of protests, which are instead designed to register contesting views with those in power, and promote those views to other potential supporters. In that way many protests are, in fact, highly effective, and non-violent to boot.<p>The view point which you are espousing, whether you believe it or not, is a time-worn tactic of disinterested or opposed parties who aim to curtail freedom of expression by claiming offences to public order. There are plenty of laws for dealing with violence against people and property, but also laws protecting people who are engaging in free speech, and the fact that someone happens to be promoting social change shouldn&#x27;t be taken as an excuse to ignore the latter, or misapply the former.",1409417187

I&#x27;ve been using YUI the last couple of years in a lighter way. My code uses as much modern JS as practical, and dips in to YUI for things that are tedious to do by hand. Most of my modules can be swapped out to work with requirejs, jquery, underscore, handlebars, etc. without too much fuss. I&#x27;ve done that a few times when YUI was slowing down and showing signs of neglect, but then went back to YUI because I saw no noticeable signs of improvement, but rather found the code more difficult to maintain -- multiple dependencies vs. 1, and each of those libraries has a multiplicative effect (different documentation locations and styles, following the updates, engaging the community, finding workarounds, etc.) For a long time YUI had great docs, great participation from core devs, and a nurturing attitude towards 3rd party modules. It is when that love began to fade, without explanation -- the promises of improvements in the future began to gather cobwebs, and the community infrastructure began to crumble (forum, gallery, web site), yui dev participation plummeted -- that I and I&#x27;m sure many other YUI users began to disengage with the YUI project, even if we were still using it.",1409417118

Some stuff in both is developed by different upstreams (large parts of both the Debian and FreeBSD base installs are developed elsewhere), but the &quot;buck stops here&quot; when it comes to integration, integration-testing, engineering a consistent user experience, and generally making the system work for end-users. If anything Debian feels slightly more tightly integrated to me, though it depends on whether you frequently use a lot of non-base packages. FreeBSD&#x27;s model is tight integration of the base install and light curation of everything else in userland, while Debian&#x27;s model is to &quot;Debianize&quot; everything in the archive and ensure it plays well together, even non-base packages.",1409417110

As long as the commercial unixes had significant market share (esp. among paying customers), people developing Unix software had an incentive to write it portably, so it could run on at least Solaris and Linux.

As well as inflating the certainty surrounding his results, Stapel included more science-related terms to describe his methods when writing up his fraudulent &quot;findings&quot; than when describing genuine results.<p>&quot;Researchers who have analysed Stapel&#x27;s papers say they can separate his genuine research from the fictional with about 70 per cent accuracy. Now they are studying a larger sample of papers from many different scientific fraudsters, to see if the detection method works more generally.&quot;<p>Just think -- if psychology were a science, researchers could use scientific tools to detect fraud -- tests that were not conducted, lab measurements that were fudged, images manipulated to create a false impression, as happens in real scientific fields.<p>In extreme cases, we could detect fraud by simply repeating the experiments, using the clear protocols published along with the results. But in psychology, investigators are completely dependent on what people say, not what they do. If Stapel were in a real scientific field, he would never have gotten away with his many verbal frauds, and fraud detection would be child&#x27;s play.<p>Another quote: &quot;Stapel, who worked at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, used more &quot;amplifiers&quot; – words like &quot;profoundly&quot; and &quot;extreme&quot; – in his fraudulent papers, and fewer &quot;diminishers&quot; – like &quot;merely&quot; and &quot;somewhat&quot;.&quot;<p>Imagine a real scientist trying to defraud his university and granting agencies by using words like &quot;profoundly&quot; and &quot;extreme&quot; about his lab results. But in science, such descriptions would make no difference -- the lab results, <i>the evidence</i>, would decide the issue.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand that in psychology, because of its status as a pseudoscience, how you describe your work is more important than the outcome of experiments, and one can cheat with words. In a real science, Diederik Stapel would have been exposed within days of entering a laboratory.",1409416609

From there, it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a matter of finding something to build that other people will value and then telling as many people as possible about it.<p>The best way to figure out what to build is by thinking about what YOU would find useful, and then build that.

Just analyze your day-to-day routine and ask yourself what kind of little piece of software would make your day 1%-5% less annoying.<p>For example, I&#x27;m a developer but also a startup founder. I&#x27;ve wasted entire days doing repetitive email follow-ups to investors, partners, customers, etc., which means I wasn&#x27;t committing code. So I put aside a weekend and built a system to automate my email follow-ups. After it worked well for me, I showed it to some colleagues, they started using it, too, and before I knew it, I had a nice little SaaS app going.

Best way I found for that is social media -- especially Twitter. It only takes me 15 minutes a day to be &quot;active&quot; on Twitter, I can easily target BizDev people and GrowthHackers (my target audience), and slowly but surely, they start signing up. It&#x27;s been a few months and I&#x27;m on pace to hit your $500/mo target in the next 30 days.<p>Best of all, because I built something that <i>I REALLY WANTED</i>, even if no one ever pays me another penny, I&#x27;ll still come out ahead because the thing I built works really well for me.",1409415505

8246773,comment,8245855,8246273,3,0,saurik,,,"Actually, I don&#x27;t think it is possible to implement vector in the way you describe (so I&#x27;d argue that in fact there is not even a single working implementation that does that): using new[] will cause a default construction of all the elements, but std::vector must copy construct (or, in C++11, move construct, but never assign) the elements from the old array to the new array. AFAIK <i>all</i> implementations of std::vector thereby have a separate phase of allocating memory for the underlying storage of the array (which is done using an allocator, and which essentially cannot be implemented in terms of new) and constructing the elements (which is done using the placement new operator in a loop as it copies the data).<p>The real issue here is that std::allocator doesn&#x27;t support realloc. (Note that you couldn&#x27;t really use realloc as spec&#x27;d, though, because in the case where it fails to reallocate in place it blows away the old memory area and copies the data itself, which would have incorrect semantics: this is actually discussed in the article from Facebook as the &quot;notorious design of realloc()&quot; which made the usage of jemalloc required for this task. However, std::allocator could still have features for handling this situation, and implements based on malloc would simply have to <i>not</i> support the reallocate functionality. I imagine if more allocators actually supported the idea of reallocation this could be proposed to the committee.)<p>That said, the statement that std::vector can&#x27;t grow the chunk in place is still way too heavy-handed: std::vector will grow its size in place within the memory area allocated to it by deconstructing and constructing elements within the over-sized memory area it has allocated. In general, this memory area grows by doubling in size whenever the capacity is breached, which leads to vector having amortized constant time complexity to insert a new element.",1409414904

If they offer to (say) let you plead to only misdemeanor drug possession, then they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to then prosecute for felony drug possession, resisting arrest, plus anything else they can think of simply because you dared to ask for a jury trial. Sentencing can still be somewhat variable, which would offer an actual incentive to those that know they&#x27;re caught-holding-the-bag guilty, but would not be such a ruinously life destroying difference that it would frighten the innocent into taking the pllea when they did nothing wrong. The argument against plea bargain reform from prosecutors is always along the lines of &quot;the courts could never handle all those cases, so we have to discourage jury trials as best we can&quot;, and frankly, that line of reasoning is bullshit. If there aren&#x27;t enough resources to offer a jury trial to every offender, then I say we have a crisis of constitutional proportions, and dealing with it by gaming the system to force people to forego their rights simply to improve efficiency is a far more evil thing than most of the crimes people plead to.",1409414438

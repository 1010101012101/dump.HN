A lot of start-ups are not so lucky as to get funding and help from a company like Y-Combinator.  End up with a bad VC, and you can easily find yourself feeling 'caged' again.",1206986224
151232,comment,151109,151187,0,0,asdflkj,,,"<i>It seems perfectly reasonable to me to think that pg works with startups because he thinks they'd be better because he works with them.</i><p>You know what else would be better if PG worked with it? Potholes in the street. So why doesn't PG work with potholes, or any of the infinity of other things he could be working with, and making better? The obvious answer: because he thinks startups are neat, as opposed to potholes, or big companies.",1206986079

151227,comment,151040,151040,0,0,ardit33,,,"Ok, for those against H-1Bs, tell me how many good programmers you know that don't have a job, or can't find one?  My company is hiring, and they have hard time filling slots.  Even fresh undergrads are taking in multiple offers.
I'd like to see a H-1B reform, where there are more safeguard put in place against fraud (body shop abuses), and more green cards available.<p>Some people dream that if H-1B supply is cut off, engineers  will get paid as much as lawyers and doctors,  it is not going to happen.  
Once wages get to a pain threshold, companies will outsource even more.  Unlike a doctor or engineer, you don't have to be at the location to build software.  The engineers in the USA will be left only for jobs that have to be done locally.
A good lawyer or doctor earn knowledge thru accumulated experience, and a 10 to 15 years of experiene.  In Engineering, the learning experience curve is max 5 years.  There is great chance, whatever you are doing now, that in 5 years it will be obsolete, and you will be re-learning from the beginning.",1206985803
151226,comment,151109,151109,0,0,sah,,,"I find it kind of upsetting that none of the various disagreements with pg's essay that I've read have been in reaction to what I felt was the core of the essay.  As far as I'm concerned, the centerpiece of the essay is this interesting observation about organizational hierarchies, and why they might necessarily place limitations on individual freedoms.<p>He also makes some guesses about the effects of those limitations on the happiness of employees in companies of different sizes, which I think he marks off pretty clearly as being drawn from observation.  What's so incendiary about those, anyway?  Regardless of whether it's true or not, isn't the stereotype of the creatively stifled employee of a large company a cultural cliche?<p>I'm ready to stop hearing about this now.",1206985798

And how about finding out percentage of engineers at all these companies. And personally I am so sick of hearing all these BS stories of H1B's stealing American jobs with low wages. I used to be on H1B and I made (and still do) more that all my friends who are American citizens or green card holders. I have green card now, and that hasnt affected my pay in any way.",1206985793

In any case, the ""perceived noise"" question 1 alludes to is precisely the noise coming from the internet; that is, the internet makes it much easier for dabblers from all over to overstate claims.

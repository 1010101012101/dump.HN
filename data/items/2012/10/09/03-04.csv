4629887,comment,4627775,4629097,2,0,rayiner,,,"I don't disagree with you. But the post I replied to said YC would replace traditional credentialing mechanisms. I don't think it necessarily follows, because YC plays in an industry that didn't care much about traditional credentialing mechanisms to begin with.<p>Using things like YC for credentialing depends on the relatively unusual characteristic of the internet startup industry that you can do ""real work"" in the field with no little to no startup capital or association with a big company. For this reason, software companies have always been impressed by project credentials. Aside from a short burst when Google was really focusing on Stanford/Berkeley PhD's, traditional educational credentialing never really took root in the industry. I have a hard time seeing how things like YC will replace traditional credentialing mechanisms in other fields. Is Lockheed-Martin going to look at your jetenginegithub.com account to decide whether to hire you?",1349755142

Sort of.<p>There was a time when no one cared about Apple computers.<p>It's one thing to not care about something that you are not (made) aware of.  It's another thing to not care about something that is common knowledge.<p>If Apple was not using UNIX and C, if Steve Jobs had not pushed them to drop OS9, I might not be thinking of Bell Labs when I look at Apple.  But essentially by using New Jersey's work, in my opinion, Steve Jobs was admitting ""We can't do any better.""  He borrowed someone else's work of simplicity.<p>I guess a lot of developers want to believe the public will never ever know how to build things, simple things, using the same substrate as Jobs.  That's fine.  Personally, I'm not so sure.  At this point the public is still not even aware the possibility exists.  We don't necessarily know what they'll do once they know.

CRUD Technician is going to to need some PR work though!<p>I don't know why intelligent people with a little knowledge automatically think they are going to be rich. This causes a lot of heart burn and pain to people in later parts of their lives when they figure out things don't work that way in the real world.<p>Regardless of whatever you may think about them. You may even think them undeserving of all the money they earn, you may think they are stupid. The fact is abstraction enables people to work with a lot of things without knowing much about them in detail. In fact abstractions are invented for that very purpose. So that a million people shouldn't waste their time, energy and effort to relearn things, when all their resources can be better utilized to know just the abstract details and build things on top of it. This enables people to build things quickly on what is already available.<p>Revenues, money et al are dictated by what the world considers valuable at any time. You might know 1000 algorithms from the book, you might have studied every other data structure that's out there. But if knowing how to write a SQL query is what is valuable in the economy right now, guys doing that are likely to be paid more than you.<p>This isn't surprising at all. As developers we enjoy a unique position in the market. As for the money we get, compare this with any other industry, our peers working there get paid well less. How is is possible that people who work at the same level of difficult as we do get paid less than us?

And when you ask them about their interests, they rattle off the list I just made.

4629845,comment,4629317,4629733,18,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Not knowing much about your situation, here are some general tips that may or may not be useful. Also, recommending again Daniel Goleman's work for developing basic social literacy.<p>1) Be happy about the size of your social circle. Some people think they have to run out and make lots of friends as quickly as possible. I think it's better to hang out with the people you know and work on just having a good attitude. More friends (if that's really what you want) will happen of their own accord.<p>2) Relatedly, let things evolve naturally. It's better to be relatively hands-off, go with the flow and resist the temptation to manufcature new relationships/friendships/hobbies/social interactions.<p>3) Do things you like, regardless of where they take you socially. Some people think you can't go to a movie without friends. I think the opposite - you should be doing stuff you enjoy, without worrying too much about whether there are people doing it with you.<p>4) Then, look for opportunities to invite people to do stuff with you. If it's stuff you like doing anyway, you'll be more enjoyable to hang out with.<p>5) Be open to anything. People offer you chances to go do new things - dinner at their place, a concert, paintball - all the time. Take up the opportunities. If you're agreeable, eager, and ready to learn, people will love having you around.<p>6) Be faithful. Some people seem to have a bad habit of ditching old friends when new, cooler ones seem to be available - like now they have a chance to hang out with the cool kids, so they're going to get rid of those embarrassing old weirdos they were making do with for a while. Don't do this! It won't make you happy, it'll just make you a fake asshole. Staying true to your old friends, regardless of their quirks, is key to staying true to yourself, and very important if you are doing better socially and making friends. Remember your roots.<p>7) Say nice things. Just make an effort to say nice things, often. Compliment people on their clothes, taste in music, abilites, work they've done, house, whatever. You might think you're very complimentary but I think it can be surprising (if you're anything like me) how much people appreciate hearing you voice your approval aloud. People love it.<p>8) Use agreeable words like ""yes,"" ""sure,"" ""okay,"" ""awesome,"" and so on. Say ""great"" instead of ""good."" Say ""great!!"" instead of just ""great."" Just try consciously to change your language to use more positives. At first it might feel a bit weird but it makes a big difference, and it becomes more natural. You will just become a more positive person. (Did you notice that I tried to give as much of this advice in positives rather than negatives?)<p>9) Be yourself. Do you want to hang out with people right now or just be on your own? Do you what you want to do. Pay attention to your own feelings, and try and communicate what you are feeling clearly - while being respectful and considerate of course. Pay attention to your inner state.<p>10) Real importantly, it's okay if you don't click with everyone. Maybe what you're looking for is just two or three really close friends. If so, those are going to be people you can really, really relate to. Feeling comfortable with others starts with honesty. It's not about trying to act cool or super friendly, it's about being yourself around people you trust and who trust you. It's not always easy to find people who fit with you (and for whom you fit likewise) but it's worth it. The main thing is not to worry, with these things it can feel like nothing is changing and nothing will ever changes for aaaaaaages, then suddenly, overnight, it all just happens. It usually finally happens, I think, when you relax and forget to worry about it.<p>Hope that helps. Feel free to correct me if my advice doesn't map to your specifics. Otherwise, good luck : )",1349754223

Your single anecdotal experience does not define the entire industry, especially in the face of both experiences and plain contract terms that state otherwise.<p>Take a look at the contract you signed to open your merchant account. Look for the words ""risk reserve"" or ""reserve account"". That's where money goes when the account is being reviewed or is reclassified as higher risk but isn't being terminated. Frozen PayPal accounts that aren't being terminated can still accept payments, they just can't withdraw money -- it's the same situation as a merchant account provider holding funds in a reserve account.<p>Here's some verbiage I copied straight out of one such contract:<p><pre><code>    9.16 RESERVE ACCOUNT\n\n    In addition to the security interest and chargeback rights granted to Bank by Merchant, Merchant hereby authorizes Bank to establish a Reserve Account, with or without prior notice to Merchant, at any time prior to, at or after termination of this Agreement, to ensure Banks recovery of any liabilities owed it or reasonably anticipated to be owed it by Merchant pursuant to this Agreement.\n \n    Such liabilities include, but are not limited to, those arising out of actual and/or potential post-termination chargebacks, as well as any and all post-termination fees, including, but  not limited to, costs for accounting, investigation and account management, charges and expenses due or anticipated to be due Bank from Merchant.\n\n    Merchant agrees that if Bank does establish the Reserve Account, it shall be in any amount that Bank, in its sole discretion, deems reasonable under the circumstances. The Reserve Account may be funded and/or replenished by Banks withholding or withdrawing from, or freezing all or any part of, the Commercial Account and/or accounts maintained by Merchant with Bank. Unless Bank agrees otherwise in writing with Merchant, the Reserve Account shall not bear interest.\n\n    Bank may enforce its security interest in the Reserve Account without notice or demand. Banks right to sums owed it by Merchant pursuant to this Agreement shall in no way be limited by the balance or existence of the Reserve Account. Banks rights with respect to the Reserve Account, as well as the security interest granted Bank under this Agreement, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n</code></pre>\nAs it says, your account may be frozen, funds may be withheld, the account can be established unilaterally without notice. Standard merchant account agreement. It's not there for no reason.<p>Many businesses don't have a direct relationship with the bank that underwrites their merchant account. They get the account from an MSP/ISO and some bank underwrites those accounts. It's the underwriting bank that does things like establish a risk reserve without notice because a big chargeback came in and that flagged your account for a review. When that happens, there is no opportunity for the MSP/ISO to contact you and talk it through first -- the freeze isn't placed by them and can't be removed by them. They'll tell you about it, and perhaps help convince the bank to remove it, but that'll happen after.",1349752811

I was tangentially involved in things way back in the early 90's, when the private space geeks were regarded as crackpots by the mainstream aerospace community, if indeed they were acknowledged at all.

No one wants to go through the rabbit holes of corporatized QA team B.S. but product refinement is a different topic entirely than the point of his comment, which was testing that product before launching it to the masses.<p>If you think your product won't be seen by many customers, well OK. Set it free. If you have a major push behind it, however, and know 100's of thousands of people are going to be mashing it to death in the first few hours or days, adding a time buffer for testing beyond your close family and friends is wise advice. It will save you money in the long run, too.<p>The alternative is to become buried under an avalanche of crash reports, bad reviews and ratings.

In some ways, (if my hypothesis is true) realizing what the problem is has been a huge relief- I'm no longer mystified about why some people seem to have large social networks, and I have a small one. It's almost like someone finding out they were colorblind, and then realizing that maybe that was the reason they didn't really like some visual art that everyone else seemed to love.<p>But, I'm still unsure how to approach this problem.

388437,comment,386910,388337,0,0,Retric,,,"After sarah paulin chose her glasses that brand become unusually popular.  I don't think the idea it was ""Free"" advertising really matters the effect is the same.  Tom Cruise has a long history of exposure which is part of why he is paid that much.  But, you could also consider he the idea he is worth 50,000x as much because he increases the movies revenue and he helps the movie get financed.<p>In most cases I suspect ""brand"" acts like a multiplyer so Apple's HDD might be worth 1.25 times as much as another just because of the reputation.  IBM might be 30% better and have 2x the brand so they charge 2.6x what other consultant companies charge etc.  Clearly major movies have great hairdressers but they don't get to charge 50,000x as much because a lower increase in value and a lower level of brand recognition.<p>PS: This get's confusing when considering something like breitling watches where a lot of the value comes from the price tag and not the physical watch.  When someone knows you spent 250,000 on your watch they know you have money even if they can't see your car / house etc.",1228602821

Given the current system, you can't receive a given medical treatment unless you can convince a doctor to authorize it.  Even if you are willing to pay out of pocket, you are out of luck unless you can find a doctor who is on the same page as you.<p>Right now, I'm trying to get a blood test for Vitamin D, but all the doctors I've gone to see are ignorant of the latest Vitamin D research, and don't see the value of doing the  test.  If I can't find a doctor who will authorize it in the next year or so, then I'm probably going to drive down to the US and pay cash using Direct Labs (<a href=""http://www.directlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.directlabs.com/</a>) or the Life Extension Foundation (<a href=""http://www.lef.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lef.org/</a>).

388434,comment,387789,388183,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes, that's true.  One of my best contracts was obtained because of the book.  It <i>is</i> surprising how much cach√© a published book has.  And for folks looking to make a living from Open Source software, I'd recommend writing a book about your project, since it gives you a huge amount of credibility within the community.<p>Though there are some publishers who put out crappy books that I would think would have a negative impact on your credibility.  I won't name names, but two folks I know to be very smart and definitely experts in their field (I believe both are users here, though not frequent users), wrote books for Apress and Packt, respectively...and both are pretty sloppy, occasionally repetitive, and sometimes even wrong.  The funny thing is that I know they're both capable of writing great documentation, because they've done it for their projects for years.<p>I had quite a bit of editor input throughout the process of writing my book for No Starch, and I was one of the technical readers for an O'Reilly title, so I know that a lot of effort goes into making sure books from top name publishers (and mid-tiers like No Starch) are readable and reasonably accurate.<p>Then again, I don't know that anyone who ever hired me because of my book actually read it.  So maybe it doesn't matter if the book is sloppy.  Maybe it just matters that it's available at Amazon.",1228602698

Do you believe what the startup is doing is worthwhile? How much of what keeps you there is just a need for a job, and how much is due to you wanting this job in particular?<p>2. Does his code function correctly? Is it overly fragile? Has it proved to be a maintainability problem in the past? Have others complained about your boss's coding style and defensiveness? If so, what action have they taken?<p>3. Have others commented on how you approach your boss in these instances? Do you seem overly abrasive? Do you stand your ground when he disagrees, or do you give in as soon as he does? If the latter, do you think you would face severe consequences if you <i>did</i> stand your ground?<p>Lots of questions, but narrowing down what is important to you will help me and others give you better advice.",1228601929

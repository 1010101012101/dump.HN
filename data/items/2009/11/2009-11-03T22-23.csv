920467,comment,910976,918400,0,0,fuzzythinker,,,"Re: ""Need for 'strong backing'"":
I think this goes back to the seriousness of how you take the discussions here.  For me, forum/msg threads are just causal discussions (one level lower than blog posts), it would be nice if the person stated where they get their backing for the idea or assertion, but it's neither ""necessary"" nor ""too helpful"".  If every idea/assertions needs backing, there would be almost no discussions at all.  Innovation often comes from idea/assertions that have no backings.<p>It is not ""necessary"" because to me, if I believe in it and it's important to me, I will test it out.  It doesn't matter if the idea came from Steve Jobs or Joe Doe.  It's not ""too helpful"" because often the research being done on it is flawed, outdated, or just really not too trust-able.  An example for example I remember reading some group has done research on max width of cell phones people like before feeling discomfort.  The Motorola design team was the first to ignore that when they designed RAZR.",1257288908

Right now, automated access counts as ""undocumented behavior"" at best. Bank of America is not likely to face public ridicule because someone hacked up an automated interface to their site which was not intended for that purpose and shot themselves in the foot. If, however, Bank of America says explicitally, ""Hey, come use this API and applications built off it to access your account,"" and then one of those applications starts shooting people in the foot, people are going to wonder why Bank of America thought it was a good idea to let people access their accounts like that in the first place.",1257288659

Sure, it might happen to help if you happen to have just got infected, or to be about to get infected, with bacteria. But it also might happen to be harmful, e.g. if you get infected by something when you're near the end of the course of antibiotics -- seems like a great way to breed antibiotic-resistant bacteria inside your body.<p>Contrary to what your article says, the British system does not take you straight from ""see your GP"" to ""be hospitalized"" with nothing in between. If you have, or might have, something wrong with you that requires specialist treatment, your GP will refer you to a specialist. (Who will typically work at a hospital, so you'll see them there, but why does that matter?)<p>If Polish GP-equivalents are typically able to see you the same day as you call them up, that's certainly better than in the UK. (Though if you have something that seems like it may need urgent attention, you will likely get a same-day appointment from your GP in the UK too. For instance, I think every time we've taken our 3-year-old to the doctor we've had an appointment the same day as we called.)<p>I am not trying to argue that the system in the UK is perfect or close to it.

Works just fine, and adjusting color is just a matter of picking out a different bulb.  My recommendation for cheap, indirect lighting.  And yes, indirect lighting is great, in my opinion.<p>There are (dedicated) fluorescent torchiere lamps.  I have a couple from GE, both dim-able.  One has worked for many years like a champ.  The newer GE one had the balast (non-replaceable -- at least without hassle) progressively fail over the course of a year or two -- slower and slower startup times; now completely dead.  A third such torchiere -- same bulb, also dim-able -- a floor model I picked up more recently that is made by another manufacturer, is also dead.  So, my recommendation is to stay away from this design.<p>P.S.  If one lamp doesn't seem to produce as much light as the halogen torchiere, try two lamps.

On my phone?<p>Yes, I am under that impression.  If Apple shipped with Flash, people would constantly complain about the battery life of the phone.  I have been working on user interfaces for a couple of years now, and I can tell you that my user interface code is <i>constantly</i> at fault.  Every segfault, random pause, incorrect data, data corruption, missing file, and plugin bug gets filed under ""user interface"" by anyone who is not directly part of the project.<p>Now, its possible that you're the guy who would spend a week testing battery life under various conditions to determine that Flash was at fault.  Maybe you would publish all of this to your blog, and 1,000 people would read it and agree.  Even if these were both true, the other 21 million iPhone users would be bitching about battery life all day long - and they would not care that Flash is at fault - and they certainly would not be able to live without it now that they spend 29 of their 30 minutes of battery life in FarmVille.<p>Apple has no control over Flash, and Flash sucks on every platform except maybe Windows.  If Flash really mattered, one of the other smartphones would support it and make the iPhone obsolete.  This is what competition is for.  What we need is more diversity and interoperability in this industry.  Flash on every device is not diversity.",1257287721

Unless you want to argue that said govt healthcare is better than the private healthcare that the rest of us get, the US has ""govt healthcare or better"" and more stuff.  By cohort, our poor people have govt healthcare and more stuff than yours and our richer people have better than govt healthcare and even more stuff.<p>Which gets us to the question of how our govt and private healthcare compares to yours, because the ""more stuff"" conclusion seems pretty solid.<p>> Retail spending however will not as you don't buy healthcare as a retail good.<p>What is the basis for your claim that healthcare can not be a retail good?

920406,comment,920110,920195,0,0,kurtosis,,,"I think this is a very serious possible problem with this sort of system, but there are ways around it.  The system could take everyone's whitelist and derive a ""public whitelist"" that it can use to filter articles and comments for people that are new to the site and have unknown preferences.  This ""public whitelist"" could be derived from an average of everyone's whitelist, with other heuristics thrown in.  As the system learns what type of posts a new user prefers their whitelist is updated.<p>One can also imagine how a user could use a whitelist on their <i>own</i> posts to maintain a separation between the things they would say in public vs. their private thoughts (which others may find offensive or unpopular)",1257286339

920397,comment,918842,918842,0,0,anelson,,,"I'm pretty skeptical of accounts like these.  With proper maintenance, the AR-15 system (upon which the M-4 and M-16 are based) can be very reliable.  The direct impingement gas system does increase fouling, but as long as you keep the rifle properly maintained it's not clear this translates into decreased reliability.<p>I think a lot of the stopping power complaints would be relieved by one of the following not-at-all-realistic changes:<p>1. Issue the M193 5.56 round to units fielding the M4 carbine.  The M855's heavier and more complex bullet has been shown to fragment less reliably at the sort of velocities the M4's shorter barrel can achieve.  Since the 5.56 FMJ round's lethality is tied to fragmentation more than punching big holes, this could fix many of the failure-to-stop issues<p>2. Back out of the damn Hague Convention and issue hollow point ammunition to our military forces.  Hornady TAP law enforcement ammo is some pretty nasty shit, even out of a poodle shooter like the M4.  Not as effective against body armor, but much more effective against flesh.  Our LEOs and civilian contractors use this ammo; why not our military forces?",1257285762

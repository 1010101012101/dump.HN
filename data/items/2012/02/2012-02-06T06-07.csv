Should all of western society cater to this, because some people feel they should?<p>As for insisting on performing other bodily functions it is because a) for those things it is a legitimate public health issue and b) babies are not controlled like an adults bowels. For that matter neither are babies bowels and it's perfectly normal to change your baby say in a public park (though one would hope you don't regularly post <i>that</i> to facebook).<p>Honestly this whole thing is overblown, and as unimportant as topless sunbathing, or nudity on television.

Being outside the structure of a corporate work-environment, I started doing this and it's been the most productive time of my life to date.<p>When I'm always fully rested and have 10-ish hour blocks of uninterrupted time to work, I get way more done.  The only problem is my sleep cycle doesn't always line up with the celestial day.  My guess is that's due to two things: 1) artificial light, and 2) I'm fairly sedentary while working and I don't workout, so I tire more slowly than I would if I was doing something more active.  So, I've found I settle into 24-30 hour cycle, which results in some ridiculous sleep/wake times.<p>Thankfully, I have the freedom to do this and it works great for me.

He thinks the barriers to development will be eased through better and easier to use tools, and he's right about that. But even today, we have Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and Xcode, but to produce anything REALLY good, you have to go deeper than what you see, and it will always be like that. The reason is because entire bar for quality shifts up when everybody gets better tools; the game changes and evolves. For example, today it isn't impressive enough to be static, we want the power to build databases and interactivity. And when we achieve that, we'll want to link them up to APIs and libraries without having know how. And even with these magical tools, a hacker could still outproduce a non-technical by X factor, because they have access to tools AND depth of knowledge as well.<p>That said, I think the distinction between technical and business founder is paid too much attention. In the context of entrepreneurship, programming is a skill, a means to an end. That end is a product/business that makes money.",1328510826

3556464,comment,3556362,3556362,2,0,lucisferre,,,"The title seems like bait. I think far more often (perhaps not as true in the valley, I don't really know) that business founders are the ones who's value is overemphasized. It's so bad that I regularly see ""idea"" people trying to justify majority (if not total) ownership while bringing almost nothing (often not even business sense) to the table.<p>I completely agree with balance, but the truth is that in the majority of businesses the preferred approach is to make the ""do-ers"" employees. The fact that the pendulum has swung the other way a bit seems ok to me if only to highlight the fact that motivated engineers can start and manage very successful businesses without the typical ""business"" guys.<p>However, just like I feel that organizations that only value people in business and sales roles for executive positions and partnerships are crippling themselves by their own arrogance and limited vision, I also can see how a bunch of CS grads playing business in their spare time while hacking with the rest of it, may also be limiting their organizations in a similar way.

Integration of monitoring, trending, and logging. Good graphing without rrdtool. Looks good. Digging deeper I see issues.<p>The free version is single server (monitors itself) and doesn't have alerting. Monitoring without alerting has its uses, but that's not what I'm looking for. Also, single server isn't what I want. There appears to be a planned payed version that supports multiple servers and alerting (check the page source for a link).<p>In a previous HN discussion of Amon (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3313991"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3313991</a>) it was mentioned that the install script had errors. Looking at the install script was the first thing I did. It's kind of insane. It's the kind of thing it might be OK to do on your own servers, but asking others to run it is really dangerous.<p>The installer starts off by running ""type dpkg &> /dev/null"". If that exits cleanly is downloads a Debian version of the installer and executes it. If type doesn't exit cleanly it does the same check from rpm and runs the rpm version of the installer. dpkg is available in the standard Fedora repository. rpm is available in the standard Debian repositories. /etc/debian_version and /etc/redhat-release might be a better check.<p>The installer goes on to download binaries on MongoDB and install them in /usr/local/mongodb. It puts the mongo client in /usr/bin. Does ""apt-get install mongodb"" not work? It consistently does ""tar -zxvf filename.tar.gz > /dev/null"". tar -v is verbose, why direct verbose output to /dev/null? The init scripts <i>are</i> the client and server, written in python. It works but that's odd, I want my executables in bin or sbin.<p>There seems to be a general lack of systems understanding, which is not what I want from a system monitoring tool.<p>If you are looking for server to accept and store application logs, check out logstash (<a href=""http://logstash.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://logstash.net/</a>). It will accept pretty much any non-binary input on any protocol, convert it to JSON, and output it to pretty much any storage system using any protocol. E.g., input AMPQ -> output Redis, or input syslog -> output MongoDB. In includes graphing and searching of your logs if you use the default output storage.",1328509860

That can be encoded two different ways - lossy or lossless.<p>A lossy encoder gets rid of unimportant data and keeps a ""close enough"" representation of the original. In this example, .1 * sin(10 * t) is a minor component of the overall signal (plot them separately if you need to compare the difference) so the encoder chooses to delete it and only save 2 * sin(2 * t). In a real world sound, this would be like throwing away noise that is so high pitched we can't hear it, or is so quiet we can't detect it. A real encoder has to decide what the ""small enough it can be deleted"" threshold is, and it's rarely black and white.<p>A lossless encoder looks at that signal and thinks ""there has got to be a more efficient way to store that data"". They are both sine functions, so that doesn't need to be repeated twice. ""x"" is completely unnecessary, because it knows the sine functions are dependent on some variable. So, it could write out something like ""sin (2,2) (.1,10)"". All of the original data is still there, if whoever receives the data (the decoder) knows how to interpret it.",1328508919

You aren&#x27;t talking about &quot;the old days&quot;, you&#x27;re talking about the prehistoric days when there were few humans.<p>Saying &quot;farming isn&#x27;t an option because you can&#x27;t get land for free&quot; is, IMO, a bit of silly argument. Arable land is (just like everything else) a scarce resource in a heavily populated world; it&#x27;s not by someone&#x27;s evil machinations that you can&#x27;t freely have as much of it as you please. That&#x27;s not slavery, that&#x27;s competition for scarce resources.<p>If you did want to farm, it&#x27;s (very roughly) $1k/acre in many places, and you only need a couple acres to feed yourself.",1427677075

Whilst it hasn&#x27;t happened yet, the UK is testing whether it can use passive radar for air-traffic control [1].  If a radar receiver can figure out the position of a target, it would be even easier (no losses due to reflection) for the target to receive the same signals and figure out its own position.  With a wide-band receiver, using all available incidental sources, it would also be hard to jam, since an adversary would have to have control over the  entire electromagnetic environment.  It would be even harder to jam if the receiver was using a phased array to figure out directions to sources, allowing it to null interference.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.atc-network.com/atc-news/airbus-defence-and-space-awarded-caa-study-for-passive-radar-use"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atc-network.com/atc-news/airbus-defence-and-space...</a>",1427677067

I write articles about gadgets, web, science, technology, space, and the like. And I love to read fiction books. My favorite book is the &quot;The Chronicles of Amber&quot; by Roger Zelazny. It&#x27;s a magnum opus of 10 volumes about life and adventures of a supernatural mythical family. And for a long time I had a dream – to make this book into a movie.<p>And at some point I realized, that it should not be a movie, but a TV series! They are becoming more intense and complex, and attract a big audience. There is even a very popular series based on the famous multi-volume fantasy saga. Yeah, that one. When I realized this, I quickly wrote the screenplay for a pilot episode. I think that it came out quite good. I&#x27;ve registered it with the Writers Guild of America, and can send it to anybody who can help me.<p>Next I found the agency and discussed this subject with them. The agency took its time to figure out who I am and what do I have. Finally, they told me that at the moment someone allegedly bought an option for a screen version of the book. But, reading between the lines, I realized that they just do not want to work with an unknown person. So I began to think about what to do next.<p>I found out that the book was turned into an audiobooks by TV actors Alessandro Juliani (&quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;The 100&quot;) and Wil Wheaton (&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Eureka&quot;). I found their managers&#x27; contacts and exchanged letters with them to find out if they are interested in supporting the film adaptation.<p>One of the managers was kind enough to explain to me, that his client is not engaged in producing activities, so, basically, when I&#x27;ll have the rights and the financing for the project, they will be happy to listen to my proposal.<p>I&#x27;ve created a blog at https://9amber.wordpress.com/ with additional information about this problem in a blogpost (I had to cut this message at HN down to 2000 symbols), and a contact page.

Videos consume large amounts of data.<p>But I&#x27;m going to add another point.<p>E. Lecturers most often don&#x27;t know what I as a student am struggling with. They may focus on things I understand easily and spend a majority of time discussing things I already know. However, if I decide to skip a portion of a video I could potentially miss a really important detail necessary for understanding the subject matter.<p>With a book I can skim. Important information is often marked in a certain way to make it stand out from other data. It&#x27;s also organized in sections and chapters so I can easily skip around. With videos this isn&#x27;t possible.<p>Also, what happens when all of this information is outdated? Now you have a bunch of videos with outdated and potentially false information out there and nobody will know.<p>My ideal alternative would be to remove lectures entirely and to have interactive labs where teachers and TAs help students complete assignments based on assigned readings. The instructor for the course would be responsible for overseeing the teaching assistants and preparing the course outline. The TAs would help guide the students in completing the assignments or mini projects.

9287099,comment,9283541,9284106,0,0,tadcook,,,"YoungButEager betrays a significant but unfortunately common misunderstanding of the term “protected class” and its meaning in law.<p>A protected class does not refer to any particular group of people, but rather the significant categories that anti-discrimination laws apply to.<p>For instance, religion is a protected class, but not any particular religion. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits discrimination based on religion because it is a protected class, or classification, that the law applies to. So it protects everyone against religious discrimination.  It does not just protect Muslims but not Mormons.<p>If it protected only particular groups of people it would be unconstitutional, because the constitution mandates equal protection under the law.<p>Some of the confusion may stem from other uses of the word “class”, such as middle class, upper class and working class. These refer to specific groups of people. But in the Civil Rights Act the usage of the term “class” is completely different.<p>YoungButEager mentions hiring quotas, but these are already illegal, and have only been applied in the past as a remedy where significant and ongoing discrimination has been proven, and a quota may be applied for a limited time by a federal judge. An example is in the state of Alabama, where the state had not hired a single non-white trooper in its history, and in the 1980s a consent decree forced them to hire one non-white trooper for every new white recruit, but this was only for a limited period of time. Otherwise, hiring quotas are mostly a myth.<p>YoungButEager says he will only hire white males. “It&#x27;s my firm and I&#x27;m not going out of my way if the &#x27;protected class&#x27; can burn me for three years in the media while waiting for a B.S. trial.”<p>YoungButEager’s partners should look at his misinformed attitudes and philosophy critically, because going forward, they present a significant risk and an ongoing liability for their enterprise.",1427675977

Really understand the concept of asynchronosity, and learn about all the different abstractions over it (callbacks, promises, streams, etc). Then look at how other languages (say, Go and Erlang) handle concurrency. Then come back to Javascript and look at things from a new perspective.<p>> Lodash is JS zen. Even if you don&#x27;t use it for everything, try and &quot;think like it&quot; when you are solving problems.<p>This largely means thinking in a &quot;functional&quot; way (as in, functional programming), and is golden advice IMO. Probably the most common piece of advice I give people that want to get better at JS is to program in a more functional style. Warning to OP: you mentioned having really grasped OOJS - be prepared to let some of that way of thinking go. There&#x27;s definitely a place for object-orientation in Javascript, but in my experience, thinking in more functional terms leads to much simpler, easier-to-maintain code.<p>> DON&#x27;T learn any of the frameworks<p>This is where I disagree slightly. I don&#x27;t advocate trying to become a master of every framework-du-jour that comes along, but I think that discerning the key features and insights from popular frameworks is a good way to augment your skills. React promotes a heavily functional style, and emphasizes &quot;one-way flow of data&quot;, which I believe is a very powerful concept. One of Angular&#x27;s more important features is dependency injection - this can do wonders for the structure of your application. These are just some examples, there&#x27;s plenty to be gained by reading about popular frameworks/libraries, without necessarily becoming a new flavor of zealot every few weeks.",1427675318

Every single one of us reports not only enjoying the experience but more importantly IMHO, we feel long lasting positive effects.<p>Our favourite thing to do is a `candyflip&#x27; which is taking LSD and then MDMA a few hours afterwards. You can read about what the drugs do individually elsewhere, but I will attempt to describe the combination briefly here.<p>One of the effects of LSD is that it makes your emotions very slippery, and what I mean by that is that you can very easily and quickly transition from feeling intense happiness to intense feelings of negativity and anxiety without apparent cause. I describe the MDMA as propping up the emotions you experience during the LSD trip so that they are entirely positive. It allows you to access and talk about memories that are usually repressed, in my case childhood bullying, without fear or dread^1. LSD on it&#x27;s own can produce intense euphoria with the right set and setting, but it is certainly easier to achieve it with a little bit of MDMA ;-) .<p>Since taking psychedelics I have noticed that I have become more open minded, more accepting of who I am and have a greater ability to appreciate the time I am living in now as opposed to waiting for &#x27;life to get good&#x27;^2.<p>One of the long term effects I have enjoyed the most is a greater ability to empathize with others, I am not only much more aware of my own mind, it&#x27;s fallibility, emotions and thought processes, but when in a crowd, I can&#x27;t help but feel awe at the hundreds of minds surrounding mine that are all equally complex as mine. Everyone has emotions, difficulties, hopes, dreams and desires as I do, this is something I had never really thought about before.<p>Finally, I am now at peace with the idea that I will in all likelihood not be a silicon valley billionaire or even wealthy at all^3. I understand now that success is not just measured by economic and social status. A normal person living in a normal house with a normal family could very well be more `successful&#x27; in my opinion that anybody else in the world, so long as they are happy, and content with their situation in a way that I am finding difficult to put into words. I am reaching here to describe such a person and the word that is coming to mind is enlightened.<p>Unfortunately, if I had come across a post such as this a year ago, before trying psychedelics, I would have dismissed the author as a hippy, somebody who is making excuses for their own failure or even perhaps somebody with mental illness.<p>Psychedelics are really something that must be experienced to be understood, we do not yet have the language to accurately describe to an outsider the happenings of ones own mind outside of a strict subset of feelings and emotions such as happy, hungry or sad.<p>Prohibition is a terrible event that is forcing people to live without ever experiencing these things. Your brain is normally limited to the inputs it receives from your senses. Psychedelics allow you do disconnect from such a sober world and invent your own inputs to an extent and it is wonderful. To think that most people never get the opportunity to do that is painful to me.<p>^1: This is characteristic of MDMA in isolation as well.<p>^2: Of course this is anecdotal and is difficult to distinguish from a placebo effect. I can&#x27;t imagine a double blind experiment that could prove this, when asked about long term effects, the active drug group are going to be very aware what group they were in, but the question you want to answer is not did you notice the drug, but did it have a long term effect on you.<p>^3: I come from a moderately wealthy background and there was a huge amount of indirect pressure to have a stable career and earn lots of money.",1427674846

The failure of HealthCare.gov under the old model and its subsequent turnaround using the sort of modern methods common in Silicon Valley woke people up to the possibility of doing something new.<p>The question, then, is how to get government working like we do. (At least where it&#x27;s beneficial; we solve a lot of our mistakes by shutting down companies, but government departments can&#x27;t work like that.)<p>A number of things have been tried, starting with the Presidential Innovation Fellows. [1] The US Digital Service is the latest pass. The USDS HQ is under the US CTO, which I believe makes it part of the Office of Science and Technology Policy [2], which is part of the Executive Office of the President [3]. The agency teams are embedded in the agencies themselves, and so I&#x27;d assume those are legally under the appropriate cabinet secretaries. I get all this mainly from the USDS pages. [4]<p>Personally, I suspect that this is not a lot of money. It&#x27;s mainly people, and they made clear that they will be paying industry salaries, not government salaries. And given that it is getting government to reduce waste and learn from the private sector, I expect it has bipartisan appeal.<p>Even if the next administration dissolves it all, though, I expect it will still have a fair bit of effect. As anybody in the industry knows, the switch from 18- to 36-month cycles to 1-4 week cycles is pretty much permanent because the culture has shifted. People just expect stuff sooner now.<p>But I hope the next administration continues the effort. At the meeting it was clear there were a lot of people in tech who really want to go serve their country by taking a couple years to make the government run better.

It expressed to me that what comes after this is just as splendid and precious as the life I have now.<p>I smoked DMT too much. 2 Grams is roughly 60-80 doses. I smoked until I arrived at too much of a peace with death. I didn&#x27;t care if I lived or died. Not that I wanted to die, mind you, but it just didn&#x27;t bother me anymore. When that thought crossed my mind, it was a shock. I got rid of what was left and never dosed again.<p>I am very excited to see psychedelic research done.

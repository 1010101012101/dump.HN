The rational minds at Google would have to be high on something really strong to even consider Groupon worth $6B. (If so, please share, people!). My cynical thinking is that these were rumors spread by people interested in seeing Groupon go public; the $6B from Google rumor makes for a nice, fat initial offering price.<p>Groupon has zero barrier to entry and zero technology. Unless they have a strong IP portfolio (which they don't appear to be, given the number of competitors that have sprung up), I don't see the value here, other than brand name.<p>I was given a Groupon for a local specialty chocolate vendor recently, so I decided to chat her up to see what she felt about it. She had tried Groupon, Townhog and a couple of others. She shrugged and said that she wasn't sure if she was going to try these again; but if she did, she'd use Townhog. It was clear that there was no barrier for her to switch. Why should merchants give Groupon 50% of the face value of coupon, if their competitor will do the same for 25%? And the next one at 10%?",1291441913

You can use A through D.<p>* Numbers 1-4 are ""flat"" sides, which makes sense as they have no case.<p>* A hyphen seems to be a second kind of whitespace that has to match itself, unless it has some other special meaning.<p>* The program, while running, searches for a way to fill the entire view area with a consistent pattern, though not necessarily filling every grid cell with a tile.

Students can't use that  service (unless they pay the fee which they mostly don't although I know a few who have done so) because they would look at the areas that have been marked as unoriginal and would make a few changes to make it go undetected.<p>at least that's how it goes. The system I have right now so far also highlights which areas specifically does the style change and in what way and by what percentage. It's being built keeping in mind a user base that should be able to get information with just two clicks . So it shouldn't be too hard to change the style here and there to game the system.<p>But I do raise hands in acceptance of your viewpoint here and call a truce (yes drama much) until I actually build a product before really making a decision on everything.

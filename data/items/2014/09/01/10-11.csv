So I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m solving it. But once I get that nailed, I&#x27;m going to do statistical text analysis to reduce interesting articles to summaries. I find many times that because I begin reading an article, I feel as if I should continue to the end. If I had only a paragraph, with no easy way of continuing?

This kind of tightly coupled code isn&#x27;t going to do anything useful for your codebase if you have a large application. It might make debugging easier right now because things are more explicit, but it will make you less flexible in the long term. It also doesn&#x27;t solve the problem that you still need to understand that A has to finish before B can start - which I suppose most people would simply solve with an additional event. The OP does mention this in the article, but I&#x27;m not convinced that the trade off is worth it here. If I&#x27;m to explicitly state dependencies within the event handling code, then that means that any time I want to change how things handle events, I&#x27;ve got to remember exactly which of my dependents reference me. This isn&#x27;t helpful - and in fact it may be more painful than the current situation.<p>I guess my main problem here is that the benefits this brings just aren&#x27;t enough (in my view) to offset the potential pain. To me, it kinda just feels like cutting off your nose to spite your face. You might make one area a bit easier to debug, but you lose out in other areas too.<p>On the surface the code may look more sensible and easier to think about, but in practicality I&#x27;m not convinced that this won&#x27;t introduce additional pain later on.",1409567223

Playoff baseball has some changes (for example, the value of a #5 starter is much higher in the regular season than the post-season, because he will never start in the latter; same with a deep bullpen), but that&#x27;s common in playoffs of all sports - you&#x27;re less likely to use your depth, and more likely to increase the playing time of core talent.<p>Luhnow is good, and he did basically play a big role in the Cardinals rebuilding, but Green simplifies this a bit - the Cardinals also happened to have the one of the 3 best players in baseball at that time at well below market value, and the previous GM (Jocketty, who is now in Cincinnati), made some astute trades (Adam Wainright, the pick of Chris Carpenter).<p>Baseball, for all that I love it, is fundementally a reactionary, conservative sport - unlike the NFL, which changes rules every week (or so it seems), and doesn&#x27;t seem to bear any burden from the media to provide the &quot;national pasttime&quot;, baseball is relatively slow moving and cautious, and seems to carry a higher intrinsic burden from the media and itself.

Resilvering, checksumming, scrubs are all a unified concept that are <i>file</i> aware, not merely <i>block</i> aware as nearly every other RAID.  The implications of this are massive and if you don&#x27;t understand, please don&#x27;t write an article on file systems.<p>For various reasons, the snapshots and volume management are more usable due to the integrated design and CoW, and also as pillars for ZFS send/receive.<p>The &quot;write hole&quot; piece is bullshit.  ZFS is an atomic file system.  It has no vulnerability to a write hole.<p>The &quot;file system check&quot; piece is bullshit.  Again, ZFS is an atomic file system.  The ZIL is played back on a crash to catch up sync writes.  A scrub is not necessary after a hard crash.<p>Quite frankly, for any modern RAID you probably should be using ZFS unless you are a skilled systems engineer and are balancing some kind of trade off (stacking on higher level FS like gluster/ceph, fail in place, object storage, etc).  You should even use ZFS on single drive systems for checksumming and CoW, and the new possibilities for system management with concepts like boot environments that let you roll back failed upgrades.<p>Hardware RAID controller quality isn&#x27;t spectacular, and the author clearly has not looked at the drivers to dish out such bad advice.  You want FOSS kernel programmers handling as much of your data integrity as possible, not corporate firmware and driver developers that cycle entirely every 2 years (LSI/Avago).  And there&#x27;s effectively one vendor left, LSI/Avago, that makes the RAID controllers used in the enterprise.<p>ZFS is production grade on Linux.  Btrfs will be ready in 2 years, said everyone since it&#x27;s inception and every 2 years thereafter.  It&#x27;s a pretty risky option right now, but when it&#x27;s ready it delivers the same features the author tries bizarrely to dismiss in his article.

8252193,comment,8251089,8251775,11,0,4ad,,,"The runtime is not regular Go code, it&#x27;s tricky Go code that doesn&#x27;t have access to the standard library, full of pointer manipulations using unsafe, and with no heap-escaped variables. It also has to deal the fact that the C compiler didn&#x27;t produce stack maps with type information (and even if it did, it would not have been that useful since it abused uintptr&#x27;s), so Go code must be really careful about when the stacks are allowed to be moved and how pointers must get proper types.<p>In short, the Go code in the runtime is about at the same level at C code.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that this is a straight 1-to-1 translation; this is not the time to introduce new bugs. After it&#x27;s all done, the runtime code can be refactored and it might become cleaner and smaller.<p>PS: there are no go errors, and hence no if err != nil statements in the runtime.",1409565990

8252184,comment,8251356,8252132,2,0,lutusp,,,"> I&#x27;m trying to imagine a pathological shape that would obviously float at one size but not when scaled up.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t go that far. I know models sit at different heights for different scales, all else being equal, but I don&#x27;t think you will ever see a non-pathological object sink at one scale but remain afloat at another. The reason I think this is true is that, if I take two objects having the same overall density and connect them together, this cannot change their position in the water, their buoyancy. If I think of the two objects as a single model, the same should be true.<p>But the difference between connecting two models, and a proportional scaled-up model, is that the ratio of surface area to volume is different for the scaled-up model compared to the two independent models. So the comparison isn&#x27;t perfect.<p>(pause for thought ...)<p>For a solid object sitting on a table, making the object larger and noting the previously described square-versus-cube rule, the table loading should increase for each square unit of table area as the model&#x27;s size increases, by a unit rule, meaning if you double one of the three dimensions, the table loading (per unit of area) doubles also. But because a boat model sinks into the water as its mass increases, and because that sinking is across curved surfaces, it&#x27;s more like a three-dimensional area increase than a two-dimensional one, so it can&#x27;t be compared to an object with a flat bottom sitting on a table.<p>The tl;dr: the more I think about this, the more I think I was wrong to say it the way I did -- and I say this because the shape of the boat hull means the wetted area can increase as fast as the boat&#x27;s mass, i.e. as the cube of a dimensional change.<p>Expressed another way, even though a larger boat model sits lower in the water, with some care the waterline position on the hull can be made to stay the same.<p>My mistake -- sorry.",1409565889

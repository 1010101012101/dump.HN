The creator of the page is generally the one adding the keywords, so there is an inherent bias that is different from the perspective of users who add tags (though they're biased in their own ways).<p>Ideally the perspective of the tagging users align with the perspective of users who are using the tags to access content, and so the users following the tags end up reaching content thats most appropriate.",1253624325

836814,comment,835821,835821,0,0,dkersten,,,"Telecom Company is too vague a term. For example, I work for a company which sells value added SMS services to mobile operators (eg, our anti spam/fraud product is popular right now). This is a telecom company, as are our customers. What you didn't specify is do you want to start a carrier/operator/ISP or a service company or a hardware manufacturer or...<p>What it takes really depends on what it is you want to do. In general, though, I think it takes skill/expertise most of all (not that you need it to begin with, but you will need to learn and its tough to pick up because theres so many densely packed RFCs, standards and regulations. For what I do, I'd say I sifted through 10K pages of GSM specs and RFCs..), money is no more important than any other startup, though obviously if you do something that requires resources (hardware?) then you need to be able to pay for this. Selling to operators also seems to be the same as selling expensive enterprise software: looong lead times, development and work to be done before the deal is closed, money after everythings installed and working etc (so you need to have enough funds on hand to be able to get this far). Finally, its tough to break into the telco industry because most companies dont like to take risks and a startup with an unproven product poses risk over the old big well established company.",1253624035

Needless to say, none of my ideas got anywhere. You need to be able to sell your idea, and I think the best way to sell to a more technical person than you is to actually build a prototype yourself.<p>I don't have a CS degree, but spending some time working in a software company teaches so much about software development. Roadmaps, iterations, hotfixes, and source control, to name a few. Necessary things I never would have thought about working on my next great idea for a website. All of this for non-technical customers who could care less about web services and frameworks. It was a very interesting dynamic explaining that a bug that was affecting them couldn't be fixed NOW and had to wait for the next site release. I now have a deeper understanding of how software development works in application. Not to mention the interesting dynamic of customer communication.<p>Moral of my story is that if you are not technically minded, spend some time doing some work that is somewhat related to software development. Bug reporting, tech support, etc. It doesn't matter what the job is, just ask a lot of questions in engineering and think about what's going on around you. Not to mention work on your own code after work.",1253623129

But given your situation, I would think carefully about Mountain View. There's so much talent down in the valley. The city tends to be younger and more design-centric. And Mountain View or one of the towns near it is certainly far cheaper.<p>Also, it depends a lot on you what your start up ideas involve. I would look at the Peninsula like an OSI 7-layer stack. San Jose and the South Bay are the lower layers, and then as you move north, you work your way into the higher layers. There is a definite clustering of expertise anchored by a a few big companies in each area. Core networking and silicon bending are done in San Jose by Intel, AMAT, Nat Semi., Layer 2-3 are down close by with Cisco. Mtn. View, Palo Alto, and San have some great middleware and web software - Google, Yahoo, Oracle. Then SF is a lot of UI and Application layer work. To be fair, the city is attracting a whole new wave of start-ups. And my OSI model has all kinds of glitches (like Apple being so far south). but I still think its a good guide line. If you're doing something similar to what Google does, it might make sense to be physically close to them.\nAnd I'll say it again, the South Bay is much cheaper.",1253623049

I don't notice patterns changing that much, but I do know that text changes. For example, I've had dreams where I fell asleep while reading, then continued to read in my dream making up the story as I went. But then it gets confusing so I back up to reread a page, and the story changes.<p>Another common event is that people and things in my dreams can be indistinct until I pay close attention to them. Just recently I was with a woman in my dream who appeared as just a silhouette in a shadow until I really wanted to know who she was and focused on her, at which point she became perfectly clear and vibrant.

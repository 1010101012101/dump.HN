Just for kicks I asked him to name 3 HTTP verbs. He could only name GET and POST. I know that's petty, but if a candidate is going to list something on their resume, they better know what the hell they're talking about.<p>The most atrocious phone interview I conducted, I could hear the guy Googling the answers to some of the questions I asked. Towards the end I asked what his experience was with DOA web-services. He of course responded that he knew all about them and was very ""familiar"" with them. I quickly ended the interview and said, ""thanks, but no thanks.""",1225950860

There <i>are</i> sometimes beta ""testers"" who never really give any input.<p>For my startup, we're providing a service we'll be charging for monthly. All the beta testers will get some kind of discount we've yet to figure out yet (a few months free, most likely, or some steep discount) and all beta testers actually telling us about issues something probably double that if not more.<p>I guess I just don't like the idea of rewarding someone giving me absolutely nothing in return equally as someone giving me invaluable amounts of help.",1225950721

355409,comment,354784,355399,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Because its about marketing, its hard to capture the ideas without sounding trite and simplistic. Basically keep your burn rate low while ""developing"" your market. And that ""developing"" your market is an iterative process of basically trying things, getting customer feedback, trying more things informed by that feedback, repeat until you find a viable market. In other words, just as you would iterate your product development (always with the possibility of going back to the start) you should do the same with your market development. Don't be afraid to fail.<p>Some of the nicer points from the video (in my opinion):<p>* 90% of startups fail not because of technological barriers but because they fail to find and develop their market.<p>* Too many startups try to imitate the corporate structure of larger companies - acting like the company they want to grow up to be - rather than having a corporate structure that suits their stage of growth.<p>* He recommends having a ""market development"" group rather than the typical VP/Sales, VP/Marketing structure.",1225950575

355402,comment,354548,354858,0,0,briansmith,,,"You are wrong. Small businesses want to use MS office because that is what they know. I've signed two companies up for Office Live Small Business, which isn't great, but it is somewhat workable. They will move to SharePoint Online + Exchange Online in a few months. It is only going to cost them $15/month/user. They are saving thousands of dollars and they get to use the same software they've always used. Importantly, that they are saving tons of $100/hr IT admin fees and they are saving thousands of dollars in hardware costs.<p>$15/month/user for Exchange+SharePoint is not significantly more than the $0/month/user for Google Docs for most businesses. The cost of Windows and Office is insignificant for them--compared to normal business expenses and the cost of the computers to run the software, the software itself is basically free.<p>Foldershare is a really, really nice utility. Windows 7's transparent WebDAV/SMB caching feature is going to be a killer. Right now, the biggest problem with cloud storage is performance, reliability, and disconnected operation. These tools make those problems go away, mostly, for the average user.<p>I learned all of this doing due diligence for a SaaS business that never got off the ground--there was no way I could be better than Sharepoint+Exchange, and there's no way that I could be cheaper in a profitable manner. The best I could hope for would be to build something similar to what MS is doing and then hope that one of their competitors bought it to catch up--not exactly the most exciting idea to me.",1225949566

Do they care?<p>In this case I don't think anyone's terribly worried about Google not having backups or dropping off the radar tomorrow, but they pretty obviously don't care about individual customers.<p>That can be solved by dealing with a small to medium sized business that has real interest in keeping you as a customer.  We pay all of $10 a month for the place where our email is hosted, and the customer support has always been a charm usually responding within an hour and at the longest thusfar, three hours.",1225949511

355396,comment,352800,353494,0,0,scudco,,,"I tend to think ""economies of scale"" or simply economics is a very difficult thing to understand. Governmental economic policy, whatever it may be, is the implicit practice of saying ""We, the chosen few, understand one of the most complex things in the world and we will control it for you."" I'm pessimistic of anyone claiming omniscience in something so complex whether they are an individual or a mouthpiece for a group of people.<p>Order in economy tends to come about more quickly and more judiciously when government is not involved. Corporations though they may finance or have interests in a warfare state are only allowed to exercise power through the fictitious legitimacy of the state. If Joe's Diner went to war with Bob's Diner we quickly see the cost of war. They are both out of business because war is expensive. Not to mention ordinary folks would not say to themselves, ""Well Joe over here is fighting for my rights! Support The Troops (of Joe's Diner)!"" This, of course, is ridiculous.<p>So this is why we need taxes? Warfare or welfare. I would rather be peaceful and sleep at night. I would rather trade with my neighbors than impoverish them through blockades, embargoes, or whatever else the government can only do through force of arms.<p>I notice you are very strident about what taxes must be used for, but my whole point on taxes is that if we MUST have these things then let us do them voluntarily through cooperative efforts. If you and I both want an organization to achieve goal X let us get together and achieve that goal. If someone doesn't want to help us out then let's try to convince them we're right not through force of arms(taxation), but through discussion and friendship. Be peaceful.<p>I think you might do well to study Winston Churchill's policies during and leading up to World War II. He and FDR both colluded to embolden western government to become more interventionist and war-like. I have heard that quote before, but I would challenge you, seriously, to consider a world without government. Start small with a family, then a city, then a region, then a continent. At what point does government intervention by force of arms against peaceful non-compliers become okay? I only ask that you answer that question for yourself.",1225949130

I think this is a matter of choice influenced by ones predisposition and experiences. Inevitably we choose to specialize in something and that specialization strengthens us in some ways at the cost of weakening us in other ways. -cheers",1225949021

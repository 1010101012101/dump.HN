So sure I can build my <i>Sprocket-Cog Software</i> more easily because many of the software components that go into it are available to me for free (beer) so long as I free the entire thing at the end (freedom).<p>The follow-on argument is that you can always try to build a services model around <i>Sprocket-Cog Software</i> and live from that. But there&#x27;s a subtle implication there that building turnkey software is not an option if you want to live, but making broken, user-hostile, hard-to-use software is the only morally &quot;good&quot; option.<p>(there&#x27;s another argument that can be dismissed that you aren&#x27;t prohibited from selling your software commercially under the right license, but that&#x27;s a stupid argument, nobody will buy software from you if you just make it available for free (beer) anyways, so your only valid option (and the only one that has so far sorta &quot;worked&quot; in the marketplace is to provide services)<p>RMS of course dismisses all of this with a bunch of handwaivyness, like he does issues with hardware, food, etc.  because he simply doesn&#x27;t have to worry about them (because he has money) or because he can&#x27;t find a path he can personally follow.

Dairy fat actually helps avoid obesity<p>I think the study over looks the most likely physiological reasoning for this, primarily suggesting it is a matter of satiety (feeling fuller consuming less).  People like to hinge on the concept of calories in/calories out, then highlight short term diets of ice cream and Twinkies where people still lose weight because of the caloric intake management.  Notwithstanding temporary loses due to reduced calories, such diets do prime one for obesity.  On the other-hand diets high in protein and fat (good fats: like almonds, chicken skin, red meats, ect...) do prime one to <i>avoid</i> obesity.<p>Each body and metabolism is different. However, the rule of thumb is that sugars (Twinkies and ice cream) release insulin which enlarges things in the body including tumors and in this case fat cells which does prime a body for obesity even if one is not currently obese.  But healthy fats will trigger the release of glucagon which has the opposite effect of insulin resulting in smaller fat cells which does help in avoiding obesity.",1431873031

Lets hope that Adelaide recovers completely and the driver won&#x27;t be allowed behind another steering wheel.<p>Just yesterday afternoon I had another reckless driver deliberately drive up close to a few centimeters behind my rear wheel because he saw me as an obstacle. This was just 30 Meters away from a red light.  The argument through the driver window, as always in situations like this, lead nowhere. People like this know, that there will be no consequences to their behaviour, so they keep on risking other peoples lives...<p>You might be interested in the german project <a href=""http://wegeheld.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wegeheld.org</a>, which mainly focuses on documenting parking offences. Sadly the interface of the app is not there yet.<p>Being able to use a phone to document and upload an incident report complete with pictures/videos and GPS location and GPS track info  would be a great plus to any such app. Also being able to warn other cyclists of reckless drivers in a specific area or of an ongoing incident might be helpful (i.e. if witnesses are needed).",1431872756

Some people do not have the opportunity to meet people organically i.e. through work or other such ways.<p>To relieve people from their loneliness and enable them to meet people with same interests, an app has been introduced. It’s a Social Networking cum Event App for Micro Meet-Ups. Meetly is all about people getting together. It not only cuts out the creep factor but gives you a chance of meeting people with common interests.  It’s the best way to get a group of people together that has ever been created. 
Meetly excels at getting those who share a common interest to connect with each other.<p>The Meetly app shows upcoming Meet-Ups that are organized in your vicinity and also public Meet-Ups as per categories. Each Public event listing features a category such as Business, Health-Wellness, Hobbies, Science & tech and other such categories, description, start/end dates/times, location, & even how many people can join you. One can even get notifications for Meet-Ups happening within a radius of 5 miles to 50 miles.

9560067,comment,9559731,9559731,0,0,rquantz,,,"As someone who has suffered from moderate but not debilitating depression for much of my adulthood, one thing that has always stood in the way of getting treatment has been finding a damn therapist. Back when I was a broke, insurance-less musician, I went to inexpensive sessions with a student therapist who listened to me talk for a semester but offered very little in the way of help.<p>Shortly after getting insurance I asked my doctor for a therapist recommendation. The therapist she sent me to was a very nice old man who started suggesting prayer as an answer to my problems in the second session. That was also our last session.<p>I wish there were a way to do this that eliminated some of the trial and error, because listings tend to be pretty neutral, and reviews are sparse and not particularly trustworthy. You end up picking someone who&#x27;s close to you and hoping it works out. It&#x27;s a great way to lose a lot of time, and you know one of the things about depression is failing to find a therapist after a few tries greatly decreases motivation to keep trying.",1431871693

I wrote emails to a few politicians regarding some issue I felt strongly about and got a canned response that didn&#x27;t say anything (I believe it was something about internet security or copyright laws and the response was how that politician understands my concern and thinks its important to balance security and simultaneously promote competition).<p>I did consider going to local council meetings in my home town of New York City, but (without exception) every meeting takes place between late morning to early afternoon on a weekday so I am unable to attend [0]. It might be coincidental, but that kind of scheduling doesn&#x27;t exactly scream out inclusion for average citizens. Maybe I&#x27;m just cynical. If you look at some of the minutes, it&#x27;s incredibly dull and menial. I randomly selected Council Chambers - City Hall Jointly with the Committee on Consumer Affairs from 5/1:<p>1. A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the promotion of health and safety at nail salons. (NY Times article drummed up some controversy. Perhaps if they were to talk about immigration policy and extending more rights to undocumented workers, it would be interesting but from what I hear, this will amount to a shake-down and publicity event)<p>2. A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the posting of information related to services offered at licensed appearance enhancement businesses. (Yelp probably does a better job at this)<p>3. Resolution calling upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation amending the general business law to require periodic retraining of persons licensed to practice appearance enhancement and the Department of State to increase the number of health and safety inspectors who inspect appearance enhancement businesses. (More regulation of hair salons because, you know, public safety of getting a bad perm)<p>4. Resolution calling upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation amending the General Business Law to authorize the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to enforce State health and safety regulations against appearance enhancement establishments and to allow the Department to create a letter grading system for these establishments. (Letter grading hair salons? Really?)<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just a New York or US thing. But I personally lost faith in the democratic process for all but the absolutely most mundane and necessary processes required to run a locality.<p>[0] <a href=""http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Calendar.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Calendar.aspx</a>",1431871650

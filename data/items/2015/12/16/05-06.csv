The problem is, we don&#x27;t tend to say &quot;does a room with a person in it and several books have this knowledge?&quot; Relying on a system that doesn&#x27;t tend to get grouped together (there&#x27;s no term for the system human + book inside room), and having only one animate object (so that people think of the animate object as the system instead of the animate and inanimate objects), as well as asking the question only about the animate part of the system, all seem to suggest that the purpose of the thought experiment is to mislead people.<p>A better example would be saying something like - does this company have the knowledge to make a particular product?

And my first instinct would be to blame the hardware, but in the case of Messenger, it rotates some parts of the screen and not others. But the parts that don&#x27;t rotate are unresponsive. So I&#x27;ll sometimes find myself in a situation where I&#x27;ve typed a text, and the message is rotated, but the text box and send button are not, and pressing the send button does nothing until I manage to get the entire thing to rotate by moving it from landscape to portrait and back a few times.<p>It&#x27;s also possible there is some cruft I&#x27;ve carried over from previous version (I&#x27;ve upgrade a few times) so I&#x27;m going to try a &#x27;fresh&#x27; install where I lose all my data and have to redo everything by hand and see if it fixes the problems.

The canonical example of the second alternative is Numpy.<p>In my humble opinion, the expressive power of python is what makes it an excellent language for scientific computing. For these kind of problems you cannot afford to worry about buffer overflows and memory allocations.

I think we&#x27;ve learned from the last time around that the public markets aren&#x27;t the best place to manage expectations in technology.<p>As for why the sponsors made this investment, there&#x27;s a very good case to be made that (a) efficient free-form communication within agile teams at small and large companies is a pattern as crucial to developing modern businesses as a CRM, and (b) Slack is perfectly poised to capture and <i>hold</i> this new market in the same way that Salesforce was.

Seemingly trivial patterns end up slowing your code down by multiple orders of magnitude, and there’s more “guess and check” involved when trying to write code that can be effectively JIT compiled by Matlab than careful reasoning. Even worse, the JIT and the profiler don’t get along, so it’s often impossible to get any insight into the reasons for JIT-related performance differences.<p>In general, Matlab is an extremely unpleasant and frustrating environment compared to almost any other language I’ve worked with. The only thing Matlab has on Python/Numpy is a nice quantity of publicly available code for various technical functions. Most of this code is hacky academic prototype stuff, but that’s much better than nothing if you’re trying to follow someone’s algorithm written up in a paper.<p>The Matlab GUI and tooling is a buggy and unpolished Java turd from the 90s which fits in poorly with any modern operating system.",1450243936

Few companies truly become platforms, and it&#x27;s a misnomer to call it a bubble if this only happens to one company. It takes a lot of money or momentum to develop one. Facebook had by far the most compelling one in the last ten years, and the obvious incentive there was  it&#x27;s >300M users at the time. The case is less compelling for a B2B platform like Slack, but it makes sense as many of these investors also invest in B2B startups that can gain huge visibility through the Slack platform.<p>By having six investors in the fund, each fund can mitigate risk of Slack&#x27;s platform not getting traction while lowering the barrier for developers to enter.  This slideshow by A16Z outlines why the venture capitalists (including some on the list of Slack fund contributors) are tightening their belts around investing and telling companies like Slack to generate reliable business models rather than IPO prematurely.<p>This premature IPO behavior was the reason for the last bubble, and I think this investment fund is proof that we are NOT in a bubble. The new strategy for these investment funds is to allow their startups to generate revenue on a much more stable basis without the need to go public (and get cash for equity) for this to happen. Most B2B companies would eventually benefit from a recurring-fees model built around the Slack platform, and this enables smaller, fledging companies to scale much more quickly towards long-term cashflow positivity.<p>In all, the kings of tech companies are those that find some sort of platform or natural monopoly. Slack may be next in line to follow Airbnb, Uber, Twitter, Facebook, and Google respectively. Overall, by allowing a method to build these platforms while not going public, investors increase returns for their companies in the short AND LONG term while maintaining a course of innovation!",1450242750

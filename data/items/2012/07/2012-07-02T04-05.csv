4187379,comment,4176075,4180550,1,0,eevee,,,"tl;dr: I value consistency in my tools because it's a great measure of how frequently they'll trip me up and get in my way while reading or writing code.  My biggest problem with PHP above all else, which I tried to write my article around, is that it's an inconsistent jumble from top to bottom.<p>You're absolutely correct, of course, in that you can write decent PHP by avoiding large chunks of the language, memorizing what things act differently from other things that look the same, not trying to do anything <i>too</i> dynamic, adding boilerplate to every project to fix useless default interpreter behavior, and so on.  You can also waltz across a minefield if you just remember where all the mines are.  But the necessity of doing all these things is exactly my argument: why bother with all this from a tool that's supposed to help you get stuff done?  Because it has $_GET out of the box?  You can't even claim ""ease of learning"" as an advantage after all this, because judging by your own responses, much of the language is pitfalls just waiting to trip up beginners who haven't yet learned the right painful lessons.<p>Yes, I'm not a PHP programmer.  And as a not-PHP programmer, a lot of PHP looks totally crazy.  But when outsiders complain about craziness in Python or Perl or Haskell or whatever, at least that craziness can usually be explained as consistent with the rest of the language, or part of an overall philosophy, or the result of some valuable tradeoff.  And if not, we're very sympathetic about the ugly warts on our dearly beloved.  Yet all anyone has ever been able to tell me about PHP craziness is ""well, you shouldn't do that anyway"" or ""that's how it is in one of ten other languages"" or ""I have no explanation but here's a workaround so it's like the problem doesn't actually exist, right"".<p>It is hard for me to understand how even someone who loves PHP can't see this as deeply alarming.<p>> You only need distinct operators if your language is weakly typed.<p>I don't dispute that: I claim that having separate addition and concatenation operators, but having a single set of equality/comparison operators, is <i>inconsistent</i>.<p>> Yes, like most ever other language in existence. You know, Java, C#, Python, etc.<p>Incorrect.  Python passes everything by reference (value reference, not name reference) because everything is an object.  Passing never performs a copy.  I'm under the impression that Java is the same.  Perl passes by alias, though the aliases are generally then copied to locals, and it has that whole array-flattening behavior which muddies things.<p>> Because all code should be contained within a namespace going forward. Constants should not be defined in the top-level.<p>Everything in Perl is in the `main` namespace unless otherwise specified.  One wonders why PHP could not retrofit its new features onto the language like Perl has done for decades, rather than leaving half the language to flounder.<p>> No, it doesn't work that way. You have to explicitly cast. If you use an array type-hint you can only pass an array.<p>I'm assuming you're using the explicit cast inside the hypothetical function.<p>> PHP is also bytecode-interpreted. I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make.<p>You appeared to be citing interpreted-ness as a reason for having a wonky module system.  I am naming other interpreted languages with useful module systems as counterexamples.<p>> The fact that is or is not a function is insignificant; you use it the same way.<p>Unless you want to do other function-y things to it, or any of the other pseudo-functions.  The syntax is deliberately designed to make you think something is a function, but it only acts like a function in one particular way.  (And as a side effect, there are a ton of simple function names you can't use as method names, because the parser gets very confused -- even though this seems like it should be unambiguous.)<p>> Oh, you're saying if you don't provide any of your own error handling and let it spill out the terminal -- yes, you're right -- no stack trace by default. Not that you should be doing that.<p>Defaults matter.  This is an atrocious default.<p>> Turn on E_STRICT and it'll tell you.<p>It'll tell me what things I've already done; I can't easily find out what I should be avoiding proactively.<p>> Calling a string literal is pointless! 'test'() is test()!<p>So what?  Both are values; why is there any distinction?  Hell, you can call methods on numbers in Ruby and Python.  I don't care about the practical value here; it's yet another place where PHP is inconsistent for seemingly no reason.<p>> If you've ever complained about security in PHP, you need to give that up right now. Because you just gave everyone a false sense of security.<p>Howso?  The problem with mysql_escape_string was that it didn't take the current database handle into account.  So: make it take the current database handle into account.  It may not have solved everyone's problems, but the exceptions are obvious, and it would have fixed problems for far more people than the actual solution (zero).<p>If you're using multiple handles and passing them around explicitly, you'll have to fix your code either way.",1341204825

Otherwise he just behave as any corporate developer is expected to.<p>In the second paragraph, we have a problem of semantics. If you need to do some work in order to have a more stable, maintable and bug-free solution, it's not extra at all, just the necessary amount to avoid doing even more work in the future.<p>By planning carefully you are actually avoiding rewrites, bug hunting, failures and maintenance problems. In other words: future work. And I think that identifying the problem and its best solution from the start will always reduce the total amount of work in the long run. Always.<p>As both of us are saying, a poor solution means more work. So, someone who truly wants to do the absolute minimum amount of work required should never build a poor solution intentionally. It's not the truly lazy thing to do. They are not as lazy as us, lazy people for real, they just want to avoid work in the present  ;P<p>If you want to work less, then get the problem right and build a wonderful solution that should not present complications in the future.

A 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute[5] assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 20022008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totaled $29 billion. The study did not assess subsidies supporting nuclear energy.<p>The three largest fossil fuel subsidies were:<p>Foreign tax credit ($15.3 billion)
Credit for production of non-conventional fuels ($14.1 billion)
Oil and Gas exploration and development expensing ($7.1 billion)
The three largest renewable fuel subsidies were:<p>Alcohol Credit for Fuel Excise Tax ($11.6 billion)
Renewable Electricity Production Credit ($5.2 billion)
Corn-Based Ethanol ($5.0 billion)",1341203945

As they'd conquer places, theyd bring back gold into their economy and this would allow them to lower or eliminate taxes.  During this time of expansion they did well, and the complexity of their culture increased quite a bit, but in the end, this phase had to come to an end, and Rome was unable to sustain their economy internally. Their attempts to do so involved additional complexity and a great deal of additional attempts to regulate their way out including quantitative easing of their currency.<p>In the end, the problems were too great and the society collapsed from within, through the very process by which they expanded (greater and greater complexity of society).<p>One interesting thing I would add that Herwig Wolfram suggests is that the Western Empire was particularly poorly suited because of the concentration of wealth into fewer and fewer hands, which limited the tax base and made taxes harder to collect.<p>The Byzantine Empire listed much longer but a couple hundred years after the Roman Empire fell, they too experienced a massive simplification when faced with the Arab invasions.  They did so in a more controlled way however and survived but in doing so, Tainter suggests, transitioned from a Roman society to a medieval one.",1341203905

As an engineer I've pondered whether or not you could create enough infrastructure to create a non-spoiling product which returned enough capital to move the rest. So in the grain situation you might create a simple distillery which produced grain alcohol, which was sold to cover the cost of moving excess grain to locations where it could be used. Grain alcohol has a number of used and it doesn't spoil, further processing grain into alcohol is a relatively self sufficient process (you can use the alcohol produced to run the distiller and still get net positive output.) It of course presumes free grain.<p>One of the more curious social effects I've witnessed is that someone will dump grain which is too expensive to move, but they are less willing to simply give it to you for your distillery. They note you're getting an economic benefit from their grain (which is true) but they are unwilling to build their own distillery and capture that value but still won't cede the value to someone who does that original investment.",1341203619

Our economy has grown since then but the rest of the world has too.  We are down to half our percentage of energy use, and this is a general proxy for economic activity.  So we are growing but developing nations are growing faster.  Additionally we re incredibly dependent on oil to the extent that it would be a fair summary to say that the main job of the US armed forces is to protect international oil supply.<p>So the US isn't about to drastically collapse, but the role in the world is declining and will continue to decline.

In total they raised a couple million, in the low to mid single digits.  Part was equity and part debt financing, which was all paid back and some of the equity was also bought back from investors who wanted out after the lawsuits.<p>Grooveshark was completely self sufficient for a long time, even with the lawyer bills.  What really killed it was the pressure from labels to get them kicked off ad networks, mobile app stores (first Apple, then Google), and prevent the more lucrative direct ad deals you need to really survive. Once the summary judgement occurred is when it really started becoming impossible.<p>Disclaimer I was an early employee that worked there for 5 years.",1430733581

Those are going down and are becoming competitive for many parts of the world, but costs will be prohibitive for some climates for quite a while. For example, if you have lots of snow and strong winds in winter, you may need to have _weeks_ of power storage to get reliable power.<p>Keeping a grid connection for those cases will help, but if lots of people do this, the price of power in those peak periods may surge a lot as your electricity supplier will have to recoup the costs of keeping its plant on standby year round in a few weeks.<p>That seems fixable by connecting solar/wind systems over large distances, but we have to work on getting a grid that is fed by thousands of suppliers and in which the direction power flows can vary more.<p>But yes, I think solar and wind are the future and even the near future, even in the less sunny parts of the world.",1430732773

Not in functional<p>There is a direct correspondance between Haskell code and machine code.  GHC translates from Haskell into an imperative language called C--, which is basically a restricted subset of C.  Sure, the translation is of a different style than you are used to in the imperative world, but it&#x27;s still a direct translation.<p>> 2 - Sometimes you want side-effects, in ways you didn&#x27;t know they were side effects (like writing/reading a file, random numbers, etc). Now Haskell&#x27;s way of solving this may be mathematically elegant, but it&#x27;s clunky in real life.<p>Arguably, but after several years with Haskell I now find unrestricted side-effects &quot;clunky&quot; and effect typing much more practical.<p>> 3 - Doing things functionally require a different mindset.

Brief Intro: I am an experienced remote iOS engineer with a knack for bringing
ideas either written or discussed verbally into reality through an app. I have
a strong design sense where I actually create art with Sketch and Illustrator.
I’m focused on providing five-star user experiences through carefully tuned
animations and thoughtful layout. I’m also into minimizing crashes and
maximizing performance where I brought significant improvements to these areas
in the latest app I worked on over the past five App Store releases. My
background is in developing data-driven apps so I understand the value of
efficient queries and careful modeling. I take pleasure in solving the
numerous problems that pop up during any given development cycle without
requiring additional assistance. I also know Unix inside and out so I’d be
perfectly at home on AWS or a similar platform.<p>My PDF resume/CV is at <a href=""http://goo.gl/KeetM7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/KeetM7</a>.<p>I will promptly reply to all inquiries submitted to <a href=""http://ikiapps.com/contact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ikiapps.com/contact</a>.<p>Thanks for reading this and I look forward to hearing from you soon!",1430731801

9485061,comment,9484757,9484855,0,0,bencoder,,,"> you should probably use === by default.<p>unfortunately this can also backfire if your class/module is used in a different context where it gets strings instead of integers and you were just using === without really thinking about it:<p>We had a case where the code was something like:<p><pre><code>  function doSomething($value) {
    if ($value === 0) {
      //do something
    } else {
      //do something else
    }
  }
</code></pre>
This was then used in a slighly different context where $value was a string &#x27;0&#x27;, it then ended up incorrectly in the //do something else block, doing the completely wrong thing. In this case the type co-erced == would have been better, and I think what the developer was expecting would be a type error due to the === but it&#x27;s not a type error, it&#x27;ll just fall into the else block.",1430730129

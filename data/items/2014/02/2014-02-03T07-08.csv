Unless you are exceptionally brilliant at learning new language, no matter how much you push yourself, you will be barely good enough to even know the rudimentary concept of programming in 2-3 months.<p>To me the best way to learning programming is to make fuckton worth of crude programs and then make insanely silly and sometimes good mistakes in the process and then try to figure out how to fix those mistakes by yourself (or at least with some help).<p>2-3 months is barely enough time to understand _WELL_ rudimentary concepts of programming let alone learn from your mistakes.<p>If you already have prior programming knowledge and know at least one programming language, joining this camp is silly and it doesn&#x27;t prove anything one way or another. If you already know one programming language, learning a new language should be fairly easier than for someone who have never programmed in his life.",1391414386

It&#x27;s anecdotal, but even after 1 year+ spent working as a programmer lots of hand-holding still involved. More so than a typical &quot;junior&quot; hire that went through uni + internships.<p>I was originally keen on the idea of bootcamp hires because I&#x27;ve tutored a good number of people over the years but I&#x27;m beginning to see that it&#x27;s closer to O&#x27;Reilly Cookbooks than SICP.<p>Edit: To be more topical, while I&#x27;m generally irritated by anything that could be perceived as nanny-state brigading I have a hard time working up any froth on behalf the bootcamps after the experiences I&#x27;ve had with their students.<p>Possible biases: didn&#x27;t go to uni, self-taught programmer, some class-based baggage.",1391414337

You&#x27;d think this was an easy task and you&#x27;d be right except it was quite a pain in the rear to maintain the extension. Google kept changing the classes and IDs, and moved the DOM around so frequently (sometimes within hours of the previous change) that my extension was constantly broken, and all my time was spent tweaking my code to keep pace with the changes propagating from an entire team of Googlers and their automated commit bots. It wasn&#x27;t long before I gave up on the effort.<p>Following front-end trends today feels exactly like that experience; there&#x27;s a whole host of prolific authors, even teams, coming up with new approaches for almost every nut and bolt in the stack.

Everyone in the valley wants experienced developers but they seem to be in short supply these days.

In 1997, the rage was VB and lots of cottage companies set up and advertising custom ActiveX widgets, on the web one had to learn ColdFusion and HTML/CSS. In early 2000&#x27;s, VB6 was retired in favor of .net and a painful migration/learning-curve followed. Meanwhile, PHP was gaining traction so as a front-end person, one had to also start learning the LAMP stack in addition to asp and also CSS hacks to get different browsers to render mocks. Then around 2005ish is when AJAX/Web2.0 started gaining traction, one suddenly had to learn the burgeoning frameworks of the time, jQuery/Mootools/Prototype/Dojo/YUI/Sencha (at the time, no one knew which framework was going to win. I spent a lot of time on Dojo before moving to jQuery which started to gain the most traction); at the same time, web sockets still wasn&#x27;t secure enough so there was also a lot of demand for Flex/Flash/Silverlight. Then around 2008-2009, when HTML5 started becoming more popular, Flex/Silverlight became obsolete; JS mobile frameworks such as PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile grew in favor but later in 2010-2011, they fell out of favor due to &quot;responsive design&quot; frameworks such as Bootstrap. Not to mention native mobile tech stack such as iOS and Android. In addition, around the same time, next-gen JS MVC built on top of jQuery have popped up such as Backbone.js, AngularJS and Ember.js and it&#x27;s not certain who is going to win out this time in the year of 2014. On top of those, there are now JS AMD loaders (Require.js) and build/integration tools, Grunt that one needs to set up for a project which it seems may also be falling out of favor. Finally, new video/sound/web-socket standards revolving around HTML5 standards is demanding new learning bandwidth.<p>I&#x27;m frankly overwhelmed of learning and being exposed to new technologies. The physical draining feeling of learning new keywords to fulfill the same urges is as if I have watched 15 years of porn following from the grainy days of Jenna Jameson on VHS to the heady-days of Internet dial-up gonzo porn of the early 2000&#x27;s that really explored anal (Gauge, Taylor Rain) to the streaming flash videos of Web 2.0 (Sasha Grey) to the now completely splintered and social-mediafied porno-world with all the mind-numbing categories under the sun (reality, high-art, webcam etc). I&#x27;m simply drained and spent.<p>There certainly has been changes in the field in back-end, from Java applets to Spring and Struts to now Scala and Clojure on JVM or transitioning the scripting language from Perl to Python, and adoption of Boost in C++. But I didn&#x27;t have to re-learn old concepts and the changes were incremental instead of revolutionary; and the whole shift from declarative programming to functional languages is not new as you&#x27;ve learned Haskell/Lisp in undergrad anyways. Whereas what I had learned as a 9 year old on Turbo C doing DOS programming would still apply today, what I learned then for VB4 and HTML/Frontpage is now completely useless.<p>I&#x27;m scared for my brain as I get older as I may not have the time nor the energy to devote myself every year to relearn all of these new tech. I&#x27;m wondering for people who are above the age of 30, how do you deal with it?",1391412048

That means that virtually all recent UNIX software has been either been tested on the Mac, or written on one. That's nice.</i><p>Sorry to rain on your parade but both of these statements are wrong.",1245063551
658223,comment,657647,657647,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"I think this is just unnatural. Seriously. I mean, working hard and studying hard is really great, but there must be a balance. Having rest once a fortnight and having 9-hours exams is clearly off-balance. There's a limited amount of information the nervous system can take in in a given amount of time. Studying twice as much doesn't mean learning twice as much - having spent five years in higher education I can tell that having rest and being calm helps waaay much more than, say for instance, studying on Sundays.<p>As for the Chinese society, I'm not sure if that helps them either. Sure they might raise professionals with a large lexical knowledge (assuming that they don't forget everything the moment they put the pens down at the end of the exam) but it seems to me that these millions of kids will grow up becoming real stresspots with all the divorce stuff and heart attack in their late forties. Is this really how Chinese people imagine their next generation of working population?",1245063295

This has been written about a bunch, the earliest known piece I've read notes of was by Ibn Khaldun. Some of his work is outdated, being 800 years old, but there's some pretty incredibly insightful things in it.

658212,comment,658099,658202,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"It's not just party politics though. It's the predilection of people to form up into groups and to identify with those groups even at the expense of logic and reason. Party politics is just what you get when you do it at a national level. It happens all the time all around you.",1245062182

658209,comment,658099,658099,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is good -- Eliezer? How come it took so long for this to get on the board? Great article.<p>I thought this at first was a politics article, but for me, at least, it's a much more practical one. Let me explain.<p>Working with large corporations, I've found that this is not restricted to sports or politics. It happens between divisions, between business groups -- even between cliques of programmers on the same team. Politics is the ultimate generalization of the problem, but it's a much more practical and immediate matter.<p>I guess that's why I've never understood the fear of talking about politics on HN. Heck -- you guys do it all the time. Every time there's an Apple vs. Microsoft thread, or a Twitter vs. Blogging thread, or a functional programming vs. imperative programming thread -- this is the same thing. It's amazing people can't see it. You identify with a product, a brand, a group of people, and then suddenly it's <i>us versus them</i>. We have our experts, our slogans, our information sources. They have theirs. We can argue for years and never do more than talking past each other, because <i>we've never generalized the type of discussion we are having and worked at the meta level.</i><p>Where I think politics is more interesting is that <i>positions change month by month</i>. That means that political party X may support something this month and be against it the next month. In effect, it's a critical thinking test -- can you identify your own bias? Because if you were arguing for something last month and are arguing against the same thing this month, you might be identifying more with a group that ideas. <i>It's much easier to spot this when the positions keep changing</i>, which makes a discussion of politics useful for detecting personal bias.<p>BTW, it's also a quick test for thinking about other things too. If you're meeting with a new person and they seem stuck on some political party thing, you can bet they're going to be group-identifying with a lot of other things as well. Different people have different levels of the need-to-identify. We all know the worst ones: the people with bumper stickers all over their car, various flag pins or whatever on their clothes, a rabid sports fan and a sticking-to-a-political-party-no-matter-what attitude.<p>Solutions to the two-party swindle? Term limits (to prevent camping out in office) Expiration limits for laws (to prevent get-what-you-can-now-attitude). Some sort of push for a multi-party system.<p>Oddly enough, in the US at least the thought was that it would end up being a dynamic system with small groups taking various positions and coalitions changing over time. Instead that's not how it worked out.<p>Solutions to the group-identification problem? Simple. Learn to talk about tough topics with each other.",1245061914
658208,comment,658099,658099,0,0,lionhearted,,,"At one point, I started making a list of all the decisions politicians could make and change about the way governments were run. I came up with over 100 items, very quickly. The Democrats and Republicans both didn't address and were in implicit agreement on some 95 of those 100 things, despite the fact that some of them are really ugly. For instance, the exclusive rights to the television broadcast spectrum are sold without auction for $100,000 per year to NBC, CBS, and ABC, and estimates have placed the worth of those rights over a billion dollars per year.<p>This made me sad.",1245061826
658207,comment,657098,658109,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Couple of basic factual errors:<p>Google Chrome <i>is</i> shipping Theora/Vorbis. They ship it as well as H.264 in Chrome, but without H.264 in Chromium (as they can't licence the patents).<p>Opera has had Theora/Vorbis supporting builds for a while. It seems very likely they will go with Theora when they launch full support.<p>Note also that Xiph Qicktime codecs allow Safari to use Theora as well. These codecs should just intsall from the net when you encounter such a file, but while we wait for Apple to get around to that they could easily be piggy backed onto one of the many pieces you need to install to get all video working well on Mac OS X (Perian, VLC, mplayer, or even Mozilla Firefox)<p>It may only be mediocre or ""good enough"", but it is ""free"". If you don't understand the importance of that to the web then congratulations on your lack of ""ideology"".<p>Or maybe letting some random corporations place a tax a vital part of our technical infrastructure in return for marginal technical benefits <i>is</i> an ideology, just not a very good one?",1245061594

I understand that no single person can fix this all by themselves, but is there some kind of action that we can take, when the circumstances arise, that will help resolve this problem rather than help perpetuate it?<p>Edit: Additional note... this is one of the many reasons I like the Swiss system. We vote on issues separately from voting on people. This has its disadvantages, but at least it's direct democracy.",1245060474
658199,comment,657895,657941,0,0,aufreak,,,"I agree. Moreover, I think it would have been useful to measure variables indicating emotional state as the affirmation is uttered. If you feel crippled when you utter ""I'm a lovable person"", chances are your subconscious is saying ""no you're not"". It is also known that jumping from ""Nobody loves me"" to ""I'm lovable"" isn't possible for the most. You need to take small steps, each of which needs to be coupled with a better feeling.",1245060377

Online dating preys upon a somewhat already-desperate userbase.<p>But it's also genius how they deal with the e-mail problem.  For example, with Ok Cupid, they include a giant one-click ""Login"" link with e-mail updates.  There's no password re-entry.  With other sites, they send you just enough information about a connection that makes you want to sign back in again, but not enough information to let you contact that other person directly via e-mail.",1245060257

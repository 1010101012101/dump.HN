6204690,comment,6202436,6203999,2,0,WalterBright,,,"I understand fractional reserve banking. It&#x27;s a percentage (I think around 10%) of the deposits the government requires a bank to keep on hand. The rest of the deposits are all loaned out back into the economy.<p>Note that the government requires this reserve because otherwise the bank will loan it out, i.e. the bank doesn&#x27;t actually desire to keep cash on hand. Neither do rich people. Even drug lords don&#x27;t want cash hoards, it&#x27;s why they launder it.<p>It&#x27;s not splitting hairs over semantics. People who have money in the bank do not have a cash hoard that they are withholding from the economy.<p>As far as people keeping assets in safety deposit boxes, nobody has any idea how much is in them, so it&#x27;s rather pointless to talk about them. I do find it hard to believe that Apple&#x27;s billions in &quot;cash&quot; is really a hoard in a safety deposit box that&#x27;s withheld from the economy.<p>>that is a working, popular, valid definition of &quot;hoarding cash&quot;.<p>Not in the sense we are discussing of it being withheld from the economy.<p>(For fun, watch Breaking Bad, where one of Heisenberg&#x27;s biggest problems is trying to convert cubic feet of cash into something he can spend.)",1376384364

Reusing them is a security risk and not recommended (recent android vulnerability is a good example - it only affected reused addresses). Every transaction done with the standard client usually creates a new address (to send the change), which is not even visible in the interface. Merchants accepting Bitcoin usually create a new address for each invoice, etc. etc.<p>In other words, the way Bitcoin is used is fundamentally incompatible with the public declaration of addresses. If the government has the power to change this, it might as well make Bitcoin completely illegal and not bother.",1376384093

6204640,story,,,3,12,zrz,"Ask HN: A high level language that compiles to VBA ?",,"I don&#x27;t have a lot of background in computer science (4 years), but it seems to me that recently, we saw some new languages coming alive.I just heard of Elixir which is built on top of the Erlang VM. Scala is a little bit older (2003) and targets JAVA VM. Clojure(2007) targeting JAVA VM and being compilable to javascript, seems to be a really clever move.<p>Javascript rising popularity have triggered the rise of transpilers that targets that language.<p>My point is that designing high level language that transpiles to another seems to be a pretty active field. I guess that tools to do so have evolved in the recent history (I actually would be interested to know about the state of the art, any resources are very welcome). Leveraging an existing platform by adding concept-comprehension at the syntactic level (i&#x27;m thinking of list comprehension, for example) seems to add productivity at no cost, no trade-off (?)<p>OK now, the real topic.<p>In my opinion, VBA is as annoying to write as it is present in the industry. A lot of companies rely on it (I&#x27;m working in the financial industry, so mainly VBA for Excel).<p>A lot of people uses VBA, a lot of people already have that tool, and struggle to use it,and still use it. VBA allows you to do what you want to do, but I don&#x27;t think it is optimal to directly write VBA.<p>I think of it as a telegraph line: the network is already there, Morse code allows you to write anything you want, but it a PITA to work with. Build a tool that automatically encodes and decodes what&#x27;s on the channel and you&#x27;re on the internet (OK, oversimplifying here).<p>Can&#x27;t we put excitement back in VBA technology by hiding it ? I&#x27;m sure we have tools to make it happen.<p>I really would love to have developer&#x27;s opinion on that. If you think that nobody has ever been that wrong, please include enlightenments.",1376383353

The version tagging thing is only intended to be used when you start depending on a new language feature not available in older versions of Go.

This is instead of the last five years of taxes that you would normally be required to do. You would only need to actually pay taxes if you are over ~90K USD a year and don&#x27;t have enough foreign tax credits to cover it.<p>To be able to actually file the taxes you need a SSN. You can get this by going to a consulate or embassy, bringing the proper original documentation (get in touch with them for the details). They will make certified copies, mail those up the chain until it gets to the state department and 3-6 months later you will have your SSN.<p>For actually doing the taxes one option is to pay someone to do it. You still end up doing a lot of prep-work yourself, so you are basically paying to some peace at mind that they&#x27;ve signed of on things being correct.<p>If you go for a renunciation, the date you renounce is the date your tax obligation ends, this has recently changed and not all tax accounts, even the ones that specialize in expats seem to know this. This means you might end up with renouncing before you have a SSN, and thus your taxes in order, so look into the laws and/or ask an expert before deciding how to handle this.<p>Last bit is figuring out exit taxes, there the tax accountants seem to be useless as it makes no sense for them to specialize in one time customers. But it seems they will happily charge you for looking over and sanity checking the form once you fill it out.<p>You can also forget calling the IRS and getting any help about renunciations, they consider such matters &quot;advanced&quot; and will only tell you to get a lawyer and/or tax accountant.<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20130626160026/http://www.renunciationguide.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20130626160026/http://www.renunci...</a> used to have a very comprehensive coverage of the renunciation process, but seems to have disappeared :(<p>As for how to proceed, and what makes sense to do is a highly personal matter and depends on so many things.

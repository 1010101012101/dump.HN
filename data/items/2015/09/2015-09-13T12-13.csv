As I understand it, to an outside observer a shell behaves gravitationally identically to a point mass at the centre of such a shell would.<p>> Of course, I&#x27;m no doubt very wrong, but whenever I&#x27;ve mentioned this to anyone, no one has really come up with anything to say it absolutely isn&#x27;t possible, not without holding on to other things we &#x27;think&#x27; we know like matter &#x27;should&#x27; continue to collapse to infinite density once past some arbitrary point. Something I&#x27;m not convinced is true.<p>Sure, you can model the external gravitational field as a shell of mass (interior to the event horizon), but they you have to explain why the mass is in a shell, rather than collapsing in on itself. If black holes form as the remnant of the cores of massive stars, then there&#x27;s no shell configuration to start out with, so now you also have to explain why a shell forms in addition to it is maintained. So, while the shell model may be consistent with the external gravitational field, it seems to be constructed in an ad hoc fashion.<p>Also, not everyone thinks matter should collapse to infinite density, e.g., [0]. I don&#x27;t have enough domain knowledge to say how reasonable that particular model is. But &quot;collapsing to infinite density&quot; is a simple explanation for non-experts, but I don&#x27;t think physicists are comfortable with it as an actual interpretation. The more common interpretation is that the laws of physics we have do not apply in such situations, and we need an understanding of quantum gravity to say what happens at the center of a black hole.<p>[0] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0506111"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0506111</a>",1442148876

I only saw examples of it for code that tightly integrates with the host hardware (e.g. directly uses drivers of some uncommon hardware devices) or other similar scenarios, where you generally don&#x27;t have other choice but use native libraries.<p>I think main reasons for this are platform independence and ease of building/packaging/deployment.

How annoying! Bitcoin lets me pay my landlord without problems because no one is here to tell me how much of my own money I am allowed to spend.<p>I am not saying that I want to use Bitcoin for every single transaction, eg. paying my lunch at the restaurant, but for certain types of needs like the two examples above, Bitcoin is very useful.",1442147263

You might be able to block a few image URLs for a while, but the ad industry will quickly migrate to any technique that has has a real effect of bypassing ad-blockers.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think the opaque nature of WebAssembly will defeat ad blockers because advertisers depend on the <i>distributed infrastructure</i> of the internet and that aspect stays the same whether browsers execute plain-text Javascript, or obfuscated minified Javascript,  or obfuscated WebAssembly.  Many (most?) obnoxious ads depend on <i>ad networks</i> to constantly generate realtime contextual ads for a particular web surfer.  They also require the ad network for behavior tracking and monetizing.  Therefore, fetching these external resources (urls) to &quot;build the ad&quot; will always be transparent to browsers engines and if they continue to provide &quot;hooks&quot; for ad blockers to detect these GETs, the filters will continue to be effective.<p>Another way to put it... there are 3 separate entities collaborating to deliver realtime ads: (1) content provider (2) the ad distrib network (3) the advertisers ... and following Conway&#x27;s Law[1], the code snippets executed and fetched by the browser engine will mimic those business boundaries.  That structure can always be detected by ad blockers.<p>On the other hand, if the ad is deeply &quot;embedded&quot; inside of content such as Fox Studios embedding a Pepsi ad for a XMen movie such that it&#x27;s a contiguous chunk of WebAssembly, or continuous stream of &quot;frames&quot; for <canvas>, then yes, it will be harder to detect such &quot;native advertising&quot;[2].  In my mind, this scenario is closer to the &quot;halting problem&quot;.  This type of advertising doesn&#x27;t appear to be the majority because the content providers don&#x27;t like to burn their servers&#x27; CPU and network bandwidth &quot;pre-assembling&quot; the embedded ad before delivery.  They&#x27;d rather take advantage of ad networks to make the cpu+network on users&#x27; desktops/iPhones assemble the ads on-the-fly.<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law</a><p>[2]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_advertising"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_advertising</a>",1442146147

In my opinion it accurately describes a problem, but then totally fumbles on the reason and the solutions.<p>The real reasons are described by narrator and kephra in this comment thread. They&#x27;ve got to do with how land is scarce and getting scarcer, and how banks leverage the demand almost without risk and in perpetuity. If you don&#x27;t really get the economics of it, it comes down to this: property owners negotiate with you one (important) aspect of your life (where/how you live) for a percentage of <i>all</i> income you <i>ever</i> make. Imagine the scale of that nationally, it&#x27;s really not surprising to learn that property is the largest share of income for capital.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about this reason a lot since I&#x27;ve started reading Piketty and perhaps more so now I&#x27;m looking to buy a house in one of those super scarce places. An interesting point Piketty makes at some point that this form of capitalism is fundamentally un-American, or at least, against the idea of the U.S. in its forming years, but you&#x27;ll have to read the book for that. I promise you he&#x27;s not a socialist ;)<p>The solution that came to me, even though it would screw me if it were implemented, is capping mortgages even stronger. In the Netherlands we are moving to a 100% home value cap in the coming few years, and gave them a max duration of 30 years, that fixes one side of it. But it should also enforce lower limits on mortgage relative to salary.<p>Perhaps those values are already closer to what&#x27;s right in The Netherlands than they are elsewhere. In Amsterdam you pay 220k for a small 2-bedroom apartment or small house on the edges, which costs you about 35% of your income (if you maxed out).<p>Those regulations give way to another problem though, and that&#x27;s rent. They definitely should be regulated the same way. At the moment that same apartment in Amsterdam rents for about 1300, almost twice to what a mortgage would cost. And I know for a fact that people who aren&#x27;t allowed the mortgage do rent those places instead, that&#x27;s just draining capital.<p>Maybe some (amateur) economist can poke a hole in my plan (reduce mortgages and rents through regulations). I have a feeling there is a right level of regulation that will make mortgages comfortably profitable for banks without it squandering the publics spending power.",1442146075

28694,comment,28610,28685,0,0,mojuba,,,"I can see how MS is screwed up from the pieces of their code that are open, which can be extrapolated to the pieces of code that are closed.<p>Unfortunately Adobe follows their path now, and even trying to beat MS in producing bloated code. Photoshop, Dreamweaver and even Acrobat Reader will soon become unmaintainable monsters. Otherwise, how can one explain that a dozen of unimpressive new features in the new version makes the package twice as bigger?",1182102419

Basically, I built something that I wanted to use as there was nothing exactly similar to SansJ.Thanks to your comments, it is going to be better.",1182100034

It's really that simple. :)<p>In all seriousness, if you _do_ marry an American, it is very likely that the US government/immigration service (now dba Dept. of Homeland Security) will forgive any extended but unauthorized stay in the US, AND give you a EAC (employment authorization card), followed immediately by a (SSN and) Green Card.<p>If you don't want to marry an American, you need to typically have some serious a) connections, b) money, c) credentials, and/or d) accomplishments under your belt.<p>In lieu of those, you need an attractive American employer who has one or more of the above-noted qualities. ;)<p>Please correct me if I am mistaken in any of these assertions...

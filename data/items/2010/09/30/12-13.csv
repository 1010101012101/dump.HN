Alice connects a stochastic voltage generator and a resistor in series to each of the two wires. That's the setup.</i><p><i>Here's how they communicate. At each clock tick, both Alice and Bob randomly choose one of their two resistors and put it in the circuit. Then, Alice and Bob both measure the current flowing through the circuit. Basically, it's inversely proportional to the sum of their two chosen resistors: 20 ohms, 1,010 ohms or 2,000 ohms. Of course, the eavesdropper can measure the same thing.</i><p><i>If Alice and Bob choose the same size resistor, then the eavesdropper knows what they have chosen, so that clock tick is useless for security. But if they choose a different size resistor, the eavesdropper cannot tell whether it is Alice choosing 10 ohms and Bob 1,000 ohms, or the reverse. Of course, Alice and Bob know, because they know which resistor they're choosing. This happens 50 percent of the time.\nAlice and Bob keep only the data from the clock ticks where they choose a different size resistor. From each such clock tick, they can derive one secret key bit, according to who chooses the 10-ohm resistor and who the 1,000-ohm. That's because they know who's choosing which and the eavesdropper doesn't. Do it enough times and you've got key material for a one-time pad (or anything else) to encrypt the communications link.</i>",1285849721

Yes, a firmware upgrade can solve this, but this was 2009 at the time - how much more time do hardware vendors need to put this in consumer products, where we'll see arguably the most pain (in terms of hand-holding service requirements)?<p>Also, relating to screens, a huge number (large majority?) of software is coded specifically to the dotted-quad format.  I think we'd have seen more adoption if the plan we're migrating to had simply added a couple more dots to it.  Easier for people to think about at the end, and would have given us a moderately larger pool base, easier way of thinking about new address spaces (visually, I mean).<p><i>64.27.</i>78.45.134.240 where you tell people that the first two (or last two) now correspond to new addresses, and 'old' addressed simply have two leading 0s, would have made transition easier to swallow (IMHO).<p>2001:0f68:0000:0000:0000:0000:1986:69af, in comparison, even if shortened down, looks pretty alien.<p>Adding two dotted quads would have given us 65k x 4 billion addresses.  Yes, it's not IPv6-sized, I know.  But in terms of the 'let's measure everything by how many IPs each person on the planet can have!' it would have been sufficient for a while - I think most people would be fine with fewer than 20k addresses each.<p>I know this is wholly naive of me, and real hackers everywhere can do this stuff in their sleep.  However, 'real hackers' aren't going to be dealing with the majority of this transition - it's going to be average joes trying to help their family get back on the internet over the phone after they mistype something on their new DLINK-950v6 router from Best Buy.<p>We're well past the phase where we can back out, or I think even consider alternatives, but the impact to existing software screens is not to be underestimated.<p>IPv6 may turn out to be the real Y2k.",1285849436

Maybe they don't comment because it's recycled material.<p>2. Posterous allows up to 100 entries per screen, so I just set mine at the max.  It's only text and almost everyone should have broadband by now, so it loads fast.  Why would anyone set this lower?<p>3.

They can also connect with people who share the same enthusiasm for those sports, and therefore organise, find and enjoy to a new level there favourite sport!<p>Principle :\nSport-Tribe is organized in ""Tribes"". A tribe = one SPORT in one COUNTRY.\nEach tribe has a specific landing page, search page, member page etc..\nExample : http://www.sport-tribe.com/en-GB/gliding/France<p>Business Model :\nToday, Sport-Tribe is still a very young company, and we haven't started any commercial business, but focus on increasing traffic and interest for our website. To date, we haven't generated any money. In a near future, we intend to sell advert spaces to advertisers, and develop Affiliate programs with sport-related activities.<p>We have divided Sport-Tribe into sport+country (tribes) in order to simplify the marketing and to do business in a more focused way, with specific and targeted markets (per tribe).<p>For each tribe that has (or will have) enough traffic, we will find a sponsor/affiliate program relative to the sport+country and display specifics adverts about them.<p>Example: http://www.sport-tribe.com/en-GB/gliding/France : see AirContact at the bottom. (note: We use BanManPro to manage adverts.) AirContact is a dedicated journal for Aero sports in France.<p>Roadmap:\n  1) Our first concern today is to find a way to fill up the database with all clubs information for the tribes. We have 2 solutions to this problem :\n    a. Enter each and every clubs by hand\n    b. Send an email presenting the Sport-Tribe to all clubs of a tribe, and expect a registration from them.\n  2) When we have full tribes (or with already enough information), we will market these tribes to bring more traffic to them, increasing overall traffic to the website.\n  3) Finally we will find paying advertisers for theses tribes.<p>Thank you very much for your comments.<p>PS: I have copied this request to other business-websites to have more opinions.

29068,comment,29058,29058,0,0,elq,,,"to this list I can add a few more reasons: A fairly strong potential for financial ruin; an amazing amount of personal drama; and deep strain on friendships among the founders.<p>After my last (also my first) company failed - my credit was heavily damaged (and after nearly 4 years it has yet to fully recover), repaying debt can take quite a long time (I spent the last 3.5 years working at a well paying corp job and I was only able to fully settle the debt early last year), and due to bad advice from a (very) expensive accountant the IRS was a thorn in my side for 2.5 years.<p>But, I'm about to do it again as the experience is amazing and a _fantastic_ education.",1182218263

29066,comment,28830,29062,0,0,paul,,,"It's funny that you mention the economist, because I used to feel the same way about them, but then a few years ago they published some article about Google that was full of errors.<p>Clearly the old model isn't working though. I think the solution must be collaborative. I don't know if Thoof is it, but at least it's in the right direction.",1182217449
29065,comment,28703,28726,0,0,euccastro,,,"You can harm someone indirectly through the in-game economy.<p>Out-of-game virtual goods trading can kill meaning of progress in a game- whether there was much meaning to begin with is another debate.<p>This economic link between worlds breaks the ""magic circle"" that separates game from real life. This can hurt or kill the experience of a game, depending on how much it relies on suspension of disbelief. Then again, this also opens opportunities to explore, both in game/experience design and in business.",1182217198

29062,comment,28830,28999,0,0,weel,,,"There is a traditional solution to this, in theory. The theory goes that a newspaper will meticulously edit and fact check, because at some point, they are bound to write about something I happen to know a lot about, and then if they are wrong, I will no longer trust them on other things. Unfortunately, the theory works a little too well: virtually all newspapers, if you read a few issues cover to cover, contain enough errors about things that you happen to know a lot about that you start mistrusting them. But there are a few publications for which traditional solution seems to work. I have rarely found any mistakes in The Economist, for instance, when they write about things I happen to know a lot about, which leads me to trust them more than most other news sources when it comes to things I don't know.",1182217028

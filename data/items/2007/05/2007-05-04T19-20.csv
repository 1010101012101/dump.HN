I've been waiting patiently for months, but I've been unable to get an EC2 account.  If anyone has a spare, I'd really appreciate it - I can be contacted at palish@gmail.com.  I'd be happy to give whatever you'd like in exchange for one.<p>Thanks a lot friends, I really appreciate it.

People develop in their own branches of the code, and them when features are ready, we merge back into the Trunk.<p>We have a machine (actually a VM) check the code for revisions, and when there is a checkin, it downloads it from svn (cvs should be similar), and then builds, and uploads.<p>You could do jUnit tests, etc at the same point, to ensure that everything is in sync.<p>It's not exactly identical, but take a look at <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000023.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000023.html</a><p>Joel points out some good reasons why build machines can really help.<p>-Colin

19493,comment,19446,19446,0,0,sri,,,"Everyone should read Mindset by Carol Dweck <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck/dp/1400062756"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck/dp/1400062756</a>    <p>I think that it is a very important book. It is like a self-help book -- without the fluff and with science behind it. It talks about ""growth-oriented mindset"" (who focus on learning) versus ""fixed mindset"" (who think that intelligence is a fixed thing). And most people have both mindsets in different areas. And main point is you can change your mindset and what a difference that makes: you aren't afraid of looking bad (for a fixed mindset person, looking bad will amount to ""i'm stupid"", ""i don't have it""). But for a growth minded person, looking bad simply means that they haven't put in the necessary time/effort to get better.<p>This is why you should never praise a child's intelligence. Eventually the child will think that ""I was born with this talent"" and will stop putting in the effort, and will become stuck -- that is, they were prodigies while growing up. But now, as an adult, they haven't progressed any further.<p>
A really great book!!

This is purely me getting sick of waiting tables and having to clock in, having a fixed work schedule, etc. and wanting to utilize my coding skills to build a passive income engine. I&#x27;m an aspiring actor and need all the free time I can get to attend auditions and be on the film set on shooting days.<p>I started and still run a daily deal platform (basically Shopify for Groupon clone sites) that made me sufficient passive income (~$1.5k/mo) for a number of years, and I had a blast just travelling, chilling, playing video games, hosting parties, etc. from 2012-2014 while my bills get paid. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m really unwilling to work on the idea anymore, and the market is shrinking I believe, and revenue is suffering now. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m disinterested because it&#x27;s not growing anymore, or it&#x27;s not growing anymore because I&#x27;m disinterested.

And they have pretty much won. SEO was a hot industry just a few years ago, and is already disappearing.<p>And social media specialization of marketing and PR was taken on by very young people and thought to be a special skill, until recently. But already businesses have figured out that there is nothing special about it. And every marketer is expected to be a social media expert.

It&#x27;s not exactly wrong, it&#x27;s just an intellectually lazy argument to make.<p>Just one example of this time it&#x27;s different is the income split between labor and capital. Historically it had been fixed at 70/30. This is across all industries, and all nations, since the industrial revolution. But now labor&#x27;s share is down to just 62%. And that&#x27;s happening in places like China and Mexico too, so it can&#x27;t be simply due to offshoring.

The economies of countries like China and India, which realized on a lot of textile production, collapsed when the industrial revolution took off in the UK. The UK exported both goods and unemployment. And what we call the 3rd world was brought into existence. We are seeing a very similar process today with Germany and the Southern belt of the EU.

9117694,comment,9117028,9117028,0,0,EGreg,,,"Angular touted its declarative syntax, but really what does that give you? It saves a few strokes over something like<p><pre><code>  <div>Hey, <span class=&quot;myapp-name&quot; /> how are you!</div>\n</code></pre>\nAnd then in your javascript:<p><pre><code>  controller.onStateChanged(&quot;name&quot;).set(function () {\n    $(&quot;.myapp-name&quot;, container).html(state.name);\n  });\n</code></pre>\nThe latter is more explicit and also declarative. It also gives you a lot more flexibility and is much more efficient than dirty-checking.<p>React kind of encourages building the components the second way. It eschews two-way binding in favor of a code-based rendering approach. IoC pattern isn&#x27;t the same as embracing a declarative style where static data contains instructions.<p>So, React is more efficient and mitigates the code-based rendering by introducing JSX inside JS. Basically, the templates are declared inside your JS files. Same as in Angular you&#x27;d have directives.<p>But then the question becomes, why do you need to do all the fancy DOM diffing, also? Just fire events when an attribute of some ViewModel changes. Attach event listeners to recompute some values and then do DOM updates using a library like FastDOM. I guess React could help in the diffing by storing copies of your DOM snippets, but that&#x27;s usually not the biggest bottleneck. You usually ALREADY store the previous state in JS and can see what changed, before rendering. With libraries like Fastdom or GSAP updates are plenty fast to the point of powering 60fps animations!",1425023248

9117669,comment,9117137,9117137,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"There&#x27;s a joke on film sets: Why don&#x27;t more Directors of Photography smoke? Because it takes 3 hours to light.<p>Typically the director chooses one or more angles for viewing the action of a scene, and then the production designer makes sure that whatever appears within the frame (wallpaper, props, furniture) looks right. Then the Director of Photography&#x27;s, or DP&#x27;s, job begins.<p>The basics of lighting involve setting up areas of light and shadow, of the kind you know if you enjoy black-and-white films. But from there, building a consistent color balance for a scene is an enormous amount of work. There are multiple different sorts of lights (incandescent, flourescent, LED, HMI), each with different color temperatures (often switched in and out within the same fitting), which are in turn modified with varying thicknesses of colored gel and which have to match the diegetic light sources - ie those which will appear on screen as part of the &#x27;story world&#x27;. Sunlight is blue. So&#x27;s moonlight, but not <i>as</i> blue - if it&#x27;s too blue then it looks like a blue light instead of a white moon. Interior lamps have their own color temperature, which usually tilts orange. Then you have to deal with multiple lights; typically there&#x27;s a key light illuminating the subject, a back light which helps to isolate the subject from the background (so the actors don&#x27;t look like they have a tree growing out of their head or something - longer lenses flatten perspective and make it hard to differentiate foreground and background at narrow apertures) and a diffused fill light to balance these more intense point sources and obscure their artificiality, without losing the selective quality of the illumination. Each of these has to be color-balanced separately. Complex scenes sometimes require 6 or seven light sources. If you&#x27;re shooting interior scenes and it&#x27;s not essential to look out the window, it&#x27;s often preferable to just black out all the windows or shoot at night, and employ artificial lights instead of the sun.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of what it takes to make a scene look &#x27;natural&#x27;: <a href=""https://plus.google.com/photos/109568505224923852682/albums/5884382003578185713/5884427087396987378?banner=pwa&pid=5884427087396987378&oid=109568505224923852682&authkey=CJbl8Ne5t7vGcQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/photos/109568505224923852682/albums/...</a> What you can&#x27;t see here is that the lower halves of the windows are covered with multiple sheets of neutral-density filter gets, gut to size (whereas the unfiltered upper parts of the window are just a glow of overexposure). that&#x27;s several hours of work before it&#x27;s even worth turning the camera on.<p>Shooting outside in sunlight should be simpler, right? Nope - you need reflectors (White? Gold? Silver? it depends), flags to take light <i>off</i> the hot spots, large silks for diffusion (which require extensive rigging to hold what is essentially a small parachute and prevent it flapping in the breeze), and people able to reliably adjust everything during the shot if the camera or the subject is moving. Also, the motion of the earth around the sub means that the position of everything needs to be tweaked about every 15 minutes as you do more takes and shoot things from different angles, all of which have to look completely consistent later on even if the source footage was shot hours apart. Also the color of the sun changes depending on the time of day.<p>Lighting for film is a massive headache most of the time* which is why you just don&#x27;t see certain clothing combinations on film. A dress like this is enough to make an industry veteran cry.<p>* unless it&#x27;s mild and overcast. Moderate cloud cover basically doubles productivity for daylight photography.",1425022827

I&#x27;ve realized that constraint for our growth is not money, rather learning and understanding what matters in business and what doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s slow and gradual learning that I&#x27;m enjoying the most.<p>Last year, I was exploring whether funding could help us grow faster. Talking to VCs and the firms that got VC funding gave me the perspective that raising funds is RARELY a one-time thing. Once you raise funding (and dilute 25-30% of your company), no VC wants that money to be sitting in your bank and earn 0% interest. So your burn rate increases exponentially and most VCs want their funding to burn within 18 months. This means that in order to sustain the company you&#x27;d have to raise the next round and dilute another 25-30% of the company, and this keeps happening until exit/IPO where the investors typically end up holding 80% of the company and pretty much controlling its destiny. And remember it was who you toiled day and night to make your dreams successful.<p>Someone who had raised funding advised me - as long as things are  going fine, you the founder are in control of the company. And if you&#x27;re not growing fast-enough (think 100% year on year), the investors are in control. It&#x27;s not that VC money is bad per-se, however, I think losing control of your company as a consequence of external funding is bad. Disruptions happen, new competitor emerges and you could be thrown out of your own company.<p>For us, having HQ in India gives us a good cost structure (although funding scene in India is changing that fast, salaries are getting through the roof) so we&#x27;ve been able to fund, reinvest profits and grow the company profitably (and have a nest egg for worst case). However, given the costs in SF / bay area, I&#x27;m not sure how would one go about bootstrapping a company for long. Would love to hear thoughts from fellow bootstrappers in high cost-of-living cities/countries?<p>PS: A bootstrapped company I really admire is Zoho. They&#x27;re 1700 people and they say they have two IPOable products within the company. Very admirable.",1425021942

So when government steps in and solves them, all pro-state individuals shout a glorious &quot;Hurray, take that free-market!!&#x27;.<p>>Seat Belts: If individuals wanted them, the car companies would have followed suit. You forget that not only were seat belts mandated to be installed, but people were FINED if they didn&#x27;t put them on.<p>>Air Bags: If there wasn&#x27;t a state, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d have safety organizations putting out reports/studies about effectiveness of air bags. Rich people would buy them in their cars, poor people wouldn&#x27;t, and they don&#x27;t do that now anyways. Not sure how you see this is as something &quot;government&quot; fixed as it&#x27;s different to seat belts, which are mandated?<p>>Fuel efficiency: Ah yes, another environmental tax meant to incentivize good behavior. Let me know how that&#x27;s working out. All this does is drive up the cost of cars unnecessarily under the pretense of environmental benefits. Again, if people wanted it, you wouldn&#x27;t have to force them to do it. This is the basic basic difference that most pro-market, and anti-market sentiments boil down to.<p>>Racial discrimination: This was enforced and perpetuated by state laws. Some would argue it still happens today with certain mandatory sentencing laws, minimum wage, etc.<p>>Taxation without representation. What? You want the market to solve a problem that solely exists because of the state, revolves around the state, and is absolutely not subject to <i>any</i> market forces at all? Perhaps if I could &quot;choose&quot; where my tax money was spent, then there would be some sort of market force driven by individuals. But that&#x27;s nowhere near the case.<p>Now, a little more on-topic. You are absolutely right that we can&#x27;t rely on the market to solve all problems, but in the presence of a state. The temptation is always there to &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;slightly nudge&quot; the market in directions <i>we</i> want it to go, rather than what the collective unconscious has decided. The free-market is more democracy than democracy is right now, and people fundamentally can not accept that.",1425021459

9117566,comment,9117028,9117028,0,0,bolinfest,,,"For context, here&#x27;s a discussion from the Atom forum that we had way back in August about the future of React in Atom:<p><a href=""https://discuss.atom.io/t/whats-the-status-of-react-in-atom/11456"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discuss.atom.io/t/whats-the-status-of-react-in-atom/...</a><p>There are a few issues in play here:<p>(1) Atom wants to support a world in which every Atom package can install whatever version of a dependency it wants, including React. This is very common in Node (incidentally, this causes problems if you want to use singletons or instanceof in Node), but fairly uncommon on the Web (where React is primarily used). That is, it&#x27;s rare that you inadvertently load multiple versions of React in your single-page application. If you did, you would likely get an error when adding one React component as a child of another React component because of the way React vends ids. (Solutions are possible, but none is employed today.)<p>From Atom&#x27;s perspective, that is a problem. The only way they can work around it is by providing &quot;one true version of React&quot; with Atom core that all packages must use, but then Atom is forcing all packages to use a particular version of React. That would violate Atom&#x27;s philosophy of letting each package choose its own dependencies.<p>(2) This is not just an issue for React, but for any UI toolkit whose components are not guaranteed to interoperate across versions. To sidestep this issue, Atom has currently decided to use the DOM API/HTML custom elements. I would call this the &quot;least common denominator approach,&quot; which satisfies Atom&#x27;s design goals, but fails to provide a higher-level abstraction for building UI in Atom. It&#x27;s a tradeoff.<p>(3) React does not currently support the shadow DOM or custom attributes, which is the new direction that Atom has chosen. As React has not yet been evicted from Atom core, I recently upstreamed a change (<a href=""https://github.com/atom/react/pull/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/atom/react/pull/1</a>) to add one-off support for Atom&#x27;s primary custom elements, <atom-text-editor mini> and <atom-panel>, in the fork of React bundled with Atom. As I develop Atom packages using babel (formerly 6to5) <a href=""http://blog.atom.io/2015/02/04/built-in-6to5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.atom.io/2015/02/04/built-in-6to5.html</a>, which has default support for JSX, building UI in React has been a lot of fun. However, the lack of support for custom attributes makes it difficult to do things like add an appropriate onChange handler to an <atom-text-editor> to update the React component&#x27;s state as shown in <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html</a>.<p>(4) React is still version 0.x.x, which means it has not yet committed to a stable API. This makes choosing a version of React to bundle with Atom an even more uncomfortable decision for the Atom team, assuming they were willing to do so in the first place.<p>None of these items implies that there is something fundamentally broken about React&#x27;s model. It just means that the React team has some work to do in order to support Atom&#x27;s use case. The performance graphs cited in the original post are also significant (and of interest to the React team), but even if the performance problems were fixed tomorrow, that alone would probably not be enough for Atom to pull React back into core right now.",1425020786

And he only compares against naked shared mutable state, not against managed mutable state with change propagation.<p>And that gets to the end of the talk: the real reason is they want to avoid using frameworks that already solve this problem by tracking changes, and React somehow avoids that since you can do just the diff post facto.

Is it people looking at the dress in person that think it looks white?<p>Someone looking at this photo on a reasonably standard (or reasonably well characterized) LCD display which their eyes have adapted to is going to pretty much see all of the three versions falling between “pale blue” and “dark blue”. Given the yellow background, proper “white balance” would make the dress look even bluer (see example below). Either way, seems like the photo was taken with a pretty bad-quality cellphone camera. Maybe people have just learned to predict color in pictures from some specific cellphone cameras with awful sensors and processing? Or maybe someone spent 20 minutes staring at something bright blue, and then switched quickly to looking at the photo?<p>What am I missing here? Does anyone here think the image makes the dress look white?<p>(Also, there’s not much “science” in this wired post at all. Edit: in response to the below comment, the businessinsider post is also pretty shoddy “science”.)<p>Edit:<p>One of the nicest online sources about this topic is <a href=""http://handprint.com/HP/WCL/color4.html#chromainduct"" rel=""nofollow"">http://handprint.com/HP/WCL/color4.html#chromainduct</a> ; the rest of that site is in general the best online source about human color vision. (There are better sources, but you’ll need to go to a university library to read them.)<p>I wouldn’t claim to be a professional color scientist, but I’m about as much an expert on this topic as you’ll ever find among amateurs. If someone wants a 3-hour lecture in person about the science of human color vision, I’d be happy to oblige (but you have to come to an SF coffeeshop for it; could also be a shorter or longer lecture, depending).<p>Here’s the original image vs. one I “white balanced” to make the obviously white & black dress in the background appear neutral. Does the foreground dress still look white + gold?<p>orig: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/g461GBr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/g461GBr.jpg</a>\n; white balanced: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/jtjECtR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/jtjECtR.jpg</a>\n(and I actually cheated a bit toward leaving the blue less intense than I would typically make it if color correcting this image)<p>In any event, I still can’t explain why people are seeing this dress as white. I now think that it’s likely to be unfamiliarity looking at digital photographs and/or some weird adaptation effect, e.g. looking at a dim phone screen while outside in the shade on a sunny day. Or maybe perception is being colored by a general expectation of white dresses (people often substitute colors in this way when they look at e.g. fire hydrants, human skin, clouds, or grass, interpreting the color based on past experience despite weird lighting conditions).",1425020422

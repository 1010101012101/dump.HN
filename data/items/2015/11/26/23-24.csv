Then I got this idea to connect my sheet-fed scanner to it and scan pages directly to Dropbox. That worked nicely. My 2nd RPi I got 2 Canon Selphy Printers and setup a gmail account where I could send pictures to. The RPi picks up the images and send them to the printers in a round-robbin fashion. ... I guess what I&#x27;m saying is the sky is the limit... So how do you follow-through? The idea needs to have some practical purpose. In my case, I use both those setups regularly.",1448582297

10635254,comment,10631668,10634410,0,0,Udo,,,"Just as a counterpoint, I have found many, many uses for Pis in my life. One is hosting my home automation software, I have built several information radiators with it, one is acting as a network-controlled media player, I even made one that acts as a faux remote control for the AC with IR diodes attached to the GPIO ports.<p>By contrast, I have several Arduino boards sitting here, and never found a good use for them. For me the appeal of the Pi lies in the combination of low energy usage, low price, networking, and comparatively high computing power. Once you get over the &quot;woah, wasting an entire computer just for [insert menial task]&quot; barrier, it&#x27;s simply incredible what this single component enables you to cook up on a whim. The Pi allows me to make things that are not yet (or will never be) available commercially.<p>However, I would not say this thing is necessarily useful for <i>all</i> hackers or nerds. It&#x27;s only useful if you have ideas for small, self-built devices that require programmable intelligence. Take note that this is also fundamentally different from the stated purpose of the Pi, as stated by its manufacturer.",1448582202

This is for a variety of reasons, including liquidity, individual opportunity costs, risks, individual lifetime (if you&#x27;re old you may be uninterested in a 20 year bet), obsolescence, etc. In the end that horizon dictates of the actions of a shareholder controlled company.<p>So if the majority of the capital [holders] on the stock market are looking for near/medium term gains, you&#x27;ll see boards that &quot;maximize shareholder value&quot; populated by those individuals. Their actions will maximize near/medium term value without much regard to long term. That the company could tank doesn&#x27;t bother them; few investors in the market will be willing to go on a very long term bet against this stock, per the hypothesis, so the stock will do just fine in the near/medium term as a self-fulfilling prophecy; eventually those decisions may catch up and tank the stock, at which point most will jump ship with comfortable profit.<p>It&#x27;s well known that having a long term interest yields much better results on the stock market (viz Buffet, other large investors that control companies). Not every investor has this luxury.<p>So I agree that it may be a good idea to change corporate structure if<p>1) the hypothesis is good<p>2) we want to see companies succeed more on long time frames (one might not necessarily want this, maybe with Darwinist ideals, or favoring rapid technological/structural change)<p>In fact I&#x27;ve seen some companies recently do just that: deliberately neglect shareholder micromanagement in favor of the long term.

I find it hard to figure out what his actual argument is (beyond cheap innuendo about ideologies), but he seems to not assume that, e.g., <i>&quot;Yunus believed that the poor, and especially women, could establish an informal microenterprise and then sell basic goods and services to other poor people in the community.&quot;</i><p>If I understand his argument correctly (including the way he mis-invokes Say&#x27;s law), he seems to be saying that lending to people to start new enterprises is not a worthwhile activity because the new small enterprises compete with existing small enterprises, in this competition some enterprises go bankrupt (because he says demand for the produced goods is fixed, what?!), thus new enterprises enabled by this lending just displace other enterprises, producing no net benefit to society.<p>But isn&#x27;t that just straight wrong? His argument doesn&#x27;t even seem specific to micro-lending, it reads like an argument against lending and/or entrepreneurship in general.<p>He also invokes &quot;profitability&quot; as a bad thing, which is weird since why else would anyone commit capital to this. On the other hand, non-profitability and charity, he says, is also bad — <i>No need for solidarity movements and active resistance to exploitation and unfair conditions imposed on developing countries — just send a donation to Kiva and the poor can take care of themselves!</i><p>I know there are questions about how effective microfinance is in practice (cursory search gave me <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w18950"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/papers/w18950</a>), but this just seems like a bad argument.

The whole network of US paper tape gear switching centers was then replaced by one mainframe computer.<p>Today, we think nothing of software that needs a few gigabytes to display a text message.",1448579219

Then again, you can actually make real things with Java; everything from games (Minecraft) to the web (sort of) to apps (most Android apps) to OS programming (Android, itself) is reasonably do-able. So, the empowerment level is high. It just seems like something more immediate would be preferable, at least for the first class (to parallel the use of BASIC in my day; maybe Python would be a good choice, since it can be used for real projects, too).",1448579202

In those 9 years, the Firefox browser share rose to peak of ~30% in 2010 and then fell consistently due to competition from Chrome.[2]<p>In 2014, when Google&#x27;s contract with Mozilla came up for renewal, Firefox browser market share was just 12.4%.[3] Google probably decided that continuing to pay Mozilla the same amount of money for much less traffic wasn&#x27;t worth it, so they didn&#x27;t renew.<p>Mozilla then locked Yahoo! into a five-year contract.[4] One year into the Yahoo deal, Firefox&#x27;s browser market share is now 9.8%.[3] If the long term declining trend continues, four years later the market share would be even smaller. That&#x27;s when Yahoo!&#x27;s contract ends.<p>That&#x27;s also when the question will arise: if Google paid $300 million a year for search traffic from 12.4% browser share in 2014 who will pay how much for far less search traffic in 2019?<p>[1] Nov 25, 2015: Mozilla’s 2014 annual report: Revenue up 4.9% to $329M, 90% came from Google and Yahoo <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/25/mozillas-2014-annual-report-revenue-up-4-9-to-329m-90-came-from-google-and-yahoo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/25/mozillas-2014-annual-repor...</a><p>[2] Wikipedia: Usage share of web browsers > Historical usage share > StatCounter (July 2008 to present) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#StatCounter_.28July_2008_to_present.29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#St...</a><p>[3] Oct 21, 2015: Firefox will fight back against intrusive advertisers <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/firefox-will-fight-back-against-intrusive-advertisers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/firefox-will-fight-back-against-int...</a><p>[4] Nov 19, 2014: Yahoo and Mozilla Form Strategic Partnership\n<a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2014/11/yahoo-and-mozilla-form-strategic-partnership/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2014/11/yahoo-and-mozilla-for...</a>",1448579177

10635122,comment,10631953,10631953,0,0,nickff,,,"There have been many valid criticisms of microcredit, but this article is not one of them, chiefly because it falls victim to a few logical fallacies and faulty assertions.<p>This piece assumes that the poor people using microcredit are doing so to help acquire goods for trade (or another similar), and since their customer base will gain no new wealth, the goods will go unused.  Much of the investments that microcredit loans are used for are things like metal roofs (which are far superior to and less maintenance intensive than thatched roofs),  and simple tools which improve productivity, thus allowing them to engage in trade or other activites which help to improve their lifestyle.  We should remember that just because someone is a poor farmer now does not mean they have to continue being just a farmer with low output; they could get a second job, improve their farm&#x27;s output, or go out to sell their goods to another village if they had the time and resources; we should not dedicate all aid resources to keeping subsistence farmers tethered to the same farms with the same tools, but slightly improving their plight.<p>The article also seems to assume that the bad motives (mainly greed) of some microcredit lenders will lead to bad results, and that lending money to poor people is somehow immoral (possibly due to something like the Copenhagen interpretation of ethics), and that this immorality makes the loan bad.<p>One fact I found very notable and surprising, though not mentioned in this article, is that a great deal of microcredit is actually used as a savings commitment device (as many people have negative effective interest rates for various reasons), so it allows the borrower to make larger capital expenditures than they would otherwise have been able to, because they had issues preventing them from saving up.",1448578937

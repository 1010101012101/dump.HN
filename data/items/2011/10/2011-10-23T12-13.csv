3146010,comment,3145330,3145330,3,0,dyske,,,"I read several comments made about those who lost their jobs can now re-train themselves and apply their productivity elsewhere. But would there really be such opportunities in today's hyper-efficient economy? Think about iPhone apps. Only a small percentage of developers at the top make money. In a sense, the rest of the developers are out of work. Now, if they were to apply their productivity elsewhere, they would need to find a different market. So, they might try the Android market but there too, there are only small percentage of people making any money. Do you think there would be enough markets in the world for everyone to be in the top percentile that makes money?<p>Furthermore, the efficiency is an effect of the entire market. It is the market collectively that identifies the best products/ideas and rewords them disproportionately. We humans have limits in how quickly we can become efficient. At the rate the world is becoming efficient, we humans cannot humanly catch up with that speed. It is dehumanizing to expect people to do so. So, I don't think it is fair to blame those who failed to adapt quickly enough.",1319374584

That's one of the main reasons we don't see any innovation in the banking space where things are desperately underdeveloped.<p>A benevolent banking startup could do a lot of things to really help consumers, and they could do them EASILY with what we have in place now. They could implement reasonable and sustainable fee structures and they could set account transactions up such that fees are avoided instead of maximized. Big banking wants to keep things right where they are, of course; if they could possibly get a fee out of you based on your account's activity, they are going to do everything possible to make sure that things execute in such a way that that activity occurs: arbitrary holds and delays on checks, manipulation of transaction post orders, intentionally confusing account summaries (""account balance"" and ""available balance"", and sometimes worse), nickel-and-dimed on fees for normal usage (""0.50 analysis fee"", ""5.00 new card fee"", ""5.00 maintenance fee"", and soon, ""5.00 debit card fee""), and many, many other things all collude to create a horrible experience for the end user.<p>""Front banks"" like WePay, Braintree, or others, can't really do much about these processes and have to forward the BS received from the big banks on to their customers.

410009,comment,409659,409978,0,0,tdavis,,,"<i>""Because [language feature in A] doesn't look like [language feature in B].""</i><p>Well, obviously. It's not like I'm arguing that Ruby's syntax is for The Gays because it differs from Python's. I find nothing fundamentally <i>wrong</i> with it, other than the fact that it is not intuitive to me, having seen hundreds of incantations of the <i>for</i> loop. An oft-touted ""feature"" of Ruby is that it is intuitive; I find it to not be intuitive. This is entirely my opinion.<p>In the end, a large portion of one's opinion of a language is based off of personal preference. There are undeniable, factual problems with Ruby in terms of performance, community maturity, complexity, language features, etc. There are even more opinion-based, subjective reasons why <i>I feel it is a poor language choice</i>. I make no attempts to justify these reasons beyond making it clear that they are merely my opinions. And I was quite clear on that.<p>If you can come up with as many silly reasons (some of my reasons aren't silly by any definition, but I digress) to hate Python, then go right ahead. I certainly don't care. I wasn't ranting about it to try to convince anybody of anything; why I like a language isn't important enough to make a soap box out of it. I was asked a question, I answered that question. That's all.",1230273132

This preview release is intended to demonstrate core functionalities and help work out major issues. Over the next couple of weeks I'll be focusing on documentation, screen casts, and stabilization.<p>There are some interesting and novel techniques being used in Recess that you won't see in other popular PHP frameworks. It's a framework I believe will cater well to hackers and the HN crowd.",1230272001

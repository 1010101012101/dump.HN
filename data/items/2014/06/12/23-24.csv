7886709,comment,7886014,7886645,3,0,sillysaurus3,,,"<i>people offered to sell bitcoins at a certain price, and other people decided to accept that offer. One side decided that they prefer x USD to y bitcoins, and the other side decided that they prefer y bitcoins to x USD. So they agreed to swap.</i><p>This is tautology, though.  It&#x27;s just the definition of a market.<p>The couple hundred I refer to are those who (a) have thousands of bitcoins, and (b) enter and exit the market with some frequency.  Those are the people who determine the current price of bitcoin.  I say there are only a few hundred of them because bitcoins have been distributed according to a power curve (as is all wealth), and those few hundred are the ones who have the temperament to wager large sums of money on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis.<p>When one of them decides to exit the market, the price drops noticeably.  When one of them decides to jump back in, the price jumps noticeably, causing others to follow their lead and buy in, which drives up the price even more.<p>If you have currency equivalent to thousands of bitcoins, you can place a large buy order, which triggers a price spike, which causes some upwards &quot;momentum&quot; because a bunch of other people will feel pressured to enter the market due to your large buy order, which of course makes the price rise even more; hence, momentum.  Gamblers with thousands of bitcoins can take advantage of this phenomenon to grow their holdings: place a large buy order, wait for others to follow your lead, then sell.  It&#x27;s obviously not guaranteed to work, but nonetheless that seems to be what these gamblers are doing.<p>Announcements serve to trigger a bunch of these &quot;gambler whales&quot; into action all at once, so you get large fluctuations in price.  But there isn&#x27;t a fundamental reason for this price drop beyond the game theory presented above.  The claim that the price movement is based on underlying fundamentals or logic simply doesn&#x27;t match the available evidence.  Evidence thus far indicates that the price fluctuation is due to a combination of market manipulation and gamblers with thousands of bitcoins actively trying to hoodwink their fellow gamblers.",1402617094

7886695,comment,7882597,7882705,1,0,mtdewcmu,,,"Some good questions.<p>>>Isn&#x27;t this the equivalent of giving somebody private URL, like in the article? It&#x27;s essentially the same, functionally, as a password you remember. Except passwords are less secure, as people use the same ones repeatedly, or generate them from a simple system repeatedly (less vulnerable to automated password guessing attempts, but as vulnerable to a dedicated human attacker).<p>Sort of, but not exactly. Login forms, when correctly submitted, usually set a session cookie in the browser. Cookies are sent back to the server with later requests, so you could think of the cookie as if it was part of the URL. Every time you log in, though, you get a cookie with different data inside. That&#x27;s different from a private URL, because the private URL would always remain the same once it has been assigned.<p>If the private URLs are generated by a secure random number generator, then they could potentially be more secure than passwords are. Being secure and hard to guess also makes them long and difficult to remember; and that&#x27;s why passwords are used far more often than random private links. Passwords are meant to be possible for a person to remember and type. Also, passwords are possible to change, so if your password is compromised, you can keep your account and just change the password.<p>>>Are their web frameworks that let you determine if a user is genuine by their behaviour as much as their passwords? E.g. if I usually log in from the US, why am I suddenly logging in from Russia, less than a half-hour since I logged in via the US?<p>I&#x27;m not sure if there are frameworks for that, but I know that some companies have implemented similar kinds of things. Bank of America&#x27;s website that allows you to access your account data adds a few extra features that add security to the standard username/password combo.",1402616854

In fact other systems actually encourage cooperation and favor candidates that are more in the center.<p>And I think that points to a flaw in the conclusion of the article:  attempting to directly change human nature (or culture, as the OP suggests) is a fool&#x27;s errand.<p>Instead, changing the rules of a system, such that the Pareto optimal result and the Nash Equilibrium align more closely, is a much more realistic approach.

These arsenals are relatively cheap for superpowers to build, but they are expensive for small states (small countries/small businesses) to acquire.<p>The US and USSR were roughly equivalent in their arsenals so it made little sense for either party to act offensively.  However, the implied power behind the arsenals gave them a lot of power when dealing with smaller actors. The superpowers benefit greatly from acquiring these arsenals.  Even without using them publicly, the threat can always be used behind closed doors (as Jobs has been shown to do).<p>But there&#x27;s a third actor; the most universally feared actor: terrorists/patent trolls.

It&#x27;s bad of course.</i><p>This is exactly what I meant by &quot;you&#x27;ll fool yourself into believing things that aren&#x27;t true.&quot; You cannot reason about the price of bitcoin in terms of fundamentals. Not right now; not when the price is a function of a few hundred people (some of whom are maliciously manipulating the market).<p>I&#x27;ve been closely watching how the price of bitcoin reacts to announcements since mid last year. The price goes up? People come up with a reason that makes sense. The price goes down? People come up with a reason. The price has gone down; you&#x27;ve come up with a reason, and lo, it seems to make sense. Except none of these reasonings make any sense whatsoever because <i>the market isn&#x27;t logical</i>. It doesn&#x27;t pay any attention to your theories, or mine, or anyone else&#x27;s. The price inexorably follows from the actions of fewer than a couple hundred people, almost all of whom are trying to prey off each other. That&#x27;s the game. Buy to raise the price; sell after others follow your lead.<p>You can craft a theory that makes sense for any possible upswing or downswing. But what fools we were to think our theories mattered back in November, when the price was almost entirely due to Mt. Gox&#x27;s market manipulation!<p>My opinion in this matter has been forged by the heavy hammer of experience. Don&#x27;t make my mistake; don&#x27;t delude yourself by having the hubris to think you alone can reason your way around an irrational gambler&#x27;s market. Here&#x27;s how it will go. You&#x27;ll make some money, and you&#x27;ll feel smart and elated. Then you&#x27;ll risk a little bit too much on your &quot;insight&quot; and watch as it crumbles beneath your feet and you lose some money. But not too much; you&#x27;re smart, after all. But then you&#x27;ll hear stories of others who have fared Bette than you, and you&#x27;ll start to get a bit jealous. <i>It&#x27;s just a matter of experience,</i> you&#x27;ll tell yourself. <i>I&#x27;ll do better now that I know not to do that again.</i> So you&#x27;ll try a new, more insightful theory. A theory based on sound fundamentals. And then you&#x27;ll make a bunch of money, and you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;ve got it all figured out. So you&#x27;ll wager even more on your theory (which, somehow, everyone else has seemingly overlooked, but Nevermind that, our theory is based on logic so it must be correct!) and then when the market&#x27;s irrationality catches up to your reality, you&#x27;ll lose big.<p>Greed does indeed drive the market. And greed doesn&#x27;t play by fair or logical rules.",1402614527
7886552,comment,7886014,7886480,6,0,Ologn,,,"> people still think it&#x27;s a scam when huge companies with massive legal departments are accepting it.<p>Sub-prime real estate was a scam. Huge companies with massive legal departments protected themselves from the illegal part of the scam - all those loan officers telling people to lie on their loan applications.  In fact these banks got their lobbyists to get them TARP bailouts after the scam had run its course.<p>Banks are willing to trade subprime &quot;liar loans&quot; once legally insulated, so big companies willing to deal with Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t really mean much.<p>I didn&#x27;t say it was impossible to short Bitcoins.  They are not FX traded alongside the dollar, euro, yen etc. though.<p>The central question is, why do Bitcoins have value?  Why did subprime real estate loans, pets.com stock and Dutch tulip blubs have value?  Actually, both these things were hypothetically more valuable than Bitcoins.  Bitcoins are worthless.<p>When the price of a Bitcoin drops below $100, are people here going to learn a lesson about how value works?  I don&#x27;t think they will.  That&#x27;s the thing - Bitcoin will crash, and those talking it up here won&#x27;t have learned a thing.  If they did, these scams (subprime, pets.com stock, dutch Tulip Bulbs) couldn&#x27;t keep popping up over time suckering people in.  People have no concept of the relation of price to value, and thus are easily fooled.",1402614505

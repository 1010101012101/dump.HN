Tomahawk and Musiq come close but they each leave something to be desired. iTunes circa 2008 was pretty good, but I&#x27;d like something for Linux, and I&#x27;d like it built in Java too, because I&#x27;ve found over the years that Java has amazing compatibility with sound cards on almost every computer.<p>I really like Google Music, but I don&#x27;t like managing my music via the cloud. And I&#x27;ve tried just about every Linux home audio server and they all are a little wonky.<p>Some very basic features I see missing or hard to access in music players are:<p>- no ability to shuffle on different levels of granularity: genere/artist/year/etc<p>- ID3 tag editing somehow is terrible in everything but iTunes<p>- Full equalizer and audio effects (e.g., reverb, compression, filters)<p>- Canonical and clean song/album/artist data with extra attributes listed as comments, not cluttering up the main tags--I don&#x27;t care that your song is &quot;Feat. Jay-z;T-Pain;Snoop Lion;Sting; (album version (explicit version))&quot;<p>And stepping back, I think the whole grid/table-based approach to viewing your music is a bit lifeless. I&#x27;d like to see other ways to navigate, .e.g., something built on the data that Pandora or Last FM has, but specific to my collection. And I&#x27;d also like to be able to navigate by artist history and associations, e.g., see all my albums by bands that have ever opened for the Flaming Lips.",1406534055

8095612,comment,8094186,8094186,21,0,gumby,,,"> Line editing...a backspace key is often useful. This could of course be implemented by the applications themselves, but in accordance with the UNIX design philosophy, applications should be kept as simple as possible. So as a convenience, the operating system provides an editing buffer<p>Actually this is backwards.<p>Line discipline is a historical artifact.  Typically mainframes had IO front ends (AKA channel controllers) than managed IO so that the CPU (which BTW was what was charged for) could be kept busy and not wait around for users (by contrast CTSS, ITS and later machines like the Alto expressed an alternative, radical idea which was that the computer was there to support the user).  Basically once a line was ready it was submitted by pressing the enter key and then its process was unblocked and processed the data.  (Nowadays we just queue an event on the main thread...essentially the same thing!).<p>Likewise, a number of early network protocols like X.25 would charge per &quot;line&quot; (more about that later).<p>Unix was originally written for the PDP-7 (& later 11) which were minicomputers that didn&#x27;t have channel controllers (in fact the earliest arpanet interfaces that weren&#x27;t IMPS were PDP-11s acting as networking channel controllers for PDP-10 mainframes).  Since IO was done by the kernel, you didn&#x27;t want to to an expensive context switch for the common case of just reading a character and putting it into an input buffer.<p>So despite the comment quoted above, the true Unix model would have been for the kernel to have been agnostic and for each program to decide how it wanted to handle character input.  But that would have been too expensive, so a more pragmatic approach prevailed.<p>By the way there are all sorts of other fossils in the TTY system.  Multics used # to delete a character and @ to rub out the whole line -- a legacy of printing characters that persisted into Unix for years ###### decades.  This seems weird today, but originally Multics (and later Unix) didn&#x27;t have traditional line disciplines, or even control characters, much less select().  So it was handy to be able to essentially do immediate mode editing right in the input buffer.<p>Another fossil is that vi is just a visual mode grafted onto ed (clone of Multics qed IIRC), which was an editor with commands based on line-at-a-time IO.<p>ITS got proper IO virtualization first (and the predecessor to select, and extended it to the network with SUPDUP, later also implemented by Multics and eventually Unix, which made using Emacs possible) and actually had a more general version of select() before Unix was written, but at the time it was considered exotic.<p>Oh and the X.25 comment?  Well in 1982 I was working in France and the only way for me and my colleagues who had come from MIT to get back to our mail at the MIT AI lab was a connect across the ocean on an international X.25 network hooked into MIT Multics and thence connect to the AI lab.  After using fully interactive systems, it was painful to use a line-at-a-time system, so I figured out how to reset the X.25 front end to ship a whole packet for every character typed (packets had a maximum length so if you typed a really long line it would send a packet&#x27;s worth, so I hacked it into thinking that a packet length was 1).  Which was great, until shortly after the end of the month when someone &quot;upstairs&quot; had a heart attack at the size of the networking bill...",1406533587

It is not possible to split a proton into its constituent quarks because quarks can never exist on their own. As far as we know they only appear in pairs or three at a time as in the proton.<p>There is also the issue of baryon number conservation. This is physical law (as far as we know) that says that the number of baryons must be constant. A proton is a baryon and neuron is a baryon but there are lots more. Anti-particles count negative so we can destroy a proton by combining it with an anti-proton, if we would happen to have one.

8095563,comment,8094559,8094568,0,0,e12e,,,"Ok, so if I understand this correctly, in order to be certain I&#x27;m not tracked, I need to host my own back-end server? And the server stores the comments? And if I&#x27;m hosting my own server, I&#x27;m likely to end up talking mostly with those that sign up with &quot;my&quot; version of this? And if I want it to work in eg: Firefox I&#x27;d have to port it? Finally, wrt. tracking -- if the comments are stored on the server (and that&#x27;s a REST service or something like it) -- wouldn&#x27;t it be trivial to log activity at the routing level (eg: ha-proxy/nginx/other front-facing web server)?<p>This isn&#x27;t meant as negative criticism, just trying to figure out if I&#x27;ve understood how it works correctly? (Note, I appreciate that the source is available, but obviously I can&#x27;t know that the source you share is the source you run on your back-end. So we&#x27;re back to trust, which is fine in my book).<p>[edit: re other clients -- the most straightforward thing to do would be to make an iframe(or js)-based proxy service (a la stumble upon) in order to enable any browser, I suppose?<p>I&#x27;ve thought about something similar, and I wonder if an XMPP back-end with one &quot;room&quot; pr url and the server-side log-extension might work? That should then make it trivial (unnecessary!) to enable better clients than web-only -- ie use a command line xmpp client to participate in the discussion, rather than forcing the use of the web browser. I realise many people think using the web browser is an advantage -- I generally find GUIs built on top of browsers to be slow and not very efficient. Extensions less so -- but the problem is of course that you&#x27;d have to port to Firefox, Opera, Webkit and IE (along with mobile variants) -- to achieve parity with systems like disqus etc]",1406532264

However, it seems like it would be hard to apply these statistics to refute someone who is saying both that &quot;the A&#x27;s are different&quot; and &quot;championship games are different&quot;.<p>For instance, if Michael Jordan wins 100 one-on-one games of basketball against me, I could come out an say &quot;Yes, but if we played on the International Space Station, then I&#x27;d win. ISS games are different.&quot;. To refute that you&#x27;d need a body of evidence of basketball games on ISS. Let&#x27;s say you have 5000 games of history on the ISS, where the players&#x27; success rates are almost identical to those on Earth&#x27;s surface. I could still say &quot;But <i>I&#x27;m</i> different. Everyone else tries to play ISS basketball like Earth basketball, but I have these cool tricks.&quot;. Controlling for both of those things seems to require having lots of data about <i>me</i> playing on the ISS.<p>None of that means the post to which you responded is right. But if the claims &quot;the A&#x27;s are different&quot; and &quot;the championships are different&quot; both seem plausible; and if the A&#x27;s record in championships is poor compared with the regular season; then you should dial back the confidence a bit.",1406532070

You want to be able to do things like A[1, 2:6] to get elements two through six of the first row of A.

I am not trying to argue what the &quot;true meanings&quot; of words are, because that&#x27;s useless (although it&#x27;s clearly a very attractive style of argument to many people in this thread). I have told you what definitions I am using, and clearly, anarchism is not politics according to my definitions. I would prefer you address the actual ideas I have expressed, rather than argue over &quot;true meanings&quot; of words. Also, I am not saying that all <i>discussion of political philosophy</i> is bad, because that field inevitably concerns itself with beliefs which advocate refraining from political activity.<p>> so it&#x27;s not unreasonable to view absolute anarchy as 7 billion different totalitarian nations.<p>It is unreasonable if you want to have intelligent discussions using concise terms. That&#x27;s why, if the members of a discussion are unable or unwilling to agree upon a few basic definitions, the only arguments available are semantic arguments. Thus, discussions involving the concept of &quot;nations&quot; or &quot;states&quot; should be based on an agreement of terms, and the only conceivable useful definitions for those terms would exclude individual humans.",1377039447

Similarly, if you dislike the service of your private protection agency (which is still a government, just not monopolistic), then if you stop paying you&#x27;ll just end up dead, unless you can pay for equivalent protection from someone else.  This is how mafia protection works, for example.  Currently, we don&#x27;t kill people for running out of money, and debtor&#x27;s prisons are illegal.<p>Furthermore, in such a system if you have more money than the guy next to you, you can pay to have more rights than the guy next to you.  A philosophy of a la carte rights to the highest bidder is absolutely materialistic and denies the fundamental equality of all humans.  Why revert to being animals?  Why do you believe that some humans are more valuable than other humans?<p>Yes, abuse of government authority is unpleasant, but if like me you find it distasteful that the US can abuse its economic power to trample people in other nations around the world, how do you tolerate the idea of billionaires doing whatever the hell they please, including bribing all the &quot;private protection agencies&quot; of the people that get in their way?

Even in the animal world, territorial rights are enforced by animals themselves or groups of animals.

Indeed, it&#x27;s much better than having to protect your own property yourself all the time, but it&#x27;s much worse than hiring private protection agencies. Two reasons: 1) you can&#x27;t stop paying for the government service if you dislike it 2) customers who may need various levels of protection cannot subscribe to various service plans, thus some customers get inadequate levels or protection, while some subsidize protection of others.<p>Again, enforcing property rights != government.

I don&#x27;t know what rkhunter would do to stop an intrusion, and fail2ban stopping a brute-force on your SSH login is hardly the likely intrusion vector for a server running this many services.<p>These tools still require a huge amount of systems administration work before it really counts as a &quot;personal cloud&quot;. rkhunter looks for some basic rootkits but will not really protect you from emerging threats, other than to tell you you have a file integrity mismatch on a common file such as /usr/bin/login.<p>Since this is installing everything, it seems wise to add better host-based intrusion detection/file integrity checking across all services and configurations, via AIDE[1] or Samhain[2], which you could do with this type of automated setup.

I have often used progress bars that have no connection whatsoever with the process they&#x27;re &quot;measuring&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the technique I&#x27;ve found works well:<p>1. Estimate the time the operation will usually take. Call that W (it can be a constant, or you can use a heuristic to guess it specifically for the user).<p>2. Pick a function that asymptotically approaches 1, e.g. the error function. Transform it it so that f(0.75*W) = 0.75.<p>3. Now for elapsed time t, fill your progress bar to f(t).<p>The upshot is that the bar will start fast, and never completely fill. And for the first 75% of the estimated time, it will be accurate (as long as your estimate is). After that, it matters less, since it will take a while for the user&#x27;s brain to adjust to the slower speed.",1377037055

(Be warned though, this code is untested!)</i>&quot;<p>First off, I wouldn&#x27;t call that &quot;Easy&quot; code, or an &quot;Easy&quot; solution if that it is untested? More like a hypotheses. Secondly, I don&#x27;t think that is a good alternative solution at all. That seems like a very messy way to handle the indication by changing the size of the scrollbar based on user triggered events.<p>While there are some decent points in this article (such as not splitting up your content into pages for ads), I think it still doesn&#x27;t do a good job of defending why the top vertical bar for progress indication is bad. Nor does it give a good alternative.<p>And, as <i>clone1018</i> pointed out in another comment, I don&#x27;t think the indication feature was meant to be this ground-breaking UX feature or anything. I think it&#x27;s more of some eye-candy for his blog.<p>I would be much more interested in a counter argument article on using the top horizontal bar for loading purposes (like YouTube does), since that is becoming more of a common UX feature.",1377036195

The big breakthrough that Einstein made in general relativity was  the 'relative' bit.  There is no absolute thing of 'time', no universal tick of a clock.  There is the time as experience by the traveller and the time as experienced by the brother.  So there is no discontinuity that has to be merged when they meet.<p>It seems to me your question makes an implicit assumption that there is a universal tick that is thrown out of whack when the brothers meet.  But there isn't, so the question is invalid.<p>I wonder if perhaps you regard space as one thing and time as a separate thing.  It might help to throw that out and regard it as a four-dimensional object called spacetime.<p>For the merry-go-round, I'm not sure why you say one voice sounds low and the other high.  They won't.  Einstein's big thought experiment was to realise that the speed of light is constant no matter the speed of the observer.<p>As an aside, it is an unfortunate historical artifact that we call c the speed of light.

They don't like the rules. Quora definitely challenges the rules of how we interact online, and who is an expert, and that scares people.<p>3. They think it's just another ""Q&A website"" and why would we need another one like that?<p>4. They don't trust mechanisms around voting and the use of anonymity to troll?<p>5. They don't like that its founders were able to raise Series A money at such an attractive valuation.<p>6. They don't like the sites plan to boost signal over noise as the user base grows, which includes vigilance among community members and ranking users.<p>I am a heavy Quora user and biased toward the site. I understand why some of these items above irk people, but I also believe that most of them, upon investigation, turn out to be mostly unfounded. Briefly -> TechCrunch and other tech outlets are in the business of writing about new technologies and trends, even if vocal parts of their audience hates it. The rules around Quora scares many people who already have carved out little pieces of land online, especially ""experts."" One of the biggest fallacies around Quora is that it's a ""Q&A site"" -- that is just the tip of the iceberg. I'll admit that there are ways to lurk anonymously on Twitter, but I'm pretty sure that people behind the scenes monitor for unsavory behavior and vandalism, and that those in charge would and will ban users for foul play. The Series A valuation now seems like a bargain, but what many don't realize is that the technology built under the hood at Quora is itself unique and very valuable, as well as the team and SEO juice. Finally, their most complex UX problem -- keeping signal high using humans and algorithms -- is a challenge that not many teams can tackle.",1300683718

The volume for something that sells well isn't the issue.

Never mind you're receiving a lot of, you know, <i>information</i> or anything.  People want something they can point to and be like ""Yo, I bought that.""  That's hard to do with eBooks, so you have to consistently price them lower.<p>Also, marketing to programmers/the HN crowd is significantly harder than a mainstream crowd because you have to deal with the Nick Burns Effect: you are an idiot and I could totally do everything better than you in a weekend.

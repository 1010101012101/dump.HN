The ~2000 bubble wasn't a bubble because it was wrong, the Internet <i>has</i> revolutionized pretty much everything that we thought it was going to, and continues to do so. It just didn't do it at quite the promised pace, and wasn't able to sustain that much investment, that quickly, nor did it necessarily take the shape that everybody at the time was convinced it would.<p>So when I say we seem to be in an advertising bubble, it's not a statement that there isn't a revolution in advertising coming that somebody is going to profit from, it's a statement that it isn't coming at the pace people like Facebook are promising, nor can it sustain that level of investment profitably. I did make sure to call out Google for having legitimately advanced the field. If the bubble pops they'll get hit, but I have every confidence they'll survive and thrive, because they definitely have real value, just as Amazon has survived and thrived after the last bubble.<p>(I expect somewhere in the 5-15 years time frame there's going to be a robotics bubble too, and it won't be because robots that can coexist with us in our houses and streets won't be every bit as revolutionary as the hype claims, it just won't be revolutionary <i>as quickly</i> as the investment would require.)",1337691331

I'm also a frequent climber (mostly outdoors). If I could not climb, I would not be sedentary - I'd do something(s) else (I already do other activities, too). If I couldn't do anything other than take a stroll every day, I would do that, because I feel better when I move around. Most of the climbers I know are clearly this way - people who can't stand not to be active.<p>I am pretty convinced, myself, that I'd be better off walking for an hour on safe sidewalks every day instead of rock climbing. I think rock climbing, and other activities in which I partake, put me at higher risk for serious injury or death than a nice healthy walk. How much higher, I'm not sure.<p>But it's a free society (I live in the USA) and we can do what we want, so I climb, because I'm kind of addicted.<p>Given the direction that health insurance is taking, I do wonder if people who admit to participating in higher-risk sports will some day be penalized by higher premiums, as smokers are.",1337691250

On the TV they frequently interrupt your program but you'll endure it as the content is longer than the ad. Same with Radio. In Magazines and Papers they constantly jiggle around all the content so you have to at least scan the page to see if it's an advert or an article which means they have at least a chance to grab your attention.<p>Web ads cannot grab your attention because the content they surround is bite-sized so any attempt to interrupt is so much more jarring. They tried a few different ways and generally they failed. The worst new one is the put an ad in the middle of the text, but that too is incredibly jarring and confusing. Another example is the attempt to monetize funny videos by putting a 15 sec ad clip in front of it. But quite often this is as long as the content! Do people even try and endure the ad? I'd love to see the numbers. If I click play on a random video and an ad starts I usually skip to the next article rather than watch the ad.<p>Also when you get into something like Facebook the adverts sit in the same place every time. Which you learn to skip automatically very quickly as you're usually not interested in them. You never have to play hunt the article apart from the very occasional site that has the full page popups which generally means you will start avoiding that site.<p>But worse for advertisers, if they make them too intrusive people <i>can just turn them off</i>. Brilliant!<p>The only ad I've recently seen that made me think, hmm, this could work are the occasional full page background adverts they run on IMDB.<p>Also Facebook didn't used to have ads, they just added them to the side of the page at one point. And I doubt the future of ads does look like the Deck Network, it's just another advertising network. They seem to be teaching some strange ideas at your college, I'd be interested to see the data that backs it up.",1337691072

This meant that people quite often had problems where the solution was ""run it in the actual python interpreter"". When I first started writing bpython one of the design goals was that all code that runs in bpython would also run the same in the vanilla REPL. This is why there is no extended syntax such as that provided by IPython (I don't actually use it so can't give good examples, but I think you can do things like ""object?"" to get help etc.). IPython also had some issues with unicode and encodings that may have since been resolved.<p>This is the only good reason I would recommend bpython over IPython objectively. Other than that, it's just a matter of taste - bpython is just a standard shell with some nice features to aid the user whereas IPython has a whole host of features and extensions and integrations that make it a great tool for lots of people. I don't think you have to use one or the other and I don't see them as competing pieces of software. IPython is a great tool and seems to suit a lot of people, particularly those in the mathematic and scientific communities.<p>Let me put it this way: if IPython implemented all of the features that bpython has and bpython became entirely redundant then I would only be happy that people have a great tool to help them with their development and that bpython may have played a part in helping it get to that state.",1337690761

It's a networking effect, a real-time version of good old word-of-mouth advertising, which has always been by far the best kind to have.<p>Weaker personal actions such as likes, follows, mailing list subscriptions and all that jazz might have some benefit, but I don't believe it's anything like as much. I'm thinking this is because these are personal expressions of interest, but in reality they probably have little if any networking power.<p>I lack faith that any sort of paid Facebook advertising will even have a positive RoI, based on a few small-scale experiments that I personally know about and on media reporting of larger organisations not doing any better. I suspect a lot of people treat these ads much as they would treat junk mail: just another form of spam to be auto-ignored, and probably subject to banner blindness by now.",1337690575

And nothing has shaken it, not even when this process is helped by the distribution network, like making Bing the default on Windows.<p>Lock-in is not measured only in regards to the potential switching costs. Lock-in is also possible by providing the best possible service. Along with real network effects (people recommending your service to other people) then the global lock-in becomes inescapable, even if the theoretical switching costs are low.<p>And quite the contrary, GitHub locks people in simply because most developers have a GitHub account. People use GitHub these days to put their portfolio on display. And I've worked with a couple of companies that manage their projects on GitHub and it was a pretty painless process to send me an invitation for joining their private repos.<p>Even Linux is mirrored on GitHub and even Linus Tolvards has a GitHub account. GitHub is not only a really good Git hosting service, but in case you haven't noticed, it's also a vertical social-network built for developers. And their service keeps improving by leaps and bounds, compared to their competitors, which are merely followers. I'm so happy with GitHub that even though I can have as many private projects as I want on Bitbucket, I still pay GitHub for the privilege to have private projects.<p>Yes, something better can always come along. But just as Google did for search engines, with GitHub around it's pretty hard to build something better. And this to me is the best possible kind of lock-in and the sign of a thriving and growing company: the product being popular, not because it's forcing users, but because it's simply the best.",1337688937

4007412,comment,4007047,4007337,24,0,unalone,,,"Advertising student. Advertising's not in a bubble; some very rich and formerly successful advertisers are just doing an awful job at adjusting to the change in society that's now been twenty years in the making. Dumbasses.<p>Here's how advertising works from its creator's point of view. There are a few principles abstract enough that you can apply to any piece of advertising. Good advertising positions itself within a market, develops a brand image, establishes its product as a good product (not even necessarily better-than: as long as you look trustworthy and people know your name, you'll sell). The bulk of ad research, meanwhile, goes into studying individual forms. TV ads. Product placement in films. Radio spots. Magazine spots. There's a series of long-tested techniques which advertisers rely on. Even these techniques usually fail, because plenty of advertisers are fucking idiots who don't get that ads are a creative medium, and if you're formulaic rather than creative, you'll sell jack shit.<p>The challenge of the Internet is that every web site has its own unique form. Most of these forms weren't even <i>designed</i> for ads (Facebook at least knew how they wanted to sell ads; Twitter still has no clue). To sell on Twitter is different from selling on Facebook is different from selling on Reddit or Tumblr or Pinterest or Instagram. There's no formula. And some of these sites are so limited that advertisers simply have no clue how to push their shitty little message out to suckers, ahem, consumers.<p>The fix, of course, is that instead of selling a brand you start interesting conversations, create dialogues that engage people with the thing you're selling, even start communities of people who revolve around your product. But advertisers aren't bright enough or genuine enough or ambitious enough to do this the right way. Community-building especially: nobody wants to join a forum for a product that isn't a car. Yet some people persist in thinking that if they build it, fans will come.<p>One future of advertising looks like the Deck Network, where people so trust the advertisers that they'll click on the ads willingly. One's the model Facebook is still struggling with: connect super-small businesses with precisely the people who want to buy their product. These anti-Facebook ads stories recently only show that you have to be smarter advertising on Facebook than you'd have to be in a newspaper. The really good Facebook ads get friends talking about them, because they really are something that those people enjoy. But that runs counter to how advertisers think about their sheep, goddammit I mean targets, no wait that doesn't sound nice either.<p>The real bubble is: stop treating people like products, start treating them like people. That means fewer start-ups designed to sucker people into wanting some bullshit connection they never really needed (YC has some exactly like this), fewer advertisers looking down at the masses like they're ripe for the picking, fewer businesses geared toward herding people up and selling them wholesale. The more freedom you give people w/r/t how they consume media and how they express themselves, the harder it is to trap them in your crap. Ultimately it becomes more profitable to just treat them like human beings, and act like a human yourself. But plenty of products will die when this happens because plenty of products were never intended for human consumption in the first place.",1337688675

4007407,comment,4007047,4007337,7,0,jonnathanson,,,"There definitely is -- and it may still be too early to say ""was"" -- a period of social media advertising frenzy among Fortune 500 companies in the last few years. Until fairly recently (with GM's $30M pullout of Facebook advertising the most visible harbinger). Now the honeymoon is just about over, and with it will go the easy money that had basically been throwing itself at Facebook's heels. Facebook in specific, and social advertising in general, will have to find a way to deliver <i>actual</i> results in line with people's sky-high expectations. And they'll have to do it soon. This won't be easy, given that Facebook's ad sales teams have spent the last 3+ years promising the moon to F500 marketing and advertising execs.<p>But why were all these advertisers so willing to be wooed in the first place?<p>Because there's a very real (and growing) hole in the advertising landscape. With the erosion of TV advertising as a reliable way to generate mass impressions at scale, advertisers are anxious to find a replacement. TV is still the largest advertising vechicle, by media spend, for most F500 companies (if not all of them?). But premiums on TV are growing each year, even while total ratings are declining, audiences are dispersing (both across networks and onto other platforms), and ads are basically avoidable. While the bloom was on the Facebook rose, it seemed like a hell of a savior to people desperately seeking one.<p>The fallacy underpinning the leap from TV onto the Facebook bandwagon was the assumption that social media could be bought, and advertised on, in pretty much the same way as TV. In reality, the advertiser needs to be much more savvy and sophisticated about social advertising. He needs to worry about more than just reach, frequency, and CPMs. He'll need to consider the quality of his content, refresh rates for content, geo-targeting and context-targeting, the relevancy algorithms powering his anticipated reach and engagement figures, and the micro-segments to which he serves different ads at different times. Instead, right now he's spent the last few years simply throwing giant checks at Facebook and expecting TV reach, impressions, etc.<p>I'd consider both parties at fault here: the advertisers for being naive, and Facebook for playing to the deep-pocketed suckers. Picking the low-hanging fruit, in this case, may have set back Facebook's credibility within the advertising community for quite some time. And it also set expectations that Facebook wasn't, and still isn't, prepared to meet. (In fairness, I'm sure Facebook received a great deal of pressure to take the easy ad money in order to make its books look as attractive as possible in anticipation of the IPO).",1337688592

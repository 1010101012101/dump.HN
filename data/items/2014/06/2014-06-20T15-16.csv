7921261,comment,7920877,7921042,2,0,ganeumann,,,"Not that I think Uber is handling this constructively, but there&#x27;s a valid reason why they would not offer the valuation bandied about in the press: they are not buying the same equity as the $17 billion+ equity.<p>The venture investors bought Preferred equity, the shares being sold by the employee are almost certainly Common equity. Common equity is worth less than Preferred equity. The times I have seen offers to buy Common shares in connection with a Preferred round, the discount has been as high as 50%.<p>This makes sense: assume you are an investor putting $1.2 billion into a company that has previously raised $300 million (this is roughly the recent Uber situation.) You are investing at a $17 billion valuation. Now assume that you were very, very wrong on the valuation and the company ends up selling for 90% less: $1.7 billion. You still get your money back. If the company goes on and sells for $34 billion, you double your money. This asymmetrical payout is one reason venture firms are comfortable taking the risk of such a high valuation.<p>Now assume you bought $10 million of Common shares from a former employee. If the company ended up selling for $1.7 billion, you would get back roughly $100,000 (assuming the preferred owns half the company.) You don&#x27;t really have an asymmetrical payout: you stand to lose money if the valuation is wrong.<p>A wider the spread between the Preferred price and the Common price implies less confidence in the Preferred valuation. The actual valuation is the Common valuation, and the extra amount paid for Preferred stock is a kind of option value. So an alternative explanation to Uber short-changing its Common shareholders is that they believe the expected value of the company is closer to $4 billion than $17 billion and the Preferred buyers think the range of possible outcomes has an extremely large standard deviation.",1403279976

Even if there&#x27;s a slowdown of CPU power, there&#x27;s still quite a lot left over for the sloppy coders of the world.  Especially when we consider a lot of software isn&#x27;t CPU bound, but storage bound, and even the most commodity SSD blows away the spinning disk.  Oh, we&#x27;re also all 64-bit now and computers shipping today come with 8gb of RAM.<p>We recently played the constraint game with the mobile/tablet space. It was fun while it lasted, but now with quad-cores and 1 to 2gb of RAM standard, its over as well.  Tablets have become the new laptops. Phones have become the new tablets. Its boring.<p>I think the days you pine for are forever gone, at least in the general computing space. I find that once something new comes around, its naturally constricted and if it allows people some level of freedom and creativity, then the weirdo early adopters will rush in, and in that group there will always be a handful of super-stars.  This minority makes the big crazy strides or the crazy efficient game and then go into more respectable work.<p>We also saw this with the early web, which was so much more innovative and experimental than the &quot;social marketing&quot; mode we&#x27;ve all agreed works best.  That matured quickly as well. Look how the web browser is pretty much a platform, if not a quasi-OS, in itself. We keep reinventing the big bloaty OS and big bloaty applications for reasons that make sense; because people want big bloaty toys and the bells and whistles they offer.<p>So where&#x27;s the next new constrained system young hackers are going to blow ours minds with? Maybe 3D printing. Maybe drones. Maybe VR. Maybe automated and electric cars. But even those have a certain level of maturity already.  We might not know until it actually happens. Who saw TBL and the www coming? I suspect very few.<p>I personally hope to wake up one day to a new Jobs/Woz combo offering me something straight out of sci-fi, like a home robot with useful arms and enough AI to make use of it or a lucid dreaming machine that actually works or a nootropic that makes us all near geniuses.  Come on guys, stop writing  bejeweled clones and financial apps and blow our minds again. I suspect I still have a few mind blowing events left in my lifetime (almost 40 now).",1403279732

Obviously millions of these requests are going to be for the exact same video, say for example Gangnam Style. So instead of us pulling the data from Youtube every time a user requests that particular video we store that video on our Network, so when a user requests it (even for the first time), it actually comes from us.

The result is a better customer experience (faster streaming) but also far less network traffic (this literally saves millions).<p>Without the storing of IP addresses accessed we wouldn&#x27;t have the information needed to determine what sites/data we should be cashing  and what we don’t need to bother with and this sort of thing would be considerably harder to pull off.",1403279625

Unfortunately when he tries to interface with the rest of the world it can often go horribly wrong.

It&#x27;s their stock to do it with, of course, but it&#x27;s just annoying that seemingly employee-centric companies will do such seemingly abusive things.  For example, I&#x27;ve seen instances of sale restrictions being <i>four</i> contracts deep (e.g., &quot;shall be governed by (x) agreement&quot;, and that agreement says &quot;shall be bound by terms in (y)&quot;, and so on) in an agreement that employees were only ever officially given a draft version of but apparently still held as effective.  It should have never been signed of course, but the obtuse nature and comforting language these things are couched in can be confusing.<p>At the same time, it&#x27;s also unfortunate that people don&#x27;t do research to look at other instruments for liquidity (like pre-paid forward transactions) that the restraining company has zero control over.  In Uber&#x27;s case though, it seems like they&#x27;re actually paying on the up-and-up.  Many companies intentionally deflate the fair market value of shares far, far below the actual valuation (like 1/25th the value paid by investors in the last round, for example), so offering to sell at what the investors paid in at is pretty decent.<p>Private equity is confusing and usually doesn&#x27;t work in your favor.

7921133,comment,7920642,7920642,116,0,Steuard,,,"The biggest issue that I see with publishing this work in a physics journal is that although time travel is certainly a concept in physics, the <i>research</i> involved here is not physics research. I&#x27;d describe it as sociological(?) research intended to shed light on a problem of interest to physics. That may seem like splitting hairs, but there&#x27;s a real question of competence here: as a physicist, I don&#x27;t feel especially qualified to assess the methods they used or the reliability of the conclusions they draw. If they were instead describing an experiment to look for anomalous travel times of neutrino pulses or something, I&#x27;d know where to start: measurement apparatus precision, clock synchronization, etc. But here the observations are based on natural language and the conclusions are based on theories of how information spreads in social networks.<p>Like most physicists, I have <i>zero</i> formal experience in this. It honestly doesn&#x27;t feel like a topic for a physics journal even though a reliable positive result would have profound implications for physics. In the same way, I wouldn&#x27;t expect a technical article reporting measurements of carbon flow in the environment to be published in a political science journal, even though climate change might have profound implications for global politics. [Discussion note: the validity of climate change has nothing to do with my point here.]<p>All that being said, I also don&#x27;t find their negative result to be particular compelling. If their two search terms were &quot;Pope Francis&quot; and &quot;Comet ISON&quot; as described, well, Comet ISON was a dud (and thus won&#x27;t be much of a topic in the future), and it&#x27;s easy to imagine scenarios in which future time travelers would not have a particular interest in Catholic history. And that&#x27;s quite apart from the possibility that time travelers would make some modest effort to avoid asking their neighbors about future events. Maybe that&#x27;s all accounted for in their paper in a compelling way, but I honestly don&#x27;t see any way they could ever argue for more than a very limited negative result. And I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s publishable in any sort of competitive journal.",1403278404

Last was a washing machine this month, from our local GE dealership, which my family has had a special relationship with for decades.  Amazon had some useful highly negative reviews, which prompted me to check Home Depot and Lowes, which in combination with the repairman noting the new model dropped its warranty period to 1 year as he was suggesting I buy one, prompted me to decide to replace broken parts in my current machine as long as that&#x27;s feasible.<p>Amazon reviews also convinced me not to buy a Speed Queen washer.  They&#x27;re making old fashioned high quality washing machines (i.e. ones that get your clothes clean, it&#x27;s said they bought an old US Maytag factory), BUT their service system is broken, they pay the repairman a flat fee per visit, and if you get a rare lemon you&#x27;re SOL.<p>While this is perhaps costing Amazon money in the short term, it&#x27;s one of many things they do that builds their tremendous brand loyalty, and prompts me to buy more things from and through them than I might otherwise.

Why would a time traveller from the future be discussing &quot;Comet ISON&quot; or &quot;Pope Francis&quot;? According to Wikipedia, comet ISON wasn&#x27;t ever bright enough to spot with the naked eye, and thus left no significant impact on humanity. It&#x27;s obviously too early to decide if Pope Francis will leave a deep, significant impact, but odds are against it.<p>For this methodology to really work, you&#x27;d need to look for mentions of someone like Hitler in the 1920s (and that&#x27;s not even evidence of anything as Hitler was slowly ascending to power during the 1920s). But again, why would a time traveller talk about Hitler then? Presumably a time traveller would either be very, very cautious to not be identified, or not, in which case he&#x27;d likely get himself revealed through carelessness.<p>On the other hand, I find it odd that they brush off analyzing the stock market (or any market, really). A cautious time traveller wouldn&#x27;t buy into the market just before a sudden movement, that would attract way too much attention from insider trade authorities etc. Identify &quot;black swan&quot; events (dot com crash, 2007 financial crash), and look at people who slowly offloaded their assets prior to it.

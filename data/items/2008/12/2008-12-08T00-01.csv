389306,comment,389107,389107,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"I used Tcl in the 1989-1993 timeframe as my default application
configuration language. I stopped doing this when I realized the
maintenance problems I was experiencing with my Tcl-based
configurations were never going to go away.<p>Then for a while I used Apache httpd.conf style markup for configurations.
That worked better but I missed being able to do the macro-style programming
you can easily do in a dynamic language.  I tried XML for a while until 
I realized that it wasn't much better and didn't make things easier.<p>Then I started doing more with Python and Ruby applications and found
that in most cases I could easily just extend whatever configuration
scheme the application used for my purposes.<p>These days I'm using Lua in everything I write that doesn't already
use Python or Ruby for the same kind of things I would have used
Tcl. Lua is efficient, easy to read by others and plays very nice 
with the surrounding environment.<p>So far Lua is working out pretty well but in fairness I spend a lot
more time thinking about configuration issues up front than I did 
20 years ago.",1228696503

It really is a nasty environment for coding non-MS-based software on.<p>If I want to support Windows I have to setup a (virtual) machine <i>with a license code</i> just to have any basic functionality. As someone who doesn't work with Windows anywhere, this is a huge hurdle. Then there's the hoops I'd have to jump through just to get a decent shell and a compiler ready.<p>Oh, but the fun doesn't end there. Which <i>version</i> of Windows are we talking about? More than one? Ah, well, each of these will require its own machine (virtual or otherwise). With matching keys, of course.<p>Supporting Windows is a pain and when it's not required for what I want to do, I'm simply not going to do it. Period. I have better things to do with my time.<p>Letting people who want this code running on Windows do it themselves and having them submit patches upstream is a perfectly valid choice.",1228696482

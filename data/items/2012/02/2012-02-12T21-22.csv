3583166,comment,3582609,3582852,2,0,baddox,,,"You're right that privacy is all about social norms and expectations. That's why I've never understood how people <i>willingly</i> sharing personal information is considered a privacy issue at all. If I show my friend a postcard sent to me by another friend, no one's privacy has been violated. If I trust a roommate (e.g. a significant other) to read my mail, there's no privacy issue there.<p>This applies to a huge portion of privacy concerns raised by the tech community. Someone sharing their photos, location, or thoughts willingly on Facebook does not constitute a privacy issue. Someone accepting a fairly clear Google privacy policy and thereby letting their algorithm read all their emails does not constitute a privacy issue.<p>The <i>real</i> privacy issues are ones where companies don't follow their own privacy policies, or companies' databases get compromised, or companies abruptly change default sharing settings to be more public (which, granted, I believe Facebook has done before).",1329083953

I've always viewed his works as launching points for further work or ideas to consider, but not really definitive.  Most writers who write ""accessible"" science prose are like this, unless they have written some inaccessible work in papers first and are just trying to explain things to the layman.  You take it all with a  grain of salt.<p>With that in mind, I take two concrete appraoches to Gladwell's work.  Unless I feel like reading a story, I skip the anecdotes -- this shortens most of his books to about a chapter's worth. :-)<p>And if I <i>do</i> hit upon an important point I might want to incorporate into my thinking, I look up the references to see how substantiated it really is.",1329083855

Over the years I have tried to learn what I can from various books that I have bought or been given but unless I actually try to use the knowledge it just doesn't stick very well.  Take JavaScript for example.  I can't tell you how many JavaScript books I have read and yet when I sit down to work on something its like I have no idea what I am doing all over again.  Over time my prophecency returns and I am not totally in the dark but the deeper understanding (what I bought the book for in the first place) never arives.  I maintain a basic knowledge of various subjects like PHP, MySQL, and Javascript that I have to resurect anytime I try to use them.  Its simple, unless I am working on something that involves these skills I don't learn anything.  And this is my problem.  For the past several years I have read countless articles on Ruby.  I even bought a Python book.  Two languages that I have a real interest in, but I don't have a clue how to go about actively trying to learn them.  I am hesitant to got the book route becuase I just don't think it will be successful.  Anyone else have this problem?  How have you learned?  I think I should just sit down and make of a list of stuff to program and then try do to it in each language.  Then again this route may cause me to miss something important.  Any suggestions?  Any lists of basic apps you created while learning?",1329083715

Even if its your fault, you regret what happened and want to make amends. Even in that case its better to push off all blame and then go ahead and make amends.<p>This goes for everything from car insurance to dealing with any government body to dealing with corporate workplace issues to dealing with Americans in general.<p>Recently I was struck by this thought when Rex Ryan took the blame for the JETS awful season and in doing so a lot of sports writers questioned whether that was wise because it could mean that another losing season would mean the end of his tenure. A lot of writers mentioned casting the blame on others was a better action for the coach to have followed. Or even to have said nothing at all.",1329083171
3583140,comment,3582674,3583096,3,0,celoyd,,,"I dont think of myself as the HN mainstream, but probably few do.<p>I synthesize these positions on Gladwell.<p>#1, hes not a scientist and not a science journalist. He doesnt apply any rigor to speak of: at best, hes telling suggestive and insightful stories, not proving or really getting to the bottom of anything. He leaves out huge amounts of important information, especially when it would get in the way of making a catchy point. This is extremely irritating when its implied  usually by his readers, not by him  that hes doing something more.<p>But #2, hes good at what he does. If you approach it as engaging stories that highlight quirky research, its entertaining and thought-provoking. Ive learned very little from Gladwell per se, but Ive learned a lot from following up on the actual science that he refers to. Thats valuable.<p>So I think its fair to say that Gladwells scholarship is shoddy, and his writing is shallow and over-popularized and mostly anecdotal. But if you take him as a good storyteller rather than a bad scientist, it can still be worth reading.<p>If you want to like Gladwell but dont, you might prefer John McPhee. Hes a little more on the hard journalism side of the science popularizer spectrum.",1329083136

Secretaries and managers are usually the best at freeing themselves.  She went on, explaining that the hypnotist ""hypnotized"" the audience to select the person they would have on-stage, by convincing them to raise both of their arms, then selecting the person that raised their arms under hypnosis the highest, because they are the one with the greatest connection.

Reading e-mail or whatever other text algorithmically has only one aim - to extract VALUABLE information. It's the nature of the information extracted that defines its value. And the more context this information defines, the more valuable it is. Spam filters also ""read"" emails but they don't care if it is you or me that the e-mail is directed to - the information they gather is not valuable. SMTP servers ""read"" mail headers in order to route the message and pass blindly its content - still no valuable information. But Google is building a highly specific profile of you. It doesn't matter if they do that algorithmically or there is a real person involved reading your mail. Google gains higly contextual information (and the context is YOU) with every message you receive or send. Their algorithms know more about you than you do yourself.<p>I don't mind if AdSense shows me ads for computers when I browse a computer related site.

In this case, possibilities are almost endless and I think you will see five years of strong monetary grow until, of course, everyone will jump ship for something new, more exciting.
Further, Facebook IPO comes in a perfect time. Zuck proved to investors that his idea is sustainable.

Obviously, this all needs to be secured and encrypted. Functionally, the front-end service uses one of the back-ends to verify user identity, the other back-end to store and retrieve site content, and the two back-ends need to communicate occasionally as well. The back-end services have no front-end interfaces at all, being REST services and delivering straight JSON or UBJSON.<p>I had thought that OAuth2 might be the way to go, but the spec is, to say the least, confusing. It also seems designed more for front-end sites to communicate through a back-end channel (eg. Facebook and Twitter), requiring a client-side redirect so the user can authorize the connection.<p>Oauth, on the other hand, doesn't seem designed with that redirect in mind, but it will be the ""old"" tech in a year and I prefer to not have to rewrite the authentication system then.<p>Public/private key is the way Amazon does it, and it's simple to implement, but there is a pile of articles telling me to use OAuth instead.<p>So, finally, the question is: with OAuth2, is it ""legal"" to hide the interaction from the user completely - the three services can communicate securely without the end-user being aware of the existence of the services. Specifically, the user logs into the front-end website, it can check Back-End #1 to verify the user's identity and return his information, then call Back-End #2 for the content that needs to be displayed for the current page.

3582995,comment,3579847,3581834,1,0,tikhonj,,,"There are a couple of things to note about that particular comparison.<p>First, Haskell--particularly on GHC--gives you a ton of options for speeding your code up, including unsafe* functions and pragmas. So the fastest code is going to use things like {-# INLINE #-} and unsafeAt as opposed to ! (the array index operator). However, you would only use these things in performance critical bits of your code.<p>Secondly, the length of the identifier (! vs unsafeAt) actually matters because the benchmarks <i>do not</i> measure the number of lines--they measure the compressed size of the code. [1]<p>[1]: <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/help.php#gzbytes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/help.php#gzbytes</a><p>Finally, these are all small algorithmic problems. The goal is to write the fastest code possible, not something readable or maintainable. Some of the biggest reductions in Haskell come from generalizing and reusing functions in different contexts; I expect this does not happen in the benchmarks because of limited size and the focus on performance.",1329080518

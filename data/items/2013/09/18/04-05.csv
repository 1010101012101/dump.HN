It&#x27;s also possible that drug addicts are from a segment of the population that is more likely to commit suicide, but the drugs medicate away the suicidal urge.<p>You also have a strong selection bias; as mentioned upthread, you haven&#x27;t studied the habitual drug users who <i>didn&#x27;t</i> end up in prison.  There&#x27;s no way the drug market could be as big as the TV news likes to say it is, unless the majority of users were living ordinary lives despite their drug use.<p>Nobody&#x27;s saying that drug addiction should be ignored; they&#x27;re saying that you can treat the problem more effectively by treating society itself rather than trying to prevent access to drugs.",1379480397

Apple/ARM and Intel are quickly converging from two sides  but the cost of switching architectures (while something Apple certainly has been quite good at in the past) seems too high to me for the payoff, and thats even if, spec for spec, ARM could beat out Intel. Add to that that the relationship of Apple with Intel seems to be a quite good one (so there is no reason for petty politics) and I really dont see it happening.<p>24 hour battery life (instead of 12) and half the performance in a MacBook Air seems hardly worth it to me. To my mind that device is already more constrained by performance than battery life.<p>(Conversely I also dont see ARM/Apple getting too slow to keep pace with Intel on the mobile side, so I dont see them switching there to Intel, either.)",1379480314

They target a few key features with every release, absolutely nail those features, and sell the new products perfectly. Their product line-ups and messages are constantly evolving, but slowly, determinedly. And so they achieve things no other company seems capable of - like an unlocking mechanism that is going to be market-defining. Why? Because when the other companies become jealous and try and come up with their own versions, they&#x27;ll rush and release something half-baked, and out of the confusion only Apple&#x27;s solution will speak to consumers.

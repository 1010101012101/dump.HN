6229008,comment,6225104,6228322,1,0,mattzito,,,"If I can make a suggestion from my limited experience dealing with the older folks in my family - there&#x27;s a number of older folks who see the current situation as you age as basically a binary choice: A) you stay home and maintain independence at the risk of having something bad happen to you or b) you go into a assisted living facility and give up your life and independence in exchange for better safety.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to watch how assisted living facilities have been trying to mitigate b).  A number of facilities I&#x27;ve seen recently are structured more as apartments where nurses, doctors, and additional care are on call <i>when needed</i>.  Residents get to design their rooms when they move in, bring in their own furnishings, etc.  It&#x27;s trying to straddle a middle ground between a and b.<p>Similarly, I think amulyte can be marketed to families as peace of mind and care - and to the older folks as independence.

Yes, maybe &quot;white people&quot; have a cushier time with the police and can come back from being a teenage delinquent.  But don&#x27;t kid yourself into thinking the reason there aren&#x27;t more non-white entrepreneurs is because of race.  It&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s because of socioeconomic class.  And in this country, rich white kids outnumber rich black kids by a LOT.<p>See, when you grow up in a wealthy household, you&#x27;re essentially taught that you can get what you want.  It&#x27;s no surprise that wealthy dropout kids want to continue their laziness.  What&#x27;s easier: getting a full time job, or telling mom and dad you have a business idea and living off their cash while you &quot;build&quot; whatever it is you are doing in hopes of scoring big?  Most of these guys will fail, but some will win.<p>Stop making this a thing.  It&#x27;s not about race, it&#x27;s not a &quot;white privilege&quot;.

6228991,comment,6228297,6228618,2,0,mattmanser,,,"That&#x27;s a book that&#x27;s citing sources from over 20 years ago, before unit testing, improved tools, compiler warnings and code analysis tools were even available. Massive changes have happened to the way we code since then. Hell OO had only just started entering the conciousness back then. We&#x27;re not even talking about things like DI, just simple concepts like OO.<p>Code Complete still has many lessons to teach, but it&#x27;s certainly not gospel in this day and age  (unfortunately my copy is buried in some boxes from a move and I can&#x27;t find it at the mo to re-read that chapter!).<p>I personally have seen massive changes to the way we code, people just seem to understand how to split out code into more logical chunks than they used to. Even as recently as 8 years ago, when I start professionally, I remember people used to constantly ask how to pass variables by reference, global variables, all sorts of nastiness that meant that methods weren&#x27;t really being used properly. These days I honestly haven&#x27;t seen a by ref pass or a global variable for years (apart from in an old, truly terrible VB.Net program I&#x27;ve just been given to maintain & update, ugh).<p>Programming really has changed massively. And there certainly are fairly famous proponents of short functions out there, Kent Beck, Robert Martin. It&#x27;s advice that&#x27;s changed over the last 20 years, but I don&#x27;t know whether there&#x27;s studies to back it up, all I can give you is that the general consensus seems to have changed.<p>Back to the point, I certainly don&#x27;t hate long methods, what I hate is methods that do many different things. That&#x27;s just bad code in my book, especially if they start bleeding lines into each other and get jumbled up as tends to happen as your code ages.<p>I admit it&#x27;s very easy to go too far down the rabbit hole, with a massive tree of confusingly nested methods and it&#x27;s a balancing game.<p>But when you see a long function you can usually tell straight away whether it&#x27;s justified or not. Is it doing a complicated thing that justifies a hundred or two hundred lines or is it just doing loads of little simple things.<p>And often if it&#x27;s doing simple things, invariably other functions in the same code file will also be doing those simple things with tiny variations and it can be refactored to reduce the TLOC and improve maintainability when you need to update that functionality. And that&#x27;s usually a sign of a programmer how hasn&#x27;t learnt to do DRY yet and is relatively inexperienced (in the .Net world anyway, I&#x27;m not having a dig at all, I appreciate js still massively changes every year).<p>A function that does one thing and one thing only is:<p>- generally short<p>- testable<p>- name it intelligently and then others don&#x27;t even have to read the code to know what it does<p>- easier to spot bugs<p>- functionality doesn&#x27;t get mixed up<p>- reusable code becomes a lot more obvious<p>Some of these hold especially true with javascript given its lack of block scope.<p>Long functions are generally a strong code smell, in my experience anyway. They generally contain bad code, regardless of whether they&#x27;d have been broken up or not. Functions that start declaring random anonymous objects, which I see a lot in javascript, are especially dubious. It&#x27;s an artefact of javascript&#x27;s design that because it&#x27;s so difficult to declare reusable objects and namespaces and manage code between files a lot of javascript programmers just end up writing these huge blobs of code.<p>As to where I see this happening in javascript, as an example I was reading Meteor.js&#x27;s code the other day and was actually surprised at just how bad the code is. Every function seems to do 5 different things, it declares object right in the middle of functions rather than extracting it out, loads of frankly crazy coding practices.<p>EDIT: In fact, now that I think about it, I remember once using that bit of CC to argue that long functions were better discussing it with a friend. Funny how you can do a complete 180 over time.",1376744943

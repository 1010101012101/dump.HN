Otherwise, don't venture in offering such deal. Essentially, they're kicking out the tail end of the ""distribution"". A lot of SL clients have been reporting network latency and sometimes packet drops over the last few months. SL is most likely seeing this in their MRTG graphs and have no choice but to enforce the ToS, which does have a CDN clause by the way. The right approach would be to expand their network and purchase additional bandwidth. But I guess they're there to increase their margins.<p>I have to confess that, as a provider, one has to anticipate things like this for the sake of keeping the business afloat and the clients. The upstream could at any moment pull the plug on you (literally). There's so much one has to watch out for. These are things one loses sleep over.<p>It's unsettling to say the least. I'm reevaluating SL/UK2 as a possible partner (it used to be high up there in the list but no more).<p>Regards<p>Joe",1292201937

1998704,comment,1996915,1997429,0,0,andfarm,,,"What we're up against is that providing raw numbers for usage limits leads to several problems. Among them:<p>1. Competition. If you provide N gigabytes of storage/bandwidth, another provider will offer N * 2, and they instantly look more competitive, <i>even if</i> they aren't even actually capable of providing that. So, back when we provided limited plans, we were constantly being forced to increase our resource promises to unrealistic levels just to avoid looking stingy.<p>2. Expectations. If you provide N gigabytes of whatever, customers will expect (and demand!) that their site be able to use up all of their provided resources. This is both on a policy level (""what do you mean I saturated the interface?"") and on a technical level (""why can't I serve 100 gigabytes of dynamic HTML a month?"") This becomes an increasing issue as competition drives the provides up, and the actual resources you're supposed to provide are absurdly high. (Consider for instance 100tb.com, which was mentioned earlier in this thread - good luck actually pushing 300+ MBit constantly.)<p>In practice, the policy we've got now actually works better in some ways for customers because they <i>don't have to</i> care whether they're exceeding resource limits, either subjective OR objective.

Yes, every business wants those, but that just delays the real question: what behaviors by your customers will make that happen for you?

The key is having a purpose - working towards it - on and off, all your life - you all know what you are good at. Some of you are excellent communicators, hackers, designers. Some of you don't know yet. That is fine.<p>All of us change the world. Some of us have a bigger platform to do so. All of us can make a bigger platform for ourselves.  Fame, wealth, personal power are all ways to increase our platform. But the best way to increase our platform is to encourage and inspire others, to bring together people, to build a community.<p>For example, do you want to speak at Ted? It's simple but not easy. Become one of the best in the world in your particular field. You can have a much more direct impact by simply taking time to volunteer with those who don't have the skills you take for granted. That's a cliche. But a lot of people don't have your skills and you might be able to work in symbiotic fashion. Similarly, you can ask other people who have the experience, connections, skills for help. People love to help. In fact, it is a psychological conflict that asking someone 'higher' than you for help makes you look better than if you were try to do something for the person higher (asking a favor vs doing something for them).<p>As software developers, as another HN commenter said, we have unprecedented access to power to affect the world, to grab a bit of its attention. Most of us can or know someone who can create a website/app that can be scaled up to be used by thousands of people, within hours of its genesis.<p>Aim for being the local maximum. Be the guy or girl who co-organizes events, throws parties, brings people together. It is very hard to be the global maximum (that is like POTUS - President of the United States). It is definitely attainable to be one of the local maximums (leader, board member, advisor).<p>It is very hard statistically and numerically speaking to be a Mark Zuckerberg or a Jay-Z. They are literally one in hundreds of millions or one of a billion. But you can affect the world around you, in a positive feedback cycle. Stop fearing what you fear and do it.

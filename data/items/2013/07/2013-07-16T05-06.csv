You cite 2 examples:<p><pre><code>   In principle maybe, but, if only it were true. Try telling that to the many people arrested for political protesting, especially those arrested merely for being in proximity of a protest.

So we&#x27;re in agreement about people and their rights.  I guess the only part I don&#x27;t get is the &quot;In principle maybe, but, if only it were true. Try telling that to the many people arrested for political protesting, especially those arrested merely for being in proximity of a protest.
Then there is always the group of people who &quot;choose&quot; to travel by air.&quot;  Are you advocating for limiting the rights of groups to speak/assemble/spend & raise money?  Or are you pointing out that the current system isn&#x27;t great?  I&#x27;ll agree the latter - in my opinion the problem is that there is a concentration of power and massive budget - when there&#x27;s that few people controlling that much money then the incentives will be to try and direct as much of the money towards your special interest as possible.  Restricting groups is treating the symptom, not the cause.",1373954367

Apart from the fact that NT is a MUCH newer OS released later (with 3.1/3.11 being upgrades onto an earlier OS), the system requirements of the two are quite starkly different.<p>For one example, Windows 3.0 runs on 384K of RAM. Windows NT 3.1 runs on 12 megabytes. Windows 3.0 also runs on 8 and 16 bit CPUs, while NT is 32 bit only.<p>If they had released Windows 3.0 as a 32 bit OS Microsoft literally might not exist as they do today, since Windows 3.0 was targeting cheaper IBM clones which were very behind the curve technologically. 32 bit would also have meant perhaps doubling the minimum memory requirement of the system.<p>In general I think very little of your post.",1373953517

It&#x27;s another form of avoidance.<p>Anxiety arises from an underlying emotional issue that someone is avoiding.<p>In the psychedelic and meditative states, it is entirely possible to feel oneness and love for all that is. That&#x27;s fine. For insight meditators, this is a peak experience that is itself transitory. We&#x27;d call this the first &quot;flowering&quot;. There is still much work to reach the &quot;fruit&quot;.<p>Think about it. You&#x27;re given the gift of unity consciousness, of love and light. But, the tendency after that is then select only <i>some</i> of the experience as good, and to reject the rest as bad. The gift of the bliss and love is to teach you what it is like to be unconditionally accepting of all that is.<p>And unconditionally accepting includes the experiences of anxiety, depression, misery ... It&#x27;s only when you accept the <i>experiencing</i> that you can become a complete person.<p>So HN gets in a spate of depression and anxiety discussion. &quot;It drags my mental health down.&quot; The practice at this point is to disassociate the apparent cause and effect and focus on what you are experiencing at the moment. &quot;I feel that my focus is breaking apart.&quot; &quot;I feel my mood going down.&quot; And you go deeper, observing the sensations that make that up: where exactly, in your body, are you feeling it? What color is it? What texture? What temperature? Any sounds, smell, or taste? Then you note it and let it go, go back to focus on living and breathing.<p>Over time, you gain the ability to mindfully observe anxiety or any other sensation as they pass through your awareness, yet you are not moved. It is in this way, the mystics would call &quot;finding your center&quot;. It no longer matters that HN gets in a spate of depression and anxiety discussions. You are OK with that.",1373952022

6050143,comment,6049562,6049562,16,0,hristov,,,"This article shows how the fructose industry is defending itself. Mostly by confusing the issue.<p>The thing about fructose is that it is not by itself poisonous. The problem only comes about for refined fructose, such as that found in cane sugar and HFCS. In those cases, fructose overwhelms the liver and gets processed by wrong pathways which result in all kinds of problems. But if you eat fructose in the form of fruits and vegetables, your body has to take a while to break the fructose out of the fruit and vegetable cells. Thus, your liver only gets a steady trickle of fructose instead of a flood of it. As a result, the liver can process the fructose correctly. Furthermore, if you eat fructose with fiber, molecules from the fiber help the liver process more fructose correctly.<p>Knowing this, it is not difficult to construct an experiment that shows that fructose is not harmful. All you have to do is feed your subjects the correct form of fructose (i.e., fruits and vegetables). The experiment where subjects ate large numbers of apples and were perfectly ok was quite telling.<p>The other defense of the sugar industry is that it is not the sugar, it is the overeating. However, refined sugar causes the overeating. One of the results of processing fructose the wrong way is that the liver does not produce the hormones that are supposed to inform the brain that you are full. Thus, refined fructose causes overeating of sugar and anything else you happen to be eating with your sugar. Personally I know I eat much more fries if I eat them with ketchup and I will eat much more steak if I eat it with steak sauce.<p>The fat people and diabetics are being blamed for eating too much and lacking willpower. They may be partially to blame, but it is very hard to make the correct decision when your brain&#x27;s own sensory mechanisms are being hijacked and tricked. It is very hard to stop eating when you are constantly hungry. But if you cut down on the sugar you will not be constantly hungry, and then you may find that you do not even need that much will power to cut down on your calories.",1373951379

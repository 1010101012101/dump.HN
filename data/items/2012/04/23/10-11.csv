3878161,comment,3878089,3878089,10,0,nirvana,,,"There's a false dichotomy in a lot of these discussions.  There isn't a contradiction between helping society and making money.  Virtually every legal way I know of making money helps society.<p>The money you make comes from somewhere- generally customers who are parting with it.  Why are they parting with it? Because they prefer what you're buying to the alternative.<p>People spend, in the aggregate, because it makes their lives better.  Even hoarders drowning in needless stuff are spending the money to assuage the pain they would feel if they didn't.<p>The vast majority of software has a serious positive impact on the customers lives.  We may wonder about Instagram, but instagram made a LOT of people happy.  Making people happy is a positive benefit to society.<p>Plus, lets remember what money is.  Money is a medium of exchange, its not the thing itself. It is a medium for trading your labor or your intellect.  A ditch digger rents his body out at work in exchange for money.  When he buys shoes, the money is simply they conveyance of the value from digging the ditch to the person selling the shoes.<p>When a software developer uses his brilliance to come up with a new program, he's trading his brainpower for whatever he ends up being with that money.  Money is the medium that enables efficient transactions where barter failed.  That's all.<p>Money is really another way of saying life.<p>People don't trade their life away, generally, except where it is profitable.<p>You make a billion bucks by making something people want?  You've improved their lives probably by 7-9 billion dollars worth.<p>$7 for a movie?  Worth more than $7 in entertainment to the person buying it... or they wouldn't buy it.<p>You don't get to be a millionaire by making people miserable.<p>(and I need to get a blog going, I think my comment is longer than the original article.)",1335178432

3878141,comment,3876983,3876983,3,0,pm215,,,"The trouble with this sort of C coroutine library in my experience is portability. Lthread seems to have taken the ""write a bit of inline asm"" approach, which means it's x86/x86-64 only. If you avoid the assembly and try to do things only with C library functions, you end up with something like QEMU's coroutines, which have four different backends: makecontext/setcontext based, win32 fibers, the nasty sigaltstack trick used by GNU Pth[1], and a last-ditch fallback using a separate GThread per coroutine. Multiple backends means more code, and the less-used backends are more liable to bitrot and undetected bugs, which is the last thing you want in a key bit of infrastructure.<p>Also some libc implementations don't take kindly to programs messing with the stack pointer behind their backs. Early Linux NPTL implementations put thread-local-storage just above the stack and used ""round ESP up to 2MB boundary"" to access it, which meant you had to switch back to the libc-created thread stack before calling just about any libc function. I hear at least one of the BSDs still does something similar.<p>All things considered I'd really rather just use threads...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/rse-pmt.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/rse-pmt.ps</a>",1335177835

I loved to play around with the first 2 levels.<p>It's a pity that the project's state is totally unclear (at least to me, a casual visitor). Is it meant to become a community project? Is it a demo of something that will be sold in the future? The explaining text behind the ""Unlock Levels"" button adds even more confusion:<p><i>> Additional levels are currently being developed for you to play and enjoy. The 3rd level will be available for FREE only for players who sign up for my email list. Sign up now! You'll be notified as soon as the level is up. The level won't be available for unregistered users.</i><p>On the one hand, it sounds as if it is free, with some ""forcing"" to make more users join the project mailing list. On the other hand, this is totally discouraging contributions (because you aren't allowed to see the work-in-progress version), so maybe it's meant to become for-sale in the future.<p>I'd love to see it developing either way (although I think the community way is the more appropriate for this project).

Going so far as to try to pretend that libraries bolted on to other languages give you the same thing at lower cost. This is impossible, and you'd understand that if you understood what erlang does.<p>Stop that, right now. You're supposed to be hackers.  New technology isn't supposed to scare you this much.<p>Erlang doesn't use the C style syntax. BIG WHOOP. Yeah, it looks ""weird"" at first but don't be scared off by it.<p>You can't get the fault tolerance (and consequential scalability) of erlang in any other language/platform.  Period. Full Stop.  It simply doesn't exist.<p>Yeah, theoretically, one could build it with some low level language like C.  You whipping up crappy C++ code using an ""actor"" library is not the same thing, by a long shot.<p>So, unless you want to spend 20 years reinventing the wheel, why not just use the wheel.  Yeah, I know its round and you're used to square.<p>I promise you that you'll really enjoy the much smoother ride.<p>Don't be a blub programmer.  Learning erlang takes you about 2 weeks.  The syntax is perfectly fathomable once you put in those two weeks.<p>But be serious about it.  Do a chapter each night from the armstrong book.<p>This really is one of those languages that separates the hackers from the hacks.

3878071,comment,3876034,3877957,4,0,nirvana,,,"Yes, libertarianism does lead to the rapid advancement of a society from third world conditions to first world conditions, including a rapid and significant improvement in the standard of living for the poorest people in the society, and in fact, in the US, until it was derailed by socialists, much progress in the elimination of poverty itself.  It really is a shame that some people are so jealous of others that they would prefer that an entire society be kept in poverty than risk broadly distributed wealth and some people being obscenely rich.<p>As for gold, I suggest you study the history of money, and economics while you're at it, and pay particularly close attention to the predictions and results of those ""libertarian economists"", the austrians.  It was Mises himself who was laughed at by his fellow austrians when he predicted the Nazis would occupy the country a year hence, only to be proven right.  It was also Mises who predicted the great depression and its cause, prior to it happening. Personally, I made out like a bandit during the housing boom, and bubble, and bursting, all due to being tipped off by the Mises Institute that one was coming, as far back as 2001.   So, go ahead and be smug about gold while the monetary base has gone vertical.  What threat can you be to libertarians when the market has proven us right (and continues to do so)?<p>Seriously, though, your comment is a bunch of assertions, much like mine above. Alas, in the end I made an argument because I'm seemingly incapable of responding without making an argument.<p>There really is no point to posting the things you did about libertarianism.  Libertarians have heard these claims before, and since they're not really honest (and can't be, because reality is far more complex than that) the only real point to them is either to start conflict or to signal to others.<p>Libertarians believe in the non-aggression principle. (In fact this defines libertarianism.) The NAP. This is what they mean by ""treating people like adults.""<p>The initiation of force is immoral.  IF you want to argue against libertarianism, show how it is moral to initiate force.  IF you want to argue against a libertarian policy position, show how it violates the NAP.<p>Don't just vaguely name things that you imagine are scary (""Gilded Age"" for instance) and then assert they are examples of libertarianism.

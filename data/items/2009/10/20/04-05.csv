891795,comment,891622,891700,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"No, it still does apply.  The problem is that when <i>everyone</i> (or at least a lot of people) hoards, it drives down aggregate demand.  <i>Demand doesn't magically appear from nowhere.</i>  Who are the banks going to lend to when no one's buying or selling?  When businesses and individuals both hoard money, there's just less business to be done.  You may have read stories of banks not lending despite the injections of cash into the system!  What do you do when that happens?<p>The problem with the hoarding scenario is that if you know that a greater than X percent of people are hoarding, then you better too because the economy will do worse for it, and you better have a hedge when that happens.  This is called a deflationary spiral.<p>With fiat currency, the central banks can attempt to discourage hoarding by printing money.  However, the amount of money destroyed by the recent financial crash has nearly outpaced the Fed's ability to print money.",1256014591

891793,comment,890795,891587,0,0,pyre,,,"Just curious, do you have some sort of justification for the idea that a gold standard is somehow better than fractional reserve other than the out-dated idea that your dollar has something 'physical' to back it? Gold is just an object the only value that it gets is the value that humans give it.  It's not like gold has some 'inherent' value just for being gold; a value the is constant and unquestionable.<p>Most people that I've talked to that support bringing back the gold standard only have some vague idea of not wanting their money to be 'just paper' and needing to have something 'physical' that backs it. But their thinking never goes any deeper than that. Most of their ideas come off as lacking in thought. Much along the lines of people that keep all their money in cash in a mattress because they ""don't trust the banks;"" never mind that it makes it easier for any corner street thug to break your window and steal all your money.",1256014499
891792,comment,891622,891700,0,0,bokonist,,,"Your view is also antiquidated.  Banking is moving target, the technicalities of the reserve system change frequently.<p>In modern banking the act of depositing is completely severed from the act of lending.  Banks lend based on capital ratios, availability of borrowers, and the Fed's interest rates.  Deposits and reserves no longer matter.<p>Effectively, when you deposit money, you deposit in a 100% reserve account with the Fed.  The Fed as a completely separate action lends money to the banks.<p>Thus last year when people panicked and decided to hoard more, the result was deflation, (not lower interest rates on business loans and mortgages as your model would predict).<p>For further reading:\n<a href=""http://www.winterspeak.com/2009/09/loans-create-deposits-how-banks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.winterspeak.com/2009/09/loans-create-deposits-how...</a><p><a href=""http://www.moslereconomics.com/mandatory-readings/soft-currency-economics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moslereconomics.com/mandatory-readings/soft-curre...</a><p><a href=""http://reservedplace.blogspot.com/2009/04/easing-understanding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reservedplace.blogspot.com/2009/04/easing-understandi...</a><p>And the comment thread between RebelEconomist and JKH here:\n<a href=""http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/2007/05/11/rising-deficit-in-the-us-rising-surplus-in-china/#comments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/2007/05/11/rising-deficit-in-the...</a><p>These folks actually work in banking, and make their living understanding how the system works.

I spend a fair amount of time writing OSX drivers for, erm, non-Jobsian hardware.  With a little hackery (not even programming-level hackery these days), OSX can be remarkably stable on a wide range of system configurations.<p>Specifically, Apple seems to ship (and test?) drivers for a good deal more hardware than you'd expect.  Point example: the 8800GT card that they ship with the Mac Pro--the driver actually works on any 8x00* card, as long as you can disable the check.  The GMA950 driver works on a wide range of Intel cards.  The ATL1e driver works on a lot of Atheros chipsets.  AppleHDA works on a lot of sound cards (If your motherboard has an Intel chipset, it probably works with minimal hackery).  Similar to the way Linux drivers work, OSX drivers tend to cover lots of similar hardware.  So AppleHDA might replace 100 separate windows drivers for separate sound cards, and the big ones even do several chipset <i>companies</i>.<p>Lots of the hardware work (some of which makes it into mainline OSX) is done by the Darwin people.  I've seen tons of straight-up ports from Linux (SpeedStep for non-Core2Duo processors, for example).  There are lots more.<p>All of that to say, the OSX hardware landscape is far beyond the four-at-a-time macs that Apple actually ships.  With respect to driver support, OSX isn't far behind Linux.  I'd put OSX's superior reliability as a consequence of their architecture decisions rather than their (purportedly-lack-of) hardware support.<p>The <i>real</i> sunk cost with hardware support isn't driver development, (paying 4 grad students $400k) but paying people to answer the phones and troubleshoot the devices, paying FedEx to ship the things around, EETs to diagnose and desolder, somebody to write the technical documentation, Geniuses to take tests on the part numbers, etc.  Guarantee Apple tests lots of hardware they never end up shipping because it can't clear the reliability hurdles; all those things need drivers.",1256011552

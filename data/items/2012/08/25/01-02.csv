Usually this means keeping withdrawl at bay.<p>You can be dependent but not addicted.<p>The only difference between drug addiction and an addiction to, say, playing games is that you are not dependent upon the games. In reality however the cost of both are just about equal. The one difference being that many substances will cost you your health directly while games will cost you your health indirectly. In both cases however the psychology is the same and so is the neurobiology. But because games don't literally replace already existing neurotransmitters you don't get dependence. But what you do get with games, just like substances, is your reward pathway being excited to the point where you begin seeking out the thing that excited that pathway over and over.

The best I can come up with would be to hit myself with a hammer occasionally, necessitating treatment of the injury. I'm not sure why people with a public system would deliberately do something like that.<p>I'm not really trying to be facetious. This seems to be one of the ways in which health care isn't like any consumer product: people really <i>do not</i> want as much of it as they can get. In terms of preventative medicine, just getting them to use it can be quite a chore. In terms of treatment of disease or injury, I don't see how using it for its intended purpose qualifies as ""overuse.""",1345856583

4430637,comment,4430020,4430596,14,0,_delirium,,,"I'm not sure about Germany, but in Denmark it's just a service of the state. Doctors' salary, and hospitals' equipment needs, are assessed and negotiated the same way as with other sectors of the public-safety apparatus, such as the police department, fire department, and military. You'd like to keep your hospitals well-stocked, your fire engines maintained and modern, your air force state-of-the-art, etc., but without spending infinite money on any of those, so similar decision-making procedures are used for each. Some services are contracted out to the private sector on a competitive-bidding basis. For example, private companies run a number of the ambulance services, and also the Copenhagen bus system: the government draws up its requirements, solicits bids, and chooses a bidder, who then gets an N-year contract. In addition, there are medical-device manufacturers, both foreign and domestic, who sell on the same competitive-bidding basis. So far the bidding seems to be relatively clean, especially compared to, say, what happens with U.S. defense contractors.<p>Moral hazard doesn't seem to be a large problem with hospital services (doctors aren't going to order an unnecessary surgery), and there is a strong culture against unnecessary prescription drugs. So about the worst that can happen is someone wastes their local physician's time 30 minutes at a time. Since small-time office visits aren't where most of the healthcare costs go (in either Denmark or the U.S.), it's a minor concern. As far as foreigners, that's a concern, and handled by the immigration system (you probably won't get a visa if that's the reason you're trying to enter). The main current concern is intra-EU system-shopping of that sort from Europeans, who don't need visas. There are attempts to standardize something around that (the EU ""blue card"" scheme is one), but it's one of those awkward areas that showcases the EU's quasi-integration. There is also a debate currently about whether Denmark should start charging tourists, since it's one of the few countries that provides completely free emergency care to anyone. Many see this as the right thing to do: if a visitor is injured in a mugging, for example, some people view charging them for the hospital visit as adding insult to injury, like sending them a bill for the police investigation would be. But there is also annoyance that other countries don't reciprocate, so a little bit of a sentiment of, ""well if the bastards are going to charge me for getting mugged in NYC, let's charge them when they come here"".",1345856469

If I want to get in touch with someone - and I don't have their contact details I can probably find them on Facebook and fire them a message.<p>If email was just as easy, people would have probably taken to that.  Which is a shame, because Email could have been that easy.  Privacy used to be more of a concern, and spam drove people away from publishing their addresses in directories.<p>I've left (privacy and personal reasons.)  I since have missed the community.  It's encouraged me to pick up the phone more, which is a nice thing.  You just can't have the same rich interaction with people when typing compared to talking.   But you can have a greater audience.  Perhaps you communicate to more people with less content over something like Facebook, compared to having richer relationships with fewer people.  It might all balance out.<p>Ultimately time is a premium.  I certainly don't think G+ is the answer - it's much of the same.",1340891967

But as pointed out in another comment it's just one day I had to sit for an hour and put everyone who I don't speak on phone regularly as acquaintances. Problem solved!<p>It was a bit hard for me to do this though, nearly took an hour.. so here are two suggestions<p>1) Brute force: option to mark everyone as acquaintances in one go and then de-select the people back to friends.<p>2) More automated: Facebook should make a module where if a person allows the app access to the phonebook, it somehow recommends a list of people who are important to me based on my frequency of calling/speaking them offline. I know privacy conscious people would absolutely scream in horror so this is why it should be opt-in only.<p>P.S. 3) Oh and timeline still sucks.

4171686,comment,4170398,4171432,4,0,Kell,,,"I'm sorry, but you have a terrible conception of Justice.<p>We should never think that prison ""should"" be the solution for anything. That's the reason there is 4.5 times more persons in prison per capita in US than in NZ [1].<p>In continental Europe we tend to consider that prison is there as a punishment for really severe things (killings, sexual abuse, severe drug trafficking etc.) OR a way to avoid reiteration. If there is no risk of reiteration and the damage was light, then fines and other non-socially disruptive punishments are better suited.<p>And your conception that : private citizens always end up in prison so should government representatives, is wrong. If private citizens always end up in prison, then that's a problem that should be solved... not ampliated by putting more people behind the bars. Your vision almost sounds to me like a bitter revenge : ""Hiii, we pooooor citizens always go to jail, they should taste their own medicine"". No, the least prison, the better.<p>The best example of this is your terrible transformation of an important Judicial principle. You wrote : Better a few government employees behind bars ""unfairly"" than more than a few citizens behind bars ""unfairly"".<p>Dude. Read yourself. There is no way, people behind the bars unfairly is better than anything. It's the wrost thing. Remember the Blackstone Principle : ""better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer"".<p>And finally, do not forget that police is by essence making mistakes, it's impossible not to do, because they do something called investigation. If they were only to act in full certainty, then they would almost never act. They gather data and facts about a possible crime, and they have to use force to do that, and then they send all of this to a judge who will decide if there is enough to effectively find someone guilty or not. What you are asking for, is that police only act when they're so certain of the guilt that there is almost no need anymore for a trial. The judicial system cannot work like that. You must allow police force to make mistakes... or we're going to end up with police acting like Judge Dredd.<p>Which by the way does not mean there is not going to be any punishment, and if they do some really grave trespassing, then they might even end up in prison. It's a question of scale.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_pri_per_cap-crime-prisoners-per-capita"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_pri_per_cap-crime-pris...</a>",1340891845

Namun Pengobatan Darah Tinggi Alami lebih baik dibandingkan denagn pengobatan lainnya karena Pengobatan Darah Tinggi Alami ini menggunakan bahan yang alami tanpa bahan pengawet dan zat yang berbau kimia. sehingga Pengobatan Darah Tinggi Alami dapat di ikuti oleh sejumlah kalagan muda maupun tua.\nDarah Tinggi ( Hipertensi )<p>Tekanan darah tinggi atau hipertensi adalah kondisi medis di mana terjadi peningkatan tekanan darah secara kronis (dalam jangka waktu lama). Penderita yang mempunyai sekurang-kurangnya tiga bacaan tekanan darah yang melebihi 140/90 mmHg saat istirahat diperkirakan mempunyai keadaan darah tinggi. Tekanan darah yang selalu tinggi adalah salah satu faktor risiko untuk stroke, serangan jantung, gagal jantung dan aneurisma arterial, dan merupakan penyebab utama gagal jantung kronis.<p>Pada pemeriksaan tekanan darah akan didapat dua angka. Angka yang lebih tinggi diperoleh pada saat jantung berkontraksi (sistolik), angka yang lebih rendah diperoleh pada saat jantung berelaksasi (diastolik). Tekanan darah kurang dari 120/80 mmHg didefinisikan sebagai ""normal"". Pada tekanan darah tinggi, biasanya terjadi kenaikan tekanan sistolik dan diastolik. Hipertensi biasanya terjadi pada tekanan darah 140/90 mmHg atau ke atas, diukur di kedua lengan tiga kali dalam jangka beberapa minggu.<p>Sejalan dengan bertambahnya usia, hampir setiap orang mengalami kenaikan tekanan darah; tekanan sistolik terus meningkat sampai usia 80 tahun dan tekanan diastolik terus meningkat sampai usia 55-60 tahun, kemudian berkurang secara perlahan atau bahkan menurun drastis.\nDalam pasien dengan diabetes mellitus atau penyakit ginjal, penelitian telah menunjukkan bahwa tekanan darah di atas 130/80 mmHg harus dianggap sebagai faktor risiko dan sebaiknya diberikan perawatan.\nPengobatan Darah Tinggi Alami solusi tepat untuk mengobati darah tinggi yang sangat baik untuk menyembuhkan darah tinggi secara alami.<p>Jika anda bertanya mengapa di sebut Pengobatan Darah Tinggi Alami?? Jawabannya : Karena pengobatan ini menggunakan bahan yang alami terbuat dari Daun sirsak dan kulit manggis yang sangat baik utuk menyembuhkan darah tinggi. seiring dengan kemajauan tekhnologi dan ilmu kesehatan zat yang terkandung dalam daun sirsak dan kulit manggis ini di proses dan digabungkan sehingga menjadi satu kemasan Ace Maxs berukuran 350 ml yang mampu mengobati darah tinggi secara alami.<p>Manfaat Kulit Manggis dalam Obat Alami Ace Maxs\nBenarkah kulit manggis yang rasanya pahit mempunyai khasiat? Mungkin selama ini anda mengira bahwa cuma buahnya saja yang punya banyak khasiat. Namun ternyata, kulit manggis pun bisa dimanfaatkan untuk mengobati berbagai macam penyakit kronis seperti kanker, jantung, diabetes, darah tinggi, kolesterol dll.<p>Ternyata pada kulit buah manggis mengandung suatu senyawa xanthone, yaitu zat antioksidan yang dapat melawan radikal bebas. Beberapa penelitian menunjukkan, senyawa ini memiliki sifat sebagai antidiabetes, antikanker, anti peradangan, antibakteri, antifungi, antiplasmodial, dan meningkatkan kekebalan tubuh.\nManfaat lain yang bisa didapat dari kulit manggis adalah untuk mengobati sariawan. Anda semua pasti pernah dong mengalami penyakit yang satu ini. Gejalanya diantaranya adalah bibir pecah-pecah dan terasa panas dan perih, tenggorokan terasa gatal namun bukan karena ingin batuk. Begitu banyaknya khasiat manggis mulai dari buah sampai kulitnya merupakan anugerah yang sangat besar dari sang pencipta yang wajib kita syukuri.<p>Manfaat daun sirsak dalam Obat Alami Ace Maxs\nBukti sejarah memperlihatkan khasiat daun sirsak ini telah diketahui oleh bangsa Indian kuno yang mempergunakan daun sirsak untuk menyembuhkan penyakit jantung , asma, liver dan reumatik. Dari fakta itu kemudian bermunculan penelitian yang berusaha mengungkap khasiat daun sirsak untuk kanker. Hasil penelitiannya sangat luar biasa, daun sirsak menyimpan potensi yang besar untuk menjadi Pengobatan Darah Tinggi Alami.\nSebelum tahun 1970, berbagai studi para ilmuwan membuktikan ekstrak pohon sirsak berkhasiat lebih baik dari kemoterapi, bahkan ekstrak tersebut bisa memperlambat pertumbuhan kanker. National Cancer Institute telah banyak melakukan penelitian ilmiah pada 1976 dan hasilnya menyatakan batang dan daun sirsak efektif menyerang dan menghancurkan sel-sel kanker.\nPenelitian yang dilakukan di Korea juga menemukan bahwa ada satu senyawa kimia yang ditemukan dalam sirsak, berperan selektif membunuh sel kanker usus besar serta 10.000 kali lebih berpotensi sebagai obat kemoterapi. Selain itu juga diketahui senyawa ini selektif memilih sel target kanker sehingga tidak merusak sel-sel yang sehat.\nAce Maxs sebagai obat darah tinggi alami secara klinis Nasional dan Internasiaonal terbukti berkhasiat tinggi. Selain berfungsi untuk mengobati penyakit ringan maupun berat juga bisa dikonsumsi sehari-hari sebagai minuman kesehatan dari alam untuk menjaga dan merawat kesehatan agar tetap penuh vitalitas.<p>Jangan biarkan darah itnggi anda sebelum terjadi sesuatu yang lebih parah lagi, obati segera dengan Obat alami yang tidak mengandung zat kimia terbuat dari daun sirsak dan kulit manggis dalam kemasan Ace Maxs yang mampu mengobati darah tinggi dengan alami.\nUntuk informasi pemesanan KLIK DISINI, atau untuk informasi lebih lanjut anda bisa menghubungi di nomor 085.310.460.219",1340891781

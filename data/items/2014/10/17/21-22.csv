And like you say, it can be understood in terms of voice leading, e.g.the 7th (the &quot;leading tone&quot;!) &quot;wants&quot; to resolve up to the tonic.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that you mentioned motif because I think that fits well with what I was saying about the length of the pieces. Seems to me that one isn&#x27;t going to have much room to develop motifs unless writing in an extended form. But for me personally, this doesn&#x27;t seem like a good requirement for a piece to be satisfying in the way that I think we are talking about. If you are seeking that kind of intricacy from modern music, have you checked out Bela Fleck & the Flecktones? Also, have you explored Zappa at all?",1413583184

8473581,comment,8472157,8473413,0,0,baddox,,,"Out of curiosity, have you studied just intonation? I&#x27;m currently reading the mostly excellent Haromonic Experience [0]. I&#x27;m reasonably well educated on music theory, but I had never looked into just intonation and the way <i>frequency</i> relates to our perception of pitch and harmony. I&#x27;m finding this stuff enlightening.<p>An ideal string (or any oscillator) when disturbed (e.g. plucked) will tend to vibrate at a fundamental frequency of x Hz as well as modes of 2x, 3x, 4x, etc. These higher frequencies at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency are called harmonic partials. This is a physical phenomena unrelated to music and human hearing.<p>But the basic elements of harmony come from the fact that our auditory system seems to be &quot;tuned&quot; to identify harmonic partials.<p>If we start with a fundamental frequency x Hz (let&#x27;s call it C), the first partial is 2x Hz, and it is another C an octave above (multiplying or dividing a pitch by a power of 2 will give you the same pitch in another octave).<p>The next partial is 3x Hz, and it sounds like a G. This is the interval called a perfect fifth, and is the strongest, most stable sounding interval (other than the octave). The next partial is 4x Hz, which is just another C, two octaves above the C we started with.<p>The next partial is 5x Hz, which sounds like an E. This is a major third, which is another strong and stable interval which is ubiquitous in most music.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0892815604/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0892815604/ref=oh_aui_detai...</a>",1413583136

8473527,comment,8472157,8473460,0,0,archagon,,,"Classical music theory is a rigid, structural, almost mathematical system that emerged over several centuries. In those centuries, composers learned some very powerful techniques to express ideas in their music. Although the specifics of classical music — the rhythms, the chords, the tonalities — may be antiquated, I really do think that the forces that guided their development are just as relevant to modern music. For example: why is a V7 chord so powerful? It&#x27;s because you have the interval of a 5th — a tense interval with almost universal meaning vis a vis the overtone series — combined with two minor 2nd intervals that are <i>brimming</i> with tension to resolve to the tonic and the third. The study of intervals and of tension in voice leading is, I think, absolutely essential in jazz as well, and can help explain some extremely confusing jazz chords in analysis as almost incidental results of voice leading. This is what I mean by classical music theory offering insight into any genre of music: classical music emerged out of the study of things like intervalic tension, and even though our own century&#x27;s music has diverged from this origin, I think it&#x27;s very important to study the lessons learned over those hundreds of years.<p>(EDIT: I just noticed that you said outside of Western music. Yes, that may be correct. Many systems of music in the world are very different from our own. But I think most people writing music today are writing with Western ears in mind. After all, we&#x27;ve been conditioned to understand this kind of music for hundreds of years!)<p>As for your second point, I think what I latch on to in classical music more than anything is the use of motif, and Beethoven&#x27;s 5th of course epitomizes this. Don&#x27;t get me wrong — I love popular music, and I listen to it more than anything — but most of the &quot;top 100&quot; songs in any popular music ranking feature wandering, improvised music more than any systemic use of motif to make a rhetorical point. And that&#x27;s not a bad thing! I love Stairway to Heaven. But it just &quot;sounds good&quot; — it doesn&#x27;t really develop its musical material.<p>Compare to something like this[1], where <i>every single musical detail</i> is repeated and developed across all the voices. It&#x27;s so intricate. I&#x27;ve never heard this level of motivic development in popular music, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a few years now.<p>I am sorry if this is not making any sense, I am having beers.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLotW5AKjg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLotW5AKjg</a>",1413582195

It makes relativity really easy to understand, but it makes entropy comparably harder (since the premise of entropy is that our uncertainties multiply due to particle collisions until things end up in more and more uncertain states). It <i>almost</i> sounds like there&#x27;s no free will in this perspective, but that&#x27;s not quite true. Instead you get a model of free will which is a lot like you see in the movie The Matrix: &quot;Because you didn&#x27;t come here to make the choice, you&#x27;ve already made it. You&#x27;re here to try to understand <i>why</i> you made it.&quot;<p>Relativity does not necessarily <i>compel</i> this. It is true, the relativistic &quot;present&quot; is a space between two light cones, and not just one plane. But that&#x27;s not necessarily a huge obstacle: we can just pretend that there is one plane which is the &quot;true present&quot; and accept that the laws of physics make it impossible to know if we&#x27;re truly right about which it is. As long as <i>one</i> of the planes is the true present you can lift up the Newtonian way of looking at time to the special-relativistic whole.<p>It turns out that black holes aren&#x27;t really so interesting as this article claims, because there is a &#x27;co-moving&#x27; metric which falls into the black hole&#x27;s event horizon in a finite time. What happens with a black hole is, you see someone slow down more and more to a standstill as they approach the event horizon, appearing to &quot;merge in&quot; with that surface, redshifting into the quantum noise of the Hawking radiation there. But from their perspective, you&#x27;re just seeing their &quot;last moment in this universe&quot;; they&#x27;ll keep going on past that horizon.<p>But general relativity <i>is</i> still a problem. It describes the causal fabric of the universe as warped by the energies that inhabit each part of that fabric, and that makes it really hard to deal with time. Some of the interesting stuff here comes either from (a) alternative descriptions of relativity (like spinors/twistors, where you describe the entire world-line of a particle as a point), or (b) quantum mechanics (where you can do multiple-universe-splitting). The combination of relativity and quantum mechanics, for example, seems to give us the Wheeler-de Witt equation, which time famously &quot;falls out&quot; of (it plays no final role in the equation). Some physicists, notably Julian Barbour, think that this means we&#x27;ve got to fixate on a static universe. I&#x27;m totally undecided on this but I find it fascinating.",1413581482

However, that bug got fixed decades ago.<p>In the case of ETFs, they are priced by the market, so there&#x27;s no such thing as the ETF itself being slow to update its price.<p>EDIT: Actually, I think instead of &quot;their purchase price&quot; you mean &quot;their order limits&quot;.  In most major equity exchanges, one doesn&#x27;t know who&#x27;s on the other side of the trades, so one wouldn&#x27;t &quot;find a hedge fund&quot; to trade against, but rather &quot;find a pattern of trades&quot; to trade against.  One typically wouldn&#x27;t know if that pattern represented a hedge fund, a bank, etc., or maybe several different market participants that in aggregate produced an exploitable trading pattern.",1413581135

Studying the history of Western music theory doesn&#x27;t give you insight into <i>any</i> music, as you claim. It gives you insight into Western music. Check out music from another part of the world with a completely different notion of tuning, different scales, etc, and your music theory background isn&#x27;t going to help very much. The only thing that is truly universal is the overtone series, because that&#x27;s based on physics.<p>2. I think we could come up with plenty of structurally complex music from recent idioms, particularly jazz and jazz-influenced music. I would say that a bigger difference between something like, I dunno, Steely Dan, and Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth, is length. Popular musicians don&#x27;t seem to attempt such longer pieces. But for me personally, longer != more powerful. For that matter, more complex != more powerful, but I happen to share your desire for what we&#x27;re calling &quot;compositional depth&quot;, whatever that may be...",1413581081

What makes a V7 chord work? Where did augmented 6th chords come from? How did the Neapolitan chord fit into these systems? By looking at the progression of music history from one-voice chants to counterpoint to harmony and then to the explosion of ideas in the Romantic era and beyond, you acquire the skills to know why music — <i>any</i> music — can sound good and express rhetorical ideas.<p>With a foundation in classical music theory, you can go beyond what anyone is doing in popular music today. I strongly believe that (for example) Beethoven&#x27;s 5th, from a compositional perspective, has more rhetorical power than any music produced in the last century. I think this is largely due to popular music being very simple structurally. Where is the counterpoint? Where are the modulations? All we get is simple chord progressions repeated ad nauseum.

It does not require virtualization by default, it talks directly to the Docker API (so you can use it directly on Linux without boot2docker/VirtualBox).  It is useful because previously people were writing their own custom little Bash scripts etc. to bootstrap containers for e.g. a PHP app to run app code, a MySQL database, a redis instance and an instance of nginx to serve static files which are all meant to be tied together and work together in a specific way.  One of the goals of docker is &quot;one concern per container&quot; so this helps people to use it in the right way and you don&#x27;t have to, say, restart your database to restart your app (like you would if you crammed them all into one container).<p>Vagrant is a general purpose tool for automation and management of virtual machines written in Ruby. You specify configuration in Ruby.  One of its goals is choice, so it has swappable &quot;drivers&quot; (so that you can use different hypervisors such as VirtualBox, Fusion, and HyperV) and &quot;provisioners&quot; (for installing software etc. when you bootstrap a new VM).

8473380,comment,8464532,8472418,0,0,enoch_r,,,"Thanks for responding, I appreciate the interesting discussion. :)<p>You began this sub-thread by making the following claim:<p>> It&#x27;s only at the risk-free rate of return that the two products you describe are of equal value. In order to realize returns higher than the risk-free rate, investors must do work. I think that the extra gain beyond the risk-free rate should be taxed as ordinary income, because that&#x27;s really what it is: income produced by work.<p>With this in mind, look at the following table, based on historical returns since 1928:[0]<p><pre><code>                Stocks  TBills  TBonds\n    Arith avg.  11.50%  3.57%   5.21%\n    Geo avg.    9.55%   3.53%   4.93%\n    Std Dev     20.02%  3.06%   7.85%\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s say your time horizon is 10 years. You have at least four options:<p>1. Buy $1000 worth of equity ETFs. Sell them in 10 years. Expected value: $2,489.57. Expected tax paid: $223.44 (22%).<p>2. Buy $1000 worth of T bill ETFs. Sell them in 10 years. Expected value: $1,414.69. Expected tax paid: $62.20 (6.2%).<p>3. Buy $1000 worth of T bond ETFs. Sell them in 10 years. Expected value: $1,618.07. Expected tax paid: $92.71 (9.2%).<p>4. Hold $1000 worth of cash. Expected value: $1,000. Expected tax paid: $0 (0%).<p>Do these four products have unequal present values? No, they are equally valued at $1000, despite the fact that stocks have a higher expected return, because people are risk averse.<p>Are some of these products likely to realize returns higher than the risk-free rate? Yes--riskier assets typically pay a risk premium.[1]<p>Does investing in stocks require more work than investing in T bills or bonds? No.<p>Does investing in stocks require more work than investing in bonds, where &quot;work&quot; is defined as &quot;possessing knowledge of, and acting on, the fact that higher risk assets typically have higher returns&quot;? No, such knowledge is neither necessary nor sufficient. Unnecessary because plenty of people invest in stocks without any underlying research because they&#x27;ve been told to do so, or pay someone else to manage their money for them. Insufficient because plenty of people prefer the stability of lower-risk assets to stocks&#x27; higher expected return.<p>Look, I don&#x27;t work in finance either. I&#x27;m a software developer. I try to save money, and when I do, I throw it into an ETF that tracks the market as a whole. I don&#x27;t try to time the market. I don&#x27;t try to identify growth markets or over- or under-performance of asset classes. If I wanted risk-free returns, I could use the time I spend logging into my brokerage account and buying equity ETFs to instead... log into my brokerage account and buy bond ETFs. Or I could use that time to log into a savings account and transfer money over from a checking account. I completely reject the idea that my personal decision to purchase stocks instead of bonds is <i>work</i>.<p>If you want to change your position to claim that taxation should discourage risk-taking, I strongly disagree, but that&#x27;s a different argument entirely.<p>[0] <a href=""http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_premium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_premium</a>",1413580029

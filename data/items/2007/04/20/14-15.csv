You say you prefer PHP, but when was the last time you looked at the source code for any of the myriad extensions? Can you explain how mod_php works within apache?<p>Whilst I do think that it's good to have a broad view of how things fit together, knowing what every line of code is doing says to me that you are either working on incredibly trivial code, and/or you're not using existing, well-tested libraries as much as you could be.",1177081191

15073,comment,15029,15029,0,0,cwilbur,,,"The goals they have are good ones.  If you're stuck with more than 10 programmers of varying levels of ability, and you're taking marching orders from a client who has no idea what the tradeoffs are, they're arguably the best way to get things done.<p>When you're a group of fewer than 5 programmers and you're all smarter than the average bear, they're useless.<p>In essence, they're a ritualization of the communication and testing process that has to happen to make software good and reliable.  Without some communication and testing, the software will suck; at a certain organizational size, or with programmers of lower ability levels, you can't rely on the programmers to do it themselves.",1177080790

I abide by it at work and it's generally a huge bottleneck for all projects.  Many of the ideas the SEI proposes are good practice, and I have a feeling a lot of developers already follow them without knowing that they're part of any ""process"".  <p>A bad implementation of CMMI at an organization only makes things worse.  For example, the latest version of CMMI encourages us to engage in rapid feedback cycles with customers, which is great.  But the system we're supposed to <i>track</i> when and how we did that is clunky and consumes time, to the point that you don't <i>want</i> to go talk to customers for fear of having to do more writing and documenation.",1177078310

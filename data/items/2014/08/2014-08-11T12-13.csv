If you don&#x27;t want the office politics drama of not picking up a load to FL, don&#x27;t do business with a place that has loads to FL, its that simple.  I seem to recall hearing he had a deal with a franchise farm equipment dealer where by definition he never went out of the dealership territory other than occasional horse trading between dealerships.  When he got sick of living in Iowa he moved on.<p>Much like the computer biz, life is better if you&#x27;re not in the middle of it.  Not being in the middle of everything meant feast or famine, which was OK for him.<p>He was retired, sorta, but still needed 90s era health insurance premiums (which I&#x27;m sure was comically low compared to current costs) and he wanted to avoid 401K early withdrawal penalties, so he only worked for restaurant and bar money.  That kind of personal financial position helps a lot when looking for quality of life.  If you demand 10% more pay than everything else, they&#x27;ll pay it, but take it right outta your hide, horrible working conditions and bad routes.  Better to love life at 50% of income than to exhaustively minmax up to 110% of income and hate every millisecond of it.<p>Most &quot;IT type positions&quot; would not be amused if you decided not to work that month because you have enough cash for now.  But trucking was (is?) flexible.<p>There is a bias in the truck driving biz that is the opposite of &quot;IT type work&quot; where its assumed that an old guy will naturally be more reliable, harder working, and more knowledgeable about trucks and routes and just generally a better overall trucker.  In that way it can be a decent second career.<p>He claimed that once him and his wife saw the country, it got pretty boring.  I imagine anything can become boring, eventually.  So it might be super exciting for only a decade, after which &quot;eh&quot;.<p>Some other advice is there are downsides of exotic travel.  I live in a state with no known non-escaped pet poisonous snakes and only one species of venomous spider.  You go trucking in the deep south and you&#x27;ll inevitably meet some kind of swamp animal that can kill you.  Also as a Midwestern boy, suddenly after decades of not caring, having to be really careful about hurricanes on coastal runs was weird.  On the other hand, when he got fed up with visiting an area, in only a couple days he could be back in the western mountains.  Thinking of geography in terms of time not distance was another anecdote he talked about.  No matter how hot it was in Louisiana he could be back &quot;home&quot; so to speak in North Dakota in a couple days.  His relatives (us) treated him like a sailor who could be gone for months and needs years of warning for a wedding, but crazily enough he could get around faster than people with &quot;normal&quot; desk jobs when he had to (sick relative, whatever).<p>He got tired of his truck after a decade or so just like you&#x27;d get tired of a house.  Truck dealerships make some commission just on people getting tired of the layout and windows, just like houses.<p>I wasn&#x27;t super close to him but there was some weirdness in the 90s such that his retirement fund was somehow available to him with lower (no?) penalties because he bought a truck with it.  Or maybe it was accounting BS and he figured once he made 10% of the cost of the truck in profit (which didn&#x27;t take long) that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t paying a penalty on his withdrawal&quot; even though technically on paper he did.  This is complicated and worthy of some research if you&#x27;re serious.  I wasn&#x27;t close enough to him to talk taxes and accounting but I&#x27;m sure basically setting up a small business is an interesting topic.  (Oh and edited to add he had some tax weirdness where he was basically homeless but it turns out renting an apartment in an income-tax-free state was cheaper than paying income tax in a income taxing state, I&#x27;d talk to a real tax accountant about that before renting anything or filing anything)",1407760924

Still, that’s not bad.<p>It&#x27;s a good start, but still not nearly &quot;grid scale cost&quot;, and you&#x27;re only getting electricity at that price when the sun is out.  Not suitable for base-load generation, but for peaking.  Useful, but not 100% availability useful.<p>Re: Natural gas - it depends.  Prices fluctuate, so it goes both ways.  There have been times where gas was much cheaper than many options, only to become a very expensive choice because prices went up.  Imagine how the plant owners feel when they build a facility while prices are at one level, only to have to operate it at a higher price later!<p>The flexibility that combustion turbine plants bring to the grid, however, make them good choices as they have short startup times, work well as spinning reserves, and these days aren&#x27;t too expensive to operate.  When the fuel comes from within our borders, it is good for national security, too.<p>A bigger thing hurting greener competitors is bad information and idealistic proposals that do not have practical engineering foundations.  I&#x27;m still making my way through the paper, but I&#x27;m incredibly skeptical these guys really understand <i>the grid</i> (grid grid grid) and how it&#x27;s really put together.<p>Remember, the goal behind the grid is to provide very reliable power to customers at a decent price, and operate the utility at a profit.  Consumers don&#x27;t usually care where their energy comes from, but obviously &quot;feel better&quot; if it&#x27;s from environmentally friendly sources.  The &quot;early adopters&quot; among us might go for higher prices for cleaner energy, but no &quot;mass market&quot; consumer is going to accept lower grid reliability in exchange for a greener power supply or comparatively higher prices for a &quot;greener&quot; one.",1407758996

8162911,comment,8161604,8162704,6,0,sillysaurus3,,,"A double can store every integer from -2^53 to 2^53, which seems sufficient to do financial work.<p>2^53 is 9,007,199,254,740,992<p>If you want to denote that the last three digits are for fractional dollars (i.e. each integer represents 1/10th of a penny) then you can store any monetary value from -$9 trillion to $9 trillion.<p>EDIT:  Note that it&#x27;s tempting to think that you can skip converting decimal currency to integer as long as you only use <= 3 digits after the decimal and you&#x27;re storing values of less than 9 trillion, i.e. it&#x27;s tempting to think you&#x27;re safe storing a value like $1,283.212 directly in a double without converting to integer.  But I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s mistaken.  You always need to convert to integer so that you&#x27;re storing 1,283,282 in a double, not $1,283.212<p>The reason is because certain decimal values which can be represented in base 10 can&#x27;t be represented in base 2.  For example, $0.1 can&#x27;t be stored into a double as-is; if you try to store 0.1 into a double, you&#x27;ll get:<p><pre><code>  0.1000000000000000055511...\n</code></pre>\nwhich is where the inaccuracies can start to come into play.  Whereas if you convert $0.1 to integer, you&#x27;ll be storing the value 100 into a double, which comes out to exactly 100 without any error.<p>Of course, the error may be so small as to be insignificant, but the point is, I&#x27;m absolutely certain that integers between -2^53 and 2^53 can be perfectly represented by doubles, but I&#x27;m not certain that <= 3 digits of decimal precision can always be accurately represented by doubles for values of less than 9 trillion.<p>EDIT2: You have to be careful when converting between currencies, too.  For example, right now $2 = 204 yen.  If you&#x27;re storing yen, 2^53 yen is different from 2^53 one-tenth-pennies, so the max value that you can store is specific to each currency.  This seems like potentially a tricky problem, and may be what the parent commenter was referring to when saying doubles aren&#x27;t so good for financial work.  Still, though, 2^53 integers of precision may be sufficient regardless of which currency you&#x27;re using.",1407758985

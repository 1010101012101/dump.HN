4679497,comment,4677893,4677893,3,0,ambrop7,,,"The ""simple"" code completely breaks with cross-compilation. This is because the autoconf macros will first look for the CHOST-pkg-config program (e.g. armv6j-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi-pkg-config), which will normally be a wrapper around pkg-config specifying PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR to make pkg-config look for stuff in the target prefix instead of the host. For example, Gentoo's ""crossdev"" tool automatically generates such a wrapper.<p>So if we all just start ""simplifying"" the code like that, we'll end up with lots of cross-compile breakages for packages which cross compiled all right before, and I suppose many people will find the best fix to just revert to using the autoconf macros again, as opposed to hardcoding the procedure for finding the right pkg-config.",1350820685

4679473,comment,4679138,4679416,28,0,skrebbel,,,"Your post is full of FUD, taste mixed with fact, and little incorrectnesses. Most notably, your post seems to imply that for C# to be worth something, it has to be the best at something. Yet, Scheme is a prettier language (taste, not fact), a whole bunch of languages already had continuations, a whole bunch of other languages are faster, and so on. C# is great because it's above-average good at all of these areas.<p>C# has <i>one of the best</i> standard libraries out there (well documented, rather well designed, batteries-included, etc)<p>C# has a decent set of relatively modern language constructs, yet is easy enough to learn for a very large group of programmers.<p>C# is faster than most (but not all) languages sporting a comparable set of high-level features.<p>C# has excellent tool support, and was designed for <i>enabling</i> such tool support, making refactoring and code navigating easier than in any other language except Java.<p>C# has a large ecosystem and user-base, making it easy to find answers to problems and components that solve problems not covered by its standard library.<p>None of these items, in isolation, are special. Java arguably has a stronger ecosystem, but is a less powerful language. C++ is faster, Scheme is more elegant (according to many), and so on. But I know of no other language that has all these areas covered so well <i>simultaneously</i>. Scala comes close, but is arguably more difficult to learn, and lacks on the ecosystem area (not in terms of library support, but in terms of best practices and large user base). This might change, which would be lovely.<p>All other languages you mentioned strongly lack on at least one of the above-mentioned aspects.<p>I'm not saying that C# is god's gift to mankind and the only good thing out there. I'm only saying that you're dismissing it too easily.<p>There are sufficient people out there who really like this combination of features to support a vibrant open source community. Which is why this community exists. Why dismiss something that exists and works well?",1350819496

4679468,comment,4679150,4679150,5,0,beloch,,,"There are several conflicts of interest here.<p>Companies that both search for copyright violators and provide internet service (e.g. Time Warner) will be strongly motivated to send out massive amounts of spurious warnings to their own users.  By doing so, they can effectively throttle anyone using large amounts of bandwidth even if it isn't for illegal file sharing.  The review fees will also allow providers to ""tax"" high-bandwidth users unwilling to be throttled.  i.e. If a user requests a review their ISP can pocket the fee and simply throw out the warning without wasting any resources actually reviewing it, only to send another warning the following month.<p>The truly diabolical aspect of this policy is that the copyright owners do the ""monitoring"".  While using spurious warnings to cut bandwidth costs and squeeze more fees out of their own users, they can also issue just as many warnings against users of other ISP's to ensure that there is no benefit to switching providers.  It is even possible that some companies may actually send out massive amounts of spurious warnings to users of competing ISP's as a way of pressuring them to switch ISP's.<p>Solutions?  There needs to be a sufficiently strong penalty for issuing warnings that aren't valid.",1350819044

4679464,comment,4679365,4679365,73,0,jdietrich,,,"This piece is blatant anti-Iranian propaganda, because it fails to give any context for the events of 1979. It entirely omits any reason why Americans became unwelcome in Iran. The islamic revolution occurred in Iran as a direct result of the hostile actions of the CIA, who in 1953 overthrew the democratically elected leader of Iran and installed the Shah as an absolute monarch, with full authorisation from Eisenhower and Churchill. It is an entirely uncontroversial matter of historical record that the British and American government acted to prevent the establishment of democratic rule in Iran, in order to secure supplies of cheap oil.<p>Without providing this context, the piece portrays American diplomats in Iran as hapless victims; In fact, they were active participants in the machinery used to oppress the Iranian people. Most Americans remain completely unaware of the events of the 1953 coup; This makes any mention of the '79 revolution without the context of the '53 coup propaganda, plain and simple. It is the direct moral equivalent of telling people that you were beaten up by some guy, while omitting the fact that you had raped his wife and shot his dog.

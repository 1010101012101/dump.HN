Besides a few high school courses, I have no formal training and program for the web in php with no frameworks (except jquery for javscript/ajax functions).<p>I see a lot of rapid development discussion and I like cranking out relatively simple websites quickly, but I think I am limited by the programming techniques I am using.  For example, I programmed (isWearing.com and SmarterFootball.com), and I used a lot of the similar features into a prototype I made this past week (foodmarkit.com).  All three sites are relatively uncomplicated (mostly database driven), but it took a long time to recreate the same basic processes.  I'm assuming ""there's gotta be a better way"".

The pay wall comes when you want all of that content to go live and be available to your users.<p>Example Concerns:\n1. An account holder can upload unlimited content, but the common use case will only be what they have (on the order of 100MB most).\n2. A user could feasibly switch their billing plan unlimited number of times.\n3. The RESTful interface to the content requires no authentication and isn't throttled (it does do some header checking) and links to large media files are raw, source of request is unchecked on server end.\n4. DDOS, general ""script kiddie"" stuff, dictionary attacks on root pw to servers (i use a non-standard port)<p>Everything that can be considered ""harmful"" would eventually be caught (woe be to my bandwidth bill) and dealt with, but possibly not before some ""damage"" has been done - namely a huge distraction and time sink to find and correct the issue/perpetrator.<p>How much ""abuse"" does your web app take?\nHow aggressive are you in preventing such behaviors?",1277009689

Semantically speaking, parametrized modules are NOT classes/objects.

1445895,comment,1445500,1445500,0,0,city41,,,"I am the developer in this situation right now. I was hired by a small company as their sole developer to write them a program. So far, I have to say I pretty much disagree with everything said here.<p>I think the developer really needs to know the details of the domain and problem space. The company I am working for is a workforce management consulting firm. The first week on the job I interviewed 10+ consultants with the company. Got to know their tasks, goals, accomplishments, needs and pain points. I also shadowed in on one consultant for a day, and read a lot of literature. I know an awful lot now what it means to do work force management and workforce management consulting. This is helpful, very helpful. I become a knowledgeable user of the very system I am creating. Imagine if Adobe's developers had no clue about image editing, Photoshop would have been a disaster.<p>This feeds into my other point. Don't give the developer detailed descriptions of every click, button, error, etc. Give them the exact opposite. Tell them what the system needs to accomplish, and let them design it. For one, they will almost certainly design a simpler and easier to manage system than you will (maybe not easier to user, because let's face it, that's not usually a programmer's forte). Since the developer now knows the domain pretty well, they can use that knowledge to help design an effective solution. let the developer arrive at your goal with as minimal amount of code and work as possible. That way you can see your vision in the flesh, use it, and actually start to understand what it does. Only once a feature is actually implemented and put to use do you really start to understand what it needs to do.<p>Maintain a dialog with your developer. Give feedback often and have the two of you work together on where the project is going.<p>Basically all I am saying boils down to what most agile development processes ascribe to.<p>I do however totally agree with doing the ""simple"" version 1.0 release first.",1277009267

Not sure why that didn't contribute anything, but that's what most rational adults do in that situation. It certainly wasn't part of the thread until then.""<p>I'm consistently amused at how people who get their comments downvoted complain about the downvoting by rephrasing the point they were trying to make in order to make it clearer and more articulate. I do it, too. The joke is that if the original post expressed your point as clearly as the complaint post, we wouldn't get downvoted in the first place.<p>Writing for human consumption is a frustrating and inexact task. You might sound like a complete asshole without meaning to. I, in particular, often have that problem.",1277006962

He designed all his inventions in his head, then drafted and assembled them (they all worked the 1st time). He was so unaggressive in attacking other people financially he got screwed over. It is unlikely you have used a direct invention (not a derivative/improvement) of Bell's nor Edison's but I can be certain you are typing on a computer that uses an AC power supply or charger and thus know you have use one of Tesla's.",1277006739

She probably only used it because 'bank' is one of the first things that came to her mind when thinking of 'responsible adult stuff'. The examples she gave were exaggeratedly simplistic for <i>comedic effect</i>: email, go to the bank, and clean stuff. It's funny. It's like a metaphor for 'stuff that adults do', alright?",1277006643

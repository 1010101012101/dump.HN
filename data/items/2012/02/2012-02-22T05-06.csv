Their critical product is their battery technology.  It is second to none, in a business where the battery is everything.  This is <i>the reason</i> that both Daimler and Toyota have invested in the company.  I think you are seriously underestimating how important this is.<p>As to the article proper: it seems to me that running down your car is a pretty simple problem to engineer away.

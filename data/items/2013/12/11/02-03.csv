And in many, if not most cases, that&#x27;s iOS.<p>It seems that what you are asking is whether the school should take steps to ensure that kids can develop mobile applications. If that is the case then the school could just set up a single app store account as part of a mobile development course. If the school really wants people to develop mobile applications then the $99 fee is meaningless.  I doubt that there is any overwhelming demand to do that on the part of students or teachers.<p>Of course, any kid can develop a whole plethora of applications for a variety of platforms at very low cost if they really want too. Considering that it wasn&#x27;t too long ago that it took thousands of dollars to even get a computer(and many people I know didn&#x27;t grow up having access to a computer of their own) your criticism is essentially looking a gift horse in the mouth.

Hitler didn&#x27;t seize power because the SA had some intricate intelligence apparatus. Nor was it the case for the the fascists in Italy, nor Spain. I would argue it was for them simply a tool for the consolidation of power and their fight against subversion.<p>Just like - in la-la land - if the US government were to turn evil, they would use surveillance to oppress the people. But at that point it&#x27;s &quot;too-late&quot;. The oppression comes first, and then the surveillance to back it up.<p>&quot;I think it&#x27;s rather more that the history of states turning fascist...&quot;<p>I think maybe the larger issues is that the &quot;cyclicality&quot; of history is really more about people seeing patterns where there are none (and historians justifying their jobs). Virtually all the examples we return too are from the beginning of the 20th century. Somehow because of how horrible WW2 was we feel that this may happen again if we aren&#x27;t careful.<p>But in reality, history doesn&#x27;t really &quot;repeat itself&quot; as the old says goes. The NAZI arose during a period of extreme nationalism. There is no reason to believe that this will <i>necessarily</i> happen again. For instance it didn&#x27;t happen before the end of the 19th century since nationalism is a relatively new concept. And we don&#x27;t for examples anticipate the return of communism, or disco.<p>I think at this point in our cultural evolution a return to tyranny is simply impossible. We have so much precedent of the success of democracy and our thinking on human rights has evolved to a point where this is simply unsustainable<p>to close with some data:<p><a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/2013/02/13/5-ways-china-could-become-..\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thediplomat.com/2013/02/13/5-ways-china-could-become-...</a>.<p>&quot;Statistical analysis shows that authoritarian regimes become progressively more unstable (and democratic transitions more likely) once income rises above $1,000 (PPP) per capita. When per capita income goes above $4,000 (PPP), the likelihood of democratic transitions increases more dramatically. Few authoritarian regimes, unless they rule in oil-producing countries, can survive once per capita income hits more than $6,000 (PPP).&quot;",1386728640

It really is a surprisingly complicated topic, I have my doubts about some aspects too.<p>I was never much fond of killing animals for food, but what ultimately compelled me to go vegetarian was an article similar to this[0] I have read many years ago.  I always “knew” this is what&#x27;s happening in the animal derived food industry, but somehow reading that with all the depictions stuck some cord in the emotional and moral part of my mind and I decided to simply stop eating meat from that moment on.  It was remarkably easy for me once I had that moment of “illumination” (for a lack of a better word), I&#x27;ve never had any desire to try meat since then (although I&#x27;ve tried one small piece of meat several years ago just to see what will happen--nothing, complete indifference).  But, I haven&#x27;t gone further, I haven&#x27;t even tried being vegan.  Although I understand the vegan argument, and agree with it in principle on an intellectual level, but that emotional part of the experience leading to moral commitment, that spark is missing (there&#x27;s also the practicality angle, I live in a culture that&#x27;s not really conductive to being vegetarian, let alone vegan, eating out can be a bit complicated sometimes).<p>So there, I just wanted to share my experience of learning (and I still am).  I understand what you&#x27;re saying when it comes to changing perspectives.<p>[0] In a magnificent anarchist magazine, The Match, self printed (non digital, on a Linotype machine IIRC) and published by Fred Woodworth[1], a great anarchist and an amazing individual in general.

This is the intrinsic downside of allowing diplomatic cooperation to extend beyond its traditional domain of war and peace.[1] In liberal democracies, the organs of foreign policy are designed to be opaque and non-responsive to the public. In the United States, this is by design--stemming from the framers&#x27; worry that a democracy wouldn&#x27;t be able to speak with the required single voice when it came to issues of foreign policy. But the flexibility of the process militates towards keeping it restricted to a narrow domain.<p>[1] There is something fundamentally undemocratic about using the diplomatic process to normalize law between countries. Yes it makes business easier, but it undermines democratic control over law. The law of a country should be an expression of the will of its voters, and <i>only</i> its voters.

One function that I love from Sketch is that you can copy/paste styles, which makes the library use more flexible. You can copy CSS, but I wish that you could also past CSS into an object since we also have an ongoing UI library written in LESS",1386727400

I was expecting some real life horror story of a false positive or deliberate framing, but instead I was given examples of how this data could be used constructively to try and evaluate where there might be a high likelihood of crime occurring, and trying to prevent it.

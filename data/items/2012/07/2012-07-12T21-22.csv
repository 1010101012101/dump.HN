It may not have been bundled up in CDOs, but look what happened to Countrywide - they went under (or, I guess, technically force onto BofA by the government) because they held on to their own paper.  Even still the bulk of the writedowns have yet to occur, and the taxpayers will end up picking up the tab for all that garbage the GSEs hoovered up.<p>>Also it's not political, my dyed in the wool republican finance teacher/boss spoke about how glass steagal was grudgingly useful, before the crisis hit. It isn't a theory propagated during the crisis, it's a theory substantiated by the crisis.<p>He has no way of knowing that.  The problem with economics is it isn't in any way a science.  For nearly every position you can take on an issue you'll find respected economists on both sides looking at the same data and drawing different conclusions.<p>I'm not saying there's no logic in that position, just that the idea the whole problem was Glass-Steagal is only getting a lot of play in the media because it dovetails nicely with ""those ebil greedy banksters"" talking points on the left.",1342130262
4237082,comment,4234768,4235927,1,0,martininmelb,,,"I used to use IntelliJ when I programmed in Java and loved it. I was still learning Java and its ability to show help, check syntax and refactor was excellent.  But then I did less Java and more Python and returned to vim.  One issue was that I was not only editing code, I was writing documents in LaTex, I was editing large 'data' files (ascii text), I was editing blogs and other notes in Markdown etc.  Unfortunately, IntelliJ seems to regard everything as a project and does not make it easy (at least back then) to simply create or edit a file that is not part of a particular project.<p>Another advantage of vim is that most of the time at work I am working on a PC but editing files on Linux boxes.  At home I am on a mac. I know I could run X, but I prefer running Putty, and I enjoy the lightweight nature of just bringing up vim.  So, currently, vim is my editor of choice.<p>Also, I must admit that after 20+ years of using vi/vim, I still make the occasional mode mistake and type 'i' when in insert mode, or ':wq', but vim is still my favourite editor.",1342130254

4237071,comment,4236429,4236879,31,0,commieneko,,,"Older industries often had specialty units for measurement.  The Point unit was designed during the early days of printing, so the system is several hundred years old. It was by no means the only system, but it is the one that seems to have taken over the industry by the 20th century.<p>A point being about 1/72 of an inch or around .35 millimeters.<p>The usefulness of a specialty unit, particularly in a pre-digital, largely human labor intensive world is that you can tailor the unit so that the common sizes are easy to remember and subdivide usefully without having to a lot of math involving fractions or decimals.<p>Most commonly used type sizes are around 12 points, or one pica (1 pica = 12 points)  12 is a good number because there are several whole number factors of it; 1,2,3,4, and 6.  Most common font sizes are even numbers. And the most common  font sizes used are going to be gotten by adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing these numbers.  Thus in mechanical type you would often see fonts at 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 28, 36, 48, 64, and so on. I'm not saying you never saw sizes other than these, but they were comparatively rare. Remember each font size of a typeface had to have the letter forms cut, molds made, type cast, stored and maintained.  A big shop might have a larger collection, a smaller shop would get by with fewer sizes.<p>These days it's certainly no big deal to specify a 17.3 pt font sizes.  At one time, when digital type still relied more heavily on hand tuned pixel based versions for screen display, the above numbers were useful because you could have algorithms for regular pixel thinning since the numbers all factored more easily; but even these used to require a lot of hand running.<p>And even now it' useful for humans to deal with a few, easily distinguished font sizes, at least conceptually.  It's easy to remember what an 18 pt font size might look like vs., say a 24 pt character. And simply using whole number millimeters is a bit course right around the range of most common variation, say 6 - 24.<p>The thing is that with computers it shouldn't really matter <i>what</i> unit you use, assuming you have enough resolution and appropriate anti-aliasing. But the unit <i>should</i> be an absolute measurement, not something based on an undefined pixel size.<p>For a while there was a sort of standard. In the early days of the Macintosh, Apple declared that one screen pixel was one point, and we would pretend that for practical purposes that was 1/72 of an inch. And it was pretty close, at least if you were only using a word processor. Designers <i>did</i> have to worry about the difference and understood that the image on the screen was not <i>exactly</i> the same size. And there were wrinkles and variations in how the various font rendering technologies dealt with the issue.<p>The simplest solution would be to simply require the OS to know the actual size and aspect ratio of the pixels on your screen.  But getting everyone to rewrite the software to be pixel agnostic is going to be the rub.<p>For UI uses, points would seem to be not terribly useful.  Many elements would be large numbers, so the advantages over, say centimeters is going in the wrong direction. And you are going to be seeing much more variation in sizes for UI elements than you are going to be seeing in typography.  You have little bitty UI elements and you have UI elements that easily take up half the page or screen.  Normal metric measurements would seem the most appropriate.<p>And in fact, in typography and page layout you see other units other than points to describe things. There's the aforementioned Pica, which is often used to describe things like column and page widths. And of course, these days, plain old inches and centimeters are used for laying out pages <i>all the time.</i><p>Edit: Pixels do still factor heavily into measurement on video displays, as opposed to computer displays. A video display is ""stupid"" in the sense that it is a known number of pixels, but the size of them is assumed to vary quite a bit; from a couple of inches to tens of meters. Of course these screens aren't conceived of as an up-close medium.  You look at them from at ranges from across the living room to across the football stadium.<p>In video it is quite common for measurements to be expressed in percentages of the screen rather than pixels or absolute measurements. You have concepts like ""lower thirds"" for supplementary text and images, or 20% safe areas around the edges of the screen. You can put things in the center of the field or use the old standby ""rule of threes"" from photography composition.  Confusingly and irritatingly type <i>is</i> typically specified in pixels. And yes, this does cause problems when designing imagery for use on different devices like real time character generators and special compositing hardware.  These days you simply make the assumption that you are designing for one particular format, say 720p, specify in pixels for that, and then ""do the math"" when targeting the graphics for use at other formats.",1342130011

4237047,comment,4234912,4234912,0,0,grellas,,,"This piece amounts to a red alert signal from a distinguished judge to Congress that it needs to fix some pernicious elements of the U.S. patent system and that it needs to do so <i>now</i>. The tone is judicious but the message is essentially alarmist: the system is seriously out of whack and Congress needs to get on with fixing it.<p>Judge Posner admits he is no expert on what the fixes should be and his tentative suggestions for fixing the system are, in my view, decidedly mixed on their merits (e.g., specialized adjudications before the USPTO - remember when it was suggested that a specialized appeals court would improve the patent system and the result was a court that has been so maximalist in its approach to patents that it has in itself become a significant part of the problem).<p>So where to begin?<p>Legally, it has to go back to fundamentals and, for me, this has to go back to the scope of patentable subject matter and whether this should be defined to include software at all.<p>The Patent (and Copyright) Clause of the Constitution (Article I, sec. 8, cl. 8) provides that the Congress shall have the power ""to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."" Note that, in defining this as one of the enumerated powers of the federal legislative branch, the Constitution does not mandate that the legislature provide for patent protection of any sort. It merely permits the exercise of such a power within constitutionally prescribed limits. Thus, any legitimate exercise of patent authority in the U.S. must come from Congress and must respect the constitutional bounds that any grant of patents be for ""limited times"" and be done in such a way as ""to promote the progress of science and useful arts."" Legally, then, any patent system in the U.S., if adopted at all, must be authorized and defined by Congress with a view to promoting the progress of science and, implicitly, must employ ""limited times"" consistent with what it takes to promote scientific progress.<p>The first issue, then, is whether patents are needed at all to promote the progress of science. In the U.S., in spite of philosophical arguments to the contrary by Jefferson (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1171754"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1171754</a>), this has never been seriously in dispute. The industrial revolution was already well in progress in 1789, when the Constitution was adopted, and the federal authority, though generally regarded with great wariness at the time, was seen as vital to protect the rights of inventors and to reward them with limited monopoly grants in order to encourage the progress of science. In the first U.S. Patent Act (Act of April 10, 1790, 1 Stat. 109, 110), Congress implemented its constitutional authority to sanction patent monopolies by defining patentable subject matter very broadly, to include ""any useful art, manufacture, engine, machine, or device, or any improvement therein."" Congress amended the Act in 1793 and then again in 1952, so that today it reads as to the idea of ""patentable subject matter"" as follows (35 U.S.C. sec. 101): ""Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.""<p>Thus, patents in the U.S. can be granted for any original invention that fits within the definition of patentable subject matter and that also meets the other conditions of the patent act (i.e., that is useful and non-obvious). Note, though, that the 1952 definition of patentable subject matter significantly <i>expanded</i> the scope of such subject matter in the name of bringing the patent laws up to date with developments in then-modern technology, all in the name of promoting the progress of science. It did so by defining patentable subject matter to include any ""new and useful process"" as well as any ""new and useful improvement"" of any original invention. Over time, ""process"" has come to embrace business methods and also software. And the protection of ""useful improvements"" made clear that new <i>uses</i> of existing machines or processes could be patented notwithstanding older Supreme Court decisions such as <i>Roberts v. Ryer</i>, 91 U.S. 150, 157 (1875) (""it is no new invention to use an old machine for a new purpose"").<p>To promote the progress of science, then, Congress in 1952 allowed patents to be granted for any inventive process and for any inventive new use for any such process. In my view, this generally made sense for what was essentially the continued playing out of the same sort of industrial revolution that animated the original forms of patent protection granted in 1790. Looking at that language at that time, one could readily make the case that patentable processes and improvements thereon could and did promote the progress of science. Discrete inventions tended to be sharply differentiated and tended to involve significant development effort in time and resources. An inventor could keep a process secret and not patent it but the grant of a limited monopoly gave a decided inducement to disclose it to the world and, hence, to expand the broad pool of scientific know-how available to society.<p>Then came the digital revolution and, with software, a new or improved process can amount to an almost trivial variation on prior art amidst a seemingly endless stream of improvements developed in ever-rapid succession and with little or no capital investment beyond what developers would be motivated to do for reasons entirely independent of gaining monopoly protection for the fruits of their efforts. Moreover, there is little that is closed about such innovations: a wide knowledge base is in place, known to an international developer community that is basically scratching its collective head asking why it should be restricted legally from using techniques and processes that represent common knowledge in the field.<p>The main question, then, concerning software patents, is whether the existing framework makes sense as one that promotes the ""progress of science"" insofar as it grants patent protection to process inventions in this area. Congress needs to seriously ask itself that question. A second question, also tied to constitutional authority and assuming that it is legitimate to grant <i>some</i> form of patent for such inventions, is whether a 20-year period of exclusivity makes sense in an area where innovation occurs at blazing speeds and with not too much capital investment tied specifically to any given discrete invention. Is that necessary to promote the progress of science? That too is a question that Congress needs to consider.<p>Thus: (1) there is nothing magical about the current definition of patentable subject matter and Congress can adapt this to suit the needs of the time in promoting the progress of science, (2) process patents are in themselves a fairly recent phenomenon (at least in any large numbers) and it is no radical change to curtail them in areas where they make little or no sense in light of the constitutional purpose for why patents even exist in the first place, and (3) legitimate patent reform needs to go far beyond procedural fixes around the edges of the system and needs to focus on the realities of modern technology and whether the patent laws further or impede the progress of science as applied.<p>The policy debate can and will go all over the board on this but, if it is framed in light of the constitutional foundation for having patents in the first place, it can be shaped in a way that puts the focus on the fundamentals of what needs to be fixed as opposed to lesser issues that do not get to the heart of the problem. The main problem today is the blizzard of vague and often useless patents in the area of software. These are effectively choking all sorts of innovation and are benefiting mainly lawyers, trolls, and others who do not further technological development by what they do. It is a mistake, in my view, then, to swing too broadly in trying to fix things (as by advocating abolition of all patents) or to be so timid about the issues that reform is marginal at best and ineffective in dealing with the current crisis of an over-abundance of essentially worthless patents. Congress <i>embraces</i> the patent system as a whole and shows no hostility to its fundamentals. Reform must be shaped in light of those fundamentals but it must, at the same time, be meaningful to eliminate the main garbage from the current flawed system.

4237007,comment,4235893,4235893,4,0,cdata,,,"Hello Saurik, I'm the author of much of the code related to the problem you were experiencing on CloudFlare. We met a while ago at Velocity. I'm a huge fan of your work on Cydia, I really enjoyed reading your write-up, and I admire the penetrating approach you took to debugging this particular issue. Your diagnosis is accurate, and we are preparing a solution for the problem even as I write this.<p>There are a few points that I would like to respond to:<p><i>While [preloader] maybe a nifty feature in some contexts, in the case of ModMyi the list of files seems to be a bunch of content for ModMyi's main website... the result being that millions of users of Cydia are wasting bandwidth and limited cache space downloading a number of files from ModMyi that are both a) large (as they are designed for desktop browsers) and b) useless.</i><p>I'm afraid that this is a case of a one-size-fits-all solution not fitting anyone perfectly. Our current preloader implementation is most effective on medium-small-scale sites, and many medium- to large-scale sites experience the same problem you describe. We are working to update the feature to be ""more intelligent"" about what assets it loads, and where. Currently the list of pre-load-able assets is a global one, but we hope to make it a list that is consumed on a per-page basis, where the assets loaded are relevant to pages most-often visited from whatever the current page is.<p><i>While you can also get around this using standard HTML5 messages, these would affect the normal operation of the website CloudFlare is serving (something CloudFlare should be going to lengths to avoid).</i><p>This is an aside, but I should point out that some of our features (many of which were requested by customers) include some that create significant, intentional side-effects. Our image lazy loading feature, for instance, has layout implications. Many of our partner applications embed widgets and manipulate the page in other ways.<p><i>However, as we can see here, CloudFlare is making dynamic code changes to websites, and is using new features such as HTML5 message channels and local storage: features that might not even be implemented correctly in the browser, and which you may be actively avoiding for your own website due to the results of your testing process.</i><p>The surface area for failure related to the features that we work on and deploy is tremendous, particularly in the arena of document manipulation. One bad code push, and suddenly hundreds of thousands of websites could quite literally stop functioning, even if you can still technically get to them.<p>It is certainly true that many of our users are not comfortable with this idea, and those users often disable most of our ""smart"" optimizations. At the end of the day, CloudFlare will always strive to be a great CDN, and we do not require any ""smart"" optimizations to be enabled in exchange for usage of our service.<p>If I may offer another perspective on the topic, one of the things that I love about working at CloudFlare is that we are actively exploring many areas of web optimization that have previously been avoided because they were considered harmful, invasive, and/or overly-ambitious. And to be completely frank, many of the features we are exploring ARE negative in one or more of those ways. However, that doesn't stop us from trying to come up with ways to make the features in question work on arbitrary websites across arbitrary devices and network connections. We aspire to break away from the pre-conceived notions of what a CDN can be, and we have found that our users appreciate us more for taking that approach. As someone who is well known for poking around outside the boundaries of conventional hackery, I hope you can appreciate how sometimes things can break in the process :) I don't personally think it means we should stop trying (nor do I think it precludes us implementing processes to avoid breakage wherever possible).",1342129117

True, in certain tablets and phones, the OS and the hardware are bound together (iPads, etc), but not so on the desktop where screens have different DPI (as evidenced by the OP's photos of his screen setup).<p>This issue is pretty subtle - there's lots of places where ems are the better way to specify point size, like print-centric expereices.<p>Other experiences, like 10' UI on set top boxes, I could argue that pixels are as good as anything given (a) the huge range of screen sizes and distances-to-screen the interface will find itself in, and (b) pixels are, for all practical purposes, the same as expressing things in percentages (HD being a fixed size), but easier for designers to reason about.<p>And finally: 12 point on the screen might be some other type size when moving to mobile (probably smaller) and should almost certainly be using different layout techniques when moving to mobile. Line length, inter-line spacing and distance to screen are all in play here, so don't get suckered into the idea that you can spec the text once and expect scaling on the platform to automagically adjust it everywhere.<p>Related:  responsive layout.  Spec'ing a type size is really only useful within a known domain range.   You should think through the design as you move from platform to platform.<p>Quite the mess. There's no Grand Unified Theory for this stuff yet.  Not sure it even makes sense to go find one.  Great design isn't a matter of being uniform, but through being right-for-the-purpose.<p>That said, the OP is dead on.  IF you're in a place where specifying points is the right thing to do, then a point should be a point, not a pixel.",1342128846

Bugs, missing features, etc.<p>IMO, the larger problem was one of philosophy. Was the site primarily designed for people generating the traffic or those receiving it? How do you deal with people gaming the system? Digg chose to side with the people gaming the system, presumably because it was a more obvious path to profitability. (Digg had a large staff and ridiculously high burn rate) Prior to the v4 redesign, however, there was at least the illusion that regular users' submissions and voting mattered. Digg v4 simply eliminated the roundabout of gaming the system by making votes almost irrelevant; publishers and marketeers could simply pipe all of their content directly to the top of the frontpage by gathering a sufficiently large number of followers. It made the site little more than a pseudo-RSS frontend for content farms.<p>Reddit has been successful by fighting a vigorous, if behind-the-scenes, war against spamming and gaming. It may be regressing toward the mean, but at least it's a mean defined by the users rather than a spammer.",1342128842

It'll make them be more careful, and you needn't use securly to block Facebook's photo upload feature.

If ads are not part of the program, then ad <i>time</i> is not part of program <i>time</i>.  Your statement still fails to clarify that ad time is <i>exclusive</i> of program time.  So long as that is lacking, your statement is misleading and incorrect in English.<p>Second, your original comment (""ads are not programming, but are as long as 50% of the programming"") was correct (to the extent that the 10/30 claim is correct).  My comment was not intended to say that your comment was incorrect, but that it does not change the incorrectness of jrockway's statement.<p>And no, it was not clear what jrockway meant.  My first thought when I read that was ""what the hell?"".  Clearly others were also confused.  Attempting to justify the claim as somehow technically correct at best misguided.  The simple fact is that the statement as he worded it is incorrect and (even with the twisted interpretation) misleading.  As someone else pointed out, having 15 minutes of commercials does not mean that 100% of the program is commercials.  This is a misleading claim, regardless of whether you can produce a convoluted interpretation to support it.<p>If jrockway had simply said ""I spoke poorly"", then I'd have much less of an issue with it.  The fact that he tried to support it by heaping on with ""It's one third of the total, but it's <i>one half when added to the original</i>."" makes me think he either doesn't understand why this is incorrect (non-native speaker?), or he's intentionally pushing a misleading claim.<p>> <i>The formula you just tried to rebut was time a = 10 mins, time b = 20 mins, making a = b </i> .5 --quite sane.*<p>15 minutes = 15 minutes * 1, therefore 100% of the program time is commercial time.  Quite sane.  Or how about:  You have $100 in the bank.  I have $100 in my pocket.  Therefore I have 100% of your money in my pocket.<p>I don't believe that you're actually incapable of seeing the problems with these statements, and how they are incorrect with a standard English interpretation.<p>The fact that you can write a formula that looks correct out of context doesn't make the claim correct.

And I'm pretty sure that to people 50 or 100 years in the future, it will seem barbaric that people in our era waited till they had symptoms to be diagnosed with conditions like heart disease and cancer.<p>For example, in 2004 Bill Clinton found he was feeling short of breath. Doctors discovered that several of his arteries were over 90% blocked and 3 days later he had a quadruple bypass. It seems reasonable to assume Bill Clinton has the best medical care available. And yet even he had to wait till his arteries were over 90% blocked to learn that the number was over 90%. Surely at some point in the future we'll know these numbers the way we now know something like our weight. Ditto for cancer. It will seem preposterous to future generations that we wait till patients have physical symptoms to be diagnosed with cancer.

I work on hiring engineers at a startup, so I can only speak to the kinds of things I look for in an eng resume, and my comments probably don't apply to more creative fields like design (where layout is much more important).<p>For engineering resumes, content trumps layout.  As long as your resume is <i>legible</i> and is in a common format (pdf, doc, txt), it should be fine.  Before I go on to talk about content, here are a few legibility fails I've encountered:<p><pre><code>   - 3+ pages (unless you invented the lightbulb; otherwise STFU)

   - Poor use of endlines.  
</code></pre>
OK, now onto <i>content</i>. You should have the following sections:<p><pre><code>   - Contact info (email, phone, and [GitHub, your website, StackOverflow, etc])

   - Education

   - Jobs

   - Personal projects, if any (NOT CLASS PROJECTS)

   - Skills (optional, see below)
</code></pre>
That's it.  No objective (in 99% of resumes this is bullshit fluff), no summary (see the part about bullshit fluff), no ""references available upon request"".<p>The last thing I'll say about content is that you should try your best to explain what you actually worked on at each of your jobs.  I don't care about how you used Hibernate to accomplish Object Relational Mapping.  That's what Hibernate does.  That's not what you did.  Similarly, please try not to pepper your resume with a bunch of buzzwords.  I know that you my need buzzwords to get past the HR filter, but if so, please list the languages you know and all the frameworks you've used in one ""Skills"" section at the end.  Use common sense when trying to decide how many languages to drop in in a job description -- if you were explaining to your friend what you did, would you mention the language?  If so, include it.  If not, don't.<p>If you found this helpful and have further questions or want me to take a look, please feel free to email me (see my HN user info).",1342128064

2) trade secrets are of no use when embedded as software in devices.<p>Say I come up with a new power control loop for wireless devices. The loop allows radios to cause less interference while maintaining bandwidth. Say I keep it as a trade secret. If I put it in a radio and sell it, someone can reverse-engineer the firmware and copy the design of the power control loop. Trade secrets won't protect me. Moreover, I have to get into the business of building every kind of radio I might want to sell. I can't just sell the power control loop to someone who is good at building radios, because trade secret doesn't cover things you voluntarily disclose. Imagine the situation: I go up to Raytheon and say ""I've got a great power control loop, I'll sell it to you for $50m."" And they say ""well, how does it work? We're not paying $50m without understanding what we're buying.""

It's jarring when you plug a MacBook to a TV, pop in a DVD video, which starts the official DVD Player, and put it in full screen. Possible scenarios include:<p>- you are in mirror mode: this means the TV and the internal display will be at their common denominator, suboptimal in both resolution and aspect ratio.<p>- you are not in mirror mode: the primary display is irrevocably the built-in one. DVD Player goes fullscreen on that 13"", while you can enjoy 42"" of glorious Lion linen. Of course you don't want to close the screen, unless you have both fed the laptop with AC and have an external peripheral at hand to control Apple Remote, an external keyboard or a Magic Trackpad, which is a ludicrous situation.<p>The current solution is of course to use VLC, which goes around Lion's fullscreen API.<p>Yet I see a solution ahead.<p>In Lion an app ""going fullscreen"" really means <i>""the app gets its own space""</i> (I thus prefer the term ""fullspace"" instead). What's more, since Spaces have been introduced, a multihead setup lies in a single, giant Space all across. It follows that since the two screens are one unique Space, an app going fullspace will (under the current implementation) take over the two screens.<p>That's the problem, and so there's the solution: in a dual-head setup, the two screens should be two independent spaces, not one across.<p>This solves a good deal of issues:<p>- fullspace immediately occupies only one screen, with the other ones available to desktops or other fullspace apps<p>- windows can be moved from one monitor to an other monitor <i>from Mission Control</i>. This is not possible currently: you have to exit Mission Control and drag the window to the other screen.<p>- windows can be moved from one monitor to <i>another space on another monitor</i> <i>from Mission Control</i>. This is not possible currently: you have to exit MC, drag the window as the previous case, enter MC again and drag the window to the other space.<p>- and why not, Spaces could be rearranged not only inside each monitor, but <i>across monitors</i>. Take Desktop2 on Screen1, drag it on Screen2 after Desktop3, take fullspaced QuickTime on Screen3, put in on Screen1. There are problems to be solved, like when resolutions differ, but that's really not the end of the world.<p>MC literally begs for those four features.<p>I don't know if Apple thought of it yet (probably) and if they want to go that way (who knows, really). For all I know it would mean a heavy deal of refactoring of the current Spaces implementation (e.g see how currently Desktop1 is never reorderable, how fishy...).",1342127094

Everything they are doing signals a move to simplicity and familiarity with OSX being the system that is 'reigned in and streamlined' in the process.<p>If grey linen and genie animations bum you out, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better, and also, it's not really going to get better.<p>I personally don't mind OSX taking design elements from iOS, hiding powerful features in the name of simplicity (as long as they are still there), animations, linen, etc. As long as the features are still there and the OS is fast, I'm good. Unfortunately, the OS <i>isn't</i> fast. SL-->Lion introduced a sluggishness that is very real and very annoying, though I would probably never notice it if I hadn't upgraded from a much snappier SL.",1342126982

The Vim way is the most simple and effective way to edit text by means of a keyboard. Like Lisp and the Dvorak keyboard, it's alien, but it's actually simpler. Maybe, now that touch-screens are becoming commonplace, an equally or more effective new way will be developed.",1342126943
4236800,comment,4236601,4236695,1,0,BiWinning,,,"There was point, years before the v4 redesign, where 90% of the content hitting the front-page was supplied by 100 or so so-called ""power users"". Of that 90%, probably 40% was supplied by Mr. Baby Man himself. Hitting the frontpage was an impossibility unless you went around friending other users and building up your network. A worthwhile investment if you were doing social media professionally but for the average user they had no voice except in a comments section. After I realized this I moved onto reddit and never looked back. Of course reddit has suffered it's own unique set of consequences from becoming the kid on the block.",1342126936

You can do Ctrl+D to select ""called"" but then what? Extending selection to scope or brackets won't help and you are back to a series of Ctrl+Left -> Ctrl+Left -> Ctrl+Shift+Right -> Ctrl+Shift+Right -> Ctrl+Shift+Right. In Vim, that's ci', or ca' if you want to also remove the quotes. Hell, you don't even have to move the cursor to the quoted text to do that.<p>This scenario happens dozens of times in a given day around here and, as for many other little things, Vim and his ""awkward"" language and it's ""antiquated"" modality rule.<p>The irony, here, is that you actually <i>can</i> change the content of a pair of quotes in ST2.<p>If you activate its Vim mode.",1342126896

They should only exist in the context of word processing and like, where we expect things to be printed in an actual physical size, with 72 points to an inch.<p>For computer interfaces or web documents, we just need some kind of measurement that is a relatively known proportion to the computer or browser's interface. Fortunately, CSS ""px"" does that rather well -- it doesn't indicate physical pixels, but rather logical pixels, and we all know what ""16px"" text looks like relative to our OS, and it works great. And happily, people rarely use ""pt"" in CSS, and in my opinion it should never have been an option in the first place.",1342126890

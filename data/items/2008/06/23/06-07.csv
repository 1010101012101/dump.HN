224858,comment,224615,224682,0,0,skmurphy,,,"These are great suggestions! We use a private wiki that anyone on the team can edit: it saves a lot of time versus E-mail. We use the same page for both the agenda, the minutes, and a decision record (you can always re-factor or start pages to address ongoing issues/concerns, but there should be a single page for the meeting that links to related content). Since you are geographically separated I would use an IM session (e.g skype chat, google chat, AOL, Yahoo) that lets everyone take contemporaneous notes and pass links/URLs and raise their hand to speak. Take a few minutes after the meeting is over to clean up the transcript and paste it into the meeting wiki page, it doesn't have to be pretty, but comprehensible a few months from now (and everyone else can continue to refine/edit etc..). Key thing is to get decisions documented, the context that led to them, and for major decisions a brief prediction on expected outcomes and when and how to re-evaluate.",1214203684

Its way better to actually read a good book, think a great deal and read/write code when appropriate. Computer science is not history where you learn just by reading.

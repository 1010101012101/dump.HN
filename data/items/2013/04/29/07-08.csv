This makes setting up your own start-up (or lifestyle business) a lot simpler.<p>My advice for any developer who wants to do their own start-up is - once you have reached a good standard - to forget honing your development skills and start learning to design.<p>Learning another programming language or mastering another object orientated design pattern does not bring you much closer to being able create a product yourself.

Can voting work if everyone is fully known by the state? If the people in office known where the oppositions voters are, new actions become available. If you can redirect road work, sporting events, sales, and so on, how much work would it really be to get the oppositions voters to spend the day doing something other then voting on the election day? Knowing who votes for who allows those already in power an unfair and destructive advantage over those not yet elected.<p>Take politics in general if we have no privacy. What happens to politics if every to-be political rival is known to those threatened? If we can identify which kids are going to be political active, those could be discourage. Alternative, they could be influenced, drag into the party line before reaching a independent view.<p>Or lets leave politics and go to justice. Can you have a working judge and jury system if everything about their life can be fully known? If one party know that a jury members spouse is cheating, they can rephrase their statements in form of betraying. If someone know about economical troubles, one can redress statements as being ""down on the luck"". If the judge dreams about leaving the bench and begin some childhood dream project, one could phrase statements in favor of startups.

But there are plenty of Alcoholics today who do these same things for LEGAL alcohol.<p>The real problem though lies in what would happen if illicit drugs were accepted and available in society. Drugs are bad. What good comes of them for normal healthy people? How will they improve society? By letting people forget about their problems for a while rather than deal with them?

In other classes, it is mostly a work of memorizing vocabulary or formulas. Very little goes towards thinking, at least in the early stages of education. This trend is encouraged by their third character set, of which you are required to know about 2000 ideograms before graduating high-school.<p>That being said, realize that all these traits have advantages too, sometimes more so than in the western world, sometimes less.<p>EDIT: Oh, and a another important thing I would like to add. Public shaming is used quite effectively because of these traits. Grades are for example hung out in the hall, in a leader-board kind-of fashion.",1367221207

You need to go 'deep' (specialist), rather than 'wide' (mass-market) when it comes to the tools you yourself use.  (Even though what you're creating is probably itself wide.)<p>That's why Microsoft doesn't use it's own source control solution (SourceSafe) internally.  It just doesn't cut it.<p>That's why Apple doesn't design the next iPad on an iPad.<p>That's why McDonald's executes don't hold their business meetings in a McDonald's, to close important international deals etc.<p>You just can't afford to.  This guy says ""At BugHerd, we build a project management tool for web projects. BugHerd is, itself, a web project.""<p>Imagine you just wrote the first version, and you realize that it sucks.  How will you track the transition to the second, non-sucky version?  If you're using project management software - the one you've just written - that by your own admission sucks?<p>That is a formula for disaster.<p>But the very same argument (for not using a disastrous tool) applies for the continual marginal improvement that better tools can give you.<p>It makes ZERO sense to 'bootstrap' any tool using that tool except for some special exceptions.<p>That doesn't mean you shouldn't test it :)<p>--------<p>Some exceptions:<p>1) The tool is the only one that exists. Even a buggy version that takes 10x longer to produce a halfway decent result would still be the only thing that exists.<p>Perhaps the first compiler was like this: i.e. the first time someone translated paper into a compiler, it made sense to use that buggy version to recompile itself with optimizations. But that's because it was the only one to exist.<p>2) if you are now the best on the market, period. So, if you so happened to create the best tool on the market, sure, go ahead and use it.<p>3) if you are on par with the best. This is tricky. You can learn a lot from the competition. It hink in this case you should use both. Gimp might be 'on par' wtih photoshop, but I really think that Gimp developers should use both on a daily basis.

Enterprise deals in this space will have 6 or 7 zeros, so yes, there is a market for generating PDFs. There are already some cloud providers out there (like exari - it's been a while but I remember their stuff being pretty cool.)<p>That's a bit different from vanilla PDF generation, but perhaps a good portion of that is down to marketing. How you position this could be important. You've got your salesforce version - nice :-) That should mean you're selling direct to a business user, so have you worked out what their pain point is? Do they think of it as ""generating PDFs"" (you've branded it as ""Great Reports"", so obviously you think they don't!) I don't know anything about report generation on SF, but I'd be shocked if there wasn't already some competition - have you looked in to that? What's your point of difference?<p>Down to your assumptions:\n1) I've only ever used FOP & yes it is tedious, but it gives you a lot of power, and that power is going to be hard to replicate.<p>2) Generating large no of PDFs is hard to scale. For a cloud service, though, you need to work out how you're going to deliver a large number of PDFs over the wire. (You'll easily be able to generate more bytes of PDF per $ of CPU than you'll be able to transfer per $ of bandwidth.)<p>3) That sounds like a safe assumption (almost a tautology).<p>4) I'm not so sold on this. If I can get equivalent functionality from a library, I'll use the library. I don't want to add a dependency on an external service (making my own service more fragile) unless it offers a significant benefit. Stripe saves me SO MUCH TROUBLE it's a no brainer. There's is no way I would even think of trying to replicate what they've got. The barriers are significant. What are the barriers to me using a library instead of Pagify?

Maybe a very sharp probe, meaning it has a very high electric field intensity at its tip?  The probe could be shifted x-y using piezo actuators.  If the ion source has a very small physical extent, there would be essentially a ""single""[1] electric field line running from the ion source, though the target, to the under-target probe.  (Does Si allow E field lines though like this?)  The emitted ion would follow the electric field line, crashing into the Si target before reaching the sharp probe.  Moving the probe would scan the electric field line, and the point of impact across the surface of the wafer.  Alternatively, keep the ion source and probe stationary and move the wafer x-y.<p>[1] small meaning that the spread of the field lines is less than the desired feature size.",1367219900

It people were allowed to cool down for 12 hours somehow, right before they comitted a murder, the murder rate would drop by 80%. All drug dealing is pre-meditated. You are not comparing similar things.<p><i>>A problem mentality indeed. The claim that a drug dealer ""causes"" overdose is just as ridiculous as the claim that a car salesman ""causes"" car crashes.</i><p>Selling safety approved cars is not illegal. Cars (unlike street drugs) are actually meant to help society. Your logic is sadly misplaced. if I you build a car from scrap metal in your garage and sell it to someone that dies in it because the brakes fail though, you'd better believe you are going to prison (as you should). This is a better example of reality than your attempt at misdirection.<p><i>>Correlation does not imply causation.</i><p>Correlation? we are talking about 15 countries with billions of people here. Sorry, there is no bigger ""study"" that could ever be done. In Singapore or other Asian countries, this fellow would have been executed - no question about it.<p><i>>I cannot see where logic plays into any part of this argument. He knew he was dealing drugs and therefore should be punished exactly X amount? Being complicit in a crime is certainly more damning than being an unknowingly participant, but no part of your analysis uses ""sound and proven logic"" to derive a 25 year prison penalty.</i><p>It is every citizen's responsibility to know the law. Sentencing is publicly available information. He could have found out with a single phone call exactly what penalty he would be looking at. What I am saying is, he is no victim. He chose to convince himself that he would never be caught. The heavier the punishment, the harder it is to convince yourself that it is worth the risk. Asian countries have proven this quite sufficiently. The problem is that our wussified system deems harsh punishment to be ""mean"" and so enables far more people to suffer in the long run.<p>If anyone here is married and is raising children, they know exactly how this wussification has penetrated into the fiber of our society so deeply. It is from women gaining power and influence. Women will not punish kids appropriately, they are too emotional and not logical. They allow their emotion to prevent them from seeing the big picture. Punishing your child today is difficult. it requires a lot of effort and requires putting a lot of unhappiness on your kids and yourself, but if you let everything go or don't give a fitting punishment (severity and approach to be 'fitting' varies from child to child), you are enabling your kids to become worse and worse. Eventually they get so rotten than you may decide to put your foot down. It MAY not be too late at this juncture, but one thing is for sure, if you had only taken care of business at a much earlier stage, It would have required less effort and pain for everyone involved.<p>Furthermore, women are the reason for the crippling level of political correctness that exists today. Women have instilled so much of this that the media, politicians and any other person who is in a position of any influence is paralyzed. They cannot place blame for anything out any group without risking a huge backlash.<p>Women are the reason for such high unemployment. 50 years ago, people were told, you don't work - you don't eat. Now we give people unemployment then disability for the rest of their lives (Not to mention that there is less jobs to go around now because women don't stay home to raise their own children).<p>Same with illegal immigration blindness, Social programs spending and waste skyrocketing, over sized government, invading foreign lands to ""help those poor citizens"", Illegal drug tolerance, poor educational system, Day care raises our kids now for crying out loud. No wonder this country is going to hell in a hand basket. Most parents shouldn't even be allowed to have a cat let alone children. Most moms of young kids are at work for 10 hours during the day and watch 1.7 hours of TV at night. What the hell are the kids doing during this time? The worst part is that (western) men are just standing by and letting this thing go. They are being subjugated slowly. Wake up men and lead your family like your ancestors did. You yourself will not be an ancestor if you keep on this way.<p>I fear that the west will eventually will fall because of this. Left will be Asia and Africa.",1367219654

From a REST point of view - the map is the resource. The adddress is well, not really a resource (the logic goes like this: if the address is the resource, the browser as a resource getter should only get the address, not the surrounds). IMHO the address should be modelled as an element of the resource, accessible by Maps' javascript.<p>2. Of course you can have nice URLs without being indicative of RESTfulness. Consider an address in Japan. They do not have road names, instead, they use building/block numbers for naming/addressing. While that can still be modelled as a nice URL, the convention is now flipped, and people will be confused<p>3. Consider that some places do not actually have an address. Like my former residence. Due to changes in the roads, my place had a new road with no name, and no actual address (well, eventually it did, and the road still has no name. Getting pizza delivered was tough)<p>What can be done of course is a bit.ly kind of thing, which I think will work. Something like /maps/199-valencia-street-san-francisco-california-united-states.

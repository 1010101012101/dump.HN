131581,comment,131536,131558,0,0,jey,,,"Why is it good for kids to be motivated by the fact that they're paying a lot of money? People should be in school if they're motivated by their desire to learn, or they should just get out and stop diluting the experience for everyone else.<p>Our society doesn't do a good job of serving kids who just want job training and don't have an academic bent. Right now we lump together the people who want vocational training and a certificate of competency with the people who are passionate and want to learn. This leads to a mixed weird situation where too much irrelevant stuff is ""taught""[1] from the perspective of the vocational students, and the course work is largely busy work from the perspective of those who want to learn.<p>That ""Mathematician's Lament"" that appeared on here recently is a great exposition on this problem. <a href=""http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf</a><p>1.

131565,comment,131359,131359,0,0,mk,,,"Aqua looks nicer than any windows manager has to offer. I run Ubuntu for my work desktop, and Debian for servers, but at home I have a macbook and a mac mini running 10.5. Before that I had a powerbook for 4 years. They are all awesome machines. I didn't have to spend time tweaking config settings to try to get the sound card working, or deal with updating and breaking everything. On OS X I've never had to fix something after an update, and sound always works. I'm not dissing any linux distros, but they are truly for hackers that want to spend time tweaking on things getting them to work and dealing with problems. OS X allows me to get more work done because I'm not dealing with those hassles yet I still have vim/emacs/whatever other unix app I want to install. The only complaint I have is that the packaging doesn't seem to be as good as Debian/FreeBSD/Gentoo. Maybe this has changed in the last couple years, but Macports and fink never really worked out all that well for me.",1204928182

131558,comment,131536,131536,0,0,iamdave,,,"Feel free to take this at face value, but this somewhat concerns me.  I attended community college for one semester before transferring to a state uni where tuition was almost 20,000 dollars more and in my experience the characteristic and personal motivation was much different.  At the community college (where students often did not have to pay tuition at all because of the low cost bundled with state provided financial support) students seemed apathetic about attending class, and personal success whereas the students at the state uni (who faced the prospect of having to pay thousands in student loans) this was the complete opposite.<p>Students had a higher degree of personal commitment, and motivation to succeed at the uni level.  Who knows if this will be the case at MIT, but this is just what I happened to experience when the disparity of income became as overt as it did",1204927736

You never know from the start the route to those leaves because of the complexity of the software. Trying to optimise early is either like taking all possible routes but stopping after a short while on each. \nWhat I'm trying to say is optimisation is always a matter of _depth_, not of breadth.

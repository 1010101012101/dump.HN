90998,comment,90847,90982,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Seriously. Online productivity suites are, what, two years old now? (Writely launched in October 2005.) If good software takes ten years[1], we're 20% of the way there.<p>For god's sake, people, have some patience, and enjoy the bleeding edge while it lasts! In 2020, complaints about the performance of online apps are going to sound as quaint as my complaint about my first hard drive does today. (I paid <i>$400</i> for 80 lousy <i>megabytes</i> in 1990. I can barely even <i>type</i> that, it sounds so unbelieveable now.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html</a>",1198032741

90994,comment,90898,90898,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"Python is more consistent, and it has a limited set of core concepts the language was built around.  Secondly, Python was designed to make it harder for you to write unclear or bad code.  While the code is less forgiving of mistakes than PHP, you can't help but improve on your personal coding practices after using the language for a while.  Finally, Python's library support is better if you want to do anything other than web programming.",1198032469

90988,comment,90782,90806,0,0,donal,,,"There is one thing that PHP has going for it as a first language:\nYou can do ""cool"" things with it almost immediately. It is like making an animated drawing back in the day in [whatever version of] Basic.<p>Most into tutorials start ""this is an int, this is a char, this is a variable, etc."" Before you even get to anything interesting you are already dozing off.<p>With PHP, however, you can hack together your own blog/website show it to your friends and say ""I made this."" The ability to say ""I made this"" is the best feature of any language, but usually it is a pretty inaccessible feature for the beginner.",1198030469

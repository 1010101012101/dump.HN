Later practical work lead to someone seeing use in them (but only the a vague way - limits - which could have been and probably found through experiment as well).<p>The example you gave of your proof doesn't say all that much, you won an argument (you said those algorithms were practically useful anyway).<p>I'm sincerely sorry if I come across as hostile.

There's a huge gap.""  When something is then found that's an intermediate form, they then say: ""See! I told you!  Now you have <i>two</i> gaps, and it's even worse!!""<p>So my point is this.  I've read what you say, and I can see that you earnestly believe that pure mathematics and the theorems it produces are of no use.  I'm asking what it would take to change your mind.  What evidence would you need to convince you?<p>Science is grounded on falsifiable conjectures, and makes progress by testing those conjectures.  If you are unwilling or unable to tell us what would be sufficient evidence, then I am unwilling to start chasing ghosts.  It seems to me that trying to convince you would be like trying to nail fog to a wall.<p>Engineering is a critical discipline, and without it, things wouldn't get made.  However, engineers rely on techniques that are known to work, and often that knowledge is based on deep theoretical work.  Error-correcting codes, via which we get images back from Mars, and which allow reliable communications over cost-effective links are based on theoretical work.  Yes, people played about and found the principles, but then they leveraged work done a century earlier to get to the limits.  Having done so, they explored the theorems to see what axioms they were based on, and worked to see if those axioms could be circumvented.<p>It's the interplay between pure theory and pure experimentation that gives us enormous benefits, but it appears that you are willing, even eager, to dismiss fields of which you have no knowledge, purely because you can't see how they can possibly be useful.<p>It's Blub[0][1], all over again, but here we're not on a linear continuum, we're in a richly interconnected web of dependencies.<p>Another example.  Fourier Transforms were first explored as a purely theoretical construct, showing that functions (with appropriate properties) form a vector space, and that vector space therefore has a basis, and that we should therefore be able to decompose functions into a representation relative to some basis.  For decades this was a novelty, and then people started to use it for real.  The theorems show the limitations, and then the engineers explore what can be physically achieved within those limits.  Wavelets are now often used in contexts where the usual Fourier basis of trigonometric waves prove to be less useful, but the underlying theory is identical, and is still applied.  And we know it will work, because of the theorems that were proven decades ago.  The vector spaces are, by the way, infinite dimensional, and the work to understand the infinities was done as a part of pure math with no obvious applications.<p>Another example.  We know that some problems are equivalent to others, and we know that the current best algorithms for these problems are exponential.  We therefore know, for sure, and not just because of experiments, that some instances of some search spaces will be infeasible without a major break-through.  As a specific example of that, multiple times people have claimed efficient algorithms for problems known to be NP complete.  In some cases I've been able to prove that their algorithms, while possible useful in general, are definitely not polynomial.  I can do that because of the theorems I have to hand.<p>But you won't care, and I can't make you care.  I'm not writing this for you, because you appear not to be willing to change your mind, or consider that a field of which you appear to know very little might just be useful.<p>No, I'm writing this for people who read your comments and wonder.  I'm writing this for people who are willing to entertain the idea that things of which they know little or nothing might be useful in ways they can't yet imagine.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_%28computer_programmer%29#Blub"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_%28computer_program...</a>",1349861209

I guess it's a shallow attempt to engender sympathy, which is odd because I have precisely zero sympathy for either of them.<p>Lots of people (myself included) had been saying that Facebook was overvalued pre-IPO. I don't say this as any testament to any investment acumen I purport to possess (on the contrary, I largely suck at particularly short term share trading). What I do mean is that as an outsider with some cursory research and common sense, this was entirely predictable.<p>The only unknown with the IPO was how irrational the market would be and I'm glad to see it wasn't.<p>The people who say ""look at the eyeballs they have; the sky is the limit"" are the last people you should take investment advice from. Facebook had (and has) two primary sources of revenue: advertising and virtual goods. Valued against similar companies it was overvalued. And still is (IMHO).<p>I think this piece overstates that Facebook was attempting to hide things here. It's natural that any IPO will try to disclose as little as possible and try to be as positive as possible while stil being truthful and accurate.<p>Personally I may think of buying in if its gets down to $10-12.<p>Even so, Facebook is an extremely risky investment. Instagram is a cautionary tale here: from nothing to existential threat that you need to buy-to-shelve for $1 billion in two years... well, I guess it doesn't take much to threaten Facebook.",1349860382

The trouble we constantly ran into was zeromq is really just a fancy socket library - this means that you have to program all the logic yourself if you want certain things to happen if messages cannot be delivered (e.g. log the fact at a minimum), or get queued abnormally long, or get acks from the other side etc. \nWhich is fine - you have to do all this yourself with plain sockets unless you just need a fire & forget system(albeit with the smarts of retrying and failover and some convenience of pub-sub). However we ran into problems where we could not get the info out of zmq that we wanted, such as the fact a peer had failed, the current rtt, and other things - leaving the gain we'd get from zmq at practically nothing.",1349860030

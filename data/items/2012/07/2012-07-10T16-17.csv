During those 10 years we have had many ups and downs. We switched business models 3 times - and each time we did this we cut off all revenue streams and started over. The result was personal financial disaster (when I knew we were going to cut off revenues, I took out as many credit cards as I could so my family and I could live). The good news is that our 3rd pivot actually worked out really well. We are now doing about $1M in revenue and growing pretty fast. I am now making decent money ($8-10k/mo gross)...but not enough to pay back all of my debts (I don't even know where to start). My wife has her check garnished (because of my issues) but I have been able to avoid it.<p>Basically, I decided a long time ago that if the ship went down I was going down with it. I also decided that I would never let that happen...kind of the classic ""you don't lose if you never quit"" mentality. I have worked my arse off for 10 years and persevered through it all. I have been able to compartmentalize my credit problems and drive my company forward.<p>I would like to hear from some people ""in the know"" if my credit issues are going to hurt my chances of getting my company funded. We are ready to take it to the next level and I am afraid that my credit score may be an anchor.",1341939432

I'm asking because on one hand you're asking for a unified communication app, but on the other, the way you wrote that part, it sounds like a bad thing.<p>Taking this specific example, I think it shows that aggregating communication media is difficult and maybe not a good thing. In Messages, SMS and what is pretty much IM is mixed and I don't know which is which anymore.<p>I do find the idea of a unified inbox interesting and worthy of being explored but the thing is that each of these have different expectations from the users. If I send an SMS, it's typically because I expect a response fairly quickly: pretty similar to IM, except that I want to reach the person right now wherever they are. An email has a longer reply timeframe: if I don't hear back for a few days, it's usually fine. A tweet or Facebook status doesn't have the expectation to be read by everyone. (because it's one-to-many)<p>And I think the expectations go both ways: when someone receives an SMS vs. an email, they know the time to reply is different.<p>There are also different expectations in terms of half-life of the content. SMSs are sent and forgotten for the most part, while emails are archived for years.

We pushed 4,000 TPS through servers less powerful than an iPhone.  I also spent time at Akamai, though I admittedly worked on a tiny, isolated test lab (150 servers or so, a fraction of a percent of the ""real"" server base).<p>I have worked with some amazing people, at all scales, and I have never seen a deployment that managed to completely avoid manual logins.  No, you aren't logging into a few hundred hosts manually (well, there was this one shop... but let's not hold that up as exemplary).  But you're probably logging into a few to test things out manually before you decide what your automated deployment script will be rolling out.<p>Even when you do deploy a fix, with a large sysadmin team it's good to know WHO exactly ran that one-off deployment script. When I said ""auditing"", I wasn't even thinking of PCI, or auditing against malicious actions of any kind - just simple troubleshooting forensics.  But we have a great, robust way to see exactly who modified a file and when; it's the file system. Why reinvent it?  (I just spent the last day trying to figure out who edited a script.  Why, ""postgres"" did.. of course it did.)<p>Should you aim to do these manual config changes in the test lab first? Of course. Do you always succeed? No. Some things only get tested in the big lab. Reality intervenes.  I try to plan for it.<p>Mind you, I'm arguing this partly to see if I can be talked out of it.  I <i>think</i> I believe it, but I've been wrong about way bigger things. If you've achieved my automation nirvana, and you roll things out to a few thousand servers, never manually, and never wondering who did it, tell me how it works.",1341938304

It is misinformed.<p>Others on this thread have pointed out that the Alioth benchmark takes startup time into account. Yes, this imposes a startup penalty on Clojure.<p>More importantly, the implementations of each individual benchmark vary significantly in performance quality. High-performance Clojure requires a couple of tricks in type hinting, using unchecked arithmetic, and preferring native Java arrays.<p>I looked at a couple of the benchmarks, and the mandelbrot example uses those tricks. Notice the performance there: <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64/performance.php?test=mandelbrot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64/performance.php?test=m...</a><p>Notice that Java 7 and gcc run at about the same speed, and Clojure is only about 2.2x slower (than C). Scala is about 1.9x slower (than C). gcc is about 1.5x slower than Intel Fortran.<p>To make the benchmark more fair: (1) all timings should disregard startup time; and (2) all JVM languages should have the opportunity to run the benchmark a few thousand times before timing it. Otherwise, it measures JVM startup time, and then it measures how long it takes the JIT to achieve maximum optimization. By comparison, the C and Fortran code runs at full speed almost out of the gate.<p>All-in-all, considering that Clojure is an extremely high-level language I consider its performance impressive [1]. Yes, the inner loops need to be coded in a slightly un-idiomatic manner, but you can do all this in the comfort of your REPL, which makes the process of making optimizations reasonably painless.<p>[1] Don't forget to scroll down the mandelbrot results and look at the stellar performance of other popular high-level languages.",1341938135

The ratio would imply a months salary would be sufficient FU money if you could invest it at even 1%.<p>A slightly more mathematical example:<p>Consider $100 in today's money. Invested at 10% annually, it will become 100 * 1.1^25 = $1,083 in 25 years. If inflation is 1%, it will require $100 * 1.01^25 = $128 for every $100 in today's money, thus the $1,083 is worth $846 in today's money. If inflation is 2%, it will require $164, or $660.<p>Despite the F/I ratio doubling, the difference is only ~22% after 25 years.<p>If you use ((1+I) - F), you can achieve the same $846 and $660 numbers with a very straightforward calculation: S_0 * ((1+I)-F)^N<p>e.g.
$100 * (1.10 - 0.01) = $846,
$100 * (1.10 - 0.02) = $660<p>EDIT: Also, you mention the it is very hard to get r below 0.9, but it's not really.

This results in less rigorously trained pilots.
Also, fewer people will fail an easier training program, resulting in pilots with less natural talent making the flight deck.<p>Modern aircraft are extremely reliable, but the AF447 incident (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AF447"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AF447</a>) showed that when the automatic systems fail, in this case due to iced-up pitot probes, the humans in the loop failed to control the aircraft resulting in hull loss.<p>The Wired article points out the differences between the Airbus side stick and Boeing yoke, additionally with Boeing the autothrottle physically moves the thrust levers.  But pilots with thousands of hours flying benign routes are considered experienced, yet are also unable to recognise a stall, a fundamental hazard to safe flight taught very early on in flying training.<p>The issue seems to be an incongruence as technology outpaces training.<p>On AF447- ""Pilots a generation ago would have done that and understood what was going on, but [the AF447 pilots] were so conditioned to rely on the automation that they were unable to do this.

For a physician who performs such a surgery, how does she choose whether it's a good idea or a bad idea for a certain patient? And keep in mind this particular patient had no negative physical side effects. She only regretted it. This leads me to believe that a physician who performs such a surgery will unquestioningly perform it for all who ask, unless there are serious medical concerns, which there were not in this case.<p>Also, the Hippocratic Oath says nothing of elective surgery. For a normal surgery, sure, the onus is on the physician to decide whether it's best. For elective surgery, the physician's duty is to decide whether it's medically OK. Otherwise, we'd have physicians picking and choosing who gets what elective surgery for reasons unknown.<p>And note, I'm personally against elective surgery, but it exists and it's legal. Someone who wants it should be able to get it without being told NO by a physician who performs such surgeries because they don't think it's a good idea for that particular patient (unless, as I said, it's a medical concern).

This would've have reduced our creativity and ability to adapt fast moving forward. Creating new stencils and adapting to new UI trends is a breeze now. With Canvas, the situation would've been different and highly coupled in the back of the Javascript code.<p>- SVG is resolution independent. While we haven't optimized Moqups for a full mobile experience YET, if you look at some mockups on any Hi-DPI (Retina) display, the experience is simply gorgeous. Printing is also a great addition, because you can virtually print huge sheets without loss of quality, making face to face collaboration great.<p>- SVG is heavily used for precise visualizations and technical drawing in industrial engineering, outside its web roots. Not sure how to properly explain this - We just kind of wanted to pay some homage to these folks.<p>The learning curve for SVG was tremendous though, with many obstacles that made us cringe and almost and quit at points. This is mostly because SVG is such an underused technology nowadays and the documentation is still scarce. However, it was extremely fun and it's nice to see that SVG is becoming more and more relevant nowadays in the context of HTML5.<p>About performance: Despite the many optimizations we have done, we still have quite a few technical debts that, once fixed, will make Moqups even faster and behave well with a lot of objects. Beside this, Chrome and others are about to introduce hardware acceleration for the SVG layers soon, so all in all, more good news.",1341936403

The messages app integrates SMS and Live chat seamlessly. Ideally this system would open up to allow any third party to plug into these hubs (and from the early signs of WP8, it will), but it's still already lightyears ahead of Apple's offering. Even Android, with it's system of intents and actions, provides more integration than iOS. I'm baffled as to why they've not tried to do anything about this.",1341936228

It has a simple JSON interface, so as far as our application is concerned, its just another API to consume.<p>Does anyone have particular insight to share on this? Last I checked, Solr's geospatial searching methods are rather inefficient -- haversine across all documents, bounding boxes that rely on haversine and Solr4 was looking into geohashes (better but have some serious edge-case problems where they fall apart).<p>Meanwhile PostgreSQL offers r-tree indexing for spatial queries and is blazing fast.<p>Am I missing some hidden power about Solr's geospatial lookups that make it faster/better than an r-tree implementation?",1341936019

QuickOffice's word processor lacks support for styles, numbered headings, cross-references, bibliographic citations, equations, automatic table/figure numbering, and a table of contents, among other things. These features are a necessity for scientific/technical writing, and it's basically not possible to write something like a PhD thesis or textbook on a tablet today.<p>I wanted these features enough that I ended up starting my own project to build a word processor for the iPad based on HTML/WebKit designed for producing these kinds of documents. There's still some way to go before it's got all the capabilities I mentioned above, and it doesn't currently support any formats other than HTML, but I already have a lot lot of the structural features plus support for styles working. I have a beta available and there's some info up at <a href=""http://www.uxproductivity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uxproductivity.com/</a> if anyone's interested in giving it a try.<p>I'll be very interested to see what Google does with QuickOffice. Google docs is considerably more powerful but still falls short on some of the document structure features of LaTeX and Word.

Helping that subscriber cut the cord and go Internet-only (while unbundling HBO) will therefore result in a lower cable bill for the subscriber. A portion of the money the subscriber saves comes out of the carrier's pocket. This is the classic trading of analog dollars for digital pennies, and carriers will resist it as long as they are able (in the absence of a new big revenue source).<p>Regarding positioning: HBO is very good at producing content, but so are a lot of the organizations that provide content to Netflix (e.g. CBS, NBC, TNT, Showtime, Disney, etc.) $8 gets you access to all of those vs. a hypothetical $5 to get the output of a single studio.

Though it would be nice in some instances, you can't run exec from a shell prompt or you'll exit the shell.  I was thinking that if I'm in the kona console, executed from a parent shell, then I could type exec from the console and run programs without forking, because it's not going to cause kona to exit.

4072497,comment,4071864,4072214,7,0,vibrunazo,,,"Why do humans are always trying to oversimplify that which is already simple? People choose to pirate because their impression is that the pros (easier, no drm, cheaper) outweigh the cons (risk of getting caught, risk of all art ceasing to exist). That's all, just a simple pros vs cons we all quickly do for every decision we ever do in our lives.<p>No need to try to find cheap pseudo-psychological explanation to why people cheat just so you can justify why you feel comfortable calling piracy ""theft"". It is what it is, trying to oversimplify the simple with pre-made labels, will just end up making the simple look complicated (as your explanation) for no good reason. Because your oversimplification is throwing variables away, you end up having to make stuff up to explain the gaps, which will always be an imprecise bandage. Which will have more gaps, and need more bandage. So you end up with these Frankenstein hypothesis that won't get you anywhere. All of this mess can be easily avoided if you accept people pirate simply because the pros outweigh the cons.<p>Now I'll just go back to building a solution instead of whining.",1338959097

You sign up for the standard internet+tv bundle, for say $60. Then you get HD for an extra $10 or $15, then the DVR is only an extra $5 a month on top of that, and then they ask you about HBO. And you think, ""I've seen some good shows on HBO, that's worth the additional small percentage of my cable bill (now up to $80/month)"".<p>And then you don't watch HBO (or at least not as often as warrants the money you spent on it). It's like all those 'options' you get when buying a car (Only $200 for floormats? that sounds like a deal!). I think it's called the bundling effect or something similar.",1338958895

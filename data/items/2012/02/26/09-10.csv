It's largely just getting started because prices for entry level smart phones are dropping but still not quite cheap enough that they are within the reach of most people.  This trend will be interesting for quite a long time and game changing apps will be both global and local.

Certain people liked platform 7 and 8 as this was closer to catching a bus or rick or just close to their home. Either way it was both good and bad.<p>The problem was the railway folks started announcing this when the train arrives at Malad or Kandivali, two stations before Borivali, even though the schedule is really fixed and does not change frequently. My mother travels everyday from Borivali-Dadar-Borivali for her job. It would be very irritating for her to get down at Malad or Kandivali, if a particular train would go to platform 7 or 8, as she has health issues esp. knee joints. We are dealing with rush to first board a train and then a rush to get down one station before your destination, too much to ask for from a women approaching 50  in my opinion. So I built this for her. I built a mobile app for her nokia phone. I coded a quick html/js page which I transferred on her phone via usb cable and then just opened it in the browser. It does not need internet. Now she's using it and suggested that I should put this up as few more people might find it useful. So here it is Borivali platform 7 and 8 app. I hope you find it useful.",1330249916

Sometimes both drinks were anonymous, and sometimes the drink was labelled as Pepsi or Coca-Cola, while the other was anonymous but actually the same drink. When the drinks were anonymous, people seemed to like both equally, but when told what the drinks were, people tended to prefer Coca-Cola over the anonymous drunk. Even more interestingly, when people were told they were drinking Coca-Cola, extra bits of their brain lit up, specifically memory and cognitive control, which suggests that when you think you're drinking Coca-Cola, it's not just the immediate sensation of drinking the coke that affects how much you enjoy it, but also the effect of all of that marketing that makes your brain think ""Mmmm, Coca-Cola is delicious!""<p><a href=""http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/briefs/mentalhealth/hb041025b.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/briefs/mentalhealth/h...</a>",1330249662

Shuffling a deck of cards doesn't ""mutate"" any cards in the deck, but you will also never get the same sequence twice.

It falls short of observing everything relevant to what our genes, and what we as individuals and as species are ""winning"" for. It might work to say such a thing on the meta scale, but it just doesnt work to say that about someone whose DNA is undoubtedly fully represented in his/her extended family, et al. For instance, my opinion of what I would call a genetic failure would be one which persists continually without ever contributing to the greater human intellect.<p>It's also worth noting that we have little knowledge of genes anyways, but that might fall on deaf ears.<p>tl;dr Someone who is a long-living nobel prize winner is IMHO, a genetic success, regardless of procreation.",1330249493

So the more I know about something, the less I want to pay for it and consequently, the tougher I bargain. My solution to get a better deal is to simply learn more. I call up contractor A with absolutely no knowledge about how to fix the problem or what costs to expect. I get some idea (and learn industry-wide terminology) and then call contractor B. I use some of my new-found knowledge to show I'm not absolutely clueless. By the time I've called contractor E, I know more about my problem than anyone else, plus I have a good idea of the expected costs.<p>2. Past relationship: I only go through lots of contractors when I don't already have a good relationship with an existing one. I didn't have to get quotes from five tile installers because I did that three years ago and found a good guy to install tiles at my old house. This time I simply called him up and he gave me a reasonable quote. You could have a past relationship with the fine-suit tailor and don't need to negotiate 50c each time because you know he is already giving you a good deal.<p>3. Quality: In the end, you pay for quality at a given price point. I don't mind the cleaners missing a spot but I do mind the tile installer messing up a center tile. You don't want to negotiate too hard with the fine-suit tailor because a 1% risk of damaging a $400 suit due to cutting corners is a lot more expensive than 1% risk of damaging a $2 pen for the same reason.<p>4. Fungibility: All $2 Bic-black pens are same, not all $400 suits are. Same with cleaners vs. tile installers or painters. You do not want to use price as the only negotiation basis when advanced levels of workmanship is involved. Price can be the primary basis when it comes to common objects or services, available in many places.<p>5. Continued relationship: I don't much care if I buy another $2 pen from the same vendor in the future because there are many good stationery vendors but I'm not going to find another tailor, painter, or tile installer as easily.<p>6. Negative perception: I don't want higher cost contractors to think I'm a cheapskate who wants a $5 discount on a $8k project because then they will treat me like a cheapskate and will make decisions based primarily on cost-saving instead of the overall value. I don't want the tailor to use cheaper thread or tile-installer to use less thinset just to lower my immediate project cost because we all know this will cost me more in the long run. I don't mind what a stationery vendor does as long as he sells me the cheapest pen in original packaging.<p>My overall point is that it's not always irrational to find a better deal for cheaper objects than more expensive services.",1330247825

3635194,comment,3635047,3635047,2,0,ivanjovanovic,,,"I was thinking about this a lot of times. There are many companies that still have more traditional approach to software development where software development process is considered as ""second order citizen"" in the process of bringing value to the users. Business oriented people in such companies are completely not aware how abilities of software enable or disable some value to be brought to the users and especially not aware how to optimize environment for better production of software in order to bring this value most efficiently.<p>Deciding deliberately not to learn to code (or at least to develop good understanding of software development process) in environment where software is expected to be the crucial part of the business is deciding to stay blind for the (most) important part of your business. From my point of view that is doomed to fail unless you are aware of that and deliberately take measures to prevent failure.<p>Someone would say that the most important is to bring the value to the users, which is not false at the end. What I saw is that business people too often underestimate how much software that brings value is part of the value itself and how it as well puts constraints on how value is brought to users.<p>Motivated by discussions with my peers regarding this topic I wrote small blog post on that some weeks ago. <a href=""http://ivanjovanovic.com/2012/02/11/nobody-cares-about-your-software-is-a-very-dangerous-point-of-view/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ivanjovanovic.com/2012/02/11/nobody-cares-about-your-...</a>",1330246927

It's just some arbitrary number that is different on platforms just for the sake of giving you a headache.

If you're picking a fight with that spectrum of opinion with respect to Israel and Palestine as being to pro-Israeli, then I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you actually just misinterpreted what I said. Easy enough to do as it is an emotionally volatile subject.<p>I have some pretty strong emotional reactions to the existence of an apartheid state. But for real peace to happen everyone will have to set aside personal and historical feelings (or rabid crazy born again send me your money so that Armageddon may come craziness) and come up with a compromise where no one is happy, everybody is still breathing, and with a full belly from supper to boot. A moving apartheid wall of course has to go, the 1967 borders form a (sans US) international consensus, and efforts to create a mutually beneficial economic interdependency have to occur. I really believe that Israel has been moving in the wrong direction. I also believe that Israel's utility to American interests will also slowly begin to wane over time and Israel should have a long term dove-not-hawk plan to survive past their usefulness.<p>You might not agree with how I presented it. But I think it's important to talk about Palestine and Israel whenever possible and the way the conversation was going wasn't productive for what this forum is from a technological, business or political view. I tried to shift it to a direction where it could be honest & productive and not get down-voted out of existence from rabidness.<p>I'm upvoting your comment because it does look like you have both parties best interests in mind as well.<p>And I'm going to try to put this into a positive note:<p>This is also might be completely naive on my part.

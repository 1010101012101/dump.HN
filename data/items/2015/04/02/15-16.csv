The separation of structured markup, display theming, and custom logic is remarkably powerful, and everyone saying otherwise is just plain wrong if you look at history.<p>Once you start doing anything outside of your simple page with a simple view (which was what, incidentally?), your engine starts to accrue features that move it in &quot;bloat&quot; towards a modern web browser.<p>The link mentions &quot;Hey, this is really useful on mobile&quot;--and I would consider that a failing of the mobile vendors browser teams, not a problem with the web.<p>This looks really flashy for the sort of static content + basic animations + interactions the author is showing off, but once you start handling further interaction--like, you know, building a virtual dom to render to the webgl texture, all you&#x27;re doing is reinventing the facilities the browser already gives you, but instead behind one more layer of abstraction.<p>tl,dr; web developers never learn.",1427990395

If you attempt to modify the markup of certain databound elements (possibly others), an error message will pop up and the IDE will cease to function in a predictable manner<p>- The VS Android Emulator is great, but it needs a bit more work.  For example, it modifies you network settings without notifying you (installs Virtual adapters).  Now if something else modifies those settings, the Emulator will refuse to start.  You have to poke around a bit with the Hyper-V manager to get things working again.  They should have a &quot;restore default settings&quot; option.  (My Emulator refuses to work now even after I removed and reinstalled it).<p>- The VS emulator would be better if it had a default &quot;Shared&quot; folder that could be used to transfer files between the device and host.<p>- You can&#x27;t specify the port you want to run Ripple on.  I believe they are planning on fixing this, but it&#x27;s a big problem at the moment as VS will just choose randomly from 40 different ports, each time creating a new folder and recreating your local databases.  This makes it hard to track down bugs, or continuing from a known state.<p>- Build support is very limited.  You have to muck about with the project settings to do trivial things like redirecting output based on Project configuration<p>- The Javascript debugger needs work.  It will sometimes break whenever a new Javascript file is loaded.  Or it will break on lines where no breakpoints have been set, even though no (visible) error occurred.<p>Other than that the IDE seems more-or-less the same as what I&#x27;m used to in VS2013.",1427990303

Both air bursts and ground bursts generate fallout, but a ground burst will generate nastier, localized fallout, and more of it.<p>This is my speculation, but I suspect another reason for the relative lack of fallout from the Tsar Bomba was related to its yeild.

The >50% of the regular fees that goes to the student council is also set by the council (e.g. it went up by a few euros in Cologne when the student ticket was extended to all of North-Rhine Westphalia instead of just the local public transit union -- which was decided by a direct vote of the students themselves).<p>Also, the public scholarship (BAföG) AFAIK didn&#x27;t cover the €500 tuition fee, so some universities advertised student loans offered by publicly owned banks (which would only cover the €500 tuition fee, not the regular base fee).<p>Anyway, the tuition fees were rather short-lived. Except for the distance learning university of Hagen (the only distance learning university in Germany, and the only non-private distance learning higher-education institution in Germany) which charges an even lower base fee but then additionally charges for the course materials (making it slightly more expensive for full-time study), the fees are generally much lower than €500 these days.",1427989874

You pay them a lot of money for this work.  When they are done they use the code YOU PAID FOR to form a company, attract investors and go into business.<p>That is theft.<p>Is this company using code and tools developed with taxpayer money to now profit?  Are investors going to profit from something that we paid for and should rightfully be in the public domain.<p>What I said makes complete sense provided the scenario I painted is correct.<p>What would it look like to not be considered theft?  Something like this: The government needs help fixing the Obamacare website.  A group of investors gets together to fund the required work.  They compete for the contract with others.  One wins the contract.  They offer their services at a reasonable cost.  The government stipulates that all software developed under this contract will be open source and in the public domain.  The company completes the work.  Now it can apply for a contract to maintain and enhance the codebase.  And so can anyone else.  We, the taxpayers, paid for the code and own it.  We did not pay to fund a for profit company that would then hild us hostage, have a monopoly based on what should be a public open source code base and create millions of dollars of profit for investors who did not fund the development of that code and took none of the risk.<p>For all I know these folks are on the level.  If that&#x27;s the case I apologize with all sincerity.  Still, I would like to see a statement clarifying whether or not a substantial portion of their now-commercial code base was paid for with taxpayer dollars under &quot;war emergency&quot; conditions and if they are effectively stealing what should be owned by the people of the US in order to form the foundation of a company that is probably going to rake in hundreds of millions of dollars per year with a virtual monopoly.

Make rules seem to expect to have only 1 output, and the workarounds like .SECONDARY prevent some features of Make from working correctly.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen this limitation in many of the fancy new build systems that get posted here on HN.<p>Is there a build system, a modification to Make, or anything out there that <i>does</i> keep track of builds with multiple outputs?

9311298,comment,9308595,9308595,0,0,zxcvvcxz,,,"A practical math topic I think all computer science (and engineering, really) students should take is convex optimization.<p>Often a problem in engineering or computer science can be phrased as minimizing a cost function over some data and/or variable constraints. Take SVM for example, or sparse signal denoising, or template matching. And far too often, people will apply &quot;advanced state of the art techniques&quot; to solve these problems, e.g. neural networks of some exotic kind, graphical models, etc. And while these are great techniques, they need not be applied to convex problems of a reasonable size.<p>In the examples I listed, I can almost guarantee that a knowledge of how to phrase the model as a convex optimization problem and throw it into an interior point solver is going to be much more effective than running stochastic gradient descent on some user-defined model with way too many (or too little) parameters.<p>Because when you say a problem is convex, what you are saying is that it can be solved globally in polynomial time (usually on the order of ~20 least-squares problems of size corresponding to number of variables and constraints). There is a sophisticated convergence theory as well. And if you understand the mathematical theory, you get to use this mature technology to solve exactly a whole class of problems you wouldn&#x27;t think you could.<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that a lot of very hard non-convex problems can be approximated and solved well using these methods, and this is a rapidly growing field of research.

Alternative systems like Ambisonics do.<p>Ears don&#x27;t hear up/down and front/back. Ears hear left and right. The _brain_ uses information from tiny deviations of the sound which are caused by your head being in the way and then decodes it as being up/down and front/back.<p>This is what binaural sound is about, meaning, if you record in stereo something using earplug microphones, then listen to that recording using earplug headphones, those tiny deviations are present in that stereo recording and it&#x27;ll cause your brain to determine the position of the sound source using that information. It&#x27;s a psychoacoustic effect, like the reverb tells our brain the room characteristics a sound is played in. We don&#x27;t actually need to be inside that room to playback a sound, we just add the reverb, the effect is good enough for our brains.<p>To me, the whole surround audio for consumers is a marketing gimmick because you can never get good enough and they can always keep selling newer and bigger speaker setups. The only adequate setup would be an anechoic spherical room, you sitting at the center and speakers in every direction possible.

I believe that. Funding this audit required ~$65k in donations, probably more than the Truecrypt project <i>ever</i> saw. If you were the developer of a project that you knew was solid, and you knew had no backdoors, how would you feel about people essentially maligning you being able to generate more cash than you&#x27;ve ever seen for your side project? That&#x27;d make me want to quit too.<p>At the end of the day, which is more preferable -- a TrueCrypt that was never audited professionally, or a TrueCrypt with active developers?<p>How can we ensure security in open-source software without driving the developers away in the future?<p>I think one way would be to match every single audit donation with a donation to the upstream developers. If it&#x27;s worth spending a dollar to audit software, it&#x27;s worth spending a dollar to keep that project alive and show the developer you care. It would have taken twice as long to get the audit funded, but maybe then the developer wouldn&#x27;t have been hounded away.<p>Personally, though, I think this audit was a colossal waste of time and resources. All it told us was something every truecrypt user was assuming already, and it cost us all Truecrypt.

9311169,comment,9296431,9308924,0,0,csandreasen,,,"> it seems like the NSA & co. would be gleefully trumpeting such a thing if they knew it.<p>I don&#x27;t think so for two reasons:<p>1) they don&#x27;t talk much about anything unless they absolutely have to for classification and vetting reasons (this gets into topics like overclassification and whether or not things are really necessary for national security - but that&#x27;s a different debate).  For example, the op-ed that Michael Hayden wrote[1] in the USA Today in response to the &#x27;NSA audit reveals thousands of violations&#x27; articles was apparently originally going to be written by the NSA itself, but the declassification and vetting process prevented a timely, point-by-point response[2].  I&#x27;m surprised that the e-mail was released so quickly.  Overall, the NSA&#x27;s response has been bumbling, and I think that has a lot to do with existing public relations policy that doesn&#x27;t fit well with a fast-moving media.<p>2) There&#x27;s a pending court case, and it&#x27;s usually good policy to stay mum about anything regarding any pending cases until afterwards.  I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s necessarily good policy now, as Snowden is probably never going to come back and face trial, but he is still indicted.<p>> Does he just hate the entire current US intelligence sector in general?  Well, he&#x27;s not keeping that a secret, so it shouldn&#x27;t really be a mark against his credibility.<p>No, it&#x27;s an indication that we should treat the leaks may have a skewed perspective, and we should keep that in mind when evaluating them.  The credibility issue comes into place when he gets on national television and tells the American people “I reported that there were real problems with the way the NSA was interpreting its legal authorities. And I went even further in this, to say that they could be unconstitutional, that they were sort of abrogating our model of government in a way that empowered presidents to override our statutory laws. And this was made very clear. And the response was, more or less, in bureaucratic language, was, ‘You should stop asking questions.’&quot;[3]  The e-mail he sent did in fact ask a question about legal authorities, but nothing like what he described to the public; there were no concerns raised at all.  Even his description of the response was a lie: instead of &#x27;you should stop asking questions&#x27; the guy said &#x27;Please give me a call if you&#x27;d like to discuss further&#x27;.  On top of that, the e-mail was sent months after he first contacted Greenwald and Poitras - he was almost on his way out the door to Hong Kong at that point.  That&#x27;s the kind of stuff that speaks to his credibility.  When you know that he hates the NSA and will make bald-faced lies on television should raise some flags when evaluating the leaks.<p>This is getting away from the Snowden credibility issue and more to issues with the reporting, but ...<p>> If he just brought every document about PRISM,<p>... for which all of the reporting turned out to be wrong.  They blew a massive intelligence source over perceived mass civil liberties violations when the truth ended up being &#x27;We can get content on specific accounts from Google/Yahoo/etc. when we present them with a court order.&#x27;<p>> or just the Verizon metadata arrangement,<p>... I probably wouldn&#x27;t have had so much of a problem if he released that one and stopped there.  Even so, the details from initial story still didn&#x27;t match reality.  On top of that, the program has debated at length in public and in Congress since it was initially disclosed back in 2005[4].<p>> or just personally hacking sysadmins at telecoms,<p>1) I don&#x27;t care that GCHQ hacked Belgacom - it does not affect me at all; 2) we still lack a lot of context behind this - Why did GCHQ break in? What information did they obtain?  Where they using this access to spy on legitimate intelligence targets, or something we would object to?  The story was presented simply as &#x27;they hacked a Belgian telecommunications company - be outraged!&#x27;<p>> or just tapping Google&#x27;s private fiber lines, or just tapping Yahoo&#x27;s private fiber lines,<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Google and Yahoo didn&#x27;t lay their own transcontinental undersea fiber optic lines.  That&#x27;s the nature of the internet - at some point your communications pass over lines owned by someone else.  I&#x27;m a lot more angry at Google for not bothering to encrypt their transnational data than I am at GCHQ for intercepting it - that means the intelligence services of EVERY country their traffic passed through had access to it.<p>> it would not be near as powerful as showing they are doing all of the above, and more!<p>I agree with you there!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/08/18/nsa-privacy-surveillance-editorials-debates/2669479/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/08/18/nsa-privacy...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/beyond-snowden-nsa-reality-check"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/beyond-snowden-ns...</a> (search for &#x27;interagency&#x27;)<p>[3] <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/nsa-releases-snowden-email-nbc-truth/story?id=23918598&singlePage=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/nsa-releases-snowden-email-nbc...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?pa...</a>",1427987735

9311149,comment,9306822,9310896,0,0,mikeash,,,"I think there are two reasons for it.<p>First is that it&#x27;s <i>easy</i>. Performance comes naturally to an electric car. Electric motors provide high power and torque, are easy to control precisely, don&#x27;t need a multi-gear transmission, and lose very little efficiency with more powerful motors. Tesla&#x27;s Model S has a 0-60 in under six seconds not because it has to, but simply because it can, and it&#x27;s relatively easy to do. Lots of people don&#x27;t care about performance, but lots of people do, so if it&#x27;s easy to satisfy that second group, why not do it?<p>Second is that it&#x27;s part of countering the reputation of electric cars as bad cars. Electric cars have long been seen as small, uncomfortable, and slow. Now we&#x27;re seeing that they can be fast. Not just fast, but brutally fast. The best way to correct a misperception isn&#x27;t merely to show that it&#x27;s wrong, but to show that it&#x27;s <i>extremely</i> wrong. It&#x27;s not necessary, but as before, it&#x27;s relatively easy, so why not?<p>Also note that range and acceleration go hand in hand to an extent. The larger your battery is, the more power you can draw from it, all else being equal. Part of why the Tesla P85D can do 0-60 in just over 3 seconds is <i>because</i> it has a 85kWh battery that gives it 250 miles of range. You wouldn&#x27;t be able to draw 515kW from, say, a 100 mile battery.",1427987646

People are ruining people&#x27;s lives. Companies demanding that employees be accessible all day every day, inside and outside of the office, is ruining some people&#x27;s lives. Their phones are merely a tool for some people to ruin other people&#x27;s lives with and that issue is not resolved by moving the notification delivery to one&#x27;s wrist.<p>I am an average person, I&#x27;m not bombarded with notifications. I get messages from my girlfriend fairly regularly, some texts from friends, and email that is at best not urgent, and worst just junk packaged up in a more pretty manner that I&#x27;ve somehow not unsubscribed from.<p>I can&#x27;t help but see smartwatches as a fad gadget with no longevity and I&#x27;m struggling to see a real use case for them. The big focus is on &quot;Health&quot;. Omg, you can track how many steps you&#x27;ve taken today?! Or your heartbeat?! Wow, that&#x27;s going to make me turn around and get my life in order, right?!<p>Well, the (presumably) massive amount of Fitbits and other wearable fitness trackers abandoned on people&#x27;s shelves would indicate otherwise. Ok, a small percentage of people will actually use these things regularly, but for most they&#x27;re a fad that will inevitably sit on a shelf gathering dust as is what happens with the vast majority of sports equipment bought by non-sportspeople.<p>I don&#x27;t need to be able to access the weather forecast at a moment&#x27;s notice, I can look out the window and get a good idea, or I can check out accuweather in the morning and see what they reckon is coming our way for the day.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just becoming more cynical as I&#x27;m getting older (and I&#x27;m not old, I&#x27;m only approaching 30), but mainstream technology seems to be delivering very little substance these days and a whole lot of trendy, heavily marketed nonsense.<p>Do I need email on my wrist? No. Whatsapp messages? No. The weather forecast? No. Facebook notifications? Absolutely not. My fitness tracked? No, not really and I&#x27;m not going to delude myself into thinking strapping something to my wrist will drastically change my habits.<p>So what do I want on my wrist? Something that will tell me the time instantly without having to fish out my phone, that will look well as a style accessory and that won&#x27;t run out of battery within a day if I decide to look at the time more frequently and none of these smartwatches deliver any of that without making large tradeoffs on looks or battery life.<p>Iphone killer? Certainly not. Even if an Apple Watch could work totally independently, the screen/the medium is not conductive to actually doing anything on it like sending a message or an email.<p>Let&#x27;s call it what it is - a fad gadget whose sales will be a testament to its marketing and not due to the value it delivers its users.",1427987005

Likelihood requires reviewing known outcomes to determine a likely result. What other known evidence of specifically these three behaviors by the Chinese government are you basing this conclusion on?<p><i>> This is important evidence for our government.</i><p>You&#x27;ve taken a massive leap in logic from a machine inside China manipulating global traffic to attack servers in the US, to conclude that <i>it is more likely to have been the Government than anyone else</i>. This is exactly the same as saying any attack originating from the US which appears to be related to US interests must be from the US government. If this was the basis for how we concluded all investigations into illegal actions, anyone who &#x27;looked like&#x27; they did it would be found guilty, sans evidence. That may be how other nations&#x27; justice system works, but not ours.<p>Furthermore, in no way is either Github or Baidu&#x27;s analytics considered &#x27;key US Internet infrastructure&#x27;. I mean, Git is even a decentralized system - people can still get work done if it&#x27;s down!<p>This is not evidence of the Chinese government&#x27;s complicity, and pretending it is creates a dangerous logical fallacy that could improperly shape public opinion.",1427986948

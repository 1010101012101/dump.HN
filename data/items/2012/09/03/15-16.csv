4470782,comment,4470547,4470759,5,0,city41,,,"Passwords are a glaring problem that <i>really</i> need a solution. Most people use the same password over and over, make their password too simple, don't remember their password, hate password requirements, etc etc. Passwords are a huge pain in the butt and a common security achilles heal. I think the worst is when I go to a site I rarely visit, so thus forgot my password for that site, and so try a handful of my ""standard"" passwords and all fail because this particular site requires at least 3 symbols in the password.<p>My personal solution has been to use 1Password. And it does help quite a bit. But I also got a license for my fiancee and she hates it. She doesn't get it at all.<p>If someone can truly and effectively solve the password problem, then they have my money.",1346687926

4470776,comment,4469543,4470142,1,0,dmethvin,,,"I don't think the assembler analogy holds with jQuery vs. JavaScript/DOM.<p>There's a reason why an event handler has a DOM element and not a jQuery object as its `this` keyword. At the time jQuery was designed, we thought everyone understood the DOM well enough to use it directly. Yes you <i>can</i> take the DOM element and wrap it in a jQuery object, but it's not always appropriate.<p>For example, `this.checked` is about 100 times faster, much prettier, and shorter to type than `$(this).is("":checked"")` [1]. No amount of optimization inside jQuery will really change that performance gap.<p>Sometimes people get a misguided belief that every access to every JavaScript object should be through jQuery. Then we get reports that `$(window).attr(""location"")` don't work. [2] So yeah, learn JavaScript and the DOM.<p>[1] <a href=""http://jsperf.com/bens-test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/bens-test</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7607"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7607</a>",1346687810

Heck right now I'd settle for even a small subset of this.<p>> Or maybe youre thinking of some sort of automatic simulation of possible failure cases when you get to the open/read/write/close operations, serving a similar roles to things like mocks and stubs in unit testing?<p>That is closest to it.  It is already known that open/read/write/close can fail.  They are quite difficult to force to fail, so currently you have to write a lot more code to make that happen.  And it gets really tedious once you look at all the combinations.  eg open has to fail, open has to succeed and then read fails, open succeeds and the 3rd read fails and on and on.  This is for a single ~5 line function!  And then if my cat() is made available to a library, how to they test for it failing.<p>I'm quite happy using supervisory programs to detect rule violations.  For example valgrind does an excellent job for memory allocation and usage, and I've never used helgrind but assume it works well too.",1346687545

I'm not talking about QWERTY or DVORAK, but modifier keys (hyper, meta, alt, win etc.) or other auxiliary keys (backspace, delete, scroll lock, undo).<p>Switching your Caps-Lock to Control is probably the most common change people do even nowadays. Some also change it to ESC (for vi users) or backspace - which, incidentally, at least one terminal had in place of the enter key.<p>If I remember correctly, way back when Erik Naggum said that he switched his numerical keys to the symbols (i.e. their shifted state) and used the function keys for the numbers (obviously on a keyboard where they're immediately above the numbers and not shifted sideways). He also moved his right-hand position one key to the right, and used the ""new"" column in the middle for braces, brackets etc.<p>So I was wondering what unusual tricks you've taught your keyboards, currently or in the past.

The main concerns I have with Javascript are:<p>1) Most frameworks try to make JS into a typical OOP language which tends to hurt performance and can make debugging a PITA.<p>2) In ""one page apps"" it can become difficult to map nodes to JS objects so things get cleaned up properly. You often see memory build ups even in jQuery because of html node wrappers and events that get cached but don't get cleaned up.<p>3) Static analysis. It's possible to get some level of static analysis if you use JSDoc but it's still very poor compared to something like C#. For example, you need to add tons of JSDoc code to make autocomplete somewhat usable. After using something like Resharper, you can really see how lack of good static analysis hurts.<p>4) Difficult to refactor large apps. Since the static analysis is poor, it's difficult to use tools to create dependency graphs, finding usages, etc... I really wish Js would just let you specify a type of an object like ActionScript 3 does. You can still use var if you want but 99% of the time an object has an expected type.<p>5) Lack of visibility keywords. This makes it hard to organize code into modules and prevent programmers from getting access to things they aren't supposed to. I'm sure there are entire debates on this point alone.<p>6) Performance. The browsers try to do tons of optimizations during runtime to speed up javascript. If you want to get the most out of JS, you really need to know about them (e.g. always initialize your class vars in the same order).",1346685829

The evidence is quite convincing that pre-agricultural humans were not so much hierarchical.  Humans are not gorillas.  It seems like various insecure nerds are very eager to project popularity issues.<p>I think depression is more about simple calorie preservation.   People in situations where they feel they have no control get depressed.  Imagine a famine.  The cheerful go-getter says ""By gum, there's food out there somewhere and I'm going to find it!""  He tramps out of camp on a hunt, and drops dead of starvation two days later.  Our depressive fellow says ""We're fucked.  I'm going to lie down and wait to die.""  He stays still and doesn't even think much, saving calories.  Then by chance a deer wanders into camp eight days later and he's saved.<p>In this age of plentiful energy and food people seem to forget how central metabolism and energy scarcity is to evolution.  The human body is mostly a machine set up to cope with highly variable energy intake.  Energy efficiency and conservation should typically be the starting point when considering these issues.<p>As recently as 100 years ago huge numbers of people in northern climes would spend most of four months of the year lying in bed in a semi-depressive state to save energy.",1246215223

What is that in equivalent mpg? Gas has 34MH/liter, which is 35800 Wh/gallon. For reference, that gives 35800/230=155 mpg.<p>With the given frontal area and Cd of that Mustang, it takes 140Wh/mile to overcome aerodynamic drag only. Let's assume they have a magic, loss-free power train. That leaves the tire drag, which should be about the same as the Tesla since they are both high-performance cars and probably weighs the same given the Tesla is dragging around all the batteries. The Tesla plot shows tire drag to be ~60Wh/mile, which adds up to a <i>theoretical minimum</i> of 200Wh/mile, which is 180mpg.<p>A more realistic assumption is that the Mustang power train (they only talk about engine so I assume it has a standard transmission) is no more efficient than the Tesla's, which requires a further 75Wh/mile. This brings us to 275Wh/mile, which is 130mpg.<p>To reach 110mpg, the engine would thus need a thermodynamic efficiency of 85%. This is more than twice the efficiency of diesel engines at ~40%.<p>It can't work.",1246214578

The sooner we start, the sooner we are safe from the next global extinction and once we are settled, nothing short of a Gamma-ray burst frying our solar system could kill us off.<p>I am not willing to bet on faster-than-light travel and finding Earth-like worlds, first because FTL must be somewhere between insanely hard and plain impossible and second because we would have first to get permission from the natives.<p>And that arrangement, provided the ludicrously lucky situation of environment requirements being compatible, would make a lot of sense - by allowing reciprocal settlement both species would be insured against extinction.<p>Sound even like the start of a nice screenplay.

Please stop using it.*<p>I can agree that LOC is a terribly abused metric, but it is not completely without meaning. It's just really rough and better left untouched in decisions involving money.<p><i>I can imagine this story being true. Just as likely, I can imagine the opposite being true. Nothing offered, nothing learned.</i><p>I think it's just an invitation to reflect on the ways that this story comes true. People mistake needless, unhelpful processes for ""tried and true methods"" and software ""architects"" frequently over-engineer and create solutions worse than the problems.<p>I'm not under any illusions that you (and most people here) don't already understand this. It probably wasn't aimed at you. There are many programmers today who don't understand that this kind of story plays itself out every day to some degree. The fact that the opposite story can also happen doesn't detract from the point that is being made.",1246213557

If you can hop in a shelter to avoid the occasional solar storm that can kill you instantly, the remaining associated risks are like smoking.<p><i>And enough shielding to block it is too heavy to launch (from earth).</i><p>Again nonsense.  Water is a very good shield medium.  You'll need to carry a lot of it anyhow, and you only need to shield a small short-duration shelter for radiation storms.<p>So we can extract the shielding from the moon?  Waste of time for exploration.  So you save on launch costs for the expedition.  How much is it going to cost to launch the lunar shielding extraction equipment?  Yes, it's desirable to have infrastructure on the moon, eventually.  But for exploring Mars, it's superfluous.  It's like Lewis and Clark needing to establish Tulsa before going to the Pacific.<p>Read Zubrin.  He's got the facts on his side.",1246213319

There are modifications to Zubrin's plan that can be implemented with existing boosters, with on-orbit assembly limited to linking together 4 components.  Seems doable to me.<p><i>However, we can't even construct a reliable artificial biosphere fully enclosed here on Earth!</i><p>Where do you get that from?  For one thing, the most publicized efforts were tried by questionable people.  I think a legitimate effort would account for things like curing concrete absorbing lots of oxygen.  For another thing, there's a huge difference between a biosphere and air/water recycling combined with local agriculture.  The point is not to get a 100% viable self-regulating biosphere.  It's just to be able to use local resources.  For initial colonization, it's just <i>life support</i> for plants.  The 100% viable self-regulating biospheres will take decades to get right, but we'll have decades and lots of economic incentive once the colonization efforts are under way.<p><i>Learn to walk before you try to run.

The environmental challenges are just about all different, so it's not even a good rehearsal.  That's more like ""Learn to swim before you run.

If it were, then you would have a reasonable complaint. The purpose of a little story like this is (from Wikipedia): ""to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, or to delineate a character trait or the workings of an institution in such a light that it strikes in a flash of insight to their very essence.""<p><i>Second, why are the programmers not taking control of management positions if they know so much better?</i><p>I see this asked a lot and I don't understand why. First of all, the traits (not skills, but traits) or interests needed for taking control of management positions are different (vastly different depending on the company) than the traits/interests needed to be a good developer. Second, don't forget that our fictional hero Charles eventually quit the company and presumably found a better place. Finding a place that fits you more is sometimes better than trying to change yourself to fit the management mold in a particular company.<p><i>I think Alan created the best product for the company.</i><p>Did you read the same story I did, or are you rewriting it into your own parable?<p><i>Now imagine how good Charles would be if he could learn to cooperate and participate in a group like Alan's.</i><p>That would be good I think. Let's also imagine how good Alan could be if he could learn to see past the inflated corporate policies, procedures, and checklists and focus on the crux of the problem.",1246212294

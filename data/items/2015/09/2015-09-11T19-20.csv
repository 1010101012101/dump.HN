10205845,comment,10204255,10204756,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Well, one can make it up as one goes along, and indeed there&#x27;s a whole strand of criticism built around the idea of revisionism, where we reconsider literary works in the light of chances that have occurred since they were written to gain new perspectives on meaning and interpretation - a trivial example would be reading older poems that include the word &#x27;gay&#x27; (as in carefree) reinterpreted in the modern context where it implies homosexuality. Everyone knows that that secondary meaning was not and could not have been in the author&#x27;s mind when the poem was composed, but the facts that we can&#x27;t &#x27;un-know&#x27; the modern meaning of &#x27;gay,&#x27; and that it is possible for such revisionist reinterpretations to be meaningful or even moving despite the demonstrable <i>absence</i> of authorial intent to create such meaning tells us something important about the nature of the reading process, and thus of the thinking process that underlies it.<p>That said, symbolism generally <i>is</i> constructed deliberately. When I write fiction it&#x27;s almost impossible for me to start at the beginning and proceed to the end - I start out with fragmentary ideas of momentary images, snatches of conversation and so on, and traverse them in sort of random fashion until the outline of a sequence emerges which suggests a plot. Various symbols will suggest themselves along the way, and one or two may &#x27;click&#x27; by encapsulating or paralleling the story structure particularly well. Once I&#x27;ve identified one of those then it acts like structural reinforcement, so I&#x27;ll go back and add it or emphasize it in various parts of the story where it seemed to fit well.<p>The symbol(s) you pick in turn become a source of new ideas for solving other plot/structure problems. So suppose I have a story about some lonely woman and I realize this person likes flowers (I didn&#x27;t decide this, I just kept picturing her eating dinner alone but always with a vase of flowers on the table so I&#x27;ll roll with it), and then it hits me that flowers have a short life and wilt and die so that&#x27;s a good metaphor for my character&#x27;s situation if she doesn&#x27;t find love. This isn&#x27;t a full story yet, though - why is this person lonely? Dunno, don&#x27;t have any ideas...well I&#x27;ll think about flowers a bit....vases...you need to water the...do you pick them or buy them...will they attract insects....oh wait, flowers use insects to pollinate, what if my character was stung by a bee and unconsciously displaced a fear of sex onto the incident? Now I have a story because I have a person in conflict with herself, impelled to seek love by the fact of time&#x27;s passage but afraid of the emotional or physical risks that entails. Hmm, not only does my lead like flowers, but has become obsessed with them - she owns a chain of florists or she&#x27;s a master flower arranger that supplies flowers for all the best weddings, and has put all the energy that normally goes into a romantic relationship into floral activities instead. Then she meets someone who&#x27;s perfect, but maybe hates cut flowers, which is a problem because my florist is obsessed with having everything just so and needs to learn to accept other people as they are naturally...well now I have a whole little world here with numerous interconnected symbols and some obvious characters and situations that I can develop, and the name of the flower store and the story is &#x27;Perfect Bouquet,&#x27; and it seems like it&#x27;s going to be a romantic comedy.<p>Exploring and exaggerating the semantic associations of the initial floral symbol has provided me with a basic plot and a handful of obvious scenes that I can begin writing immediately. Most books on writing say things like imagine your characters, find out everything about them and flesh them out in detail, then put them together and see what they do...&#x27; I guess that works for some people but I think it&#x27;s total crap. I don&#x27;t know any florists or much about flowers, apart from a summer working for a commercial flower supplier when I was young (which was basically a warehouse job). But taking a generic person, an emotion, and finding some symbol that can embody that were enough to get the ball rolling.<p>You can do this in reverse too. Sticking with the romantic comedy genre, take <i>You&#x27;ve Got Mail.</i> Meg Ryan is a proto-hipster who owns a tiny local bookstore, Tom Hanks is the ruthless CEO of a bookstore chain that wants to put her out of business, and of course they have to fall in love (via the internet, which ironically has since put a large bookstore chain out of business - see my point above about revisionist readings, because it&#x27;s interesting to ask whether Nora Ephron even contemplated that possibility when she wrote the film). 
Now the story structure is pretty generic - it&#x27;s sort of <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> set in a bookstore, and <i>BatB</i> is in turn a metaphor for mating strategies. But why bookstores? Couldn&#x27;t Meg Ryan have been a plucky neighborhood grocer being squeezed by the opening of a new Walmart store, or a feisty buggy whip maker fending off an encroaching automobile salesman. But that she sells books rather than vegetables or equine accessories suggests she&#x27;s primarily contemplative and maybe sensual, as opposed to nurturing or dynamic, that she&#x27;s a collector/curator rather than a consumer or maker, and so on and so on.<p>The process of exploring these semantic associations isn&#x27;t a scientific one, and you&#x27;re absolutely right that it can degenerate into horse shit that ends up telling us more about the critic&#x27;s inner life than the work that is supposedly under scrutiny, but the inquiry is itself informative. Why is <i>Jaws</i> about a giant shark rather than a giant alligator or bear? It wouldn&#x27;t be hard to imagine a story about a village near a swamp or a forest that was menaced by the appropriate animal and have the plot unfold quite similarly - creature features are among the oldest kinds of stories and thus among the most formulaic, but we don&#x27;t mind because they&#x27;re so relatable, as long as the personality of the Creature is developed sufficiently well. Symbols work like icebergs; the large part that is submerged (below the level of consciousness)serves as a foundation for the relatively small visible part: the authorial design is to present the reader with something whose significance is easy to underestimate but which will become clear during the development of the story.",1442001596

Whenever new concepts are discovered or developed, they often need new names.  You need to pick something that will distinguish this new concept from existing technologies.  For laughs (kind of), look at configuration management software (Chef, Puppet, Cfengine, Ansible).  They all quickly discovered that there were a whole bunch of new concepts that needed names, and while in some cases this hints that maybe these tools a bit over-engineered, it&#x27;s hard to deny they&#x27;ve been popular and useful.  Regardless, they all encountered these new concepts around the same time and they all made up their own names for them.  So in chef you have cookbooks, where ansible has roles.  Chef has roles where ansible has playbooks.  Ansible has modules where puppet has providers and resource types.

We provide both.<p>Secondly if you look at what you get for your money you will see that for the same amount you get more disk space, more bandwith, more reinstallations, etc. than WPEngine, FlyWheel and most other companies. We also don&#x27;t charge you extra for SSL usage/setup and website migration.<p>Which, I hope, for someone going around window shopping for a WP host would be quite clear.<p>Two major things that we provide however is not sufficiently clear there, one is the super powerful Varnish page caching we provide and secondly the VPS-centered architecture and all its benefits as described here:<p><a href=""https://sublimewp.com/blog/why-sublimewp-vps-centered-architecture-rocks/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sublimewp.com/blog/why-sublimewp-vps-centered-archit...</a><p>If you read the article I&#x27;d love to know what you think of it.",1442000842

But the issue we had back at the end of 2013 is that none of the other schools really knew where Waterloo was.<p>We wanted a name that people could identify with an area. And considering all of the biggest undergrad hackathons are in the USA, and completely without argument South of us... Identifying as the North isn&#x27;t really off base.<p>I believe DubHacks (U of Washington) is the only major US hackathon that is North of us.<p>Also, who doesn&#x27;t identify Canada as the North? We aren&#x27;t just a hackathon at Waterloo. Hell, over half our attendees don&#x27;t even attend UWaterloo. We&#x27;re Canada&#x27;s largest undergraduate hackathon. That&#x27;s what matters. We&#x27;re identifying as Canada at a hackathon that just happens to be in Waterloo. Basically, we wanted a name that we could use even if we changed the venue to be anywhere in Canada.<p>You got pretty bitter over the name of a hackathon. As I said, a lot of our attendees identify Waterloo as being North of them. Because it is. Its Canada.<p>As for your last sentence:<p>Does HackMIT sound like a hackathon in which you deal with problems faced only at MIT? Does Boilermake sound like a hackathon in which you make boilers? Does PennApps make it sound like its a hackathon in which you make apps for UPenn students?<p>Its a name that identifies us as Canadian without explicitly being called Hack Canada because we didn&#x27;t want to be too overarching as to bother the other hackathons in our Country.<p>Hey, who knows, maybe we eventually will make a hackathon in the style of WHacks (our 2014 April Fools prank) and call it Hack the North:

The #2 reason to block ads right now (after not making 20 connections and running half a meg of javascript that slows down your browser) is security. Malware distributors are abusing ad networks to distribute exploits. The ad networks need to do a better job keeping out the bad actors. This also ties to the privacy and spam issues as advertisers who can be trusted not to deliver malware can probably also be trusted to obey DNT and unsubscribe requests.<p>Speaking of spam, advertisers should adopt opt-in policies and avoid confusing &quot;gotcha&quot; phrasing. Things like having a large &quot;Download&quot; button that goes to the paid signup page, while the actual file download link is a tiny plain text link you have to scroll down to find. Stop that. It&#x27;s deceptive and if done in a physical store would get you sued for fraud.<p>Except I really don&#x27;t expect advertisers to do any of these things because they&#x27;re not interested in making the viewer happy, they want to make their customers happy and that means getting as many people to &quot;accidentally&quot; click on their ads as possible.

(BTW: Github adoption needed only git - already popular - and a browser.)<p>(1). I think it&#x27;s significant that your motivating problems weren&#x27;t to do with containers.<p>(2). I think &quot;scale&quot; is problematic, because although true and cool, only Amazon etc need it. But everyone loves simple, cheap and easy.<p>> <i>We&#x27;ve moved to the cloud but our tools haven&#x27;t.</i><p>(I know you meant tools in general, but) Although your StackHut tools are in the cloud, their local installation makes them seem local to users. And is a barrier to adoption. &quot;Effortless to try&quot; helps adoption.<p>Why not have webpage access, like github? If you have an API, wouldn&#x27;t a (simple) webpage driver be easy? Start with a super-simple demo, with only entering the code (like the code for your python eg), automating the rest (derive IDL and fixed dependencies). Give it a hash URL so users can actually use it from their app. Don&#x27;t require email/password til the user&#x27;s hooked, and want more customization.<p>Of course, local dev is important for debugging and iterating (with familiar tools, not some textarea/ace editor). But if your containers spin up so quickly... is it actually crazy to develop and debug in the cloud?  At least, for a demo?<p>BTW: did you see AWS Lambda&#x27;s demo for code snippets: 
<a href=""http://squirrelbin.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://squirrelbin.com/</a>
(it&#x27;s so slow because they cloud each save, load and run - instead of save+run in the background, and leave you in the editor. Actually, they use JS not py, so they could do the whole thing &quot;locally&quot; in the browser, not needing the cloud until you&#x27;ve finished iterating/debugging, to save. NB: you can&#x27;t run their code snippets as a service, so they totally missed the cool opportunity &quot;save to deploy!&quot;. Their article:
<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/the-squirrelbin-architecture-a-serverless-microservice-using-aws-lambda/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/the-squirrelbin-archite...</a> )<p>(3). If you do focus on JS, it can run in the browser... making it fast to iterate/debug, then &quot;save to deploy&quot;.<p>---<p>For 10 years, I&#x27;ve thought components over multi-core (now &quot;microservices&quot;) will be a revolution - so complete, that even entirely local software will use the architecture.  This is because components are modular; and services are a way to distribute computing over multiple cores.<p>But the arguments I see for microservices are not compelling. Scale isn&#x27;t needed by most people. Multiple languages are not a key issue for most (and solved by RDB, XML, middleware etc anyway). And it creates new problems.<p>Yet, I still feel it&#x27;s revolutionary. And I think your approach (and AWS Lambda) may be the answer: it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s clever and cool, but because it will be cheap. I think it will be &quot;Cheap&quot; for the same reasons the services in the cloud are cheap, but finer grained.<p>For devs, the finer grains enable components to be loaded only when needed, and only with the dependencies and RAM and infrastructure etc needed. Sort of, iOS&#x27;s app thinning, or Go&#x27;s tree shaking, but for resources, at the component level. Needn&#x27;t be done meticulously to get real benefit - often as easy as &quot;our business logic is simple, but the image processing part needs 8GB RAM&quot;.<p>Similarly, cloud vendors can sell more capacity if it is finer grained (because, geometrically, there are less gaps between the grains). They can therefore sell it cheaper.
It is simply more efficient for boths devs and vendors.<p>Is that how it looks from the inside, too? Is it significantly more efficient, and therefore cheaper?<p>Because cheaper, simpler, easier is the history of computing (and all technology).<p>PS: I&#x27;m taking a break before replying to the other one - glad you like &quot;json by eg&quot; schema.",1441999799

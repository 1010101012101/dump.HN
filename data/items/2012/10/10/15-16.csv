4636878,comment,4636328,4636328,1,0,pradocchia,,,"I'm sympathetic to this argument, to a point.<p>For database code, executing in the database (ie, stored procedures and the like), table prefixing does make the code more searchable, and reduces the amount of context one needs to grok a single block of code. When you need to refactor, you can quickly find all references.<p>But as a public face to clients, I find that tbl-prefixing exposes too much implementation detail. Tables and views are both relations, and there's a continuum from physical relation to virtual relation. If I use the same naming convention for both, I can keep my public API constant while iterating on the physical schema. This is very useful to me. Consequently, within the API, I try to keep views simple, and write them to provide table-like performance.",1349884732

4636870,comment,4636435,4636574,15,0,ken,,,"Garbage collection took around 40 years to become mainstream.  There are lots of important concepts that the industry still ignores.  I don't think that 'computer science being ignored by industry programmers for decades' is evidence of anything except the industry's own technical apathy.<p>Personally, I think the image model is a huge win for a single programmer, while the file model makes it easier to integrate changes from a big team.  (There's not really a ""DVCS for images"" yet.)  When I look around, I see that tools that have won tend to support big teams of less-efficient programmers.<p>So it's not really surprising to me that, by numbers, the file model dominates.  That's not an indictment of the image model.<p>What do you mean by ""better""?  There are more Corollas than BMW 5's on the streets here, but does that mean they're better, or worse, or better for a particular use case?  I'll take the image model for building a fast prototype any day, even if I have to hand it over to a big team writing C or Java for the final product.",1349884601

4636867,comment,4636365,4636716,2,0,nddrylliog,,,"You're right, that part was definitely excessive/simplistic.<p>There are probably hundreds of small start-ups trying to 'fix' mainstream video distribution right now. The point is, their scale is ridiculous compared to the ones I've listed.<p>For example, in movie streaming, you've got a few biggies: Netflix, Amazon, iTunes - and of course stuff like Ultraviolet, the studios' proprietary solutions for ""buy a piece of plastic and be able to stream them from our Windows client"". And in the smaller, you've got stuff like Indieflix, KinoNation, Izkara (admittedly more focused on indie content, because of the licensing problems I've discussed above). But none of them can expand to the size of the biggies, because the market is locked.<p>So, 'low-budget, mildly interesting indie films' is the equivalent of 'cat videos' for movie distribution. It's sad but it's true - every interesting indie flick will be spotted at a festival (e.g. Sundance) and then they'll be contacted by sales agents, whose job will then be to convince the producers that they need DRM, and that they need to sell exclusive rights to this or that entity, and then presto, that content is locked to a single/few platforms and other smallers can't compete.<p>The reason why mainstream video distribution is locked is more about social than it is about licensing, but I think the situations can be compared.",1349884579

He obviously hopes for a day soon when there are 5 or more places to go for video online that have equal market share... That will never happen.<p>Not saying Youtube will be King forever, but fragmented markets are not stable except if there are other forces at play (like government regulation, language, or massive costs to switch providers).<p>It seems that we as a society like having a homogeneous environment more than a heterogeneous one for most things.  I wonder if there are any academic studies that show that?<p>My theory is this: in this online world we live in, where there are no geographic boundaries any more, we need to have some common references when talking. Take Twitter for example - what if there were 10 other sites like Twitter and they all had equal market share? How do you get the updates from all your friends? All your friends would have to join the same one. And so worldwide, one site would grab the most market share. It HAS to be that way.<p>Or for video, let's say I create a short video clip, and upload it to 5 different video sites. Now my community is fragmented, and my fan base is divided. Eventually, one site gives me slightly more comments, slightly more traffic, slightly more shares, and then that becomes the best site to use for my type of video and I give more attention to that site. My fans go to that site as well because it has the best and most active conversation about my videos. So there has to be a favorite site for videos.<p>Not saying that you can't have a site for very specific niches. Like funny videos can be on FunnyOrDie, while Hollywood movies can use Netflix, realtime streaming can be Ustream... but people need to know where the one place to go for the content they are interested in. I think it has to be that way.<p>Can anyone think of a fragmented online business with no outside influence that keeps it that way? The only one I can think of is ""online email"", but the costs of changing your email address (time and hassle wise) is enormous so switching is not easy.<p>It's hard to explain, but to me it makes sense that in each market there is a clear leader and it requires a monumental effort to go to a new leader.<p>[edited for bad grammar and clarification]",1349884577

First off, joins.  If you had a 'post' table and a foreign key back to user_id, the naming scheme was: post_userid.  So a join would be: ""select from post inner join user on user_id = post_userid"".  There is no need to alias either table.

4636819,comment,4636328,4636328,3,0,jasonkostempski,,,"What about when you're not reviewing code or it simply doesn't matter which it is? In my experience that's most of the time. It's just something that's going to return data in a tabular fashion. I'd rather have a clean name all the time and have a little frustration sometimes. Views and stored procedures likely have more detailed and predictable names anyway, 'People' is a table, 'PeopleWithResidentCounty' is a view, 'GetPersonById' is a stored procedure. The practice also hurts what little support SMSS has for quick searching the db object list, instead of staring to type 'Pe' for 'People',  I have to type 'tblPe' quickly before the timeout. Also, if 1 person breaks the convention or misunderstands exactly how to use it and it ends up in production, the whole plan falls apart, worse if some code expects the convention to be used a certain way.  It's obviously not about machine performance issues, at that level It's about other developers perceptions. If it's just going to be you working on it, fine, whatever, but if you want to collaborate, the practice will cause many developers to question the quality of the entire project and it might reduce their enthusiasm for working on it at all. Note, I have to work on a system using this convention a lot, so it's a bit of a sore point for me, especially since I enthusiastically helped reinforce the practice many years ago :)",1349883768

The second stage's flight control software automatically cancelled its second burn, leaving the satellite in a much lower (203km x 323km) orbit than intended.

Of course, it may layer this system on top of other security measures like salted hashes and so forth.<p>As described above, two servers are used (Red and Blue). Given a password p, the Red server stores a random number R, while Blue stores (p xor R).<p>To verify whether a given password s is correct, a client first generates another random number r. It sends r to Red, and (s xor r) to Blue.<p>Red computes (r xor R), while Blue computes (p xor R) xor (s xor r), and the results are compared. The results are identical if and only if p == s, ie. when the passwords match.<p>Neither the query operations nor the data stored reveal the password to either Red or Blue in isolation; data in both servers must be combined to recover a password. The assumption is that this reduces the risk by forcing an attacker to hack both servers rather than just one.<p>To further mitigate attacks, the entries in both Red and Blue are periodically xor'ed with another random sequence R_t.<p>In other words, the entry for a user in Red changes over time as<p>R<p>(R xor R_1)<p>(R xor R_1 xor R_2)<p>...<p>while Blue stores<p>(p xor R)<p>(p xor R xor R_1)<p>(p xor R xor R_1 xor R_2)<p>and so on<p>Now the attacker must obtain both databases within the same window to recover the password.",1349881983

3171252,comment,3169678,3170100,12,0,strlen,,,"> If you're fighting with the JVM this much, why not just use C++? The problems were garbage collection, lack of control over memory layout, and bloated types. Tool for the job, no?<p>Here's why. Compare these two:<p><a href=""http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/hotspot/jdk/file/9b8c96f96a0f/src/share/classes/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentLinkedQueue.java"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/hotspot/jdk/file/9b8c96f96a0...</a> <-- Doug Lea's java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue<p><a href=""https://github.com/afeinberg/lockfree/blob/master/src/lockfree_queue.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/afeinberg/lockfree/blob/master/src/lockfr...</a>  <-- my port of above to C++0x<p><a href=""https://github.com/afeinberg/lockfree/blob/master/src/hazard_ptr_rec.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/afeinberg/lockfree/blob/master/src/hazard...</a> <-- essentially an implementation of garbage collection that's needed to to work around the ABA problem<p>tl;dr Shared memory concurrency is surprisingly hard with manual memory management. Not impossible, not infeasible, not impractical. Just <i>hard</i>.<p>C++ is still a valid choice for many products: JVM isolates you from the underlying OS, the VM subsystem, and there are cases where the cost of garbage collection is prohibitive.<p>However, I'll argue that vast majority of a site like Twitter (or LinkedIn, another high-scale JVM powered property) is best served by runtime like the JVM or CLR. Erlang is another great option, but it's more of something you'll have _along with_ JVM/CLR and C/C++: Erlang's model is (highly efficient, well abstracted) concurrency with message passing -- which is awesome, but not a full substitute for shared memory concurrency -- i.e., it's a great tool for some jobs, but not others.<p>C++ makes more sense for things like a B+Tree implementation: I've been using a pure Java B+Tree implementation -- BerkeleyDB Java Edition, and can certainly mention the negatives of that approach.<p>On the other hand, look at something like the routing layer of Voldemort, multi-Paxos implementation in ZooKeeper, or (as an example of another high scale, Java based service) the modified Paxos implementation in Google's MegaStore,  non-storage parts of Amazon's SimpleDB (written at Java at one point, in Erlang at another -- not sure what it's written in now).<p>I'll also argue that I'd rather use a less verbose and more functional language than Java -- and honestly, in some cases C++ far outdoes Java in terms of expressiveness. Go, Scala, languages in the ML family and Erlang (especially with tools like dialyzer and quick check, to get around the dynamic typing) are the right way forward for building highly concurrent user-land ""systems-y"" software (think more databases or distributed middleware than an OS) -- the parts where memory layout is critical and which tend to produce a lot of garbage can always be implemented in C/C++.<p>tl;dr Programming language choice involves trade offs, Java is too verbose, but garbage collected languages/runtimes have their role in building highly scalable applications or service",1319867392

Difficult work need not necessarily be good work. Unfortunately if you fall for this, you will end up wasting a lot of time, effort and energy over years and at the end wonder why you are not as rich as someone who does has half the difficult work as you do.""<p>A connection just went off in my head; this sentiment is echoed in Sirlin's 'Playing to Win' series of posts.<p>""Ive never been to a tournament where there was a prize for the winner and another prize for the player who did many difficult moves.""<p>It's good advice. I mean, enjoy solving difficult problems, but it is important to recognize that it can be... self-indulgent sometimes.

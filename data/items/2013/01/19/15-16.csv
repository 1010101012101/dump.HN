Cusco was created with as an effigy in the shape of a puma; a sacred animal of the Incas, Under the Inca, and the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was further divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Qontisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE).<p>According to Inca legend, the city was built by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tahuantinsuyo.<p>Cusco is a major tourist destination and receives almost 2 million visitors a year. It is designated as the Historical Capital of Peru by the Constitution of Peru. Cusco is the most beautiful place in Peru with lot kind of touristic places like Cusco city tour, Sacred Valley of the Incas, Machupicchu tours, Inca Trail trek, Inca Jungle trek, Lares trek, among others.<p>The most important that we must know before you arrive to Cusco is to know the weather condition in Cusco, Cusco has a varied weather, has a couple of season, the rainy season (from November to march) and dry season (April to October), the best time to travel to Cusco is from May to October however in rainy season is also good.",1358610811
5083694,comment,5083186,5083641,10,0,drawkbox,,,"Well in your case a fine and paying for damages. Repeat offenses maybe could constitute jail time. But wouldn't non violent crimes be better served by keeping the person out of the prison system with hardened criminals, further preventing a life of crime. In the end, is that better for taxes and society in general?  I don't have all the answers, but in many cases prison for non-violent crimes (i.e. this JSTOR case or drug cases) are misguided and perpetuate the problem.  Would you be happy if that person that stole your car was a first time offender and later found out he got caught up in a gang in prison and entered a life of crime?  Or would you just collect your insurance, buy another car, and hope that there is some non-violent offender programs that could stop that, or that over time he could repay that to insurance? We have to change that I believe, or we can expect many more situations like the recent events. I hate even talking about the private prison system we have here that profits off of incarceration of non-violent crimes.<p>In Swartz's case, putting someone in prison that is contributing to society in exchange for locking them up for 30+k per year seems completely backwards, cruel and ancient thinking. A system that can create larger criminals easily from imprisonment of minor or non-violent actions. We should at least differentiate them better.",1358610806

The only reason more experienced developers do not give into this impulse is because they've learned of the consequences through painful experience.<p>I would recommend looking at the people who contribute to Rails, Ruby and related projects on Github. The core developers will be far too expensive but people who throw some code out every so often (assuming that their pull requests are usually accepted and nobody is shouting at them in the comments) will likely know their stuff and may have reasonable prices.<p>IRC channels on Freenode such as #ruby and #rubyonrails will likely prove useful too. Look out for people who answer a lot of questions (and get them right). One strategy is to try to design a solution for a feature by yourself, then summarise the design (i.e. show the relevant code snippets) in a Github Gist or pastebin page and ask for feedback. If there are any glaring faults or simply better ways to achieve the result then they will be pointed out to you.",1358610408

As someone said above, doing at least some of the technical legwork yourself will buy you a ton of credibility with experienced programmers when you go to hire.

Often the client thinks it should X should take Y long, and you're telling them that X might not even be possible, but you can do X' in 4 or 10 Y. ""What do you mean?

That's already what I'm doing mostly everywhere. And it seems to me like most people do and like this is somewhat accepted as the best available option - but still not perfect.<p>Then I am wondering again: Isn't there really a perfect solution? Esp., the problems with Unix timestamps are the non-monotony and that e.g. two equal timestamps can actually represent two different times (seconds). This could be bad in cases where seconds matter (e.g. some log-files which need to be very precise about time).<p>Maybe TAI is and we all should store TAI timestamps instead of Unix timestamps? But is there an easy way to get TAI timestamps? Also, I haven't really seen other projects doing this - why? Maybe it is just too little gain over Unix timestamps and too less tools available to work with them... Btw., I just checked, there is <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/libtai.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/libtai.html</a> and <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tai64n"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tai64n</a>, maybe I should just start using that.<p>This of course still doesn't solve anything about synchronization or inaccurate system clocks but it would be better than Unix times.<p>Edit: Getting the TAI timestamp is probably not easy or maybe even not possible...

You should be able to look around but still control your aim separately (just like how you do it now with a mouse or control stick).<p>A lot of people I talk to think the Oculus Rift isn't high enough resolution to be successful. I can see that complaint because on paper it does look low resolution compared to what we're used to now on traditional monitors. But in practice, the low resolution of the Oculus Rift did not bother me one bit. More pixels would have been nice but not necessary at all.<p>Bring on the Oculus Rift!

5083633,comment,5082532,5082532,6,0,IsaacL,,,"I wrote a pokerbot for my university third year project: <a href=""https://github.com/IsaacLewis/FYP"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/IsaacLewis/FYP</a>. I haven't been able to spend any more time on that project since finishing it (though I wanted to), but I still find the space fascinating.<p>Unlike the linked bot, which is an ""equilibrium"" (or ""game-theoretic"") player, mine followed an ""exploitative"" strategy. What's the difference? Equilibrium strategies find  (or attempt to find) a Nash equilibrium, and follow that. As the OP said, this minimises their losses, but also prevents them exploiting weaknesses in an opponent's playing style. Wheras an exploitative player adapts its strategy to take advantage of its opponent, but that leaves it open to being exploited itself.<p>The OP used RPS as an example - it's clear that the Nash equilibrium is picking each move with 1/3 probability. No matter what your opponent does, your expected value is 0. But what if your opponent decides that they will always pick rock? The EV of the equilibrium strategy is still 0, but you could switch to an exploitative strategy of always picking paper, in which case your EV is 1. For this reason, exploitative strategies will almost always win multiplayer RPS tournaments, because they can consistently beat the weaker players, whereas the equilibrium players will stay in the middle of the pack. It might seem like a surprising result that playing an exploitative strategy <i>always</i> leaves you open to exploitation yourself, but the maths works out.<p>If you an intuitive grasp of this idea, consider that to exploit your opponent's strategy, your play must be adapted based on observations of their play. But this means they can play with style X, leading you to play style X' which is dominant, before they catch you out by switching to style X'', which dominates X'. If you have experience playing poker with competent humans, they do the same thing.<p>In computer poker, AFAIK equilibrium players generally perform better. I think this is because poker is a more complicated game than RPS, so both humans and bots consistently make mistakes, so just playing solidly gives equilibrium bots the edge. But writing an exploitative bot is still pretty interesting, because it seems closer to human poker, which is more about bluffing and outthinking your opponents than mathematically optimising your play.<p>My bot wasn't especially interesting - it was based on an existing algorithm called Miximix, and I used Weka to try and machine learn a model of the opponent's strategy. Still, it could do interesting stuff - eg, if it played against an opponent that could be intimidated out of hands by large bets, it would realise that it could bet large without having good hands - ie, it successfully taught itself to bluff. What I thought would be really interesting was a bot with multiple-level opponent modelling - ""what does my opponent think I have?"" or ""what does my opponent think I think he has?"". Good human players think this way, and ""recursively modelling other minds"" seems integral to conscious thought, so it'd be cool to look into in more depth.<p>The other thing that would be cool to look into is ""explanation-based learning"". Normal machine learning approaches require large amounts of data to draw inferences, but human poker players seem capable of forming conclusions about their opponent based on very limited information. Explanation-based learning uses a domain model to help this.<p>Hmm, writing this comment has reignited my interest in this space - I really should dig out my old code and work on this again some time.",1358609463

There is a bit of discretion available, but in general, expect prosecutors to press for maximum overall enforcement of the laws. This is how it works and how we expect law enforcement to act. The laws were generally put in place by legislators duly elected by their constituents. We expect the executive branch to execute, not legislate. Orin's posts seem to be simply pointing out that this case is business as usual. If we don't like it, this should gravely concern us. This type of prosecution is ho-hum, and not just in matters of technology.<p>Given that the state always has more resources available than individuals it prosecutes, cases like Aaron's are powerful arguments for a limited government. A real limited government, not the kind that just keeps hands off hackers and turns their arsenal of weapons on another class we care about less. I realize this perspective is completely out of vogue these days, but the fact that governments oppress individuals is an age-old truth that needs to be relearned over and over, it seems.<p>Asking prosecutors to be ""nicer"" won't cut it. Nor will firing one and replacing them with another, tasked to enforce the same law. We must remove some of their power, meaning many laws need drastic change or repeal. It's sad that it takes a high profile individual to raise concern when plenty of others have been destroyed before and gone unnoticed.",1358608569

Leaving aside the fact that Unix Time enumerates no such thing (and it was Unix Time I was discussing), there are such things as time frames and relativistic effects which come into play when doing fine scientific measurement, astronomical work, and ground satellite communications.<p>There are levels to dealing with time and the linked article makes a decent first order stab at climbing the ladder, even ground based programmers need to be wary of the leap seconds issue and the plethora of time standards with minute but significant (in some context or another) issues.<p>When you've cooled down a little consider the title ""What <i>every</i> programmer <i>should</i> know ..."".

And you can't install such a software without giving the root/admin password of your system.  And you cannot legally use a VPN: if they detect one you're out (you still technically can if you manage to fly 100% below the radar).  And you can't use remote desktops.  It's overall very restrictive.<p>They're regularly busting bot-rings and chinese-colluders rings and confiscating their money (and redistributing it to other players).<p>And if they suspect an account of multi-accounting, they'll do tricky things like moving and resizing all the poker tables at once, while simultaneously showing a captcha.<p>If you fail to enter it, you'll have a hard time convincing the site to not confiscate your money...<p>But back in the wild wild west days, it was amazing: some people had ""war rooms"" made of tens of PCs, all playing online poker and making very very big money.

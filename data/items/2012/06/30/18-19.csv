The argument works well for sport stars: A football team, that draws a crowd of 50,000 to a home match every two weeks, produces something like $25,000 per week per player. By contrast a slightly worse player who is never playing in a big league will at best generate 1/10th or 1/100th of this numbers. The crucial point here is, that the players are exploiting their personal skill to do this. \nBy contrast in the case of an CEO, the immediate value is created by workers. ( The guys in the factory who actually assemble a product, not by R&D and not by the CEO himself). The CEO is merely responsible for creating an environment were the workers can effectively create value. Therefore the wage is not only based on his personal skill, but also on the skill of others.<p>The later sections of the essay are sometimes simply a libertarian straw man (  The Daddy Model of Wealth), sometimes very good ( in particular the second half of ""The Lever of Technology"").",1341081047

CollabraCam streams video from up to four iOS cameras over local Wi-Fi to a fifth device for the director to view and edit video from the streaming cameras in real-time, while allowing the director to give instruction to the camera operators by communicating camera moves, angles and shot selections, etc. When the director calls it a wrap, the video clips are transferred to the director's device and assembled into a single video with automatically generated credits. You can learn more here: http://collabracam.com/<p>For us to be eligible for the grant we must get 250 votes.

The web has managed fine without one, so possibly search across a flat collection is a better metaphor. There are numerous others.<p>There are, however, interesting possibilities that make files less conspicuous, apple are experimenting with this, where there are pipes between apps, I open a photo, send it to snapseed, pipe it on to tumblr. At no point am I confronted with a file save dialog. Obviously it's a file under the covers, but that's just an abstraction. Files themselves are abstractions.

It sounds like what you are really saying is that programmers need to be certified by a professional trade organization, following a period of 2-6 years of education and apprenticeship, enforced by law.  After all, that is what separates doctors, dentists, lawyers, and accountants from other professions.  (Race car drivers have contracts and other measures to enforce exclusivity, as racing is generally illegal except on dedicated courses or in licensed races.)<p>Programming is a skill/trade.

Let me be more precise: the middle class has only shrunk because people have moved from X to Y, where $25k < X < $75k and Y > $75k. I.e., no one became poorer, and some people became richer.<p><i>The facts -- income stagnation and wealth inequality -- are in direct opposition to your ""the disappearance of the middle class is fine, they're just getting rich"" fantasy. People have either gone to exceptionally above 85k, are stagnant, or are dropping towards the lower end.</i><p>No one is dropping towards the lower end. The number of people at the lower end (below $25k) is the same (about 25%). Since the number of people between $25k and $75k shrank, it must be because the number of people above $75k increased. That's just basic arithmetic.<p>You still have yet to show how people's income exceeding $75k causes any harm at all, short of vague hints that it's almost impossible for them to spend anything like what they make.",1341079400

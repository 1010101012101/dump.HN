8574869,comment,8574299,8574299,0,0,webjprgm,,,"Very interesting. As a white male, the closest experience I have is living for a couple years in Venezuela and Chile. Chile not so much, but in Venezuela I was frequently harassed with anti-American phrases. But I wasn&#x27;t a child so it didn&#x27;t affect me the same, I knew that back in my own country I would be respected and fit in perfectly and that I would head back soon enough, and I was never accused of a crime (other than being accused of being in the CIA by passers-by).<p>Is this experience even close?<p>I might point out that I also felt discriminated against when trying to get scholarships, since such a huge percent of the help goes to non-whites or those in lower income classes. As a middle class white boy wanting to go into Computer Science I got almost nothing. In theory this counter-discrimination is supposed to make up for the racial discrimination to try to level out the economic privileges. I&#x27;d really like to get rid of both.<p>I note that since I wish discrimination did not exist I tend to pretend that it does not. Perhaps this is part of the problem. But I have never called anyone a racial slur and I try to counter any racial biases I find in my own thinking. So I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m part of the problem.",1415397512

8574851,comment,8571879,8573950,0,0,ulber,,,">In this particular case, the fuzzer is going beyond just throwing random input, as it considers which changes to the input trigger new code paths in the target binary, and therefore should have a higher success rate in triggering bugs compared to just trying random stuff.<p>To expand on this, techniques like this are called whitebox fuzzing (or maybe graybox in afl&#x27;s case). In their extreme whitebox fuzzers even incorporate constraint solvers to directly solve inputs that take the program to previously unexplored paths. One very impressive project is the SAGE whitebox fuzzer [1,2,3] that&#x27;s in production use at Microsoft (an internal project sadly). I work in the related field of automated test generation, but all my tools are very much research-grade. However, in SAGE they&#x27;ve done all the work of figuring out how 24/7 whitebox fuzzing can be integrated into the development process. I am somewhat envious of the researchers getting to work in an environment where that is possible. If you&#x27;re interested I very much recommend reading the papers on SAGE.<p>[1] Poster about SAGE: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/public_psfiles/SAGE-in-1slide-for-PLDI2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/public_psfi...</a><p>[2] An approachable article on SAGE: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/public_psfiles/cacm2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/public_psfi...</a><p>[3] The paper with all the details: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/atg/ndss2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/atg/ndss2008.pd...</a>",1415397354

8574835,comment,8574184,8574184,0,0,Animats,,,"The article is a lightweight analysis by someone who writes small programs.  He does get that, for Rust, &quot;If the compiler accepted my input, it ran — fast and correctly. Period.&quot; That&#x27;s was a common experience with the very tight languages, such as Ada and the various Modulas.  It&#x27;s been a while since a language that tight was mainstream.  We need one now, badly.<p>Go isn&#x27;t bad for writing routine server-side web stuff that has to scale and run fast, which is why Google created it. Go is a modern language with a dated feel.  No user-defined objects, just structs.  No generics or templates. It was designed by old C programmers, and it looks it.  Go has generic objects - maps and channels - and syntax for creating object instances - &quot;Make&quot;.  Only the built-in generics are available, though; you can&#x27;t write new ones.<p>Go&#x27;s &quot;reflection&quot; package thus tends to be overused to work around the lack of generic. This means doing work for each data item at run time for things that could have been done once at compile time.  &quot;interface{}&quot; (Go&#x27;s answer to type Any from Visual Basic) tends to be over-used.<p>Go (especially &quot;Effective Go&quot;) has a lot of hand-waving about parallelism.  Go&#x27;s mantra is &quot;share by communicating, not by sharing&quot;, but all the examples have data shared between threads. The channels are just used as a locking mechanism. Race conditions are possible in Go, and there&#x27;s an exploit which uses this. (That&#x27;s why Google AppEngine limits Go programs to single threads.)\nGo doesn&#x27;t use immutability much, which is a lack in a shared-data parallel language with garbage collection. If you can make data immutable, you can safely share it, which is a way to avoid copying without introducing race conditions.<p>Rust, like Erlang, takes a much harder line on enforcing separation and locking.  I haven&#x27;t used Rust myself yet, so I can&#x27;t say more on what it&#x27;s like to use it. My hope is that Rust will provide a solution to buffer overflows in production code. After 35 years of C and its discontents, it&#x27;s time to move on.  I really hope the Rust crowd doesn&#x27;t fuck up.",1415397249

There was something similar,  1985 book: The Silicon Idol: The Micro Revolution and Its Social Implications.<p>What I really think is that we haven&#x27;t yet started to understand the kind of higher older problems that we may have to cope with, there known unkowns and unknown unkowns, and I think we are in the quadrant in which unexpected things can happen, but as always we will try to seek solutions in our comfortable zone.  I haven&#x27;t read the book, only some  fragments on the web.<p>Perhaps someone can add some good opinion about this. For example the concept of Taleb about resiliance and how systems should be designed to fail, and how our models don&#x27;t take into account the real risk and the black swam of the future.  It seems to me that the author is not a computer scientist or a mathematician and so some concepts maybe lacking that others could read in the design of systems. Just as an example I found this in Carr blog, http://www.roughtype.com/?p=1610 (from 2012):<p>Carr: I don’t fully understand this excerpt from Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s forthcoming book Antifragile, but I found this bit to be intriguing:<p>John Cook (famous blogger on math and stats) tries to explain a statistical fact from this fragment of Taleb that Carr find difficult to grasp.

8574810,comment,8574299,8574701,0,0,acjohnson55,,,"Europe often has a different manifestations of racial issues, in my experience. Some feel that racism there isn&#x27;t so cloaked and ingrained in the culture, see [1] for example.<p>It was in Austria that I, a black guy, along with 2 white American guys, were stopped and interrogated by police in one of the large public parks. They peppered us with a whole bunch of questions of who we were, where were our papers, where were we coming from, where were we going, etc., before letting us leave. As a black dude, my instinct when released from the cops is to non-threateningly disengage as quickly as possible. But one of my white buddies asked the cops why they had stopped us. One cop told us point blank that there were a lot of black guys dealing heroin in the parks, and they wanted to make sure I wasn&#x27;t up to no good.<p>It&#x27;s kind of darkly comical, but I&#x27;m pretty sure if you had snapped a photo of us at the moment, you&#x27;d have seen two white dudes with their jaws agape and who knows what my face looked like. I remember clearly feeling a mix of feelings. Sure, I felt some anger and annoyance at being hassled simply because I was black. I felt embarrassed for being the reason my buddies were also hassled. Mostly, I was just like, &quot;wow, I can&#x27;t believe they admitted that&quot;. In a small way, it was a vindication of all the times I had felt marginalized because of my race, but couldn&#x27;t say for sure. And as racism is so hard to explain to non-minorities, I was kind of thankful my two friends were there to witness it. Quite frankly, their minds were blown.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/black-body-re-reading-james-baldwins-stranger-village"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/black-body-re-rea...</a>",1415396857

Because that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m getting out of the regex example given.<p>Of course any function can be forced to crash by inserting some crash-inducing code into the function. You can always make a function that assumes that value is of a certain form, and crashes the program if it is not (like unwrap for extracting a value from an Option, or crashing if it there is no value). In order to have &quot;code that works if it compiles&quot; (comparatively speaking; often used as an exaggeration), you have to have the discipline to use the facilities that the language provides you.<p>I guess a language would need some kind of totality checker in order to make sure that you couldn&#x27;t make function diverge in some way. Like for example Idris has.<p>Rust also has the `!` type, aka bottom, for marking functions that diverge.<p>> So far as I know the fail! macro still exists in Rust.<p>What should that do? Crash the program? If so it should have been renamed to something like `panic!` now, since &quot;fail&quot; now is associated with Error types, while &quot;panic&quot; is associated with crashing the program/exceptions.",1415396050

A lot of things I wish Ruby did, Go does great.<p>I think Go does really well in tooling, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as great in syntax or language features that I would really like. The two big ones I wish Go had were named parameters on functions, and immutable data structures.<p>It&#x27;s probably a blub paradox thing, but my ideal language has immutable data structures and named function parameters. Kotlin, Scala, and Swift all kind of nailed these features, but Go has not.<p>For me, named parameters and a little verbosity goes a long way to allow me to communicate intent in my code. Immutability allows me to have a built in sense of safety that once the data is set, it stays that way.<p>In my experience, a whole class of problems goes away when you have those two features (alongside the many other features we&#x27;d expect form a language like Go).<p>What I felt from Go is that a year ago when I was playing with it, that they didn&#x27;t care much about either of those two features, which is fine, but it keeps go from being my ideal language.<p>Swift I wish was a bit more general purpose, Kotlin and Scala don&#x27;t compile as fast as Go, and Ruby doesn&#x27;t have a compiler to do some of the checking I wish it would.<p>Go&#x27;s fast compile times with something like Ruby&#x27;s syntax and a feature set similar to Kotlin/Swift would be darn near perfect.<p>For me, there is no perfect language.",1415395798

8574673,comment,8574299,8574299,0,0,acjohnson55,,,"When I first read this story in Princeton Alumni Weekly [1], it reminded me so much of my own upbringing. My parents grew up in inner city Detroit and Gary, but fortunately came of age in the 70s, at a time when higher ed was becoming much more inclusive. This gave them the means to get out, just as those cities were beginning to crumble. They raised my siblings and me in a nice upper middle class suburb of Chicago. Like the author and his wife, my parents raised us from a very young age to know a  behaviors to exhibit around authorities and non-black people, so that we would appear as non-threatening as possible.<p>Reading the story brought back a memory I&#x27;d almost forgotten. My father, a lifelong golf fan, sent my brother and me to golf camp in Wisconsin. I was probably about 14 and this was right around the time Tiger Woods first went pro. So golf suddenly seemed like a viable sport to young black kids like us -- it had been less than a decade since Augusta National had admitted it very first black member. At camp, I remember hearing the word &quot;nigger&quot; yelled at us from a truck speeding by a road adjacent to the course. My brother and I had never experienced such racism up until that point and were basically frozen. One of our teammates thought quickly and yelled &quot;rednecks&quot; back at the truck, and to our teenage minds, the score had been more or less evened. No one ever talked about what happened, and we sure as hell didn&#x27;t tell my father, who likely would have been as upset as the author of this piece.<p>I can&#x27;t say that this particular event stands out as a watershed moment of racism in my life, however. Far more frustrating were the countless microracisms I endured growing up. A feeling (and reality) of not belonging socially, exclusions from group outings, always standing out like a sore thumb, off-color remarks, overt distrust from friends&#x27; and girlfriends&#x27; parents, and so forth.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until my late teens that developed the confidence to turn my difference into a strength in many cases. Developing that ability allowed me to be much more successful within the dominant culture, although it&#x27;s never too long an interval between overtly racial situations. In my twenties, I&#x27;ve been questioned by police specifically on account of my race and I once had to date a girl secretly because her father had told her he would disown her for dating a non-white guy. At a middle class suburban bar,a totally random guy I&#x27;d never seen before tried to fight me after telling me a &quot;a nigger fucked my wife&quot;.<p>But I&#x27;m on the very lucky end of the spectrum. I&#x27;ve benefited from all sorts of privileges in my life. So many minorities face an intersection of circumstance that can deprive them of privilege. We can never fully banish discrimination, but I share this in hopes that people will read one person&#x27;s experience, understand that these issues are very real, and want to learn more.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2014/10/08/pages/7596/index.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2014/10/08/pages/7596/index....</a>",1415395167

You don&#x27;t like the long hours of work with meager pay and high living costs? You don&#x27;t like coming in on the weekend? You don&#x27;t like leaving at 9+ pm? Quit and good luck finding a job in the tech scene here, forever banished to the life of high hourly wages from contract jobs serving some American overlord, getting paid for overtime, not having to commute for hours in the crap public transportation system.",1415394254

People are a lot less racists now, but somehow a culture has to be created which has to explain why in an era of low racism some groups are more backwards than the others, or why &#x27;affirmative action is still required&#x27;.<p>All you end up doing is create a class of entitled progressives who think that somehow their lives were better because they are white/male/etc.<p>Do you know why people tend to be racists? They tend to be racists because at the end of the day believing that somehow the &#x27;average&#x27; of their group being better than the other groups makes their own shitty existence better. So your life sucks, you don&#x27;t have a job, you are fat as fuck, but thank god you are white.<p>People apologizing for White privilege tend to embrace it for the same reason(its not like they can experience it, it is always a second hand experience).",1415394206

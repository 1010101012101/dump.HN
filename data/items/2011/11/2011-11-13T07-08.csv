I can see why things like the windows not maximizing, etc. would be annoying. Here's a perspective, though:<p>1. That issue of windows not resizing is generally a complaint made by native Windows users who are already <i>used</i> to that property. I'm not saying this makes it an invalid complaint, just putting it in context.<p>2. Compared with Linux, Mac OS X has more support (this doesn't mean it's superior). Compared with Windows, Mac OS X (at least in my experience) is more sensitive to power users and coders, and people who know what they're doing more. Now, I've used different distributions of Linux, and ideally, I love Linux most. But it just doesn't have as much support as Mac OS X because proprietary backing breeds rapid progress (in the sense of universal or near universal support at least). Sometimes you have to fork your own solution when you're confronted with a problem in Linux.  This also happens in OS X, but often times, there's more trouble shooting advice or solutions freely available and accessible. Just a perspective.",1321170466

Adjusting the system when productivity is already low is one of the worst times to do it, because there's very little to take up the slack.<p>On the other hand, Greece probably needed a crisis like this in order for it to face up to its governance problems.<p>I don't know why you quoted ""don't know better""; I didn't say that, nor anything like it, as far as I understand.

If they had a national lender of last resort, they could essentially monetize the debt, causing inflation, and pay their way out with their devalued currency.<p>The Greek economy is not fundamentally different than it was when it was accepted into the EU.  France and Germany knew that then and know it now.  They just want to have their cake and eat it too.  They loaned money to a country that had little hope of paying it back.  It's fun to say ""it's all the debtor's fault"" but there are two sides to every debt relationship and in this case, as much fault lies with France and Germany as it does with Greece.<p>Also, Iceland didn't go through the forced austerity that is being pushed upon the Greeks.  The Icelandic government essentially defaulted when it nationalized the banks.  There was no ""We'll give you a bailout if you crush your economy through austerity programs"" from the EU because Iceland is not an EU country.<p>Austerity only stops the bleeding to foreign creditors at the expense of the country's citizens.

3230255,comment,3229360,3229360,3,0,podperson,,,"I think there's a difference between being pleasant and being good and the writer of the linked article appears not to. A lot of good people aren't especially pleasant (Richard Stallman, much as I disagree with many things he says, might serve as a nice example). Jobs certainly seems to have been unpleasant in many ways, especially when he was young.<p>As far as I can tell, Jobs is guilty of three major sins in the book:<p>1) He screwed Woz on the Breakout deal. (Well-documented.) He did not screw Woz on the Apple IPO, however, and made him a very rich man.<p>2) He behaved abominably to his daughter Lisa's mother, but tried to make up for it later. Lisa's mother comes across as a dissolute user (e.g. she cons Lisa into signing over a house Jobs had given her to live in but bought in Lisa's name, and then sells it to go traveling with her guru). We don't know if Jobs had reasons for what he did, but Lisa chose to live with him.<p>3) He screwed Kottke out of equity in Apple during the IPO, deciding that his contribution was insufficient. This seems pretty unfair based on what we learn (which isn't much) in the book.<p>That's it, as far as I can recall. There's probably a few minor things, but those are the ones that stuck with me. Aside from that there's a lot of screaming, shouting, and whining, but it's basically pretty much a story of an incredibly dedicated guy trying to make great products and not really caring about money.<p>(How is Jobs supposed to have used Ives? By making him rich and giving him a huge amount of power?)<p>If you wrote the life story of pretty much any businessman, I think you'd be unlikely to find fewer immoral acts.<p>He also did some really mean things to some of his friends early on, but -- at least in most cases -- he owns up to them and tried to make amends. This is not like, say, Bill Gates who pretty much screwed everyone he did business with at some point and rationalizes it all away. But hey, he's curing malaria now so all is forgiven. (Bill Gates also comes across as an asshole, not to mention unhygienic and smelly, in various biographies.)",1321169633

However, there are studies that say a glass of red grape juice give similar benefits as one drink. I don't know anybody who follows that advice with any discipline, though.<p>Not drinking doesn't affect my social enjoyment in the least. First, I find that most professionals (my social group) these days drink less than they did 10 years ago. But I was in a social fraternity in college and have no problem being at parties, bars, clubs, etc. with other people who are drinking. In fact, it's the opposite - I've found my NOT drinking affects the enjoyment of some drinkers. They get self-conscious about it, perhaps guilty. People don't want to drink alone, so if I'm with only one other person they usually won't imbibe. And I've found that those who are actively agitated by my not drinking are those who are alcoholics or marijuana addicts. That's rare, and they stop socializing with me, but I'm dodging a bullet and I'm not at a loss for friends.",1321169616

You'll think it's just coincidence, but in reality you secretly remember the toilet is an awkward place where you magically solve the problems that you were stuck with all day. It's way of thinking, releasing yourself from stress to focus on the path you want to go with your planning and code, not so much theory here. It's not enforcable.<p>The only room, where you're alone with yourself and where you relax your inner muscles. As you know, every contraction happens in your cerebrum first, this relaxation acts as stimulus for something I can't explain.<p>Planning, Development, Strategy and Success aren't entirely seperate, they live in symbiotic co-existence and strengthen each other. That's why many people say ""You first start coding and the rest will follow"". In reality this is an illusion, you can't code without planning or strategy, it's fueled by hard trained routine and effective problem->solution matching. You know it: The more you code the better you become and success boosts you into new directions.<p>We've all experienced it, sometimes you're better than usual and you want that effectivity back, when you're stuck and don't know a solution. Call it flow if you want, but I think it's peeing problems away :)<p>My routine is to do more learning than planning.

Greece's situation is comparable to that of California (although not to the same extent).<p>While many economist agree that austerity doesn't bring growth, at least it stops the bleeding.

While I would certainly love to see more progress, this is utter nonsense.<p>According to <a href=""http://cleantechnica.com/2013/07/08/40-drop-in-ev-battery-prices-from-2010-to-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cleantechnica.com/2013/07/08/40-drop-in-ev-battery-pr...</a>, EV batteries were over $1000/kwh in 2010, and then ~$650 in 2012.

This lines up with a fairly consistent drop in price of 22.5% every year.<p>So what does this revolution consist of?<p>30% cheaper batteries in two years when it&#x27;s available, on top of existing progress. So not bad, but also not particularly revolutionary.<p>The other irritating strawman relates to the second point of the article. The suggestion that product improvements these days are always based on innovation in the product itself, rather than how it is manufactured.<p>Apple&#x27;s entire product line at this point is reliant on manufacturing innovation.

RFC 822 said &quot;years are two digits&quot; and people wrote parsers to that spec. Even now the official rule (AFAIK) is two or four digits, not an arbitrary number of digits.<p>And even when the spec has no limit, implementations often intrude. For a more current example, JSON has no &quot;natural&quot; numeric size limits, but interoperability of integers greater than 2^53 is problematic because some implementations assume double-precision floating point while others can parse larger numbers into a 64-bit integer.<p>Limits are a part of protocol design; a good protocol should make them clearly defined, suitably sized, and feasible to change.",1435031667
9762520,comment,9761821,9762414,0,0,jib,,,"They are saying that the variation in tests can be lowered by including covariant variables in selection criteria. Let&#x27;s say one product of many I sell a &quot;drivers license test kit&quot; and somehow know the age of my site visitors. I have an idea of how to change how I advertise the kit on my website. Most of the people who would buy the kit are in a very specific age bracket (16-20 year olds depending on legal age in your country). My site has an even spread of visitors ages. if I random split my test pool and it ends up with an imbalance in ages my results will be skewed so I can lower amounts of tests needed if I don&#x27;t form test groups OR control groups where all 16-20 year olds are on one side. I &quot;know&quot; those tests would be irrelevant so I just don&#x27;t run them. If they would have yielded relevant results I&#x27;m screwed but if not, I saved time.<p>For your 1 and 2, yes and yes. They measure different things. But I can see that &quot;a test population of site visitors of an even age distribution&quot; would yield answers faster than a random distro. You are asserting a belief rather than testing for it, adding a given, so reducing problem space, so trading lower variance in results for higher uncertainty of the significance (because maybe your assertion that age drives interest is wrong, and then all tests are wrong). P (this test is totally meaningless) goes up, but P (if this test is meaningful the results are likely close to true) also goes up? That&#x27;s how I read it at least.",1435031665

So, the problem is that most people wind up talking past one another in different domains.<p>HTTP is unusual in that it is highly structured <i>now</i> in spite of having started life as highly unstructured.  In addition, once people start using https more and more, we&#x27;re going to have to use binary decoders on HTTP streams anyhow.  So, binary http is really fait accompli, we might as well standardize it.<p>However, I have a very strong aversion to binary formats for anything persistent that has a lifetime in the range of year+.  I have had to grovel through <i>FAR</i> too many binary formats with a hex editor because the program that created them no longer runs because of OS, language, or computer upgrade.

The goal is that the distribution of your two groups across all possible metrics you can measure are as close to equal as possible. Some trivial (and obviously extreme) examples of the medical field could be:<p>a) If you&#x27;re doing a study with 50/50 males and female participants, you&#x27;d probably reroll your control/active group distributions if it was far off from 50/50. Hell, you&#x27;d probably just split males and females separately.<p>b) If you had a twin study, the only way to divide up your population that makes sense is by splitting up your twins. Nothing else makes sense.<p>c) Imagine you wanted to test how Adderall effects the test studying/taking abilities of a variety of college aged students. You would do your best to make sure that your control/active populations have similar distributions in your test metric (or test metric proxy such as IQ) prior to starting test.<p>Example c) is the closest to the case that the post is talking about. When you&#x27;re trying your absolute best to maximize the power of your test, usually want to take into account what you know, or what you assume about the thing your testing. In the case of website A/B testing, you&#x27;re making an assumption (that is possibly unfounded) that reaction to A is an okay proxy for reaction to B.<p>This is an assumption - nearly all statistics is based on assumptions.

Can someone explain where my intuition is wrong?<p>1) Yes, you might find that running an A/A test on your data shows a &quot;result&quot; for one of your groups, even though there obviously is none; this (as I see it) is just due to insufficient data. Isn&#x27;t running an A/A test isomorphic (in a strong sense) to correctly checking the statistical significance of your A/B test, and only believing your A/B test if it does in fact reach a high significance threshold?<p>2) Re-randomizing your data the way they describe will inherently increase the &quot;orderedness&quot; (decrease the entropy) of you data set, which risks biasing the A and B groups in some what you don&#x27;t fully understand. It seems like the re-randomization procedure would at best leave the statistical properties of your A and B groups unaltered, and at worst introduce a new bias that makes your result fishy.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s something deeper going on here, but the post doesn&#x27;t explain it well.",1435029297

I&#x27;s sad that we&#x27;ve degraded the end-to-end principle those protocols embodied. Today, it&#x27;s not really practical to use IP protocol numbers other than 6 (TCP), 17 (UDP), and 1 (ICMP) and their IPv6 equivalents. Middleboxes, out of misplaced caution, reject packets that look unusual. We can&#x27;t even use ECN. To work around this problem, we run everything over TCP and UDP.<p>That doesn&#x27;t even work, though, because other middleboxes, working one level up the stack, reject TCP on anything but ports 80 and 433.<p>So now we run everything over multiplexed encrypted connections on one TCP port on one IP protocol. That&#x27;s just silly.<p>The low-level protocol situation is like a fossilized idiom in human language. In English, we can that something &quot;wreaks havoc&quot;, but what about &quot;wreaks happiness&quot;? Nobody understands &quot;wreaks&quot; anymore. It&#x27;s no longer a productive rule.

I don&#x27;t claim to be an expert, but I&#x27;m comfortable enough with it that I can hack on an OS kernel with C.<p>I have also learnt how to write compilers for simple languages (mostly from Appel&#x27;s book). Through reading the book, I picked up ML. At first it was an uncomfortable transition from C, but I eventually loved writing ML code. Strong typing eliminates a lot of common errors, and the compiler really feels like a friend that&#x27;s watching over you.<p>Later on, I decided to pick up Haskell. Frankly it was a lot harder to get used to it (I still can&#x27;t say I understand Haskell) because of how side effects in Haskell are made much more explicit than either C or ML. But after about a year and a half, I can now code comfortably in Haskell. And if someone let me choose a language that I can only code in for the rest of my life, it might actually just be Haskell.<p>But ML and Haskell are not without their problems.<p>C and functional languages like ML/Haskell have different problem domains. Haskell, being (almost) pure, is really good at modeling side-effect free computations.<p>The compiling process is really a translation process (thus a computation), and it&#x27;s easier to model it in Haskell. It is quite easy to mess things up in a language like C where side-effects show up everywhere, although if you&#x27;re disciplined enough you could probably translate a Haskell program into C with some modifications.<p>But Haskell/ML is definitely not for everything. I would not write a kernel in Haskell (although I do know people who have done it). With the runtime problem aside, it doesn&#x27;t give me enough control over the bare metal it&#x27;s running over (or it&#x27;s probably I just don&#x27;t know it well enough yet). I can&#x27;t layout things exactly the way I want with Haskell, but with C, I can build structs, cast integers into pointers (might not be a good idea, but sometimes necessary when you&#x27;re dealing with a kernel) and so on. With C it feels like you&#x27;re the creator, taking care of everything, hence, you have much more responsibility on your shoulder. But with Haskell, the compiler takes care a lot of things for you if you&#x27;re in the right problem domain, and it lets you focus on abstractions and the problem itself.<p>Anyway, just a little thought. I love Haskell and C equally, and they&#x27;re both absolutely wonderful languages. But try to keep yourself open and just try a little bit of new things at a time. Pretty soon you might find yourself designing compiler for your own language in Haskell (or C)!",1435028483

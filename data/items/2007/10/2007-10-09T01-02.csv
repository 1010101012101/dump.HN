65068,comment,64475,64564,0,0,cellis,,,"Hand wavy economics. I love it.<p>The fact is,people, that economics is not a science. Unlike the (more) axiomatic world of physics and math,economic principals hold true much less in the real world. Yet for some reason, people think that they can formulate theories about how economies work in certain situations. This is tantamount to trying to predict which way the wind will blow. ",1191894933

(huh?)",,"I'd like to ask PG: Is this assuming things are going fantastically well, or not so well but not so badly that we don't at least have a potential buyer?<p>Clearly the second option would result in the lower number, in which case we're basically valuing our time and sacrifice against a scheme that did ok but not great, and telling YC what we think their salvage value might be. <p>Giving a high-end 3 months upside potential is the other possibility.<p>Or should I just give a number for both?<p>Maybe I don't understand the point of this question?",1191893337

I have an open dev account and an empty application.<p>I got an official Facebook warning about one year ago for creating a group ""For every 100 people that join this group Apple will donate a laptop to a needy child."" I think it got to 250 people in an hour and then it was gone.<p>I had a middle name listed on Facebook as ""rupertmurdochsucks"" which was kind of a running joke. The only thing I can think of is that I recently contacted support about a bug that switched my class year to ""Alum."" They told me how to fix it and I did. But the CS person reported me for having a fake name, which seems really stupid, especially because they won't tell me what is going on. I also had a group that promoted Kratom, which probably goes against the facebook Terms of Use but the group co-admin didn't get banned and the group is still there.",1191893296

8996780,comment,8995173,8995173,0,0,pserwylo,,,"This is very cool indead. Reminds me of my time as an undergrad at uni, where one of our projects revolved around making a game/sim like this. Everybody else was trying to make 3D adventure games, but we were interested in &quot;good quality&quot; (I put that in quotes because I just went back to look at the code and shuddered) 2D games, that were more polished.<p>Our game was called &quot;Land of Life&quot; [0] (or Geco, according to the source code, not sure why). It was a basic, fixed size, isometric tile game. To start with, you are presented with a desert. The only thing you can do is add mountains, and then hit play and watch clouds form and move over the mountains. If you constructed your mountains well, you&#x27;d get nice oasis&#x27; with rivers flowing out of the mountains, and greenery around it. If, you probably wouldn&#x27;t get any rivers, but would get some small shrubs.<p>From memory, the only heuristics about adding mountains were: You can only make a mountain bigger if there are a certain number of mountains of a certain size adjacent to it. It was a bit like game-of-life in that way, hence the name &quot;land of life&quot;. This worked surprisingly well for constructing mountain ranges.<p>One main difference from our approach and the one linked to here is that theirs looks absolutely amazing and educational, whereas ours used heuristics that we dreamed up via trial and error.<p>[0] Screenshot (missing assets for river tiles, because I couldn&#x27;t find the final source code) - <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pserwylo/land-of-life/master/screenshot.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pserwylo/land-of-life/mast...</a><p>EDIT:<p>Here is a screencast [1]. I still think it is nice how the first river which heads off to the top right (rendered in black due to no river assets) gets surrounded by trees because it is a source of water in the desert. This is not based on any geological/ecological/climate knowledge on our part, but was still fun to tinker with.<p>[1] <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pserwylo/land-of-life/master/screencast.webm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pserwylo/land-of-life/mast...</a>",1423058288

8996748,comment,8996003,8996603,0,0,vidarh,,,"I only practice mindfulness meditation with varying frequency, sitting anything from about 5 minutes to 30 minutes, rarely longer.<p>Typically mindfulness meditation starts with basic breath meditation: Sit in a stable, comfortable position, focus on your breath and notice it going in and out. If thoughts appear, try to keep focus on the breath but don&#x27;t force the thoughts away, just try to let them dissipate without continuing them.<p>The big difference for me with unstructured relaxation was that it was <i>hard</i> at first to focus on the breath. My mind produced all kinds of objections to sitting there and paying attention.<p>Sitting for 5 minutes like that caused my mind to practically rebel. Then I went through a period with dream-like states (one of the most memorable effects, which I&#x27;ve only had a few times, was like seeing a dream unfold around me, but while dreams always feel &quot;fuzzy&quot; and unclear for me this was as if I was standing in the middle of a theatre set, seeing everything clearly, yet knowing it was not real).<p>Then I had a period of what is something referred to as &quot;monkey mind&quot; - all kinds of distractions piled on. Then I went through a period where I would suddenly get an intensely strong belief that I&#x27;d forgotten to set my alarm and was going to be late. I knew I&#x27;d set my alarm, but the feeling would become unbearable until I looked at my (set) alarm. I had to solve that by triple check the alarm before I started, and telling myself it was set, and telling myself it didn&#x27;t matter because I had lots of time free after it was set to go off, and then it stopped happening (and I don&#x27;t triple check my alarm any more).<p>These distractions were not constant, and I could sit longer and longer before they&#x27;d set in. After a few weeks of daily practice they were weakened enough that I started feeling I was getting somewhere.<p>Once I&#x27;d gotten past those distractions, it changed nature very strongly. Now I slowly sink into more and more relaxed states depending on how long I sit. At about 20 minutes I will generally start feeling as if I am noticing the pulsing of blood in my eye lids and pressure on my eyes (I have no idea if those are real physical sensations or not  - doesn&#x27;t matter to me) and see patterns similar to what you might see if you squeeze your eyes firmly shut and feel a sense of blissful calm that makes it tempting to just stay like that.<p>If I sit longer and focus, those feelings dissipates as I get calmer and more concentrated and I can best describe it as if my mind is &quot;emptying&quot; and clearing of whatever feelings the sense of bliss brought, and it feels more steady and crisp. It&#x27;s very hard to relate the sensations of it with words.<p>If I sit to the &quot;bliss&quot; state or past, I will feel an immense feeling of calm once I finish that will often last for hours afterwards.<p>I&#x27;d recommend the frequently recommended Mindfulness in Plain English (available for free online, or from Amazon etc.) or Introduction to Mindfulness (free podcasts) by Gil Fronsdal. Both are no-nonsense secular introductions and very simple, basic practice to try out and see if you like the effects.",1423057885

That will not be the case with just handing people a sugar pill and being honest about what it is. To have an effect of a sugar pill in such a setting you would have to tell people there is a chance the pill is some form of medication intended to produce similar effects.<p>The problem with that is that <i>if</i> the effects of meditation are just placebo, what you end up measuring is the strength of peoples beliefs about the efficacy of meditation vs. the efficacy of drugs - you&#x27;re not comparing like with like, and can&#x27;t rule out additive effects of combining the two (whether or not they&#x27;re both caused by the placebo effect) either.<p>And even if it is all placebo, that does not mean it may not be justified to suggest to meditate.

I think my previous comment applies here [1]:<p>I started a Math degree after 16 years of programming without any Math beyond high school (the highest being high school calculus). Most of my work as a software developer didn&#x27;t require any &quot;higher&quot; Maths.<p>Once I began studying math, including Modern Algebra, Analysis, Graph Theory, Category Theory, etc., I realized I understood many topics on an informal level, in a non-rigorous sort of way, through programming. I had a good sense of major algorithms and data structures as well as their running times. Once I did have more math under my belt, things did become easier, and I started to see connections and commonality between problems across different domains, i.e. more than one way to skin a cat.<p>Part of the reason I began studying math, is that I felt it was my limiting factor. The range of problems I could tackle as a programmer was limited by math. It turns out this was partly true.<p>The biggest misconception is that in Math there is one &quot;correct&quot; answer. This is almost never the case. Some of the most interesting solutions in Computer Science come directly from Math topics that were once considered &quot;abstract&quot;. Likewise, some of the most interesting problems are solved through approximation algorithms of seemingly intractable problems, often requiring a bit of &quot;hacking&quot; and real world experience beyond what you&#x27;d get from a formal education in Math or Computer Science.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7104566"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7104566</a>",1423056281

Stressed out, financially strained, hardly sleeping, hardly exercising, drinking too much.  I thought I was eating right but turns out I wasn&#x27;t.  I began feeling like an empty shell of my former self.  And yes, it totally affected my sex drive.  Went to doc and had blood work done.  My test levels were about 200, which would be acceptable had I been 70 years old.  I was terrified.<p>After ruling things out, the doc prescribed me Androgel, a gel-based test delivery system.  You rub it on your shoulders and it absorbs in.  But you have to be careful to not let it get on other people.  I had a baby girl on the way and sat there thinking that I never want to worry about touching my wife or daughter.  Plus this wasn&#x27;t a temporary treatment.  You are a slave to it, and pay about $10/day for it.  Oh, and it turns out people, especially younger men, have a higher chance of stroke on that stuff.  That&#x27;s no life, so I decided to try and cure it naturally.<p>And I did.  My testosterone is normal now (forget the exact number).  And I feel great.  It was simple.  First, I started strength training.  Weights, especially compound moves like squats, will build test levels.  And helps with sleep.  Check out stronglifts.com if you want a good starting point.<p>Second I fixed my diet.  Check out the book The Perfect Health Diet.  I learned I was not eating enough good fat.  I started using more olive oil, coconut, ghee (butter), and quality rumen meat.  It made a huge difference.<p>Finally I cut out the stress.  The startup ended up not succeeding but that had nothing to do with me deciding to ease up.  I&#x27;m happy I did and learned a valuable lesson that health comes first.<p>So there&#x27;s my story.

It seems that we too often forget that all of our beliefs are based on assumptions, some tested some not, some testable and some not. This means that our efforts are always asymptotically growing towards having true knowledge, as in a true justified belief. This should force some sense of humility in us, specially when dealing to others&#x27; beliefs.  Religious or not.",1423055010

8996544,comment,8995044,8995044,0,0,jasonkester,,,"I find that my best experiences tend to happen when I&#x27;m travelling alone.<p>When you&#x27;re with even one friend, you have a tendency to ignore the outside world and focus on each other.  The more people, the less interaction with the place you&#x27;re at.  Imagine the extreme example you see all the time of a dozen English friends (or Spaniards, Australians, or Israelis) on the road, loudly engaged in socializing with one another, not even interested in talking to any other travelers outside their tight group, let alone any locals.  Ask one of them for a good story from their trip, and the best they&#x27;ll be able to come up with is the one about Steve downing twelve shots and falling into the pool.<p>Go by yourself, though, and a few things happen.  First, you&#x27;re outside your comfort zone a bit more, with nobody to rely on, so experiences are a bit more intense.  Second, even as an introvert, you eventually need some form of human contact so you go into what I call &quot;emergency survival social mode&quot; where you strike up conversations with people in situations where normal you would have sat silently and finished his beer.<p>But mostly, you&#x27;re a lot more approachable when you&#x27;re alone.  That means that the locals will actually come up and <i>talk</i> to you.  I once pulled my motorbike over to the side of the road in Thailand to find a convenient bush, and when I got back to the bike, a local guy pulled up to ask if anything was wrong (in Thai).  A few minutes of awkward dictionary-assisted conversation later, I was following him back to his village, negotiating dirt footpaths on the bike on the way to have a lunch of dried fish and seaweed at his stilt house and meet his family.<p>Not a bad day, all around.  And it definitely wouldn&#x27;t have happened if there were six of us in a pack.<p>So yeah, ditch your friends for a couple weeks and go find a way to get out of your comfort zone a bit.  I bet you&#x27;ll come away with a ton of good stories!",1423054970
8996543,comment,8996003,8996273,0,0,vidarh,,,"I do power lifting (non-competitive), and while I&#x27;m noticeably muscular and lift more than most people at my gym (no competitive lifters there, so doesn&#x27;t say all that much), I&#x27;m not nearly at peak muscle <i>volume</i> nor do I look nearly as big as body builders much smaller than me - leanness makes a <i>huge</i> difference to perceived muscle size. Still, from an hour 2-4 times a week (2 times a week at the moment), with no steroids, these are some of the benefits I&#x27;ve noticed  that makes the time investment well worth it for me:<p>- More attention from people I&#x27;d want to find me attractive (and from some I don&#x27;t...). E.g. after I started lifting weights I got my first &quot;wow&quot; responses when people saw pictures of me. I also saw a massive difference in how people responded when I went out to bars/nightclubs, ranging from comments to people suddenly opting to slider their hand on my stomach or chest when they wanted to get past me instead of tapping me on the shoulder, as well as getting my butt pinched. For the first time I had a woman pick me up from a club.<p>- Being able to do a lot of movements that I&#x27;d struggle with before without thinking about it, and lifting heavy stuff, whether it is sliding that 40kg sever into rails above head height without having to get someone to help me keep it stable, or casually lifting my son up or playing with him in ways that I couldn&#x27;t have if I didn&#x27;t have the strength I do (he&#x27;s nearly 6 - he likes to climb onto my back when I&#x27;m sitting on the sofa and stand on my shoulders and jump down; people think both of us are crazy and that he&#x27;ll hurt me, but it feels nice).<p>- Far fewer situations makes me feel tired or makes my muscles feel fatigured. E.g. I sprint up stairs where I used to walk up slowly (in fact, when I first started exercising, my knees were so weak that it had started to become painful for me to walk up a single flight of stairs, at age 25, because I was sitting all day and used elevators both at work and at home).<p>- Feeling safe in a lot of situations I&#x27;d have been scared in before. Just a few weeks ago someone was assaulted near our house, and I felt safe enough to run out and confront the guy while we waited for police (I&#x27;m in the UK, guns are not a concern; I was aware of the risk of knives, though, and made sure to keep my distance until I felt sure)",1423054962

As failures occurred, customers requested more and more safeguards and testing and the cost per launch rose correspondingly.<p>SpaceX has done an awesome job, but there's a ways to go before the system is confirmed as reliable with consistently reproducible performance.<p>(For what it's worth, I think they'll do it in time, but it may cost quite a bit more yet)",1222653512

317999,comment,317948,317948,0,0,pbh101,,,"I've heard that it currently ensures that more, disparate voices will be heard.  As Jonah Goldberg once said, democracy shouldn't work such that ""51% of the country can give the other 49% a wedgie"".<p>Were the electoral model to be abandoned, it would ensure that candidates would stick to major urban areas as much as possible because they would have the largest amount of influence per unit of effort.  Now, this wouldn't hold true in all cases, but from what I understand the Electoral College as it stands helps to ensure that the sundry opinions of different interests in this country are given more consideration.<p>Interesingly, before the electoral reforms of the 1800s in Britain, seat allocations weren't decided by population, but rather influenced by the weighting of the needs of various regional trades/industries.  While this seems very anti-democratic to modern American ideals, at that time industries were much closer to the individual.  Also, I'm not so sure it was a bad idea:  you baked lobbying and the concerns of industries into the political system as opposed to grafting it on in a shadowy, behind-the-scenes system, and therefore had the ability to regulate it to some degree.",1222653346

317991,comment,317948,317948,0,0,jacobscott,,,"The easy answer is that the system for presidential elections is part of the constitution, and is quite hard to change, on purpose. You should know this if you've graduated high school (since you live in the US).<p>The second reason is that it is not clear that a ""secure, nation-wide popular vote counting system based on modern communications technology"" is a good idea even before we get to the technology. Our system of government is a type of federalism (state/national) and moving to a popular vote based electoral system weakens this division. I don't have much expertise here, but can assert with confidence that expert opinion is divided on whether or not this is desirable.",1222652581

The engineer at that firm who worked with us gave us an interesting tidbit of info about space-ready hardware. The factors of safety are engineered so tightly (e.g., FS ~=1.05) that, for a part that you've got ~$500 of materials and labor, you've got a ~$20,000 paper trail that documents every process and material source for that part. This gives new meaning to the term ""astronomical cost.""<p>The big dumb booster school of rocket design seeks to reduce this cost by using higher FS (e.g., automotive grade at FS >~ 2 or higher) and throwing away fuel.<p>I wonder: 1) How close to the BDB school the Chinese rockets are? 2) How much their vehicles cost? & 3) By how much do the differences in labor costs, hidden costs, and distributed costs confound the analysis?",1222650183

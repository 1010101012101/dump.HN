299645,comment,299451,299605,0,0,scumola,,,"kingkongrevenge - I didn't mean to sound like I replaced all of my DB functionality with flat files.  I have several stages that my data flows through (fetching, ripping, sanitizing, indexing, uploading) and I replaced the constant calls to mysql by writing things to a flat file, munging the data on-disk with the gnu tools before they get written to the database.  With large datasets, DB calls (even with good indexing) can get expensive, so I tried to avoid them as much as possible for the crawling stage of the process.  I certainly need a database for the other stages of the process.<p>A simplified example:  If I crawl a website, the chances are good that I'll pull several thousand copies of the same url from the site over and over again.  I want to insert all URLs that I find back into the database so I can can crawl them, but I don't want any dupes.  I just want to crawl the URL once and then move on.  If I insert a URL into a DB and let the DB check if it's a dupe, then I waste DB time/IO.  My solution was to crawl thousands of pages, dump all of the urls into a text file, run the text file through 'sort | uniq' and then dump those URLs into the DB and let the DB ignore the dupes at that level.   I still have to use a DB to do some of the work, but pre-processing the data up-front using 'sort | uniq' is mega-speedier in my special case.<p>Also, I did wrap most of the scripts with perl to talk to mysql and do other sanity-checking that's easier in perl than bash or tcsh.  :)",1220982771

299643,comment,299451,299609,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"Lua is semantically more similar to Scheme, according to the language designers. The resemblance is quite intentional. Ease of embedding into C is a first-priority of the language implementation. It's almost trivial to interface to C, and in many cases it's easier to write bindings to the Lua API than to massage SWIG generated interfaces.<p>""userdata"" are first-class values in Lua. They are containers for pointers to arbitrary C structures, and by overloading their behavior it's extremely easy to interface between C and Lua.<p>Lua tables are extremely elegant, and are the basis of object and class systems, all data structures, namespaces, packaging, and libraries.<p>The Lua interpreter is quite fast by itself, and with the LuaJIT written by Mike Pall your speeds can be even greater. The rumor is that the first public release of LuaJIT 2.0 is coming this winter... that one is a tracing compiler based on the same concepts as Tamarin, SpiderMonkey, and V8.",1220982742

299641,comment,299451,299451,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Congrats!<p>If you haven't yet, check out _The Unix Programming Environment_ and _The Practice of Programming_, both by Rob Pike and Brian Kernighan (K of K&R). They're concise, highly informative books about using the Unix toolset to their maximum potential. The former was written back when computers were slow and had little memory, the latter in from 1999 but very much in the same spirit. (It seems to include a lot of insights from developing Plan 9.)<p>Also, a dissenting opinion here: C's performance vs. higher level languages' development speed is not necessarily an either/or choice. Some languages (OCaml, the Chicken Scheme compiler, implementations of Common Lisp with type annotations or inference for optimizing, Haskell (under certain conditions...), others) can perform very favorably compared to C, but tend to be much, <i>much</i> easier to maintain and debug.<p>As a generalization, languages that let you pin down types are faster because they only need to determine casts once, at compile time, but if those decisions can be postponed until your program is already mostly worked out (or better still, automatically inferred and checked for internal consistency), you can keep the overall design flexible while you're experimenting with it. Win / win.<p>Also (as I note in a comment below), Python can perform quite well when the program is small amounts of Python tying together calls to its standard library, much of which (e.g. string processing) is written in heavily optimized C.<p>Alternately, you could embed Lua in your C and write the parts that don't need to be tuned (or the first draft of everything) in that.",1220982521

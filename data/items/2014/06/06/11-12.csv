They simply take advantage of the fact that the coders can&#x27;t retaliate/protest in any way.<p>* They hide the buyers history (a freelancer can see the history of a buyer only after he bids and the buyer sends him a message). Given the fact that you have a limited number of bids per type of membership this is a really nasty move.<p>* The entire site is a huge money making machine with no concern whatsoever about coder&#x27;s experience. All they care about is to make more money no matter how crappy the experience is for the coders. For e.g. they ask you money for cheating their own system (if you pay $2 your bid will be better placed than a bid of a coder with a better rating/history).<p>* They silently tolerate spam projects where buyers ask basically for free work (or they give no information about what they actually need until you place your bid). The idea is that Freelancer will get their cut no matter how a project ends (they charge both the buyer and the coder some fees). They don&#x27;t actually care if a project is finished or not as long as they get their cut.<p>* Last but not least, they offer no financial protection for both buyers/coders.",1402055271

Think about it: if he can come along and sell the tickets for a markup, why won&#x27;t the sellers sell directly to the buyers and capture that whole amount for themselves? The reason is that they want to unload the ticket quickly and with less hassle, and finding that high-bidding buyer takes more time than finding the scalper. Similarly, why doesn&#x27;t the buyer seek out a seller himself? Because it takes more time. Otherwise, both would be irrational to interact with him rather than directly.

Their release system is old and buggy, not to mention never completely overhauled, just constantly having more checks ticked on when ever a recall happens. This is actually true at Ford too, the Big 3 hold on to technology a lot longer then other companies. Ford&#x27;s time clock system is still ran on emulated System360&#x27;s using MTS a circa 1967 OS.<p>Lastly DRE&#x27;s are more of a projects internal sales arm (they <i>sell the product</i> to management. A DRE&#x27;s job is to also get the test results from the test engineer, get it to the management, take the managements complaints to the designers/hardware engineers, and relay the tests plans back to the test engineers.<p>Basically high technical middle management. Their responsibilities at some companies may involve actually writing test plans, sometimes not. I don&#x27;t believe GM does directly but somebody under the DRE does this.<p>Ultimately the DRE is just the guy who gets all the forms to all the right people so he can push the plans into the system. And takes all the responsibility when a product fails. On top of that your normally managing 5-6 products concurrently, each taking 18-72 months to clear the system. Your work load is basically endless meetings 500+ email a day, and 100+ phone calls.",1402052407

This evolution is at times deliberate, other times accidental, but all languages go through this phase - where there&#x27;s no such difficulty, insiders invent jargons and slangs to create the barrier.<p>Though now I think of it, programming languages aren&#x27;t immune from this phenomenon either!",1388174386

6972319,comment,6971127,6972206,9,0,ChuckMcM,,,"There are of course a bazillion ideas about OS design, there used to be entire conferences on them :-)<p>One of the features of UNIX was that it was designed by taking a few very simple ideas and more importantly simple constructs, and then building more complex constructs out of them. It made it possible for a handful of researchers to write all the bits of an OS needed to get to a multi-user prompt. Which at the time other examples had giant teams of engineers associated with them. That made it easy to understand at a fundamental level and you could reason about the effects various things would have on it should you make them.<p>One of my favorite books is &quot;Operating Systems Concepts&quot; which has a great survey of the features of any good operating system.<p>So is being Unix-like better? Yes if you want a simple robust operating system. No if you want a hard real-time operating system. Yes if you want a system you can flexibly add devices too. No if you want to build a security model based on capabilities. Yes if you want it to work on a small architectures with stack support. No if your processor doesn&#x27;t support stacks or the C model of frame pointers.<p>In general though understanding what an Operating system has to do is priceless for a CS person to have in their toolkit.",1388174349

Why would we choose not to believe in Race? Isn&#x27;t that promoting ignorance? Where the author suggests race is &#x27;learned&#x27; and that people are &#x27;put into boxes&#x27;, ignores that fact that chilren, having never seen people of other races, recognize the differences instantly, and ask questions as to why one person looks different than the next.<p>Rather than ignoring Races, we need to learn to celebrate race and diversity. Seeing as we have LGBT Celebrations world wide, is it likely Racial Celebrations? Apparently Singapore has a &#x27;Racial Harmony Day&#x27;, not quite the same, but maybe a step in the right direction.<p>The thing is, children know that Race is only physical and often appreciate the differences, I know I did.

I don&#x27;t think a paper that provides such a promise exists.<p>Being in the position of not having read the article my only information on it is it&#x27;s an opinion piece about education and it&#x27;s in the WSJ.<p>So I don&#x27;t expect it to be well researched, well formulated, or surprising. &quot;Oh, well, it&#x27;s an opinion&quot; -well, look: opinions are cheap enough that excellent opinions on the subject, from very intelligent people, are just given away:<p><a href=""http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/decline.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/decline.htm</a><p>And I don&#x27;t consider all opinions equal in the first place, there are various degrees of being informed, various degrees of bias.<p>I could write an opinion piece about how gutted I was to go to university and realise that by and large I&#x27;d already surpassed the curriculum in my own studies. How I went to university to be asked questions and go and find the answers, not to sit in a lecture hall listening to some toff read their powerpoint stack at us while we tried not to fall asleep. How even if you wanted to try something hard and new, (and could find something,) the fact is that university is competitive vs your other classmates, and if you try something hard and none of your classmates do - given that the courses will offer equal points (points only being given on time in the lectures and not on &#x27;hardness&#x27; - all course being scored out of 20 - thus better to take multiple easy courses and score well in them than a few hard courses and score mediocre, even if you&#x27;ve learned a lot more in the latter) then you&#x27;ll get worse grades than them.<p>... But, really, would you <i>pay</i> to hear me say that? I hope not.<p>As long as most papers are written for most people, and most people don&#x27;t put much study in to events that don&#x27;t directly impact their lives, the value of such is going to be low to me.

6972300,comment,6971025,6971995,1,0,yaddayadda,,,"I&#x27;m sorry to hear about your experience.  While there are many professors with attitudes similar to the professor you described, certainly not all professors have the same attitude.<p>For my undergraduate degree, I was lucky to go to community colleges and a small, private college.  By and large, the instructors at the community colleges <i>defaulted</i> to such an attitude, but if you had brief conversations with them and let them know what was going on in your life, they were willing to work with you.  At the community college level, I&#x27;ve heard of exceptions, but they have been extremely rare (and I come from an academic family that has ties to community college level institutions across the U.S.).  At the small, private college, professors <i>actively</i> worked with students and knew what was going in their lives.  I only met one exception, and that professor was summarily &quot;let go&quot; after only a semester.<p>At the graduate level, I&#x27;ve seen exceptionally supportive and exceptionally hostile professors.  And I&#x27;ve seen many professors who will be supportive of one or two students to the detriment of others (in the circles I come from it even has a name, the &quot;mini-me&quot;).  I had one professor who exemplified the hostile, even when I had a series of well-documented life crises and tried to work with him.  While my other professors worked with me, this individual would make no allowances - to include allowing me to miss class to have emergency surgery to prevent imminent quadriplegia.  Needless to say, my health crisis took priority.  When I returned, I notified my department chair and the graduate school dean.  While the professor was allowed to continue to treat students with a rough hand, I was given allowances to get back on track and I subsequently learned that the graduate school changed policies to prevent situations like mine from happening to other students.<p>I&#x27;ve also had the opportunity to teach several classes.  As long as the student keeps me updated and is making forward academic progress, I&#x27;ll support the student; with the one exception of teamwork.  By default, I try to limit teamwork to the bare minimum appropriate for academic purposes, and even then I have tried to work with students who are suffering from external stressors.  In graduate school, anything less than a B is tantamount to failing.  I&#x27;ve given two students grades less than a B.  In both cases, I reached out to the student many times, and made it clear that the student was doing extremely poorly, and tried to find out what was going on and what could be done to get the student across the proverbial academic finish-line.  In both cases, the students would simply tell me they had been having a hard time at home, but things had changed there, and they would be more engaged with coursework.  In both cases, this happened frequently, and there was never any increased engagement.  Denying there is a problem is denying others the opportunity to help you.<p>So, (a) please do not allow one professor to scare you away, (b) please do keep your professors up-to-date on anything that will impact your ability to meet academic goals, (c) if you don&#x27;t get acceptable support from your professors, seek help from support services (e.g., the ADA office) and move up the chain-of-command (e.g., department chair), and (d) if you&#x27;re passionate about physics, find a mentor that can help you navigate your program and move on to an appropriate graduate program!",1388174071

How much time do you also have to answer the phone when one of those people has a problem?

Instead, every single employee from Larry Page on down devotes their full time to tech support. Users are pretty sharp so they rarely have problems: they only need to call for help once per year.

I&#x27;ve gotten very good at switching between layouts, so it&#x27;s not a problem for me to switch between computers (as was mentioned as a problem in another comment) or switch layouts on the computer. To use Vim with Dvorak, the recommended solution seems to be to set Vim&#x27;s keymap so that it acts like Qwerty in normal mode and Dvorak in insert mode. Despite being able to switch between layouts regularly, switching every few seconds was too jarring for me to continue with it. If you use Vim, I would not bother with Dvorak.<p>Dvorak has a significant learning curve. It probably took me a week or so to be able to touch-type with it, and then maybe three more to touch-type effectively (but this was a long time ago! so it is likely that I am misremembering). If you are unable to commit to the lost productivity, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it. However, if you are able to spend the time, it will be a valuable investment which should make up for itself in a couple of months.",1388173831

I&#x27;ve taken it on faith that they know what they are doing, and have created libraries that are close to some nebulous notion of purity or elegance. Generally the code does something in a straightforward manner, like I could extrapolate where the unfinished parts are going (an indicator that it&#x27;s close to optimum).<p>Contrast that with corporate code, where it seems more rigorous, more institutional. It&#x27;s often entrenched in company culture and whatever process the higher ups have deemed important. I&#x27;ve written much of it off as overhyped, over-trusted and over-utilized. Some things work remarkably well for containing the chaos of an ever-changing market and workforce. But others seem archaic and I can&#x27;t believe that companies depend on the logic equivalents of toaster ovens (that unwieldiness must be a warning sign).<p>Could my intuition be wrong? Imagine an idea you have, and that instead of having to write every line, you can outsource it. And that process is hierarchical, so you can reach as high as you want to. What kind of power would that give you? What could you learn that would be out of reach to those with fewer resources? If one person can write good code, what happens when hundreds or thousands of people work for years with million-dollar budgets? Could Google or Amazon have code that runs circles around ours, like if map reduce is the low-lying fruit of the big data world, not even worth protecting? Are we locked outside the pearly gates, dealing with tools that can never give us the leverage that companies enjoy? Is an MIT or GPL license a sign that code wasn&#x27;t good enough to make the cut?<p>Or maybe the darwinian evolution of the open source world runs circles around the intelligent design of corporate think tanks.

Which is great because when someone writes some kind of code outside of Rails to work with your db, and that code has bugs, and those bugs impact data integrity, there is a hard stop at the DB layer preventing dangling/invalid references that will blow something up later.<p>A side effect of creating these explicit foreign key relationships is that any needed indices are created on both sides of the key. [UPDATE: Nope, I&#x27;m wrong, see below.]<p>Here the author has a Rails setup that fails to declare foreign key constraints when it&#x27;s making a table with relations. You can see this in the DB description of the `products` table which references the `categories` tables via a plain int called `category_id`. As a result of not having an explicit foreign key constraint this table also has no index on `category_id`.<p>So given a table with poor data integrity at the SQL/db level and lacking an index as a sympton of this problem, the author treats the symptom and advises the creation of an index on `category_id`, leaving the real problem woefully intact. And that real problem, to be clear, is the fact that the database is not being used properly but rather treated as a relatively dumb place to dump columnar data; things that Postgres gives you for free are set aside and pseudo-duplicated in Rails code.<p>Now I&#x27;m not blasting the author because I don&#x27;t know if this is a tactical issue or an issue with Rails itself. Does Rails not allow foreign key constrains in the migrations?<p>Whether this is a flaw in Rails or how it&#x27;s being used, this is a bad solution to the problem. The RDBMS is your friend, use it.

If I live in an apartment, then the landlord has access.<p>Apartments and safe deposit boxes are actually an excellent example of my point. There are legal and cultural restrictions on how a landlord or bank may access your apartment or safe deposit box. So those are protected by the 4th amendment. There are no such restrictions when it comes to data hosted in the cloud. If your landlord or your bank routinely rifled through your apartment or safe deposit box, as internet companies do with your digital accounts, then they very well might not be protected by the 4th amendment.<p>> It&#x27;s about your expectation of privacy. If you expect something to be private<p>No, it&#x27;s about &quot;reasonable&quot; expectation of privacy. And it&#x27;s about whether that expectation is objectively reasonable, not subjectively reasonable. The fact that people have access to your documents is not determinative of whether an expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable, but is a strong factor in the analysis. Your expectation of privacy is a lot more reasonable when you&#x27;re talking about an apartment, which a landlord may enter without permission only in an emergency, then when you&#x27;re talking about an online account your service provider <i>routinely</i> rifles through in order to target advertising.<p>> While the government can physically obtain such information, they are prohibited to do so by law. So it&#x27;s not a fiction, it&#x27;s the law.<p>Sure, the 4th amendment is a fiction in the sense that all law is a fiction. My point is that the boundaries of the law do not need to be coextensive with the social fiction. Just because many people treat Facebook accounts as &quot;private&quot; does not mean that doing so is objectively reasonable in light of how many people at Facebook have access to those accounts, and in light of Facebook&#x27;s data mining of those accounts. The appropriate legal standard may well be higher. E.g. expectation of privacy is only objectively reasonable when online accounts are end-to-end encrypted and not routinely data-mined.",1388173099

But some languages can prevent you from missing out corner cases in your case analysis, or from redundantly writing overspecific code that works in essentially the same way for a wide range of data types.<p>> In practice, I have even found that constructs and limitations that are intended to prevent bugs of one type can lead to bugs of some other type.<p>I have no idea what you are going on about.

For example, bounds-checked array indexing does not try to prevent programmers from using wrong array indices, it just turns what would be a segfault into an IndexOutOfRangeException.<p>> Personally, one of <i>my</i> top criteria is to choose a language with which those who will write and maintain the software (now <i>and in the future</i>) are going to be most productive.<p>I see writing buggy code as negative productivity.

I don&#x27;t know if it would solve all the problems of global state but it would definitely make serialization of the program state simple.  It wouldn&#x27;t even be that difficult to implement in a language that has a LISP-like syntax.<p>A first stab at the &quot;tree-shaped resource space&quot; referred to in the article would be the abstract syntax tree of the program itself.  Each node would have a unique URI, which can be a physical directory path on a filesystem or can be stored in a database structure.  Every local variable would be defined by a path in a flat namespace.  The &quot;parent&quot; directory of the local variable would be the function it is defined in.  Security rules can be created that simulate many of the features of variable scoping rules.  The most basic rule, that variables are only visible within the scope of their parent function simply means that the only variables that can be referenced within a function are those within the same directory.  Again, none of this seems too difficult to implement especially if your language uses a LISP syntax.<p>I&#x27;m tempted to implement a toy version of this, if for no other reason, because I&#x27;ve been wondering about good ways to serialize the program state of a DSL that I&#x27;ve been working on.

What I could do was looking at the 1000 users with the most karma. I separated those into ten chunks and looked at the total sum of Karma per chunk of 100 users. This is the result:<p>http://www.chartgo.com/share.do?id=6cca3d09aa<p>(Data: \n[ (0, 2941707),\n  (1, 1314760),\n  (2, 936226),\n  (3, 745944),\n  (4, 636533),\n  (5, 557441),\n  (6, 493996),\n  (7, 449999),\n  (8, 413963),\n  (9, 384491)]\n)<p>So as you can see the 1st chunk is pretty dominant but then it kind of flattens out.

As of 9.2 this change gets written only to the WAL directory, and you must use something like Ceph / Gluster in order to have these migration files available to each replicating server.<p>In 9.3 at some point this is slated for inclusion in the WALSender. This allows you to do full streaming replication without the requirement for a cluster filesystem to hold your binary logs.",1388170915

A lot has changed around SV/tech since then, and even more specifically, the size, culture and focus of Google appears quite different from the outside.  Google wasn&#x27;t exactly a startup in 2006, but was still closer to its roots (and only 2 years into its public status).

Given a phone number, you can determine whether or not that number is associated with a snapchat account, and you can get their username.  Seems like a pretty mild disclosure (I&#x27;m having a hard time imagining any serious abuses of this information -- someone now knows your phone number and that you&#x27;re a snapchat user, so I guess they can target some SMS spam at you if it&#x27;s somehow interesting to them to target snapchat users...shrug).  But it&#x27;s a disclosure, nonetheless, and snapchat oughta fix it.  Let&#x27;s just keep things in perspective.<p>Also, it&#x27;s laughable how wrongly GibSec estimated how long it would take to scan the entire snapchat userbase with this technique.  &quot;Let&#x27;s see, they have 8e6 users and we can scan 6666 phone numbers per minute, so we can scan their entire userbase in 8e6/(6666 x 60) = 20 hours.&quot;  Wrong: you aren&#x27;t scanning 6666 <i>users</i> per minute, you&#x27;re scanning 6666 <i>phone numbers</i> per minute, most of which are going to be misses.

9439,comment,9361,9361,0,0,Harj,,,"The very point of this article is an argument in favor of applying to YC and not against it.<p>Like it or not, all successful web companies have at some point taken on funding.  It is an inevitable part of building a company.  <p>Raising funding is a resource and time drain.  The author argues that we should all be spending time building our products.  I completely agree and that's why I applied to YC.  It's the equivalent of outsourcing your ""distractions"".  Being a YC company dramatically reduces the amount of time you have to spend finding PR and investment (things you will have to do at some point).  These things will find you.<p>The real power of YC is not the money.  It's their ability to take away most of the distractions that cause startups to fail and let you concentrate on what really matters - building your product.<p>The author shouldn't be so short sighted and should take a longer term view of building a business.",1175813661

Investors like you to be, when you're asking for that much.<p>It's ridiculous to suggest that one has a choice of focusing on funding or building a business.  Pretty nearly 100% of successful startups take outside funding, from Google on down.",1175813616

9436,comment,9361,9361,0,0,danielha,,,"There are so many failed assumptions made that this doesn't even stand as a valid opinion piece. <p>A valid point to make would have been: Accepted into the program or not, a good startup will learn from the experience and continue on.<p>Then stop there; everything else was either superfluous or unfounded.",1175812693

Please let me know if there is a more appropriate forum for this type of request.)<p>I'm an Internet business/marketing guy with a prototype. I'm looking for a hacker to be my cofounder. <p>I first heard about Y Combinator while participating in a similar program called Junto (www.juntopartners.com). As a frequent news.ycombinator reader, I've admired from a distance the work that Y Combinator participants and applicants have done. I'm looking for someone with that kind of skill set to work with me on a niche community site.<p>Part-time commitment initially, more involvement as we're able to grow the site. With regards to equity, I believe in growing the pie rather than my slice. I want a cofounder, not an employee. <p>Email me if you're interested: billallred [at] Google mail etc.",1175812537

If you are hard at work and all your rommie does is play XBox all day (no fingers at you pranav!) then it gets crazy.<p>So definitely depends on the roommate situation.<p>I'm doing this right now ... have a 1 bedroom and getting work done on the dining table! And it works great!<p>",1175812513

9429,comment,9369,9416,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"Unlike some of the other derivatives, the Lightspeed program isn't aimed at the same kind of people as YC.  I would be surprised if there are many teams well-qualified to apply for both.  Further, after meeting with a couple people from Lightspeed, I doubt it's a derivative of Y Combinator.  I think they are simply looking for ways to get in early with strong ventures.<p>(Disclaimer: I'm part of a team that applied for grant funding from Lightspeed.)",1175812342

I believe Likebetter's Bryan Kennedy added some style modifications a few weeks back.<p>Some of the YC companies have design backgrounds, and you can really tell. I'm a big fan of the Wufoo guys' design sense, especially their work for Particle Tree. As pg said in an interview: a hacker with a good sense of design is really dangerous.",1175812056
9424,comment,6668,6668,0,0,ktappe,,,"Count me as one of the (apparently) very few who had a terrible time with my startup. The one thing that I really didn't count on his how hard the government makes it. It is a REAL pain in the butt to handle all the paperwork to create an LLC and then it gets worse when tax time comes around. I tried to do it all on my own and I would NEVER do it again without hiring both a lawyer and an accountant. How one-man operations do it, with all the legal and accounting plus doing their actual jobs of running the startup is unfathomable to me.

9419,comment,9352,9352,0,0,mukund,,,"I would take a direct no, but i had had nasty experience when they go on lecturing things like ""get traction on what u are doing"", ""you dont seem to have background in this field"", ""this wont work becoz of ......"".

9418,comment,9361,9415,0,0,nostrademons,,,"PG et al. were not college students when they started ViaWeb.  Actually, I think they were significantly older than the median YC-funded founder.<p>That said, I'm a little curious about the money aspect too.  I had no problem saving up more than $15k.  I could easily self-fund my startup for a while.  I'm far more interested in YC because it brings together smart people from across the world and fosters the sort of environment you'd see in a hacker lab or math competition.",1175811572
9417,comment,9361,9412,0,0,palish,,,"That's still plenty respectable.  Woz designed most of the Apple II in his apartment while working at Hewlett Packard.  However, (if my memory serves me correctly) he left HP to put the finishing touches on the design before it launched.<p>So perhaps it might be best to leave when your product is about 80% to the point of launching, because then you can focus full time on actually getting it out the door, and on the aftermath.  If you have a day job, it might never seem like it's ready to launch.<p>But that's just my hypothesis; I don't have any actual experience with that. :)",1175811561
9416,comment,9369,9410,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"What's sad though is the majority of these applicants who actually apply and then accept these programs will probably be groups who applied for YC but were then rejected. They get whats left from the YC funding cycle. Not to say there wont be successful startups from these groups, but it kinda puts a damper on morale.<p>No thanks but I'll pass.. For us its definitely YC or nothing. Actually  we'll probably just bootstrap while we build but that just isnt the same...",1175811497
9415,comment,9361,9403,0,0,BitGeek,,,"You missed his point.   Yes, what you are doing is replicating the situation that worked for you.  And this program is probably a good one for students who are still in college and want to build a company over the summer. <p>But anyone who has left college and is working for a living should be able to save up one months living expenses every month. (EG: make 25 an hour, gross $4k, $3.6k after taxes, live on $1,500 a month or so.)   Thus if you work for 6 months as a contract programmer (or better yet as an employee for a startup) you will then have 6 months of expenses to build your business.  Thus there's no reason that not getting YC funding should be an impediment to strting a business.<p>The strong impression I get from people who post here, and the people who attented startupschool is that they are focused on getting funding.  They want to go to YC, or move to the bay area for connections to funding.  Landing a VC deal is seen as the end goal.  <p>This is not an entreprenurial focus.  Were you focused on VC funding for viaweb, or were you trying to build a business?<p>The original poster is right-- build a business-- that should be the focus.  Not getting funding.  Not worrying about what you're going to do if you don't get into YC.  YC should be seen as a possible opportunity, but not critical to success. <p>And since YC only happens twice a year and is limited in the number accepted... waiting for the next round of YC indicates that building the business or product is not the number one priority.<p>As an investor, I'd rate highly someone who was living off of their own savings to build their product-- they have shown the gumption and have even more skin in the game.",1175811144
9414,comment,9348,9348,0,0,harlune,,,"I can't work effectively from home.  To many distractions to devote large blocks of time.  I'm up in Seattle so I ended up renting out some industrial space from ActivSpace (<a href=""http://www.activspace.com/)"">http://www.activspace.com/)</a> for $250 a month.  It's not a large space but it serves my needs nicely.  Two desks, couch, fridge, white boards, and we can paint on the walls if we get bored.

9413,comment,9348,9348,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I get where you're coming from. I just recently graduated and moved into an apartment complex with fewer college kids which definitely helped as things are quieter. I think whats ideal is to work out of a small house where you can live just with your co-founders. But the issue is cost.. Renting a house is usually considerably more which will increase your burn rate.<p>I think it is pretty key to work out of the same place where you live though. Separation of living and work is not ideal for a startup, and PG even talks about this some. Your life needs to BE your work; They need to coexist. <p>As far as distractions go, I think this is another reason why living with a co-founder is so important in the early stages. Its kinda like a checks and balances. You both keep each other in check and on track.",1175811082
9412,comment,9361,9409,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Man, I feel silly now.  I have several times more than $15K saved up.  At grad-school living expenses, perhaps 3 years of runway.<p>I'm not really sticking with the day job for financial reasons though.  I want to see the product I've been working on ship.  Get it into the hands of actual paying customers.  Because I figure then I'll get to see a whole bunch of other problems that will likely impact the startup too.  Much better to make the initial mistakes on someone else's dime.<p>Problem is, my day job seems to move at a glacial pace.  So despite having a 6 month handicap and about 1/5 the number of man-hours available, my startup may launch first.  If that happens, I'll probably quit the day job whether it's done or not, because it's just a drag on the startup.",1175810876

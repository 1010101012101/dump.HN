Flirting with girls, talking with friends, etc. Making these activities digital is not changing society or improving lives.<p>That is completely wrong from my experience. By the same logic the mobile phone didn't improve anything because you could already call people on land lines (and indeed, people argued <i>exactly that</i>). E-mail didn't improve anything, rather it was damaging, because people stopped writing letters.<p>Facebook has improved my life. A lot. It has enabled (not enhanced, <i>enabled</i>) loose but very enjoyable contact with acquaintances I hadn't seen for ten years. The light-weight way of staying in touch is perfect for keeping associated with my network in my former city after I moved. I get a steady stream of pics and status updates from my sister and her kids. People I've met travelling years ago suddenly mention they're coming through my city, and we catch up, or vice versa.<p>All of these COULD be facilitated using pre-Facebook technology, but pre-Facebook experiences suggests that they didn't.",1334836637

I have used all the major IDEs, both python specific and general, and I always found they got in the way more than the time-saving features they purported to offer. I always switched back to a basic text editor (Sublime Text).<p>But then I found PyCharm and actually spent a weekend learning how to use it. It's a real pleasure to use. Intellisense stuff works very well, some of the refactoring features are excellent, and all the handy things like ctrl-enter to import things, ctrl-n/ctrl-shift-n to jump to different code in projects, really speeds up development.<p>I still use Sublime Text for short scripts, but for any major projects i use PyCharm for everything. The django support (with debugging, including template debugging) is killer.<p>Also my one interaction with the development has been excellent.

Aren't we feeling overly optimistic today?<p>With current technology (and not inventing too much new physics) interstellar travel takes so long that, in order to be an effective investment, it would require an out of this world ROI.<p>Say you can launch an expedition to the closest solar system for a billion dollars (NASA certainly can't, but we are talking privatization) and have it return to Earth in four (I want to keep my numbers round) hundred years. In order to be preferable to US Treasure bonds (generally considered a lame option, but we are thinking very long-term), our expedition would have to bring back about about 3.7 billion dollars worth of stuff.<p>The billion dollar figure and the 400 years period are both ludicrously optimistic. In order to be back in 400 years, you'd have to fly at 0.02c meaning you'd have to spend 18,000,000,000 Joules <i>per gram</i> of spacecraft for <i>each delta-v</i>. That's 72 GJ, or 20 MWh <i>per gram</i>. And that's with a 100% energy efficient propulsion system (which would require some new - and very fancy - physics anyway).",1334835963
3862459,comment,3861617,3861617,10,0,nikcub,,,"I don't like Google's import style, and I have noticed it in a lot of their code. They nicely namespace all of their packages and modules only to dump methods and classes into a single namespace when being imported and used.<p>for eg.<p><pre><code>    from sound.effects import echo
    echo.EchoFilter(input, output)
</code></pre>
What happens is that you then end up importing all of these methods and very quickly you start getting name conflicts. Lets say you want to support a third-party echo function:<p><pre><code>    from sound.effects import echo
    from vendor.soundutil.effects import echo as soundutil_echo
</code></pre>
You see this all the time in SDK and web API packages. Dozens of modules called 'auth' (which auth? twitter? facebook?) or 'oauth' or 'request'.<p>Lets say you have a user page that integrates with social networks, would you rather:<p><pre><code>    from facebook.api.auth import auth
    from twitter.api.auth import twitter_auth
</code></pre>
etc. etc. or<p><pre><code>    import facebook.api
    import twitter.api
    ..
    facebook.api.auth()
    twitter.api.auth()
</code></pre>
You end up either doing 'import as' hacks and a lot of renaming. Code is a lot clearer to read when you see full method names such as facebook.api.auth rather than just 'auth' and 'echo' everywhere. You also don't lose documentation paths.<p>My general rule of thumb is to use 'from' infrequently, never do import *, to retain the part of the path that still keeps namespacing sane and clear to the developer and as the doc says to never do relative imports.<p>It means you can scan any part of the code and understand what is going on without going back up to the top of the file. Also makes search/replace easier (rather than s/echo/echo_new s/sound.effects.echo/mynewpackage.echo)<p>The other one I didn't see mentioned is nesting levels and method lengths. Python isn't well suited to deep-nested and long methods. Especially if your coding style is to comment out blocks of code during development as you test things, you always end up commenting out parts and then having to re-indent the rest of it.<p>The same usually applies if you have long 'and' 'or' clauses in ifs that span multiple lines and make it harder to understand the code. I usually wrap those tests into separate methods (if you are using them once, you will probably use them again)<p>but for nesting, I try to stick to 2 levels max. If you go beyond that it is usually a hint that you can refactor the codepath and perhaps even separate out into another method.<p>I just happen to be doing this a few hours ago while writing an option and argument parser for a command line utility that has sub-commands. a quick re-factor made the code and all the different options and which options apply to which sub-commands a lot easier to understand<p>Edit: just further on breaking up code and bounds checking into methods, it makes life easier for other developers and for your future self. there is nothing more exhausting than trying to debug a module and finding a 3-page long method called 'run', which you end up having to break down yourself anyway. separate all the bounds checking into one or two line methods, break everything else up, document it, write some tests for it and then forget about it - that is done and it works. get on with important things.<p>checking nesting levels and method length is almost something I would want to put in a linter",1334835959

3862430,comment,3862166,3862166,6,0,mbylstra,,,"Single window mode is definitely the step in the right direction towards what I think GIMP should be doing: ripping off Photoshop wholesale. Perhaps GIMP has some features that are arguably better than Photoshop, but the problem is that a huge number of people are very used to Photoshop's interface. Just about everyone has messed about with Photoshop at some point either professionally or just for fun (be it legally or illegally) and Photoshop's interface (for better or worse) has become second nature. I would actually argue that the lack of a familiar Photoshop alternative is holding back mainstream adoption of Linux. Open Office or Libre Office are good enough replacements for most people (and they have obviously gone for the wholesale rip off tactic) but GIMP just does not suffice - the main thing being the interface, not lack of features.<p>There are really simple things that could be done like making the toolbar the same as photoshop's. I mean it's great that you can resize however you like, but having it unresizable makes it easy to remember the button layout and instinctively grab for a tool. The fact that completely different symbols are used for the same actions does not help. eg: knife is crop in GIMP and slice in photoshop.<p>Once Linux/GIMP has achieved good market share over mac/photoshop then it's time to start thinking about improving the photo/vector publishing paradigm and boy is there much remove for improvement. Adobe has pretty much had the monopoly on 2D graphic design tools for the last couple of decades. With almost no competitors - what incentive is there to truly innovate? I mean compare the sophistication of something like 3D studio max or Maya compared to illustrator. (3D being an area where stiff competition still remains) Why is Photoshop and Illustrator even two completely separate pieces of software? because they can sell two things separately for a combined total price greater than one?",1334835353

GIMP 2.8 is an intermediary step in the progress for GEGL integration (GEGL is a graph based image processing framework that will provide the core for GIMP, allowing for much advanced features). This process started with GIMP 2.6, advanced with 2.8, will be finished in 2.10. Expect the real meaty features (like high depth color channels) in the release after 2.10 (is not know if it will be labeles 2.12 or 3.0). For now GEGL is used in some UI elements and some optional filters and tools</i><p>That also answers most of your questions.",1334834172

In the first case the experts have been saying for decades (at least since the Arab oil embargo of 1973, but maybe before, since my memories don't go back farther) that the planet will soon run out of fossil fuels.  Now this is true for some definition of soon but based on what I was hearing 30 years ago I never would have expected US oil production to be growing in 2010.<p>The Solyndra case is an example of an unsuccessful business decision being based on the assumption that a resource (refined silicon) that is scarce at time t would remain scarce at time t + <a few years>.<p>Now of course hindsight is 20/20 and I'm not saying I could have predicted the development of fracking 30 years ago or Chinese improvements in silicon processing technology 5 years ago but sometimes keeping in mind some really simple ideas can help to keep perspective.  For instance when someone says natural resources are scarce so maybe we should mine asteroids I tend to think, ""... but the Earth's crust is really big, hmm..."".  Or when someone says refined silicon is really expensive so we can make a lot of money using this new technology for making solar cells, I tend to think, ""...refined silicon == sand + X, now why is X so expensive and can something be done about it, hmm, ..."".<p>I've actually often wondered why billionaires haven't invested their money in truly world changing ideas (being able to do that has always seemed to me to be the only meaningful motivation for becoming a billionaire) but there are so many technologies that could radically transform the world and human existence in the next 20-50 years that I think mining asteroids can and should wait.",1334833974

Copyright doesn't forbid actions <i>per se</i> (i.e. ""any copying"") but it does forbid <i>specific individuals</i> from performing those actions (i.e. <i>unauthorized</i> third-parties). So, assuming the JVM was subject to copyright or patents (which is more or less what they're debating in court at the moment), Sun employees could have reimplemented it a million times, either privately or publicly, but this would not have granted anyone else the right to do the same.<p>Besides, your statement that ""at no point did [Google] claim that Android was Java"" is debatable -- most developers approach Android with the belief that ""it's basically Java with some peculiarities"", and this was a large factor in its successful efforts to recruit independent developers.

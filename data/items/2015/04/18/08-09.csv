I wondered how he did footnotes in plain text, he just uses a markdown-style syntax.<p>It is an excellent approach with benefits over LaTeX. It has better separation of appearance and content, the content tends to have less visual clutter, and there are pleasant tools for distraction free writing, which I personally like. I wrote my thesis and academic papers in LaTeX, so I have used it a lot.<p>The downside (for both LaTeX and markdown) is dealing with proofing at a publisher.

9398767,comment,9396116,9397459,0,0,vram22,,,"Yes, that vi editing mode of bash is very useful. IIRC it was there in ksh too. Some people might not know that you can use both the insert/append mode and the command mode of vi(m) in that vi editing mode of bash, to edit previously entered commands. You just switch between the two modes the same way as you do in the real vi(m), with ESC to go from insert/append mode to command mode, and i or a to go from command mode to insert/append mode.<p>Also, after you have entered a previous command, to edit it, or any previous command in the history, the first thing you have to do is press ESC (to go to command mode) and then k,  thereby bring the last entered command into view for editing.<p>When editing a command, but in command mode (not insert/append mode), you can also press v to open the command in vi(m) in a temporary file, then have the full screen editor at your disposal to edit the command (useful for long scripts including for/while loops or long pipelines), and then when you save and exit (:wq or :x followed by Enter), the newly edited command gets executed by bash.<p>Also, this editing technique is useful not only for correcting typos in commands, but for modifying a previous correct command, to change some words in it and then re-issue it.",1429346960

Yet, it&#x27;s &quot;proprietary&quot; in the sense that it&#x27;s patent-encumbered. I.e. the patent holder are the proprietors.<p>VP8, OTOH, is Royalty Free with a Free Software canonical implementation and has other implementations, too, though their independence is debatable.

However it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen all the time.<p>As an aside, the distinction between double click and single click used to be much clearer (in Windows 3.1/95 times!):<p>- If its on a white background, maybe in a well, then it is a <i>selectable</i>. Click on it to select it, right mouse button to do something with it, and double-click to do the default action with it (which is bold in the context menu).<p>- If it looks like a physical button (3D and raised), then you can perform an action by clicking on it.<p>Links are a bit odd, as they look selectable (and in fact they are, by clicking and dragging from outside in), but one click performs an action. But by now, they are so ubiquotious that everybody knows that one click activates them (Well, at least one click. Two clicks do no harm in most situations.)<p>What I hate about modern flat design is that it often removes these hints towards what kind of control something is (the &quot;affordance&quot; in hip UX speak). If I click/tap on something, does it get selected, opened, or does nothing happen because it is a label? No way to know without trying.",1429346561

9398748,comment,9398691,9398691,0,0,hammerdr,,,"I don&#x27;t disagree with the premise that double clicks are a broken thing on the web. There&#x27;s too much of a cognitive shift between &quot;the web&quot; and &quot;everything else&quot; where double clicks are either a bad thing to do or a required action to complete tasks. Like the author said, even tech savvy people will double click things that they wouldn&#x27;t need to.<p>But, saying that idempotency is hard and thus we should build features to get around it.. that seems wrong to me. The web is inherently a distributed system and you&#x27;re going to have concurrent requests and weird edge cases that arise in those situations. The right way to handle that isn&#x27;t to bandaid it with disabling client side behavior. That just hides to problem. Your server is the place to handle it.[1]<p>And, it really isn&#x27;t that hard either. It&#x27;s just a couple extra validations on your input before you do a write. There are places where it is more difficult but still not overly complicated to implement.<p>[1] Dogmatism alert. Of course, there are exceptions to everything that&#x27;s a &#x27;best practice&#x27;.

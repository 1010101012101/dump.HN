I shouldn&#x27;t imply that the problem is with Project RIO, but rather with some of the unscrupulous employers who participate. The worst problem that I am aware of is that sometimes employers will illegally withhold pay, and basically the program allows unethical employers to pay below minimum or at least below market wages to parolees, force them to work overtime uncompensated, etc. The close relationship between company and parole officer puts the employer in a position to induce a lot of undue influence on a parolee-employee.<p>Anecdote/heresay: There is just such an employer in my town. They treat regular employees pretty badly, and Project RIO types, even worse. These poor guys don&#x27;t make enough to support themselves, and thus have low/no job mobility.

Some places with robust mass transit have better outcomes than others, so this is something that has to have available options to combat that in culture.<p>> Saying &quot;free would work much better if there weren&#x27;t homeless people&quot; is probably true, but that is a pretty big supposition in lots of cities.

5907414,comment,5906827,5907295,29,0,rxin,,,"Spark goes much more beyond just in-memory caching. It features a more advanced scheduler and a higher level programming abstraction.<p>The programming abstraction treats all data as collections (RDD in Spark terminology), and allow programmers to apply bulk transformation on these collections. Some examples of operations you can apply include the traditional map and reduce, the relational filter, join, outerJoin, and more advanced ones like sample. This abstraction makes it much easier to write distributed programs. As the Wired article mentioned, a distributed program written in Spark often looks identical to a single node program. This substantially reduces the amount of code one needs to write for distributed programs, and the best part is the code really expresses the algorithm (rather than cluttered with JobConf setup).<p>And the scheduler and the engine itself are aware of the general DAG of operators, so they can schedule and run those operators better. For example, if you have multiple maps, the execution gets pipelined; if you are joining two collections that are partitioned the same way, the execution avoids an expensive shuffle step.<p>There are many other benefits too. I&#x27;d encourage you to give a try. Thanks!<p>Disclaimer: I am on the Spark team at UC Berkeley.",1371667713

  vicious cycle of traffic, one that removes the incentives
  to take public transportation. The more people who choose 
  to drive to work, the worse the traffic. This raises the
  time the buses must spend in traffic, which raises the
  cost for bus companies, who raise the fares for bus
  commuters -- who are being penalized despite their own
  efforts to reduce total traffic. As the bus becomes less
  of a good deal, more people defect to cars, making things
  worse for the bus riders, who have even less incentive to
  ride the bus. (p. 167)

The author cites congestion pricing as the solution, with money raised going to pay for buses.<p>And this brings us full-circle to the argument that those buses should be free for riders. If a city charged cars to drive during congested times and subsidized bus fares with that money, this might be a solution to ease up congestion.",1371667566

After all, it&#x27;s not just the subway rider that benefits from the existence of a subway line, but all the businesses and residential developments near a subway stop too.<p>At least in Bay Area, being able to walk to public transportation (usually Bart of Caltrain: stuffwhitepeoplelike #147, &quot;public transportation that is not a bus&quot;) has a huge rent and property value premium (with property usually being valued as a rental property). Effectively this means people who would benefit most from public transit (e.g., someone who has to commute to downtown SF -- as it&#x27;s the only place hiring someone with their qualifications -- but can only afford to live in East or South Bay) can&#x27;t afford to live near it.<p>I wonder if a progressively priced tax on rent as a way to fund public transport (designed with incentives to make renting at a lower price to families attractive) would help: it would create incentives for apartment complexes to provide more affordable family units (vs. large units designed by to be shared by roommates) <i>and</i> have the effect of automatically providing more funds for public transportation to dense areas with many rentals (i.e., where it&#x27;s most needed).<p>I&#x27;d also add having states and localities fund interstates would be fair as well: there&#x27;s no reason for me to force someone living in New York to fund my commute on the US-101 (the national security reason for having interstates is pretty much dead at this point; nor does allowing a missile truck to travel require widening 280 -- a local loop from I-80 -- to six lanes) <i>and</i> it takes away the ability of federal government to bully states into passing questionable laws with a moralistic basis (e.g., raising drinking age to 21) by threatening to withhold highway funds.",1371666442

While this notion has seemed very appealing to me in the past, I&#x27;m less sure.<p>Even right now, I feel like a major problem with buses is that they really don&#x27;t need or even want customers.  Customers are a liability.  Fares don&#x27;t cover expenses.  Political capital is useful, but indirect, and bus systems have lost most customers that might provide political capital.<p>My bus system isn&#x27;t particularly bad.  The drivers are okay, but mostly they just don&#x27;t want any trouble.  The bureaucracy has smoothed out certain edges.  The buses are clean.  But the crowded bus lines stay crowded, until they get further out then they become empty and useless.  Lines don&#x27;t evolve, they aren&#x27;t adjusted, there&#x27;s no attempt to maximize ridership.  They can&#x27;t experiment with pricing; really they can&#x27;t do much of anything without approval from a political structure that doesn&#x27;t much care about buses.  Customers don&#x27;t fit into any equation.<p>Oh, and did I mention they are slow?  Buses are so terribly painfully incredible slow that only people who place very little value in their own time can justify being on a bus.  Door-to-door times on a bus range from 2x a car to 6x, often walking speed, almost never faster than biking.  But as time goes on the buses just get slower.<p>Making buses free maybe could help.  It might draw customers who actually have a way of effecting positive operational change through the political process.  It might diversify the ridership in a way that positively effects social standards of civility on buses.  I certainly wouldn&#x27;t fight it, but it&#x27;s a long shot.",1371666056

Since most people won&#x27;t make political decisions based on careful reflection, you have to have an emotional pull of some sort.

Simply accepting the phrase &quot;prisoner&#x27;s rights&quot; implies that rights can be doled out by government based on how it chooses to classify citizens. This kind of framing can work:<p><i>Political challenger, to incumbent:</i> &quot;Do you support human rights?&quot;<p><i>Incumbent:</i> &quot;Of course.&quot;<p><i>Challenger:</i> &quot;Do you consider prisoners to be human beings?&quot;<p><i>Incumbent (worried look):</i> &quot;Well...yes, though I would add that...&quot;<p><i>Challenger:</i> &quot;Then why do you support things such as prolonged solitary confinement of prisoners--which is widely agreed to be a form of torture--and the outsourcing of our justice system to race-to-the-bottom private corporations that are held to lower standards and have far less oversight?&quot;<p>The really sad part is that this is just as disingenous as the narrative supplied by the supporters of the prison industrial complex.

Some other details below:<p>1) Built with Meteor (using Coinbase API for bitcoin transfers). Loved it, especially as a noobish web developer, but not without its challenges. Some examples: no server-side URL routing/static page model in the official packages, had some trouble with HTTP calls/callbacks, and I sincerely hope no one ever sees the horrible mess that is my home-spun single-application Twitter OAuth implementation. Most of these issues will probably resolve themselves as Meteor/I grow.<p>2) The lofty goal behind Bitbanter: reduce barriers between (potentially anonymous) satirists and consumers while forgoing the traditional data collection/ad model. Besides the data a user voluntarily submits, zero data collection goes on (even bitcoin amounts come straight from the blockchain). I&#x27;m not 100% opposed to Big Data, but to me there&#x27;s a strong philosophical argument for unbundling content from advertising and trying something &quot;pure.&quot;<p>3) The less lofty goal behind Bitbanter: I love making people laugh, and wanted a place to showcase and scale my satire. But blogs are boring, so I made this instead.<p>4) Yes, I&#x27;m aware that at scale there are some huge problems with the way articles are promoted (e.g. spam, someone with big pockets could push an article to the top and my whole anti-bundling-ads argument goes to shit). Still thinking through those issues, but figured they wouldn&#x27;t matter as long as the site was tiny.<p>5) I know bitcoin elicits mixed feelings, but man, it&#x27;s cool. Without bitcoin, it would have been much, much more difficult (I think impossible, but I have a small mind) to build a platform where people can post things anonymously and get value from others seamlessly (another example: reddit&#x27;s bitcoin tipper bot). Even if this f(l)ails, I&#x27;m pretty excited about bitcoin&#x27;s future. If nothing else, I hope my experiment gets the HN gears turning.

Due to the requirement that you need to be a resident of this city, 10000 more people have &quot;migrated&quot; to Tallinn from other cities, now paying taxes here, and adding a predicted 9 million in tax revenue for Tallinn.<p>Personally I love it of course. I use it in ways that others might deem &quot;uneconomically&quot; i.e. take the tram for 2 stops instead of walking 15 minutes, but I also notice I travel further distance more often, exploring the city, because I don&#x27;t feel annoyed with having to either find parking space, or pay a taxi, or pay a bus fare.",1371664894

If a bus started in downtown and went elsewhere, riders had to pay as they left the bus. Seattle still doesn&#x27;t allow you to pay at any door on a bus, only at the front with the driver. A crowded bus meant people could not easily get to the front; either the bus sat while people squeezed down the length of the bus, or they simply got off at the rear and didn&#x27;t pay.<p>An alternative solution, of course, is to incentivize use of RFID bus passes (already in heavy use), install RFID readers at all doors, and speed up boarding all-around.",1371664892

5907103,comment,5906536,5906976,2,0,RyanZAG,,,"Agreed there - maybe a possible option would be to flag a specific port as being non-BSD sockets? So when the kernel reads the port, some short circuit logic could trigger and dump out to a different socket implementation? That would allow legacy to run fine, and then let apps trigger a special flag when binding a socket to allow for direct access. The routing part of tcp/ip happens before BSD sockets are hit, so this should do an end-run around the BSD socket overhead.<p>Then you could have your system running as normal, but allowing your http server special access to network i/o. Any kernel hackers around who can comment?",1371664870

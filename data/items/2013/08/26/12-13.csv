In discussing destructive functions, Graham describes the ways in which they can be used with reasonable safety - e.g. immediately mutating a list newly created by a mapping function.<p>The reasons one might do so in Clojure are likely to bear similarity to those provided by Graham - speed and memory - despite the vastly greater resources of today&#x27;s computers versus those of 1991.",1377521995

In some cases the children have almost-daily communication with their birth parents. Our home, and our embrace, is simply a vessel for them whilst their real home gets back on its feet. There&#x27;s no animosity or judgement. The kids just need removing from a toxic environment for a length of time, usually under 6 months, so their parents - not them - can rehabilitate, back to the standard required by the local authority.<p>To say &quot;That&#x27;s the way parenting works&quot; is kind of unfair, because in the example I gave we are <i>not</i> these children&#x27;s parents and we&#x27;re not a replacement for them. In fact, the term &#x27;foster parent&#x27; is rarely used anymore.<p>A better example would be if my child had a friend over for dinner. I will treat that child with respect and warmth, and whilst they are in my home their safety and well-being are my responsibilities. My child is very &#x27;web savvy&#x27;, but I have no idea what kinds of influence another child can have, so I need to be cautious.

Two, it might take years to become conversational in a language, but probably only a handful of months to get good enough to do the daily shopping. Three...what everyone else has said: if you know English, there are very few places in the world where you&#x27;ll ever be completely unable to communicate with <i>someone</i>.<p>> <i>3) A lot of us have family support systems that aren&#x27;t easy to give up</i><p>Yeah, I understand completely ;-)...<p>My mother was born in the same house in Switzerland where my grandfather and his brothers and sisters grew up.

Time zones differences are the hardest to manage, but still doable (<a href=""http://everytimezone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everytimezone.com/</a> helps, even though they <i>still</i> don&#x27;t have my time zone).<p>I don&#x27;t like that I now feel like I <i>had</i> to leave, though I am very glad that I did leave.<p>Living in another country, even if only temporarily, is something I would recommend to anyone in any country. A friend is currently living abroad for a year with his two school-age kids, and he seems to be having a blast so far. It will certainly improve your ability to gain perspective.

Besides just being creepy, there are people who have been sexually assaulted and this amounts to an additional assault, and can be emotionally damaging.

Nobody even bothered to do a study to find out, or even do basic safety checks, before they installed them.

Others think that government is the root of all evil, while corporations are either forced to cooperate or willingly abuse this system, because if they don&#x27;t, then competitors will surely do it. Thus the latter group believes that businesses simply respond to incentives.<p>Thus it is no surprise that the first group of people usually believes we need more elaborate regulations and a good government.

6276505,comment,6262574,6263873,1,0,joeldidit,,,"Managers are a necessary component of any sizable enough team, sure. The problem these days is that middle management doesn&#x27;t really do it&#x27;s job, and instead does the opposite by imposing their will and by getting in the way as they fight to maintain territory and climb the ladder themselves. It only takes a short while before middle management becomes this corrupt and worthless layer, especially if you hire them from the outside (already corrupted). Middle management also tends to suck due to lack of training and due to conversion from an individual contributor to manager being seen as a promotion and a path to executive leadership. The skills required of a manager and those required of someone in an individual contributor role are usually very different, and also the skills required of an exec are different from those required of a manager, so what&#x27;s present are three separate paths that should be prepared for and climbed separately, but that often gets lumped together.<p>Better training would yield better middle management, so would a breaking out of this long held notion of territory and holding your employees down. I&#x27;m almost convinced that all managers care about are climbing the ladder, holding their employees back (to not lose them, to not have to deal with a threat of someone better, and to be able to take credit for everything the employee produces), buffering against lawsuits, and protecting their territory. That&#x27;s it.<p>Sure there are some common threads among all career paths, but that is to be expected. The problem is that the individual contributor to middle manager role change isn&#x27;t a promotion but a career change, and so is the change from middle manager to executive.<p>It&#x27;s also a shame, because by the time most individual contributors are done climbing through the middle management ranks whatever energy, passion, naive ambition, and leadership ability they had is probably long gone (beaten out of them), and what&#x27;s left is nothing more than the same old thing. This is especially bad if they also had grand visions of what the future could be, but by the time they are done climbing the ranks, they are just another bean counter looking for the next headcount trimming and for a way to meet this quarter&#x27;s goals at the expense of the long term.<p>It&#x27;s always easy to tell what happened to the good players that got beaten down while climbing the ranks, because the originally corrupted will play that good guy&#x27;s misfortune as though it happened to them. They just love taking what they&#x27;ve done to other people, then playing it back as though it happened to them, not other people. Just listen to the excuses and &quot;sob stories&quot; of a corrupted management, and you&#x27;ll get a good idea of what they&#x27;ll do to you if you enter the race with any form of talent, potential, or ambition.<p>There should be a path for those that want to remain individual contributors, for those that want to be middle managers, and for those that want to end up in a leadership/executive role straight out of school. I understand the lack of incentives that a split among these roles would create (who would want to just be a middle manager with no path to senior leadership?), but that&#x27;s something to be worked through. Someone can leave the individual contributor ladder and begin on any of the other ladders, but they should understand that this is a career/direction change and not a promotion. This animal needs to be turned on it&#x27;s head.<p>And since there isn&#x27;t one, anyone becoming a manager against their will, or as a stepping stone to executive leadership, needs to keep in mind and constantly remind themselves of what their true ambitions are, because if they don&#x27;t, then after 8 or so years in middle management, they&#x27;ll become absolutely worthless and probably corrupt. They also have to fight to hold on to their ability to craft a cohesive vision and making it happen, instead of mismanaging the ambition/vision of their superiors, because otherwise, they&#x27;ll be ass out pulling the same dubious shit other worthless executives pull, and they&#x27;ll be beating down star employees (to protect their own skin), rather than creating an environment in which they can get out of the way, and let those employees flourish.",1377519324

A few rooms had their walls entirely covered in miniature Mickeys, giving the place an eerie and deeply melancholic atmosphere.<p>The point of my post is that it feels really great that France and Germany are now allies, maybe even friends. You can criticize Europe a lot but at least we aren&#x27;t fighting each other and hopefully won&#x27;t do so for another century. Whenever I see Americans complaining about their country turning to shit I want to tell them to focus on the fact that it could have been so much worse.",1377518691

Did you make such a fuss when you were wanded? Did you make a fuss when you were carded (at the bar, or at the airport?)<p>I think we should protest when the TSA is unprofessional and does not monitor their people and they do unprofessional things, (like circulate photos or make fun of people) but protesting the scanners themselves is like going to a hospital and refusing an MRI because hospital staff may act unprofessional and look into your medical records.<p>The scanners are a detection technology. They are the next generation metal detectors as are the &quot;sniffers&quot;. At some point people will &quot;hack&quot; them, just like metal detectors are useless now and we will need the next thing, but they are just a technology.",1377518595

6276459,comment,6275479,6275876,1,0,mbenjaminsmith,,,"Question:<p>How can algorithms with an adjustable work factor be better or worse than each other?<p>Answer:<p>They can&#x27;t be. They each provide an arbitrary amount of work (or entropy if you want to look at it that way) to a non-ideal key (e.g. a password).<p>Moreover, any discussion of &#x27;how much is enough&#x27; is a guess. How powerful the system used to brute force your keys will be is unknown.<p>I&#x27;ve read things like &#x27;adjust it until it takes 0.5 seconds on your computer&#x27;. That makes sense <i>if and only if</i> your key can only be attacked on that same machine, which is probably seldom the case.<p>The rule of thumb is that it should be as expensive as you can make it (weighing user experience, operating costs, etc) and that more is better than less. There is no definite level of security provided by these algorithms (or families of) and their relative value can&#x27;t be easily compared.<p>Scrypt is an exception as it can use an arbitrary amount of memory, which adds a dimension to the cost added.<p>Having said that, unless you&#x27;re actually using these for what they were intended (deriving keys) and encrypting something then you&#x27;re probably adding little actual security to your users&#x27; lives.<p>I would consider this topic firmly in the realm of security theater. There&#x27;s entirely too much handwringing about hashing passwords and entirely too little about encrypting user information or providing anonymity (where appropriate).<p>I think we&#x27;d all be better off putting notices on signup pages that say &quot;please don&#x27;t reuse passwords&quot; and spending more time on other more important security issues.<p>Better, where we can we should move to zero-knowledge, bad-password tolerant protocols like SRP and bypass this issue entirely.",1377518506

Instead of having blockable ads surrounding your content, you subtly twist the content into being an ad of sorts. Ad blocking has helped fuel this and while it can be done well, it can also be done in a shady payola-esque way.. while being far harder to detect or block than regular ads.<p>Blocking ads is about as effective as banning abortions long-term. There&#x27;s a non-shifting demand and it&#x27;ll always find a way to express itself, whether in entirely legal ways or not.",1377518484

The system encourages this 'number juicing' through whatever means.<p>During the course of a class, if as much education is given to each individual possible, then at the end of the class what does the actual grade matter?  These grades turn out to be a poor proxy for things like earning, ingenuity, creativity, changing-the-world, or for that matter even grokking the materials.  The only thing for which they're (maybe) a valuable proxy is 'how well can this student juice the grade of the next course in the line' -- a question whose answer ultimately adds no value to society.",1366923564

The USGS document you link, for example, estimates (before this discovery) 38,000 tons of domestic reserves, but that is with a conservative definition of reserves that includes only those considered feasible to extract with current technology and market conditions. The <i>total</i> domestic reserves of lithium deposits known to exist were closer to 400,000 tons, from what I can find, i.e. only about 10% of domestic reserves are considered feasible to extract. How much of an impact this discovery has will depend on what proportion of that 228,000 tons ends up in each category.",1366923498

This article touches on this idea (""... at least four genetically distinct breast cancers...."") but even this is a <i>gross</i> underestimation of the complexity of cancers.<p>Essentially, the only thing that unites cancers together is that they represent a class of diseases in which your own cells multiply in an uncontrolled manner. Beyond this idea of ""out of control growth"", there are a number of common ways which these distinct phenotypes occurs (such as too much of pro-growth molecules, not enough ""slow down"" molecules etc)  but genetically/molecularly there are many, <i>many</i> different routes which these phenotypes can be achieved.<p>This, again, is still only touching on the surface. After you have the molecular underpinnings of the ""out of controlness"", you have genetic and non-genetic factors relating to things like where the tumour is, how do the cells change once the cancer begins to progress, how your body reacts to the cancer, how your body reacts to drugs etc.<p>In 100 years time, I'm confident we'll look back on our present day way of thinking about cancer in the same way people now look back at our previous ideas relating to mental illness 200 years ago, or general diseases 500 years ago.",1366923338

5609799,comment,5609445,5609445,11,0,billiam,,,"The most important implication of this discovery is that while the price of lithium could plunge, decreasing the costs of lithium vehicle batteries, unless we put a system in place that uses regulatory and market forces to guarantee that this lithium is recovered and recycled, we will have a huge environmental problem on our hands. Disposal and sequestering of lithium metal is a significant part of the overall cost of an EV-focused transport system.  Global demand by 2020 is projected by USGS to be about 300,000 tons a year, so the effect of this single discovery might not be that large; the major advantage is preventing China from exercising monopoly power on Li production.  But I am confident that many more discoveries are out there (I used to be a geologist and worked around Silver Peak in the past), so I think the time is now to start figuring out how to avoid taking all that Li in brine and spreading it throughout our waste stream.",1366923305

My opinion: lose weight. Or rather, reduce your body fat percentage. It's not as hard as people make it out to be. Look at the hot or not composite index. Notice the correlation? The numbers are inversely correlated with their body fat percentage. If you are wearing great new clothes, are clean, are groomed, and are 30+ pounds overweight, you're going to look less attractive (and therefore less successful and trustworthy) to most people than someone who is wearing average clothes and is in decent shape. And I'm not talking about see-your-abs shape, though of course that's even better. I mean just getting to a healthy weight.

I was kind of sloppy, and used society as kind of a shorthand for the type of emergence you describe. In fact, I would go as far to say that a given society is the very type of emergent phenomena that you describe, and exists as a kind of a high (perhaps highest?) level system that we tend to exist and work within.<p>Regarding the second point, I really tried to cover this angle with my little bit about 'goodness' of a system, and also vastly over simplified things. Obviously different people in a system are effected by it to different extents, and can play vastly different roles. Many of the statements I was making were with regard to systems with all members are on roughly the same footing. Imagine an honour system for paying for soda, an agreement that everyone on a street clears their own segment of sidewalk of snow, that type of thing. My assumption was that systems and agreements where everyone is more or less on the same footing are generally beneficial to everyone.<p>Obviously, the situation with regards to taxis and Uber is different. The majority of people are just consumers. They don't really care as long as they are provided the same benefit (reasonably priced, safe, quick, point to point transport). The taxi companies on the other hand are in a completely different position, and in fact, from their position, Uber is definitely a cheating parasite, and a net negative for the taxi companies. I think this falls under my lazy little blurb regarding 'breaking bad systems'.",1366922647

That requires that there are people follow strategy #A of wanting to punish cheaters rather than strategy #B of not punishing cheaters.  (From the point of view of someone following #A, someone following #B is cheating, since they are a free rider off of the efforts of people like you.)<p>The problem is that strategy #A is costly.  But following it is more tenable if other people who follow the same strategy actively reward people who demonstrate that they follow strategy #A by outing cheaters.  However when people who follow strategy #A become either too common (there are not enough cheaters to catch to reward the vigilance) or too rare (you're overwhelmed by cheaters), then #A becomes not worthwhile, which increases the prevalence of cheating.  This proceeds until either there are enough cheaters that vigilance is worthwhile, or until that rule breaks down entirely.<p>Therefore you can only observe #1 (rule following) being a successful strategy when there are people around following #A (moral outrage at cheating).<p>In real life people switch between these strategies depending on the rule.  For example I get morally outraged at people who cheat in school.  I cheat on the speed limit (but within the limits that I think the police will accept).<p>However when you compare societies, you can clearly see that ones which discourage cheating, have far, far better outcomes than ones that broadly accept it.<p>In that note, my brother made a recent observation that I like.  He's lived both in the USA and in China, and has dealt with people at various levels of society in both countries.  His observation is that the broad mass of Americans tend to be relatively moral, but the people at the top in the USA tend to be corrupt.  But China is reversed - the average citizen will gladly cheat you if they can, yet the people at the top genuinely want to do what they think is best for the country.  (Note, my brother got to personally know many people who are highly placed in the Chinese government while he worked at Lovells and was putting together the Sino-Global Legal Alliance.  His opinion of their characters is based on personal interaction, not media accounts.)  His personal opinion is that this is going to be a net positive for China going forward.",1366922419

I dread ever having to deal with a company outside of basic transactions.<p>I used to think this was due to some sort of societal shift towards being people being more dick-ish and self-absorbed, but now I think it is just a case of efficiency run amok.<p>In order for companies to be efficient they define very narrow roles for employees, define a narrow set of likely interactions, and train only for dealing with those and then eventually base performance metrics off of only that narrowly defined set of predefined actions.  When something even slightly out of the ordinary occurs, nobody is incentivized or authorized to take steps off the playbook to make things right.  So you end up with massive gridlock where the employees can't really help you so they stall and redirect, which is probably almost as frustrating for them (I'm assuming here, I don't work in customer service) as it is for us.<p>Even the modern companies lauded for their great customer service like Amazon or Apple pretty much fit into this ""pre-defined interactions"" model but side-step some of the bigger problems by just having a very liberal ""okay, we'll swap it for you with no questions asked"" policy, which is still just a mostly automatic process and in some cases doesn't actually fix the real problems, but at least it is a policy under which the customer makes out better than in the usual case of being sent on a wild-goose chase of contacts only to eventually smash into a brick wall.",1366921621

I have a number of thoughts on your arguments.<p>Society doesn't set up rules and systems, they seem to emerge as a consequence of beneficial cooperative behavior towards a 'goal'.  When it's no longer beneficial to cooperate towards a goal, over say other strategies like cheating, the rules are overlooked, passed, or changed as quickly as they emerged.  The prevalence of War as a way to 'rebalance' resources comes to mind immediately, but so too does the reality that only 2% of people pay use taxes.<p>To your point about parasitism.  Human societies are always in a state of change with respect to sociological and technological concerns, and the success of a society in achieving its 'goals' seems largely dependent on how well it adapts to this change.  The parasitism you've described seems to be more a reality of economics than society in general, and though your point seems valid on its face, You wouldn't say that the success companies like Uber, which are cheating parasites by your definition, is really a net negative for the society.<p>to your point about morality.  I believe morality is really orthogonal to this issue and should be considered from different viewpoints in different contexts because humans can hold contradictory points of view and still remain 'functioning'. History holds many examples of individuals who challenge what is 'moral' in a society through cheating, and they are sometimes lauded, sometimes not.  I think of the narrative surrounding Rosa Parks on one side ( in support of cheating ) and the story of Cincinnatus ( in support of not cheating ) when considering morality in the context of the cooperation cheating dichotomy.<p>and you're right, this is a very interesting topic, definitely outside the scope of this small classroom experiment.",1366921504

Open spaces such as a living room are perfect for omnidirectional lighting.<p>Indeed when I have lived in places with track lighting the annoying part was always trying to spread the light out enough to make it seem omnidirectional without having a bunch of bright hot spots around the room.<p>When I am cooking or something, sure, light up my working surfaces, but for general ambiance when I am at home I want the entire bloody room I am in lit up!<p>Now just do that while saving power. :)<p>Indeed, if you look at how recessed lighting is installed (and I'll be the first to point out that recessed lighting is generally stupid), there are a ton of cans installed in a grid throughout the ceiling to provide what is essentially uniform brightness in a room.",1366921403

It would be possible, but not easy, for a very well prepared student to do the research and figure it out (or at least write an intelligent answer) in an hour.  Some bright students who haven't studied much probably would be able to research quickly and come up with a good answer, especially if they split up the task.

Go is what a colleague calls ""being stupid simple"", which is really its strongest asset at this point. It eschews a lot of complexity by not trying to be clever.<p>The problem with Go's pointers is that no thought has gone into thinking about goroutines as boundaries of data ownership. It's simple to share mutable data between goroutines, and it's impossible to verify (manually or by any kind of analysis) that a program is not a shared-everything pile of spaghetti. This, plus mutable data, makes it impossible to safely implement things like Erlang-style remote task spawning.<p>What I would like in my ideal language is a single pointer type: A pointer into the task heap. However, pointers may only be shared between tasks by copying or by transfering ownership, except for immutable data, which can be shared freely with no overhead other than normal GC/refcounting. With some COW magic you could even make the copying really fast, too. Then all you need is a simple syntax for limited references that cannot be stored, only copied, so that you can actually have functions that work on data efficiently without leaking their pointers anywhere.<p>Maybe I am being naive -- I won't pretend to be a Rust expert. But this model works pretty well for Erlang. I find that while Rust is clever, it falls into the other extreme and becomes <i>too</i> clever; and being too clever is a kind of stupidity. For example, borrowed pointers sound neat on paper, but then you find you have to dick around with declaring pointer lifetimes. That's pretty insane. It results in a kind of syntax that represents everything I hate C++ for. I can understand that it took a while to decide on a syntax for declaring lifetimes. It looks totally weird and arbitrary. (Quotes are for strings, man!)<p>It's also possible that Rust just is not for me. :-)",1366920267

One of you will need to participate in this dialogue and you have to require that your new firms does great documentation (to the point that all three of you understand).<p>This will not be inexpensive and finding an individual to hire will require more than a stake in your company in a small salary. You may want to consider a reasonable or slightly above stake and an average salary. You're asking a lot of any individual to come into a situation and repair it. At this point, you need this person more than they need you. There are a lot of executive decisions to be made but it goes with the territory of a startup.<p>You face two huge challenges outside of the dispute with your outsource firm. Hiring a capable individual that can do all that you are requesting now and in the future. Convincing a VC firm that this is not a huge problem.<p>Good Luck",1366920026

The reason is that linux computers, even ones running ""popular distros"" such as Ubuntu, are considerably more prone to interoperability foibles and installation/updating problems.<p>The reason popularity matters, even though I have the technical skill to administer any OS competently, is that popularity is the single best incentive to encourage third parties to iron out the kinks on a particular platform. The reason AMD drivers work better on Windows than they do on Linux is not because Windows is ""better"" by any of the metrics of quality you espouse, it's because Windows is more popular. The reason Steam for Linux is only supported on Ubuntu is not because Ubuntu is ""better"" it is because it's the most popular distro. The reason to use popular platforms is because all of the little things that require a half-hour of expert time to work around would have already been solved by the vendor who recognized that such issues are worth testing for and fixing for a platform with 100 million users, but not for one with 20,000. That's distasteful to some because it doesn't seem meritocratic and it's out of the control of the creators of the OS, but it's a fact of business, and it does affect the quality of an OS in tangible ways.<p>As for the ""expert"" thing, the costs really aren't that different for various kinds of users. The reason I care about this stuff is because the opportunity cost of my time spent solving menial issues that would have been solved by the vendor if I were on a more popular platform is too high. The reason my mother cares about this stuff is because the transaction costs of finding someone who will spend the time to figure out what's going on and fix her computer is too high.",1366920007

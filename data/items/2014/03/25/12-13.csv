7465527,comment,7464861,7465396,2,0,ndeine,,,"Yeah, you&#x27;d have to rig up your own charger (if you wanted to make it easy to charge) and USB power output manually, and then make those things effortlessly portable.<p>I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with Li-Ion batteries and more advanced chemistries, and I have to say I&#x27;d be scared to try rigging up something that can handle the kind of amps the Reactor is promising.<p>The only lithium-ion-like batteries I know of that can handle any sort of reasonable amp draws (100W at 5-20V = 5-20A currents) are e.g. really modern LiMn2O4 (hybrid? I&#x27;m not sure) cells like [1], not standard LiFePO4 or whatever. So if they happen to have really nice high-draw cells in them, with protection circuitry added to each and all the stuff to make it safe, then they&#x27;re definitely in the right value range. Keeping batteries from failing dramatically and exploding when subject to abuse, electrical or otherwise, is not trivial.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://illuminationsupply.com/batteries-c-48_50/18650-sony-us18650vtc5-2600mah-high-discharge-flat-top-p-966.html?zenid=8fb99c288b25eb2d416e3f6dde58ec7e#.UzF7iEUoGCh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://illuminationsupply.com/batteries-c-48_50/18650-sony-u...</a>",1395752385

Not the same as Java, but still many people would probably ask the same thing about C# as you&#x27;ve asked about Java: How often would you read stdin in C#? I use it at various prototyping stages of my applications. Oh, I need to handle a new file format. Ok, write the parser and classes to contain the file contents. Then create a quick console app that lets me read in a file and pose questions to it (give me the contents of data block 0x0840, what&#x27;s its time tag, etc.). Now I need to run analyses on the file, and there&#x27;s another file format that contains the queries. Create a quick console app that lets me combine those two pieces and a simple text interface to explore it. Then, once the pieces work, I plug them into the GUI. Now, do I do this every week? No, because after a certain point it&#x27;s all about the GUI and other interactions. But it&#x27;s a great way (for me) to prototype, and I&#x27;d use this approach regardless of the language for most programming tasks.",1395752291

I&#x27;m tempted to buy it myself, but given the synopsis, I&#x27;m a little skeptical.<p>&quot;The researchers have now shown that a brute force attack on the WPA2 password is possible and that it can be exploited, although the time taken to break into a system rises with longer and longer passwords.&quot;<p>A brute force attack is possible on any symmetric encryption system. Difficulty is increased with the size of the keyspace. These are truisms. No offence to the authors, but this isn&#x27;t really a discovery, unless they&#x27;ve discovered a way to reduce the key space.<p>&quot;As part of their purported security protocols routers using WPA2 must reconnect and re-authenticate devices periodically and share a new key each time. The team points out that the de-authentication step essentially leaves a backdoor unlocked albeit temporarily. &quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t really a backdoor. If there was an actual fault that would allow you to authenticate without passing a key, that would be one thing. But you still have to pass a key by the way they describe it.  To perform a brute force attack on the authentication step, you need to capture the handshake. You can wait for that to happen, or try and force one yourself. Here&#x27;s an aircrack tutorial on how to do this:<p><a href=""http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=cracking_wpa&DokuWiki=479b5790be5aafa747b4d827573abbf0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=cracking_wpa&DokuWiki...</a><p>Note though, that while this gets you the packets needed to perform your attack on (as opposed to waiting for the Client/AP to periodically reauthenticate), and potentially saved you a couple of hours, you still have to break the key.<p>And that&#x27;s what it all comes down to. Breaking a weak password is easy. Breaking a lengthy key is hard. The only vulnerability that exists as described so far is insufficiently long keys. That&#x27;s a key management/user problem, not so much a technological one.",1395750850

Employer-employee relationships are business transactions.<p>A good husband/wife shares rewards fairly equally. An employer rarely distributes profit equally.<p>A good husband/wife team both have a large degree of autonomy and decision making power. In an employee-employer relationship this power predominantly resides with the employer.<p>A good husband/wife stands by their partner in times of trouble. An employer will happily jettison under-performing employees.<p>A good husband/wife will sacrifice some level of material comfort in order to help their partner improve themselves. Employers will not provide training etc unless it is in their best short term interests.<p>Etc etc etc. Fact is jobs are nothing like marriage.<p>Likewise it is not about advertising in unwelcome places. Google is not advertising to Apple; they are advertising to individuals who happen to work at Apple. The party, Apple, that considers it unwelcome is a <i>third party</i> to the advertising. It is frankly none of their business. It is unwelcome to Apple <i>because</i> it stops them from underpaying their staff.<p>And finally there is a big difference between actions that enhance the market and allow it to operate efficiently and negative market actions. If you are worth $200,000 to Apple but only $100,000 to Google then it is a better allocation of capital for you to work at Apple. If you are worth that money to Google then they can easily counter offer. This aids market efficiency which is the driver of all our economic growth.<p>This is completely different from trying to steal key players simply to harm your competition. But stopping this key player theft is actually easy via legal and ethical market mechanisms (e.g. vesting options, bonuses on successful completion of key deliverables, fully funded non-competes, actually paying market wages etc).",1395750438

Just to fill in the details (and because the alternative is for me to start responding to work emails which I just don&#x27;t feel like doing this morning): Babbage was concerned about the quality of mathmatical table books, which were used for calculations before we had modern calculators and slide rules weren&#x27;t mainstream. The figures in them were computed by hand, and some were so bad there was an error on every page, which made them useless for scientific work and dangerous for industrial work. The Difference Engine was designed to print out pages of figures using a little printer attachment.<p>ENIAC was ininitially put to work calculating artillery trajectories, once the programmers figured out the bug where the shell kept going after it hit the ground (oops!).",1395748891

And therefore does not allow you to suddenly move objects from one place to another.<p>What it does allow for is the synchronization of random data between two places faster than light.  So two receivers can securely find themselves in the possession of a shared encryption key, that can then allow them to send information in a way that intermediates can&#x27;t intercept.",1395748872

Continued support means that you can keep using that OS and your software will very likely continue running on the OS without problems, and if there is something broken by a patch, then you can go and complain to them.<p>If your software runs on Ubuntu 7.04, you suddenly upgrade to 13.10 and your software stops working, then I don&#x27;t think Canonical will take any responsibility or help you.<p>I know MS is not perfect in this either, and SP2 introduced quite significant changes, but fundamentally it&#x27;s the same OS, same look, same UI paradigms, etc.; and they at least intended to keep themselves to the rules described above.",1395748810

The Extjs framework, as one example, lets you back through almost all the navigation including flipping between dynamic tabs.  I'm not even sure how they've implemented that.<p>There was a Ajax chat application that was posted here recently.  And this was my comment: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1128206"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1128206</a><p>The back button is an extremely useful feature and should probably be in every application.

You could probably build something very useful quite quickly.<p>I think political campaigning is ripe for cool startups.  I have an idea that I've dubbed ""Pressure"", which would be sort of a hierarchical, goal-setting and -rewarding online campaign management tool.<p>Basic premise: any sort of campaign, to be successful, must bring pressure on a variety of fronts - in traditional media by way of letters to the editor, calls to talk shows, etc.; online through blog posts, social media engagement, and email; by applying pressure to elected officials with phone calls, emails, and snail mail letters, and so on.<p>So, you would start a campaign by setting a variety of goals for these ways of applying pressure: number of letters to political representatives, size of social media presence, etc.  Then you delegate these goals to top lieutenants, so that one person becomes solely responsible for social media presence - the social media division if you will.  They can further delegate others, e.g. setting some other person as responsible for number of Twitter followers in the social media division.<p>To make things interesting, the site could either automatically, or via control by ""upper management"", promote people to higher levels if they have demonstrated exceptional ability in the goals they were originally assigned.  Goal progress would be visible, creating a competitive, game-like aspect to the application.<p>Anyway, perhaps not the best idea.  But the point is, I think that the field of political campaign management software could really use a shakeup.<p>Good luck!",1267238266

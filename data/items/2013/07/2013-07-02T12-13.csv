On the one hand trying to take money gives you a lot of focus and a short-term goal; getting enough traction to get investment.  VC money probably makes a lot of companies succeed short-term that might not otherwise.  Then on the other side of investment, VC money encourages a &quot;go big&quot; approach where you need to grow gangbusters which most people interpret as hire, spend, etc.  Seems like that might actually kill some companies that might otherwise be viable as they get over-extended and don&#x27;t pare back fast enough, then go broke.",1372769623

He was the guy who killed Osama and that sold really well. Republicans love strong national security, and democrats either do too (Reagan democrats), or are sick of their candidates being considered weak and soft on communisim/terrorism/etc. Democrats wouldn&#x27;t vote a President Kucinich because he is perceived as weak and at this point neither party wants to put up a candidate like that.

I have noticed that in the USA the policemens state of mind is much more violent (more movie style) and &quot;shoot first ask questions later&quot; than in Europe. 
I think is logical under their point of view, because  of the long campaign of fear and violence thats been playing on the media.
Also its true that american criminals are more likely to just draw a handgun and start a confrontation with police. Maybe this is due to the difference in prison sentence for the same crime. Here in Spain, most criminals just walk away after they spend a night in prison, and even a hard sentence  for drugs or a kill will have great discounts that effectively make stays longer than 10 years in prison very rare. Also live inside jails is much more humane than in the States.
Oppose that to the third strike rule, that will put you for live in jail even if the last offense is minor.(I dont know if this law is still active)",1372768008

The administration&#x27;s main political foes seem to recognize that there&#x27;s a big issue here (after all, slightly more than half of their constituents think that the NSA actions are &quot;hurting Americans&quot;[1]), but don&#x27;t quite know how to capitalize on it, since they were all in favor of things like this before the story broke.  The outrage within the US about this is spread so evenly across the usual parties that it&#x27;s not clear that there will be any actual fallout for future elections.<p>> The death of Snowden would put them on par with mafia.<p>I would suppose that if they choose to kill him, they&#x27;ll try pretty hard to do it in a way where it&#x27;s not provable that the US killed him.  Future-leaks-wise, though, it might seem beneficial for people to <i>suspect</i> that the US killed him, since presumably that would deter future leaks to some extent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/25/fox-news-poll-mixed-views-on-nsa-surveillance-program/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/25/fox-news-poll-mix...</a>",1372767436

My regular tech car won&#x27;t start unless its in park or neutral, why would I push on the brake?  My left foot is already busy kicking the parking brake out... and the Prius does in fact have a parking brake for the left foot to kick out making the UI even more confusing.  However it makes perfect sense to a manual transmission driver, because you always kick the parking brake out with your left foot and then hold the clutch in with left foot.<p>The confusing as hell part comes the first time you shut off the car and put your left foot on the parking brake to kick it out like you&#x27;d do with a normal car, and it boots up in accessory mode and won&#x27;t move.  WTF?  Hopefully you try leaving the parking brake alone and press the regular brake before you ask for a tow.<p>This is all beside the point.

I could buy a Matlab license for my server, but it&#x27;s basically up to me, so I probably won&#x27;t.<p>The other shift is that open-source tools seem to have been slowly been chipping away at the incumbents in statistical software.

It seems to be stagnating, perhaps the devs need to focus on other things or have moved on.

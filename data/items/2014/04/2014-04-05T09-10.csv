In a split second my mind took a holiday, away from work. I felt the joy of building up a marathon Civ4 game, just clicking away the time. It felt like the sun started shining on my mind, full intensity, after a long cold winter.<p>And any other time I would have just given in and started that game and wasted 2 weeks. But not anymore.<p>However, I thank my game addiction for keeping me sane through my depressions. Whenever one would set in, I would just game it away in 2 or 3 weeks. I lost a huge amount of time to various virtual worlds, but I think it has kept me alive, probably.<p>To get out of it though, I just try to get a bit of work done before starting up a game. Just half a minute to start with. I always lie to myself &quot;just one more small bugfix and then we&#x27;ll escape to SW:TOR (or whatever)&quot;. I try to make that 30 seconds into a minute, into 2 minutes, into 5, into half an hour. And sometimes, after weeks of trying, a full workday appears.

7536556,comment,7536283,7536283,1,0,colemorrison,,,"I totally can relate.  In fact, as shown in the other comments, MANY can relate.  Here&#x27;s what I do..<p>##Instead of trying to write every single step of what must be done out, I instead focus on 3 things.<p>1) The end goal (So, I&#x27;m programming an MVP)<p>2) The most immediate step that I can take that will make progress AND NOT STRESS ME OUT. (Get the development environment set up)<p>3) Blocking out everything between #1 and #2 the best that I can.<p>How do you find #2?  By taking whatever the end goal is, and splitting it down into pieces until you&#x27;ve identified a task that you KNOW you can accomplish without freaking out.  #2 should be a decent amount of work, but the threshold of when it&#x27;s too hard is when you don&#x27;t want to do it anymore...in which case, you keep breaking the problem up.<p>The logic behind this process is not just a quality of life thing.  It&#x27;s an objective and reasonable way to accomplish things.  By starting at the top and breaking things down, you&#x27;ve forced your mind to visualize parts of the process.  Most importantly though, there is literally no reason to write out every single step because:<p>a) It will just freak you out.<p>b) When you complete this most immediate step, the whole landscape of what you need to do may or may not change.<p>c) You attain focus by just having one step instead of trying to keep your mind from thinking about 100.<p>For example, if you plan out to add a feature to remove a particular database item and THEN add a feature to change one you may run into a stress point.  What happens if the first feature you go to add begets 3 critical errors that you must immediately fix?  Well, now you&#x27;re going to feel behind all day because unless those errors are quick to fix, you&#x27;ve still got step 2 ahead.<p>##Knock out 2 big things a day.  Bonus points for more.<p>These two big things are whatever you define.  I usually decide on 2 big things that seem of reasonable size, begin working on one, and adjust what those things are if need be.  This may not seem like a lot... but if you do it every day.  Like EVERY day.  They stack up.<p>To pick up momentum, make those things smaller at first.  As you get used to the process, scale them up.<p>##Check your thoughts regularly<p>If you start thinking depressive things.. smack your hand on a table really hard.  I&#x27;ll bet if you do that, you won&#x27;t be able to think anything except ow.  This is sort of a reactive thing.  But really, whenever you feel a thought popping in, just try and edit it accordingly.<p>##Journal<p>This is really theraputic.  Ask yourself questions in a journal and attempt to answer them.<p>Anyhow.  I&#x27;ve used the above processes to build large scale apps.  It also regularly helps me overcome any levels of depression.  It&#x27;s likely not the best.. but it helps me at least.",1396691499

Things I do that help:<p>- Uninstall all games and get rid of any mouses or other hardware that are used for games.<p>- Tell close friends and family about what you&#x27;re doing. Have social accountability.<p>- Find other activities that pull you away from your addictions.

The posts table has the username repeated every time a post was made, and the private message table has a horrible PHP serialized array containing the username in the &quot;To:&quot; column for a private message.<p>Changing a username on vBulletin involves an UPDATE statement on the post table, which is fine... but it involves iterating through every private message, de-serialising the To information, modifying and putting back.<p>And vBulletin is MySQL, and the search is full_text, which means MyISAM tables, and the update of the private message table locks for the duration, and for a large number of private messages the table is locked for 15 minutes on that particular server... which is enough time to cause a domino effect of query waits that PHP runs out of memory and one by one my frontend servers fail and the site goes offline.<p>Yup, vBulletin will crash and take the site offline if you have a large number of private messages and want to change a username.<p>You can see the fun of explaining this to the users of one forum over here: <a href=""https://www.lfgss.com/thread95475.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lfgss.com/thread95475.html</a><p>This is one of the very many annoyances that has led me to create <a href=""http://microco.sm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://microco.sm/</a> to fix this (and many other) pain points for admins and users.

7536463,comment,7536283,7536283,10,0,captain_mars,,,"Wow. I was thinking of writing a similar post just two days ago. I am almost the same as you; I have been struggling with procrastination for almost 20 years now, sometimes successfully and sometimes not.<p>Some quick notes about what I have understood:<p>* I am depressed. I have EVERY symptom of chronic depression listed here: <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/chronic-depression-dysthymia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/chronic-depression-dys...</a><p>However, I don&#x27;t know whether I procrastinate because I am depressed, or whether I am depressed because I procrastinate.<p>* Procrastination is a way of avoiding pain - the effort required in &quot;work&quot;.<p>* Procrastination itself is addictive: it gives instant pleasure instead of the pain of &quot;honest work&quot;. And the person procrastinating intellectually <i>knows</i> that it is bad for them, but once they are truly addicted to it, they are unable to stop.<p>* Procrastination is a habit, and habits can be changed.<p>* Habits are just patterns of behavior that we have memorized in our sub-conscious minds, so that we don&#x27;t have to <i>think</i> about performing a certain action, or taking a particular decision, over and over again. It is a labor-saving device for the mind. If we had to think anew about every action we do / every decision we take, we would quickly get tired. But once an action or decision become a habit, we don&#x27;t have to think about it; it just happens automatically. That&#x27;s a great energy saver, if the actions / decisions are &quot;good&quot; for us, but can be life-destroying if the actions / decisions are &quot;bad&quot; for us.<p>* Habits can be changed. First, mentally review what you will do the next time you are in a &quot;moment of choice&quot; - such as sitting in front of your computer. Resolve to do your client work instead of playing a game. Actually visualize doing that: ignoring the urge to play a game, calming yourself until the urge subsides, and then calmly doing the &quot;right thing (TM)&quot; - opening up your IDE and coding.<p>Next, when you really are in the moment of choice, really do the above. To elaborate: You will feel the urge to fire up a game. At that moment, tell yourself that you have been down that road before, and you know where it leads. Tell yourself that it is ruining your life, and you won&#x27;t accept it any more. That you will do the &quot;right thing&quot; (TM) no matter what. At this moment, you may have to stop everything and just breathe slowly and deeply until the &quot;urge&quot; to play the game subsides and you are calm again. Once you are calm, it is easy to take the right decision.<p>The first few times you do this, you may find it difficult, or almost impossible. But trust me, it can be done. And the more often you do thins (calm yourself until you can do the Right Thing), the easier it will become. You see, this will slowly become your new habit, and the old habit will fade away because you will no longer be reinforcing it.<p>All the best! Write to me: tech.rohit@gmail.com",1396688643

5354439,comment,5352462,5353452,2,0,kentlyons,,,"I like Clay Christensen's model for innovation [1]. He has a top level categorization of sustaining innovation and disruptive innovation.<p>Sustaining innovations are about making products in existing markets better and are further broken down into continuous innovation and discontinuous or radical innovations. The metrics here are about if the new innovation is improving performance within an existing market and by existing value metrics, and by how much. Continuous innovations are small improvements, radical innovations are large improvements.<p>Disruptive innovations are also broken down into two categories. There is the low end disruption whereby a product is competing in the same space as existing ones, but comes in from below. These are often cheaper and worse to start with, but then move up market as technology improves. There are many examples here (eg Arm coming in under x86). The other disruptive innovation is the new market innovation. In Christensen's terminology, these products compete against non-competition. There is a need, but no products fullfils that need until the disruption comes along. These products are tricky for several reasons. For one, there is no existing market and therefore traditional market research doesn't work. Instead, the execution plan needs to be focused on learning what the market is and what the customer needs are.<p>1] The series of books starting with the Innovator's Dilemma are a good read on innovation.

However I skipped all of the UI builder stuff (which is the primary reason you'd want to use it in the first place) and coded directly against the Windows API, with the help of some inline asm.<p>So why not just use C? There were good reasons. In 1992 C/C++ compilers on the PC were slow -- pre-compiled headers were still mysterious -- and Delphi's handwritten compiler and integrated linker made the edit/compile/run cycle very very fast. It made small, fast, completely stand-alone (no MSVCRT.DLL or anything) binaries -- a feature which still supposedly makes it popular with malware authors.<p>The UI builder was excellent and perfect for knocking off one-off tools like the terrain generator described above. As long as you stuck to Windows, of course.<p>I don't know if I would necessarily go back though. While I sometimes miss some of Pascal's features like ranged types and sets (and bounds checking on arrays) the performance advantages of the specific Borland implementation have become less important, and there are other contenders that cover a bigger problem space than the delta between Pascal and C.<p>BTW, here's where Google Trends says Delphi is popular nowadays: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=delphi&cmpt=q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=delphi&cmpt=q</a>",1362965670

5354342,comment,5350778,5352300,2,0,triplesec,,,"I don't think your argument is inconsistent with the argument you're countering. There is room for both emulation-enhancement of analogue instruments - a very useful function and one which the makers of this seaboard seem to be leaning towards - and the creation of brand new instruments through synth (and new interfac) technology. Indeed these two functions come closer together as we create new interface-noise style hybrids.<p>Additional points of interest which do not affect your actual argument, but which are good for clarification: the most responsive pipe organs use tracker action, which being mechanical allows much more control than the more ""modern"" but less responsive electropneumatic actions necessary for the very largest instruments. IT makes the action from pressing key to opening the pipe faster - much of the latency in the organ is often in the pneumatics - but of course cannot change the distance issues.<p>also Attack makes a huge difference to the sound on a well-voiced instrument, and this makes a huge difference. Subtleties in duration are of course also as vast on the Organ as they are with the piano and other instruments.",1362964041

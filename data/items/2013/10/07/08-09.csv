We know that South Asian and Tibeto-Burman people have been milk and cheese consumers for a long time, as have the Central Asian peoples including the Mongols, who are said to have actually preferred liquid foods to solid ones.<p>These days, I know first hand that a lot of people in China are getting stuck in to milk products for the first time. How can this be, if they should keel over in pain and indigestive flatulence? The only person I&#x27;ve ever seen mass-produce cheese in an apartment was a Burmese friend in China, who I&#x27;m sure wasn&#x27;t after the lactose for its apparent usefulness in diluting heroin! Wikipedia states: <i>Some studies indicate that environmental factorsmore specifically, the consumption of lactosemay &quot;play a more important role than genetic factors in the etio-pathogenesis of milk intolerance&quot;</i> ... ie. the intolerance notion is largely bullshit and people can adapt to lactose. That seems to fit the observations.<p>Anyway, interesting to ponder... I went and polished off a block of New Zealand cheddar to celebrate. (Saving Roquefort for a salad tomorrow, then it&#x27;s off to Indonesia where cheese is no doubt harder to find!)",1381136266

How would we &quot;move&quot; the servers, without a significantly higher risk of the data being leaked?  Assuming Europe, that&#x27;s an 8 hour flight at the least.<p>I&#x27;m guessing people are assuming Europe as the bastion of all things good here.  Certainly it&#x27;s more affordable for hosting than Australia, and more reliably connected than anywhere else.<p>A more realistic scenario, if we had the budget for it, would be to buy a duplicate set of hardware, install it in the theoretical new location, duplicate all the data, grandfather everything running at NYI.<p>This would be a process that would take months or years of real time as well, plus quite a lot of admin time.  Just duplicating all the email, well - I did it recently, I carried an almost full set of backups on encrypted hard disks from New York to Australia (the key was only ever in tmpfs on the host in New York, copied in over ssh inside a VPN link, and all copies nuked and the server rebooted and reinstalled before I left New York)  Even filling those disks at the maximum IO rate we could sustain took over a week - and unpacking it at the other end would take as long again.<p>All this for theoretical security against one of very many risks we face.  It is my considered opinion that we can get better return on our security investment (both time and money) in other ways than scrambling to get everything out of the USA.<p>And &quot;emails being read by the US Government&quot; is only one of very many security threats.  We could make our users&#x27; emails VERY secure by putting all our servers in the shredder - it might reduce uptime and recoverability of data somewhat...<p>... so I&#x27;m hoping most informed potential customers understand that there are other risks in the world, and we balance our defenses amongst the various risks.<p>Throwing away everything that&#x27;s good about our New York hosting in exchange for maybe being more secure against one particular risk is not a decision to make lightly, your assertions nonwithstanding.",1381135570

Not just because they don&#x27;t want to. Because they can&#x27;t. This means interest payments rising at a rate faster than inflation a given.<p>2) &quot;Real&quot; expenditures (as demostrated by the US shutdown for example) take precedence over loan repayments. As they should.<p>3) This being blatantly obvious is not stopping a great many people from buying ridiculously bad government debt. The US, all of Europe (not just the EU), Japan and most of Asia with it, are trying to induce inflation by printing exponentially more money over time. It&#x27;s not working, meaning none of those countries are getting any closer to paying back their debts, even if it was realistic.<p>1+2+3 = Every country on this planet, with few exceptions, will default on their debts. They may do it by hyperinflation (unlikely, as it will make all of the population very unhappy) or they may just outright default (just makes investors unhappy, and as Greece demonstrated[1], they have very few options left). But there is no way out of this situation that does not involve a large number of government defaults.<p>We&#x27;ve long since jumped from the plane.

Well, the global economy is becoming more and more linked as time passes. A US default will trigger a collapse in the larger global financial markets. Do US creditors want this ? Nope. They&#x27;ll just keep extending deadlines but of course this charade can only last for a certain amount of time. Personally, I think the collapse will not come from a US default but due to this bubble over extending itself and eventually popping in a Lehman&#x27;esque style.<p>An example of this is how last year India (a developing country, although with a rather large GDP) donated money to the European Union in the form of an economic stimulus, basically to prevent a default. The reason was simple, an unstable european market hurts growth prospects worldwide. There&#x27;s a saying in India &quot;When Wall Street sneezes the Indian markets catch a cold&quot;. An increasingly linked global economy puts economic stability at #1 on everyone&#x27;s agenda. Of course, this is great for the US because they can wage wars, etc. etc. while taking on unlimited debt and no one wants to lift a finger (militarily, they can&#x27;t - economically, they can&#x27;t either because of the repercussions).

However, that argument is false. The argument behind taxes is that there is a government that allocates certain resources towards community goals - security, infrastructure, welfare. These resources need to be paid for and so the government raises taxes - on income, on property, on cars etc. All the money collected gets redistributed and none of it is tied to the sector it came from: My income tax pays for roads, railways, kindergardens alike even though I don&#x27;t own a car and rarely drive and don&#x27;t have any kids.

I have actively refused it for a long time, and even now I am very picky about it -- my friends list has a bunch of people I don&#x27;t even know, my location frequently changes and I access it only through Tor because I hate Facebook&#x27;s privacy policy (or lack of thereof). That being said, I was the last in my group of friends to do it. Most of them opened their FB account years ago. I opened it because one of my friends left the country, but he doesn&#x27;t use an IM program, nor checks his e-mail too often, and this was pretty much the only way to stay in touch.<p>I noticed a bunch of weird things about FB-trained users:<p>* A few days ago, I threw a party and invited two good friends that I haven&#x27;t seen in a while. Both of them were a bit pissed on me, because I&#x27;d moved to Ireland without so much as dropping by to tell them I&#x27;m leaving, but were happy to see me and had struggled to make it to the party, because they knew I&#x27;d probably be going back soon. Now, I&#x27;ve never even <i>been</i> to Ireland, let alone move there, so I was understandably dumbfounded, until I realized that the last location I&#x27;d listed on Facebook was a city in Ireland. The thought that someone would take the location I list <i>on the Internet</i> seriously didn&#x27;t even cross my mind. Hell, when I started using the Internet, around a quarter of the other users claimed they were from Middle Earth, and I claimed I was from Coruscant!<p>* Facebook events. I nearly missed a friend&#x27;s anniversary because he just opened a Facebook event, instead of inviting everyone over. You know, by telephone. Needless to say, I probably skipped over it in my inbox or whatever they call it.<p>* &quot;Like&quot; and &quot;Epic&quot;. I consistently denied using the former without leaving a comment, because I think it&#x27;s lazy, but the latter is, unfortunately, starting to enter my vocabulary. At first, whenever someone was saying that this or that had been epic, I was literally asking them what exactly they meant. I&#x27;m seriously alarmed by this, as our entire vocabulary is being invaded by &quot;lazy&quot; words that can mean pretty much anything you want them to mean. &quot;Epic&quot; is the new &quot;nice&quot;. Is it sunny outside? Whoa, what a nice, warm day. Is it raining? Whoa, how nice and cozy. Is there a fucking blizzard outside? This is going to be such a nice Christmas day!

But I&#x27;ve never been able to find an answer for this question for this type of argument.<p>What we&#x27;re talking about is how to value a company&#x27;s ability to destroy another company&#x27;s value, not how to value a company&#x27;s ability to create value.  That&#x27;s like the business of assassination.  Assassins can say what their price is to kill someone.  If you took that business away, and that was their only way to demonstrate worth, then what do they have left?  They&#x27;d have to get into a completely different business to continue life.<p>So if Twitter succeeds in assassinating Facebook&#x27;s value, or even the entire company (unlikely, but let&#x27;s just follow the line of thought to its logical end), what next?  Where&#x27;s their value going to come from next?  If there was valid income generation that can simply take the place of Facebook (or anything else Twitter destroys), why couldn&#x27;t that value have been measured already?<p>Or if it is measured already, is it just like how the Internet has caused the music industry to earn digital pennies instead of the past&#x27;s analog dollars?

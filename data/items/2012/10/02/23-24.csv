It's how the FBI caught the ""Scarecrow Bandits"" in Texas. <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10451518-38.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10451518-38.html</a><p>There was also a recent case where the FBI was looking for a person distributing child pornography on Youtube. They found that 3 of his IP addresses originated at hotels. So they cross-referenced the hotel guest registries and identified the one guy who had been registered at all the hotels at the relevant times.<p>This seems like a perfectly legitimate method of investigating a crime and I don't think anyone is arguing that police ought to be prevented from doing what they did with the Scarecrow Bandits.<p>The problem is that the Government wants to be able to target a person and track their movements via a cellphone based only on a showing of reasonable grounds to believe that the location data is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. This essentially allows the government to conduct fishing expeditions.",1349222357

4605067,comment,4603204,4603204,1,0,tolmasky,,,"I think telling people that just their password was wrong was a bad move. The author argues that this is not a security risk because the ""username reminder form already tells you if a username exists"". However, this simply displays a further security issue. I don't have the link handy, but there was just a (really good) article the other day here on Hacker News about why you should not reveal whether the email address is necessarily associated with a username or password in these kinds of forms (always just give the same generic ""we will send it if it exists"" message).",1349222342

There's a line between banter and offense. I would never want anyone in my team to be offended and I tend to try to (mostly) stay on the side of caution on the banter front mainly because my job is to make it as easy as possible for people to do theirs. I did feel from the photos that the author's attire was not appropriate for the offices we work in (but might be fine for his), but find comparisons to Run DMC much more inappropriate. For one, if I was a member of Run DMC I would greatly protest against the style of the author's dress sense, but then again I grew up in the 80s, the decade that fashion forgot.<p>At the end of the article, it's clear there are no winners, only losers. It's good that the author is no longer there because he doesn't have to deal with idiots like that. Life's too short to have to put up with any form of crap in an environment that doesn't suit you, regardless of the reasons. It's also good for the idiots working there that he's no longer there either because frankly they lack the maturity in their environment (even if they have it individually) to cope with having someone that doesn't fit their world view there. Racism in the workplace is unacceptable but it does happen[1]. The trick is to deal with it sensitively and objectively while making sure that people understand that they're wrong, why they're wrong and what they need to do to be right. If they screw up with it repeatedly, then maybe they need to find a new job.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RovF1zsDoeM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RovF1zsDoeM</a>",1349222327

This made for many painful projects and unhappy clients, usually beginning 6-8 weeks into the project when the issues of database drift became inevitable.<p>And like you said, everything lives in the database. So the chances that some production issue (or new issue only seen in dev) was caused by an errant user action in the Drupal UI was pretty high, and this made debugging a nightmare -- where is my issue really coming from?<p>I'd just about forgotten about my Drupal days of yore, and between the ""click monkey"" analogy and the ""clear the cache"" nostalgia, the author sure conjured up some bad memories!",1349222239

4605023,comment,4601654,4602321,1,0,nxn,,,"To preface, let's say that ""application-scale"" means something like the following: your server outputs a single html file that only contains references to js files and css (i.e., the minimum to get the app to work right), from then on all data operations are ajax calls to a server side API, while the entire state of the app, all UI/markup components included, is maintained via JS.<p>I've worked on a couple of these applications, they almost always end up having some fake-class system that provides mechanisms for encapsulation, code sharing, and namespacing. There's often almost a hundred of these fake classes defined with thousands of instances living in memory. I grant you that you can use things like the module pattern to accomplish those requirements -- in fact, if you couldn't, then I wouldn't be here talking about it because I'd be writing Java applets instead. But the lack of having static typing to catch simple errors and enabling basic refactoring tools (like renaming something without having to use a regular expression which took 2 hours to ""perfect"", or simply switching argument orders, etc) was the absolute worst. I've spent countless hours debugging problems that occurred because something like a string was accidentally passed when an array was expected, and only having the actual runtime error occur 50 function calls later because something like ""cat""[0] was working fine up to that point. Static typing would have caught that before I even ran the app.<p>Anyway, these types of apps perhaps aren't as common as websites, but they exist and therefore there is a need for statically typed languages for the browser.",1349221684

I also wonder if they'd agree on the bitcoin price in advance, or if they would pin it to the dollar value up to transfer.<p>Either way, imagine being the buyer, taking up a loan, maybe buying the bitcoins, and then suddenly not having enough money because the price has gone up/down.",1363953516
5422403,story,,,6,3,seanccox,"Ask HN: Can I automate document gathering for research?",,"I conduct  research into companies and individuals  due diligence, litigation support, public records checks, and media scans.<p>I find that I often need to repeat searches on the same individuals at different websites and news archives, only to repeat the entire process again with a new name.<p>I haven't a programming background, so forgive me if I'm not using the right terms. I speculate that the process can be accomplished automatically by a webcrawler... though I'm not certain if that is the right solution, and I don't have a clear picture of what the risks in attempting to automate this process might be.<p>At the risk of being long-winded, here's a typical case. I'm given the name of the firm, it's principal management, and maybe a few articles from the company website. My task is to find out if anyone at the company has been accused of a crime, or whether the company has been sued or engaged in fraud. I open tabs in a browser for each of the main websites/databases I will search (chambers of commerce, trade registries, government websites, etc.). Then, one by one, I put each name into each tab and look for results, all the while saving copies of any relevant documents I find. At the end of it all, I  piece together the story of the company or person, using the documents as support. This is the mundane part of the job  gathering the documents.<p>Is there a way to automate that process? Since I'm learning to code anyway, I'd like to try exploring a solution myself, but I'm not certain what language or process would be best for that. I'd love to hear the advice of the HN community.<p>Cheers,
-Sean",1363953504

They weren't offended by my comments I think, but maybe more shocked?<p>I remember an incident whilst we were walking to lunch, a guy came out of a parking lot with squealing tires... which made me say my most crude comment while I was working there: ""Someone is on their period"". Sure, I generalised women with that joke, but I didn't mean anything by saying it (just that he was probably cranky..) - it's a joke, the girl I was with could of equally said, ""I'm sure that dude has a small penis."" I have a regular non-12"" cock (I'm not ashamed to admit that) and I wouldn't of been offended. But her comment was, ""SAMMM! That's not very PC!"". The guy I was with commented, ""Ahh, dude, not PC man"". All said and done, they were fun people to work with and didn't make a big deal out of it besides commenting, not pc.<p>Comedians always generalise, and making jokes that are in context with a current situation isn't weird. Come on, loosen up, life is boring when you are forced to only say serious things... We spend most of our lives working. Why should we be forced to spend most of our lives being boring whilst hiding our personality?<p>This is actually one of the top reasons I'd be afraid of working in the USA again. I don't want to get fired or sued over ""sexual harassment"" due to a comment like the one I mentioned earlier. That, and the fact that if I'd get fired, I'd have to leave the country within a week...<p>I do agree, that making a joke specifically about a person you work with, or are in a room with is a big no-no - well, if it's harsh. A meaningless non degrading joke is fine which isn't meant in a serious way. But don't make jokes about people you're with regarding their sex life. People are touchy about that and I can understand. General sex jokes that don't degrade a certain sex? Fine!<p>In my books, although I find it funny and mean nothing by it, I wouldnt say the following in a work environment:
""I have an appointment to get a facial, I'll be back later.""
 - ""Lol! Tell him not to get some in your eye!""",1363952193

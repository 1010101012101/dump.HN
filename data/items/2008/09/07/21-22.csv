But one things is for sure,  no company in the past was able to predict what the future would bring - if they did they would have switched their ways.   I think the sad fact is that these changes in mainstream mindset are very fluid and hard to predict and survival of the fittest company/solution is very much a game of chance.<p>This might be a reason for the longevity of larger companies like GE that can afford to have many bets on the table.",1220824737

But the article does seem unusually asinine. ""Leadership in the branch of science that delivered just about every major technology of the past hundred years?"" Physics, broadly defined, has delivered major technologies, yes. (Just about every major technology! Don't be distracted by minor technologies like antibiotics, restriction enzymes, pesticides, fertilizers, plastics, etc.) But once you define physics so broadly that it includes transistors and lasers and satellites, the US is still doing fairly well under that definition. Massive spending in the subfield of high-energy physics doesn't give you leadership in the entire broad field of physics, and there's no particular reason to expect major technologies will come primarily from from the high energy subfield in the future. Granting for the sake of argument the silly apparent assumption that outspending is outdoing, CERN still doesn't deliver leadership in subfields like condensed matter physics that may still have a few technologies left in them.",1220824695

You have to know the context: The situation is very special in germany at the moment. Here is a big discussion about privacy and data security. There was a big scandal some weeks ago because a call center company sold some data from its customers and other companys abused these informations. Somehow the politicians and goverment agencys have a ""bad conscience"" now.<p>2. Im a lawyer and i think if the warning is really an official warning it is rather problematic (for the goverment agency, not for google). But one has to know that in germany some ministries understand themselves somehow as consumer protection agencies. It is a little bit different than in other countries i guess.<p>3. The warning is more directed to people who dont know much about the internet: mums and dads and aol-users and so on. The goverment agency didnt tell them anything different then that what every reader of this page here already knows.",1220824440
297755,comment,297505,297505,0,0,LarryV,,,"While I am a bit worried about how scatterbrained AdventNet seems to be - I do think that they have a chance to disrupt a very inefficient and parasitic software eco-system that exists in Business Software.   They only need to figure out the integration piece and the fact that they have played with some Microsoft Active Directory tools and embrace outside identity systems may help them get there.<p>I have found that the biggest draw to ""integrated"" software is not having a new set of credentials to login into it.<p>I am finding some success with technologies that can play nice with various directories.  I am currently playing with Novell's EDirectory and its Identity Management solutions and it surprises me how few companies focus on what I see as one of the central problems in business IT: the seamless integration between the company's CRM, the team's contacts and the directories that power each business solution.<p>There is a huge need for a business class 'identity-in-the-cloud' solution that speak to many internal systems using software hooks/drivers that are  very transparent, have good auditing and can be controlled by the company/customer.<p>I bet a large percentage of software projects at companies have overlapping user management sub-systems that could be better addressed by an identity-in-the-cloud system like the ones emerging from Microsoft, Google et al.<p>And for those who say that your company has too many secrets to possibly use an outside solution for identity - get over it, it is not true.  You have many people forwarding things to their Gmail accounts and many mobile devices around the country without even a pin code to secure them.   Your sense of security is an illusion,  embrace solutions that can provide complete audits of what happens with them, then you will know how insecure you really are and plan around the fact that total security is impossible.  And your internal development team will never reach the self-auditing stage of the solution because as soon as it half works they are pulled to something else.",1220824355

In 1920 you most certainly can come up with the idea of killing bacteria by eating something - people did it every day! Sure they had no idea if it works, or why it works, or what to eat. But the basic idea: eat something and make the illness go away was there.<p>There are no ideas in AI. AI reaserchers these days are working on sub-problems, vision recognition, speech, pretending to reply to someone, but none of them have any ideas on how to make AI work.<p>They just hope that by putting all these things together something will come out - and they will probably be able to make a robot that is a smart as a dog for example.<p>But they have no ideas for how to program creativity - no one does.",1220823564

If other products want to win me over, they can't cite lack of time and expect a good response</i><p>I agree, Word is (arguably) Microsoft's premier product that they put out. Many people will say that Windows is, but I think Windows is their flagship product, people use it because they think they have too. People opt in for Word.<p>Anyway, when was the last time that Word was just a word processor? There are a lot of features in word that can be thought of to be excessive. I'd be curious to see what the actual numbers were on features and usage, as I have a sneaking suspicion that a large number of people who use word use it for simple document editing, saving, opening and printing.<p>Sites like Zoho currently do this, quite well actually, so I think it's a case of Zoho has to break through 25 years of branding more than anything else.",1220823210

With Microsoft controlling the browser, they could conceivably release an ad blocker in IE8 and turn it on by default.  Google would be in serious trouble very fast.<p>I'm not trying to say that this will happen, just that Google's being smart and mitigating risk.  Until they start making serious money from their office applications, however, creating their own browser seems to me to be a defensive move, not an offensive one.",1220823208

The KEY to the redesign is that no matter what I do, it becomes almost impossible to make it into a mess. I also made the default position of things very conducive to not making a mess, so after a little work at the beginning, there is no further work.<p>Step 1: Empty desk. No cups or paper holders or anything like that<p>Step 2: Digitalise what can be digitalised, and sort away all papers that are not directly relevant<p>Step 3: Get 2 baskets, one for unimportant papers, another for papers you have to order. When anything comes in that is not critical, drop them in the basket. Don't keep the basket on your desk, keep it away in your cupboard. We don't push paper that often.<p>Step 4: Sort the cables out. Tape them, put them away sensibly<p>Step 6: Get really good lights<p>Step 7: Get something to play with for when you are thinking. I personally use a 50 cm wooden ruler, and apart from my PC and a pen, that's the only thing on my desk. If I did not have it, I'd have chewed the pen dead by now.<p>When you work with a clean desk things feel a lot tidier. When you have stuff on the desk, only when they are extremly high priority. Having a neat desk will make you focus even better on the stuff that is important when it does come on your desk.<p>And if you have a desktop, consider moving it somewhere else. I keep mine in the closet and use it via network - that way I have some quiet.<p>So, my suggestion is to plan in a way that it gets difficult to get untidy.",1220823154

5066147,comment,5065836,5065836,2,0,johnfuller,,,"One way you could do this and make it feasible to last forever would be to form a non profit to take donations and volunteers, build a P2P system and get enough of a fan base to keep it going. That way you would only need volunteers to maintain the client software / protocols. The only cost would be the entry point domain and the servers to keep the web presence going, though it's possible you could find a hosting service which would donate the server space. Donations should cover any other costs.<p>The sites would need to be static snapshots and piggy back off the main domain. You could direct traffic from external domains, but those domains would likely die at some point. Perhaps you could even partner with a DNS service such as CloudFlare so that users could have an option to direct traffic to your service when certain actions happen (site is down for a certain amount of time.) The domain would still die eventually though, and the links would go with it. Ultimately I'm not sure that losing links would be a big deal anyways, as links to your main domain would die off eventually as well.<p>This service would be sort of like a love child of Tor and archive.org except that it would specifically be setup so that your site would always have a URL to reach the site directly rather than having to do a search. Archive.org might already have a scheme where links to a site snapshot will never change, but I'm not sure about that as it's probably not the main focus of the service.<p>I think this would be more interesting that attempting to build a commercial service. A commercial service would probably end up being like a ponzi scheme where you would need enough new users to cover costs to pay for the old users. Archive.org and Wikipedia seem to be doing okay though, so perhaps you could go the same route as a non profit but on more typical hosting infrastructure.",1358330571

5066143,comment,5062761,5063964,8,0,pornel,,,"1. CSS1 started modestly by specifying very little over what browsers already did at the time, and from the start locked itself into HTML's inline/block/float/table model.<p>Back then the old Netscape engine was dominant and it couldn't get even those basics right (<a href=""http://acid1.acidtests.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acid1.acidtests.org</a>), so there was no hope of adoption of a more advanced layout mechanism.<p>2. CSS had deliberate limitations that did help early implementors: e.g. elements later in the document are not supposed to cause reflow of elements earlier (with tables being ""legacy"" exception). That's how Opera worked until v6. That what helped all browsers implement progressive rendering. The downside is abysmal vertical centering and limited selectors (flexbox and CSS4 selectors finally drop that limitation).<p>3. It was hard to get any progress on this for many, many years. First we had Netscape 4, then we had IE6 holding back use of CSS on the web, so specs from that time were mostly untested ivory tower science-fiction.<p>Things got better since, but of course now we have massive legacy and backward-compatibility constrains... and IE8/9 holding back flexbox.",1358330522
5066142,comment,5065089,5065089,9,0,MehdiEG,,,"A surprisingly good list. Beyond the xib issue, which other have talked about, I would add a couple of points:<p>- If developing a trivial utility app you're expecting to release quickly, target iOS version N-1. Any user who is more that one major iOS version behind won't be the type of user who will download your app (or any app really).<p>If developing anything more ambitious, target the latest iOS version only and take full advantage its new APIs. By the time you're ready to go mainstream (a few iterations of the app under your belt, nailed your marketing strategy, etc), there will have been at least one new major iOS version released and any time and effort you spent writing code for older iOS versions will have been wasted.<p>(talking from experience here :)<p>- Before writing a single line of code, sort out your logging. At the very least, use a handful of macros like [0] to print the class, message name and line number when logging and to exclude debug log statements from release builds. Or check out something like CocoaLumberjack (haven't tried myself yet but writing this made me realize I need to sort out my own logging system so will give it a shot).<p>[0] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/969130/how-to-print-out-the-method-name-and-line-number-and-conditionally-disable-nslog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/969130/how-to-print-out-t...</a>",1358330506

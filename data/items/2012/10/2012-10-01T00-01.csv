4594838,comment,4593902,4593902,10,0,bickfordb,,,"Traumatic brain injury is real, completely life debilitating and can happen at very slow speeds.  Many parts of your brain are protected only by soft tissue.  Brains do not grow back like a broken arm/leg.  Imagine permanently losing 100 IQ points by not paying attention for the wrong five seconds.  Cyclists are extremely vulnerable on streets shared by cars.  Think slow moving ~<180lb two wheeled bean bags vs. 1500+lb high speed steel boxes.  It's pretty irresponsible and absurd for the NYT to print articles like this.  I suppose we shouldn't use seatbelts or car bumpers either based on mean effects?  Helmet safety is totally cheap (basic, OK helmets are $20-30) and easy to use.  Although I would certainly like to make everyone ""healthy"" and build a cycling utopia, the fitness argument this article makes is completely absurd. Obese, unhealthy people casually cycling for ten or fifteen minutes across a city are unlikely to receive any significantly health benefit (reach aerobic thresholds) and are the the most likely to experience falls and collisions since they are inexperienced.",1349053177

4594830,comment,4593902,4594551,4,0,dialtone,,,"Maybe it's a stereotype and it definitely doesn't apply to everyone but I've never seen so much confusion as on american roads. I'm from Italy and we're routinely made fun of for the mess that is our traffic, the reality though is that in Italy it is way more predictable and correct, blinkers are always used for example, than in SF where I've lived for the past 5 years. Italy has very few miles of bicycle lanes and yet most people don't use an helmet.<p>As I ride around town on a bike, there are all sorts of people that either just don't look when crossing, or look at the sky when moving sideways on a lane, or simply cross lanes reserved for bikes with the idea that pedestrians always have precedence.<p>Many cyclists are also guilty of the same types of sins by stopping in the middle of the street without so much as moving on the side or they are simply not capable of riding a bike in a city or they just perform U turns without looking at oncoming traffic. A friend of mine unfortunately died on a bike here in SF, was it because she wasn't wearing an helmet? Nope, it was because she turned left without looking and a food truck ran over her. She was the first and only fatality for bike accident last year.<p>When I passed my Driving License test here in SF the examiner told me that it's usually the americans that gave her the most troubles while europeans tended to always pass at the first try.<p>So maybe it's a stereotype but it seems to me that the american government went out of their way to try to protect pedestrians and defend cyclists with the result that they now walk around without their brain sparing the necessary few cycles to keep themselves safe on the street.<p>EDIT:
A funny thing that I've seen happening only here are cars that go through half of a cross-road and when they see you coming they just stop in the middle occupying the whole lane and forcing you to try to stop in a short space. If they went through instead of stopping there would have been no issues. This happens to me so often that I can't help laughing at it every time I see it.",1349053089

I work in robotics, and all of the software folk at our lab try to adhere to a very TDD/BDD based workflow; working here is the first time I've been exposed to it, and it's changed the way that I code not so much by altering the quality (though this has probably improved as a side-effect), but by making me more ""productive"" in the short term.<p>I'm a serial procrastinator; not in the cutesy demotivational poster way, but in a way that is legitimately harmful to my productivity and success if I don't find a way to reign it in.  It was a big problem years ago.  I failed classes in school, missed deadlines at old jobs and internships.  I've become a lot better at being responsible, but every now and again I feel the same old apathy set in, and I can go a day or two at around 50% of my normal output.  I find that when I need to start writing a new Class or do anything that might be front-loaded in the cognitive effort department, or just suffering from a block in general, it helps to just start writing code, no matter what it is.  The process of hitting keys acts a great sort of ignition and warm-up for the diesel engine that is my brain.  If I'm going to mindlessly hammer out code, it would help if it's useful.  And a well-formed unit test, by its very nature, should be small, simple, and informative of the behavior of the code that it tests but shouldn't actually be all that cognitively taxing to write if you understand the nature of the problem but haven't landed on an implementation.  Brain-dumping a behavioral outline that happens to be useful and in code form is much more useful than trying to hack on the problem I'm actually trying to solve and having to go back later and engage in a refactoring marathon.<p>In this way, practicing TDD has helped me lay out a system to kick-start myself when I start to slump.

It started in December 1989, when the first Pentium was still three years into the future. If Guido had tried to ""foresight"" his way to a language with an acceptable multicore solution at that point (on any hardware he could afford), the only possible result is total failure. I don't think there are many attributes the language currently possesses that were truly that avoidable. Most people's snap suggestions result in incurring costs to the language that it may not be able to recover from when it is young.<p>Personally, I think the truth is that Python is what it is; a very, very, very good OO language that has reached the mature stage of its life. It probably won't be able to make the leap to ""true"" multicore, and besides, even if it does it won't be likely to be very successful anyhow because it'll still be a very slow-but-powerful language.<p>(There's very little point in taking a language very near the bottom of the Shootout and adding 4 or even 8 way parallelism to it, when you could just rewrite the target hotspot in C and get the same performance on one core. The math just doesn't favor trying to add lots of ""multicore"" to such a <i>slow</i> language. Python's one of my favorite languages, but that doesn't mean I can't see where it is weak.)",1349051642

EMH, roughly speaking, says that prices correspond to <i>expected values</i> of future values. That doesn't specify a timeframe (which is one of the problems with EMH; it's demonstrably false over very short time frames in which arbitrage occurs, and also over very long timeframes) but it's not incompatible with bubbles. Over the course of a bubble with a short timeframe (which is a reasonable assumption for something highly liquid) the expected value of the price <i>is</i> actually increasing (even if the very long term expected value is lower; in the long run, we are all dead).<p>Markets favor availability over consistency. You can trade at a price. That price might be a couple percent higher or lower tomorrow. That's called ""volatility"", and we model it as Brownian motion (although it's more fat-tailed than a normal distribution). The inconsistency exists because no one really knows what the true fair value of equity is, but the market can deliver a price that usually represents the expected value of the thing in the future. Markets don't do a perfect job of pricing these things, but no one has ever been able to do a better job.<p>The best argument for financiers as ""the good guys"" is that, from about 1950 to 2007, financial markets have become riskier and more volatile while the real economy has become less so. There's an argument to be made that these markets have taken risk out of the economy and transfered it into markets that can crash without wiping people out. There's also an argument to be made that the ongoing collapse of the middle class has something to do with ""activist"" investors (PEtards) and that this evil more than cancels out the good. Not going to form a strong opinion on that one.<p>Then there was 2008. That one got blamed on the quants, but it's actually people on the business side, especially the ones involved in real estate (and industry that has about as much integrity as Hitler's scrotum). Yes, finance has scumbags like every other industry, and the 2008 crash was horrible and showed how disgusting a lot of powerful people are willing to be.<p>I don't know what to believe. I'll say this, though: the people I meet in finance are much better than people at the higher levels of VC-istan. I've met $1-million-per-year traders who are really great people, while most startup founders and executives I've met are pretty goddamn slimy. (I'm sure counterexamples exist, but in my VC-istan experience, fundraising ability and decency are correlated at about -1.0.) VC-istan is, after all, funded by private equity guys rather than quants, so what the fuck else would one expect?",1349050215

I have two favorite startups (both YC funded) that I am extremely intrigued by. These products/services get my heart pumping and I don't want to work for anybody else. I know I can help them grow (I've done it for much less interesting value propositions).<p>I told them both I'd work for low/no pay remotely to prove myself before I relocate. I had a Skype chat set-up for one (which I got blown off) and I gave my cell phone number to the other who hasn't since called me.<p>I'm thinking about doing this: what if I sell/market their product and show them I am capable? Send them a list of customers I found for them, it would be like free lead generation? One company is B2C so this would be a little bit more difficult. My biggest issue is I couldn't approach these prospects as working for the company since this would be unethical. But maybe I can work around it?<p>What do you think?",1349050128

They genuinely think that the patent system is good for innovation. Most engineers I know, outside the software bubble, feel the same way. They think in terms of patents regulating unfair business practices in the competition between Dow Chemical and DuPont or Lockheed and Raytheon.

I will checkout this link, it looks like there is a lot of interesting resources.<p>Regarding the first part of your comment: I don't think that is the case. We don't usually add backend code without UI (I don't have a measurement for this unfortunately). Our bug tracker or tracking method has not changed since we first installed Trac in 2007.<p>TDD definitely adds more development time (especially in the beginning where you have to learn the practice and put test frameworks in place). However, I think it's good because I see it as a good investment: you spend time upfront writing test instead of spending more time afterwards troubleshooting broken software. Even better, the test suite can catch regressions long after a feature has been implemented, so you get even more value then. That really helps as a development team grows.",1349049813

Imagine going to investors saying ""we built our product, we even have some customers who've given us some positive feedback and constructive criticism.

It would grind to a halt even on a mid-range PC, not to mention an iPad or a cheap laptop.<p>Still, I really wish that you create a plug-and-play graphics engine for web game developers, that would allow people like me to fulfill their fantasies. :) Wish you all the best!",1324211622

Doom 1 was released 20 years ago.<p>Feature-wise WebGL/GLES2 matches a desktop GPU circa 2004 or so. Doom 3-ish feature set. Performance wise it's a bit behind, but this varies so much from device to device that it makes no sense to take this into a discussion when we're talking about API standards and their features.",1324209917

That's where you go to play music.<p>Spotify is worth installing because it gives me all music in one place. If I had to install one app per title, I would not consider it at all. That is how games are. You have to install each title individually. That makes Spotify much more similar to the browser than it is to installed games.",1324209779

3366475,comment,3366164,3366290,2,0,exDM69,,,">> WebGL is not a poor-man's subset of OpenGL, its the same subset that is supported by most mobile devices (OpenGL ES2.0).<p>WebGL is just that, a poor-man's subset of OpenGL. As is OpenGL ES 2, which is a standard that's deprecating very fast as mobile GPU's pack more and more <i>kick-ass</i>.<p>OpenGL ES standardization efforts are badly left behind the development, as graphics vendors are adding more and more extensions to GLES in their implementations. These extensions tend to be a little stripped down versions of desktop GL features and the worst thing is that they're not quite compatible with desktop GL or even similar extensions form other vendors. Next version of GLES (codename ""Halti"") has to be standardized pretty fast or it will be out of date by the time it comes out.<p>If you want to write high quality 3d games or graphics using GLES2, you will have to use vendor specific extensions and write code specifically for the devices you intend to ship on. If you're doing something very basic, you may get away with using only the features in GLES2, but you'll still have to consider how to match the performance to the wide array of GLES2 conformant devices out there. It also helps if you're a part of a major graphics vendor's developer partnership program, like it or not.<p>WebGL's standardization cycle probably even slower. It took a while for the spec to reach maturity and major browsers implementing it. AFAIK, there's no extension mechanism to gain access to not-yet-standardized features. When the next version of OpenGL ES comes out, how long will it take for it's new features to come available to WebGL? Is the WebGL API even designed for extendability? Who are the industry players willing to contribute their engineering efforts to building WebGL specs and implementations?",1324209722

An i7 is not that small. You would have to shrink things further and further to get a smaller chip with shorter paths in it, which is what new fabrication methods have been about.<p>Obviously this is very difficult.  Sure, chips could be even faster if they were just a few atoms across, but who would expect you to do meaningful computation in that size, or to be able to manufacture that.",1324209683

If Vista sold well and there was mass adoption then MS would have had the free cash flow to aquire Yahoo without having to borrow. If Yahoo next year is at $20 a share, Microsoft may try again.

I want to see how they interact with each other.  I want to see all the other things people do as they work with the software.  I even want to see their paperwork and whatever else is on their desk/vehicle/work area.<p>Developing systems take more than just being Stallman/Turing/Woz.

Less if you invested cash up front and he didn't.<p>What you don't want is to let people have it both ways, collecting a salary as if it were BigCo and getting massive chunks of equity as well.",1209862291

He's very talented and I would like to keep him in the company for as long as possible.<p>My startup is 1 week old and I had already considered in making this employee my partner at the beginning.<p>My question is how much of the company should I share with him? Considering that he is a paid employee who did not contribute any funding into the company, should I still pay him the wage I am paying him now (several dollars above min. wage at this point with 1% profit-sharing) while asking for some cash investment into the company? He is asking for 25% of the equity...<p>Thanks a bunch.",1209861768

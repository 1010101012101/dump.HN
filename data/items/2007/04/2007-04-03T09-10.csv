It also fits my moral code.<p>The site has some great info, but try not using it to hack a broken system - instead, use it just to have the smoothest ride through one of the best experiences our world has to offer.

Distributing CDs seems very 90s AOL, costs quite a bit of money, and doesn't have a great conversion rate.<p>Sorry, rms, if I've come across as too critical -- I'm just trying to ask the questions that need to be asked.  It's a mental workout of sorts.<p>I'm still very excited to hear more about Parakey -- it's about time computers became useful!",1175592630

The new audio files will be 256kbps instead of the current 128kbps - most folks are forgetting this in their analysis of the pricing.<p>And seriously - I think I've been spoiled reading pg articles. It feels like this guy's yelling and spitting on you as you read it, blah.",1175591023

I'm just looking to pay back hosting etc. costs. I agree with the idea that a project should never be finished, and that's what I used to think, but then I read a few hacker news articles about fail early etc., and I realized I was spending way too much time on little features. I went through a bunch of layout changes, and while this one is boring, I think it works.<p>I just added anonymous arguing, so that will help the site get some activity, I think. I don't want to do blackhat stuff/actively SEO it, but only if nothing else works.<p>I bought a Reddit self-serve ad, and I guess I'll see how that works, and I'll start making small comments on political forums or something.",1270940385

My father works for Chrysler, and I have observed that even as they outsource everything they can, the remaining core is intrinsically huge, as there really has to be an entity that is finally responsible for the car. That means that entity has to have a huge testing component. That further means it needs to do its own design. It also really needs to be the one doing the manufacturing, too, even if that is only a ""final assembly"" step.<p>Structuring things so that this wouldn't be necessary anywhere in the economy is probably not currently practical.

Really?\n2) Hacker News posters are about as unrepresentative a sample as you can get.<p>> And I'm fine with that, just as long as you also understand it's unhygienic and, after being brought up to your attention, selfish (I'm comfortable) and inconsiderate (live with it).<p>How unhygienic is it when compared with the conditions of the rest of the world around you that you interact with (voluntarily or otherwise) day by day?  I don't know.  I suspect you (and the blog poster) don't either.  It may very well be that -- as usual -- humans are just really bad at risk analysis and stuff-from-feet just really isn't a big deal.<p>Regardless, it's been a week or so since this post, and I've been somewhat-consciously more aware of the situations where I put up my feet.  I noticed that I never put my feet up on desks (that's kinda uncomfortable; I tried it [shoeless] out of curiosity), and never on conference tables (ditto?).  My favorite kind of place to put up my feet is on one of the lower supports <i>under</i> a table.  So it appears in general I avoid putting my feet up on the actual surface of things where people might put food, or put their hands, or rest their heads, etc.<p>Having said that, I put my feet on top of my coffee table in my living room all the time.  But I never have my shoes on in my apartment, so at least that's something.<p>Still, though, I think the obsession some people have with ""public hygiene"" is a bit excessive.  Being conscious of personal hygiene is great, but the world is a dirty, gross, germ-ridden place.  Get used to it, or go around in a giant hamster ball.<p>On a side note, I noticed that quite a few posts here didn't present hygiene arguments.  Many were from people of Indian or Middle-Eastern cultures where showing someone your feet is considered rude (a fact I was not aware of; thanks to HN for teaching me something new).  Now, personally, knowing that, I would certainly avoid putting my feet up in front of people who may be culturally sensitive to that sort of thing.  But, directed at people of those cultures: you're (presumably) in the US, or a place where your culture is not the dominant one.  You have to understand that other cultures are different from yours, and people may not know that things they find innocuous will offend you.  The onus is on <i>you</i> to be accommodating toward them, not the other way around.  Just as when they are in your country, they should be sensitive of your culture.",1270939623

I think technologically speaking, a major breakthrough was definitely the internet and mobile communication.<p>However, I would like to say something about the current generation. I believe the reason they are whiners is maybe because many youngsters in the west are facing the perspective of not being better off financially than the generation of their parents, putting lots of pressure upon them.<p>I think many people (at least here in Europe) are skeptical of technology because they perceive globalization, outsourcing, technological advancement and increasing competition as interlinked factors, which do not necessarily improve their quality of life, but rather present them with additional unknowns.<p>Again speaking for Europe, technology would be more widely accepted and hopefully appreciated, if there was a way to give the current generation more certainty that there will be enough water to flow all boats.",1270939610

Extrapolating on the headline, it sounds like Microsoft's pipes are full of Xbox exclusive titles. Preferring exclusives seems like a reasonable general guideline when there are simply too many games worth investing in. This is especially true for simultaneous development of cross-platform games.

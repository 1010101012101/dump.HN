5117560,comment,5098869,5106212,1,0,zzzeek,,,"Particularly troubling is the lack of critical analysis that can be found regarding Kirsch's book.  Googling for it reveals tons of links from various magazines and news sites with sensationalistic headlines, feeding into an emotion that is easy to tap, which is the discomfort many people have with the entire concept of antidepressants.   ""Going on antidepressants?  Read this first!"" that kind of thing.<p>As for a formally written challenge to Kirsch, I could only find this times editorial <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/opinion/sunday/10antidepressants.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/opinion/sunday/10antidepre...</a> which makes the argument that someone in my position has already suspected, that the studies being cited are flawed - that it is exceedingly difficult to identify bona-fide ""mildly or moderately depressed"" people to participate in a study, not to mention that measuring depression is a completely subjective affair:<p>>  Often subjects who dont really have depression are included  and (no surprise) weeks down the road they are not depressed. People may exaggerate their symptoms to get free care or incentive payments offered in trials. Other, perfectly honest subjects participate when they are at their worst and then spontaneously return to their usual, lower, level of depression.<p>Without an objective means of measuring depression, measuring the effect of drugs objectively is not straightforward.<p>Kirsch has, like everyone else, approached this study with a definite bias, a career based on raising the prominence of the placebo affect.    I'm not sure you can read a few books and declare ""the truth"" as case closed here, all ideas are subject to challenge.   In this case I think there's a lack of interest in challenging this idea as the drug companies are obviously doing quite well (and I am no fan of drug companies) and probably don't want to raise more attention to it.   It's an extraordinary claim that the millions of people who insist that SSRIs are very effective for them are being deceived en-masse, and one under-critiqued meta-study might not be enough to prove that claim.<p>Interesting comment on that article as well:<p>>  ""Papers showing that antidepressants work had found their way into print; unfavorable findings had not."" The point is, that there are any number of ways a clinical trial can be run such that an ""effective"" drug will not be able to demonstrate a level of statistical significance. While there is no way you can run a clinical trial so that an ""ineffective"" drug will demonstrate a level of statistical significance. If you run nine clinical trials that fail to show a drug is active, and one clinical trial that shows that it is active; when presented with this kind of data, most people in the general public would wrongly conclude that the drug is not active. In fact, the correct conclusion is that the drug is active. That is why it is the job of qualified experts at the FDA, and not the public, to examine the information generated from clinical trials and pass judgment as to whether or not a drug has been proved to be ""safe and effective"".<p>If it were possible to make an ineffective drug demonstrate a level of statistical significance, then we'd have tons of studies proving the efficacy of homeopathy, wouldn't we ?",1359147065

However, writing a detailed spec upfront will not ensure that software will do what it needs to do or that it does that stably. Not at all!<p>A simple piece of code can already amount to more complexity then a skyscraper. I think that most developers can agree that even when meticulously thinking upfront about what to make and how it should function, when a system is actually coded, new, unforeseen situations arise, always. This is without any exception. This simply arises from the fact that software systems become too complex for us to oversee fast. Especially how processing by these systems evolve over time is difficult to grasp.<p>Only in special cases you want to do some sort of formal specification to proof that something works, e.g. in the case of an algorithm. In all the other 99% of the cases writing good software is mostly about iterating and communicating <i></i>a lot<i></i>, with co-developers and stakeholders: In each small iteration we should think, discuss, code and assess.<p>Last, I do think that at least <i></i>after<i></i> the code has stabilized its functions/classes/methods/APIs needs to be documented such that it becomes easier for developers to fix, change or extend a system in the future.",1359146640

There are a few technical things at issue.<p>Again, I agree this is broken. My only point is that saying things are ""fraud"" is harder than I think you expect.<p>The problem is that saying ""I want X% return with Y risk, show me suitable investments"" introduces two problems. The first is that risk is not easily quantifiable[1] and also that there are likely many things that are plausibly suitable for that requirement.<p>If you are dealing with a salesperson, they are required only to present stuff that has a reasonable likelihood of meeting your goals.<p>If they're working with someone who is a fiduciary, that fiduciary is required to do the extra analysis, but many people are not lucky enough to work with folks who are held to that higher standard.<p>In my view, every consumer when transacting with every salesperson should use their own judgment to make sure that the products they are being sold are sensible and suitable for them.<p>Failing to do that -- to just walk into a store and buy what the salesperson (not your personal shopper or your sister or someone who actually cares) says is best -- is just a bad idea.<p>I hope that adds some clarity as to where I'm coming from.<p>[1]Quanta exist, but are not comprehensively descriptive. Any metric will not comprehensively describe risk, especially because there are behavioral factors (your own changing attitude towards risk over time) that need to be incorporated into a thoughtful assessment.",1359145966

There are still a number of issues when applying this method to mechanical design.<p>A naive implementation can produce structures that are either impossible to fabricate or insanely complex and expensive.<p>It is easy to also optimize away safety factors.  The pictured truss might be optimal under ideal conditions yet fail in spectacular ways if even a small crack or a bad weld develops somewhere.  Remember, rust never sleeps.  There's also the case of material quality and consistency (is all aluminum equal?).<p>One application that was a lot of fun to work on was the evolution of an optimal cooling solution for a very high power (1500W) LED array.  I evolved the solution using what I am going to dare and call a manual-GA approach.<p>All of the mechanical modeling was done using SolidWorks and FlowWorks/SolidFlow FEA package.  The mechanical model was designed to be parametrically controlled from extensive geometry tables that could be edited with MS Excel (which made it so much simpler).  The approach was to run reasonably realistic (meaning, close to what you could actually fabricate) structures.  Each structure took 16 to 18 hours to run.  Using multiple cores and machines we could get a set of them done overnight for evaluation the following morning.<p>The evaluation function consisted of agreed-upon parameters that came out of the FEA simulation: delta T, max and min temperatures, thermal uniformity, etc.  These were used to calculate a score for each structure.<p>Once enough data (enough variants or ""chromosomes"" if you will) accumulated, the manual ""natural selection"", ""reproduction"" and ""random mutation"" steps would take place.<p>Over a period of about eight months this work produces some really interesting, unexpected and, I think, innovative approaches to the problem.<p>I learned a lot by taking this approach.  I also learned just how hard it would be to fully automate such a project.  I am not necessarily speaking about the tools involved as much as the need to encode manufacturing knowledge into a system such that it autom-magically evolve objects one can actually construct.",1359145144

Here is a breakdown of what we've tried.<p>1) Subversion/Git. The binary files are huge and smaller incremental changes bloat the SVN repo size when you commit them back in. This makes backing up the repo an issue. Designers tend to have issues with the concepts of SVN and is not intuitive the their workflow. When a conflict happens its usually a bit of a mess.<p>2) Cloud services. We've tried storing files on the cloud and have them sync.

All this effectively does is uses a specific function name instead of a randomly generated one, so that it matches up with the function returned from the server in the response.",1359144306

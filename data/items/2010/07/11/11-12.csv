1505347,comment,1505017,1505334,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"That doesn't make any sense.<p>1. The article described specific research into creativity that does suggest that it can be taught, but you're completely ignoring the content of the article.<p>2. We live in a global economy now. A firm in the U.S. can design a product which is manufactured in another country. This would negatively affect U.S. manufacturing output, but would not have any impact on ""creativity"" as you describe it.<p>3. I have to disagree with pretty much every single statement you're making here. Creativity <i>can</i> be spontaneous -- any bored kid in a school class with a pencil and a paper will show you that. Loss of industrial knowledge <i>does not</i> mean there is ""less and less left to be taught to people"" -- that's completely uncorrelated, because industrial knowledge isn't the only form of knowledge available to a modern society. Whether or not you ""buy"" the ""fairy tales"", the interesting parts of this article <i>do</i> suggest that abstract creativity can be taught, and those suggestions are based on quite a lot of research -- versus your simple assertion that it's not true because it doesn't fit into your industrial-complex worldview.<p>And so on. You're pushing some kind of agenda and it's not even self-consistent.",1278847027

Humanity has proven time and time again that when there is a reason to suspect somebody absconded with large sums of money, they probably did. I have no opinion on the matter, but what could make a more effective cover story for vanishing than a believable 'Big Brother wanted to find me'?",1278847026

And that authentication needs to be kept confidential.<p>The result is that there's no way around a 'trusted' provider who signs releases, and that will inherently be a personality like Assange.<p>Simply relying on a reddit-style submission method would lead to a worse form of reddit.  Currently you can evaluate whether or not you 'trust' content submitted to reddit by looking at the site hosting it (is the content from the NYT or a random blog?).  For a wikileaks-reddit, all submissions would have to be anonymous, and you'd have no idea what is a real leak or not.",1278846736

What BASIC interpreters did tend to do well was allow you to write a few lines, then run it and have it do what you said.<p>To answer the question then - I think any non-compiled language would be fine. I think things like Python is probably the best, as you're not required to program in an OO style, or in a functional style - just write lines, and they'll work.<p>Once the kids are interested and know a bit about how programming, sure, then teach them proper style. The important part is getting them to realise how to formulate thoughts in a structured manner - once you've done that, forming them in a different structure doesn't seem too hard.",1278846474

It seems like there are plenty of alternatives to a vulnerable website (such as Freenet).<p>In that sense Assange role would be reduced to authenticating and releasing, and wouldn't have a lot of control over the publishing side of things.

Of course, it is great to foster it, yet, with loss of industrial knowledge, less and less is left to be taught to people. I do not buy fairy tales that there is abstract creativity you can teach people - there is engineering, artistic, scientific ""creativities"". One of important sources of creativity come from successful examples of its implementation by other people, and the more industrial you are the more way to use your creativity and get feedback from real, tangible, physical world.<p>And here is my answer - you want be more creative in engineering creativity increase you industry output.",1278846159

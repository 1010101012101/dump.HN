Sure if you&#x27;re a 20-something with no kids/life and only care about your startup, you can code 24/7.  But many of us don&#x27;t fit into this stereotypical startup-founder box that PG and others have created.<p>Some of us have kids, some have partners, some have ... a life!<p>Does PG really want a bunch of code obsessed, single minded founders with no hobbies or life outside of their startup?  I can&#x27;t imagine he does, and as a result he should revise some of his advice.<p>If PG is looking to make a quick buck, churn and burn founders than it all makes sense.

It sounds like a soldier being forced to go to battle crying for the family he leaves behind, where in fact it&#x27;s entirely his own choices. And if it&#x27;s some sort of an internal torment, being torn between two passions that conflict with one another, then I would suggest he gets a grip and decide which sacrifices he wants to make and which he doesn&#x27;t and find the right balance.<p>It&#x27;s probably my first negative comment on HN, but as a new father of a 6 months son, and a co-founder of a startup, this just irritates me. I spend 2-3 days per week working from home, being able to take a lunch break with my wife, or change nappies for my son or feed him in the morning before hacking away. I catch up later at night when he sleeps, but generally manage my time well between those two. I&#x27;m not a perfect father and not the most successful entrepreneur, but these are the choices I made and the challenges I face. I think it&#x27;s important for my son that I&#x27;m going to be around, but also that he has a father that is proud of his work and enjoys what he does.",1400684315

If it&#x27;s true that repayments will be in USD, then it logically follows that the 200k BTC will be liquidated into USD, which will then be distributed evenly among debtees.<p>Liquidating 200k BTC would be quite a sight to behold.  For example, there are only 18k BTC of orders on Bitstamp right now: <a href=""http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/bitstampUSD_depth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/bitstampUSD_depth.html</a><p>... meaning, selling 200k BTC would blow through the entire order book eleven times over.  I have no idea how the market would react to that.  I&#x27;m sure bitcoin would survive it, just like it&#x27;s survived every other disaster, but it will be quite the rollercoaster.<p>The reason I say the 200k BTC would be sold off if the repayments are all in USD is because, if I remember correctly, Mt. Gox had almost no cash when it shut down.  Most of its cash had been seized by the US government long ago. So if Mt. Gox are going to repay anything of significance, then it seems like those 200k BTC will be sold off.  What&#x27;s the alternative?  Those 200k BTC have to wind up <i>somewhere</i>.  I know nothing of Japan&#x27;s legal system, but the alternatives seem to be &quot;either the government ends up keeping the coins, or the coins are redistributed to Mt. Gox debtees, or the coins are all sold off and the proceeds are distributed to Mt. Gox debtees.&quot;<p>Anyone have any theories about what will happen to the coins?",1400684023

I am so glad I did it then.<p>Another way to read this post, if you are young, is as a warning - you may think it is scary or hard to take risks now, but go for it.   When you have children, it will be much, much harder.   Every minute you are working, you will feel torn that you aren&#x27;t with your kids, and every minute you are with your kids, you will feel torn that you aren&#x27;t working (to provide for them).

I now realize that my 20s (and early 30s) were an investment for a vastly better reward - the time and financial freedom to be with my family in my late 30s/early 40s when my children are young.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the outcome of those choices, and I didn&#x27;t really see it coming, because I did not understand the depth of feeling I would have for my children.<p>But for the young people out there in their 20s - your opportunity cost will never be lower.

The continuity of libraries and frameworks and the &quot;usefulness&quot; of a language are <i>IMPORTANT</i> but usually these trade-offs are discounted versus &quot;coolness&quot; by those comparing the frameworks.  If you&#x27;re focusing on getting something accomplished, chasing every new and improved library, framework and architectural pattern only does one thing - it keeps you from ever delving deeply enough into one technology stack to truly become an expert.  Pragmatism and zealotry don&#x27;t mix.<p>I should have also stated in my comment above that I almost gave up on Enterprise Java back in the J2EE 1.4 days (2005-2007 if I recall correctly).  When you have to create multiple Java files for every EJB (mostly Entity and Stateless Session beans) and edit XML deployment descriptors (many times one deployment descriptor for each supported application server), Java programming feels as tedious as many people describe.<p>The contrast with JavaEE 6/7 is amazing - the technologies that are encompassed in each of the specifications tend to follow the same pattern.  Write a POJO and add annotations.  For instance, if you need a business method that consumes messages from a message queue and processes them, that&#x27;s one (short) Java file with some annotations.  For a more complicated example, if you have a database table and want to expose the records via a RESTful interface, here&#x27;s what you&#x27;d have to write six (small) files as follows:<p>- One entity bean with fields annotated for the ORM as well as accessors and mutators.<p>- One stateless session bean with your business methods - in this case providing CRUD operations against the entity bean (using a PersistenceContext from JPA)<p>- One JAX-RS annotated class to provide the RESTful API&#x27;s methods (again an annotated POJO).<p>- One Application class (with very few lines of code - it activates JAX-RS).<p>- One persistence.xml file to define a datasource.<p>- One (empty) beans.xml file to activate CDI.<p>If you stick with the JavaEE annotations and configuration files, there are some real benefits to this structure:<p>- The ORM&#x27;s entities and configuration are database agnostic ... the same WAR file could be deployed against your MySQL servers, Oracle (for those who have money to burn) or PostgreSQL.<p>- The application will run on any JavaEE compliant application server.  Deploy the file to Glassfish, Wildfly, JBoss EAP or even WebLogic (for those who have money to burn).<p>- The ORM will cache entities (and can be configured to use a second-level cache when it&#x27;s prudent).  When you start caching database rows, you have to be careful and there may be tuning involved.<p>- The Application Server will create pools of each of the objects that will be used so that it&#x27;s not creating and destroying objects over and over again.  This is a huge performance gain for servers with a lot of request-scoped web transactions that use stateless session beans for business logic.<p>There are also ways to create enterprise Java applications that are a little more light-weight (though today&#x27;s Application Servers have lost a lot of their girth).  If you simply use a servlet container you can still use JSF which has a better templating engine that JSP.  You can add CDI by including the library and a little bit of bootstrap code.  Application servers like Apache TommEE start with Tomcat and add libraries as needed.<p>It also occurs to me that the &quot;experimental phase&quot; you&#x27;re embarking on could be leveraged to be both crowd-sourced and open-source.  Since you&#x27;re starting from scratch with each of these technologies, wouldn&#x27;t it be interesting to have a complete newbie and an expert produce the same application using each of the surviving frameworks?<p>If you publish a light-weight specification for your test project and open a Github project with each framework&#x27;s implementation in a sub-directory, I&#x27;d be really curious to see what efficiencies and problems were experienced with each implementation.  It would also give you a way of comparing your implementations to others.",1400683429

In Clojure, as well as in most other lisps, this:<p>&#x27;(1 2 3)<p>constructs a value of type <i>list</i>, while this:<p>[1 2 3]<p>constructs a value of type vector.<p>They are not the same and you cannot say that one somehow becomes the other. And from what I remember Clojure <i>does</i> have a list data-type and it still <i>needs</i> to be quoted, except for empty list literal, (), which is self-evaluating.<p>So, in Clojure you need to quote your lists, exactly like in many other Lisps, and you have literals for other data structures, exactly like in many other Lisps ([] in Elisp, #() in Racket, CL covered by lispm). But of course Clojure is so much more readable because it has so few parentheses in comparison... to Java, I suppose.",1400681914

I think you&#x27;ll have a more polished look by having the background be white with a more neutral color palette.<p>For the extension itself: I like that it doesn&#x27;t call out for information unless called upon, but if I ask for information about a site, I see no reason for you to have to collect the full URL and POST it to /track.  That could lead to unexpected data leakage (as some URLs could be sensitive).  You should probably get those API calls over to using HTTPS as well.<p>Also with every lookup, my console gets the log message &quot;asdf&quot;, which is kind of weird.  One thing I noticed is that the extension is pretty slow to get information.  It appears it calls out for each item individually, and this leads to seven unique calls to your API that could be condensed into one request / response.  If an API call fails with a 500 error, the entire stacktrace is dumped to the user.  You&#x27;ll want to disable debugging mode in your Express app to ensure that doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Since these APIs are public, you might want to consider rate limiting by IP, or you might find that your extension isn&#x27;t the only consumer of them.  A free and open WHOIS or Geolocation API that responds with JSON could be abused by other app developers, and having that already around moves the cost from them to you.",1400681882

Your life should be what you do when you are not working - not the other way around.<p>Many years ago, I was working 80+ hour weeks, week after week, and my daughter was very young. Consistently, I would not even SEE her from Thursday morning until Saturday afternoon.<p>I burned out on that job. I felt shell-shocked. I went to dinner with my wife and realized that we had grown apart. I hated that. I hated missing my daughter growing up.<p>I hated that my daily thoughts were about work, what was happening with work, and that my interactions with my coworkers had overridden my interaction with my family.<p>So I decided that my life would revolve around my family, and who I was outside of work, not the other way around. Over the years I have changed jobs, started companies, had wild success, had some failures, but through it all I felt even-keel because it all felt like my LIFE was the same. The cubicles, the coworkers, the employees, those all change but my wife and daughter, the life we share, that has been constant. I actually don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve changed jobs at all even though in reality I&#x27;ve worked at about 6 different places and started 2 companies.<p>Don&#x27;t think that work and success will make it alright in the end. It won&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t believe people who think you are slacking because you aren&#x27;t working 100 hours a week. Those people aren&#x27;t executing efficiently.

Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.&quot;<p>and this:<p>&quot;Combine all these multipliers, and I&#x27;m claiming you could be 36 times more productive than you&#x27;re expected to be in a random corporate job.&quot;<p>and the reasons why we might want to do a startup:<p>&quot;For example, one way to make a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years. You do tend to get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you can&#x27;t evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a><p>That essay can be read both as an inspiration and as a warning. On the positive side, it is good to realize how much you can achieve in a few short years. On the negative side, you must be wholly focused on one thing during those few short years. The rest of your life needs to put on hold.<p>A personal anecdote: I am a bit of a news junkie, and I typically spend an hour or two a day reading the news, but when I had my own startup, I gave up reading the news. For the years 2003 to 2004, and for most of 2006, I rarely read the news. That was a huge change of personal habits for me. But avoiding the news was important for me to stay focused.

7778260,comment,7777831,7777831,28,0,sillysaurus3,,,"The takeaway, if you had any bitcoin in Mt. Gox when it fell:<p>You won&#x27;t receive any repayment until Feb 2015 at the earliest.<p>Important note: you must fill out a form claiming your debt in order to be considered for repayment in Feb 2015, i.e. as an Mt. Gox debtee, you are required to manually inform them (via their form) of how much money you&#x27;re owed, otherwise you&#x27;ll receive nothing.  The form can&#x27;t be filled out yet, because they haven&#x27;t released it, but presumably they&#x27;ll post it on mtgox.com sometime in the upcoming months, so make a mental note to keep your eyes open for it and fill it out whenever it&#x27;s posted.  If you haven&#x27;t sent in the form by Nov 2014 then it sounds like you&#x27;re guaranteed to get nothing.<p>It also seems fairly likely that you won&#x27;t recover much of your money.  That&#x27;s just speculation on my part (and I would love to be wrong about it) but it seems like it&#x27;s time to make peace with the idea that you probably won&#x27;t be seeing >75% of your money ever again.<p>That said, Mt. Gox recently found 200,000 BTC that they had somehow lost track of: <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/21/us-bitcoin-mtgox-wallet-idUSBREA2K05N20140321"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/21/us-bitcoin-mtgox-w...</a><p>... so those 200,000 BTC may be distributed among creditors.  Since Mt. Gox&#x27;s total bitcoin debt has been quoted at around 750,000 BTC, that would mean in an ideal world you&#x27;ll eventually receive 26.6% of however many bitcoins you had at the time of Mt. Gox&#x27;s shutdown.<p>But the world isn&#x27;t ideal.  It&#x27;s unclear how such a repayment scheme would work in practice.  For example, how will Mt. Gox repay debtees who are owed USD/EUR/AUD/etc, not bitcoin?  E.g. let&#x27;s say someone&#x27;s Mt. Gox account balance was 3.25 BTC and $3,132.  How would Mt. Gox&#x27;s 200,000 BTC be fairly distributed in that situation?  Would that $3,132 debt be converted into BTC debt?  Or will Mt. Gox sell some of that 200k BTC in order to get US dollars, which are then repaid to that $3,132 debtee?  And if all US/EUR/AUD/etc debts will be converted into BTC debts for purposes of repayment, what prices will they use for the actual conversion?  (That is, how many BTC per how many dollars of debt?)  Will they use current bitcoin market value for the conversion (which is currently $494/BTC) so that $3,132 would be equivalent to 6.34 BTC?  Or will they use the value of bitcoin when Mt. Gox shut down operations?<p>What if they decide the best way to proceed is by selling off all 200k BTC for US/EUR/AUD/etc, which is then distributed among debtees? It&#x27;s their decision; it seems like that scenario isn&#x27;t impossible.   You can imagine how a firesale of 200k bitcoins would completely annihilate BTC&#x27;s market value.  Of course, it&#x27;s unlikely that whoever is in charge of Mt. Gox&#x27;s assets would be that shortsighted, but given that bitcoin is completely new to most legal systems, who knows?<p>The point here is that your money&#x27;s fate is up to someone else.  Your money stopped being your money the moment you deposited it into Mt. Gox, or Coinbase, or any other third party.  And now that Mt. Gox has collapsed and taken your money with it, it&#x27;s probably best to accept that all of your money is 100% gone and never coming back, because that way when Feb 2015 rolls around you might be pleasantly surprised if Mt. Gox happens to repay you some small percentage of your holdings.  (A pleasant surprise is much nicer than a sore disappointment, which is why I recommend pretending all your money is gone.  Worst case: all your money is gone.  Best case: some of it comes back to you via carrier pigeon.  Actually, that would be the Awesome case.)<p>So let this be a lesson about the dangers of trusting a third party with your money, unless that third party is insured by a government in the event of disaster.",1400681159

In Common Lisp, `defun` takes on the general form of the lambda:<p><pre><code>     lambda  (x)(+ x 1)\n     defun f (x)(+ x 1)\n</code></pre>\nSyntactically `(x)` looks like it should be evaluated, but isn&#x27;t because there are special rules for special forms, and each special form can have it&#x27;s own rules:<p><pre><code>    let ((x 7)(y 3))\n        (+ x y)\n</code></pre>\nis a whole `nother set of syntactical rules which are even more in conflict with normal rules of evaluation.<p>Scheme, keeps the let and uses a syntax for `define` that mimics the function call rather than the lambda.<p><pre><code>     define (f x) (+ x 1)\n     f 1\n</code></pre>\nIn Clojure the use of a vector for `defn` arguments follows it&#x27;s formal lambda form like Common Lisp and is very much consistent with Clojure&#x27;s rules for evaluation.<p><pre><code>    fn     [x] (+ x 1)\n    defn f [x] (+ x 1)\n</code></pre>\nLikewise Clojure&#x27;s `let` syntax does not require wetware parsing to recognize what gets evaluated and what doesn&#x27;t.<p><pre><code>    let [x 1\n         y 3]\n      (+ x y)\n</code></pre>\nWhat I am appreciating about Clojure as a language is that it prunes some historic artifacts from the Lisp family tree. Raw memory allocation with `cons` made sense when human memory could retain more facts than a computer&#x27;s fast memory. This meant it was easy to think of useful programs too big to fit in memory. That&#x27;s distinctly harder today where doubling fast memory is less than $300 for the vast majority of computers.<p>Lisp was developed as a direct improvement over assembly. Clojure was developed as a direct improvement over Java over C++ over C over assembly. It&#x27;s a rethinking of what a Lisp needs (when backwards compatibility is ignored).

Most of us could earn enough money to support our family comfortably in a relatively regular 9 - 5 job. We might not be personally as satisfied and we might not be as financially well off, but we can choose one possible version of our life over another.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely fair to say that you have to balance the needs of being a &quot;good&quot; father (which let&#x27;s remember is a subjective term in many ways), against your own personal needs (and indeed the needs of your partner, the rest of your family and so on), but most people reading this board are fortunate enough that there genuinely is an element of choice.<p>No-one should tell you that working long hours so your child need never go without (or so you&#x27;re personally happy and the time you spend with them you do so without resentment) is better or worse than coaching their sports team and being there every bath time, but whatever you decide to do, I think the most important thing is to accept that you&#x27;re doing it because you made a conscious decision - ultimately that&#x27;s going to be the only way you&#x27;ll be at peace with it.<p>And if you haven&#x27;t made a conscious decision, the for heavens&#x27; sake sit down with your other half and do so. Of all the outcomes, doing what you&#x27;re doing without thinking about what you want and what works best for your family maybe the only truly bad one.",1400680900

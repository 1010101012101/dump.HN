8868436,comment,8868035,8868387,0,0,Implicated,,,"> You have to have tasks all lined up<p>I rarely see this mentioned, but I cannot agree more. In my experience with Modafinil, if I had tasks lined up before the effects took hold, I was golden and would obliterate that to-do list/etc. But if I were left with &#x27;nothing to do&#x27;, it was just like you described...the rabbit hole just got deeper.<p>So many people have had wildly different experiences with modaf (as with any drug really)...for me it&#x27;s biggest positive was that context switching, mentally, became nearly &#x27;free&#x27;. Generally my biggest hurdle in completing tasks through the day is when I finish with one task in one context and am tasked with unloading all of that information and jumping into something new...this is where I procrastinate, or generally just struggle with maintaining pace. While taking modafinil that penalty was seemingly non-existent. I was able to bounce from problem to problem, project to project with no mental penalty or friction. Quite amazing really.<p>Though I generally just don&#x27;t find the sensation while taking them enjoyable or even worth it in many cases...increased heart rate makes me and my hands sweat (and smell), tight jaw and general inability to just &#x27;relax&#x27;. I bought 60 nearly two years ago and have taken maybe 10 of them. I&#x27;m also a contractor who doesn&#x27;t work under any or much stress/pressure, which may have something to do with my apathy towards their positive effects.<p>To each their own, I can absolutely see how this drug has and can change people&#x27;s lives.",1420934006

Rob Pike, speaking on Go&#x27;s behalf, mentioned that while &quot;systems programming&quot; was originally advertised as a goal of Go, it has since been dropped from the list, due to the expectations that others have when they read that compared to the intent of the drivers of the language.

People often compare it to Go because Go is a simple, popular reference that many people understand, and hence can be compared against in a way that is meaningful to a lot of people.  There are a lot of similarities, as well as a lot of differences, making for lively conversations filled with tangents on various preferences and experiences.  In short, you can have a good conversation when making such comparisons.  You can compare it against tomatoes, too, but the shared ground isn&#x27;t huge, and analogies must be far more complex to derive meaning, and the participants need far deeper mental stacks to make ANY progress that relates to the original intent when the tangents veer far from the domain of programming language implementation or usage.",1420933345

You can go so far as to have your own type + mapping for e.g. a report, which sources data from another type and transforms it: <a href=""http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-transform.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/referenc...</a><p>- This covers both why the schema can&#x27;t, by nature, be dynamic (so the argument of &quot;schema-less / dynamic schema&quot; is BS in practice IMO), as well as how to get data out from one index an into another (e.g. your &quot;report&quot; index which does scripted transformation).<p>- Another idea would be to use the scripting module to write a custom &quot;view&quot;: <a href=""http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/referenc...</a><p>- You can use Groovy, mvel, JS, or Python for scripts.

One more thing I&#x27;d do, as an addendum (or even separate) to the contract, I&#x27;d  have a one page written/signed document that points out web scrapers are useful but fragile when sites change (give the reasons etc).  That should help keep you pretty safe.<p>As for payment, try not to take a credit card or paypal, get a physical check, ACH or wire transfer.  As for taxes, most places will require you to provide a W9 which they will then use to report what they paid you to the IRS (although sometimes when the fees are low they don&#x27;t bother).  In the end even if they don&#x27;t, just report it on your taxes as additional income and keep a copy of your invoice and record of payment, including any fees or costs you incurred on the project and to get paid.  This way you can get your deductions but also have proof.",1420933234

Since sleep deprivation is something that has twice almost killed me (or others) while operating a vehicle, I decided to get that prescription and deal with the problem rather than continue to be unsafe.<p>What I can say is this: Modafinil works.  The effect is very subtle but it very clearly eliminates what might be termed &quot;sleep pressure&quot; or the effect of the body trying to FORCE you to sleep.  It doesn&#x27;t actually do anything for your sleep REQUIREMENT.<p>One nice thing about Modafinil: you can sleep on it.  If you take a pill and then have an opportunity to sleep, you can.

That kind of on-/off cycle is designed to minimize any side effects and keep me from using it to replace sleep.<p>On another note: the US special operations community has been using Modafinil (along with other stimulant drugs) to help solidiers/sailors/marines/airmen to overcome the effects of extended sleep deprivation.  I&#x27;ve confirmed this directly with members of those communities and their experience mirrors mine.

Early versions of the language had a lot of built-in features, but eventually, the core language was powerful enough to move them out.<p>Ironically, channels are a great example of this. Rust used to have a channel keyword, and the language used to reason about them directly, but nowadays, the type system is strong enough that they (and in fact, all of I/O) is just a library, yet just as safe.<p>Rust also has strong enough guarantees that channels aren&#x27;t always as necessary as they might be in other languages.

I am quite a clumsy person at the best of times, but I&#x27;ve also noticed that my co-ordination seems to be adversely effected (poor judgement of space, etc) although my reaction times do seem to improve (I&#x27;ve surprised myself sometimes catching falling objects that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d never catch if I hadn&#x27;t taken Modafinil). I haven&#x27;t seen this effect documented anywhere though.",1420931329

How about first class support for writing a GUI application?<p>Though I don&#x27;t think GUIs need to be a primary focus, there are some useful projects already. The rgtk library [1] is the best so far. It is the first Rust project I contributed to. It is currently broken due to the changes in the language, but that should be fixed relatively soon. GTK is more natural to interface with than Qt or WxWidgets because it is written in C.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/jeremyletang/rgtk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jeremyletang/rgtk</a>",1420930865

The justifiability of these up until now is a huge reason why governments and organized crime have been able to buy the keys to our servers and personal machines.  We are going to be able to replace ubiquitous, critical, buggy code with something that will significantly increase the costs of finding and exploiting RCE vulnerabilities.

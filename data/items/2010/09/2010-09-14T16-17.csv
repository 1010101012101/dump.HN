They don't give you any cheaper service.<p>And, when I went to replace a Nokia POS that died 3 days after warranty, I discovered that Verizon even subsidizes their <i>prepaid</i> phones: you can get an LG VX5600 for $40 <i>with new service</i>, but to replace the Nokia with the existing account, they wanted $200.  (Allegedly, they ""don't sell"" the Nokia in question as a prepaid, and thus couldn't offer a direct replacement; which raises the question of why phones they ""don't sell"" come with their branding and work on their network.)",1284483539

Birth order is an easy way to show that you're twice as likely to get a boy and a girl as you are to get two boys.  But you can ignore birth order and say instead ""let k be a binomially distributed random variable with n=2 and p=1/2.  If you know k>=1 what is p(k=2)?"". Then the answer is a straight comparison of p(k=2) to p(k=1), where we note that '2 choose 1' is 2, and '2 choose 2' is 1.  Note that ordering per se isn't entering into this, but to someone without probability background, it's a bit obtuse. Describing the probability space in terms of birth order is not strictly necessary but helps a lot of people grasp the concept.",1284483297

Someone should change it: ""Matt Mireles, Founder & CEO of SpeakerText - If it wasn't for Adopt A Hacker, I would've had to sleep with normals!"" Umm... no.<p>And is that a mac or mac plus?

Leave out the lame looking ""I look way too cool"" developer sitting in the chair- in fact, leave out the chair; you might offend someone with your chair pick.<p>Also, one of the reasons New York doesn't have developers I think is that New York is about having everything, and developers are about creating everything. If you can focus on the part of NYC that inspires creative, controlling types, you'll have an easier time getting them to come.<p>Hosting them on your couch seems desperate, doesn't it?

1691237,comment,1690901,1690901,0,0,mdasen,,,"It could be a number of things.<p>Right now, there's a danger that people start thinking of Facebook as the company that's good for status updates and photos.  That might prove to be a long term facet of our lives, but it could also prove to be fleeting.  Another example of this could be users thinking of Google as that search company and ignoring the company's attempts at other products.  There's lots of ways to take social software, but there's a potential that people will popularly think of Facebook as the status message and friend-tagged photo company.<p>Facebook's barrier to entry (its closed social graph) is both its strongest asset and its greatest weakness.  A barrier to entry like this means that most of your competition is gone.  You can get used to having very limited, if any, competition because if someone's 20% or 50% better than you are, the barrier to entry slaps them down and maybe you even buy them and incorporate them into you on the cheap.  But then someone comes along who is a genius and changes things and shoots the moon.  A bit of a comparison here could be Microsoft.  Apple was weak for a long time.  The Win32 API was a huge barrier to entry.  Then a lot of forces conspired to really break Microsoft.  The rise of the platform-independent web (with Google, Apple, Mozilla, open-source, and others), Apple's resurgence (where they took Microsoft by surprise on handhelds and might have even sent Windows Mobile to the annals of history), and just the changing landscape.  I mean, I remember a time when I thought my Mac would always feel like an also-ran platform unless Microsoft was forced to open up the Win32 API.  Nowadays, I don't think any of us Mac users feel like we're on an also-ran platform (at least not in the way it felt years ago).<p>People's tastes might change.  Right now, people want a connected, low-privacy social graph.  In 10 years, we might feel different.  People's preferences change.<p>Facebook might become generationally limited.  A lot of us got on Facebook in college.  I remember when you could list your courses and find people in your classes.  Some non-Facebook company might hit critical mass in a different generation of users who might see Facebook as lame because their parents are on it.<p>Those are a few that came to my mind.  I'm not saying that Facebook can't rise to the challenges.  They've shown themselves to be quite an adept company.  However, it's hard to predict the future and social networking is something that everyone seems to be gunning for.  Others are trying to out-maneuver Facebook and users can be fickle.",1284483080

We had Zeo 'hacked' last fall - and decided to embrace the trend.  We hired the hacker - a Cornell student - on as an intern and had him help us write libraries to open up the platform.  The Zeo Raw Data Library is in beta now - check out more details here:<p><a href=""http://developers.myzeo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.myzeo.com/</a><p>So we took the open approach and can't wait to see what cool (and strange!) things people use the platform for.

If anyone wants early access to the API sign up and let us know you want early access when you do.  We have a forthcoming grant program as well - we will be giving out a bunch of free product to whomever suggests the coolest uses - email me ben@myzeo.com for more info.",1284480673

""But this pipe dream is being crushed quickly. The carriers, after giving up ground initially, are fighting back. They are using Androidâs openness against the company.""<p>The point is: if Google hadn't done that, the carriers may very well not have supported it. Let's remember that although now we consider Android a strong contender, at the time Android was neither that strong, nor the only contender. I'd be ready to bet that other carriers supported Android as much to hurt Apple as because they knew they could control it.<p>Personally I'd go as far as to say that Google developed Android the way they did fully aware that this could happen: the bottom line is that Google doesn't make money from Android, and as nobody holds the market in the palm of their hand Google is happy... even though it may mean basically subsidising other companies fight against Apple (at the time).",1284480642

People here (generally) don't eat at chains.  I don't know where you were when you tried them, but if it's the outer richmond then you aren't likely finding good mexican.  The mission is (oddly enough) packed full of very yummy taquerias.  It's where the latino population lives and all.<p>Cost of living.  It depends on what you want I guess.  I had a place in the inner richmond that was $1675 for a 700ish sq foot place.  It was perfect for a single guy.  It was cramped for me, my girlfriend, and 3 cats.  It was in a great location too.  Now I pay $2200 to live in a huge loft in SoMA with a parking spot in the garage.  Love the location.  Check craigslist to see how housing prices are in the city (and surrounding area actually).<p>Coming from DC, food is the thing that I notice as being more expensive.  Not necessarily at safeway...it's about the same, but restaurants are more expensive.  Lunch out for me in the DC burbs was $6.50 or so (Potbelly, Baja Fresh, etc.).  Here it's $10, but there aren't any chains around.  Similar pricing happens for dinner.  In DC (again at chains in the burbs mostly) I'd spend around $20 a meal.  Here the average is probably $30.  Not huge, but noticeable.<p>On the plus side, my gas and electric bill is super cheap.  We pay $35-$45 a month for electricity and gas.  Part of that is having huge west facing windows so we don't ever have to turn on the heat even in the winter.  The other part is obviously not having A/C.  My condo in virginia averages $161 a month for the year...I save a ton on electricity/gas here.<p>Cable cost the same.  Renter's insurance is about the same.

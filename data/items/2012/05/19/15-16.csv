3996214,comment,3996085,3996140,1,0,geogra4,,,"> Why Tech?<p>I guess I've always enjoyed being around technology. I've been using computers as long as I've been around. As a kid in the mid 90s my brother and I used to install Debian on old powerpcs we had lying around the house for fun. I've built PCs from components for myself. I run Linux on the desktop. In college I took some tech courses (CS 101, Intro to Databases) and I always did enjoy automating repetitive tasks via scripting.<p>>What do you really want to do in your life?<p>I want to have a nice life with my fiancee, I guess. I like understanding things. I enjoy knowing something at the level that I can explain it very well as opposed to knowledge of something just at the level where I can use it.<p>At some level I do like creating things too, but I seem to have a very high inertia a lot of the time. I just end up thinking of ideas as opposed to implementing them. I love working with computers because software can things so easily when you just provide the idea.<p>>What things to you find yourself doing when no one's paying you?<p>I daydream. I listen to music. I think of new things to cook. I ride my bike around town. Maybe I'll complete some intro challenges on a site like codecademy for fun. I'll read HN, Slashdot. I've always been intrigued by the future of technological progress. I'm excited by google's self-driving cars.",1337443040

3996204,comment,3995374,3995374,10,0,steve8918,,,"About 9 months ago I went through the exact same thing.  I was experiencing the inability to learn new things, the inability to remember very basic words (so I would stall in the middle of a conversation, trying to remember the word), and sometimes I was confused over things that were extremely basic, like which toothbrush was mine.  It was extremely debilitating, and being a programmer it affected my performance drastically.  I couldn't fix bugs quickly, and when given new tasks, it would take me much much longer to actually understand WTF I was supposed to do.  I then started getting a tremendous headache that felt like a vise grip on the back of my neck, and at that point, I couldn't even remember what I had done earlier that day.  Trying to learn new things was almost impossible, it was like my brain was unable to function at all.<p>After a couple of months of this, I finally went to the doctor, and immediately got an MRI for possible brain tumor.  Thankfully it turned out negative, and that's when I did some self-diagnosis and thought I must be sleep-deprived.  I was getting about 4-6 hrs sleep every night for years, so I immediately started getting into bed at 10pm and would lay there until I eventually fell asleep.<p>Within a week, my headache disappeared and I felt much better.  The funny thing is that since then, I can't stay away past 10:30pm, regardless of how long I sleep.  By 9:30pm I'm exhausted, and after staying up past midnight for years/decades, a few months after sleeping at 10:30pm, I have almost no capacity to stay up late anymore.<p>I still think I have other sleep problems like obstructive sleep apnea, because I still don't get good quality sleep, so I'm scheduled for a sleep clinic in the next few weeks.  I went to a seminar hosted by Kaiser on this, and the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea were so exactly the same as what I was experiencing that I almost burst into tears because I realized I wasn't crazy, and it felt like there was finally some hope.<p>In summary: get your sleep, it is precious!",1337442626

This is a conception that some popular science writing installs in many people and that could easily be cured by tracking the long history of many things we consider simple, in which at least tens of people contributed ideas that made the final invention tick. The article sums it up very well:<p><i>First of all, Id contend that nearly every invention in the engineering or sciences is an improvement on what has come before  such as Teslas improvements to alternating current.

Worse is better won a long back. Fighting that has proven to be futile.<p>No, it hasn't. Pragmatism won over theoretical grounds. And there are very many pragmatic reasons to prefer PHP for certain projects. No one is arguing against that.<p>But, with legacy and a changing market, some of those pragmatic choices come back to bite you.<p>There are many ways to combat this. One can evolve the language, for example. This has worked better for some languages (Javascript comes to mind) that share some of design flaws in PHP, than it has for PHP itself.<p>What I am arguing about, is that, we as an industry, as a community, as a profession, we shouldn't be aiming for a future where PHP is still dominant, any more than we should be aiming for a future where horses are our dominant means of transportation.<p>Now, maybe we can shoehorn modern features into PHP. It has been tried with PHP4 and PHP5.<p>But for what reason? There isn't any decent implementation of PHP (performance and stability wise). Other syntaxes aren't that hard to get accustomed to. The algorithmic complexity of core operations has changed between versions. It's not like there is any important code written in PHP, that must survive some transition, like there is with C.<p>Is it just to keep those on board, with no academic training, who only know PHP? If they were capable of learning PHP by themselves, would other languages really be that hard for them to use (or abuse)?",1337442584

Sure, it uses blunt language, but is the writer related to Edison distantly or his childhood hero or something?<p>Reading the article, I would bet the comic under the second paragraph of ""Tesla Wasnt The First Person To Discover X-Rays"" was what started the article.  The comic is out-and-out false.<p>As to being a comic so why should he care.  I would point the the Daily Show and The Colbert Report.  Both are listed as comedies, but a lot of people report what they say as fact.  The Oatmeal got a lot of play for the Game of Thrones comic so people use it as a source also.<p>To give a bit of political example.  If I were to ask for a description of President Ford one of the first words to come to mind during the 70's would have been ""clumsy"" or ""physically inept"".  This is the result of comedy sketches on SNL and not reality.  Reality is he slipped on camera.

Suppose I'm starting a company, and I'm starting it solo. I've been using PHP successfully for many years, and I know it and the environment (Apache, etc.) <i>really</i> well. I know what libraries are good, what libraries are not good, I have a framework that I like, and that I know how to set up to my liking. By the way, I'm really excited about this company.<p>Now, PHP is pretty awful as a <i>programming language</i>. I really don't like it. But the reality is, <i>I</i> am going be <i>dramatically more efficient</i> with it. If I were to use Rails, it would take me at the very least a week or two to really be able to use it without checking documentation constantly, and it would probably take me months to be at a proficiency where I was totally comfortable with it, and the environment it lives in, and figured out which libraries to use with it and so on.<p>During those months, when I should be focussing on building my business, talking to customers, getting feedback, learning more about marketing, I am instead dealing with the friction of learning a new programming environment. If I had stuck with PHP, all I have to do is sit at a terminal and let the code flow out of my fingertips. All of my actual thinking could go into the important stuff.<p>I don't deny that PHP is pretty terrible as a programing language.

Arrays are objects, yes, but objects are not arrays.<p>So, unless you are extending the build-in array type, objects do not behave as arrays. They are not recognized as arrays, and more importantly, no modern javascript engine actually implements arrays as hashes.<p>For example {}.length has no value. It does not have a length of zero, it does not have a length at all. Visa versa, when looking at an object-map as a 'map', you'll get the array entries, as well as the length property, and the push and pop methods.<p>It's orthogonal. Imagine a javascript engine having no special implementation for an Array. We could implement it on top of the object-map. So, an array does not behave as a map, its implemented in a map. There's a clear distinction.<p>But the parallels with PHP are interesting. Both languages were not designed with the intent of large applications, but with the intent of adding a small piece of isolated logic to what is mostly a template. Both languages have had a lot of flack for their early design choices as well. People are still upset how Javascript handles casting (which is similar to how PHP handles it), and they are still upset how Javascript handles scoping (which is again similar to how PHP handles it).<p>Where the languages start differing, is that Javascript is much more reflective, which allows one to fix many language flaws in library or framework code, to suit different use-cases like the development of large scale projects. (just consider the hundreds of class-based systems implemented in Javascript)<p>But even for Javascript, the same logic applies. Considering the role and purpose it has now, the language design would have been different, if it was not for backwards compatibility.<p>And there as well, people are trying to figure out ways to make it radically better. Dart comes to mind. Compiling other languages into javascript. (coffeescript, gwt, etc.)<p>And even arguments in favor of Node.js are all based on the assumption that we are stuck with Javascript in the browser.<p>And just as with PHP, the original authors themselves, make no secret that their language design wasn't optimized or optimal for how we are using it now.",1337441297

It can mean: reducing the complexity of interface, reducing the complexity of operations, reducing the understanding required for use, reducing work to do the unanticipated, keeping common metaphors (as opposed to introducing new ones), and on and on. Ugh.<p>For example, I deal with a lot of network code. I regularly have to make various softwares work with different protocols, sometimes in async systems, sometime in threaded systems, sometimes in simple blocking systems. Further, networking is an inherently layered space - (eg. the JSON app specific protocol sits on http sits on tcp, which sits on ip, which sits on ethernet, id like to bea able to say is encapsulated in rather than sits on, but that breaks at various layers :/). So anyway I get the order to implement support for FooProto in a few systems. Great, I've heard about FooProto and wanted to play a bit.<p>A bit of research turns up that there are a few major and complete implementations. One is the reference implementation and it is of course big, bloated and slow. It does everything but there is no cohesion to the API or whatever. That one is probably out.<p>So the others have mixed reviews but a few are very popular and ""simple"".<p>Option 1: exposes 4 methods, provides my code with a well designed data structure, and looks fantastic. Problem is, it does blocking I/O and isn't thread-safe. It will work for some situations, but not all the ones I have. Worse, the transport is pretty heavily tied to the socket code and various system calls. But it is very simple.<p>Option 2: optimized for non-blocking. Has lots of callback hooks. Still tied in with the socket/syscall layers, but not in a way that makes extraction impossible. But it would take a few hundred lines of wrapper to make it look synchronous. And forget thread safety.<p>Option 3: Really thread safe, decent api, layers split out, but in a weird metaphor that requires some odd wrapper code would really require some rework to translate, or would require reworking of the hosting code to deal with the metaphor.<p>So which of these is simpler? Arguably each of them. One solution of course would be to use each as needed. Then of course I have to track multiple APIs, there are integration and bug compatability concerns. Not really simple.<p>Odds are I'll end up choosing the reference implementation or make my own, just because in the small it is more complex, but in the large, it makes my life simpler - one code base to handle multiple situations.  Also a simpler choice, albeit on a different access.<p>So my point is, simplicity is not just hard, but sometime incompatible with itself. Simple on one axis may complicate things on another, and in irreconcilable ways.<p><i>Aside: To anyone implementing protocols -- _Please_ keep your parsers, state machines and transports as loosely coupled as possible. I, and many people I know, will love you for it. Transports change, encapsulation is common, and networks seem to be mostly edge-case. Feel free to add a layer tying them all together in a nice common-use api, this is a good thing too, but keep in mind there are always other use cases. Keep in mind that you are always just feeding your parser a stream of bytes, and feeding your state machine a series of tokens. Some protocols have a few layers of this built in. Due to the nature of the beast tho, it always can be modeled that way.</i>",1337441166

I've created a general-purpose PHP daemon library (<a href=""http://shaneharter.github.com/PHP-Daemon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shaneharter.github.com/PHP-Daemon/</a>).<p>There is no question that the PHP implementation of these APIs (think: Socket, SystemV, POSIX, etc) is very underwhelming compared to something you'd get in Python, Java, or nearly any language. And it's partly because of that that I felt it would be irresponsible for me not to include a disclaimer at the top of my github readme:<p><i>For many reasons PHP is not an optimal language choice for creating servers or daemons. I created this library so if you must use PHP for these things, you can do it with ease and produce great results. But if you have the choice, Java, Python, Ruby, etc, are all better suited for this.</i><p>So that being said:<p>With a general-purpose daemon library, there's a 3rd use-case to what you described: People who need to create daemons/servers/etc that use a large existing codebase: maybe it needs to share the 80 models that run your primary website. Maybe you've written a large domain-specific library. That sort of thing.<p>While it's a little more difficult for me to apply those reasons to a Tornado port, I'd like to hear from the developers first before I dismissed their work.",1337440681

Mongo is for me not a database. And I worked like you 15 years with RDBMS and a year with mongo. Mongo has no security. Especially the Mongo Cluster Solution makes it so easy to steal and manipulate datas without notice.
Everyone who has access to the server can enter the database. Implemented ""security"" could be turned off with a restart.<p>And nowadays it is so easy in a datamodel in a RDBMS to make changes. It is high flexible too.<p>But another worst thing in Mongo is the performance at complex queries.

The man at the front on the left has a very bright left side of his face, and a very dark right side (also notice the shadow and light around his ear). Everything else in this photo seems consistent with this.<p>The reason for there appearing to be more dirt on the child's face is simply because it's a higher contrast image.<p>Maybe it has been manipulated more than is allowed, but I'm not seeing it.<p>EDIT: I'm not sure that there's only one artificial light source  notice how the front left man's visible ear is red? That's because it's being brightly illuminated from behind. Also notice that the top of his back (his left  photo right  shoulder) is illuminated, and that would be in shadow if the photo was only being lit by the flash that is lighting the left (his right) side of his face.

The front of the glasses is bulky and presses down hard on the bridge of your nose. The sides don't open fully, so they're squeezing your head like a vise. Since I also wear normal glasses, I have to layer them under these captioning glasses. Friends and I joke about me being six-eyed.<p>As for watching through these glasses, they use a holographic display for the captions. Since they are projected directly onto the glasses, I learned very quickly to keep my head absolutely still so I could read the capions without getting motion sickness. The brightness and size are adjustable, which means you can choose from a bright green text and background or fainter levels of green. I'm not quite sure how the glasses receive the captions to be displayed, but it's via some sort of wireless technology. In the three theatres I've watched movies at with these glasses, they drop lines frequently, which is an exercise in frustration. I assume those two things are related. These glasses are hard to distribute -- each costs about $1,000, or so I hear. Not good if you run out and a deaf person needs to watch a movie, which has happened before.<p>Rear-view windows have similar problems, replacing wearing something uncomfortable on your face with wrestling against an adjustable mirror on a stalk. All in all, I'd say I enjoy open captioned movies in theatres the most -- where they display the captions directly in the movie.",1368441212

I don't have lots of experience with them, but from what I've seen they're an amazing example of the term ""network effect"".<p>They're basically leased windows computers with a dedicated application that displays realtime market data. They run about $20k/yr. They come with a funky keyboard, and the app has all sorts of messaging and searching functions into a wide variety of markets. Typically, the average user uses only a tiny fraction of the capability they have via these terminals (the pork belly futures trader doesn't ever bother with high tech semiconductor trades). Because everybody is on a Bloomberg terminal, and it has a dedicated messaging system, you need a Bloomberg terminal to chat with other traders to make deals - hence the network effect. It also marks you as a ""serious"" player, even small offices with a couple guys will have these terminals.<p>Since Bloomberg has total vertical integration, from data source to keyboard, it means they collect, or have the potential to collection incredible amounts of information about their user community. Every chat, every query, every trade, every login, logoff, every keypress.<p>So the unsurprising question is, why wouldn't other parts of Bloomberg have access to some/all of this data? And even if everybody was terribly offended by that, what are they going to do?

1. Vast majority are from really rich families. Like million dollars in family assets. The education is either very expensive or they were top students in their schools, which usually happens because they went to private schools.
2. People working in India never take low pay after 2 years of experience. It's only during the first few years that we trade an opportunity to gain experience with low wages. Theres a very high attrition rate in all it companies in India and salaries are ever increasing.
3. Young Indians have the opposite problem of being hard working. Most spend extended hours in office to socialize than to actually get stuff done. 
4. The part about growing smugness is true. Indians traditionally seldom call ourselves ""experts"" in any thing even if we know stuff. 
5. Losing h1b is big deal. You are given notice to leave country with your family in no time. Technically u need to leave the country within a month if you don't want to be barred from reentry. So in that one month, you have to try and sell all your stuff, cars, house, furniture, discontinue schooling for your kids and collect transcripts, medical records,file taxes,payoff debt.

Trade enables specialisation and cooperation on a massive scale. If the scope and benefit of global trade doesn't ""transcend the individual"", I struggle to think of anything that does.<p>The classic ""I, Pencil"" essay[1], while written even polemically in support of capitalism, also serves as a great example of the scale of human cooperation enabled by currency.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html</a>",1368440435

Every sensor in the iPhone today (eg. magnetometer) has a real purpose for improving user experience (directional geolocation), but the implementation (apps) can be somewhat gimmicky (compass app).

In my not-so-democratic home country, in many businesses the norm of doing business is not strictly by the law and the government turns blind eye on this as long as you play the ball. Whenever somebody upsets somebody in power, the might of the legal system crushes them without touching their cooperating competitors. It is completely legal way to silence anybody who you don't like that much. The non-profits are even more exposed.<p>We even have a mayor who tried to demolish the campus of a prestigious university that issued reports about contamination in the drinking water, putting political pressure on the mayor. After some media circus(the mayor sent bogus samples to be analyzed but when university took the samples by itself, the results were much different), somehow he found an irregularity in the papers of the buildings and issued an order to for demolishing the 60 years old, architecture awards winning campus. Thankfully the court decided that destroying the university was not in benefit of the society and blocked the order.<p>I have to note that this happened in the capital of the country, the irregularity was that the drawings were not in the exact same scale that the town required and somehow the legal system proceeded so quickly when lagging for years to prosecute many scandalous building projects of some friendly businessmen.",1368440110

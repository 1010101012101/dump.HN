4856506,comment,4855892,4856017,1,0,DigitalSea,,,"When developing a HTML email it's best to have style tags at the top and not link to them using <link rel> because the way HTML email works and various clients, you have to bring the CSS inline for it to work properly across different email clients anyway.<p>It's a trial and error process. Build HTML emails using tables for as much as possible, you can't use background images just background colours, don't rely on floats or other common CSS properties (even using height or width in your CSS isn't as supported as well as you'd think) and the number one thing to remember is: the day a client complains it doesn't look good in Lotus Notes, you will want to throw your computer out the window and become a farmer because it's never going to work in Lotus Notes.<p>Always make sure your images are set to display block to fix issues with various email services like Windows Mail and Yahoo! Mail. If you need to set them side-by-side, add in another td inside of your table row.<p>Always make sure you write alternative text for images. Most email clients are set to not to display images in emails unless told otherwise. Another convenient feature not many know about is that you can style the alt text that shows. <img src=""ourlogo.png"" alt=""Acme Company"" style=""color:#000;font-size:20px;"" /> — doing this ensures even if someone without images still sees something that doesn't look like hideous empty squares.<p>With later versions of Outlook, Microsoft also stripped back support for various CSS attributes and HTML tags compared to previous version so you'll find you will encounter a lot of frustration with that as well.",1354326594

4856501,comment,4855043,4855590,7,0,freakboy3742,,,"I'm the author of the feature, so I figured I should give some explanation.<p>REQUIRED_FIELDS is used internally in one place -- in the createsuperuser management command. When you run that command, you are prompted for the minimal set of fields to create a user object. REQUIRED_FIELDS is that list of fields.<p>Could this be used elsewhere? Sure. A model form, for example, could use this list as the minimal data to create a user object.<p>Could this be replaced with some model introspection? Possibly. On my first pass through, this is exactly what I tried to do. And the code got messy really quickly.<p>At a first approximation, any field with blank=False and no default is essentially ""required"". However, what about BooleanFields? BooleanFields have an automatically default to False, but that doesn't necessarily mean that False is an appropriate value. And what about custom fields that use the same ""built-in default"" pattern?<p>There's also a possible edge case where a field strictly isn't required (e.g., it's blankable) but from a business logic perspective, you always want to have a value.<p>Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that the mess was worth it. That said, I'm not 100% opposed to cleaning it up. Essentially, if someone can make createsuperuser work without the need for REQUIRED_FIELDS, and the code is robust and isn't a mess, I'm willing to look at the patch before 1.5 final. However, I'm not planning on looking at this problem myself.",1354326466

Most places listed on AirBNB are occupied by owners putting their place up when they leave town. A few maybe not, but even in that case, why favor long-term renters over short-term renters?<p>#4 is a great point, but insurmountably restrictive laws make things worse by not allowing people to come to negotiated agreements with their landlords on using AirBNB.

4856392,comment,4853509,4853509,2,0,frankus,,,"I've been thinking a lot lately about what sorts of systems ""the rest of us"" (where by ""us"" I mean ""them"") are able to program effectively.<p>One thing I've noticed is that people that don't really know programming in a hacker sense seem to have no problem creating a spreadsheet that calculates even fairly complex things (not that FizzBuzz is complicated, but see here: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnUa0E6R--UedGdiaFF3NV90MEs0cE4xVm5ZaC1ZUXc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnUa0E6R--UedGd...</a>).<p>I think one of the biggest factors is that users don't have to keep track of the order of operations. If you change the value in cell A1, and cell B6 depends on it, and D5 depends on it, and so on until you get to Z22, there's no step-by-step thinking about what order the calculations will be done in. Basically a change in the input is instantaneously (and automatically, transparently) reflected in the output.<p>Another big factor is that all state is made explicit by default.<p>In some ways it seems similar to functional reactive programming. The code for e.g. FizzBuzz looks crazy complicated (<a href=""http://www.lejordet.com/2012/01/fizzbuzz-with-reactive-extensions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lejordet.com/2012/01/fizzbuzz-with-reactive-exten...</a>), but if you hooked it together in a GUI (sort of how Quartz Composer works on the Mac) it would probably be pretty easy to wrap your head around, and probably possible for someone with no formal programming knowledge to figure out, if not recreate.",1354324143

You should not have as much CSS as you're describing in your emails to begin with. The more CSS the more chances there are for it to break. Images and tables are the way to go and you'd be surprised at how creative you can get under those constraints and how beautiful the result can be.<p>Most web based email clients will rip out your <head> so link tags aren't a good idea. You'll need to inline 90%+ of your CSS. I usually create the table layout then add the inline style later. You can use the Mailchimp CSS inliner tool for quicker results.<p>I usually inline it all and leave some bits in a style tag. That's really the best you can do because of the crazy inconsistencies between email clients. Email clients render HTML and CSS like it's the 90's. Check out Campaign Monitor's blog. They have a big chart that shows you what HTML/CSS is compatible in each client. It's a life saver. I have it posted in my cube and I use it every day.",1354323618

Germany has the brilliant dual education system where apprenticeships have never ceased to exist and It's the true driver behind Germany's incredible performance recently. After 10th grade I left high shool and joined a company ( Siemens ) ""full time"" as a trainee. This means that 4 days of the week you work and 1 day you go to vocational school where you learn about CS fundamentals like compilers and algorithms. The program takes 3 years ( just like the rest of high school ).<p>It's true, you make almost no money, the work is hard, and you are at the bottom of the food chain but if you get a good placement you will never learn faster in your live. Trying to finish programming projects while also keeping everyone coordinated and cleaning the kitchens also does a great job of stuffing out the entitlement that so many people join the workforce with.<p>If you have any doubt about the merit of this style of education simply look at Germany. It's vastly superior and I'm raking my brain on how to reproduce this system in North America successfully.",1354323606

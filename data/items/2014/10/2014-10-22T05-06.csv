8491585,comment,8489156,8489156,0,0,fsloth,,,"Thank you for referencing this outstanding historical presentation. Perhaps one day we shall get out of this strange amnesia software engineering seems to have as a field (or pop culture as Alan Kay poignantly put it). I find it odd I discover the good stuff only when I have practiced programming over ten years while I consider myself a fairly voracious autodidact.<p>Why is it that we are offered snake oil like UML, RUP, GoF patterns and other cargo cult or just otherwise trite nonsense when these basic ingredients of proper programming - simplicity, understandability, minimization of labour, difficulty of reusability - seem to come as great surprise and revelation only after working quite some time.<p>I find the reusability fallacy particularly offensive as a trumpeted design paradigm since it&#x27;s so hard to get it right, especially since it is often sold as a project feature based on the hypothesis of cost savings. If one achieves practical reusability in ones components, that is a thing to be celebrated, truly. But you cannot say, we shall write this generic domain specific widget _ and make it reusable _ without the understading that this will probably need a lot more design and research than just implementing the domain widget as a stand alone module.",1413957476

Lyme has a habit of converting anybody affected by it into an activist, which probably stems from the controversy over diagnosis and treatment of things like chronic Lyme.<p>Earlier this year I founded TickChek.com, a startup that offers PCR-based laboratory tick testing that can determine whether or not a tick that bit you carries Borrelia (the Lyme disease bacteria) or other tick borne disease vectors with 99.99% accuracy. We&#x27;ve tested hundreds of ticks so far, and most of our customers use our lab results to help decide whether antibiotics or full blood testing is necessary.<p>Most people aren&#x27;t aware of tick testing as an option for determining their risk of contracting Lyme, and we&#x27;re going to be working hard to spread awareness before next year&#x27; tick season.",1413957475

I was never a firm believer nor a firm disbeliever. Advances in modern science such as this article only brings new light to how I think about this.<p>Whilst it may seem to be a form of discrimination to judge a person by their appearance just like racism or sexism, maybe there is certain evolutionary notion behind this. Maybe we as human have evolved certain abilities to recognize a person&#x27;s inner traits/personality based on their look. I certainly do not believe that beauty or handsomeness maybe a fact in determining the personality of a person. But through observation a person&#x27;s confidence or innocence can be somewhat picked out by how they appear. Which I do not believe is correlated with how they portray themselves in terms of exterior such as haircuts or the amount of make up they put on.

Based on that, it looks like the NTM is learning <i>a lot</i> faster than the LSTM. As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s getting near 0 loss about 20,000 examples in? It depends on the domain for whether learning w/ 20k examples is impressive or not, personally I think it&#x27;s comparatively impressive.<p>Re: cherry picking of tasks to highlight perceived strengths of NTM, fair enough.

There will always be something to do every single night (to your detriment if you&#x27;re not responsible). You have access to tons of events with good looking sorority members every week which increases the likelihood that you&#x27;ll get somewhere with someone. You meet so many different women your head spins, the odds are just in your favor.<p>Those are basically the main benefits. Greek culture actually varies quite a bit from campus to campus.

Think of a calculator that has the Pi&#x27;s SD slot, HDMI, USB, GPIO, etc ports.<p>When used in class or on tests, it can run a built-in program from its ROM.  For use in full computer mode, you boot it off an SD card.  Anti-cheating can be done via DRM features that are already available on the chip (although open-source purists wouldn&#x27;t like this part, but it shouldn&#x27;t get in the way in &quot;full computer&quot; mode).<p>The way the anti-cheat code could work is simply a calculator function which gives a digital signature hash based on user input.  Student enters a serial number from the test, and writes down the function&#x27;s output (which is derived using a private key burned into the chip, and only accessible by the built-in calculator-mode code).<p>The reason I think a calculator form factor would work better for the education market, is that every high school already requires a $100 graphing calculator, so might as well make it the calculator be of more use.",1413955635

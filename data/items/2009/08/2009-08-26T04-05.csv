Most people are more concerned with what they can make with what they have.<p>Therefore, eliminate the need to pick a dish.  Allow your user to select an ingredient, then narrow the list of options for further selections to only those ingredients that are common to dishes containing the selected ingredient.<p>For example, if you pick tomatoes, then parmesan, you can probably eliminate pickles from the list.

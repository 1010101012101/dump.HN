969901,comment,967773,969641,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Well, this <i>one specific instance</i> is the subject of our conversation and what some folks are calling the ""smoking gun"" of a conspiracy. So naturally I thought that's what they're talking about.<p>I am not so concerned with addressing how to recover the lost data, all I was concerned with addressing was that this statistical ""trick"" was nothing of consequence and not irreversible. People here (including you) have made much ado about changing the data, and I wanted to address that the ""changed data"" is not so changed at all. You can see what they're doing and the emails explain why.<p>Finally, you asked why I believe that climate science deserves lower levels of care and transparency? I assume fom here on out we're not talking about the lost raw data (which was, from all claims, an accidental oversight) and instead focus on the withheld line of evidence.<p>I didn't say that. For one, it certainly requires more care because–unlike econometrics–<i>Climate Science is actual science</i>. And I don't think care hasn't been exercised here. I think what you want is transparency on a level above and beyond what science normally requires. While ditching the raw data is regrettable and a mistake (probably on the order of NASA losing the original moon landing data), it shouldn't really change anything.<p>Now, if the CRU was the lone voice trying ardently to make a case that AGW was happening and they lost the raw data to the sole line of evidence, that'd be problematic for the case of AGW. But CRU and other institutions have multiple lines of data that have been clearly published and explained that are in accord with the lost batch of raw data. So my opinion, which I try to base off the majority view of science, is unswayed.<p>If the CRU folks had ""hidden the decline"" from public discourse and corrected for it in their data, that'd also be an ethics problem. But they didn't hide the existence of the observed temp decline, it's mentioned in published papers (as has been mentioned in the hn commentary to this story).<p>P.S. I don't think the CRU folks have been particularly careless or particularly opaque compared to, say, physicists or astronomers or biologists.  And I am not convinced that econometrics is a science. I think it's a blanket term for mathematical modeling, which is part of science. Perhaps there are charlatans confusing the issue, but I've seen some pretty absurd things written under the name of econometrics.",1259682330

969878,comment,969647,969647,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"This just touched a big nerve with me, so be prepared for a rant.<p>I've been an ER/Critical Care nurse for 15 years.  I've worked/contracted at over 30 hospital, and I've worked in a number of different specialties.  I recently went back to school for a CS degree, and I'm working 3 days a week as an ER nurse, and I code the other 3 nights a week on my social news site for economic and financial news, <a href=""http://Newsley.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Newsley.com</a>.<p>I get asked all the time by people at Hackers and Founders meetups as to why I'm not going in to Health Care IT.  
And, the short answer, is that the computerization of healthcare is wrong.  I currently work at a hospital that's consistently named one of the nation's ""Most Wired"", and the more I work at a ""Wired"" hospital, the more of a luddite I become.  As much as I love computers, I think that their role in Health Care should be limited to a very few places.<p>Why?  Here's the long answer:<p>- Culture.  When a physician graduates from med school, they take a vow to ""First, do no harm.""  The culture of safety, is everywhere.  Physicians change their practice slowly based on research that often takes years to vet.  Medications take years to pass FDA approval.  This is all because of the very strong culture of safety in hospitals.  Now, try and meld that with an IT culture where a generation in technology is 18 months, and user's heads explode.  I've seen CardioThoracic surgeons who makes $750 thousand a year cutting into beating hearts struggle for an hour trying to put orders into a new computer system .  A lot of physicians trained in the last 40 years never learned to type, and really don't use computers much.  It's simply not cost effective to force physicians to make the huge adjustments in their practice to fit the needs of the IT department.<p>-Disasters.  If any organization has to run in a disaster, it has to be a hospital.  There aren't many disasters that can prevent me from writing a note on a paper chart in a disaster.  But, every computer system that I've worked on in hospitals crashes.  When that happens the whole hospital is crippled.  Fault tolerant, reliable systems are essential for hospitals, and frankly, they just don't have the money to spend to build them or buy them.  Paper is much more forgiving in a disaster  than a huge distributed computer applcation running on 1000 Windows PC's with a datacenter back in New Jersey.<p>-Time.  More often than not, I've seen software systems slow patient care down by a factor of 1-4x.  We have to spend a lot more time looking at the computer rather than looking at my patient.<p>-Money.  I've alluded to it above.  But, when hospitals actually are running in the black financially, they tend to run a 1-2% profit margin.  Software systems to run hospitals usually tend to cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, and a large support team to manage them.  Hospitals generally don't have the money to pay top notch talent to maintain a really complex IT system.<p>-Bugs.  Bugs are a fact of life for programmers.  Bugs happen all the time.  But, when a bug happens in a healthcare setting, people die.  I've seen in happen, and it sickens me.<p>-Proprietary data formats.  Every application that I've ever worked with in a hospital has been proprietary.  That means proprietary data formats.  A typical hospital will use dozens of different systems that all have their own proprietary data formats from automated lab systems, EKG machines, vital sign monitors, billing systems, inventory tracking systems, etc...  All those systems have to be integrated, and for that data to be available across systems is really hard. (see Bugs and Money above).<p>After years of thinking about this, and working in this environment,  I've come to the conclusion that paper is simply a much better technology for the industry.  Really.  Paper is cheap,  portable, fault tolerant and easy to change.  I don't have to wait for months for a work order to go through IT to change a database schema when I want to adjust the data that I'm gathering at Triage for instance.  I can just have someone print up a copy of the new form.  
I'll stop now, but if you want to hear more of this rant, feel free to stop by our next meetup and buy me a beer.   By the time we're done we'll both need it.  As you can see, it's a hot button issue for me. :)",1259681812

It is a nice feature to have the pages display the pop-ups that darken the remainder of the page for features where you do not feel like you should leave the page, but honestly, I would prefer some of the other pages to load.  I am not sure if you know what I mean from my description so I will try saying it again.  When browsing web sites, sometimes content is dynamic and it does not need to load the entire page.  However, to have a pop-up div for what seemed like everything I clicked is a bit of a bother.  It does not seem to flow as well I would have liked in that regard.<p>Also, I had no idea what the site was about at first.  I had to actually search the site a bit to even figure out what was happening.<p>In regards to the idea, I think it is a decent idea, but this seems like a feature that may be best featured within another web application.  After this is perfected, I can see the potential for a company purchasing it if only for integration within their own products; however, it does not seem like it has much potential value until you add a bit more to it.  It needs to be tweaked slightly.  I would continue focusing on the core concept just a tad longer before moving on to additional features.",1259681667

The ES committee is watching and learning from what is going on in the wild, and there is some overlapping consensus now on how JS can improve with regards to programming-in-the-large.

They devolve in flamefests because people think that their particular company is being wronged, regardless of their original stance on patents etc. before such news involving their companies came out.<p>Asymco's analysis always seems to make errors that favor Apple, like leaving out HTC from stats on how profitable Android OEMs are. Or something like this <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2887430"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2887430</a><p>Same with Gruber with his extreme pro-Apple spin on everything.

No wonder the discussion runs into a flamefest with very harsh moderation.<p>Not singling out Apple here, there are examples where criticizing Google will get you automatically downvoted here on HN.<p>Some part of the moderation seems to be on 'party lines'. Criticize Apple or Google, or support MS and face downvotes or no votes. Criticize MS, get a boatload of karma. All this regardless of the actual facts on hand.<p>As you say, all this may be good for companies, especially ones that carefully cultivate their brand image to use such effects positively, but this is not really beneficial to honest discussion, information or analysis. It turns the conversation into Fox News vs. MSNBC. with people unable to admit their favorite company can do something wrong once in a while, resulting in people mudslinging the competition instead.<p>Also, see Roughly Drafted and Boycott Novell(now techrights.org).",1313603714

2896206,comment,2895569,2895569,2,0,SwellJoe,,,"I played with a Nook Color at B&N a couple of days ago. If I were to buy a tablet, that's the one I'd buy. It's dirt cheap ($249), seems reasonably fast, and can be hacked into a real Android tablet (not a reasonable thing for a normal consumer to do, but it wouldn't be a problem for me). But, the things I could think of to use it for, I already have a Kindle and a Nexus One and a netbook for...so, I opted not to add more electronics crap to my very small house. Maybe the next generation Nook Color will convince me that a tablet is something I need/want.<p>My point is that the price of the HP was <i>obviously</i> wrong. It's not an Apple product...people don't expect to pay Apple prices. There's an assumption (right or wrong) that Apple imposes a stiff Apple tax on every product they sell, so I expect any non-Apple product to be much cheaper and have better specs. When that expectation is not met, I feel like the non-Apple product is over-priced. Apparently the TouchPad also sucks, while the iPad is apparently awesome, which makes the TouchPad an even harder sell.",1313603589

When something that is not actually HTML can be interpreted in a browser as HTML, there is a big potential security hole.<p>For example: At one point, I sanitized incoming user content by parsing it as HTML and nuking almost all markup  (I allowed links and italics to pass through). THEN I realized this wasn't good enough, because Firefox was parsing unclosed image tags as though they were closed. The (strict) parser I was using would pass through a user's unclosed image tag as plain text, but Firefox would load it as an image. An attacker could have used that to not only collect visitor IPs (by loading an image on his server) but also to do various things with Javascript -- an image tag can include an onload attribute. (I have no idea if Firefox still works this way, it was about five years ago.)",1313603375

This seems perfectly reasonable to me, and it holds pretty closely to the original idea of patents: A specialized device that performs an action is an invention, but the act being performed is not an invention. I also don't think that software that emulates the hardware is not in violation of the hardware patent.<p>I think B is a much bigger problem. Any computer program could be performed with pencil and paper, by getting a big file folder to simulate RAM, indexing it by numbers, and performing assembly instructions by hand with post-it notes as registers.

2896176,comment,2891654,2892392,2,0,ircmaxell,,,"Thank you for the comments!  My point wasn't to show how wasteful or bad rainbow tables are.  My point was that brute forcing is actually significantly easier than people realize (to the point of being almost as efficient as rainbow tables depending on the circumstances).  And since any standard measure that prevents brute forcing will also help prevent rainbow tables, the point that I was trying to convey is that you should not try to protect against rainbow tables exclusively, but you should try to protect against brute forcing and get the rainbow table protection that comes naturally from that step...<p>With respect to the 4 character password limitation, that was mainly to show how powerful brute forcing can be, not how bad rainbow tables are.<p>Sure, you can make a dictionary rainbow table based off a normal english dictionary with perturbations (caps/symbol replacements) and have it be more efficient than a brute force for any size.  But I was looking at it form a guaranteed match aspect, not a ""probable match"".  So for a guaranteed match against an 8 character password, the rainbow table would have to be gigantic, but brute forcing would likely not take as much time.<p>Perhaps I should have presented it a bit differently.  But I purposely wanted to take the worst case approach to demonstrate just how efficient brute forcing can be.  If that painted a slightly tainted picture, then fine.

As the OP correctly notes, this business model does not generate positive network effects for subscribers and, in my opinion, for merchants either (i.e. the larger the list of subscribers the smaller percentage of high quality sales leads generated).  I think Groupon was scaling under the assumption that their business model was social and that network effects would be generated somewhere down the road once they were at scale.  As we have seen, in mature Groupon markets where they are locally at scale, this has not occurred.<p>From my outside perspective, it seems that Living Social might be in a more sustainable place than Groupon (although I might be biased as I'm in their home market of DC).  They generated some goodwill by taking a smaller cut of deal revenue than Groupon and, anecdotally, do a better job at maintaining good relationships with their merchants.

The panel announced a pretty straightforward test as one ""filter"" that can rule out patentability for certain claims:<p>1.

The <i>CyberSource</i> panel distinguished this precedent by saying that, <i>as a practical matter,</i> that earlier method could <i>not</i> be performed by the human mind or with paper and pencil; see page 21 of the PDF.<p>[b] An unanswered question: How exactly are ordinary people supposed to determine whether a method can or can't be performed with paper and pencil ""as a practical matter""?<p>[c] Even if a method gets past the ""paper and pencil"" filter, there are still other filters to pass before it will be patentable---but once the Patent and Trademark Office has issued the patent, then a presumption of patentability applies.<p>COMMENT: This is an area where the net effect of the precedents is not entirely clear. It wouldn't surprise me if the court were to take this case <i>en banc,</i> namely to have all of the court's 12 judges rehear and redecide the case in an attempt to clarify the law.

Redis Cluster isn't out yet, and there doesn't seem to be any automated Master-Slave failover/recovery system, everything has to be done manually.<p>I'd think you could write a script to handle the Redis failover actions (promoting the Slave to Master, making sure the old Master comes back as a Slave if it comes back, etc...), tie it into heartbeat with a VIP, and have a very simple failover solution.  But I can't find anyone who's done that, much less released the script they're using for the Redis piece.<p>So far the advice I've gotten is either: you don't need automated failover - just do it manually when you get paged, wait for Redis Cluster - it'll be magical, or write your own client - and have it handle failover and manage the Redis actions.  None of these is viable imho.<p>What are you doing now to keep Redis from being a single point of failure in your infrastructure?",1313602058

To the extent that the incentives are wrong, these are the regulations, the aberrations that make things deviate from the free market.</i><p>It's fairly common for traders managing (or depending how you look at it, gambling) other people's money to be paid a percentage of the total money under management (for the sake of argument, let's say 0.5%) plus a much larger percentage (10%) of the upside.<p>That this leads to perverse incentives is, I hope, obvious to everyone here - I've literally sat down with traders and run best guess numbers incorporating the risk of getting fired (or losing investors, shutting down the fund, etc.), difficulty finding another gig doing the same thing vs. the potential gains, and the mathematical conclusion is almost always the same: go all-in, take on as much risk as you can possibly manage, and you'll do better personally than if you invested safely.  The only real question is a moral one, i.e. do you care enough about doing what's right to actually try to preserve your client's money rather than gamble it away for a shot at a bigger prize? [Interestingly enough, I've found that most do, the problem is that there's a small subset that don't give a shit, and their abuses taint the entire field]<p>This type of risk-seeking unquestionably played a role in the recent collapse, I don't really see how that can be denied - sure, government incentives triggered the initial housing market buildup and drop, but IIRC that was initially only a 4% correction, it was only because of how massively leveraged the financial sector had become w.r.t. credit that such a drop had any impact on anything at all.<p>Do you really think the payment incentives in the financial sector are helping the market work properly?  Or do you think that those payment schemes (a nibble of the principal and a chomp of the upside) are somehow caused by government meddling?<p>IMO, the problem is that it's a mistake to assume that the negative effects of ""government meddling"" end with official government.  <i>Any</i> time you put a group of people together and have them agree on rules and regulations, especially ones about how to distribute money amongst themselves, you run the risk of creating incentives where individually self-interested actions actually work against the group.

2896068,comment,2894240,2894240,6,0,dredmorbius,,,"I'm seeing a  fair number of hacker/fitness articles at HN, and there are some long-live well-known instances online (John Walker's ""Hacker Diet"", Jeremy Zawodny ""Diet Tips""). At the same time, there's a lot of naivet in many of the comments.<p>A few basic principles might be helpful here.<p><i>1: It's really not that complicated.</i> There are a few well-known principles of weight/fat gain and loss, cardiovascular fitness, and strength / hypertrophy (muscle building) training.  You'll get a long way with sound nutrition based on good food choices, appropriate caloric intake for your goals, and the right mix of both cardio and strength training modalities (methods).  A decent starting point is Liam Rosen's ""Beginners Guide"": <a href=""http://www.liamrosen.com/fitness.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.liamrosen.com/fitness.html</a>  Understand concepts such as SAID / training specificity, progressive overload, and caloric balance.<p><i>2: Do some research.</i>  The Wikipedia ""Strength Training"" article covers basics of sets, reps, weights, and rest periods for use in strength training. ExRx.net (<a href=""http://exrx.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://exrx.net</a>) has a lot of solid information and exercise guides. YouTube is a great resource for finding form videos (both good and bad) for exercises. Watching Olympic lifters is inspiring, watching ""fail"" vids has its own benefits....  Read Michael Pollan, Andrew Weil, and others on diet.  I'm not a nutrition nazi -- there are a huge range of native diets, people vary, and lifestyle demands vary, though I'd suggest minimizing the highly processed crap you eat (and a lot of foods you might not consider ""highly processed"" or ""crap"" are).  But go ahead and read Dean Ornish (low-fat), Atkins (low carb), Vegan (no animal products) classic old-school bodybuilding (BIG FOOD, high protein) sources. Figure out which seems most sensible and appropriate to you. Jack LaLanne got a ton of stuff right in the 1950s. Understand your basic macronutrients (carbs, protein, fats) and how they're used by your body.<p><i>3: Read a good book on fitness.</i> One of the best I've seen in the past decade is <i>The New Rules of Lifting</i> by Lou Schuler and Alwyn Cosgrove. It covers basics of fitness, nutrition, strength training, identifies six foundational exercises (squats, deads, lunges, ""push"" (presses), ""pull"" (rows/chins), and twist). Coverage of some of the more technical lifts (squats and deads) is limited, I'd suggest Mark Rippetoe's comprehensive and excellent <i>Starting Strength</i>, for this. I'm a fan too of a good 5x5 program (such as Rippetoe's or as you'll find at <a href=""http://www.stronglifts.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stronglifts.com/</a>).  ""New Rules"" includes a suite of training programs aimed at various goals, which others may like.  <i>Body for Life</i> is another good pick. There's considerable scholarly research on strength training as well, Google Scholar is a good place to do some digging (but don't obsess with minutia and details).<p><i>4: Realize that this is a long-term, lifetime project.</i> Start light, start short, start easy. But start. <i>Increase the intensity and duration of exercise gradually over time.</i>  Too many novices obsess over how much weight they should use, what intensity they should exercise at, or how long they should move.  <i>It doesn't matter</i>, and lighter/less is better initially.  The 5x5 programs above start light and add 5# per lift per workout (10# for deads).  Believe it or not, this is a rapid progression, and though the programs start very easy, they get challenging within a month or two.  You'll stick with them for 3-9 months typically, then switch programs according to your goals.<p><i>5: Training should be balanced.</i> This doesn't mean doing everything every day. It does mean that you want to include both strength and cardio, that nutrition <i>and</i> exercise matter. That you want to train your front <i>and</i> your back (no, pushups and crunches are <i>not</i> a comprehensive training program, and can lead to or exacerbate imbalances in the long run), your top <i>and</i> your bottom, multiple planes of motion (sagittal tends to dominate, transverse and frontal are neglected), varying rep/set/weight ranges (strength: 1-6, size: 8-12, endurance: 15+), both interval and long-duration cardio.  Compound/whole-body and freeweight lifts are generally preferred, though isolation movements have their place, especially in bringing up weak points or for rehab.  Bilateral (balanced) and unilateral (one-side at a time) movements.  Excesses in any one dimension can be bad (look up the bone-loss issues of competitive cyclists for some really interesting reading).<p><i>6: Rest and recovery matter.</i> Training is stimulus. Food is fuel. <i>Recovery is when your body adapts to stimulus with what you feed it.</i> Yes, you really <i>can</i> burn fat while you sleep (and do routinely).<p><i>7: Intensity matters.</i> If there's one error I see at gyms, it's working out at too little intensity, usually cardio, for too long. I can point you at a 4-minute workout that will 1) have you trying to get your lungs back inside you and 2) have very significant impacts on your cardio potential as measured by VO2 Max (it's called Tabata intervals, Google it). Yes, this is what that idiotic $14,000 SkyMall exercise thing is based on, but you can do 'em with minimal equipment -- jumprope or burpees -- among other alternatives.<p><i>8: Training should be goal-oriented.</i> Define your goals (usually something like ""lose fat"", ""gain muscle"", ""run faster"", ""get over this nagging <insert problem here> issue"". Find out what training modalities work best for this. If you're working with a trainer <i>ask WHY you're doing a particular exercise or training method.</i><p><i>9: You're not that special.</i> Premature optimization of fitness regimes is the heart of much fitness evil.  Start with a basic program. Especially as a novice, you'll make rapid gains -- and as a consequence, you'll think you've found the One True Way.  That's complete bullshit -- you've just experienced the Novice Effect (Google that).  As you progress toward goals, training specificity will increase -- you're tailoring your program to both your goals and your body's ability to adapt. You'll learn about training cycles (sets/reps, weekly, meso, and macro cycles).<p><i>10: There's a ton of fitness information on the InterWebs.</i> Some of it's silly/stupid/biased, some isn't. I've noted a few good starting points. T-Nation (mentioned by others) has an active forums section, as do other fitness sites. Share knowledge. It's not just for IT/CS problems.<p>Answering the original post: I'd say techies (or anyone) would benefit from a weekly exercise regime consisting of 2-4 days of whole-body freeweight training, a HIIT cardio session or two, and an endurance cardio session or two.  Addressing typical issues such as upper-cross syndrome, weak posterior chain, excess carb consumption, and generally neglected muscular strength, particularly lower-body (legs, glutes, spinal erectors) will matter.  How far you take this is up to you, but you'll be stronger, hurt less, do more, and as you get older (it will happen, eventually), look and feel better. Especially naked.",1313601641

For example both DOTA and HoN have an item which grants you 10 seconds of magic immunity on use, and can't be used again for more than 1 minute.

Rather, I simply don't enjoy the kamikaze rush that pays off maybe 80-95% of the time but looks like something out of a Hollywood action movie (this seems more the style where Crysis was targeted), but rather the reasoned, considered approach that works out 99.5% or higher (and might be a realistic approach if one were actually living in the game universe). Immersion just doesn't work for me if I can't do that.<p>So I don't like CoD and other linear shooters which present you with a series of scripted shooting galleries and a quota of targets to hit before allowing progress (it's utterly mindless); nor do I like (any more) the Quake / Doom style of horror ""surprises"", where long straight corridors and shadowy alcoves are near certain to contain unpleasant ambushes (it almost punishes foresight); and nor do I like Half-Life 2 and its episodes, which do not reward exploration or observation - every possible ""bad outcome"" is blatantly and repeatedly telegraphed, and almost every interesting alcove turns out to actually be the way forward because the obvious way forward turns out to be blocked: HL2+ are over-designed.<p>With more and more games focused towards consoles, lacking first person (I would have enjoyed GTA4 more if it were first person outside vehicles), and with ""crouch in cover mode"" features activated by dedicated controls (I thought ducking in and out of cover was part of the challenge?), I sometimes fear the depth I seek is getting harder to find. But I'm not sure. Games like the Thief series, Deus Ex, Far Cry 1 & 2, and modern RPGs like Oblivion and Fallout, are probably actually coming out with roughly the same regularity as always, just that memory compresses them.",1313601064

2895985,comment,2895133,2895889,14,0,drewcrawford,,,"IANAL either, but here's my armchair analysis:<p>1) Independently of whether a contract exists, the developer owns the IP.  By failing to pay at the agreed-upon time, (possibly even before that if you have a good lawyer) the entrepreneur is in material breach of any verbal contract that existed and in a material breach situation the developer has no obligation to ""perform"" (transfer the IP).  The developer is of course <i>entitled</i> to a legal remedy, that does not mean he is <i>obligated</i> to seek one--he has apparently chosen the remedy of open-sourcing the software.<p>2) Absent an in-force contract (see #1), the status of the copyright falls to statute, which says that if no money changed hands (and sometimes even if money changed hands), the developer retains the copyright.<p>3) Defamation in the US requires the plaintiff to prove the defendant's ""actual malice"".  If the developer is spouting a legal theory that he in fact believes to be true, a belief that would survive a preliminary hearing, he's not being malicious.  Lawyers don't get defamation lawsuits for advocating a legal theory.  He is probably wise not to name the entrepreneur to avoid a lawsuit, but that does not mean he would be by necessity a libeler.",1313600471

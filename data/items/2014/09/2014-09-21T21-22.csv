Neither of these reflects the software engineering practices that were taught to most of us at MIT.  Perhaps he picked it up from hanging around some of the older hackers who were used to working with extremely limited machine resources.<p>Certainly in its early days, GNU Emacs was criticized for excessive resource consumption by people who were trying to run it on relatively small machines (&quot;Eight Megabytes And Constant Swapping&quot; was one joke I recall).  Perhaps RMS was influenced by these criticisms; and probably, the Lucid developers did not feel quite so constrained, given their market.  In any case, it&#x27;s been a very long time since 8MB was a lot.  It&#x27;s funny to me now, when I occasionally use one of the fancy IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, to see how XEmacs is now the lightweight, fast choice by comparison.

The global state is still the cornerstone of the 4.5.

 i like the multi line gap interlacing idea: each individual gap creating its designated frame; but i wonder if you&#x27;ve considered scanning the lines from the middle out in both directions.. is this possible? hardware changes? one upsetting realisation with the oculus was the importance of both neck to skull mobility as well as eye rotation mobility, if my vision is focused at the center and blurred in the periphery i need something moving both with my pupils as well as my skull, but since your tech has yet to offer a way to do this it could easily exploit its own limitations by just scanning those lines from middle out as it already assumes i am looking straight ahead at the screen, also at 33 minutes you talk about the importance of resolution..?<p>.<p>23:00~ :: position tracking :: vision purity is a heartbreaking itch.. i&#x27;ve spent very little time thinking about the issue of position tracking.. i left the tracker unplugged for a long time in the early days of using the device, i only really plugged it in in order to assume a position of solidarity with the project as it is, hopefully only for now, in its entirity.. only thought i&#x27;ve had is embedded seems necessary.. i&#x27;ll be looking at a blade of grass and as i get closer to it, getting down on the ground to really look at and around then suddenly i will leave the field of view for the tracker and be jarringly thrown into some default position until i adjust and i&#x27;m picked up again and placed back at my actual position<p>.<p>33:00~ :: resolution :: interesting to come back to this later and from an opposing position.. i think this sort of developmental focus contradiction is necessary to simultaneously improve multiple aspects of the experience<p>.<p>40:00~ :: stereo pano :: this sounds like me arguing with my math teacher in highschool how calculus is &#x27;just a hack&#x27;, a practical hack that has giving us signifigant comforts from the technology it affords, but most assuredly a hack.. the head tilt problem sounds like an area for fascinating research, also sounds like a capture problem, the photographer, that when figured will become a display problem, the stereo display tech.. perhaps you could usurp the capture solution by messing around with light field cameras like lytro? and solve the display issues before capture shows you you have them<p>.<p>42:00~ :: stereo pano cirque demo  :: i like the incorporation of positional audio, this reminded me of the scene in guardians when rocket is disciplining a defeated drax:&#x27;we&#x27;ve all got dead people&#x27;; this was the first scene in a 3d movie where i felt like the set was built with 3d in mind, the practical effects seemed to catch up with the digital, shedding their historic bindings to the theatre, and i was impressed and excited about the future of 3d movies for the first time<p>.<p>48:37 :: benchmarking :: &#x27;i&#x27;m sure i could write a benchmark that could win relative to something else&#x27;.. that is the single most hilarious and excellent sentence in regard to benchmarking that i have ever heard, love it<p>.<p>50:00~ :: cardboard :: cardboard is interesting, i read it the first time as a sort of commentary`derision`joke by googs to bacefook for buying oculus, but the execution was so well done and thought out that it almost redeemed itself, and in reality the cardboard makes you appreciate the oculus more.. i think stereoscopy is innately flawed and with the cardboard you can see the limitations and shortcomings outright which effectively shows how well the oculus hides its flaws<p>.<p>1:06:00~ :: thermal :: the thermal seems a greater problem for gear than oculus, why the gear placed a shell around the phone stead some clip in feature seemed to aggressively deny this as an issue, but hearing how much you are concerned and interested in thermal issues makes me wonder if samsung&#x27;s agreement with oculus has tied you all to their gear interests or what are your motivating affects? i understand the whole whats good on mobile is great on`for pc but still..<p>.<p>1:10:00~ :: up vectors :: &#x27;breaking what we want to accomplish in vr&#x27;.. i&#x27;m sorry i disagree with you on this one, hard coding any elements of the experience is going to make for a bad user experience, have your interests as defaults but allow users to use it as they want, i want to lay on my back and have my virtual up vector orthagonal to my meat space up vector, sometimes, sometimes we make unreasonable descisions but i want to be able to.. like laying on my back watching a movie, thankfully the whirligig player allows me to orient the screen to whatever angle regardless of the positional trackers&#x27; understanding of my virtual orientation<p>.<p>1:11:40 :: async time warp :: &#x27;you win arguments by showing an existence proof&#x27;, excellent<p>.<p>1:22:00~ :: eye slicing :: un chien andalou<p>.<p>1:27:00+ :: questions<p>.\n 1:35:00~ :: lenses :: i look forward to seeing your non-circular lens implementation, the idea of rendering more than throwing away the excess is the optimal way to develop<p>.<p>thank you for your time, and effort<p>.<p>.. edit :: gramm`err",1411336162

What makes it worse is not being able to build a large enough developer community around the product. If Parse would only listen to the developers using their platform, take constructive feedback and improve their offering it will go long way. The response from Parse when things are bought to attention is much to be desired. Part of the problem is Parse needs to solve is to partner with companies/developers to help out their customers with the common issues that people face when using their platform and concentrate on the real issues of the platform. This should also help them with their support as well, which is bad even for paying customers.

The more predictable a story is, the less information it adds and the less interesting it is.<p>There&#x27;s a reason we say &quot;<i>intellectually</i> interesting&quot; to describe the stories HN wants. There are different kinds of interesting. For example, we all have an interest in the things we&#x27;re personally invested in or identify with, but that is not intellectual interest.<p>Similarly, as humans we&#x27;re highly interested in what other humans are up to, but that—think gossip and celebrity news—is not intellectual interest either. So a story can be interesting without being a good fit for HN, quite apart from the fact that we don&#x27;t all have intellectual interests in common.<p>Maybe this explains why upvotes alone don&#x27;t work for a site like HN. We upvote the things that excite our interest. It&#x27;s too much work to pause and ask ourselves what kind of interest we&#x27;re experiencing.

And I&#x27;d be interested to see a source for them other than the likes of the Free Republic or the Nation.<p>You also say, <i>&quot;As to free speech -- well, I see this as a classic example of modern government&#x27;s basic strategy, which is to find out what people are going to do anyway, order them to do it, then try to take credit for the outcome.&quot;</i><p>Look at the history of the Free Speech movement.  The students involved in those protests weren&#x27;t ordered by the government to protest.  Quite the contrary, they were bloodily opposed every step of the way.  So I&#x27;m not sure what makes you say otherwise.<p>Of course, success has a million fathers and failure none.  So it&#x27;s no surprise that everyone would try to take credit for it now.  But I&#x27;m not sure how this is supposed to discredit the original movement itself.<p>Please enlighten me.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health</a><p>[4] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour</a><p>[5] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action</a><p>[6] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_Unit...</a><p>[7] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_...</a><p>[8] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Movement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Movement</a><p>[9] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_President_Now"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_President_Now</a><p>[10] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid</a><p>[11] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement</a>",1411334792

Total rewrites for the right reasons and with _a right team_ can be great (i.e. better abstractions, better understood domain requirements which can lead to a more simple, better codebase, enable features that were not feasible before, and so on). Succintly: If the theory of the existing system is still understood well enough and the team understands the domain requirements and has experience of implementing similar systems then a rewrite can be a great idea (ref Naur: &#x27;Programming as theory building&#x27; on what the theory of the system means as a concept and what are it&#x27;s implications). For specific businesses, total rewrites can be startup-level risky and should be done due to specific domain requirements. I think this is usually what is meant by the &#x27;bad idea&#x27; meme. Joel Spolsky wrote of this at some point and gave example of Netscape&#x27;s rewrite attempt. His advice of &quot;don&#x27;t do it&quot; was highly context dependent, though.<p>When we discuss of creating a new industry standard API, we are not discussing of a single rewrite. There are a few typical patterns how these are done: &#x27;fostering&#x27; an existing tech stack under a public institution or developing the API publicly.The public API development usually consists of two  parts - agreeing on the theory of the API and implementing one or more reference implementations of the said API at the same time by member institutions.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to gauge the risk of this public API development. There are costs for member organisations but usually they are insignificant when compared to the size of an institution. There is usually no established product whose feature development and support stagnates because of this but rather the development is done to facilitate potential future products and features. Of course, the API adoption can fail (ref. for example OpenVG) but that fait can befall any new development for any number of reasons.",1411334455

It does a disservice to pretend that software engineering is somehow not as difficult a technical discipline simply because it has a low barrier to entry and credentials are a dubious proxy for any appreciable skill in the discipline.<p>The reason programmers deserve to be called engineers is because software, especially large systems are as merciless in their cause and effect as the real world.  Just as a civil engineer has to master the physics to make a bridge stand up, software engineers have to deal with the unforgiving nature of the logic engine and all the abstraction layers built on top of it.  But unlike physics which never changes, the hardware and software substrate that programmers work with is constantly in flux.  All of it is layers upon layers of predicate logic concocted from the minds of other programmers. It is as if the very rules of the physical universe were themselves variable and invented by other engineers.  Given this kind of environment, and also the diverse applications to which software can be applied (any thought as opposed to any physical object), it&#x27;s no wonder that software engineering does not have agreed upon branches and standard academic credentials.",1411334296

The Cincinnati Stroke Scale, often seen in public health campaigns as &quot;FAST&quot;, provides three simple, quick assessments that can reliably delineate a majority of strokes.  It is the standard for basic EMTs as well.  More advanced providers should perform a more comprehensive exam, testing all the cranial nerves (actually usually just II through XII).  A more formalized, advanced stroke scale is the NIH stroke scale: <a href=""http://stroke.nih.gov/documents/NIH_Stroke_Scale.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stroke.nih.gov/documents/NIH_Stroke_Scale.pdf</a><p>While there are often some kind of neurologic deficit associated with a stroke, the goal standard is, of course, a CT or CTA that should be administered immediately upon arrival in the ED of a suspected stroke (depending on the presentation of symptoms an exam by a neurologist may occur first).<p>The symptoms described in this story would absolutely make me think this person was having a stroke if she had verbalized them to someone with my training.<p>It&#x27;s also worthwhile to point out that the person having a stroke may not realize they are having a stroke.  People may have the obvious symptoms - slurred speech and hemiparesis - and refuse to acknowledge that these problems exist, because, in their mind, they don&#x27;t.<p>If you think someone is having a stroke, record the time you first noticed symptoms and call 911 immediately.",1411333925

If you&#x27;ve done some programming you might know that you cannot really have global mutable state together with parallel execution, yet the global mutable state is the core of OpenGL. So you need to copy the state every time you launch a draw call, which is an expensive thing to do even with the hardware aids available. Definitely more expensive than just launching parallel draws each with its own state.<p>Not just the OpenGL is suffering from this, DirectX has very similar problem up to DX11, the DX12 is out to address this.<p>There are extensions that allow you to do the same in OpenGL but then what would be a point to bring the entire OpenGL if you are only going to use the extension that is nothing like the OpenGL and does the same the native API already does?",1411333540

I'm on what you might call my 'second startup' at 23, but the main reason why my first one wasn't successful was that I didn't give it enough time to grow up and become it's own thing.<p>A startup is a serious commitment.  At that age, I didn't understand that it was going to take time to actually grow the thing.  I think it's something that a lot of people don't grasp.  Instead we have 'startups' over the weekend, 'startups' that get abandoned when the next shiny idea comes along, and 'three startups before 18'.<p>I don't know that there's a way to have that many failures that young if you actually made an honest go of all of them.<p>Here's an entry out of my personal journal that I think applies here:<p>'Something Untrue'<p>When I was nineteen, I had my shiny idea I was working on. I’d written some software that proxied the iTunes Music Store, displaying third party content via the iTunes Music Store interface. You had to download and install the software, it required root privileges to install, there was no clear reason why looking at something in the iTMS was better than looking at it in a browser, it was hard to explain to non-technical people, there was no clear way other than advertising to make money out of it, etc. In other words, though it was a cool hack, it was a bad product.<p>I launched it, made a little splash, got a few news articles, and silently faded away. A few months later I just shut the whole thing down. Didn’t even bother to renew the domain name.<p>The biggest thing that’s stuck with me from the experience is how it wasn’t an overnight success. I wasn’t prepared to spend the couple of years on it that it would have taken to build up a really vibrant community and product. I wasn’t ready to iterate a few dozen times until I had something that really was worth taking the time to install and use.<p>I can’t help but wonder if this comes from our schooling where we work for weeks on a project, hand it in, and then get our A+ or our F back in one definitive stroke of a red pen. There’s no building upon previous work. You get the idea that a work, once presented to an audience, is immutable and complete.<p>And that’s just not true.",1273647025

1340343,comment,1339743,1339743,0,0,tzs,,,"1. Tell your client to immediately switch to another service provider for his online store. When the current one gets hacked (note I said <i>when</i>, not <i>if</i>), your client's customers aren't going to care that it was a third party provider your client was using. They will look at it as they trusted your client and that trust was betrayed.<p>2. Perhaps an anonymous tip to Visa and Mastercard would be in order. The provider needs to be shut down, as what they are doing goes beyond any excusable security failure. Almost every developer, no matter how good, can botch security--and so if all they were leaking was credit card numbers, names, addresses, and phone number, it would be at least remotely forgivable, if they were to promptly fix it.<p>However, you said they have the CVV too. That is not supposed to be stored at all. Of course, an online store site has to keep it for the duration of processing the transaction, but that should only be a few minutes. The fact that they are storing CVV shows that they are beyond redemption.<p>3. As for the numbers and other data you downloaded, secure delete it. I doubt anyone is going to care much about it. I once had a file with about the same number of card numbers and contact information, which I received unsolicited, offered up as a sample of the 100k cards the sender wanted to sell me. I was able to do some checking and determine that the information was apparently legit.<p>I called Visa and (I think) American Express. I naively thought they would be interested in putting immediate holds on the accounts. Nope. The FBI was not interested either--they suggested that the Secret Service would be the appropriate agency to deal with someone trafficking in stolen credit cards. The Secret Service disagreed.

This could have been made much nicer in html/javascript.<p>I'm using OSX with a resolution of 1920 x 1200 and the pictures are tiny in the middle of my screen. It also looks like the quality has been compromised to enable the flash to  keep its file size down.<p>Great idea, could have been implemented better.<p>Edit: Its all about the photography. I want to be blown away by the pictures, not struggling with the implementation.",1273644501

Particularly people who intend to sell their car on rather than drive it until it falls apart.  EA are effectively increasing depreciation on their games.<p>I would guess that a good number of players who sell their old games use the money to buy new games.  This move will definitely push the price of EA's used games down, I would guess by close to $10 for games with significant online content.  Which means that EA's primary customers (the people buying the new games) now have $10 less to invest in their new game for every old game that they sell.  I can't see people increasing their spend on new games to compensate for this, so the net result could be that EA get more money from used sales, which is more or less balanced out by getting less money from new sales.",1273644422
1340304,comment,1340153,1340153,0,0,malbs,,,"The article was interesting to me because I have a friend who is a Prison Guard. He regularly tells stories about working in the system, about the prisoners, and about his work mates.<p>With the prison system here in Australia, he says there is a genuine drive to get rid of hard-ass prison officers, and replace them with what he calls ""yes men"", who will back down from any potential engagement with prisoners, because it is essentially bad publicity for the prison system, and the media loves to jump on prison violence (especially caused by the guards). In this the guards are already coming from a weak position because the inmates can actually use the media attention to their advantage<p>Anyways I'm getting off track, but my mate refers to himself as part of the old school system, where if you care to break the rules at all, it will be met with swift and violent retribution at the guards hands in the form of some sort of midnight visit. This is all being phased out though, as I already mentioned in the previous paragraph.<p>Also, the inmates definitely know the system, and know how to get around the justice system - There was a recent riot in the local prison here, where the prisoners attacked two of the guards, but even though the prisoners knew there was CC TV on them, they simply covered their faces with towels as to avoid identification. Now the guards could identify them based on mannerisms on camera (the way they walked/moved, used weapons), however it didn't go to trial because the the video was the only evidence, and a prosecution would never get a jury to convict because mannerisms would never be enough to identify the perpetrators. Kind of a long winded way of saying the prisoners know what they can get away with, very well. I asked him what would have happened if the prisoners had actually killed one of the guards, and he said well they would have got away with murder.<p>Scary place, he certainly earns his 90k per year. Sorry for the long winded response!",1273644406

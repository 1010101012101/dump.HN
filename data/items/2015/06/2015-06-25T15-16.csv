Utilizing one of these technologies would have allowed FogCreek to focus on what they do best, make software. Instead, they took a proprietary uni-platform language and attempted all on their own to make it cross-platform capable - which led to years of maintainability issues.<p>> It lasted 10 years<p>They gained an early advantage of not having to throw out the codebase and start over, yet they bought themselves 10 years of technical debt which continued to pose a burden on the small company. Many would argue that biting the bullet early on and switching to an open, community-driven cross-platform language/environment would have yielded much more return on the initial investment.<p>> When they transitioned off of it, they did it not with a rewrite, but with mechanical translation<p>Yes, that is an achievement, but again, for the wrong reasons.",1435247986

As such, I don&#x27;t particularly take issue with the removal of the flag from public institutions.

As someone in the design world I am very aware of this. Perhaps your experience is that everyone around you who sports the flag is an overt racist, but that hasn&#x27;t been the experience for me.

However, most implementations use an exponential strategy, so for a million item vector grown one at a time, you&#x27;d see only 10-20 reallocs. Which is to say, the realloc problem is only a problem in memory constrained -- think embedded or kernel -- systems where a memory overhead of 1.5-2x isn&#x27;t viable.<p>You can do the same thing -- and some linked list implementations do -- with linked lists, where you grab a block of nodes at a time. If you don&#x27;t though, just in inserts, the vector will be faster. Mallocs are non-trivial in most applications and can easily become the bottleneck.<p>I think the thing you might be underestimating is how much faster it is to iterate over a vector than a linked list, nevermind random access. Cache issues really, really do matter. If you want to see this in action and happen to have a SoC dev board around, disable the data cache and run some benchmarks with vectors. If you re-enable it, you will easily see a 10x-20x improvement.<p>If you watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo</a>, he goes into some of the use cases and some benchmarks that might be compelling to you.",1435245432

Y'know?<p>I can see how that might lead to a long dark night of the soul, but who wants to read about it -- when it's written so hamfistedly?",1254481129

I hadn't thought of keeping all of the quoted original as a backup, because I don't bother to cover my six.  If someone wants to call me out, as has happened, I quote the entire exchange and add a context-sensitive summary and commentary.<p>I'll think about keeping the original, but for me, I don't think it will be relevant.<p>Oh, and I up-mud you, so I don't know who down-mud you.

Someone who answers yes to that even when in practice they tend downgrade the value of it is involved in an important exchange. They are showing the interviewer that they respect their priorities. And if they are hired, they have set an expectation.<p>These discussions set an agenda. It's weaker that than the contracts you'll sign, but far stronger than nothing at all. And it is a useful filter for excluding people with a different worldview who are not going to work in the team.<p>I've disqualified myself in a couple of interview cycles for not playing the game on gang of four patterns. Yes, I could sit down and memorise them and pretend it was important, no I'm going to because that sets an agenda that is too far away from the way I work.

856735,comment,856029,856029,0,0,Tichy,,,"The only reason I see why people would complain about adblockers is rather destructive: because I have to suffer (seeing ads), everybody else should have to suffer, too. Other than that, I really don't understand - does the advertiser get his value if I see the ad even though I hate it?<p>Seems to me rather the opposite: since I hate ads enough to bother installing an ad blocker, seeing an ad might actually induce <i>negative</i> feelings towards that company in me (perhaps psychology can prove me wrong, but my feeling is that ads can affect me in a negative way). Also, since I sure as hell will <i>never</i> click on those ads, showing them to me anyway will bring the clickthrough rate of the site down. So it might also be a net loss for the site owner, who has to sell the ads for less.<p>Looking at an ad is <i>not</i> the same as paying for something. It is not a productive action. By giving somebody money, something productive has taken place (I produced something to earn that money, receiver can pay somebody else to produce something). Looking at an ad on the other hand is purely destructive - my time was simply wasted, I did  not produce anything in the time I wasted with the ad.",1254479974
856734,comment,856688,856720,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"As the author, I've done a poor job of communicating. For that, I apologize.<p>Nobody is at fault here. Let me be perfectly clear about this. The question is what types of lessons to learn from interactions with other people. You're never, ever going to learn the exact motives of everybody you interact with. In each of these cases, multiple attempts were made to understand and communicate motives, paradigms, and worldviews. These attempts failed.<p>In the first case, the conversation is unfinished. It's the preface to the article. In the second case, teams can't live in chaos. ""Rusty"" wasn't wrong, it's just we needed to communicate about things and were both unable to do it for various reasons. In the third case, ""Jim"" was just an amazing piece of work. If it was just me then that's one thing, but everybody had the same opinion of him. So I don't think it's anything I'm bringing to the table. I could tell you stories of several other people who had the same experience with Jim, but that's just beating up on Jim. From Jim's point of view, the rest of the world was wrong. Here he was, obviously with the answer to the problems we had, and we weren't reasonable enough to let him solve everything. (I know this because he said as much to me on a couple of occasions)<p>In the fourth case, I screwed up. I took liberties with my language and reaction that I hadn't earned yet. No amount of communication is going to fix an initial bad impression.<p>The purpose of this article isn't to slam other people or to say that people with hidden motives are somehow bad. If that's all you got out of it I really did a poor job. The purpose is to review various people that didn't like me and explore why.<p>You can monday-morning quarterback this thing to death -- I know, because I have. But at the end of the day, conditions are always imperfect, everybody is always acting the best way they know how, and still you end up not getting along with some people. That's just life.<p>Of course I'll never know the entire story -- and all you have is my side of things. But I don't blame these people, look down on them, or anything like that. Sometimes, as the article concludes, shit happens. It's impossible to get along with everybody you meet.<p>You can say ""forget it, I'm not worrying about it"" or you can obsess over it. The best thing to do, in my opinion, is try to find some kind of narrative to put over it that teaches you a valuable lesson. It's not a perfect solution, but it allows growth without demonizing others or putting yourself down. It's a certainty that the narrative is going to be incomplete and trivializing of certain things, but that's also unavoidable.",1254479798

856732,comment,855588,855833,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"A lot of ""narrow AI"" (what real AI researchers spend their time doing) has made its way into a lot of products. However I doubt this is what you were thinking of as pure AI.<p>There's more, though. Neuroscience continues piecing together how brains work. I've heard that the brain's embodied algorithms are recognizable from eg computer vision research. This seems to imply that there is more of a natural ramp-up from ""narrow AI"" into ""humanlike AI"" than at first it would appear.",1254479499

856725,comment,856558,856558,0,0,jeromec,,,"If you're a programmer this can be troublesome because a focused mind is what is needed to be productive, whereas you could get away with many other types of work while letting your mind wander. I think the best approach depends on the type of problem(s), but many problems, like emotional ones, may need time to get better. One thing I always try to remember is that nothing lasts forever - good or bad. This can be a comfort in bad times.<p>A technique I use to be productive as a programmer is to try and finish a section of work in half the time. This mental demand won't let the mind wander. Promise yourself a reward at the end (such as being allowed to slack off at HN for a while ;). This works for both problems and procrastination, and can give you a positive boost for having accomplished a task. Try to break your workload (and problem solutions if possible) into smaller chunks to deal with, otherwise you can easily feel overwhelmed.",1254479074

856720,comment,856688,856688,0,0,gdp,,,"Wow.  I don't know if it's just a literary device being employed here, but this article comes off as the work of somebody with a lack of empathy.<p>Through the description of the actions of each of the people with whom he disagrees, I immediately found myself sympathising with the ""other side"".  I mean, there are the usual dailywtf-style ""this guy is really dumb/awful to work with/whatever"" stories, and we all get a bit of a laugh out of them, but this just comes across as a situation where the author is unable to grasp why other people might behave towards him in these ways, or feel particular feelings towards him.<p>> <i>I honestly don't know what interests me more, why Bob doesn't want to recommend me or why I thought Bob would recommend me when he won't. I think the second question has a lot more potential than the first!</i><p>Sure, the second question is more interesting, but I don't think this article goes any distance towards attempting to answer it.<p>People behave in particular ways for reasons that seem apparent to them.  The tone of this article annoys me because it appears to suggest that people who behave according to motivations that are hidden from the author are somehow at fault.<p>I just think this is symptomatic of so many of my experiences within the IT industry - people always assume that their own motives are pure and good, and that everyone else is acting dishonestly (to screw the client, or to avoid doing work, or to advance their own career).  I much prefer to assume that if I don't understand somebody's motivations, the burden is on me to try to understand, rather than just writing them off as bad/lazy/dishonest/whatever.",1254478746

Sure, there are people who claim to be scientists, but the scientific method is an exercise in pure rationality.</i><p>You would do best to rephrase that statement in far less concrete terms, because scientists (more specifically -- ""scientists"" trying to answer ""why"" and ""how"" our existence came about) are hardly playing in the arena of complete and total rationality.<p>As I linked before, scientists far smarter than myself have noted that the rational scientific method used in empirical observation oversteps its \nrational boundaries when it attempts to answer existential questions -- those are the only real questions that are even disputed between religion and science.  No intelligent religious person questions the complete rationality of empirical observation and the scientific method behind that, so the only domain were talking about here is that which is under dispute.<p>In this domain of dispute between religion and science, where it's pretty evident both world-views are in fact NOT completely rational (i.e. conjecturing about the unobservable and unmeasurable), it would only be fair to say that neither the scientist or religious believer has a completely rational answer that explains their own existence.  This is a distinct difference from how the scientist and religious believer are subjectively viewed as concretely rational vs. irrational, when it is crystal clear that is not the true big picture of the differing world-views.<p>Nevertheless, the major problem here is that these questions of existence are answered in the name of Science.  The common person understands science to be the authority on all things rational, because they've seen it in practical use on all things <i>empirical</i>.  The only problem is that most fail to realize that the scientific method only has true rational authority in the domain of the empirical.  Can't you see the inherent problem here?  Science has no more authority in answering existential questions than any other world-view, because all of science's rational authority comes from the empirical, where things can be measured, observed, modified, etc.",1234221568

Elton John and Billy Joel's upcoming tour have tickets going for $200 and $100.<p>But the main reason is risk management -- why take a risk with high priced tickets when you can be sure that the scalpers can guarantee you a sellout at the profit margin you're comfortable with?

My Rutgers site (one page, edu domain), was de-listed for a couple of weeks (didn't exist, even when I specified ""site:rutgers.edu""), then just re-appeared. I also noticed this with Oliver Steele's functional.js page - I was used to typing ""functional js"" into Google to find it, and at one point, it disappeared for a week or two from ranking alltogether, only to mysterious re-appear again.<p>Maybe it's some clever way to check whether or not people track their SEO? De-list sites, and watch if the person reverts to an earlier version of the page, or submits it for Google to crawl?",1234220749
474340,comment,474110,474242,0,0,fallentimes,,,"I think that's where things will eventually be, but the ticket industry moves very very slow. For sports, teams often sell tickets below market price for cash flow purposes. Season ticket holders often have to pay the entire balance upfront before the season even starts and independent of the team's performance. Also, if face value goes up too high their can be (and has been) a fan and media backlash. Also, many stadium agreements are set up so that a team makes more money from merchandise & concessions than ticket proceeds. In the NFL, if you don't sell out you run the risk of TV blackout; this also causes downward pressure on prices.<p>Concert tickets are a different beast since bands don't acquire win & loss records, but the public perception of face value still applies. During the season, prices can vary dramatically based on how good a team is playing. For example, Lions and Rams tickets we're going for $5 by season end. However, this almost never happens with bands on tour unless they require a reputation for sucking live. Also, what Ticketmaster doesn't make very public is that they often split their ""convenience fees"" with the artist.",1234220577

Then you do some kind of multiple regression.<p>What you are doing is building a very high-level, black-box model finding maximum likelihood parameters to fit some observed data.
Each underlying data point is a slice of a snapshot of the behavior of a very complex system.<p>This is worthwhile insofar as we can account for variance that we might see in future samples and can therefore predict and confirm that we have an understanding of the system. <i>It doesn't actually give us visibility into the complex system</i> because regression terms rarely correspond to anything concrete. This offers only the vaguest possible constraint on attempts to decompose the overall effect into causal factors.<p>The weights in the regression do not, individually, have a meaningful interpretation outside of the model.

Then I came along.<p>I look like my parents, think like my parents and in many ways, behave like my parents. However, I have outright rejected their religious beliefs (so there are some differences, but these could be the lack on indoctrination or maybe circumstance.
My sister met her biological mother for the first time when my sister was 23.  They both smoked, wore similar clothes, had similar musical tastes, similar social past times - in just about every way, they were very alike. More importantly, my sister is almost nothing like me, despite the very similar nurture/environment.
My brother was a very similar story, always in trouble with the law.
My parents had a strict policy, if one got something, we all got it. However, they recognized strengths and nurtured those.
So we have a family whose genetics have driven our looks, personalities, interests, careers (if you consider crime a career for my brother) and in my view, intelligence was also varied.
Adoption did not influence my siblings as far as I can see (by comparison with biological parents). All I have ever seen in my life in nature, nature, nature.
To add to this, we all have kids, and guess what? Our kids are all similar to their parents too. Looks/behavior and again, I'd argue intelligence.
Having said all of that, we are all intelligent in our own ways. As an example, my brother is very street wise- he's a great manipulator, a player. He can handle himself in many situations.
I fundamentally reject any urgument that nature plays no part in any aspect of what makes a person, including intelligence. Do you think the similarities end with looks?",1342561772

Still, there's the incentive to sign off on two random resumes and collect $100.

That's true, but well-designed languages tend to help keep people off that path - or at least do a better job of doing so. PHP is not one of those languages, hence the need for a ""PHP the Right Way"".<p>As asserted in the post, PHP is indeed used on a ton of websites. Most of these websites were written when PHP <i>was</i> the best tool for the job. But languages evolve. Other languages have learned the lessons of PHP and improved upon it.<p>PHP has done a fine job of ""modernizing"" itself lately, but it's still stuck with a lower quality overall design than some of the alternatives, and those alternatives have kept moving forward at the same time too. It reminds me a lot of IE's ""look, we've implemented that thing that the good browsers had 3 years ago"" announcements. It's great that PHP is not standing still, and that continued improvement must be awesome for existing projects that are built on PHP.<p>But for me, starting new projects in 2012, there's zero compelling case for using PHP, just as there are many old languages that would have been ""the"" choice once upon a time, but are now replaced by better things.",1342561717

4258081,comment,4257429,4257429,6,0,jazzychad,,,"Hi Dalton,<p>Honestly, I am conflicted about this endeavor. As a current App.net customer/user, I was very confused about the original announcement because the idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the current App.net product. So now I am worried that App.net as I understand it today might go away if you head in this new direction (I see in the FAQ you will support the current product for a year).<p>On the one hand, I am over Twitter. Done. It is way too noisy now, and I have been severely burned by their dev ecosystem. I put in so much time and effort (naively, I admit), and the aftertaste is super bitter. You and I have talked about this before at length, so I won't go into detail. That level of ecosystem-scorching has made me hesitant to put a lot of time and effort into something new and similar. This may be unfounded since I know you are wanting to do the right thing by your developers, but still the soreness remains and affects my judgement.<p>There are other non-ad-supported systems for this type of communication out there. Some are federated (status.net), some are not (heello.com). You and I both watched the immediate demise and shaming of heello. How will this be different? Perhaps it is the pay-to-play nature that will keep the trolls out at the start.<p>On the other hand, I can see where this would be very useful if it was in fact implemented correctly as an actual real-time feed platform. Using a combination of webhooks (pubsubhubbub) and data-streams (e.g. twitter streaming API), this could be a really powerful platform for developers, builders, and makers to finally bring about The Internet of Things that many have been dreaming about. I am worried that this is such a niche desire of a few inventive hackers that there won't be enough support behind it to sustain it as a centralized company (however, I don't see how an open, federated system is sustainable in this fashion either, so).<p>I know you are very passionate about this problem. We've discussed it before. I know this is something that you want to see exist, and so as a fellow builder and maker you are insanely driven to see it become a reality. I understand this drive. I just don't want it to derail your company :)<p>I don't know. I'm excited but hesitant. I have not backed the project yet because I'm still not sure... I have a lot of thoughts in this space as well, so maybe we should talk in person. I will be watching the progress intently!",1342561319

The problem is how easy it is to instantly distract yourself. <i>Taktaktaktaktak</i> ""Oh hey, I wonder if so-and-so replied on my Facebook, let's just to a quick look.."" <i>5 hours later</i> ""Oh snap, the time just flew by!""<p>If you're serious about blocking yourself from parts of the Internet, do it comprehensively. Here's what I do.<p>Most of the advice on this page is blocking from the browser-level or OS-level. This is easy to bypass, and you have to configure every device. You need to work at the router-level.<p>Let's talk blocking. A complete blacklist is wrong, you still need some Internet to Google or ask for help. e.g. stackoverflow.com, etc. Similarly, whitelists don't work because you can't possibly list every site you may need access to -- you may not know they exist yet. You need a keyword-matching blacklist.<p>You need two things:<p>1. WRT54GL router ($20-$50)
2. Tomato firmware: <a href=""http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato/</a><p>Vendor firmware usually has access restrictions, but they usually limit it to like 10 websites, and it usually doesn't have pattern-matching. You need a 3rd party firmware like Tomato.<p>Install the firmware per instructions from its website. It's really easy. The firmware has a page called ""Access Restrictions"". It does keyword blacklists/whitelists. You can block yourself for only certain hours of certain days. Here is an easy video tutorial from their website to guide you: <a href=""http://www.polarcloud.com/v/screst.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.polarcloud.com/v/screst.htm</a><p>For example, one keyword I use is ""news"". BAM! All URLs with the word ""news"" instantly blocked. Good. I don't need to be reading news when I should be coding. Resources like stackoverflow.com don't usually put ""news"" in their URLs, so they're safe.<p>There is the problem of unplugging the uplink from the router and directly into your computer (bypassing the router), or simply reconfiguring the router without restrictions. If you lack that much self-control, which I can understand (as I do too!!!), I recommend locking your router in a electrical enclosure and throwing away the key. Ok, not really. I made a cron job for the router that changes its login password to gibberish at some hour of the day, and X minutes prior it sets it to my normal password. Thus, I have X minutes of access to the router per day, should I need it.",1342559218

This authority ranking would surely have expert input initially, but I would expect that Citeseer and Google Scholar may be good places to look for inspiration on ways to crowdsource authority rankings.<p>For starters look at the Page Rank paper (named after Larry Page, not web page).  Academic papers need something richer than page rank, but since tens of billion of web pages can be ranked for arbitrary queries, the volume of academic papers should be fime.<p>Ranking algorithms are one of my favorite subjects, and they are as challenging as they are important. ""Search"" has little to do with actual searching, it's really a ranking problem. Google's search was the first good ranking scheme for internet search, and their ""I feel lucky"" button was a way to show that off.<p>Happy to discuss by email.",1342558869

The publication by Deary and Johnson you link to was published in 2009. I was quoting a more recent publication by Wendy Johnson, a frequent co-author with Deary at Edinburgh, in one of my other replies in this thread. Here are a couple of publications by Deary, Johnson, and various co-authors with more recent publication dates than what you have kindly linked:<p>The review article ""The neuroscience of human intelligence differences"" by Deary and Johnson and Penke (2010)<p><a href=""http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Deary_Penke_Johnson_2010_-_Neuroscience_of_intelligence_review.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Deary_Penke_Johnson_2010_-_Neur...</a><p>""At this point, it seems unlikely that single genetic loci have major effects on normal-range intelligence. For example, a modestly sized genome-wide study of the general intelligence factor derived from ten separate test scores in the cAnTAB cognitive test battery did not find any important genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms or copy number variants, and did not replicate genetic variants that had previously been associated with cognitive ability[note 48].""<p>Johnson, Penke, and Spinath (2011) ""Understanding Heritability: What it is and What it is Not""<p><a href=""http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Johnson_Penke_Spinath_2011_-_Heritability_rejoinder.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Johnson_Penke_Spinath_2011_-_He...</a><p>""Presuming this is correct and, as Visscher and Keller appear to have implied, applicable to most behavioural traits, this indicates that literally thousands of genes are likely involved in each trait, with no single polymorphism having substantial effect, which is the quasi-innite model to which Munafo and Flint refer.

I am familiar with the current literature on the subject, both from an online discussion group hosted by the Behavior Genetics Association and from a weekly ""journal club"" during the school year (at which I met Wendy Johson, the co-author of the publication you linked to, and of other more recent publications I am linking to in this thread). The hope of many behavior genetics researchers was finding a simple genetic model of normal allele variation in just a few genes having a large and consistent influence on IQ in the normal range.

4257855,comment,4257108,4257721,1,0,vibrunazo,,,"Those would be grammatically correct around here, I don't think I ever seen anything like that in the real world. In actual math classes people will usually just put parenthesis around numbers: (12, 3), (7, 6), (3,2). Sometimes people will actually replace the comma for the dot to avoid confusion (there's no hard rule set on stone, as long as you're being clear, it's ok). Sometimes people will just space them differently like you did and hope that's clear enough. For dictating, I don't think anyone would dictate the commas between numbers, you would just space them when speaking ""twelve comma three.... seven comma six"".<p>If you think that's confusing. It's funny to know that we often also use the dot as a multiplication sign. So ""12.3,7"" actually means ""twelve multiplied by 3.7"" in english. Btw I'm curious, does other countries also use dot for multiplication or is it only us?",1342558843

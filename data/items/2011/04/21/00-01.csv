One can also say search is a form of optimization.<p>But Based on my readings genetic algorithms are more known to be susceptible to local minima, while simulated annealing in theory is a global method.<p>---<p>As for genetic algorithms - for optimization I prefer Differential Evolution. For Exploration maybe genetic algorithms are more fruitfull although I think Genetic programming and Learning Classifier Systems be slept on. Speaking of slept on - another under appreciated but much more used method is stochastic gradient descent. Global optimums might be overrated.",1303347551

2469044,comment,2467916,2468997,3,0,ctide,,,"You're pulling things out of context.  The full quote, which answer most of your questions:<p>"" A nameless person has decided that he, not us, is best placed to release the new Amon Tobin album, and to do so for free, online via a watermarked promotional copy. We know these things happen, and we know that not everyone realises how much is invested in ambitious, groundbreaking tours, collaborations with brilliant artists and lovingly designed packaging... It still hurts.""<p>The point they're making is that it costs them a lot of money to produce an album, and someone deciding to leak it early sucks.  An obvious point, but one that's probably written more out of frustration than out of a desire to communicate something people don't already know.<p>The translation that I took from it, is that they want to offer a full package on a given date.  That package includes the option to digitally purchase the music, or buy a physical disc that includes things that they feel are important to some people.  By having it leaked a month+ early, most people are just going to acquire it they only way they currently can -- by downloading it for free.  Offering a digital download a month early is obviously not the ideal scenario for them (it means people who would have otherwise purchased a physical copy will now just purchase a digital version) but it's better than just losing all the sales that will otherwise result from people being 'finished' with the album before it's even released.",1303347503

Having this type of data unencrypted means the father going through a child custody case may find all his movements lifted by a private investigator, the local politician who frequents a red light district may be at even greater risk of blackmail, and the small-town activist may find themselves harassed in new and interesting ways by local police of dubious moral character.<p>When presented with plausible scenarios like this there are certainly people who would still shrug and say, ""I still don't care"".

(Just by way of example, if you <i>do</i> decide that the user should manage memory manually, you should at the very least provide some kind of indication about how much memory/threads/resources each app is currently using, otherwise the user is just shooting blanks in the dark (sic)). You didn't previously (need to do this) under single tasking.  For most apps therefore single tasking provided a superior user experience.<p>The obvious exception is apps that do some kind of notification, e.g. if you wanted to write your own SMS or twitter style client.  Given the vast numbers of apps coded for the single tasking paradigm, it would have been better to create some kind of 'opt-in' notification API (a good one, not whatever they had previously).<p>(3) to an experienced eye the performance degrades as it reaches those limits and starts having to do app level garbage collection.  Also, this means that apps need to pay more attention to their own memory management and the low-memory messages they are receiving from the OS.  In a perfect world this would have already happened.  Given the ... how shall I put it ... <i>journeyman</i> level of experience of most iOS developers this is an utterly unrealistic expectation.  This is a big issue.",1303345521

So it works well for short documents:<p><pre><code>  $ head -c16384 /dev/random > 16KiB\n  $ cat 16KiB | gzip | wc -c\n   16407\n  $ cat 16KiB 16KiB | gzip | wc -c\n   16628\n  $ cat 16KiB 16KiB 16KiB | gzip | wc -c\n   16790\n</code></pre>\nBut not so great for anything 32KiB or larger. Here, it doesn't even detect exact content repetition after 32KiB:<p><pre><code>  $ head -c32768 /dev/random > 32KiB\n  $ cat 32KiB | gzip | wc -c\n   32791\n  $ cat 32KiB 32KiB | gzip | wc -c\n   65564\n  $ cat 32KiB 32KiB 32KiB | gzip | wc -c\n   98337\n</code></pre>\nBZIP2 uses (by default and at most) a 900KB block size, so does better as a 'compare' on larger files, but again fails to find exact duplication separated by 900KB:<p><pre><code>  $ cat 32KiB | bzip2 | wc -c\n   33266\n  $ cat 32KiB 32KiB | bzip2 | wc -c\n   41263\n  $ cat 32KiB 32KiB 32KiB | bzip2 | wc -c\n   41396\n  $ cat 32KiB 32KiB 32KiB 32KiB | bzip2 | wc -c\n   45426\n\n  $ head -c450000 /dev/random > 450KB\n  $ cat 450KB | bzip2 | wc -c \n  452422\n  $ cat 450KB 450KB | bzip2 | wc -c \n  563107\n  $ cat 450KB 450KB 450KB | bzip2 | wc -c \n 1015533\n  $ cat 450KB 450KB 450KB 450KB | bzip2 | wc -c\n\n  $ head -c900000 /dev/random > 900kB\n  $ cat 900kB | bzip2 | wc -c\n  903828\n  $ cat 900kB 900kB | bzip2 | wc -c\n 1807770\n  $ cat 900kB 900kB 900kB | bzip2 | wc -c\n 2711478\n</code></pre>\n(I'm kind of surprised the BZIP2 results jump so much from the 1x32 to 2x32 trial, but then much less to trials 3x32 and 4x32, and that the 2x450 to 3x450 size jumps so much after the 1x to 2x didn't. Which I think just demonstrates that the specifics of the compression algorithm matter a lot, so you might want to be careful using this technique as a scalar magnitude-of-similarity measure even within the dictionary/block size.)",1303344083

Product development isn't overnight and I just think it's silly to imply that a product announcement on Tuesday that includes features similar to a product announced Monday implies theft or even borrowing when both of said products have likely been in R&D for months or longer.",1303344015

So if you&#x27;re already familiar with fourier transforms, this might be the missing piece to this article:<p>Multiplication of polynomials when expressed in the domain of &quot;array of coefficients&quot; is a convolution operation: really you&#x27;re summing (AB)_k = sum_{i=0}^k A_i B_{k-i} to find the kth coefficient of the result. The indices for B go backwards to those of A and they add up to the fixed quantity k, so we&#x27;re just looking at a discrete convolution of these two arrays.<p>And what does Fourier Transform do? It turns convolutions into point-wise multiplication in the &#x27;time&#x27; domain. The convolution started as an n^2 operation but the point-wise multiplication is n, so we&#x27;re left with the FFT time of n log n. So this is another instance of the &quot;formulate problem as a convolution, FFT, perform point-wise multiplication in the time domain, inverse FFT, done&quot; class of algorithms.<p>(I got stuck a while trying to figure out how polynomial multiplication is convolution. Literally it&#x27;s point-wise multiplication of two functions, not a convolution, so everything seemed backwards.)",1441669853

This protected the virus during the freeze drying process. After drying the ampoules were sealed under nitrogen. Like other vaccines, once reconstituted it became ineffective after 1–2 days at ambient temperatures. However, the dried vaccine was 100% effective when reconstituted after 6 months storage at 37 °C (99 °F) allowing it to be transported to, and stored in, remote tropical areas. Collier&#x27;s method was increasingly used and, with minor modifications, became the standard for vaccine production adopted by the WHO Smallpox Eradication Unit when it initiated its global Smallpox Eradication Campaign in 1967\n&quot; -- <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_vaccine</a>",1441668831

A new iPhone 5s does a pretty good job with something like that app I linked to, whereas an older Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 does not.  A lot also depends upon the browser, since there is a <i>big</i> difference between the JS engines in Chrome (best, by far) and FF/IE when it comes to things like requestAnimationFrame() execution performance.  The linked-to example is a dog when run on IE 11/Windows 8 on a practically-new Dell laptop/tablet convertible with an i3, but works nicely in Chrome on the same device.<p>Re: CSS grids - totally agree.  But, what I&#x27;ve learned over the last 4 years of developing a web application IDE is this: CSS is great if you want to set the layout and leave it alone (for the most part).  In other words, when the JS is decorative, things are great.  When the JS becomes the primary actor, things start to break down due to lack of control over how/when the reflows/repaints occur.",1441667487

2628097,comment,2627921,2627949,2,0,makecheck,,,"I agree.  Note that there are multiple things on the Mac App Store that do this already; for instance, I dug up TileWindows (never tried it, no idea if it's the best of them).<p>It would be nice if windows could be independently told to lose their chrome to make more room, as they seem to in Full Screen, but without actually taking up the whole screen in the process.  For instance, why shouldn't I be able to toss 2 or 3 terminal windows on the left half of a display while still having room for regular, non-Full-Screen windows on the right?<p>Ultimately I think Apple made a good decision by combining Full Screen and Spaces, because they are <i>very</i> similar.  Each screenful is essentially devoted to some task, whether that task requires many windows or one, and it's nice to switch between them so easily.<p>The only question that remains for me is what will happen with 2 displays.  I <i>hope</i> Apple has a simple way to place any Full Screen app and/or any Space on <i>either</i> display, where I can switch one display without affecting the other.  One of the infuriating things about Mac OS X 10.6 and earlier right now is that a full-screen app on a second display affects the first display in weird ways (e.g. a 2nd display's full-screen mode can be turned off by trying to interact with windows on the 1st display, which seems like a nonsensical restriction).",1307426729

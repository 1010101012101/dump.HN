I was so fascinated with operating system kernels and base system layouts then.<p>I've been a Linux-on-the-desktop user since 1998 or so, and started using it full-time in 2001. Having grown up on closed & proprietary operating systems with ""black box"" operation, I found it amazing how transparent everything in the UNIX world was, and how much control you had over your machine.<p>Lately, I've just been happy that my laptop hardware finally works ""out of the box"" and with minimal tweaking, so I can get on with my life and focus on the things that matter (I'm a software engineer, so get on to coding & designing software).<p>I fear that simple usability and hardware frustrations caused many people who would have been Linux/BSD users over to Mac OS X -- a proprietary & closed system that at least has BSD roots. Linux may not be the best kernel design ever, but it's a Free operating system with serious UNIX roots and astoundingly good hardware & software support.<p>In my current work as an engineer of large-scale web applications and distributed services, I find that kernels and base operating system layouts are playing decreasingly important roles. We are automating these details with tools like Puppet and Chef. We are spinning up Linux machines in virtualized providers like Rackspace Cloud and Amazon Web Service. We want to forget about these details and get on with our lives.<p>We just need something that runs on our physical or virtual hardware and runs our stack of open source databases, programming languages, and services. We need something that just works.<p>I only came across one place, recently, where operating system choice seemed to matter -- and that was in the deployment of a pair of physical network router boxes in a colocation facility. For that, we chose OpenBSD over Linux due to its out-of-box better support for high-availability networking, packet filtering, load balancing, etc. But I can't think of another time -- desktop or server -- in the last 5 years where it has made sense to choose BSD over Linux.",1344865848

The book I link to above was critical in helping me to understand the approach taken by the team I was working with. It takes a keen, detail-focused mind to do this kind of work.<p>The approach we took was to create a legacy interface layer. We did this by first wrapping the legacy code within a FFI. We built a test-suite that exercised the legacy application through this interface. Then we built an API on top of the interface and built integration tests that checked all the code paths into the legacy system. Once we had that we were able to build new features on to the system and replace each code path one by one.<p>Unsurprisingly we actually discovered bugs in the old system this way and were able to correct them. It didn't take long for the stakeholders to stop worrying and trust the team. However there was a lot of debate and argument along the way.<p>The problem isn't technical. You can simultaneously maintain and extend legacy applications and avoid all of the risks stakeholders are worried about. One could actually <i>improve</i> these systems by doing so. The real problem is political and convincing these stakeholders that you can minimize the risk is a difficult task. It was the hardest part of working on that team -- even when we were demonstrating our results!<p>The hardest part about working with legacy systems are the huge bureaucracies that sit on top of them.",1344865625

That part of the market is always less profitable on a per unit basis and more reliant on volume.<p>It is also arguably more competitive than the high end. Few Android handset manufacturers other than Samsung are making models that compare favourably with the iPhone, however down the bottom end there are loads of players (many fighting for their lives) cutting further into margins at those price points.<p>Interestingly Samsung, arguably the only Android manufacturer that does compete successfully at the top end is massively profitable itself.<p>But if Samsung and other choose to scrap it out in a low margin market, you can't really blame Apple when that strategy fails to realise the same profits and you can't really use it as any sort of justification.",1344865514

I honestly don't know how.<p>For example, a Life Insurance Administration System in a small insurance company.  First, let's make some broad assumptions to make things easier:<p>1.  The system will be ""go-forward"" only. i.e. we will not convert current policies onto the new system.
2.  The system will NOT support any current product lines, but at launch will only support new product X, which is still in the product planning stages.<p>Given those 2 assumptions, how much customization will the new system require?  The answer that everyone hopes for when they buy the software from the vendor (and the story the vendor sells) is, very little. The reality is that the system that goes live is usually very, very customized OR it ends up being very under utilized and simply interfaces WITH THE LEGACY SYSTEMS to meet the requirements of the product team, the regulatory bodies, the actuaries, etc. etc.<p>So what's a legacy system hating hacker to do?<p>The only way I could see legacy replacement being feasible is if big corp X decided that they were going to do full in house system development, and then market the core or the resulting system to their competitors.  This isn't unheard of, and has been done in the past, but is pretty rare.  The trend over the last 20+ years has been to out source virtually all of IT and buy off-the-shelf, vendor supported software to administer daily business.  The argument, that big corp X is not in the business of software development is difficult to argue against.  Alas, the end result is vendor lock-in, increasingly expensive services contract, and stagnant systems that are impossible to pry your business loose from.<p>The in-house/out-source cycle is fairly common in big financial services/health care corporations, usually on about a 4-8 year schedule.<p>I suspect the HN audience is not particularly interested in legacy systems development, or how one's insurance policy is administered.  But, the next time you notice how large your insurance premium payment is, or complain about bank fees, or drug dispensary fees, etc. etc., stop and think for a second about what that money is paying for.  In the case of insurance (which is the industry I'm familiar with), I'd argue that for a low-risk client, that a large percentage of your premium goes to administration of some sort.",1344864069

It resolves the versions to be used on each build. If you have dependencies on snapshot versions then there's no way to ensure that all developers are using the same snapshot. OK, you can always specify versions explicitly, but then you lose the benefits of snapshots etc. Bundler's lock file allows you to easily check for newer versions(a gem at a time if you like) without losing reproducible builds.<p>2) Developers can't upload their jars to the central maven repository. There are gatekeepers. This means that the latest versions of many projects aren't in the central repository. For those projects you have to use their own specific repository. This leads to problem 3. With rubygems developers can upload gems straight into rubygems.org. Also, because most projects are in github and you can specify git dependencies with Bundler you're able to depend on any version of a project(regardless of whether or not it's been released to rubygems.org), all the way down to the commit level.<p>3) 3rd party repositories change and can be unreliable.

I feel Wikipedia is not at its strongest there, since it tends to require synthesis that is almost inevitably opinionated and subjective. Most good review articles in journals are opinionated critical surveys that make novel syntheses (e.g. propose a new taxonomy), which is not really Wikipedia's role.<p>Though, having participated in some attempts in academia to come up with consensus summaries on subjects, I think the problem may be inherently hard rather than Wikipedia-specific. If you get 10 prominent AI researchers, from several traditions, in a room and ask them to write a 5-page general introduction to AI, there will almost certainly be sparks flying. You quickly run into the trouble (as in the logic article) of jockeying over what sub-areas deserve prominent mention, how to conceive of and define the subject, etc. And the results inevitably sound ""written by committee"", since the intro has to include a nod to everyone's area.<p>I've lately taken a more systemic view of Wikipedia coverage, where my goal is to improve Wikipedia's network of articles in an area rather than mainly the top-level overview article. So I care less about what goes in [[History of Greece]], and more about the thousands of articles (most of which don't yet exist) on historical Greek people, places, events, etc. I think that network-of-coverage aspect is one of Wikipedia's strengths as a hypertext encyclopedia, whereas the overview articles are a strength of more traditional linear-text encyclopedias like <i>Britannica</i>. It also feels easier to make incremental progress in that approach: I sometimes just pick up a random history book from a library shelf, and start asking what it covers that Wikipedia doesn't yet cover, then begin adding that.",1344863366

Also, when did mild animosity get associated with ""average 4chan behaviour""? 4chan is not the birthplace or the only place where people are immature on the internet.<p>So ok, you probably don't have a twitter account. Ok, you're one of those people that prefer RSS feeds for everything and you know what? There's nothing wrong with that. I mean you could use the twitter api and get the rss feed for it (<a href=""http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.rss?screen_name=shit_hn_says"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.rss?screen_n...</a> would be the one for this particular twitter account) but that's not the reason why you don't like this format.<p>Apparently the reason you have such reservations for this twitter account is because there's a ""lack of context"" or ""140 chars is too limited"". With the lack of context I agree it's a bit of a problem but It's not anything that a simple google search can't find. Plus, in many cases you don't need any context. These quotes can be self contained without knowing when and which thread they were said. These are quotes which are likely to pop up in any HN thread.<p>As for the ""limitations"" issue, I don't see the problem. What do you expect? A huge essay on why a quote is silly? As far as I can see, the format that the creator has chosen and has displayed works pretty well. I can't think of anything else that could be added to it or any problems coming from this because of ""limitations"".<p>The twitter format doesn't work for you. We see that. That doesn't mean that this is a ""poor execution"" and that it could be improved. Not everything should be the most perfect execution. Sometimes something as simple as a twitter account works and it's clear that from some of the posts in this thread, that it works fairly well.",1344863080

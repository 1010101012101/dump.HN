It's not free, but it's by far the best product I've used, with the largest plugin development community, and a great list of sibling applications you may want to try later on.  It's not open source, but you do get the source code when you buy an enterprise license.<p>Jira is also great for managing project work internally.",1207376525
155540,comment,155400,155509,0,0,maximilian,,,"I also usually don't comment because the other comments are often so biting.  I really enjoy reading about what influences people and their histories.  Opinions about subjects without clear answers can be interesting to read, but always leave one feeling slightly at odds with the writer.  Its almost that if written correctly, opinion pieces should have at least something that you don't agree with.  In good situations, this initiates a discourse around that point, but often online this just leads to trolling by commenters - which never leads to good things.",1207376513

155538,comment,155400,155400,0,0,rglovejoy,,,"I like P.G. Wodehouse's stories; I'm quite a bit less impressed with his activities during World War 2.<p>Wodehouse was in France when the Germans invaded in 1940.  He was interned as an enemy alien by the Nazis for a year.  The Germans were able to persuade him to make some light-hearted radio broadcasts intended for American (but not British) consumption, in exchange for his release from internment.  Many Britons (including A.A. Milne) never forgave him for this, though Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell defended him.<p>After the War, Wodehouse found that he could not live in England and moved to the U.S., where he became a citizen in 1955.",1207376019

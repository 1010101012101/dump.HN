They have oblique aerial photos of staggering resolution - a lot of US and European cities photographed from four angles. (They use Photosynth tech for that, and have smooth turning between different angles.) And they didn't bet on user-generated 3D city models, using professional models instead, that look better than Google's.<p>Google is leading with Street View, but it's not hard to clone.

What type of development are you doing?<p>Ubuntu is good but I would say that as far as unix like desktops go it still has a long way to go to match OS X.<p><i>edit</i><p>Just read through your posts and it looks like you're a webdev in which case except for the lame PHP build OS X comes with by default(just replace it) you shouldn't notice any difference that would make it worth switching over to Ubuntu for except if you just generally perfer Ubuntu.  It won't make your work easier though.",1208022971

If it was independant it would be weird(er), but if I saw money sitting in a fridge it would mean exactly one thing:  someone is paying someone back from taking liberties with food.  To me it's implicit.<p>So, I think the experiment was more of an experiment in mind fuckery.  Imagine, coke's show up-- sweet I'll have one (assuming I didn't have a ten commandments frig-magnet). I drink a soda, and after an hour or day they're all gone.  (Maybe I only drank one.)<p>The the next day,... oh I guess I would need to know what the timeline was on the experiment... but say I take that leap to finish (I give it under 10% that this happened in the same weak though.)  I, having only drank one soda, know someone else might've drank five.  And perhaps, they, the 'other(s)' felt guilty when no more cokes showed up.<p>Basically I wouldn't touch some one's reparations, unless I knew it was me.  And with my partial guilt, I wouldn't touch that sin money... I might throw in a buck.",1208022834

161933,comment,161886,161930,0,0,apexauk,,,"I was discussing Seedcamp the other night.. the issue is (and here's why I think YC has it spot-on) at the micro-seed-funding stage (which it is, exactly like YC) the most important thing is the idea/product/demo. Whereas YC has teams working flat-out under extreme pressure to actually <i>produce</i> something in so many weeks, Seedcamp was much more ""let's cover all the bases..marketing, finance, biz-dev.."". At the micro-seed level it should be at least 80% product/polishing the idea - this is what's most important to get to the next stage, after all!",1208022540

161930,comment,161886,161886,0,0,madmotive,,,"Excellent post.<p>I particularly hope the predication about SeedCamp comes true.  It really does need to become more like YC if it's going to have as big an impact.  Alternatively they could start again from scratch and keep it much simpler.<p>It seems to me that SeedCamp's biggest problem might be that there are so many people involved.  Committees of even the brightest people are good at making ok decisions but rarely take the risk of making brilliant decisions.",1208022059

One of the reasons (although not the only) is that since I run Ubuntu on my server, I'll be able to develop on the same platform my apps will be running on. Before anyone mentions it, I do know I can run Parallels/VMware on OS X with Ubuntu virtualized, but I'd like to see if anyone has made the switch completely and if they either regret it or love it.",1208021690

161918,comment,161269,161845,0,0,aswanson,,,"Right, that is how brand advertising works.  But given the structure of the web, you can get an estimation of how effective it is by how users respond to it (clicks).<p>Put yourself in the position of an ad exec who has $n dollars to spend on his campaign and has to present to a superior how effective it was.  If he has a web ad placement, the execs in charge of the money are going to immediately query him on what they got out of it (how much traffic they got from it).  Adsense has spoiled companies into being far more demanding on number metrics on effectiveness.  I can't think of 1 flash ad, branding or not, that does not have the option to click and learn more about the product.  They <i>are</i> measuring the ad resonance, transaction driven or not.<p>The fact of the matter is, companies want a return on their web ads they can quantify.  They measure using stuff like this:

After that point it becomes worth it, on a personal level to invest time into finding more of those gems.

8477585,comment,8477254,8477453,0,0,userbinator,,,"They&#x27;re relatively slow for a <i>single</i> instruction, but if you compare the uops they generate with the number of uops needed for an equivalent sequence of multiple simple (&quot;RISC style&quot;) instructions, I&#x27;d bet they&#x27;re the same or even slightly better - after all, an equivalent sequence of instructions would need to perform the same operations the same way - by generating uops for the execution units. The difference is that the RISC-style instructions take up more cache and fetch and decode bandwidth, whereas these CISC instructions get expanded into uops inside the decoder - so the speed of these instructions is dependent upon how fast the decoder can emit the uops.<p>...and looking at the same Haswell instruction tables for the simpler sequence of instructions, we find that:<p>AAA performs a compare and decides whether or not to add some constant, along with some flag operations; 2 uops is what one compare and one add instruction would already generate, plus you&#x27;d have to take into account a (possibly mispredicted) conditional jump. If you find out a way to do it using a CMOV, that alone is 2 uops and a latency of 2 cycles. AAS is similar except it&#x27;s doing a subtraction, but maybe there&#x27;s something else that increases its latency by another 2 clocks...<p>AAD is an 8-bit multiply followed by an addition and clearing of a register. MUL/IMUL r8 generates 1 uop and has a latency of 3, ADD r, i is another uop with a latency of 1, and clearing the register is another uop (no latency due to register renaming, I&#x27;d guess.) This would be 3 uops and a latency of 4, exactly the same as the single instruction.<p>AAM is an 8-bit divide; a DIV r8 generates 9 uops and has a latency of 22-25, compared with 8 uops and a latency of 21 for AAM.<p>So it would appear that Intel has pretty much made these instructions as fast as they could for the microarchitecture, and glancing through the tables this appears to have been true since the Pentium II (with two exceptions - the Atom series, and the ill-fated NetBurst); e.g. in the Nehalem, we have<p><pre><code>    AAA/AAS/DAA/DAS  1 uop, latency 3
    AAD 3 uops, latency 15(?)
    AAM 5 uops, latency 20
</code></pre>
and the Pentium M has<p><pre><code>    AAA/AAS/DAA/DAS 1 uop, no latency listed
    AAD 3 uops, latency 2
    AAM 4 uops, latency 15
</code></pre>
The Atom is rather disappointing:<p><pre><code>    AAA/AAS 13 uops, latency 16
    AAD 4 uops, latency 7
    AAM 10 uops, latency 24
</code></pre>
The P4 is <i>extremely</i> disappointing:<p><pre><code>    AAA/AAS 4+27 uops, latency 90
    AAD 4+10 uops, latency 22
    AAM 4+22 uops, latency 56
</code></pre>
AMD has historically been worse on the complex instructions, and although they&#x27;ve improved a bit, are still behind Intel&#x27;s latest; e.g. for Steamroller the timings are<p><pre><code>    AAA/AAS 10 uops, latency 6
    AAD 4 uops, latency 6
    AAM 10 uops, latency 15 (on par with 9 uops/latency 17-22 for DIV r8)
</code></pre>
Edit: I benchmarked AAM vs DIV and AAD vs MUL+ADD (with a dependency chain, so the real latencies are being tested instead of being hidden by something else) on a Nehalem (i7 870) and for 500000 iterations,<p><pre><code>    5250303 clock cycles for DIV
    5250258 clock cycles for AAM
    3818905 clock cycles for MUL+ADD
    3818907 clock cycles for AAD
</code></pre>
So it&#x27;s safe to say they&#x27;re really just as fast.",1413705329

8477562,comment,8475809,8476877,0,0,geocar,,,"j is abstract. It seems like it should be easier if it is concrete, but I find that this tends to lead to assumptions and encourages scanning instead of reading.<p>When I sit down to a program, I have an idea about what I want to do. I don&#x27;t have home/end keys on my keyboard and I note that pressing Fn-Left and Fn-Right is annoying because I don&#x27;t usually push them (I use emacs sometimes). So when I sit down to edit I want to add emacs keys.<p>I can see at <a href=""http://kparc.com/z.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kparc.com/z.txt</a> that hx handles home/end, and that cX is control-X, so I think it should be something like:<p><pre><code>    ca:{hx 0 -1};ce:{hx 0 1}
</code></pre>
Now I look at the characters spent: Is it possible I could say this simpler? I don&#x27;t think so, but I&#x27;d love someone to tell me.<p>How about delete? I think what I want to do is select the next character and remove it. So where is the cursor? Well I remembered that hx moves the cursor, so I read it&#x27;s definition:<p><pre><code>    hx:{L i+d*x}
</code></pre>
Okay, so I remember d is &quot;dimensions&quot; and &quot;i&quot; is something, and L I haven&#x27;t seen yet. So I go look at L:<p><pre><code>    L:{K@B/0|x&d-1}
</code></pre>
Now I have two new words: K and B to look up:<p><pre><code>    B:{c[x]&y+b x}
    K:{J(;|\(*k),)[H]x}
</code></pre>
Okay, B is straightforward: b is indexed by line, so b x returns the offset of line x. We add this to y (which is the second value of |x&d-1) and take the min of it and the offset for c. I might think at this point B converts the x/y coordinate into a linear offset. But what about K?<p>K is using J and H (but it turns out we only need J):<p><pre><code>    J:{k::2#0|x&-1+#a}
</code></pre>
And here we see the definition of k: x&-1+#a is the smallest of x and the second to last character in the file (a), and the max of that and zero (0|). This reads like &quot;bounds check x to the shape of a&quot;. Taking 2 from that simply takes two values and assigns them to k so if x is only one-value k will still have two.<p>k is the cursor selection.<p>From here, I can make an attempt at implementing delete. My first attempt looked something like:<p><pre><code>    cd{a::((0,k)_a),(((k+1),(#a)-(k+1)))_a}
</code></pre>
Oh! But I&#x27;ve seen a lot of these terms before! Maybe I can do better. I note that kx is documented as the callback for keystrokes <a href=""http://kparc.com/z.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kparc.com/z.txt</a> and can come up with:<p><pre><code>    cd:{K j+!2;kx&quot;&quot;}
</code></pre>
This seems about as simple as I can make it. I&#x27;d like to see someone do better, but <i>knowing</i> that K is a setter for the cursor selection and j is the offset of the cursor, then j+!2 simply returns offset and offset+1; K will select it and kx&quot;&quot; will remove it.<p>Now maybe if k were called cursorSelection I might have gotten my first cd faster, but I would&#x27;ve missed the opportunity to see how these functions and variables were interconnected and I might not have written the second one.<p>I noticed however, that not scrolling really helped this exercise. I just moved my eyes around, and jotted a few symbols down on my notepad. I feel like if I had to scroll or switch windows I would not have been able to do this.<p>As for your last question: What does one need to master it? For now, I would say practice. Try writing a program in as dense a manner as possible. Remove as much redundancy as you can. Read it and re-read it until you feel like it can be no more abstract.<p>I am working on a much better answer, but I hope that one will do for now.",1413704568

Nationmaster ranks France as #18 in terms of GDP per capita, at $36,500 per person, yet France works much less than most developed nations. They achieve their high standard of living while working 16% less hours than the average world citizen, and almost 25% than their Asian peers as per UBS. Plus, if you visit France you&#x27;ll also realize that their actual standard of living is probably much higher than GDP numbers would indicate.<p>Thus, if one were to divide France&#x27;s GDP per capita by actual hours worked, you&#x27;d probably find that the French are achieving some of the highest returns on work-hours invested. Labor Alpha, if you will.<p>We can actually calculate this Labor Alpha using statistics from Nation Master.<p>France has $36,500 GDP/Capita and works 1,453 hours per year. This equates to a GDP/Capita/Hour of $25.10. Americans, on the other hand, have $44,150 GDP/Capita but work 1,792 hours per year. Thus Americans only achieve $24.60 of GDP/Capita/Hour.<p>This puts the French Labor Alpha at about $0.50 GDP/Capita/Hour over the US.

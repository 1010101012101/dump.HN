Given that, I don't think it could weaken the iTunes/iOS ""death grip"" even if it were accepted.<p>But if they aren't using hardware acceleration then I suspect it wont get approved.

Reading your own code (debugging, refactoring, coming back to something you wrote on Friday on Monday), and reading other code (""why doesn't this library work?"").<p>Once you learn to read, a number of things happen.  You are no longer a slave to your libraries; you can open them up, see exactly what they're doing, and either change your mental model or change the code.  You don't have to get stressed out about ""coding guidelines"" anymore, because you actually understand what the code means.  Inane details like tabs versus spaces and cuddled elses or whatever don't matter anymore, because you have seen all the possible combinations.  And, you pick up the style of your peers, because you aren't coding in a vacuum anymore.<p>I could go on and on, but if I boil it down to one action item, it's ""when you have a problem with a library, read it"".

Every other metric we use to measure quality is subservient to one simple truth.  How does your code age?<p>How easy is your code to modify later when you need to add a new feature?  I think that's the only measure of good code that I trust.  I get a little proud of myself when I need to modify something I've written previously to add a new feature and it's relatively easy.  So I look back at how I wrote it then and try to learn from it.  The opposite is also true.  If I need to modify my code to add something and it is truly painful then I know I did something wrong way back when.  The same is true for bugs found.  If every bug found requires massive code changes than I did a pretty piss poor job initially.  But if most bug fixes only require a couple of lines than I did well.<p>This makes identifying good and bad practices especially difficult because it requires that you stick around for things to fall apart.  This is one of the reasons that commercial software sucks so much and why consultants leave giant messes in their wake.  The short-term priorities of business conflict with the long-term reality of determining software quality.<p>As a developer it's your obligation to learn from your past mistakes and better yourself.",1284042914

Is that big iron?  How does its price compare with the amount of developer salary and benefits you'll have to spend to grok a non-relational data store, migrate your data to it, and reimplement the ACID features of a relational store in the code for your app?  How many developer-days will you spend maintaining that code and how many developer-nights will you spend triaging a crashed site because of the complexity and likely bugginess of that reimplementation?  How many users' feature requests will you have to reject as ""too difficult to implement"" because you feel the need to scale to Google/Facebook levels despite having only a few million users now and predicted growth which shows you'll never in a million years catch up to them?<p>> Currently the only way to scale a relational database such as MySQL or Postgre is by sharding and partitioning<p>It will be <i>years</i> before the vast majority of startups exhaust reasonable, cost-effective options for vertical scaling.  The recent fervor for non-relational, horizontally scalable data stores is simply the new way of scratching the intellectually masturbatory premature optimization itch that programmers have had since ENIAC.<p>For what it's worth, I'm not the only crank who thinks this; Dennis Forbes has argued it much more eloquently and compellingly on his blog, e.g. <a href=""http://blog.yafla.com/Getting_Real_about_NoSQL_and_the_SQL_Performance_Lie/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.yafla.com/Getting_Real_about_NoSQL_and_the_SQL_P...</a> .",1284041875

At any one point in time, at the frontier of human knowledge, there are many research proposals floating around for what direction we should next expand the frontier.  Some of these proposals will lead to valuable gains in knowledge, and profitable technologies. Most will amount to nothing, or at most a footnote in a more important work. It becomes clear after the fact that the funding money should have been invested elsewhere.<p>So if you are a funding agency, you rank the proposals from best to worst. If you continuously added money to the agencies budget, the quality of the proposals would get lower and lower.  I believe that is what one means by diminishing returns.",1284040927

S3 is a purely network based file delivery service over HTTP, and pre-dates EC2 by a significant amount of time.<p>A Xen supervisor needs a fair amount of memory for its own operations, plus it can buffer the physical disks in the machine as well as any network attached storage. If these servers were also hosting S3 in their ""spare time"" it would degrade performance, and expose the system to potential vulnerabilities.",1284040912

An important issue is that the carriers operate on different bands so your phone is still tied to a specific carrier (if you want 3G to work).",1284040810

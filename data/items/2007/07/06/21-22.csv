32848,comment,32830,32830,0,0,mr_luc,,,"Is this a troll, or did the author not realize that urbandictionary isn't exactly a reliable resource?<p>The entry in urbandictionary for ""googe"" tries to be funny but is clearly fake.<p>I suppose it's technically possible for someone to name their startup something like ""Blumpkn"", but I'd say this is a non-issue.<p>It's a good idea to think about a word before buying it as a domain, but that's common sense.",1183757032
32847,comment,363,32766,0,0,shiro,,,"> constant when called as a function simply returns itself.<p>I thought a sequence at a procedure position acted like aref, e.g. (""abc"" 1) => #\b, right?  So the automatic promotion of constant to constant-function occurs only for non-aggregate types?\n",1183756866

I'm changing a lot of the front page layouts around - I definitely don't want that impression to be the popular one.<p>Thanks for your input, I very much appreciate it.  Check back a little later and let me know what you think.  I'm keeping the color choice though, that was the first thing I picked when I decided to make the site.",1183756286
32845,comment,32768,32768,0,0,benhoyt,,,"Nice. I reckon Markdown-style [links](<a href=""http://link.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.com/</a>) would be at least as useful, though. (I notice the paren is still included in the href -- I often would like to parenthesize links but then remind myself it doesn't work in News.YC.)<p>Just curious as to why this comments thread (32768) isn't the same as the main link (32766).",1183756207

32843,comment,32827,32842,0,0,adamhowell,,,"Your design -- original (though still same family of shades, etc.) colorscheme or not -- is just too similar. It's obvious you started with his design and built on top of it. Same width, same logo position, same search box, same zebra-striped tables, etc. And those similarities are exacerbated by the use of the illustration and the checkmark icons.",1183755707

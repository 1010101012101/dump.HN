3495066,comment,3491542,3492970,9,0,FD3SA,,,"""You're looking to tear down something without suggesting something else to take its place. In fact if you succeed what you'll have done is to shift more wealth to people who are already wealthy (by societies standards). You will have destroyed a system paying thousands of people $30,000 in favor of a startup that pays hundreds of people $150,000 a year.""<p>Tom, I'm sorry that this has just become apparent to you, but this has been the very purpose of a startup since the term was coined. Best case scenario for a startup is to spark a totally new niche and find a totally new audience, but this is rare. Most startups just end up replacing brick and mortar businesses of old and eating their paying customer base. This is economics at its finest, and most definitely leads to a poor outcome for the businesses which are cannibalized.<p>Labeling people as ""good"" and ""bad"" is a futile exercise. Capitalism is a mad scramble to extract wealth from everyone else as fast as possible, with whatever means necessary. To do this lawfully, you usually need to provide some value to paying customers. However, many businesses do it by simply convincing customers that they are receiving value, and do very well (e.g. Zynga).<p>From the tone of your article, it appears you have just understood that this system will lead to severe wealth inequality spanning orders of magnitude. This is again, a perfectly well understood outcome of the system. The societal and moral ramifications have been largely ignored due to the imbalance of power between owners of capital and those without. Thus, to have a say in the game, one must play it, and become very successful (i.e. a billionaire). In the process of becoming a billionaire, you will find that your views on this matter will change very rapidly in tandem with your net worth. Before you know it, you are advocating for less capital gains tax, more free trade and reduced government. You will see those Occupy Wall St. protesters as pathetic hooligans and low lives, who simply lack the motivation and willpower to make something of themselves. You will petition congress to protect your business interests, and pay handsomely to do so. You will support politicians who maintain order and those who crack down fiercely on all forms of business which are in direct competition to your own. If you are a film industry exec, you will lobby very hard (with SOPA and PIPA, perhaps) against new distribution channels such as Megavideo, Piratebay, etc. which give content away without due royalties. You will be apathetic to anyone who does not understand how this world works, particularly those with low or no net worth who have no say in these important decisions.<p>Welcome to the game of life. There are very few winners, and most people are losers. The only salvation for the losers is ignorance; to understand the game is to hate it. There is only one other way...play, and win.",1327189714

If I stand behind a congressman or woman because I agree with their actions and values, then one day I notice that they are supporting things that I am against, no one should be upset if I move my donations and support elsewhere. The problem comes from how he openly admits to the influence everyone already knows the media industry has over our legislative body.<p>If the media industry is as massive as they claim it to be, then every single one of those people employed in that industry has a right to support and back congressmen and women that support the values that help them strengthen their industry.

In going over what an axiom is he should have noted that Godel's work only applies to theories which have a formal axiomatic basis and that the axioms are strong enough to encode the natural numbers enough to do certain arithmetic ops e.g. statements in the theory can be proven using induction. And maybe a bit more emphasis should have been placed on the fact that it is possible for a theory to be proven complete and consistent outside itself.<p>So for example, in line with the first theorem you can algorithmically verify/decide all statements in a subset of Euclidean Geometry (the subset which does not deal well with circles).

Isn't the claim that a free market will provide a _better_ (e.g. more productive, more generally satisfying) allocation of goods than any other arrangement?  I don't see anything in the OP that suggests this.<p>Consumers may complain that this behavior results in higher prices than they would otherwise pay.  But I suspect those prices are likely only raised at the margin, to some degree that shifts consumer surplus from consumers to sellers.  They aren't being priced out of the gasoline market entirely -- were they so, total sales would fall off signalling reduced demand, and we'd expect prices to fall accordingly.  Copying here is sellers following those prices that best capture that surplus.  I'd be more worried about collective behavior that restrained market entry by other sellers.<p>Also: this discussion is focused on the short- to mid-term.  The overall price level, even if shifted among possible equilibria by collective behaviors, signals demand to producers.  A high gasoline price raises oil prices which increase incentives to find and produce more oil.  As that oil comes to market, supply increases and price falls.<p>tl;dr Free markets promise ""best"", not ""perfect"", allocation.  Not clear that these tacit cooperations do more than move prices within possible local equilibria so as to capture more consumer surplus for producers.  In any case, prices still serve, over the long term, to signal returns to investment in production.",1327187472

Not to mention, I end up relaxing more than I should and get backed up on my startup work.  Thus far I've burned thru several thousand dollars from my savings (not really regretting it, but it's not sustainable)<p>I've thought about trading trips to the Bahamas in exchange for coding with me on some projects. I suggested this to some hackers I met at a codeathon but they didn't seem to receptive (in retrospect, I can see how that may seem really shady).",1327186996

I have some news for you:<p>""Scala"" is also the name of a typeface, the student chapter of the American Library Association, part of human anatomy, a unit of area, a couple of music albums, a software company with no connection to the programming language, a couple of entertainment venues, two locations, a surname for I-don't-know how many people, and a snail.<p>> <i>it should belong to the community</i><p>A ""community"" cannot actually own a thing.

We even know that there are certain market conditions that encourage these failure modes (for example, economies of scale encourage monopolies and oligopolies). Recognizing another possible failure mode (non-collusive cartels) and the conditions that trigger it doesn't push capitalism over the line from desirable to flawed. Maybe you already believe that capitalism is flawed, but I don't think that this by itself pushes it over the line.",1327186926

We have regular hours, but if there were to be some urgent work, we would be expected to get our act together and get things done. (The only point of difference is we get paid overtime).",1327186902

They often forced people to shop in company stores and otherwise exploited them.  I don't know if that's happening in China--I have yet to read allegations of that--but it's one thing I wonder about, given the historical precedent.  With long shifts like that, it's not surprising that they want to keep workers close.  So it could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on whether and how they're taking advantage of the arrangement.",1327186901

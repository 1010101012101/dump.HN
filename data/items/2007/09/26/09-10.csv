Its for people who don't have time to blog, to write articles/essays etc and get feedback themselves.

SelfImprovement and GettingThingsDone were always hot topics in our competitive world. \nIt is like 43things.com but more focused on doing than just willing to do.\nIf you write an interface to Facebook and such then you will get a even more.\n",1190798685

Start thinking about the business case for this idea, though.  I don't mean you have to know how to make money today...I'm just wondering how big you visualize the market for this product being.

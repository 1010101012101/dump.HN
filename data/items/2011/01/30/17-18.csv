2158555,comment,2158174,2158174,0,0,JimmyL,,,"If you're curious about the regulatory history of this issue - and who isn't, really - then CRTC decisions 2010-255 (<a href=""http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2010/2010-255.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2010/2010-255.htm</a>) and (<a href=""http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-44.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-44.htm</a>) 2011-44 may be of interest to you. The former is the final in a series of decisions relating to Bell's request to allow them to move independent ISPs onto usage-based billing, and the latter is the recent decision on (effectively) an appeal of that decision.<p>If you don't care to skim the whole thing, the bottom line is that Bell is now able to force usage-based billing onto third-party ISPs, but must offer them a discount of 15% under the retail price at which Bell sells those services directly to customers.<p>Some other interesting tidbits found in there:<p>Unsurprisingly, Bell was against the idea of any discount, saying that even without a discount it would still be possible for independent ISPs to differentiate their services on price and ""other methods"". It's not clear how they'd actually do this, however. Oh, and PS there's way to determine an acceptable discount rate even if those assertions weren't true, so we shouldn't have one.<p>There's a nice note in there that ""[the] Commission also received a large number of comments, mostly from individuals, that almost unanimously opposed the Bell companies' applications [to force usage-based billing]"" - thanks for pointing that out, CRTC.<p>Bell is only required to provide third-party access to their legacy ATM networks, and not their new fiber-optic networks. This makes sense - as I've never seen the service advertised - but I hadn't seen that in writing anywhere.<p>If Bell ever does some form of promotion where they let people sign up on unlimited plans, they have to let third-party ISPs do this as well - although the mechanics are unstated (""[The] Commission finds that...to the extent that each company chooses not to charge UBB rates to any existing or new retail customer, it is required to treat GAS ISPs on an equivalent basis."").<p>Bell was about ambitious as you can get in the list of things they requested from the CRTC in these decisions. I'm not saying that I like this decision (as of March 1st I'll be paying TekSavvy more for less), but the CRTC did OK for the little guy when you see what else Bell wanted.<p>No one - not Bell, not the CRTC - says this is a technical issue. It's not that Bell can't handle all the bandwidth people use (which require a technical ITMP, in CRTC-ese), but that they see this as a way to increase profits by charging people who use more bandwidth more money (hence it's an economic ITMP).",1296409851

That said, Coffeescript: <a href=""http://coffeescript.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coffeescript.org</a>, which compiles its own language to Javascript has had a lot of success and is being used in production. So it's at least <i>possible</i> to use languages like this.<p>The extra layer of abstraction is a big hurdle. When debugging you have to find the source of the problem in the PHP, though ideally after that you can just find the matching Pharen code and go from there. One of the things on my todo list is to have at least a rough line-to-line tracker built, so that it could at least tell you the general location a problem happened, if not the exact line.<p>Translating docs and example code for existing libraries into Pharen is a bigger issue, I think. Mainly because Pharen emphasizes a functional style of coding while most PHP code assumes you are doing things imperatively. This is something Clojure has to deal with in terms of Java interop so again it shouldn't be too hard to get around.<p>In terms of efficiency there is tail recursion optimization (converts a recursive function to having a while loop at the end) and a persistent sequence library in the works that would make functional looping through a list about as fast as imperative iteration. More aggressive optimizations might come in the future.<p>If you're interested, feel free to contribute: <a href=""http://scriptor.github.com/pharen/contribute.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scriptor.github.com/pharen/contribute.html</a>.

A startup that's doing customer development instead of building something arbitrary should find those skills invaluable as long as you present them the right way.<p>EDIT: I graduated as a Geography major, with the pitch being that cartography is a very skilled form of information architecture and interaction design, as we use maps both as art and as a useful, tailored tool; geographic information systems mean I have experience working with demographics, statistics and spatial analysis; multiple anthropology courses mean I can research and present analyses on both the developing internal business structure and on our customers; philosophy means I can think critically.",1296407472

Smaller ISPs only piggy back on Bell's telephone lines only in the so-called last mile of the connection. The resellers have their own DSLAM equipment at the switchboards and they have to make their own peering arrangements to the rest of the internet. Bell's telephone lines have been (still are) heavily subsidized by the government, which is why the government is requiring Bell to share the last mile in the first place.\nThis last bit of regulation nullifies any pro-competitive effects of sharing the last mile.<p>Owning critical communications infrastructure is not Bell Canada's god given right.",1296407269

Getting broadband in a sparsely populated area is just an example of how they use their resources. Using the legal system to put the squeeze on other ISPs is another.<p>> And then some big telco coming in to try to undermine it.<p>If the big telco is the only game in town then that changes matters considerably.<p>> We've seen the same story again and again, over the globe. There is nothing unique to Canada in that.<p>I live in a rural European area right now, where I live I can choose from > 10 broadband providers with packages up to 20 Mbit/sec.<p>> As to Bell being a monopoly, that's a bit laughable of a concept now.<p>Bell still has an effective monopoly on infrastructure and that is what this article is about, charges that Bell levies on ISPs that are more or less forced to do business with Bell, we're <i>not</i> talking about a consumer monopoly, even though they still profit plenty from their former monopoly in that field.<p>> As to Canada's situation, it regularly ranks in the top tier of broadband penetration and broadband speeds.<p>The situation here is somewhat skewed because a large amount of the Canadian population lives in a very small total area of the country.<p>> It sounds like you're the one using your anecdote inappropriately, because actual metrics refute you.<p>No, it just underscores the issue. For the record, I've also lived in Toronto (King Street) and it is the contrast between the two that strikes me as placing the rural areas at a deliberate disadvantage. If anything Bell should do everything in its power to level the playing field given the monetary advantages they've been allowed to have.<p>> You're conflating issues. Because of the in-the-ground angle, companies are allowed to terminate twisted-pairs at the switching station, providing their own voice or data services. We recently hooked up a backup high-speed ADSL line, <i>the line provided by Bell</i>, with the data provided by Cogent. There is nothing changing in that.<p>Exactly. So how much choice did cogent have in using Bell infrastructure in order to reach you?<p>> What is changing is if Bogent terminated that line, but instead of providing their own infrastructure they simply leached off of Bell's. That was put in during the ""Soviet style"" control.<p>They did not 'leach of Bells', they have very little choice. Bell owns the roads, if you want your cars on them you'll have to pay toll.<p>> Again, this is all a bunch of people inventing a reality where they can have their free lunch.<p>I really disagree with you there, if they were free to lay their own fiber then that would be one thing but as long as they have no way around Bell they should not be squeezed like this.",1296407231

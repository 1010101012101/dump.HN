When the government can force you to eat cake, it hardly matters if you may have enjoyed that first piece. What matters is that you will be eating it one way or another.

Of course, but de-facto, it&#x27;s a state issue and the Feds have their own purview for things like the military and treason, etc.<p>But, if a state wanted to eliminate it, they could, so long as their legislature or judiciary so decided.  So it is a state by state issue, by and large.<p>[PS]  I think allowing things to be done state by state actually help in the end to get the whole nation to agree on things which as a whole it might not without states or a state &#x27;testing the waters&#x27; as it were.  Eventually I see all states eliminating capital punishment, and I think being able to refer to states that have and show that it has not resulted in higher murder rates post elimination is a good thing.  Same for pot laws and same sex marriage laws.  In this big republic, given that we&#x27;re not a strictly civil law, I think this bit by bit helps out, in the long run.",1373075910

If anything, it seems to me that the root cause of the issue is that AdBlock has the option for some websites to be whitelisted and allowed to show ads provided AdBlock deems them to be &quot;acceptable&quot; based on their own criteria. Even worse, this criteria includes whether or not a said website is paying them for the whitelisting privilege.<p>If AdBlock didn&#x27;t accept payments in part of considering whether a site&#x27;s ads are to be whitelisted, then Google or any website for that matter couldn&#x27;t use their monetary assets to give them themselves an apparently immoral advantage over their competitors.",1373075320

5997586,comment,5995141,5995493,1,0,cam_l,,,"The issue particular to buildings is, as opposed to manufactured goods etc, buildings tend to stick around for quite a while and cost a lot of money for the build and a lot of money to operate. More than that, large capital outlays are required to reduce the operating costs by marginal amounts over the life of the building.<p>Whenever you have a substantial delay between the outlay and the payback, market forces tend to be ineffective. Also, if we are talking energy costs, something like half the energy costs in buildings are in embodied energy - in the steel and concrete and materials used to build it. A broad scale energy tax would encourage reduction of upfront energy usage at the expense of long term operation. Any at the same time, may trigger the demolition of existing stock.<p>Add to that most - something like 60-70% - building stock in the US is between 20-70 years old. If we take the example of making more efficient cars which started in the 80&#x27;s, where the average age is less than ten years, we might expect to see the market delivering some real gains in building efficiency in 100 years or so..<p>Like it not, sometimes inefficient rigid standards are all we have. The standards are there to account for deficiencies in client requirements (or knowledge). There may be much better mechanisms to do this - one which better targets both the technical and motivational factors in energy reduction. But at the end of the day in an uninformed and long delay market, a blunt market mechanism is not it.",1373075219

Ideally, governments would see no money whatsoever that people didn&#x27;t voluntarily commit to specific ends.

In the former, the individuals affected retain the moral authority and in the latter, the government is cast as a parent figure which I find patronizing and undesirable (not to mention highly susceptible to corruption and self-interest of officials, with access to a bottomless purse). While we may need the latter in times of extreme duress (war), I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it that way unless we actually want government interference to be the norm.

The elevated temperature within the garage means more water vapor and hence latent heat within the microenvironment.<p>Finally, the quality of the good air is relative.

This sort of advertising tends not to have a strictly measured ROI in my experience since its hard to measure the &quot;value&quot; of wrapping a subway car in Jameson ads.<p>Product advertising is advertising a specific product and the ROI on it is usually closely measured when it comes to channels that can do that such as banner ads. While you are quite well informed and get information about all the new products you care about via other channels, most people are not hence the need to make people aware.<p>Without making &quot;the masses&quot; aware you end up with product usage/growth spreading virally which while it might be &quot;better&quot; is a lot harder to predict or model production levels or possible ROI on an initiative.

I&#x27;m definitely swayed by it but only when it lines up with a real desire I have. The desire comes first and the advertising shows me the way toward fulfilling it. It doesn&#x27;t both create <i>and</i> satisfy my desires. Well, not always. For example, after I saw iOS 7 I totally wanted it. Luckily I will but if I had to pay for it I might. Now, I&#x27;m wondering - did the advertising create the desire for that or did I just see something I liked and it happened to be a good match? Is there always a difference?",1373072401

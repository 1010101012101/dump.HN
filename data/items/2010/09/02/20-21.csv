If theft is defined only as the removal of a physical good from one individual to another without consent, then indeed, it's not theft in that sense.  However, if theft is defined as depriving an individual of what they are due for providing some product/service, then this is theft.<p>One way or another, somebody took the time to learn to play some instrument, write a song, record that song, then get it distributed in some manner.

If someone breaks into my car and steals my iPod, that's theft.  I, the original owner, no longer possess the item.<p>If instead the ""thief"" breaks into my car and copies all of the music from my iPod (let's say that all of the songs are recordings of my band to make things simple) and posts it on several torrent trackers, that's piracy (copyright infringement).  I still have the originals, so no harm, no foul.  In fact, I might be glad that someone is doing some free marketing for my band (or I might choose to cry about the billions in lost sales).<p>I'd argue that piracy has done more to help the music industry than it has to hurt it.  Back when people bought music on $17 CD's, they only bought a handful per year.  And once you lost a CD or it got scratched, you stopped listening to it.  You could also only carry 6 at a time in your CD changer.  With illegal MP3 downloads (and later, legal ones), people could suddenly carry thousands of songs in their pockets, and they never get lost or scratched.<p>Back in college, since music was now ""free"", my friends and I expanded our musical tastes beyond gangsta rap to include rock, country, trance, techno, classical, and jazz.  With a new world of music open to us, we started going to local jazz clubs, raves, and concerts (which put more money in the record labels' pockets than CD sales ever did).  I went to 2 Rage Against the Machine concerts in one weekend, even though I've never paid for one of their albums.<p>Just the other day I listened to the first MP3 I ever downloaded (August, 1998, Eagle-Eye Cherry - Save Tonight).  I backed up all of my old MP3's on CD-R back in the day, and they've been passed from desktop to laptop to XBox to iPod to phone ever since.<p>Since all of these songs are always instantly available to me, these artists are still within reach, even the one-hit-wonders from yesteryear.  If I hadn't downloaded Fastball's ""Outta My Head"" back in 1998, I would never have gone to see them perform at the Viper Room in 2008 (it was the illegal download of a B-side that made me appreciate them more than hearing ""The Way"" on the radio).",1283459982

You can't stay there, there is no obscure art, no atmosphere, no nothing.  You drive up, get your coffee, and leave.  You probably even finish your coffee in the car before anybody has chance to see the familiar logo that means ""cool kid"".<p>So why do people still go there and pay the $3 membership fee to a club that doesn't exist?<p>Because they've been tricked into thinking that they're buying coffee.",1283458218

What's his point?<p>What this article is really about is distaste over a policy decision Twitter appears to have made, which is that they may revoke consumer secrets for applications that end up associated with scam apps. We can argue over the merits of that decision <i>ad nauseam</i>, but I'll short circuit it (again) by pointing out that Twitter would have had the exact same problem without OAuth; they'd simply be attacking it in an ad hoc way instead of with OAuth.<p>I have two huge problems with this article:<p>* It sensationalizes an issue that isn't about security, but rather is about developer-friendliness. Of course, since (as far as I can tell) no major Twitter app has been disrupted by this unfriendliness, this story wouldn't have had legs without the scary security spin they gave it.<p>* It throws the baby out with the bathwater on OAuth, which again simply isn't intended to be a universal authentication protocol for native apps. Near as I can tell, everything Twitter's doing makes perfect sense for web apps, which I'm guessing are still far and away (by usage) the most-used customers of Twitter's API.",1283457848

My other experience is anecdotal - I've known a fair number of swedes, and they've all been satisfied with their healthcare, while people in the US have serious issues with being underinsured and having legitimate claims denied on technicalities.<p>Finally, there's the simple fact that the system in the US obviously encourages high prices.  In the insurance-based model, there's little disincentive to performing as much work, necessary or not, as possible.",1283457822

A couple years later, you decide you need more fast storage, so you add on a 512GB / 4 TB thunderbolt fusion drive box (note: this product doesn&#x27;t exist today). Next year, you upgrade the USB raid array to thunderbolt and decide you want an external cinema quality 4k / THX video converter, that also connects over thunderbolt.<p>Then in 2016, you conclude that the 24 core macbook pro is sufficient for your day to day, and hook up your bulk storage to that when you&#x27;re home, but leave the cinema converter and the old usb raid array hooked up as your htpc.<p>Incidentally, to address your specific scenario, I&#x27;m pretty sure that an Apple TV costs less than your gt120 did.<p>In other words, you doubled down on the tail end of one way of doing things, and little of that will carry over to the new standards.

Snowden did not make a mistake going to Hong Kong, he was exceptionally clever because most likely he knows more about NSA spying than just the domestic spying that he revealed. He probably knows details of international spying and how the U.S. manages to snoop on countries through technological means. By sitting in Hong Kong he is signaling that he could easily defect to the Chinese and reveal real damage to National Security or perhaps the U.S. will cut a deal with him to let him go home without much jail time. Also, at a time when the U.S. has been admonishing the Chinese for spying, this would be a propaganda gold mine for the Chinese as well as an intelligence windfall if he were to defect to their country. The U.S. would be seething if this were to happen but the Chinese know that the Americans are so tied up with business deals with China that they would not or could not do much to damage relations between the two countries.

This is the first useful article I&#x27;ve seen about PRISM, with the _possible_ exception of the scoop itself, but not excluding the existing analysis from the Guardian and WaPo.<p>For $20M, you can&#x27;t do what Prism claims to do for $20M.  Even suppose you limited your scope only to Google, AND now you limit only to GMail, AND your development and installation costs are free, and all you&#x27;re spending on is bandwidth and servers and cooling and maintenance staff, I still doubt you can read all of GMail for $20M/year.<p>Then there&#x27;s the bit where they claim that analysts, what&#x27;s the phrasing, &quot;quite literally can watch your ideas form as you type&quot;.  Seriously, think for a second what it would mean to be able to do that.  Think of how that would work, in terms of network protocols.  Now go install wireshark and open a gmail window and start composing an email, or writing half of a chat (without hitting Enter).  I haven&#x27;t done the experiment; maybe you can be the first and break a scoop!<p>Obviously the people who reported on PRISM have told some lies about what it does.  Either it can&#x27;t do what they say it does, or it cost a lot more than $20M, or both.<p>(I don&#x27;t want to minimize the seriousness of the accusations... they should be given due appraisal.  But they basically cannot be literally true as written.)<p>And look.  Google gets about 100 &quot;requests&quot; (legal demands) from government per working day, and responds (under legal duress) about 30 per working day in the US alone.  You think maybe some kind of workflow management software might be appropriate here, or you&#x27;re imagining this all goes back and forth over email?  Or maybe you&#x27;re imagining an anonymous FTP server somewhere?  Obviously the right thing to do is build a secure custom ticket-tracking system, to manage demands, push-back, authorization, fulfillment, etc.  If we want to believe it&#x27;s all okay, here&#x27;s a plausible story.

May finish one day, may not.  Would have to start it over at this point.<p>REAMDE - Neal Stephenson - set this aside a while back, but intend to finish it eventually.

The only functional difference with running them in the west is there&#x27;s a generally unenforced request to register with the government so they know who to call if they have any issues (very civilized!). As for ISP... get out of the 90s! The state took China from zero internet to most of the global internet in ~10 years - of course they own the infrastructure. As for the list of incomes .. those look out of date but I have personally spent much time in rural Yunnan and some in rural Guizhou and Sichuan and can tell you the people are generally fine and have great quality of life with loads of interesting festivals, scads of TV channels, cheap education and such. The biggest issues tend to be if people need rare medical treatments or try to migrate to the cities with minimal education... the first often ends in death, the second in a return to the country with whatever cash they can stash. Sort of like those young Amish that leave their communities to experience the world for a bit then tend to go back home.<p>Remember, these are people who are not traditionally part of the market economy in any significantly state-backed-currency-involved sense.

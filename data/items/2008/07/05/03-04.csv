236729,comment,236158,236158,0,0,kp212,,,"Have you seen consultants from overseas in an internal IT dept?  I think this is total ____, and it sounds like another PR ploy to lobby a raise for the visa quota. I work for one of the investment banks, and I would say a low ball estimate is 25%-30% of the back office IT, is visa related individuals in the US (either consultants or internal hires), not to mention the ""24 hour"" teams they like to implement with India.  I don't have a problem with companies needing to import talent at all, but I do have a problem with companies driving the wages down by using these excuses of a lack of talent. Subsequently, paying these people below US market value. If a shortage was the case, companies should pay a premium of something in the ballpark of 10% more, because of the ""lack"" of demand. Instead, they look at this as a cost saving tool. It's so blatant, and its so obvious, just work in the back office of Wall St. for a month, and you will agree.  I wonder what it's like on the west coast.",1215228586

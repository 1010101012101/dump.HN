396718,comment,396218,396601,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Yes, there's always ordinary preemptive multi threading.  My idea is more of a ""proof by example.""  Even if somehow conventional tools are not enough, there are still ways that Apple can guarantee totally paranoid control, but still give developers background processes.<p>Also, my scheme is precisely about user applications <i>not</i> getting all the CPU they need.  They'll be absolutely guaranteed to only get the miserly little bit we give them.  This will come in the form of a single user background process that runs in totally predictable time slices and -- from the POV of the OS -- never throws an exception.  (User background code will throw an exception, but it would be virtual.)  Thus, we are guaranteed to <i>never</i> get exception handling overhead from the background apps.  Likewise, we are saving context switching overhead by using ""green processes"".  One would be able to achieve a completely paranoid level of sandboxing this way.<p>The purpose of my post is not to do engineering for Apple.  It's to show there's no reason for Apple to not give us background processes!",1229179979
396717,comment,396596,396630,0,0,doodyhead,,,"To address entrepreneurship in Europe misses the point. What Mike Arrington fails to realize is he's only talking about France. When it comes to work ethic, different European countries are world's apart. You can't take countries like France, Germany, the UK and Ireland and blithely treat them as one entity. Behaviors and attitudes to work and to start-ups differ vastly from one country to another.",1229179879

It is a very smooth serial semantic for parallel programming, and really fits the beautiful criteria.<p>Unfortunately, I've recently read that STM is turning out to have too much overhead in practical applications.  Hope they figure it out.",1229179126
396710,comment,396080,396080,0,0,jeffesp,,,"I find the introduction of a hybrid polling/interrupt driven network interface really interesting.  Mainly because we did the same work in 2003 on NetBSD for a wireless router that never made it to market.  We were at the opposite end of the spectrum.  Basically, we were running on a 100 MHz 486 and spent too much time on interrupts with all the network traffic.  It's funny that it is the same situation for them on the latest systems out there (of course for some of the same, but some different reasons as well).",1229178932
396709,comment,396052,396465,0,0,yters,,,"Well, that's just a matter of psychology then, not any kind of logical should.  I think about death too, but it doesn't seem to bother me like it does others since I don't see a logical reason behind the dread.  Sure, the psychological side still gets to me when I stare death in the face, but otherwise not so much.<p>A logical should would be something like if I were to die I would spend an eternity in ceaseless boredom.  That would be a reason to avoid death.  Otherwise it is just a false anticipation, like jumping off a high rock when you know it is perfectly safe.  I try to eliminate that from my life if I can, which is the rational course of action.  I think this is the psychological basis of thrill seeking.<p>If you look at your own decision making process, you'll see that this procedure is how you also shape your psychological reactions.  Say you really dreaded a certain event, such as moving out of your parents house.  Then, when the time came, you found you could handle yourself alright.  With that knowledge in the back of your mind, you no longer dread similar situations as much.  I'm just making this process explicit in how I think about life.",1229178703

If a resurrected body does not contain my consciousness, as my thought experiment shows, then cryonics is pointless since it does not keep me conscious of being alive.  If you still think it maps to the ship problem, see if you can exactly demonstrate the mapping.<p>It's weird that people don't seem capable of distinguishing between their own consciousness and someone else's consciousness.<p>The practical grounds point is made by others.",1229178401

But they usually dont do it on HN, so it is probably a case of confirmation bias if you think programmers make more noise or talk and think more about their profession than people in other walks of life.",1229177474
396699,comment,394609,395237,0,0,bkovitz,,,"Funny thing: the word ""school"" is actually the ancient Greek word for leisure.  The idea was, if you had the means to live a life of leisure, then of course you'd spend it learning and talking about cool stuff with other similarly well-off people.<p>Somewhere along the way, they turned school into just another form of work.  Unlike regular work, it doesn't produce anything.  It has all the stress and unpleasantness of regular work (more, even), except you can't use the most efficient method to get it done (that would be delegating the work to someone who likes it), and it consumes time and other resources without yielding benefits.  The theory is that learning happens as a side-effect, but the reality is, it doesn't.  Seriously, if you wanted to set up a business to help people learn subjects to a high level of mastery, you wouldn't do it anything like a (modern) college.<p>I wonder, though, if professors live (or at least can live) the kind of life we want: they are basically paid to indulge their curiosity, and their only measurable obligation is that they have to teach some classes.  If you're a cool professor, you might even find a way to make the classes worthwhile.<p>This is the route I've just started on.  I'm now in my first semester of grad school.  I'm hoping to treat the experience as ""school"" in the ancient sense of the word.  In six or seven years, I plan to get a tenure-track job, indulging my curiosity.  I figure since that's play-time for me, I should be great at it and enjoy it.<p>Results so far: terrible.  Taking three grad-level classes at once (and teaching one class) chewed up so much time, I had almost no time to think or learn or sleep.  Complicating factor: I had a headache that lasted six weeks, and I <i>started</i> the semester exhausted.  Mid-semester, I was so exhausted, I took a three-week break from homework.  I got my ability to think back, but I spent the rest of the semester hustling to catch up.<p>Plan for next semester: Get a lot of rest over the break, and put all the creativity I can into finishing each day's ""work"" by 5:30 p.m. so I can follow my whims in the evening.<p>If that doesn't work, then I'll quit.  Or maybe not.  I just can't see getting a regular software job again.  I've done that cycle of working hard and enjoying it the first several months or a year, and then getting sick of it and barely showing up.  I think I am completely burnt out on just getting coding done.  I am particularly sick of debugging.  Oh, damn, that reminds me, I have to debug some Scheme code for one of those classes.",1229177351

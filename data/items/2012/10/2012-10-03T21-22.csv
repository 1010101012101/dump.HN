Even then they were skeptical.<p>Wikipedia actually has a reasonable history of what happened here in the US (or at least, it is similar to what i learned in law school).<p>You aren't actually contracting away any constitutional rights here, which is one reason why they allow it (though you can actually contract away constitutional rights in some cases)<p>Even the binding arbitration part is allowed, as per the Federal Arbitration Act (which has been upheld several times).<p>You can appeal the arbitration, just not on most substantive grounds (which sucks, but c'est la vie).",1349301537

It's pretty strange to leave out the case that <i>cost you your house</i>.  His failure to disclose a relevant case when questioned by the judge is inexplicable.<p>He also claimed during voire dire that he would set aside his understanding of the law from any past cases.  Then he gave media interviews in which he talked about using his past, incorrect knowledge, told interviewers about doing things that were contrary to the court's instructions, and explained how he turned around the jury's verdict.<p>Oh, and he also claimed that the court only asked him about 10 years back to one interviewer:  a claim that has proven to be inaccurate both due to that not having been said and due to another juror remembering a case older than that.",1349301475

4609834,comment,4609062,4609399,3,0,rywang,,,"It's indeed similar, but we think there are three important differences.<p>Because our cameras are top mounted, our system is more comfortable / ergonomic.  You don't have to lift your hands very high to interact, and your arms are always supported comfortably by the desk.  We can enable convenient interactions right above the keyboard or even turn the desk itself into a touchscreen.  Basically, our system is designed to be comfortable enough to use all day.<p>The second difference is more speculative, because it's hard to tell exactly what the Leap can or cannot do based off their video.  Our system captures the entire hand rather than just the finger tips.  This lets you use more natural gestures.  For example, you can spin a virtual object by rotating your hand as if you were holding it (like in the sword-waving example in our video).<p>Finally, we're starting with commodity hardware you can get at immediately.  It may look a little clunky right now, but we're experimenting with different cameras and different frames right now.  Further down the road, it'll be a monitor / laptop clip-on or even built-in.  Today, we're just releasing an SDK to let developers get started.<p>Thanks for the feedback!  All of us at 3Gear spend more time than we should reading HN.",1349301389

4609821,comment,4607747,4609714,3,0,dpritchett,,,"Commodity programmers have externally limited individual leverage (aforementioned 'teams building pyramids' strategy [1]) and systematically limited measurement (because their measurable output is blended with that of the supporting organization).  On top of all that, any commoditized worker is going to have extremely limited leverage in salary negotiations due to the ease of replacing them.<p>pg's ""How to Make Wealth"" [2] does a great job of explaining the interplay between leverage, measurement, and wealth:<p><i>To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.<p>Measurement alone is not enough. An example of a job with measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a sweatshop. Your performance is measured and you get paid accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions. The only decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that can probably only increase your earnings by a factor of two or three.<p>An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie. Your performance can be measured in the gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense that your performance can make or break it.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node1.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a>",1349301058

The real problem with the model from my perspective is that in artists (and their label/mgmts) desperation to remain relevant & earn a better living they are constantly on social media & watering down their celebrity. Combine that with the fact that any cute kid on YouTube can suddenly become a celebrity in his own right you have a) way more celebrities and b) way over exposed celebrities. The internet has basically commoditized being famous in some ways and in most artists desperation to try and get 'bigger' and make more money they make it worse. There will always be the massive artists where the masses go insane and people line up down the block to video chat with. Those artists don't have a problem now. The ones that are really in trouble are the every day middle of the road full time working artists (selling 50-300K records). This kind of platform will not work with enough scale & consistently enough to even begin a conversation about it replacing old record sales revenue.

Obviously, you'd never show a 100,000-word article on one page (except for printing). At some point, pagination is necessary. Where to draw the line is obviously depends on a multitude of factors.<p>Put permalinks next to sections headings and/or change the fragment in the url bar with javascript as the user scrolls. Links work, and no need for pagination<p>>2) Feeling like you're ""in"" the site, not in no-man's land. From a web design perspective, you always want people to be able to navigate easily to other parts of the site -- you want stuff in the sidebar, never be too far away from header/footer, etc. You don't want people to be in a narrow column of text, with total white on both sides and nothing else. (Obviously users might often prefer this, like I do, hence Instapaper etc., but other users also like to be able to skip around to the rest of the site easily once they decide this particular article isn't for them, etc.) Of course, ""floating"" sidebars, headers, etc. can help alleviate this, but this requires the sidebars to be very small, which is not always possible.<p>Use position: fixed (as you mention).Having submenus that expand on click alleviates the space constraints. You can also swap out content in your header or sidebar as the user scrolls (but please use tranitions, or you'll give everyone eyestrain).<p>> 3) ""Chunking"" large pieces of content is just a good thing. A huge wall of text is just no good from a usability or legibility standpoint. This, of course, is why articles are broken down into sentences, paragraphs, sections, parts, etc., so people ""know where they are"". Now I'll be the first to admit that paging is a particularly inelegant sledgehammer way of chunking, but when you're dealing with lots of articles of different lengths, formats, etc., it's a kind of lowest-common-denominator that is seen as better than nothing<p>What's wrong with section headings?",1349299323

A lot of the things that are either facially true or commonly held beliefs: software has low capital costs, good programmers are much more productive than bad ones, a lot of revenue can be brought in with a relatively small team, are the things that make banking, law, consulting, and even accounting more relatively lucrative for workers as opposed to shareholders.

So the 'mono' part of the signal (the vocal) ends up being different between the tracks since data loss is applied across the whole frequency range (or large chunks).

But if you which to start a company and as such have a situation were you have to apply for citizenship, then you could have a top 25 existing company in-play already employing American's and pay lots of TAX then you can still be told sorry no.  That said there was mention of a % drop in immigrant started companies and this still points to them happening.
I suspect the tighter limits has meant raising the bar beyond what it needs to be for many and with that perhaps a new type of VISA needs to be made.  I don't know the whole American VISA system that well, but certainly some middle ground from worker VISA to citizen VISA to cater for those employing American's can be met.  Maybe if they employ so many then they qualify.  So for example if you can form a company and employ say 5 people full time then you are granted say a 5 year business VISA which is reviewed every 5 years to see that you meet checks and after say 3 period gain a full citizenship.  Something like that, though a lot more detailed against loopholes I suspect.<p>But still, very nice read and very good article, despite the interesting choice of title, albeit once you have read the article you will see why it is just on so many levels sadly.",1349298886

Not so.<p>Residential housing can be somewhat modeled by the purchasers/debtors as a put option that the debtor's income will not fall below a certain floor (sufficient to service the note), with a 7 to 10-year expiration date (the average age of a mortgage in the US before it is extinguished). If the residential housing is purchased outright, then it is a put option on the area's prevailing wages, which in turn supports the valuation.<p>The housing structure and property itself is much more wage-linked asset than wealth that intrinsically generates income. It is wealth only in a derivative sense, as a high-latency indicator of prevailing wages in the area when it changes ownership.<p>To cheerlead for housing prices to go up as an unalloyed good is to misplace the context of why it goes up in the first place. For a certain phase of economic development, it can be good because of the cascading economic benefits that arise from the growth such pricing deltas signal. For America, at its current stage of economic, technological and demographic development, in its place in the world economy, it is at least highly debatable whether housing prices going up actually leads to much positive externality economic benefits as before.",1349298730

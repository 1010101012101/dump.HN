But in addition to the privacy-infringing implications of Facebook's premature program, they failed to realize that a purchase does not equal praise. Sometimes we buy things because we have to, or for other people. Sometimes we buy things everyone else is buying and spend months thinking 'what a waste of money that was'.""<p>[...]<p>""Benefits of Social Network Reviews<p>[...]Your friends get reliable data on recommendations for and against from a context that's meaningful to them. If enough of their network has reviewed a product/service, they might even have the option of segregating those reviews into more narrow contexts (coworkers at business A, friends from school G, contacts in area L).<p>You can establish yourself as an authority. Drink a lot of wine? The SNS should offer you the option of displaying your wine reviews prominently on your profile. An SNS tracking review trends across networks can recognize: ""These two people have the most dissimilar views on wine that are still agreed with by the most people in region Q. Let's display their reviews as a kind of point/counter-point to everyone in that region"".

But to call it a dongle is a bit of a stretch in my opinion.<p>Of course, the entirety of this comment is pretty much divergent from the author's main point. So, feel free to disregard the above.<p>As for Freedom Zero, there are few places you'll be able to achieve that comfortably.

105890,comment,105387,105413,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I agree with most of what you're saying, but would like to point a few things out:<p>1)  Yes, you can track ROIs of that nature, and many people do.  But as Steven Levitt says, it seems to not be a part of corporate culture to do so. And according to him, they often do waste millions.  It's not the marketer's money, after all.  They'll often say things like, ""It's my job to spend the budget"" when Levitt points out their losses.<p>2)  There's more to online ads than clickthrough, I agree.  I didn't say there wasn't.  My point was that the stats are 
easier to come by, and they'll be harder to weasel up.<p>3)  That is a legitimate concern, I agree.  However, being in a marketing arms race should already have been factored into the ROI, IRR, or whatever all-inclusive metric or set of metrics you are basing the budget decisions on.  I don't mean Pepsi should give up, or that its marketing budget is bloated, but that even in an arms-race you can go too far.",1201568891

I'm curious to know what the Hacker News collective intelligence thinks of it.<p>I recently picked up a cheap subscription to see if there was anything to learn. Topics vary month-to-month, but there are usually case studies on successful entrepreneurs, tactical articles on subjects like marketing or management, and general interest essays.<p>I wonder, though, whether I ought to ignore everything inside and spend that monthly hour elsewhere. There are ads for shady companies. They have annoying 'special advertising features' that pose as articles. The back pages swell with MLM-type scams. It seems like the sort of advertising that would target dreamers and fools instead of busy entrepreneurs looking for tips during downtime. This leads me to question the reputability of the editors and thus any advice inside. Hence this post.<p>What do you think?<p>And if not Inc. etc., where's the high signal-to-noise entrepreneurial reading?",1201568507

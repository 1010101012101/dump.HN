IMO,the point he was trying to make with the Erik the Red stuff is that climate change tends top open doors as much as it closes them.  The megafauna that went extinct made room for other species.  Warming can be disastrous for some latitudes and a boon for others.

One point up for using it's actual name, instead of that dirty word, ""carbon"" that has caught on so strongly lately.<p>Why ""intellectually dishonest""?  What does that even mean?  If somebody argues a point that you don't agree with, it's ""intellectually dishonest""?<p>You've already defined the game so much to your benefit, and we're playing it to your rules.  When you ignore water vapor, we let you.  When you ignore what everybody knows, that the climate is warming regardless of human contribution, in the endless climate cycle that's 4 billion years old, we let you.  You've defined the game to be, humans are causing extra global warming (you leave out the 'extra') and we let you.  We've handicapped ourselves quite severely in this 'debate', so that you'll at least play with us.  That you take advantage of this handicapping with not even a ""thank you"" is what is intellectually dishonest.<p>So, this author makes the claim that there may be benefits to warmer climate.  He's playing your game.  He's bowing to your religion, by saying the words ""warmer climate"".  But you're not happy.  It's intellectually dishonest.<p>Every action has costs and benefits.  Obviously there would be benefits from a warmer climate.  It's intellectually dishonest for you to claim otherwise.  Do they outweigh the costs?  I honestly don't know.  We're a global community, right?  A longer growing season in the temperate latitudes vs a shorter growing season in the tropical.  Does this result in more food or less?  I don't know (although I suspect it does).  More people running their AC in the south vs less people running their heaters in the north.  Is this a power savings or a power sink?  (I suspect this ones goes to you, as heating is more efficient than cooling).  There's a ton of analysis that could be done here, before you know the answer to this question.  For you to just say ""intellectually dishonest"" without considering any of it is perhaps a result of your bias.",1240681938

Without a centralized command and control, there is no one with a global viewpoint to do the fact-checking and correlation that could reveal this.<p>Also, open source development depends on open and efficient communications.  The adversaries can download your releases and and browse your code repository.  It's an outside legal framework that protects OS from being co-opted by proprietary actors.  Also, very often with Open Source, it <i>doesn't matter</i> if the adversary knows everything you do.  Their culture and their legacy code base prevent them from exploiting any advantage the information could give them.  In the case of terrorism, these are not barriers.  While mainstream culture of the enemy might object, the enemy intelligence services will have no compunctions.  There is also no ""operating system"" for intelligence information.<p>Lastly, Divide and Conquer has always been one of the best strategies of the imperialists.  Distributed cells come pre-divided!  Witness the internecine fighting of the various offshoots of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.  (Who are the intellectual forebears of Al Quaeda.)<p>The one thing you don't want to do: be the ""Big Bad Enemy"" that everyone must unite to oppose.  At least, don't do it too soon.  Wear them down by playing one side against the other and take them down piecemeal, until they realize they must unite to win.

But due to the nature of the field things are very closed and no one has released their data publicly or released code to parse these .rtf files or a repository for the data. The reason is that each company sees the X amount of hours they put into parsing these files into database data as a barrier to entry for competitors.<p>What other types of specific programming problems due programmers keep solving over and over again, and how do you break the vicious cycle and be the first person to release data or a solution?

The amortized cost is almost impossible to calculate -- I SEO well because I spent years learning the technical/marketing aspects and, e.g., blogging (which has a side effect of getting me domain trust), writing useful resources for my niche, coming up with a content creation strategy, etc.  (The great thing about content creation is that if you're making evergreen content you pay for it once and then it keeps getting you customers/links/etc for forever.)<p>AdWords, on the other hand, is pretty easy to calculate marginal CPAs for.  My previous experience with Google leads me to believe they understate my conversions with them, but just reading the number off the AdWords report, I spend about $12.25 per customer.  Since I make about $29 from each customer after all costs but advertising, I'm quite willing to do this all day long.<p>For those of you who are more interested in cost per signup rather than cost per paying customer: 22~24 cents.",1240679586

Dropbox could definitely have my business there and be price competitive if they offered say 250 gigs for under $100 a year. Backing up my photos should be a good profit for them over time, because once I get past the initial backup, I really only upload a gig or two a month and rarely download. Unlike my other documents, I don't need my photo backup replicated between my different computers running Dropbox.<p>Sharing photos with friends and family is something that Dropbox could be good at or at least acceptable.

What makes this really cool is that there are actually quite a few degrees of freedom in a robot arm, but they're basically using the same hardware. So the influence of <i>software/algorithms</i> in this case is pretty fundamental. There are a lot of papers on improved neural-decoding methods that at first glance appear really dry, boring, not the `sexy' kind of science with huge breakthroughs, but they end up being crucial to good performance as the complexity of the robot grows.<p>2) One participant was implanted with the electrode array 5 years before the study, and had the injury 10 years before that. Usually the signals don't last that long in monkey models. And we know that your cortex changes with disuse, so it's awesome that they were able to get usable signals so many years later.<p>What needs to get better are a couple things:<p>First, these decoders aren't perfect yet. What the Wired article didn't tell you is that the performance for the woman's implant was around 20-50% successful trials (still awesome from a comparison to no interaction)[1].<p>Second, incorporating sensory feedback is another challenge that is really hard to address, but also very important. Imagine building a robotic controller in which the only information you received about the robot's position was visual. That's the way this works. If we find a reasonable way to mimic sensors of muscle extension (a proxy for joint angle) then we can create more controllable devices.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/mind-controlled-robot-arms-show-promise-1.10652"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/mind-controlled-robot-arms-show-p...</a>",1337230274

I ran the numbers for this a while back, and the supplementary extra-budget DoD spending in the Bush years raised the DoD expenses from 22% to nearly 40% in some cases.<p>Military expenditures are much higher than 22%, even in 2011. These budget numbers hide much military spending in other budgetary components -- for example, veteran's benefits or military scholarships will fit into another category (Medicare, everything else, etc). Statistics that put military spending at a quarter of our budget never include these costs.<p>A big part of this ""change"" comes from a budgeting game which hides military costs in other budgets.

3985485,comment,3985262,3985341,5,0,fruchtose,,,"I think the natural path for Pinterest will be to merge with Groupon, another shopping-related site and one that has survived an IPO--at least for now. This new site will combine the deals of Groupon with the design of Pinterest. Users will coupons, which are automatically pinned to the appropriate boards with automatically chosen photos.<p>Of course, Pinterest is all about design, which is why Groupon will also have to acquire Instragram. This will allow the merged company to select the right photo for any coupon and, if necessary, saturate the yellows, unfocus the background, and add a creatively misaligned border. That night your friends enjoyed the half-price alcohol they bought at Jerry's Drive-In Liquor will look extra cool when the photo has been processed through the ""1977"" filter. And on the plus side, Groupon/Pinterest/Instagram gets to keep it for their next liquor-oriented deal, giving them free advertising material. It's too early to tell what this new supergroup of startups will be called, but I want some credit if it becomes Groupstagram.<p>I'm only half-kidding, of course.",1337230170
3985484,comment,3985192,3985192,6,0,tokenadult,,,"As a parent of four children (but living in a different state), I had to think for a minute about what the real problem is here. If I knew that a particular teacher was teaching well in advance of the meager United States curriculum, perhaps even coming close to east Asian standards, I would (as a parent) take that into account when looking at teacher ratings based on a slower curriculum pace. My question might be, ""How do I sign up?"" rather than ""What is the matter with this teacher?"" (By the way, the school's answer about how to sign up is found on its website:<p><a href=""http://www.ps334school.org/admissions/anderson-school-7th-grade-admissions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ps334school.org/admissions/anderson-school-7th-gr...</a><p>The school accepts new applicants for sixth grade or seventh grade, but not for eighth grade.)<p>But, really, the problem with the system is not mostly about how teachers are rated, but how little power most parents have to shop. If a teacher is doing a good job for a particular learner, most parents will be glad to seek that teacher's instruction. And if the parents are shopping, the hard-to-measure things in the aggregate that are crucially important at the individual level, for example whether or not a teacher encourages a child to do his or her personal best, will be given proper weight among all the trade-offs involved in choosing one teacher over another. But right now the great majority of pupils, in New York City and elsewhere, are mostly assigned to teachers without parental power to shop, and teacher advancement in the profession is based mostly on seniority and degrees attained<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/us/19gates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/us/19gates.html</a><p>rather than on the basis of the teachers meeting learner needs better than other teachers. The best way to promote system reform is to let the parents have more power to shop. They will ask for the information they need and weigh it in appropriate ways.",1337230168

But I know the more people will pin unique, cool photos they stumbled upon, the more artists, photographers and content owners will demand either their share, or take down.<p>In this another debate of ""is this a bubble"", something interesting came to my mind. I thing the issue here is that any online real estate that made it big, made it huge because they used the latest technology available. Think YouTube. When it started, barely anyone knew how to program flash and have a container to upload 5MB file and it could be coded in different movie codecs and youtube would read it anyways. This was definitely pushing the envelope! The technology was new, but it let you display videos and thats what counted. I think with the new technology coming in, like HTML5, etc, there will be new websites coming out and grabbing huge audience based on this new technology. So in other words, whomever is betting $1,500 millions on Pinterest, is like betting that nothing new will be invented over the web.

Jason Bigler of Google was snarking about this earlier today. [1] I realize this is largely because all the snarks come out of the woodwork before an IPO, but to a certain degree - they're right. Facebook just isn't a place that puts people into a ""transactional mindset."" People go to interact, and they kind of seem to like pictures, but only insofar as they're sharing pictures that are (a) funny or (b) very personal and of themselves or their pets.<p>Pinterest is different. People go on Pinterest to look at pictures of stuff that they like or that they think is cool. Yeah, I can't get into the Pinterest thing either, but I know a few people who do, and I have to say that that model - getting people to amass collections of stuff they think is neat or cool - is much, much more likely to put people in an buyer mindset than most social networking models.<p>And as a few people have shared above, it seems as though advertising on Pinterest has a lot of momentum; many companies have reported extremely good results.

Amazon is great for searching, pretty good for browsing, but pretty awful for browse-searching, where you're trying to narrow down results via search but still browse through them using various sorting and filtering types.

I'll figure out what I want to buy for a new computer system on Newegg, because their combined browse-search is way better than Amazon's, and then take the final result and see if it is worth buying on Amazon via a direct parts name/number search.  Amazon loses about 10-20% of the sales I would have otherwise just given them due to this when it turns out the cost to buy the item on the other site I was using is similar enough to the Amazon price.

(My personal favorite? Disallowing students to bring their own books to read after they finished the test to ""encourage"" them to check their work instead of hurrying through so they could read the next chapter of <i>The Hunger Games</i>. Talk about easy ways to incite student frustration and contempt!)<p>I can attest to students finishing a test in less than 10 minutes despite being given more than an hour, or refusing to do <i>any of the test at all</i>. I've heard horror stories of students using the multiple-choice answer documents to make pictures by filling in the bubbles, or simply choosing to color in bubbles so lightly that they can't possibly be read. I know of examples in prior years wherein students chose to write essays about how much they hate testing on the essay portion instead of addressing the infantile tripe they were assigned.<p>Now, these are obviously exceptions to the rule (I'm a bit biased, but I think our students are almost uniformly excellent), but it is amazing how much damage one student can do by choosing not to care. (Or, in some cases, using their answers to vent their frustration).<p>And why should they? As far as I know, rewarding students for higher performance is disallowed, leaving teachers with very few tools with which to convince students that these tests matter. Sure, you can go on and on about how their scores will be ""important"" in their future (which, to my knowledge, isn't always true), but that only goes so far. Sometime during the 2 weeks of intensive testing, the kids just don't care anymore.<p>I'm all for assessing the performance of teachers, and I'm not sure how to fix the problem (or even if it can be fixed), but one thing seems clear to me: they're doing it wrong.<p>[Updated to fix punctuation errors]",1337228545

The stakes are far, far higher, but fundamentally it comes down to all the institutions of a society self-organizing themselves into coalitions for the assumption or protection of power. ""Reason"" amounts to a way to mask rhetorical flourishes to convince dupes that they're morally better or smarter than the other side.<p>And if you're turning to the Wall Street Journal or New York Times to learn about the finer points of Nozick's critique of Rawlsian liberalism... well, then you're the dupe, even if it's of a ""pox-on-both-your-houses"" variety. Thinking too hard about whatever outrage-of-the-day Mitt or Obama has done is a similar waste of time--it's not that there isn't conceivably some correct position about whether eating a dog or strapping them to your roof reflects worse on your character, it's just that it's all a smokescreen.<p>Given that, I'd say you have to pick a side. If you end up rejecting politics because it isn't the Oxford debating society, you've essentially let the other side deprive your own side of a valuable resource. It might suck that you're stuck in a game not of your own choosing, but if someone's kicking you on the ground, you don't quietly accept it because they're not following Marquees of Queensbury rules.",1337227835

People who have an interest in something invest lots of energy into understanding it. Judging someone by there ability not to understand something that they have invested a lot of time into doesn't make you smart, it makes that person a jerk.<p>And heres the reason. Calling someone stupid is an insult, a way of asserting a dominant position i.e. ""I am better than you because my understanding is more advanced."" Guess what, thats one hell of arrogant position to have.<p>As someone who usually runs teams I'd probably ask to someone who used statements like that to be transferred. If said person held an attitude like that, its not helpful to the team, potentially damaging to someone trying to get up to speed, undermining confidence. And lastly it wrecks of someone who would hold a something over someone else to look better rather than cooperate, build needlessly complicated code that half the team couldn't work on at a decent speed.<p>Anyway theres a quote attributed to Einstein I'm sure you've heard which sums it up nicely for me ""Everybody is a genius.

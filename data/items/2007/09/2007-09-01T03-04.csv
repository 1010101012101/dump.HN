What do you guys think?

49138,comment,48770,49130,0,0,euccastro,,,"I can think of other reasons why people would do boring stuff.  This is by no means an orthogonal breakdown!<p>- Militance:  They believe in a cause and do some sacrifices to further it.  Like translating software and docs into an obscure language.  This can be done by zealots of the software, of the language, or both.<p>- Self-image (somewhat related to the above): After having completed the sexy parts, you care about the appearance of your project as a whole, so you fill in the boring parts.<p>- Pleasing users (somewhat related to the above): You get hooked in a virtuous feedback cycle with your users.  Some things that would be boring in themselves get done in anticipation of the positive feedback.<p>- Competitiveness: a mix of the two above.  You want to be the best at what you do, and the boring stuff offers opportunities to differentiate.<p>- Scratch a personal itch: I think many Linux device drivers get done because of this. Also most of the external bug reporting (and most of the business sponsorship.)<p>- The long tail of vocation: what is boring to most is probably <i>someone's</i> joy.<p>- Retribution: You love an open source product as an user, so you give back.<p>- Social acceptance: You want to become part of the community of contributors.  You aren't qualified to do the hard stuff yet.<p>In MMOG's, lots of people volunteer for Game Masters, which is an euphemism for unpaid customer service.   They do very boring, repetitive work for the benefit of a for-profit company that gives them absolutely nothing in return (indeed, it's legally dangerous to give them anything in return). <p>So don't underestimate people's ability to do drudge work for free.",1188616893

49136,comment,48906,48906,0,0,gscott,,,"If you can buy a season of episodes on DVD for about $40 and there are 24 episodes in a season that is close to $2 per episode.  There is packaging and profit from the store so NBC does seem to be unreasonable in this case.  Regardless there is content coming from everywhere and networks have a lot of competition, so even so a few will miss the content there will be so much content you wouldn't hardly know a few shows are available, rather then visiting hulu.com people will just buy some other show to watch.",1188615879
49135,comment,49093,49093,0,0,blats,,,"The writer makes assumptions that strike me as completely arbitrary in this article and I feel the need to comment.<p>The writer quotes a ""law"" which states that in order for a computer system to be balanced the hertz of the CPU, the bytes of RAM, and the bps of IO should be the same. I shrugged it off to an old quote taking in assumptions of the time in which it was penned. I continued to read, expecting that he was illustrating a point. Then I see:<p>""So using GigE as our interconnect, a perfectly balanced system would have 1 GHz CPUs, and 1 GB of RAM for each core.""<p>How can one assume that the clock of the CPU has anything at all to do with the amount of ram or network IO for a ""balanced"" configuration? Is it 32b or 64b processor? How wide and fast is the front side bus? Does it use a minimal instruction set or a full featured IA style set. How long is the pipeline? In effect, how much work does it do per unit time? Is this not the real question?<p>Also, how much data can you store and read from RAM per unit time? This information seems at least equally as important for an evaluation of balance as the total amount of RAM available. And finally, what is the workload? Will the parameters of the computing workload not completely determine the optimal ""balance"" of hardware capabilities?<p>I am commenting here as a reality check on my own thoughts about this article. Am I missing something or is this guy totally off the mark with this ""law"" and computing balance equation?",1188615856

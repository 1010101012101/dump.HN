4123658,comment,4115942,4116154,1,0,lsc,,,">There was a comment (I think here) yesterday that said, effectively, ""Upgradability was a defect of technology not being 'good enough' for long periods"".<p>eh I think that comment is missing the real lifecycle of tech.  First, it goes to the mac users.  People that are willing to pay a large premium for something super stylish that they don't have to screw with.  These people don't want to upgrade; that defeats the whole point of paying extra so they don't have to screw with it.<p>Two to three years down the road, the hardware gets discarded by the 'my bicycle has no flywheel' set and ends up with one of my people.  At that point, it matters that we can't upgrade the ram or the disk, as there are going to be dramatically better parts at that point.<p>Of course, apple doesn't care;  I mean, I'm sure apple bears us no ill-will, but apple has no reason to go out of their way to make our lives easier.  We're not going to spend that kind of scratch on a laptop.<p>You see the same thing with electric and hybrid vehicles; Their batteries are out of warranty and will be completely useless around the time that they drop into the price range where I'd consider buying them;  and a new battery pack kicks them out of my price range again.  But why would Tesla or Toyota care?  I'm not going to buy a new car from them.<p>(of course, like I said, manufacturers of high-end new stuff have no reason to care about 'my people' - so eh, from the manufacturer's standpoint, you are correct, but there is a whole ecosystem of scavengers that will be disappointed by this trend.)",1339963105

I remember in the mid-90s there was a silly commercial firewall product called the 'Sidewinder' that touted the ability to 'strike back' at attackers, which I believe launched a daemon that tried to trace the origin of the attacker.  They were targeted at the enterprise and cost like $50k.<p>The pointy-haired types at the place where I worked at the time were extremely excited by this notion, and thought it was the coolest thing in the world, so guys I knew on the network team were tasked with deploying them into production throughout the various zones in our network topology.<p>I remember the horror stories, our network guys couldn't ever to get them to work quite right, and they were always 'striking back' seemingly randomly against phantom threats, eventually causing crippling load on the machine.  Eventually the feature was turned off, and a little bit later they were replaced by commodity Linux boxes.  To this day whenever this group of friends and I discuss a new firewall product or technology we often ask dramatically ""BUT CAN IT STRIKE BACK!?""",1339962484

4123636,comment,4123512,4123512,31,0,johnnyg,,,"The CPAP industry is as bad or worse. Here are the drivers I see:<p>1. FDA -> Medicare -> Private Insurance. They set the reimbursement codes and what each code will pay. On the internet, you throw up a website and the <i>customer</i> decides if your approach has value. With a pay per code system, anything outside of the sanctioned approach is either puts you at legal risk (""you aren't allowed to do this, it is not sanctioned"") or financial risk (""thanks for the better way, but it disrupts money flow X in the system, so we're not giving you a reimbursement code"").<p>2. The ""Insurance is better"" customer bias. The average consumer of healthcare expects to show up, slap their insurance card down and receive treatment. This abstracts them from being the direct payment entity of the services they provide. If you piss off the patient but provide the service to code, then the insurance company will pay. If you please the customer but go outside the payment structure, the insurance will not pay. Businesses get paid.<p>3. Regulatory and bureaucratic haze. Go to a CPAP trade show some time, it is a different world. No one is focused on improving technology and services for the CPAP user. They want to get together and lobby to prevent reimbursement cuts. They want to make sure the business they run stays good with the new regulations and can survive the next wave of audits. They do not shop machines to find what works for the patients, they have too many other stakeholders to please: referring physicians, insurance payors, what their front lines people have experience setting up. They are an extension of a giant that has far more control and say about their own business than they do. They fight back or buck the trend, they are literally audited out of business or worse.<p>4. Talent Deficit. There are very few places to innovate and if you find a line and do it, you have to fight the system hating you for doing it on top of the normal startup pains. It takes very special people to want to walk that road with you. For the bigs in the industry, mfgs and large insurance based sellers of equipment, their HR departments are hiring for technical positions based on resume check boxes and history with microsoft. The products they put out are heavily windows, heavily compliant, fearful of making waves with any stake holder. You can't build a better one and win because you won't get paid and don't have a network to leverage. People who could come in and really make bold moves get on the ground, see the reality and leave to do something easier.",1339962273

4123595,story,,,20,8,dlgeek,"Post-Mortem of AWS Outage",,"[Self-post because it's not easily linkable]<p>We would like to share some detail about the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service event last night when power was lost to some EC2 instances and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes in a single Availability Zone in the US East Region.<p>At approximately 8:44PM PDT, there was a cable fault in the high voltage Utility power distribution system.  Two Utility substations that feed the impacted Availability Zone went offline, causing the entire Availability Zone to fail over to generator power. All EC2 instances and EBS volumes successfully transferred to back-up generator power.   At 8:53PM PDT, one of the generators overheated and powered off because of a defective cooling fan.  At this point, the EC2 instances and EBS volumes supported by this generator failed over to their secondary back-up power (which is provided by a completely separate power distribution circuit complete with additional generator capacity).  Unfortunately, one of the breakers on this particular back-up power distribution circuit was incorrectly configured to open at too low a power threshold and opened when the load transferred to this circuit.  After this circuit breaker opened at 8:57PM PDT, the affected instances and volumes were left without primary, back-up, or secondary back-up power.  Those customers with affected instances or volumes that were running in multi-Availability Zone configurations avoided meaningful disruption to their applications; however, those affected who were only running in this Availability Zone, had to wait until the power was restored to be fully functional.<p>The generator fan was fixed and the generator was restarted at 10:19PM PDT.  Once power was restored, affected instances and volumes began to recover, with the majority of instances recovering by 10:50PM PDT.  For EBS volumes (including boot volumes) that had inflight writes at the time of the power loss, those volumes had the potential to be in an inconsistent state.  Rather than return those volumes in a potentially inconsistent state, EBS brings them back online in an impaired state where all I/O on the volume is paused.  Customers can then verify the volume is consistent and resume using it.  By 1:05AM PDT, over 99% of affected volumes had been returned to customers with a state 'impaired' and paused I/O to the instance.<p>Separate from the impact to the instances and volumes, the EBS-related EC2 API calls were impaired from 8:57PM PDT until 10:40PM PDT.  Specifically, during this time period, mutable EBS calls (e.g. create, delete) were failing.  This also affected the ability for customers to launch new EBS-backed EC2 instances.  The EC2 and EBS APIs are implemented on multi-Availability Zone replicated datastores. The EBS datastore is used to store metadata for resources such as volumes and snapshots.  One of the primary EBS datastores lost power because of the event.  The datastore that lost power did not fail cleanly, leaving the system unable to flip the datastore to its replicas in another Availability Zone.  To protect against datastore corruption, the system automatically flipped to read-only mode until power was restored to the affected Availability Zone.  Once power was restored, we were able to get back into a consistent state and returned the datastore to read-write mode, which enabled the mutable EBS calls to succeed.  We will be implementing changes to our replication to ensure that our datastores are not able to get into the state that prevented rapid failover.<p>Utility power has since been restored and all instances and volumes are now running with full power redundancy.  We have also completed an audit of all our back-up power distribution circuits.  We found one additional breaker that needed corrective action.  We've now validated that all breakers worldwide are properly configured, and are incorporating these configuration checks into our regular testing and audit processes.<p>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience to those who were impacted by the event.",1339961085

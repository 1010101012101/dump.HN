409761,comment,408786,408786,0,0,bbgm,,,"I think Friedman makes a fair point.  I've lived in three very different countries for some lengths of time, and traveled to many others over the years, so the following is a little more than anecdotal.  When I first came to the US several years ago, my first reaction was that in many ways (and remember this was over a decade ago) the US was a little backwards, culturally, socially and most definitely when it came to infrastructure and facilities.  Is it still the technological leader of the world?  Yes, but that's less due to its own efforts and more due to sheer inertia from the heyday of US technology and an inability of the rest of the world to take advantage of the sense of ennui that seems to be pervasive.<p>There are many countries, out there, young democracies (or not), that are hungry, eager.  When they figure it out, watch out.  You can't assume that the US will stay ahead forever.<p>America does need a reboot.  Our future depends on it.",1230238475

409759,comment,409562,409642,0,0,qqq,,,"> I don't understand why anybody considers profit evil if said profit is not gotten through fraud or coercion.<p>For example, Marx said that more capitalism logically leads to subsistence living conditions for the workers. He gave arguments for this. I think they are mistaken, but if you are wondering why people think profit is evil, that's a reason. Marx said that without fraud or coercion, and just free trade, most people will have very bad lives.<p>And, yes, obviously one can live in the US for a lot less than minimum wage, and be doing a lot better than the subsistence conditions Marx had in mind from his own time period. So Marxism is blatantly, factually inapplicable to the US (whether that's b/c Marxism is false, or b/c the US has been saved by it's non-pure capitalism with govt intervention is not obvious just from the plain facts). Why people are blind to this is a tough question.",1230238023

409732,comment,409609,409640,0,0,zack,,,"From Wikipedia:<p>Intelligence<p>As a group, the crows show remarkable examples of intelligence, and Aesop's fable of The Crow and the Pitcher shows that humans have long viewed the crow as an intelligent animal. Crows and ravens often score very highly on intelligence tests. Certain species top the avian IQ scale. Crows in the northwestern U.S. show modest linguistic capabilities and the ability to relay information over great distances, live in complex, hierarchic societies involving hundreds of individuals with various ""occupations"", and have an intense rivalry with the area's less socially advanced ravens. Wild hooded crows in Israel have learned to use bread crumbs for bait-fishing. Crows will engage in a kind of mid-air jousting, or air-""chicken"" to establish pecking order.<p>One species, the New Caledonian Crow, has also been intensively studied recently because of its ability to manufacture and use its own tools in the day-to-day search for food, including dropping seeds into a heavy trafficked street and waiting for a car to crush them open. On October 5, 2007, researchers from the University of Oxford, England presented data acquired by mounting tiny video cameras on the tails of New Caledonian Crows. It turned out that they use a larger variety of tools than previously known, plucking, smoothing and bending twigs and grass stems to procure a variety of foodstuffs. Crows in Queensland Australia have learned how to eat the toxic cane toad by flipping the cane toad on its back and violently stabbing the throat where the skin is thinner, allowing the crow to access the non-toxic innards; their long beaks ensure that all of the innards can be removed.",1230235290

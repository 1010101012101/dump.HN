6088320,comment,6087572,6087572,13,0,jaebrown,,,"Some of the comments on Salon are just sad. A death is a death. Whether it&#x27;s 900 or 2, drone strikes that kill innocent civilians are unacceptable. Trying to justify it by saying that there is only a small death toll number is inhumane. We can not say are objective is to protect innocent life and then take innocent life. Giving precedent to American life makes us and NATO forces seem like evil pretentious bastards. We constantly create enemies with these tactics. If your mother, brother, sister, etc.. was killed during one of these attacks, it makes it easier for you to join an extremist group to bring down the countries that had anything to do with their deaths.<p>From my readings, it seems that a lot of these group&#x27;s efforts are a lot less religious motivated and more revenge motivated now of days, hence the increase in extremist groups post 9/11. The US foreign policy since President Truman has set precedent on innocent American life and those of our allies. Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but I think all of this boils down to three words a woman from Brooklyn, NY famously said best in a popular Pop-culture rap song &quot;Money, Power, Respect&quot;. In that order as well.<p>War is money, so keeping an enemy is important. If the US ended its War on Terrorism today, there would be no other organization, faction or nation willing to step up to be Public Enemy #1. Sure we have those that could be considered (Iran and North Korea) but they tremble in a NY minute if chosen to take up the title.  A defense budget pumps trillions into the US economy; which creates return for shareholders, jobs, tax revenue (personal income), and enforces the US Foreign Policy of democracy everywhere. More spending, more borrowing; which has been the trend of the US in the past decade.<p>Power and respect are essential to America&#x27;s continued dominance as a super-force and leader amongst nations. We take a different stand on power than other rich nations. We concentrate on using our power for evil instead on good by focusing on fear. We attempt to bully with the fear of us stepping into a foreign situation; which has been manipulated over time and thru history to seem that are presence brings a win for us or our allies.<p>Respect gives others faith to continue to believe in the US; which means continued belief in the US dollar. Any lack of faith in the US dollar means lack of investing; which then turns into countries like China trying to salvaged what money they have left on their US bonds and other securities; which do not allow them to hit maturity. We then pay out what we owe; which will be nothing because that is what we have. The results are a depression because our debt is now our currency to the world and that is deflation.<p>Just my thoughts, first time I typed them out or shared for anyone to hear other than the audience I gather when talking about tech, startups, student load debt, sports or politics. Sorry about no data or sources, I just got into the zone typing but this comes from my research as an undergrad and somewhat grad student.",1374555568

Eventually they will get dismissed, and after being so may find that they are completely dysfunctional having forgotten the habits needed to get things done, and perhaps developed habits that work against them. Unemployed, hungry, and often homeless they turn to drugs or alcohol and slowly circle the drain. There was an interview with somebody who could have been this character on the CBS evening news when they were doing a story about the long term unemployed. He hadn&#x27;t been employed in over 3 years and had no transferable skills from his old job and in the past three years had not developed any new skills. So very very sad.<p>It is one thing to build up enough savings such that you can live off the 4% annual draw down stipend like MMM advocates, and <i>then</i> wasting your time.

SPS has one shipping price for all orders - $6 - which seems cheap for international so for simplicity let&#x27;s assume SPS makes no profit on shipping.<p>Their cheapest products -- Mini Squares and Prints -- are both $15 for a set of 48. Each is roughly the equivalent of 4 sheets of 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;. If the cost per sheet of glossy thick 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cardstock is about $0.05 and the cost to print, cut, package and prep for shipping is $0.05 then the cost to print an order is ~ $0.50.<p>Let&#x27;s use $10M for their annual revenue. If their average order is $25 (including $6 for shipping) that&#x27;s 400,000 orders.<p>$25 (gross revenue) - $6 (shipping) - $0.50 (printing & prep) = $18.50.<p>x 400k orders = $7.4 million<p>Let&#x27;s say each employee costs $100k/year. They have 10 employees, so now SPS is left with $6.4 million.<p>Their next highest costs might be: marketing, office space, servers, employee computers and professional services e.g. attorney. Add to that other costs of doing business like chargebacks and returns, and call it another $1 million in annual expenses.<p>Even if I am now overestimating actual profit by an order of magnitude, the founders or investors of SPS are still doing well. This in a market I would have bet was oversaturated. But most startups competing in this space probably do not think to run their supply chain and distribution from China. Not to mention the other areas of the business that SPS appears to be executing nicely on.",1374555149

6088242,comment,6087572,6087572,1,0,bloaf,,,"Most people I see comfortably opining on drone strikes seem to be doing so without the discomfort of thinking the issue through.  My thought process is this:<p>Say the US were to find evidence that a Canadian terrorist group was planning an attack on the Joe Louis Arena.  We would inform the Canadian government who would then go, arrest the terrorists and put them on trial.  This seems to be what drone critics think should happen in countries like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.  There are some pretty obvious problems with that position.<p>Countries like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia all have weak, corrupt, ineffective governments.  Naturally, they also have weak, corrupt, ineffective police forces.  Normally, the US government doesn&#x27;t care.  The US government is responsible for US citizens, and Pakistan&#x27;s problems are the responsibility of the Pakistani people&#x27;s government.  However, the US now perceives some groups within those countries as threats.  We could give the Pakistani government all the info we like, but unlike Canada, we can&#x27;t realistically expect that to result in the arrests of the terrorists.  Even if we tried to give lots of support to their police forces, it is almost certain that the terrorists would be informed about any and all police movements (e.g. Bin Laden lived down the street from a Pakistani military academy.)<p>So what should we do?<p>Ignoring the threat is too great a political risk.  If Pakistani terrorists executed so much as a single attack on US soil, you better believe the headlines would read: &quot;Politicians knew of terrorist threat, failed to act.&quot;<p>No US law enforcement agency is effectively equipped to police Pakistan.  We can&#x27;t ask NYPD to go police the Pakistanis, that&#x27;s stupid.  The FBI is the best candidate, but their responsibilities are primarily investigative; the actual subduing of the terrorists is outside their purview.<p>The only other real option is some form of military action.  Technically this violates Pakistan&#x27;s sovereignty, but who cares?  Pakistan is a weak government, it can&#x27;t even police its own country.  It&#x27;s politicians may object, but it is not going to start a war with the US.  Moreover, Pakistani terrorists not only kill lots of Pakistani civilians, but also are incredibly costly[1].  Therefore, many politicians will actually support the US&#x27;s intervention, even if they have to publicly distance themselves.  Obviously military intervention carries the risk of civilian casualties, but remember that the US government&#x27;s responsibilities are towards US citizens.  It is the Pakistani government&#x27;s responsibility to protect Pakistanis, and it is a failing of the Pakistanis if they have not created a government capable of protecting them.<p>What sort of military intervention should we use?  We could send in soldiers to try and arrest the terrorists, but that is slow, risky, and expensive (we need holding facilities, transportation, etc.)   Drones are the obvious alternative.  Not only are they cheap, they are pose about zero risk to US personnel.  People mention that drones may create terrorists, but if we assume that Pakistani public opinion is proportional to the number of deaths, then terrorism (which has killed far more innocent Pakistanis than drones [2]) ought to be significantly less popular.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Pakistan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Pakistan</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_Pakistan_since_2001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_...</a>",1374553804

This law is specifically for &quot;Circumvention of copyright protection systems&quot;. Does Snapchat own the copyright of pictures distributed using its software? or rather do the users own the copyright? I suspect the answer to this is the latter -- that users own the copyright to the works distributed, and this would render the law irrelevant. Moreover, I would argue that the software protections put in place by Snapchat are for reasons of privacy not for reasons to enforce copyright.",1374552794

How do these scenarios play out in a <i>domestic</i> environment?<p>> How do we get this from &quot;Think of the Children&quot; + &quot;Women Need to be Controlled?&quot;<p>Because fathers are not expected to have such a strong connection to their children. The chain of command is &quot;Man -> Mother -> Child&quot;. A woman&#x27;s first and foremost responsibility, in this way of thinking, is the well-being of the child. Only when she can&#x27;t handle it does she appeal to the man. The obedience of the child derives directly from the obedience of its mother.<p>Thus, the man&#x27;s job in parenting is to provide from afar. He does not sully his hands by dealing with silly emotional issues; he brings bread home and punishes any misbehavior that isn&#x27;t dealt with by the mother.<p>In this model of the world, the mother is useful only as an intermediary to handle messy things like diaper-changing and doctor visits and crying. She is the hammer that pounds down the nail. This particular role and objectification must be <i>justified</i>. That justification is that there is a Super Special Bond of Specialness that makes her uniquely qualified so that no one else could usurp her place.<p>Honestly, there is so much cultural detritus to point out as context that, if I made dealing with sexism my life&#x27;s work, I could probably put together a book or two on the subject.",1374552787

6088189,comment,6087743,6088038,1,0,simonster,,,"I don&#x27;t think this is quite right. If the null hypothesis is true and you conduct the same study an infinite number of times, you will reject the null hypothesis 5% of the time at alpha = 0.05 regardless of sample size, unless there is something wrong with your sampling procedure or hypothesis test. This is the point of null hypothesis significance testing.<p>In practice, if you fix p=0.05 and increase your n, the probability that you will find a statistically significant result often <i>increases</i> because your power increases, and in many situations, the probability that the null hypothesis is true is close to zero. (Andrew Gelman uses the example of asking whether there are significant differences between voting patterns of men and women.)<p>On the other hand, effect size estimates become more accurate as the sample size increases. This mitigates the above issue, provided you actually report your effect size. It also means that small sample studies that report statistically significant results are more likely to overestimate their effect size, which is especially problematic if you are applying null hypothesis significance testing when you know the null hypothesis is false.",1374552767

And take advantage of modern web browsers&#x27; layout compatibilities, complete with CSS styling, and all the cool new stuff like CSS regions & shapes. Right?<p>Apparently not.<p>If you go into Pages and open up web inspector, what you&#x27;ll see is not a nice clean HTML structure with the text written in HTML and formatting in CSS. Instead, you&#x27;ll see a large collection of dynamically-generated SVG <text> elements, with pixel-exact positions explicitly specified, even to the level of the horizontal locations of individual glyphs. This effectively completely bypasses the browser&#x27;s own layout capabilities. They appear to have written their own layout engine <i>in javascript</i>, or perhaps ported over the existing native Pages one.<p>Any ideas why they would have taken this route? Apple and Adobe have both been doing some fantastic work on improving WebKit with better layout facilities, and Microsoft have been doing the same with IE. Things are pretty good in 2013.

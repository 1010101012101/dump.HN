52888,comment,52807,52886,0,0,aston,,,"I read a paper that talked about the difference between dyslexic reading and normal reading. The researchers found that dyslexic people actually see too much at once and that by forcing them to focus on a smaller region of text (by, for example, having them read through a small hole in a piece of paper), they had much better performance. With consistent drills, they could even read without the mask.<p>edit: <a href=""http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/pdf/geiger1992.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/pdf/geiger1992.pdf</a>",1189450460

52884,comment,52606,52867,0,0,ratsbane,,,"I strongly agree with the article and with mdakin's point; scp is good but rsync is better.  ftp is awkward, flawed, and obsolete.  I am amazed that it is still used as much as it is.  Perhaps the problem is largely due to Windows admins.  ssh still doesn't ship with Windows and too many Windows admins aren't familiar with it.",1189450152

52872,comment,52823,52823,0,0,simpleenigma,,,"Just this morning I wrote and email to the 3 other people involved in the project I was working on explaining why I was leaving and what I felt the correct split up was.<p>I had been doing the majority of the work and the rest of the team was not performing to the level I had expected as well as not meeting several deadlines that they had agreed to.<p>The only real sticky part is that the really great flashy idea was from one of the other people, who has the potential to pull a ConnectU, but not really a leg to stand on.<p>No one besides me wrote a bit of code, except there was a minimalistic HTML design stuff.<p>I made sure to explain what my reasons were for the split and why I was leaving and did say that I intended to make something derivative, although not in direct competition. The platform was more interesting to me then the community site that was the other person's idea. So I'll just think it through and find another way to implement the community aspect without the exact implementation that he had.<p>The bottom line is that this happens and it is better to make the break earlier, especially before the incorporation. Start looking for a new co-founder and get a better sense of their work before you enter into any kind of a partnership.<p>As for the IP part of it, that's life. If you never share the idea with anyone without legal papers first you'll never share the idea with anyone who will help you with it in the early stages.<p>Also, make sure that they are on the same page as you concerning work ethics and integrity. They might be able to become a better hacker, but if they are trying to trick people and pulling underhanded stunts that is a direct reflection on you ...",1189447801
52871,comment,52852,52852,0,0,aston,,,"I think I probably would've passed on giving The Facebook money at a $15 million valuation during that first year. The article notes that the user base was in the small thousands, so not so much evidence that it had any traction. And there were certainly competitors as well (some of whom actually had a better feature set). Not to mention the whole uncertainty of deriving revenue from the site, an issue Facebook's still dealing with today.<p>edit: I missed the latter part of the article. It indicates that Thiel chipped in in half of Zuckerberg's ""minimum,"" for well short of his proposed valuation to Battery.",1189447532

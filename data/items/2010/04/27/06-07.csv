Faster than locks, usually. It's going to be great.<p>For example, did you know that you can get a highly scalable priority queue data structure by just using a skip list and hardware transactional memory? It's so simple that I felt almost ripped off when I realized how much easier TM makes it. If you've ever tried to make a concurrent priority queue with locks or compare-and-swap primitives, you'll be pleasantly surprised by how much easier it could have been if only we had hardware transactional memory.",1272348376

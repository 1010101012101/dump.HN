If you take the time to study and understand the physics involved and bother to do a bit of math none of it is particularly difficult.  I reject the characterization of this as some kind of a black art.  It&#x27;s not magic.  Yes, of course, experience helps, but it isn&#x27;t magic.

8790688,comment,8781435,8790311,0,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"Rust definitely allows data sharing.  It just doesn&#x27;t allow data races.<p>> If you define data races to not include race conditions that your code is handling (by placement of atomics, fences, locking etc.) then maybe your points make some sense but it is exactly the code handling these that I am saying does not fit with what I have seen rust advocates claim.<p>Its actual guarantees for atomics are not very strong and let you handle all of those things in safe code.  What&#x27;s interesting is that it can guarantee correct behavior for types that have more interesting semantics than &quot;a bytestring,&quot; like mutexes or smart pointers.  The implementations of those things are still unsafe, but you can generally provide a safe API to them, which you can&#x27;t do in most other languages.  This is because Rust has the notion of thread safety built into the language and enforced by the type system.  For example, Rust&#x27;s `shared_ptr` equivalent, `Arc<T>` is defined to be thread safe to share and send to other threads if and only if `T` is also thread safe to share and send to other threads.  That doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t build up a safe type from the lower level atomics, or Rust isn&#x27;t suited for this domain.  It means you can write safe APIs in Rust that you can&#x27;t in C++.<p>> You have to reason about these things at some level, and what I hear people advocate on hn is to sidestep it all by preventing sharing, which may be a fine idea but doesn&#x27;t work for everything.<p>Rust just forces you to do <i>just enough</i> synchronization to not have undefined behavior.  It&#x27;s not a dogmatic language and doesn&#x27;t believe there is one right way to do concurrency.  Channels were just removed from the prelude for precisely that reason--they&#x27;re not particularly favored over other concurrency mechanisms.<p>> Lastly, in my mind, if your lock free algorithm works by letting the races happen but using the result of an atomic op and/or fences to ensure consistent behavior, I would still call that a (benign) race. That you needed atomics, fences, or compiler hints to get what you want seems orthogonal.<p>Data races are well-defined, and what you&#x27;re describing aren&#x27;t data races, benign or otherwise.  You basically never want data races, just like you basically never to dereference a dangling pointer.  Rust prevents things you basically never want, it doesn&#x27;t prevent writing useful things like lock-free data structures.",1419375390

8790686,comment,8789530,8790041,0,0,dubfan,,,"> * GMOs tend to promote monoculture and pesticide use.<p>That&#x27;s true for industrialized agriculture in general and not specific to GMOs. Growing GMOs doesn&#x27;t promote monoculture or pesticide use any more than growing conventional crops do. In fact the same farmers that grow GMOs often grow conventional crops at the same time, or switch from year to year, with very little change in their practices.<p>> * Studies have shown that the same developments that make GMOs more insect resistant can also make them more difficult to digest.<p>Without knowing what studies those are, it&#x27;s impossible for me to rebut or defend it. I will say, the record on studies that claim to show that GMOs have safety issues is not a good one (<a href=""http://academicsreview.org/2012/09/scientists-smell-a-rat-in-fraudulent-study/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academicsreview.org/2012/09/scientists-smell-a-rat-in...</a>)<p>> * When it comes to animals, GMOs tend to have much poorer quality of life and tend to be completely incapable of surviving without constant support (chickens who can&#x27;t stand on their own, cows who can&#x27;t go more than 48 hours without milking, etc).<p>I am not aware of any GM livestock in use. Monsanto, the bogeyman of anti-GMO activists, does not research or produce GM animals. AFAIK the only GM animals on the market are things like glowing goldfish.<p>> * GMOs almost never focus on the true value of a food item, but rather the sell value. A food that looks nutritious is more valuable than one that actually is and GMOs make it easier to create that false association (deep red tomatos that taste like wall paper glue, etc).<p>Again this is a broader symptom of industrialized food production and is not related to GMOs. Yes, there are GM traits that are meant to do what you expect (e.g. the Flavr Savr tomato which was a commercial flop, and the Arctic Apple which is just recently rolling out) but this is a trend that goes back decades.",1419375353

Many still image codecs are modified intraprediction modes from video codecs. So it&#x27;s really a subset[0] of the constraints and optimizations, not a totally different set.<p>It&#x27;s also the case we&#x27;ve recently spent a lot of time working on intraprediction issues (and related topics). One reason for that is that the lapping filters make intraprediction very difficult compared to traditional codec designs.<p>Demo2[1] explains much of this difficulty in the context of a solution that we tried and had to abandon. The paint demo[2] explains another solution we tried, which also failed, but which is now the basis of a post-filtering technique.<p>[0] Modulo things like color format support, metadata, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/daala/demo2.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/daala/demo2.shtml</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://people.xiph.org/~jm/daala/paint_demo/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://people.xiph.org/~jm/daala/paint_demo/</a>",1419375066

When a work that would otherwise enter the public domain is instead kept copyrighted, that is essentially privatisation of public property. If congress decided to sell national parks to private owners there would be a massive outcry. The idea that they would just <i>give</i> them to private owners for free would be considered utterly absurd. Yet this is exactly what extension of copyrights is. At very least, people would insist a proper valuation be put on them and the benefactors asked to pay a commensurate amount to the public to compensate the loss of public property.

Is this position prejudiced if it&#x27;s based on thorough examination and reasoning? If people come by this position based on evidence and reason, do you have a reason to believe they could never be convinced they&#x27;re mistaken? Finally, is there something wrong with being intolerant of intolerance, oppression and violence?<p>People compare social institutions, technologies and ideas all the time. And people develop opinions on them; some are viewed as better than others. This is the social learning process which has taken us (more or less) from cave dwelling, widespread violence, ignorance, slavery and &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; to the foundations modern societies rest on, more or less to everyone&#x27;s approval. You wouldn&#x27;t be trying to use a knee-jerk negative word to discourage, for religions, the kind of discussion which has stood us in good stead in many other areas of social discourse?<p>I hope you won&#x27;t be too offended by this literally shitty analogy that was the first to come to my mind: Imagine a modern society just like ours, but in which people choose to do without toilets. Nobody talks about it much, it&#x27;s just what they&#x27;ve always done, and they&#x27;re unwilling to break with tradition in this respect. It&#x27;s common practice to do your &quot;business&quot; in the street gutter, next to the curb. There&#x27;s a daily removal service, and a 3x daily deodorizing service, and they reduce the associated problems. Still, this society has an unusual rate of some infectious diseases, and especially in the summer, deodorizing just doesn&#x27;t seem to keep up. Here&#x27;s a different society with a different choice on how to do things.<p>Would you be bigoted if you criticized this society for the pursuit of this practice? If you feel it&#x27;s important to accept the choices of other groups, would you be willing to live in such a society? Would you think it wrong to at least try to talk to those folks about improving their lives by re-thinking their stance on indoor plumbing?<p>I think I still owe you the answer to your question. So: Yes, I think it&#x27;s OK to critically examine all ideas, and choices, including religious ones, and to raise those objections we feel are in order. Why on Earth not?",1419375016

Candidates were given projects in each area, and a week to complete all of them.<p>It was deliberately structured so that there was no possible way that anyone could humanly complete the entire set of tests, much less while also working a full time job. This was deliberate, so that they could observe how candidates chose to prioritize. They also wanted to give people more than they could do to stimulate a &quot;by any means necessary&quot; approach they knew would be required in the actual job.<p>Finally, it also caused a lot of people to say &quot;erm, no thanks.

Already I am skeptical of the methodology.<p><i>&quot;While it can be difficult to determine guilt in a single case, my intuition is that a person independently accused of assault by multiple people is quite unlikely to be innocent.&quot;</i><p>Just so we&#x27;re clear here: intuition is a heuristic, which is incredibly flawed and only intended to be used as a potential risk indicator for split-second decisions. Any time you hear of something risky you are more inclined to believe it because to <i>not</i> believe it would potentially open yourself up to risk. The only way to mitigate it is to have additional information or motive that overrides the unknown risk.<p>Back to the model: they cite one study on sexual assault. Do you know how many actual studies there have been on sexual assault? Not many. Do you know how many of them had widely varying results? Most of them. Do you know how many had different methodologies which changed the nature of the model? All of them. So I guess let&#x27;s ignore that someone could probably pick a different study that would change the results.<p>So what does this particular study say? The study involved asking 2,000 men at one college in one state about their sex lives. (Random sampling? Who needs that?) Of those men, about six percent admitted to sex that fell under the legal definition of rape without consent of the woman, which includes force or alcohol.<p>Consider for a moment that the legal guidelines basically say that if you have a bottle of wine with your girlfriend and you end up in bed together, it&#x27;s rape if there wasn&#x27;t a consent agreement. In this case they&#x27;re only asking the men and making a judgement based on the legal framework, and not asking the women about their relationship or if there was consent, which could <i>possibly</i> change the results. But anyway,<p><i>&quot;I think the UVA episode illustrates precisely why statistics are so important -- because anything can happen in a single story, making it a risky thing to hang a cause on.&quot;</i><p>So why would you create a model based on a single limited study, and not at the very least recreate your model based on the data from other studies?<p><i>&quot;Regardless of what really happened at UVA, the broader trend is clear: the rate of campus sexual assaults is high (20%, says CDC, although better data should be collected); the rate of false accusations is low (this review cites 6 studies which all yield estimates between 2% and 8%, lower than the rate of false reports for car theft).&quot;</i><p>Another study said the campus assaults were 90%. The CSA final report put it at 13.7%. And (all) the false accusation studies were collected and analyzed by Philip N.S. Rumney and determined that due to the unreliable research methodologies used, along with unreliable judgements by law enforcement, it was impossible to give a plausible statistic.<p>I&#x27;ve always found that people rely on statistics when they want a nice simple number to sum up their opinions, and don&#x27;t want to deal with the fact that there is no simple, clean way to summarize complicated, wide-ranging circumstances, events and behaviors.",1419373643

Instead of just studying objects, operations and equations, like &quot;a group is a set g, together with multiplication + certain axioms&quot; one studies objects, relations between objects, relations between relations etc. To study this up to level two, you visualize objects as regions in 2d space, relations between objects as lines between them and relations between relations as points where lines meet. Equations are then equalities between such pictures. If you look at those equalities as a dynamic process, which starts at time t=0 with one picture and time t=1 with the other, you get a picture in three dimensional space, which you can visualize as a movie (to be mathematically precise after the choice of a morse function you get a movie). One of the easiest examples would be the zig-zag identity. See for example

How does mathematics look like if we weren&#x27;t constrained to 2d paper to write down equations. Of course to actually write down those things you have to somehow project the equations to several essentially 1d sections or invoke very abstract methods to reason about them. Of course algebraic topology already has tools for that.<p>The early impetus came from Grothendieck I believe, who began to create a theory of &quot;higher groupoids&quot; in several thousand pages, ordinary groupoids being categories in which every morphism is an isomorphism.",1419373570

Sexual dimorphism in sociability has been documented in humans. The present study aimed to ascertain whether the sexual dimorphism is a result of biological or socio-cultural differences between the two sexes. 102 human neonates, who by definition have not yet been influenced by social and cultural factors, were tested to see if there was a difference in looking time at a face (social object) and a mobile (physical-mechanical object). Results showed that the male infants showed a stronger interest in the physical-mechanical mobile while the female infants showed a stronger interest in the face. The results of this research clearly demonstrate that sex differences are in part biological in origin.<p><a href=""http://www.math.kth.se/matstat/gru/godis/sex.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.kth.se/matstat/gru/godis/sex.pdf</a>",1419372961

Only Delta IV has flown with a 3 core configuration. Atlas V has all the hardware so it should be able to do it if needed, but the US government hasn&#x27;t seen the need to spend the money. (No commercial uses for such large payloads.)<p>Incidentally, Atlas V uses the RD-180 engine, which as two chambers. It is derived from the Soviet RD-170 engine with four chambers, the world&#x27;s most powerful rocket engine. The RD-170 series was used by Buran (as boosters) and in the Zenit rocket (Sea Launch, also Boeing involvement) that still flies.<p>The RD-190 used in Angara is a one chamber derivative of RD-170.<p>So you could say that Angara 1 is a &quot;half of Atlas V&quot; or &quot;quarter of Zenit&quot;. Angara 5 then would be &quot;2.5 times Atlas V&quot; or &quot;1.25x Zenit&quot;.<p>But the staging improves payload, so it&#x27;s better than linear.<p>The Russians have been wanting to do such &quot;universal rockets&quot; since the dawn of the space age. They only managed to build one, so it wasn&#x27;t much of a modular system: Proton (The UR in UR-500 is from Universal Rocket). The first stage has six engines attached to six oxidizer tanks. But storable propellants were perhaps not such a good idea after all. There were big battles between Chelomei and Korolev about this. Proton has not been used for manned launches.<p>Angara seems like a very good ideal compromise design. Engines are small enough so it can be modular. It uses nontoxic propellants so it can be used for manned launches. Yet it still puts to good use the fantastic RD-170 engine technology, into which massive investments were made back in the day.<p>Reusability and competition with SpaceX: Russia has proposed to make the universal boosters of Angara reusable. Add a scissor wing and a jet engine to the nose and you get Baikal.

It seems like a coherent design to me. It will add some mass though, but might be operationally flexible if the boosters can fly long distances.
It would be costly to develop, but they have indigenous expertise on these subjects.<p>Europe hasn&#x27;t been willing to put money in big liquid engines, so they&#x27;ve needed the solid boosters for Ariane V (which was oversized, since it was designed for the Hermes mini shuttle). Seems they are going further down that road, to all-solids. No hopes of reusability. Or manned flights either. Maybe geopolitical reasons or lack of money.<p>SLS: it&#x27;s problematic because it&#x27;s so big and inflexible. There&#x27;s no money to fly something so big so often. So it will have high fixed costs. Better than Ares though. None of the solids or engines of SLS will be used for commercial use anywhere else.<p>Saturn I to Saturn V. There wasn&#x27;t much commonality, just the S-IVB stage (second in Saturn Ib and third in Saturn V). First stages were completely different, in structure and engines. Saturn I had to be whipped up quickly to test Apollo hardware and train, it was a kludge. There were plans to migrate Saturn Ib to use F-1 engines later, instead of the eight H-1.",1419372540

8790472,comment,8789975,8789975,0,0,trhway,,,"after a year and half of thorough, to the letter,  BigCo company-wide (only super important/critical projects were excepted :) push of Scrum/Agile/Lean down our throats and as result, in particular, work on our complex multi-team  project slowing down to a crawl and failing to release while everybody was super busy with their mouths foaming and not being able to catch a breath, about a year ago everybody in our BigCo almost instantly forgot these words and about associated reports/tools/meetings/bla-bla-bla - Christmas magic i guess. The only thing reminding that it wasn&#x27;t just a nightmare dream, that it was real is that our team&#x27;s weekly status meeting is called &quot;scrum meeting&quot; :)<p>Beside other failures, one of a major failures of scrum in real environment (not toy building fun exercise during a scrum course) is failure to address the multi-team environment of real multi-layered projects. A team would usually have dependencies and dependents. In scrum/sprint process a team would try to avoid committing to anything with unsatisfied dependencies which results in that any vertically dependent feature would take a series of sprints, much longer than in non-scrum environment. Add to that complete impossibility of iterations/adjustments on the feature - team A delivers to team B and team B has no chance (until a sprint much much later in the release, i.e. never) to have team A to do an additional iteration upon the delivered changes desired as a result of the actual usage by the team B. It is expectably much worse when it comes to 3 layers/teams (like persistence/framework, business logic, UI).<p>I specifically asked consultants (during 2 different courses by 2 different consulting companies and at work) about dependencies management in scrum, and blank-facing was their answer. Think about it - software development methodology without addressing inter-component/layer/team dependencies.",1419372119

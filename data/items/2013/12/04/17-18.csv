Look for something in construction - maybe with a consulting firm that works with potential clients of your future business.  Heck, they might even be interested in marketing the system you&#x27;ve developed.  Regardless, what you really want in the future is freedom and stability, and to sacrifice the health and relationships you have now for that goal is a huge price to pay.  I did it, I know.<p>Next, screw marketing - you don&#x27;t need that right now. Maybe you had bad advice or just made it up, but what you need is sales - very different from marketing.  You are the best sales person because you&#x27;re the one who saw the need and believes in your solution.  Forget websites and blogs and social media, that&#x27;s not right for you - just talk to people and get them talking to people, until you can make contact with and sit down with potential customers.

6848696,comment,6845189,6846940,1,0,adrianwaj,,,"I have no idea about Somalia and their money-printing operations. I also have no desire to purchase anything from that country, or visit it. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to buy their currency as an investment if it can be printed by anyone, or some army can come in and make those notes illegal, or the country has no economic development to make the demand for those notes increase over time. So what&#x27;s backing that currency is a number of things, with &quot;backing&quot; being a synonym for &quot;making it valuable or useful in the long term to buy things from and in Somalia.&quot; Having a country be physically protected from invasion being a large factor in that equation. Also, not only an army, but more importantly a naval force that can protect trade routes from pirates (doesn&#x27;t Somalia have its own fleet of pirate ships?? lol.)<p>The other thing to evaluate in a currency is the amount of it held by foreign countries. If all of a sudden China were to dump its US dollars, I&#x27;m sure the value would go down (but what would they buy instead?) Yet at the same time, China has an interest seeing the US survive and/or thrive to a certain extent so those dollars remain valuable and/or useful.<p>In fact, it seems the Chinese are going crazy about Bitcoins and Litecoins and it makes more sense for many to hold them than US dollars.. possibly because it allows them to make their funds available offshore and also pay bills locally.<p>As a side note, I&#x27;ve heard the Chinese have official printing plates for US dollars... another indicator about how important ubiquity is, in contrast to artificial scarcity to back a currency. If there&#x27;s a lesson to be learnt about bitcoin, I think it&#x27;s that artifical scarcity can also alienate a lot of people (even if it motivates bitcoin holders) and drive up the value of other crypto currencies, and if it was distributed more evenly from the outset, if today&#x27;s reality would be any different. So my prediction is that there&#x27;ll be a number of competing and complimentaty crypto currencies emerging supported by groups that were early adopters (or buyers) of them. If I were a fortune 100 company, it might make more sense to buy up say Litecoins on the cheap now, and then take payments in them later. (a bit off-topic, but useful to think about).. why give a free-ride to bitcoin holders? (unless the top execs are holding them.. or more likely, they&#x27;ll be buying Litecoins now, esp Chinese ones)",1386179806

We&#x27;ll conservatively assume a $5m valuation cap, and (very) conservatively assume the next round valuation (when the $80k note converts) is also $5m.

The web was built to work with content negotiation and it does this beautifully.<p>With that said, there is nothing wrong with linking to the HTML file with .html, but the developer (or user) consuming the API (or website) should not be adding suffixes to get the representation they want... the API should be returning those URLs in the response.<p>Additionally, regarding screen scraping, HTML coupled with something like RDF, Schema.org, or other microformats/microdata allows you to parse the HTML looking for that data without breaking clients on HTML changes.

6848614,comment,6845585,6847384,4,0,pron,,,"There is very little in my comment pertaining specifically to Scala. I did not like or dislike anything in the previous article as I barely skimmed it (unlike this one, which I&#x27;ve read). The specific issues mentioned in this one are all well and good, but since the main point here is about ditching an old language in favor of a new one, I responded to that. I don&#x27;t know which &quot;reasoning&quot; you&#x27;re referring to, as I simply pointed out that when discussing something that can be a major decision for a software company as switching languages, it&#x27;s best not to start with specific language features, as they may lead you down the wrong path.<p>Also, I try to form my opinions after a lot of consideration, and you can be certain that I read most arguments against them. Sometimes I remain unconvinced, as in the case of Scala. I am not prejudiced against Scala. I think Martin Odersky is a very smart PL researcher, and when Scala first came out many years ago, I actually strongly advocated adopting it in a very, very large organization. My opinion has changed over the years, partly because of the path Scala has taken, partly because of new options that are now available, and partly because I&#x27;ve gained more experience with large projects and large teams.<p>My own criticism of Scala is, I believe, well informed; the fact that you consider its lack of minute detail as lack of evidence demonstrates the Scala&#x27;s community obsession for tiny details to the detriment of a grander vision.<p>The comment you referred me to demonstrates the same. I do not dispute that Scala&#x27;s features are well integrated <i>in the compiler</i>. It&#x27;s a very nice compiler. What I meant in my comments on those other threads is that Scala mixes concepts whose mix creates a negative synergy, whose only purpose is that sometimes you can use one concept and sometimes you can use another. It doesn&#x27;t matter that case classes are implemented as classes. Conceptually, they are meant to be used differently; again, that&#x27;s getting bogged down in detail. Scala never gives a compelling <i>reason</i> why it is so useful to mix different concepts in a single language and pay such a heavy price in complexity, other than &quot;sometimes it&#x27;s better to use one and sometimes another&quot;. That&#x27;s not a hallmark of great design. What big <i>software development problem</i> (as opposed to a PL research problem) does Scala solve?",1386179136

Checking if the company exists - meaning looking over incorporation documents, validating the bank details and other information to make sure you&#x27;re funding who you think you&#x27;re funding - could be done with someone with some common sense and not a lawyer - probably hiring a person who does administration and work full time for you (the high volume of seed deals you&#x27;re making make me think you already have that person).<p>2. Checking that the IP is owned by the company is usually done by doing a TAA (Technology assignment agreement) and in that case this could be a standard doc that you let the founders sign on. I would believe that someone on your behalf could also check that the validity of the signatures.<p>3. Use a service like RightSignature to collect signature, IPs, timestamps and even Identification cards picture or something of the sort in order to check the legitimacy of the person signing on the docs - this will allow you to remove the lawyer from the equation as well.<p>4. Last but not least - try documenting the things you need from the company beforehand and post it somewhere on the site - knowing in advance what are the things you are requesting usually eliminate the unneeded ping-ping with lawyer.<p>On a personal note - I streamlined the fundraising process by creating a few templates (with wire details) and having forms on Rightsignature. I had all of my investors go through that process and closed very fast - including countersigning and dating the documents once the wire reach our account. I think every process could and should be streamlined especially if you deal with 200 companies. Lawyer like to interject in between deals because they can bill and in our case we were able to save around ~$10k in legal fees because we didn&#x27;t let our lawyers talk with our investors and negotiate for us - and we used a standard note provided by our lawyers.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you could do that but if there&#x27;s room to reduce the $4k to something like $500 or even nothing - that mean an extra $400k that can be re-invested into ~3 companies - imagine that!<p>EDIT: I know you have way more experience closing deals than me - I just wanted to offer a founder experience and perspective on that process.",1386178504

In particular, eighth grade teaches pre-algebra and algebra, so the way students approach problems is directly connected to how the student decodes the language of a &quot;word problem&quot;.<p>We need to change our conceptual understanding of what learning actually requires, and give students a situation in which they must write the problem themselves. Instead of &quot;decoding&quot; a predefined word problem, the student then must explore the situation and interpret the available information.<p>A good way to handle this problem is to allow students to write word problems for other students based on a set of data, and subsequently create the &quot;answer key&quot; that includes the mathematical proofs.

Adjust for whether parents speak English at home, adjust for educational status of parents, adjust for level of gang activity in the community, adjust for whether father figures are present, adjust for level of social integration between economic classes within the community, etc. Considering all of those things, together, would be better than using race as a proxy.

For us over two interviews you&#x27;ll speak to at least one manager, two or three developers and probably someone from the test team and or an analyst. All those people will read your CV, prepare questions, spend time interviewing you and then get together to discuss and make sure we&#x27;ve given you proper consideration and provide feedback. These are people who are generally relatively well paid and have other things they could be doing.<p>We&#x27;ll read 3 (pre-screened) CVs for each first interview, 2 short first interviews for every second interview and probably 3 long (several hours) second interviews for each offer. So to get to one offer we&#x27;ll have read 12 CVs, done 6 first interviews and 3 second interviews. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re abnormal - that&#x27;s about typical for places I&#x27;ve worked (though I&#x27;ve heard of places who are far more demanding).<p>Much of that is done based on little evidence (usually a CV which may or may not be totally factual) and it&#x27;s certainly not an indication that we want a candidate to work for us, merely that it might be something that could work out. Understanding whether it&#x27;s more than that is why we&#x27;re doing the interview.<p>My point is that we put a lot of time and effort (which has an associated cost) into seeing whether someone is a good candidate for us (and if we think this is a good job for them).<p>We don&#x27;t ask for compensation for that time so why is it reasonable for a candidate to do so?<p>A candidate absolutely has the right to say that they aren&#x27;t willing to submit to a particular interview process but I think asking for money to interview requires a very lopsided view of the process and, as a hiring manager, would have me pull the plug instantly.",1386177548

If all it was doing was slowing down a developer for a day then the company wouldn&#x27;t bother interviewing anyone that way because all it is just a cost and there is no benefit to the company. However, the company does that because they decided there is a <i>positive value</i>, an actual benefit to hiring a needed developer and knowing that they can do the job.<p>There is always a cost to hiring. When a company decides that the value of having that dev is greater than the cost of hiring them, then it makes sense to hire someone. It may not be an immediate monetary value, but the company decided they needed the dev. So they decided that slowing down a developer for a day to work with a candidate _is_ beneficial to the company.<p>Plus, like others have said, it really sounds like he was being asked to work on something that was adding value. If a company has decided a particular bug or feature is worth prioritizing then it obviously has value. That means that if a potential candidate comes in and does it, they are adding value (though whether the net value is positive or negative varies case by case).",1386176637

In Rails, for example, you just you a respond-to-format block. This lets clients using dumb web browsers (and you&#x27;d be surprised how many of <i>those</i> there are) download easily the type of content they want. Accept headers are useful, but they don&#x27;t solve everything.<p>Second, I do agree that auth tokens should go in the header--that&#x27;s just reasonable. If I&#x27;m doing something that needs an auth token, I probably am curl&#x27;ing, and so I can easily set headers.<p>Third, keys are a necessary evil. They are the least annoying way to track access and handle authorization. That said, it shouldn&#x27;t be awful to get a hold of one--in our previous startup, api keys were similar to auth tokens, and that worked out fine.<p>Fourth, web-scraping is not a good solution. &quot;Herf derf just have your dev scrape the thing&quot; is cool and all, but if the document is not marked-up in a friendly way, that information can be very brittle. Moreover, you run the risk of having cosmetic changes break scrapers silently. It&#x27;s far better just to expose a machine-friendly API (which is handy for testing and monitoring <i>anyways</i>) and let your frontend devs do whatever wacky stuff they want in the name of UX.<p>EDIT:<p>I am all for rate-limiting as a basic step where keys do not suffice.<p>As for scraping, the article is a bit weird on this point. The author&#x27;s insistence on &quot;DONT USE APIS EVER RAWR&quot; and then on &quot;hey, let&#x27;s use application/json to provide documents under the same paths for machines&quot; is goofy. It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t want you to use an API, except when they do.<p>The wording and phrasing just really gets in the way of the article--had the tone been a bit less hyperbolic, it would&#x27;ve been a decent &quot;This is why I find web APIs frustrating to work with&quot; with examples.<p>EDIT EDIT:<p>The author is a Semantic Web wonk.

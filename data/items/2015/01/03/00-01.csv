8829419,comment,8828543,8829053,0,0,alexgartrell,,,"It depends how you set up the forwarding.<p>Casually looking at strings /usr/sbin/sshd on my devserver reveals that there is a mode to create a tun device, which sets up a more traditional VPN-ish thing (basically, your computer sees a new interface and routes certain sections of IP space to that prefix.  sshd sucks in these packets and forwards them as is).  This results in two layers of congestion control, which (IIRC -- I&#x27;m not a TCP guy) Congestion Control Algorithms aren&#x27;t set up to handle very well.<p>The more traditional mechanism for tunneling though (the one most often referenced in the posts and things I&#x27;ve seen) is a layer 7 forwarder.  Basically it creates sockets to listen for connections on either ends on a specific port, recv&#x27;s data as a traditional network user, and then turns around and sends the data over the multiplexed transport to the end server.  It essentially strips away the congestion control on the first hop (because you&#x27;re just going to localhost anyway) and there&#x27;s no TCP/IP packets in TCP/IP packets thing going on anymore, just your application stream in their header transport thing.  It&#x27;s less flexible, but is good enough if you want to set up a simple proxy or something and doesn&#x27;t have the same pitfalls.<p>If you need the flexibility, something like OpenVPN might be good (though I haven&#x27;t used it myself).<p>And you might also want to look at stunnel as an ssl tunnel alternative that lets you have more control over what certs go where without archaic and dangerous /etc/ssh/*_config meddling",1420245953

In a given domain of science, the <i>simplest</i> theory (see Occam&#x27;s razor[0]), with the best agreement with available evidence, with the most useful predictions, and with the greatest consensus, might be considered the &quot;accepted&quot; theory of the day.  An accepted theory can be displaced if new evidence does not match predictions made by the theory and the theory cannot adapt to the new evidence, or if a new theory provides better agreement with evidence while being simpler or more predictive.<p>Science as a process transcends human lifetimes.

An investment from IdVC doesn’t preclude you from selling, but in the event you stay independent, our investment will get paid out as distributions from cashflow over time. This is fairly common in most other industries, but we have not seen it applied to technology companies until now.<p>Are distributions required? How are they structured? When do they start? How are distribution amounts determined? Does the founder have a say in any of this? The attractiveness of this program depends a huge deal on the answers to these questions so it&#x27;s kind of surprising that interested parties are asked to apply before any detail about the distribution terms are disclosed.<p>Incidentally, as for the suggestion about novelty, there are a number of revenue based financing companies that are focused on SaaS businesses. They function somewhat similarly but usually without an equity component. The financing company provides the SaaS business with a loan. The amount and repayment terms are tied to the recurring revenue the business generates. Some of these are structured so that they function like a line of credit, and many can be paid off early without penalty.",1420244706

Intonation is the use of pitch to convey additional information regarding emotion or attitude. Tones, on the other hand, are used to differentiate completely different words altogether.<p>For tonal languages, the use of tone as a distinguishing characteristic is similar to any other phonemic characteristic you would typically have to distinguish words in any other non-tonal language. For instance, in English, voicing is a distinguishing characteristic that differentiates the words &quot;pat&quot; and &quot;bat&quot;. Similarly in Mandarin Chinese, tone is a distinguishing characteristic that differentiates the words &quot;mā&quot; (mother) and &quot;mǎ&quot; (horse).",1420243693

The taxis are responsible to replying to your hail, and you are given 120 seconds per request, so if no one replies, your request simply fails. You are supposed to hail when you need the taxi, so there is no time/price tradeoff to be made. There is another service (didi chuanche?) that is higher end and more expensive (they come in nice rental cars) that you can reserve ahead of time, but the government has made it basically illegal (its still going, but they have to be smart about where they drop you off).<p>Note that tipping is not a part of Chinese culture, you aren&#x27;t usually expected to tip. This is more like an incentive for them to come pick you up. I was already tipping 10 kuai anyways before I started using the app, it just felt like the right thing to do.",1420243533

That requires you to take a step back, decide what other variables could cause something, and test for that.<p>But here it's more than some vacuous claim to correlation.<p>Do you get unemployed as a BA first, or do you get your BA?<p>Econometrics is all about identifying causation in correlations in natural data (i.e. you can't run scientific experiments on people's lives, like telling random sample of people to go to college and others to not). Here, you just need intuition to realize that one thing consistently is a prerequisite to another, to realize that it's not just some statistical garbage.<p>There are three possible models to explain the correlation:<p>1. Something influences both one's propensity to get more education (E) and not get laid off (L).<p>2. One's education determines one's propensity to not get laid off<p>3. One's propensity to not get laid off influences one's education. This is nonsense.<p>In a Bayesian network, you can visualize 1. as features f0,...fi (say race, parents' income, etc) influencing both (E) and (L), with (E) also influencing (L) directly. 2. would be a set of features f0,...,fi influencing (E) but not (L), with (E) directly influencing (L).<p>So to conclude, ""This chart only shows correlation"" is a useless comment to make unless accompanied by an analysis of the possible probabilistic models that the evidence supports.",1304872105

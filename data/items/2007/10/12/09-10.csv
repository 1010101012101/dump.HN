I mean, what's next? A TV report about the number of newspaper stories that try to make people worry about things?",1192182524

66773,comment,66649,66745,0,0,shawndrost,,,"I think this article and your comment can coexist under this thesis: the things kids are worrying about are increasingly more bogus.  My personal opinion is that bogus problems have a powerful negative effect on people.  You've lived the life of a street dog and grown up lean and strong, while these kids are living the yappy dog life and growing up neurotic.  (I intend that as a compliment to you.)  They're optomizing for nonexistent variables.  The article touches on this idea:<p>""Researchers found that pupils in schools which tackled the problems they worried about, such as those with eco-clubs and recycling schemes to teach children about environmental problems, were happier.""",1192181921

The nordic countries seem to do things a little better, however, they have some fairly strong reasons to not throw open the borders.  Citizenship in those countries is the most valuable thing a lot of the poorer people own.",1192181456

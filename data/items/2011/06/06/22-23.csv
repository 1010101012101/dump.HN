Since at this point there is little value to showing all the users of the system at once, or highlighting aggregate activity, perhaps it's fine to not include these features, or at least not make them prominent.    So a UI like StumbleUpon might fare better than one like Digg, where the aggregate activity is shown prominently.<p>- Or, pick another MVP with lower critical mass, and then build the community later.  Delicious was great because it was useful if only you are using it, but better with others.  (though still no where as good as it could be.... Chad, i wish you luck!).<p>2) what assets can we use (or create) to acquire users efficiently?<p>Zince we don't have users to work on word of mouth,  you have to have something else.     Some options:<p>- A unique value proposition that will excite someone with influence to give you access to their audience. \n      - a unique product structure\n      - a quid pro quo for the influencer<p>- A ""story""  that will entice a blogger to want to talk about you. \n     -  make it controversial   (e.g. blippy )\n     -  make it human interest  ( e.g.  man sells spot on iPad line  using AirBnB).<p>- A unique marketing opportunity\n     - the greatest ever was when Facebook opened up their platform to intense viral (spammy) promotion.   \n     - You may not find a gold vein that rich... but there are always more opening up.   Perhaps you were early to find a burgeoning high quality community, and built a persona there with influence.... \n     - find a news story and attach yourself to it.   (reputation.com connected with people who had some crazy bad google results, to the degree they could get into the news. )<p>- An asset you have already.  OK, you're probably not PG if you are reading this, but maybe you:\n   -  Know a lot of people in area X  (which is why that is where you should focus your community). \n   -  Have a good story to tell, and can link it to your product\n   -  Know ONE person who has enough influence to help you if your pitch is good.

Apple is adding functionality to the OS that exists as a standalone application out of the OS (this is probaby the main reason why antivirus doesn't ship in the box with Windows).<p>The question MS had to answer was if this functionality was crucial to the operation of the OS.  The TCP/IP stack apparently was deemed so.  IE wasn't deemed crucial.<p>The difference between MS and Apple is that MS had a desktop monopoly.  Apple has no such monopoly in mobile devices.

2627056,comment,2625449,2626932,2,0,raganwald,,,"Groupon is absolutely buying revenues. I read somewhere that $1.00 of revenue costs them $1.43. Given estimates as high as B$4 for 2011 revenues, if investors will value the company at B$15, it is clear that each dollar of revenue is worth $3.75 to investors.<p>Groupon's financing strategy exploits the difference between what an investor will pay for a dollar of revenue--$3.75--and what it costs to earn a dollar of revenue--$1.43.<p>Let's say they have a dollar of revenue in hand. They can sell $3.75 of stock based on that dollar of revenue. At $1.43 per, they can buy $2.62 more revenue. Which they can use to raise $9.82 from investors. Which buys $6.87 in revenues. Which they can use to raise $25.76, and so on and so forth, until they exhaust the market's capacity for buying Groupon stock or everyone tries to cash out at once.<p>Of course, this is not necessarily a bad thing. If a dollar of revenue is actually a dollar of recurring revenue, it could be worth much more than $3.75. It all depends... How much churn do they have? How much competition will they have? It costs $1.43 to get the first dollar of revenue. How much does it cost them to get a second dollar from an existing merchant?<p>I don't know the answer to any of these questions. If it turns out that these revenue dollars are not recurring and the participants in the business know this but are disguising the situation from investors and misleading them into thinking that these dollars are just like regular business revenue dollars...<p>If that were the case, maybe one day people would be on HN claiming that such-and-such a company is a ""Groupon Scheme.""

Let me tell you a story from my own experience:<p>My partner and I created an iPad game for cats. We wanted to get some extra marketing boost so we contacted friskies (purina). In Nov (2010) I exchanged a few emails, and talked to them on the phone about our game. I sent them a video and they told us they loved the idea and they would get back to us. Then one day, silence. We didn't hear anything for months.<p>Then a couple weeks ago they released the Friskies ""Games for Cats"" which are suspiciously similar to our game. The blogosphere exploded. ""Friskies releases creative iPad game for cats"" ""Friskies is oh so clever etc.""<p>We were pissed. But sales improved. A lot.<p>I tried to track their rankings so I searched for them on the AppStore. Hmm, thats odd. I couldn't find them. It turns out /they didn't make native apps/ they were ""simply"" HTML5 pages on their website that you open in browser [1].<p>So what was/is happening is people see ""Friskies iPad Game for Cats"" they grab their iPad and search for ""game for cats"" on the AppStore and then they find our game and we profit.<p>Also, most people who have cats and iPads don't even think to look for a game for their cat. So by Friskies putting marketing into this they actually increase the size of the market (to be honest, I hope they run a TV commercial advertising their ""ipad game for cats"").<p>Moral #1 of the story is: BigCo might steal your idea, but they will likely mess it up and it can end up helping you.<p>Moral #2: high water raises all the boats<p>[1] I realized HTML5 is a ""real"" app, but most normals don't yet view it that way.

Here's the quote as it appeared in the first place that google gave me:<p>>>>\n""He who warned, uh, the British that they weren't gonna be taking away our arms by ringing those bells, and um, making sure as he's riding his horse through town to send those warning shots and bells that we were going to be sure and we were going to be free, and we were going to be armed,""\n<<<<p>Her statement tells us almost nothing.  She might as well have strung some random words together monty-python style, and we'd have been educated to nearly the same degree.  What little is discernible, is simply wrong:<p>* He didn't ever warn the British that they couldn't disarm us.  All accounts of his interrogation have him trying to bluff them away from the town by scaring them with the spectre of a mustered militia.<p>* He certainly didn't warn the British by ""ringing those bells"".  Perhaps Palin thinks that he continued to ring bells while being interrogated.<p>* I don't recall any accounts of his ride that have him firing a musket into the air.  Correct me if I'm wrong.<p>So far this is all rather superficial quibbling.  But if we're to gloss over the petty revisionism and surmise a greater theme or point, Palin is still wrong.  It's pretty clear that Palin wanted to somehow milk the Revere thing for a shoutout to the 2nd amendment.  She wants the <i>purpose</i> of Revere's ride to be to tell the Brits that they can't get our guns.  Perhaps she wants to believe that Paul Revere set out on his ride <i>intending</i> to be captured.<p>Personally, I don't pretend to be greatly offended by Palin's grammar and grasp of historical minutiae.  What does offend me is the way she and her supporters talk in the aftermath.

Look at where they've gone already: music (in a big way); phones (in a big way); eBooks (in a more failed way); heck, they couldn't even leave well enough alone with the iPad, they decided to market directly to the medical profession and compete one-on-one with startups in that field too.<p>I betcha that, somewhere on one of Apple's campuses, there are individuals using Pro/E (or similar), and that makes Steve Jobs grind his teeth at night. And, they've got more money than god at this point; like the Eye of Sauron, all they need to do is move their gaze into another market, and they can compete in it.<p>You're right about the effort required to build a thing, though. I was thinking more along the lines of longtime independent Mac software brands, like Panic.",1307398150

I was almost going to make a similar argument a few days ago, but ultimately decided not to because the masses have effectively redefined what that term means.  At this point, ""Ponzi Scheme"" has become a general term for financial sketchiness.<p>The challenge becomes how to how to denounce the Ponzi term without also denying the presence of financial engineering.  Your argument does this as well as possible IMO.<p>When a pundit claims that Groupon is a Ponzi scheme, he really means ""Groupon is raising money and using the money to buy more revenue at more than face value"".  We don't really have a classification for what this is, and the proposed scheme seems somewhat scam-ish, so the Ponzi term is being used.<p>I'm not claiming that Groupon is simply raising money and buying revenue.  But I do believe that's what the pundits mean to say when they call Groupon a Ponzi scheme.",1307398140

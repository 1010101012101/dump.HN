Universal healthcare is no defence against that, but either is any other form of healthcare.

That house across the street is definitely private property whether it&#x27;s signed that way or not, and I&#x27;m expected to know that because, duh, it&#x27;s a house. At least, that&#x27;s how I understood this:<p>> So the right of the owner of a house to control access to his house is fairly well understood and accepted even in the case where a house might be unlocked or a door left open.<p>Then you discuss the technical and interface features of websites that differentiate them as analogs of houses and streets, respectively, like whether they have access control (locks). But we just agreed that the technical and design features of the door <i>aren&#x27;t</i> what make a house not like the street. The differentiating feature of a house is not the security of its door, or even whether it has one; it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s a house and we&#x27;re expected to know it&#x27;s private. I don&#x27;t get how that difference is analogous to access controls on a website. What&#x27;s the <i>social convention</i> that&#x27;s appropriate for determining whether a piece of information on the internet can be fairly accessed or not?<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t good answers here (e.g. a house has walls which imply privacy, so you need some analog for walls on your site [1]). Or you could argue that the analogy is bogus (e.g. houses and streets just aren&#x27;t like the internet). Or you could even argue that technical safeguards <i>are</i> the analogous social convention to private homes (I don&#x27;t get it, but it&#x27;s noncrazy). Or you could argue those conventions simply haven&#x27;t been established yet, and that we should consider there to be no such thing as unlocked houses on the web.

I mostly recall that he created a definition and then insisted, as you do, that everyone accept it wholesale and hurl into the outer darkness anything that didn&#x27;t fit his square hole.<p>You&#x27;re also fond of trying to create false dichotomy between Science, immaculately conceived, ever perfect, and the process of systematically searching for truth to the limits of our ability to observe reality and compound evidence pro and contra <i>which inevitably varies according to subject matter</i>.

Most often, LinkedIn asks me if they know XYZ and either I know that they know it or I don&#x27;t know--the value I get from that, it helps me to see where my connections are going with their careers.  That&#x27;s helpful to know for a variety of reasons, use your imagination.  Sometimes they go into &quot;skill&quot; areas I never would have expected.  Likewise, if someone hates Java (even if they know it well) they&#x27;re not going to list it as a skill.

It is not that one group has a higher utilisation of the healthcare system and therefore should pay more - the principle is that everyone is guaranteed the same provisions for healthcare, <i>regardless of their risk factors</i>.<p>Personalised medicine contributes nothing to the concept of universal healthcare; <i>except</i> for the noble aim of enabling better treatment of people through understanding individual responses. &#x27;
The idea that someone should be restricted in their level of healthcare utilisation under a universal system is absurd; As is the notion that someone should be forced to contribute extra (apart from the incremental addition of a high income earner through increased taxation) due to a perceived increase in risk.<p>>><i>The faulty assumption behind universal healthcare is that a one-size-fits-all prescription is good for everyone,</i><p>Again, I feel like you are trying to talk about personalised medicine inside of the concept of universal healthcare. Forget about personalised medicine. What the US needs first is access that won&#x27;t bankrupt. 
The fact is we don&#x27;t know enough about personalised medicine to give people different treatments based on genetic characteristics. And we won&#x27;t for years. Sure, you can look at 1 or 2 isolated instances at the moment (ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in Black people for instance) - but none of this matters when it comes to <i>life-saving care</i>, for which the treatment is going to be the same for everyone anyway, unless you happen to have some rare blood disorder in which case racial profiling and blood tests at the time of intervention will dictate management.<p>>> <i>so in a way, it&#x27;s a subsidy for rich white people.</i><p>How so? Because they live longer anyway? Because they are less likely to indulge in the risk factors that result in early mortality? Again, <i>Universal healthcare doesnt discriminate</i>. But since rich black/brown/yellow/white/green people pay a higher proportion of taxes anyway, shouldn&#x27;t your argument here be that Universal healthcare is a tax on rich people?<p>Additionally, just because you are on a high dose of a Statin, in a high risk population, doesn&#x27;t mean you are developing myopathy. CK levels should usually be checked after a month or 2 of Statin therapy in line with followup for new lipid levels, and in the absence of symptoms it can be fairly safely ruled that you aren&#x27;t experiencing a complication of a statin drug.

There are important issues being litigated here that could affect everyone, and I&#x27;d argue they are worth discussing without regard to this particular defendant and the sheer stupidity of his actions.<p>However, I find WP&#x27;s use of Poulson&#x27;s activities as an example of &quot;legitimate&quot; automated HTML retrieval (&quot;scraping&quot;) to be an odd one.  It seems an awkward a comparison to convey what should be a simple point, in my opinion.<p>How about something much more common?  Googlebot.  Imagine if we forbade Google from using automation and from scraping content and placing it in the Google cache.  No more web search.<p>Alas, because of the ad hoc nature of the Web (i.e., there is no unifiying organizational scheme for locating content across all websites as there would be in, say, locating content in a library of books), you cannot access Web content until you first discover it.  In order to discover content, you generally have to search.  In order to create an index and cache of content to search, someone has to scan/crawl/scrape websites.  The later three are activities that are routinely automated.  As such, they will violate many website Terms of Service and may get you banned simply for being &quot;automated&quot;.<p>In fact, to use Google as an example (not picking on them per se, it&#x27;s just that they are a well-known example), crawling Google will &quot;get you banned&quot; from using Google, temporarily.<p>The irony of this has always intrigued me: Google may crawl your servers, but under Google&#x27;s policies, you may not crawl Google&#x27;s servers.<p>If I create an index of your website, at your expense (by aggressively running automated queries against your http server, as Google does, for example), am I obligated to share it with you?<p>In any event, attempts to criminalize automation should raise red flags with anyone who is even slightly tech savvy.",1379988361

I categorised your suggestion that using gender neutral language would be &#x27;daft&#x27; together with his idea that it would be &#x27;boring&#x27;. If you want to, go ahead and explain why these are such different ideas that I should not have done so.<p>The article wasn&#x27;t written in the first person, it was written as instructional and in the second person (I vs you). Writing in the second person is generally an attempt to connect with an audience. Language choices such as using gender neutral pronouns and references can be made to connect more or less with different audiences, and this author rejected them because it wasn&#x27;t worth it to him. I do not like his decision not to bother including me as his targeted audience. If you don&#x27;t like that I don&#x27;t like that, well that is your own inner workings, why does it bother you so much when I want to be included?",1379988140

Every hospital should be required (if they choose to accept Medicare/Medicaid patients) to publish prices in an easily comparable format tied to standard medical codes for every service/procedure they provide, and should be required to charge individuals without insurance no more than the government or other large insurer pays. This would seem pretty simple to implement and would, over time, help keep prices lower simply by making them public and allowing people to compare them.  The information asymmetry in the industry has created a situation where people are powerless to help themselves and make smart choices with regard to getting healthcare, and has led to the creation of another expensive program that we can&#x27;t afford.<p>Sadly, we have a system in which the industries being regulated control the dialog, and they are all too happy to tiptoe past prices and on to who is footing the bill.",1379988070

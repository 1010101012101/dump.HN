3784699,comment,3784326,3784326,3,0,shabble,,,"This is something I've put a lot of thought into over the last couple of years, but I've never gotten around to figuring out an actual model or design.<p>My basic premises are:<p>* hearing aids are commonly moulded to fit the individual, and thus have exceptionally good noise rejection.<p>* They are designed to be worn for long periods of time without discomfort.<p>* The ability to selectively attenuate/amplify certain signals would be very useful.<p>* Being able to pre-process incoming audio would be extremely useful for suppressing transients (say, gunfire, nearby aircraft, roadworks) to protect the user.<p>* A phased microphone array could be used to provide directional selectivity, and to determine and recreate the position of the original source.<p>* You can transparently mix other signals into your normal hearing, such as music, phone calls, games, etc.<p>In terms of tech, there's really 3 things to figure out:<p>1. Can you achieve good isolation (external noise attenuation) whilst providing high quality audio playback?
Ideally the quality would be indistinguishable from not wearing them, but physics might disagree.<p>2. Can you build a relatively compact microphone array with positional discrimination capabilities at or beyond the human ear?<p>3. Can you build a DSP with the necessary discriminator/transient suppression/mixing capabilities within a realistic power/space/heat budget?<p>4. Can you build the whole thing into a per-ear unit or headphone unit, with wireless links to some sort of controller, plus sources for input (e.g. a phone or music player)<p>5. Can you make money out of it? (Given how useful it could be to especially police/military, I'm going to go with 'yes')",1333310296

3784685,comment,3783114,3783114,52,0,michaelochurch,,,"Warning: this is going to get very long and ranty.<p>I worked on Wall Street 2006 to 2008, and I had friends on the Street before that. I went into ""tech"" in 2008, saw the mini-crash and read the Sequoia ScareDoc, and now I'm watching this bubble.<p>Wall Street has a bad reputation, but I've seen far worse ethics and much less professionalism in technology, which is supposed to be above that garbage. On Wall Street, people know what the rules are. They're pretty clear, because the scummiest shit has generally been tried. You front-run your customer, you go to jail. You get a reputation for being unethical, it ruins your career. You defraud people, you get fired for life from the securities industry. You have to take a Series 7, so you have no excuse. Sure, the industry has some slimeballs and some slip through, but not so brazenly, and they at least are supposed to feel bad about it. In technology these days, there are so many people who don't give the square root of a shit about making good software but just want to play the angles. The vast majority of them aren't engineers, those who are tend engineers turning into junior executives by putting their ethics through a fire sale, but none of those fuckers belong here.<p>Google: generally professional and probably ethical macroscopically, but careerist to a fault. Bureaucratically overgrown. Full of horrid legacy systems that are built to flip-- specifically, to be ""interesting"" enough to merit a promotion for the original architect, who then moves on before it goes into maintenance phase and falls to pieces. That's how you get promoted at the big G. Launch and flee, every 18 to 24 months.<p>Startupland: I can name two major ($100M+ valuation) VC-funded companies that have committed major ethical faults in the past 6 months (one wasn't published and won't be, one developed last week and might be in the next 3 weeks). Both of these startups have some of the best, nicest, and most interesting engineers I've ever met... but are run by scumbag executives that would have fit in better with 1980s private equity people than with the (more decent, much more boring) typical Wall Street quant. I've never met a VC and I'm sure they're not all bad, but my theory is that the scumbaggery in so many VC-funded startups has to come from the top. I assume they fund people who are like them, and that would make sense, given that VCs are mostly MBAs, and something like 60 percent of B-school students at top schools cheat in their coursework.<p>Why do I bring this up? Because it's fucking nuts that some unprofessional, vindictive jerk like this guy was just acquired for $200 million. The world is seriously on tilt here. What are we even doing?",1333309817

Put simply, those excess soundwaves ultimately have to go somewhere, and it's a choice between jettisoning them into the environment and annoying people, trying to absorb them in the body of the headphone and losing quality, or trying to produce less of them in the first place, also losing quality.<p>Very cheap headphones leak sound because they are very cheap and their designers and users don't care either way. Expensive, $500+ headphones leak sound because they are meant to be used in a music production context as a substitute for a $1000+ set of speakers, where one doesn't care about leakage.<p>If you are walking around campus, sitting on a train or generally doing anything except sitting in a chair with your eyes closed then it is pointless buying a very very expensive set of headphones because your physical movement and the input from your other senses will influence your perception of the music to an extent greater than the noise floor of the less expensive headphones you could've bought.<p>To be honest, headphones schmedphones.

I used it as my undergrad algorithms book and it is, quite frankly, far too obtuse and hard to understand. At first, I thought it was just me and that other people found the book readable. I eventually realized that the book itself is just bad for autodidacts.<p>Last month (about 5 years after I took the course), I went through to review some stuff that I'd looked at more recently. Specifically, I had worked out Dijkstra's algorithm on my own and finally understood how the heck it actually worked. I then opened CLRS to check their proof. What I saw blew my mind in terms of sheer obfuscation. Despite having a very clear understanding in my head of the core concept behind the algorithm, I read their proof and was just amazed at how little it actually explained about the simple <i>idea</i> that ties the whole thing together. That by itself isn't a huge deal, because some proofs are just hard to follow. What really upset me was that there was practically no surrounding discussion of the <i>intuition</i> behind the algorithm. Behind all the rigor of mathematics lies very simple and powerful <i>ideas</i>. This book did <i>nothing</i> to emphasize those simple ideas. It's a real travesty to be honest :(<p>If you're looking for something more accessible, I've heard that The Algorithm Design Manual[1] by Steve Skiena[2] is better. Whatever you choose, though, please stay away from CLRS.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0387948600/ref=ase_thealgorithmrepo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0387948600/ref=ase_th...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~skiena/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~skiena/</a><p>edit: I just found this review of CLRS on Amazon (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FI8CA368KWGE/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262033844"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FI8CA368KWGE/ref=cm_cr_pr_per...</a>). It's the top comment for this book and sort of gets at the issue:<p><i>With that said, this book falls short in one MAJOR area, explanations. Too often explanations are left out and left as exercises and there are no solutions to the exercises! Or details are replaced by ambiguous statements such as of ""cleary, this works"", or ""it is easy to see that this ..."". I get the concept of learning by doing, really I do, but there should be some kind of solutions so the student can CHECK his/her understanding of the material and sometimes the exercises are not about advanced aspects of a concept, sometimes it is the core material. Even if the solution manual only contained a simple answer without the work. Not only would it help tremendously but the purpose of doing the exercises would be preserved; that is the student getting his/her ""hands dirty"" and working out a problem.<p>For the love everything good and pure in this universe, I really wish writers of mathematical books would stop using statements like ""clearly this works"" or ""it is easy to see"", ""it is obvious"" etc. While that may be true for you and your brilliant circle of colleagues, everything is not always clear and obvious to your readers. Save all of that ambiguity for your research paper.<p>A great book should deliver in two areas; it should challenge and it should inform. The challenge is there, no doubt. However in some ways it fails to inform the reader. The authors should really think about releasing a students solution manual to help students learn better.

Tools do not have any intrinsic value, a tool's value is derived from its application to a problem.<p>It seems as if you are approaching headsets purely as a means of music reproduction. There are many applications of headsets where audio fidelity is not the only/primary concern.

There are three scenarios that can play out:<p>1. Someone opens up this app, looks for girls nearby and pics one from this app. In this case it would stupid for the rapist to go for the girl because her whereabouts are known so the police would know the area where she was abducted and therefore it would be easier to identify the rapist/murderer as they can check nearby security cameras and know where to look around.
The conclusion would be that if the rapist/murderer/whatever was following logic he would avoid people listed in this app.<p>This leads us to the second possible scenario:<p>The rapist/murderer does not follow any logic and just commits his crime based on primitive instincts (ever heard of rapists who have intercourse with sheep and kettle?)
In that case you loose any way because that person strikes at random and thus the chances are not increased because you checked in somewhere.<p>and then there is the final and third scenario:<p>Someone is trying to murder or rape YOU specifically after picking you out from this app. But lets be reasonable the chances of that happening are ABYSMAL because guess what most people don't want to rape you.<p>Also relevant:

There are two vowels that use the letter I forms:<p>/i and I/<p>So the lowercase and uppercase are essentially split into two letters and then a new uppercase and lowercase form is created based on growing or shrinking the originals.  I'm sure it seemed quite the elegant solution in the 1920s when they were working on the latinized Turkish alphabet.<p>The implication of this is that unlike the Dutch case, this affects all text-transform actions (uppercase, lowercase, and capitalize).<p>When we were doing our Turkish localized site I started digging into this, and I was horrified that no browser actually supports proper Turkish capitalization rules.  Firefox in particular had a bug open since 2004 (now finally fixed as well).  Asking around with Turkish web developers I heard of some crazy hacks (custom fonts!), but I got the feeling that Turkish web designers just avoid text-transform.  This was not an option for us as we rely heavily on text-transform in our design (<a href=""http://tr.mubi.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tr.mubi.com</a>).<p>In the end I was able to piece together a surprisingly robust javascript replacement method with some help from Stack Overflow:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/8743095/8376"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/8743095/8376</a>",1333307580

183402,comment,182760,183341,0,0,Tichy,,,"I learn from your response that my comment was written in a too inflammatory way. Sorry for that.<p>It just seemed to me that it was too much biased in favor of Apple. Unless you have insider information, I am not convinced that your theory is right. It is a possible explanation, but on the other hand, Apple has a nice lock in with iPods and iTunes. Do they care about DRM? Maybe: they might be happy that you bought an iPod. But the thing is, once you consider upgrading to a newer, fancier MP3 Player, you better make it another iPod, or you lose your music. So Apple does benefit from DRM. Not saying that is what they want, but it is an alternative theory.<p>Possibly they simply charge higher rates because they can (yay for fanboys). Most consumers by now might associate digital music with iTunes and not even check Amazon for prices.<p>I think Amazon also has the DRM that signs the MP3s with the buyers names, but I am not sure (haven't actually bought any music online yet).",1210172331

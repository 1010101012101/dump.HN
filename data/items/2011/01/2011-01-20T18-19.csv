Why? Because when people have invested time in something, they're strangely more positive about things and more willing to go along with the program (perhaps to get the payoff that's been missing so far, but even if there's none they will rationalise that it was still a good use of time). Might help if you make the advert slightly more interesting/mysterious than usual though.",1295549996

I can see why Apple wants to do it, but wouldn't we think it wrong for Ford to seal their engine compartment with a security key that only Ford dealerships could open, preventing competing mechanics?  Yes, in a frictionless economy consumers would factor this in to their purchase and not buy from Ford.  But in the real world, this is a pretty easily correctable market failure (which can be traced back to the small number of competitors) which governments usually limit through competition laws.",1295549968

Png is best here due to its support for transparency and losslessness, but a poor choice for photographs if bandwidth is any consideration. Gif works as well for graphics, but the limited color range can result in poorer edge smoothing in a trade-off for file size.<p>Also be aware that IE6 doesn't support transparency in pngs without implementing a simple hack first.

So Apple changed their screws, huh? Instead of bitching about it and trying to turn it into an evil conspiracy plot, how about putting those tinkerer/hacking skills to use finding elegant and creative ways around it if it's so important to you?<p>For typical repairs, Apple offers very good warranties and one of the best return/repair services I've ever seen.

There's still nothing (and likely will never be anything) stopping you from taking a hammer to it, drilling out the screws, x-raying it, or whatever. I'm sure Apple doesn't care if you want to see what's inside something you own. What they do care about is people modifying or attempting repairs and then breaking it and then trying to convince Apple it was <i>their</i> fault.

2124590,comment,2123216,2123927,0,0,aamar,,,"Good point; I think this is the right response.  The author is making a good observation, but I'd suggest tweaking the statement of the paradox:<p>""An increase in programmer skill will increase the fraction of programming time spent doing work that he or she hates, using tools and technologies that he or she also hates.""<p>This version reduces the suggestion that the paradox is a definition of a good programmer.  Both my statement and the original accept at face value that programming skill leads to automating more successfully.<p>In my experience, this paradox is frequently, but not always, true depending on the programmer's temperament and situation.  This 2x2 illustrates:<p><pre><code>                |   Automatable   |  Not automatable
 | Pleasurable  |  Game/""Sudoku""  |   Deep problems
 | Unpleasant   |    Busywork     |    Frustration
</code></pre>
An increase in programmer skill means shifting time from column 1 to column 2, while not necessarily keeping it in the same row.  That means a happy decrease of busywork but also the loss of what I think of as Sudoku-work, the technical work that feels sort of fun and pleasant mental exercise, but work that can be easily automated or obviated given a decent language/working-environment.  Sudoku-work is technically productive, in a way, but certainly not optimally valuable.<p>The paradox is based on the theory that Sudoku-work time is lost and turned into frustration time.  But there is a way out, one that seems partially fixable via programmer mindset: deconstruct frustrating work into busywork (and automate it) and deep problems -- the latter including deep technical problems as well as gaining insight into clients/users, design, and so on.<p>edit: minor clarification, punctuation fix",1295547108

2124570,comment,2124285,2124285,0,0,edw519,,,"It's not the question itself with which I have a problem; it's the whole approach.  Let me explain...<p>1. Every programmer I have ever worked with (except for an inept few) knew <i>something</i> that I didn't.  They could show me a piece of their code and say, ""When you do <a>, it causes <b>, the compiler does <c>, the operating system does <d>, which results in <e>.""  To which I think, ""Great.  Who cares.  I would have just done <x> and been done with it.""<p>2. Looking at someone else's code and asking what it does is great: if you have to maintain that code.  Otherwise, who cares?  If I want to build something, I build it with what I know.  What I know may or may not include the best tool in the tool box, but again, who cares?  Something built 90% optimally today always defeats something built 100% optimally tomorrow.<p>3. Describing what some preexisting code does is a good academic exercise, but that's all it is.  In my experience, I have observed zero correlation between programmers who would have done well on this question and those who could build and deploy great stuff quickly.<p>4. For some things, it's absolutely critical to know what goes on under the hood.  For others, it's a waste of time.  Something than improves performance 1000x or improves up time to five nines is the former.  Something that's slick is probably (but not always) the latter.  I think this question is probably the latter.<p>If I have 15 to 30 minutes with someone and want to find out how well they'll be able to build something, I'll have them build something and ask questions about what they just wrote.  I have always learned more about them this way than by looking at 3rd party code.",1295546812

The combination has been amazing.<p>JumpStart provides similar levels of funding as YC or Techstars. They also provided me with three mentors (one lead and two others). This was the first year for JumpStart and it was done on a rolling basis (one company funded per month). A side effect of that was that there was no programming or much interaction between the startups. JumpStart is going to work differently in 2011 and I believe is now part of the TechStars affiliate network.<p>The Nashville Entrepreneur Center has the mission of ""connecting entrepreneurs with critical resources to accelerate business creation and growth."" That is exactly what they have provided for us. There are 6-12 companies at the EC on any given day. There are mentors here regularly available for meetings and advice. The local investment community has started coming by the space regularly and watching and learning about the companies.<p>The combination of JumpStart and the Entrepreneur Center has taken Bizen from conception to a viable startup within the span of about 5 months. We are closing enough funding to operate for a year and are starting to hire.<p>It has been a great experience.",1295546504

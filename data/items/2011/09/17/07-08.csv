Eventually (pretty goddamn scary fast TBH) it started paying off. I got salary increases, advancements, etc... By the time I left the company I was best paid member of the original team (while being the youngest and with least original experience), I also got to enjoy some really cool perks (how many of you were offered a position of ""free electron""?).<p>It was possible to do - not because I worked so hard ( well I did work hard, tbh) - but mostly because my competition set the bar so low. When people think the way you do, it really doesn't take an ""extra mile"", an ""extra step"" will do a lot of the time.<p>Don't get me wrong, I knew that the environment I was in was shitty and hopeless. But I would not let that destroy my odds. And after 5 years I loaded up on network, experience, opportunity.<p>I also managed to save a bunch of money.<p>And my parents are both blue collar people, without connections in high places, but they had some connections in the department of rationality that I am grateful they passed my way.",1316245952

All of them imply that wealth is a function of income and frugality. And whether you believe it or not - self made wealthy people come in various packages: Shrewd and inethical, frugal and hard working, smart and risk-tolerant or any mix of those qualities.<p>Or to put it into a different perspective: Jesse Livermore explained difference between a speculator and an investor on a investor he knew.<p>This said investor went to see two company managers he was either holding stock of or thinking about buying it. Both were happy to present the guest with any information he wanted to see. The difference was that first manager wrote calculations on beautiful (expensive!) embroidered paper, which he would throw into thrash one by one mostly empty.<p>The other manager wrote calculations and numbers onto cut envelope paper. This manager supposedly ordered all the envelopes from the office be brought to him daily and the first thing he did in the morning was to cut all the envelopes into small sheets of paper and have them distributed throughout the office for taking notes.<p>The investor sold all his holdings in first company and increased them in the second. His decision payed off massively. His rationale being that wasteful attitude of the first manager and the frugal attitude of the second manager. Trickle down to the rest of the company. Thus influencing the way business operates.<p>Frugality is all about eliminating waste, tiny bits at a time. And in hierarchy the whole organization takes some of the character of its founder/leader. Thus one could infer that for a long term business success its founders/leaders absolutely must be frugal.",1316244797

And, further, those things you do need you choose because you like them, not because what you think others will like--and thus, think they like you too.<p>However, there's an interesting issue there. Having little income but consuming even less approaches a certain point--a point that is the same point as consuming a lot but yet having even more income.<p>Either way, at this point you consume less than you earn. And this point happens to be the one that calls you to think what is it that you're here, in life, for. The ""what would you do if you had a million dollars question"", but just in reality. You don't need millions; to reach this point you just need more income than you spend.<p>This calling is always there but you really start hearing it louder as soon as you don't have to be so busy merely making a living.

Close, but the languages do have a few differing features.<p>Your main point is a little questionable - sure, there are languages very similar to C# (Nemerle, J#, etc.), but then you've got F#, P# (Prolog), IronScheme, IronPython, IronRuby... I mean, the existence of the DLR itself kinda puts holes in your argument (for some of the above languages).<p>Claiming ""yeah, but the F# team did everything"" is somewhat true (as they did for the first release), but it's not a meaningful complaint. That's going to be the case for virtually any new paradigmatic language being put onto a general-purpose (i.e., procedural, object-oriented) programming framework. The Clojure team had to do everything to make <i>it</i> work on the JVM, too.

Upon consulting the text you are citing, I figured out why: This is the author's summary of Einstein's position on the determinability of quantum systems, and Einstein <i>was</i> wrong, famously wrong. This statement is about how Einstein thought the world worked, not about how the world actually works.<p>This statement you quote has often been called by the jargon name ""hidden variables theory"". You're asking: What are these hidden variables? Well, Einstein could never find them, and later work has shown that this is because they don't exist.

I've developed desktop apps, and building ext js apps isn't far off from that experience anymore. Maybe it would help if we could get the various javascript frameworks to agree on a component spec.<p>Also, performance on the mobile space is a matter of waiting 2 or 3 years. Mobile perf is moving up fast, partly by browser revs and partly by better hardware. People used to say we needed something better than javascript and the dom on the desktop as well, and a few years of moore's law made that discussion irrelevant.

2523833,comment,2523657,2523769,3,0,blatherard,,,"As I understand it, Einstein was arguing that quantum theory was basically incomplete. That it provided a statistical view of unknown, underlying deterministic processes.<p>To say that properties ""have been smoothed away"" means that the particular statistical measures that quantum theory was using were losing the fine-grained detail necessary for understanding particular events. It's not that the ""quantum wave"" is literally smoothing things in the world, but that the theory of the ""quantum wave"" is disregarding particular facts.<p>Imagine that we described human populations without having the ability to observe individual sex characteristics, or individual human interactions. We might say things like ""a human has a 10% chance of splitting into two humans over the course of a 20 year span."" In this case, our statistics ""smooth away"" differences such as sex, and the interactions of specific humans over time, leaving us with a probabilistic statement. We might start reading the apparent non-determinism as a fact of nature, rather than as a problem with our knowledge.",1304780748

If they invested half the effort they've put into ""IDE-time"" static type inference/type checking in Eclipse/IntelliJ (so that programmers can still get the warm fuzzies of auto completion) into building static type inference/checking into the language itself, I think they'd have seen much wider adoption.<p>This is basically what the guy behind groovy++ has done, but, from what I've heard, they basically told him several years ago that they had no interest in taking the language in a static direction.<p>This sucks because, in IMO, 90%+ of the calls in a Groovy program can be statically dispatched just like regular Java. Sure, duck typing is useful in a few places, but those few places shouldn't mean my entire program has to be dynamic.<p>Groovy has an awesome syntax, awesome compile-time AST transformations, etc.--but a dynamic language, in enterprise environments at least, will not be Java.next.

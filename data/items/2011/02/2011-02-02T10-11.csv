That would catch out Carnival. For example, the OECD model tax convention says: <i>Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is located</i> <a href=""http://browse.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/pdfs/browseit/2310081E.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://browse.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/pdfs/browseit/2310081E.P...</a><p>However, the US uses the following in most of its treaties instead: <i>Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation in international traffic of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that State.</i> And, there is no double-taxation treaty between the US and Panama in the first place, only a tax information exchange agreement.",1296642674

MSSQL has a much better query engine when your queries get complex and it uses indexes in a more sophisticated and efficient way. Also on larger databases where the DB-size exceeds the available memory by a factor of 100, you can really forget about MySQL all together while MSSQL will just keep rolling.<p>Also point 3 about MSSQL defaults has been moot at least since SQL Server 2000. While it <i>does</i> create a named constraint in the background, it supports a as minimalistic syntax as MySQL for setting defaults.<p>In fact, this is such a widely used syntax that you almost have to look up the overly declarative one he uses in his example to know that it even exists.<p>Besides that your link does give at least a light overview of the differences when it comes to programming them, so have an upvote.",1296642496

They develop on Windows. When they want things deployed, they might prefer a server-architecture which they already have intimate knowledge of, rather than some Linuxy thing which does have its different set of rough edges.<p><i>IIS -- Seriously? ... IIS maintenance across servers, but do they beat good ol' text config files?</i><p>IIS has since IIS7 had all its configuration in text/XML-files. While .NET on IIS5-6 only allowed you to move some settings from IIS metabase to an actual config-file in the site-root, IIS7 and newer allow pretty much complete configuration of any relevant setting, either trough this file or trough applicationHost.config.<p>Both are text-files. I'm forced to question how long it has been since you messed around with IIS.<p><i>C# -- Mixed feelings</i><p>C# as a language, while (IMO) not complete is still a very powerful, rich and expressive language. It does have its lackings, but you are writing your Windows/IIS hosted websites in <i>.NET code</i> and may as you please use any other .NET language.<p>Personally I'm getting more and more fond of F#, although I admit I haven't used it for web-development yet.<p>While your criticism about lack of direct comparisons is valid, the rest of your post reeks of a anti-Windows sentiment which has little basis in merit and entirely in preference.

This means Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Lua, Clojure. I think Ruby is a good choice because it has a lot of cool concepts built in to the core language that the others lack, and so it can be a foundation for learning many different styles of programming -- it does this, in my opinion, better than Python, and has a nicer syntax than Perl. _why's poignant guide to ruby is a bit outdated but still a pretty awesome and cool introduction.<p><a href=""http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/</a><p>Second, and this might come as a shock, some form of basic assembler. I recommend LC-3 assembler. And the main reason here is that a decent understanding of the memory model is going to help you a <i>lot</i> when it comes to dealing with pointers, complex data structures, or anything, really. You'll probably never write a program longer than 100 lines in LC-3, but the short things you do write will give you a deeper understanding of your code everywhere else.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3</a><p><a href=""http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/lc-3_simulator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072467509/student_vie...</a><p>There may actually be a newer ""learning assembler""-styled language out there, but I am not aware of it.

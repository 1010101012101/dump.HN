At this point, he no longer <i>deserves</i> to be enlightened. If the vulnerability discoverer feels like being nice and sharing this information first or simultaneously, wonderful. But if they botch it or maliciously post it everywhere else in the world, then no hard feelings. If public knowledge, eventually the problem will be fixed.<p>The key motive here is that at no point are third parties bound to regulate their behavior or self-censor. At no point will rudeness and/or publicly disemminating exploit code lead to any sort of criminal liability so long as the targets include Scott, Scott&#x27;s code, and any systems solely under Scott&#x27;s control.<p>Scott carries no legal stick. As a third-party security researcher with no business relationship with Scott, you should be empowered to give Scott as much advance/simultaneous notice as you feel is appropriate. With no requirements.<p>Let me frame it another way: The very act of publishing a security vulnerability benefits two parties: The publisher/vendor/author of the code that contains the vulnerability, and the public. In the case of Scott&#x27;s open source software, the interest that matters most is the public interest. The public should be informed so they can decide whether or not they wish to continue to trust the code quality that Scott produces.<p>So what if Scott&#x27;s servers get rooted and rm&#x27;d? He&#x27;ll wipe them and write better code next time.<p>At no point will Scott impose any restriction on what you decide to do with your ideas that were inspired by reading his work. Even if your mind goes to dark places. All he asks is, just don&#x27;t hurt the public. He&#x27;s not exactly in a position to waive the right for the general public to press charges if you hack into their systems.",1419572995

For newspapers -- an AP article on the New York Times website has the same value as an AP article on any other website. More broadly speaking -- the content is what&#x27;s valuable here, and if you offer the same content, you offer the same value to readers.<p>As the author himself notes:<p>&quot;What colleges do not do, at least on campus, is to make money off course content. As it is, you can easily order all the textbooks you could possibly read on Amazon. You can join discussion groups about them. You sneak into lectures, or find tons of them online. There is simply little value in the course content.&quot;<p>And yet, the vast majority of people are paying for this content, rather than applying the author&#x27;s cost-saving measures. Why? Because there IS little value in the course content. But that&#x27;s NOT what colleges are selling. They&#x27;re selling credentials. In this case, getting the content from Harvard IS different from getting it off a Github repository. Why? Because there&#x27;s a mechanism at Harvard that signals to other people what kind of content you have learned from them. The reason that the analogy to newspapers isn&#x27;t a perfect one is because accreditation solves real problems for consumers of college -- it lets them demonstrate that their credential has value.<p>Paywalls are &quot;bad&quot; because they restrict sharing of content. For news articles, that&#x27;s bad. People want to be able to share articles they find interesting -- on Facebook, on Twitter, on Hacker News and Reddit and via e-mail and so on and so forth. Paywalls reduce the number of people I can discuss content with, and thus reduce the value of an article to me. With credentials, you don&#x27;t have that effect -- a credential is MORE valuable to me the harder it is to obtain, because the credential then gives off a stronger signal that I have demonstrated my worth.<p>Now, MOOCs target a wider audience than the people looking for credentials. But their revenue streams almost all come from credentialing. And so I don&#x27;t think that closing a MOOC has the same effect as putting newspaper content behind a paywall.",1419570823

7166755,comment,7166173,7166173,54,0,procrastitron,,,"I wrote an operating system in a purely functional dialect of Lisp; <a href=""http://losak.sf.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://losak.sf.net</a><p>There are a few things I learned in the process that I think are relevant here:<p>1. Forget garbage collection in the sense of any variant of mark-and-sweep. For an operating system latency is more important than through put, so you really want real time memory management. If you use reference counting, then there is a lazy variant that gives you just that; no pauses due to reclaiming free memory. The downside with reference counting is that it doesn&#x27;t work with cycles in heap-allocated memory, but if your data is all immutable then you can prevent cycles from being created in the first place.<p>2. Treat mutable memory as a form of I/O. Even if you just want to use memory mapped I/O, you will need some way to read and write to (some portion of) memory. Set aside a fixed block of memory (say, for instance, the first 10 MB), and only allow that memory to be read and written in an imperative fashion. Keep the managed heap completely separate from that mutable block, and don&#x27;t allow any direct access to the managed memory.<p>3. You can actually perform preemptive multitasking entirely at compile time (or at program load time for apps not included when you build a binary for your OS). I&#x27;ve done this for both my OS and for Scheme (<a href=""https://github.com/ojarjur/multischeme"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ojarjur/multischeme</a>). It works extremely well and winds up being much faster than using the native primitives usually used for building multitasking support. For more details on exactly how to do it see the link to my Scheme implementation.<p>4. The biggest difficulty the author will hit, and the most likely cause for performance issues, will be in code generation. Since the proposal is for a new bytecode, the author will have to implement their own interpreter and/or JIT compiler for it, and writing an efficient one is an extremely large chunk of work. I&#x27;ve built an operating system and a programming language, and the language is by far the harder project. This is why I went from working on a new OS written in a new language to re-implementing my compile-time multitasking technique for Scheme; it allows me to take advantage of all of the hard work people have done to make compilers for that language which produce fast code.",1391363771

7166732,comment,7164845,7165155,1,0,JOnAgain,,,"There are 2 classes of services on AWS: infrastructure and platform. It&#x27;s important not to confuse them. Infrastructure includes EC2, S3, ELB, and things of that nature. Platform includes Beanstalk, Dynamo, EMR, and things of that nature.<p>In general, Amazon&#x27;s infrastructure offerings are explicitly trying to be commodity, and compete as such. E.g. lower cost, minimal lock in. If you configure servers using chef or other configuration system, and if you wrap all your service calls, it&#x27;s not challenging to move between vendors on the infrastructure level. Check out fog which helps you do just this: <a href=""https://github.com/fog/fog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fog/fog</a><p>Amazon&#x27;s platform offerings are pretty explicitly trying to build lock in -- explicit in that they&#x27;re often free (Beanstalk) and really just trying to sell more infrastructure.<p>Microsoft, and specifically Windows, pursue a platform strategy. Them offering Linux is actually very novel for them, but it&#x27;s still called WINDOWS Azure, and the word &quot;Windows&quot; has traditionally been synonymous with platform lock in. You write a program for Windows, it runs only on Windows, and you have to pay for Windows.<p>I&#x27;m excited for MS to get fully into the infrastructure business, but I see their offerings as reactionary to Amazon. Big corporate, windows-based companies are needing to do things in the cloud, and have been going to Amazon. I see Microsoft as trying to offer services to prevent them from leaving by letting them buy what they need from MS.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine good reasons to actually start on Azure, though. They&#x27;re not a price leader (dropping prices always seems reactionary to AWS price drops), they have limited selection of services (vs. AWS), limited people using them (weaker community support), and always seem clueless about the internet (SSL cert outage, anyone?). Unless you&#x27;re a Windows only developer and can&#x27;t work on Linux, I really don&#x27;t know why I would choose them.<p>PS. Amazon has a startup program you can get in to. When we started on AWS, they gave us $10K in free services. I know $1K is pretty standard, but if you can get validation (investor? incubator?), they&#x27;ll go higher.",1391363292

I see it as an expensive problem, but not impossible.<p>If you have a completely deterministic VM/instruction set, you can recompute any function output from any set of inputs. If you have non-deterministic input (network, input devices, randomness, etc) you can store those inputs to replay at a later time.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s <i>always</i> necessary to store non-derived data. Do you need to save all keystrokes? All mouse moves? All network packets? Probably not. If those network packets just result in displaying a graph on the screen, they can probably be thrown away. Maybe you can throw away the headers and just compute based on the packet data. Or maybe you can simply store the fact that a stream of data that matches a cryptographic hash was received. It depends on what function receives that non-derived data.<p>So I think the difficulty would be designing a system that would isolate derived data and replayable/recomputable/refetchable data, and the processes that compute that data -- and do so with reasonable efficiency. I think this could be done at the process level rather than the instruction set level (though you would have to have a restricted instruction set -- i.e. limited floating-point).",1391362666

And things like IP packets certainly makes sense to represent immutably - anything else is a bit of a lie :) But there is certainly a risk that the trafeoff of immutabulity becomes too costly for an OS..<p>Also, the system language will not be pure, like Haskell. Just immutable values, like Clojure :)",1391360725

So, not living near a top 5 city doesn&#x27;t really have any bearing on the conversation.<p>I agree that long-term contract-to-hire is a reasonable way to go for may employers and employees, particularly folks that already are already contractors, but the premise of &quot;you&#x27;ve got a couple weeks to prove yourself&quot; is a non-starter.  I&#x27;m not going to quit my day job and risk my family&#x27;s financial security for a company that is unwilling to take a similar risk on me.  In an ideal world, it is the best way to evaluate a candidate.  However, if it were practical, it would have already become an industry practice.  The fact that it seems to be rare indicates to me that it does not work very well.<p>As a Systems Engineer, a practice that I would like to see more of (and may try to implement at the company I work for) is a brief troubleshooting exercise with a shared tmux session.

I live in a town where there&#x27;s a lot of biology research, and there are start-up businesses, but they aren&#x27;t formed by kids who skipped college to get rich. Instead, the typical start-up founder could be anywhere from 40 to 60. It takes a long time to learn biology.<p>Another possibility to consider is that math research takes more time now because it resembles more of a search than an inventive process. If proof is computer-aided, for instance, then an Edisonian approach could be applied to finding a proof for a theorem (or at least, finding important steps), resulting in discovery of proofs being a matter of time, even for the most brilliant mathematician.<p>(edited for spelling)",1391360618

Just one example: at a &quot;safe sex&quot; seminar during freshman orientation, the organizer recommended letting your roommate or a friend know where you are going before meeting someone off of Grindr[0], etc. At the time I heard that, I actually thought of making something like this, though I never actually got around to it. I&#x27;m glad that someone has, though.<p>Another example: I haven&#x27;t had to travel by plane since this summer, but my friends have told me to let them know the next time I have to go through security, so they can know that I made it through safely.<p>These are both somewhat niche use cases, sure, but the product is general enough that it can satisfy both (and, I suspect, many others). The concept of a &quot;dead man&#x27;s switch&quot; is certainly not new or obscure.<p>As you can see, the application mimics behaviors that already exist in the real world. So, their challenge will not be finding real-life uses for this application, but rather marketing it in a way that people <i>understand</i> the variety of things that they can use it for.<p>[0] Grindr actually didn&#x27;t exist then - it was probably Cragislist or something.

7166572,comment,7166104,7166104,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"So the thing that&#x27;s interesting to me is that now you can actually diversify your altcoin holdings and while the value of any one coin can go up or down, the market value you are holding can actually be fairly stable. For example, as Dogecoin loses value as a result of this inflation, you will likely be able to switch to a different coin starting with a new blockchain. In fact, I wonder if the solution to all this is some type of &quot;metacoin&quot; that would represent the averaged out value of various coins.<p>For example, I used to mine scrypt-based coins, then have them automatically traded for BTC via <a href=""http://www.middlecoin.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.middlecoin.com/</a>. It&#x27;s an interesting concept as I would not be able to mine BTC directly on any hardware I own, but I can mine a small amount of scrpyt-based coins. Perhaps the idea of holding value the same way can be introduced. Sort of like a mutual fund of coins. And a coin industry index (Standard & Bits?)",1391360488

Analysis can make good estimations of how many coins are lost. The market price will adjust.<p>- Yes, it puts down concerns from people who believe that inflation is necessary, that is true. Whether deflation is bad is another story, and again, the market takes care of it. If value of the currency goes up over time (&quot;encouraging hoarding&quot;), then the reverse also holds true: merchants lower pricing to encourage spending because they&#x27;d rather have bitcoins/litecoins/whatevercoins than the alternatives.<p>- Same as above. The deflationary aspect has been discussed extensively already, so there&#x27;s no need to go much further.

10223412,comment,10221563,10223292,0,0,WorldMaker,,,"I too have a lot of complex feelings about Stack Overflow. I appreciate it as a resource, but I also worry about what it incentivizes and why and how it incentivizes them. Your example is great: why is it that complicated questions with complicated answers you cannot just link to existing, well written how to article. Some of my best resources have come from such links that could only be appended as comments to the question, so they don&#x27;t benefit from as much Rep gain as an answer, nor can they be marked as the &quot;accepted&quot; answer, when often they are the best answer...<p>It&#x27;s a particular concern given they are exploring a &quot;Documentation&quot; site designed for such long form answers and presumably there will be more answers on the main page of the form &quot;see this example of this Documentation page&quot; and it will be interesting to see if some of the Rep systems and moderation policies adjust with that. On the flipside the Documentation site as proposed still encourages people to (re)create content that could exist elsewhere for Rep points and maybe to the detriment of useful community sites or existing documentation sites. Some of that will be wait and see as they move forward into the project, of course.<p>Finally, in a slightly different direction, as a somewhat unsuccessful game designer in a past life, I spent a lot of time thinking about point systems and incentive systems, and it&#x27;s hard not to evaluate Stack Overflow&#x27;s Rep through some of those filters. From those respects, Stack Overflow Rep is not bad, but sometimes <i>concerning</i>, largely in part from a reactionary position on myself that the &quot;gamification&quot; of the world is largely a bad thing, incentivizing in people sometimes the worst OCD tendencies and disincentivizing thoughtfulness or creativity. Stack Overflow Rep is definitely OCD incentivizing.<p>I had interviewers ask me about my Stack Overflow Rep, and for one thing its not hard to find, and for second thing many of my points are actually elsewhere in the Exchange network, which can be fun to explain. But it&#x27;s also easy for me to worry what in fact they are really asking about if they are interested in such an arbitrary metric, as well known and &quot;extensive&quot; as it may be... (Particularly in a world of employers that forbid social media participation entirely, which would include things like Stack Overflow.)",1442354005

Later a random slide is cherry-picked to support the tenuous argument.  Surprising, considering the level-headed image &quot;Revolution News&quot; is known for.<p>Your second source shows a slide that has a picture of some networking equipment, which the website claims is manufactured by Cisco.  Presumably I could &quot;collaborate&quot; with Whole Foods by buying some mangoes, if I use your definition of &quot;collaborate&quot;.<p>Please use factual premises to support your assertions.  Some HN commenters actually critically review sources!  I&#x27;m not claiming that no malicious collaboration exists, just that there&#x27;s no evidence.",1442350913

Some things I&#x27;d love to do if I had the time:<p>* Improve my culinary skills. Some recipes require all day to do &quot;right&quot;, and I need to take short-cuts in order to use the 30 minutes - 1 hour I have per day.<p>* Recreational programming. Few people who are good at numeric programming also have the free time to just &quot;play&quot;.  Procedural generation, using the latest/greatest visual processing algorithms, automatically integrating real-time data feeds into a &quot;game&quot; of sorts. I hate that I&#x27;m using my creativity to generate excel reports that mostly get consumed by programs.<p>* Music theory.  I&#x27;d love to know more here.<p>* Home improvement / homesteading. It would be great to have to time to make my living space better fit for my preferences.<p>* Volunteering and advocacy. There are a lot of low paying problems in the world that need good motivated minds working on them.<p>* Art projects. I loved art in college, but never had the time to pursue it in my professional life.<p>* Personal Health.  I love to run and open water swim.  Both of these require me to have good weather and be in the right physical state to make use of that weather.  Having more free time maximizes my chance to exercise under optimal conditions.<p>I think it helps that most of these things are things I can do alone and do not necessarily require coordination with other people. The author seems to stress how lonely it is to not have enforced scheduled social time.",1442350843

It is both longer and it also doesn&#x27;t document the fact that the item is semantically a key-value pair.<p>The problem is not (and has never been) whether something is &quot;necessary&quot; or &quot;possible&quot;. Tuple unpacking obviously completely unnecessary to begin with, it has nothing to do with whether this is done in a parameter or not. The problem is whether the code is expressed better via unpacking.",1442350809

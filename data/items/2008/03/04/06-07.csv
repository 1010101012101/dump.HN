A similar quality book that focuses more on introductory material is ""Introduction to Algorithms"" \n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262032937/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204613127&sr=8-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Corme...</a>",1204613228
128664,comment,128627,128627,0,0,tx,,,"There is an interesting idea growing bigger and bigger in recent months.<p>Some say that proliferation of feedback-based recommendation engines and machine learning algorithms for predicting ""what I may like to read next"" is bad for our society, because eventually people will be revolving in their own little narrow worlds of interests, reading/watching/listening same stuff without exposure to anything new, disruptive and mind-stimulating.<p>Many Americans are already largely ignorant of what's going on in the world partly due to CNN+friends that have been doing somewhat similar ""content suggestion"" for years and now the matter will get only worse. People are being enabled to build these ""walls of ignorance"" around themselves.<p>From personal experience, it is especially noticeable with music: if it wasn't for my friends who introduce me to their music, I'd still be listening to the same old stuff (or similar, coming from suggestions on sites like Pandora)",1204613133

If you really mean early advisors it may be more like 0.1-0.25% of common, but again it's a negotiation. They have a good quote from Warren Buffet “make sure that, for the people that count to you, you count to them.”",1204612917

I've built websites and worked with people to build websites, I've installed and worked with linux, helped friends and family with many computer issues, and I've even built an almost-battlebot (never got to compete).<p>At least I'm learning. I think I have the hacker personality, and I undoubtedly have an entrepreneurial side to go with it.<p>Anyways, it's a funny joke.",1204612401

Our ""RFID beverage dispenser"" was mostly PC software driven using a USB rfid reader, solenoid valve and key fob.  Our goal was to sell these to local bars as self service, self monitoring beer dispensers which could have the ability to monitor a persons BAC.  Fun project for sure!",1204611085

They cannot accurately distinguish spiders and robots from human visitors and they do not use fool-proof techniques for counting visits and visitors.<p>Would you use the program that tells you that you've had 1 million users or 100 million users?

(Is anyone surprised?) Levels of entrepreneurial participation are lower in those countries than in the US. And, the schools and textbooks promote economic beliefs that ensure continued suspicion of markets and businesses, and lower entrepreneurial participation, in the future.<p>(US schools don't promote the same attitudes -- at least not until college. :)<p>Ignoring the author's opinion about which way is better, he's identified a real contrast in culture and education which helps explain differences in economic activity.<p>France and Germany are fine places, but would you expect to migrate there to start or join a young high-growth, high-tech business? How about compared to California, Texas, or most other states?",1204610546

1851094,comment,1850374,1850374,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Github has ""won"" in that it's the current darling child of the code-hosting industry. It's done this for two reasons:<p>1. Git is superior to its competitors as a technology for use by developers. It isn't very much superior these days, but it is enough to be noticeable and preferred. This is a superiority in <i>use</i> and <i>performance</i>, which are enough of an edge to offset its architectural failings.<p>2. Github has better UX than the competition: I've been referring to code hosted in bitbucket frequently, and I often sigh at what they're doing. Getting to any given piece of code takes longer and requires more clicks than on Github. Github also has great features for understanding how code is moving within a project, and I find them more comprehensible and useful than the competition's.<p>It doesn't hurt that Github is a small self-started company with a staff full of brilliant people and a talented support staff. They certainly win the <i>personality</i> part of the competition thoroughly.",1288454222

1851086,comment,1849687,1850874,0,0,lambda,,,"No, it is Apple you should be upset at. They're the ones who set up the store which requires everything to be distributed under their EULA, and they're the ones who don't allow you to install any software in any other way.<p>If you take away one of those restrictions, great! If the App Store isn't the only way of getting software onto my own hardware, then they can have whatever policies they want; I can just get the software from elsewhere (see, for instance, Android). Or, if they actually abided by the terms of any free software licenses for software they distributed, well, less fine (I still would like to be able to get my software from elsewhere), but they're at least complying with the terms of those licenses.<p>So yes, it's disappointing that someone clicked ""agree"" to something they couldn't legally agree to, because it violated the terms under which they were distributing free software. But Apple is the one here who is significantly restricting end-user freedom; and the point of this sort of enforcement of the GPL is to get the point across that free software developer will not let Apple benefit from being able to distribute said free software without complying with the terms of the license.<p>Apple benefits from having a better selection of software in the App Store; if I can play my videos on an Android phone, but not an iPhone, that might help me decide in favor of Android. They shouldn't be able to benefit from this without complying with the terms of the license. There are several free software packages (like VLC, GNU Go, and more) that they could benefit from, but should not be able to until they stop restricting end user freedom.<p>I am not trying to get ""my"" rules to trump Apples. I am trying to say that if Apple wants to benefit from my work, then they must play by my rules. I don't use or develop for iPhone for just this reason; because Apple isn't willing to play by a set of rules that I agree with. I have an Android phone; while it isn't perfect in respecting end-user freedom (it doesn't come with root, and rooting it voids your warranty), it is a heck of a lot better (I also use a Mac, for instance, which while much of the software is not free, Apple does not restrict what software I can an cannot run on my own machine, which I consider an acceptable compromise).",1288454093
1851085,comment,1850439,1850541,0,0,kellishaver,,,"Yes and no. Their built-in screen reader and other accessibility tools in OS X are great. The iPad has allowed me to read a book again-which I haven't been able to do in 2 years, unless I was sitting at my desk (can't see printed text). However, you can't, for instance, do some very simple things, like enlarge the text in iTunes, or change the size of the min/max/close buttons in the OS's UI.<p>Many people don't need/want full-screen magnification/zoom all the time, just the ability to enlarge some text and tiny UI components. For things like that, I find linux far more accessible.<p>All of that said, most of my accessibility problems with Apple center around OS X.<p>Though you also can't enlarge text in iTunes/app store on the iPod/iPhone, the iPad has a much more usable 3-finger zoom, as well as a screen reader. The iOS touch interface is, as a whole, very intuitive and easy to use.<p>It is a bit too sensitive in some instances, but also rather forgiving in others.

Very little white space or different background colors to highlight different sections of the site. On one page, you have search boxes, similar jobs, the specific job details, job description. Take a look at some web design sites such as <a href=""http://webcreme.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcreme.com/</a><p>You can get some good ideas from looking at other people's designs.<p>The Google Maps thing is nice, but is it really necessary? I was looking at it from the point of view of someone searching for a job. If I live in Miami and see a job posting for a position in Sarasota, its nice to see the mp but at the same time, I probably already know where Sarasota is in relation to Miami and about how far it is as well. So the question is, is this info useful? Or could the page be enhanced by using this space for something else. Sometimes, less is more and providing too much info to the user can backfire.<p>The Google analytics info can be looked at two ways. Yes, 10% of your users are clicking the map, which is good. But you could also look at it like this, 10% of your users are clicking a link which causes them to leave your site.<p>The date range still doesn't make sense because the field is called Posted Date, which implies one specific date when the job was posted. Most people will know what the current date is, so displaying this info to them is really unnecessary.",1288453944

That said, I have come up with some great ideas while on Modafinil.<p>My best tips if you're going to use this drug is:<p>1) Take a very small dose. 50mg (taken around 8 or 9) is usually more than enough to get me through the day. Occasionally I used to take a 25mg bump in the early afternoon which carried over the hyper feeling into the early evening.<p>2) Try it out on a day when you're by yourself first, so you understand how it changes your perception of the world, because it does alter your perception. You might be quicker to make decisions or react to things, and you need to understand this and compensate for it before you interact with other people. If you can't be alone, at least tell your partner about it so they understand that you might behave slightly differently over that period (possibly more aggressively...).<p>3) The best way to make the most of it, for me, has been to prepare a solid list of big items that I want to get through before I take it, so I don't have to think about what to do next. Modafinil allows you to focus really well on whatever it is you decide to do, but it really doesn't help your executive ability (i.e. deciding what to do). I did once find myself having a really solid, focused, deep, 6-hour session of World of Warcraft. Don't give yourself too much opportunity to wander, or you'll find yourself doing anything that comes to your mind (whether that's reading a book, cleaning the kitchen, reorganising your office, or actually doing some productive work).

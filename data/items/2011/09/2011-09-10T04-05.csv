2980850,comment,2980381,2980381,1,0,penguinbroker,,,"While I agree that the 'Tim Cook' advantage is very important I wouldn't dismiss Steve Jobs' unique abilities so quickly. Yes there are many exceptional designers in the world but to say that was Steve Jobs' biggest influence is wrong. I would even go so far as to say that Ives is the bigger design influence. What I admired about Steve Jobs was his ability to make the right sacrifices. From ditching the floppy drive in the original iMac to refusing to support Flash in the new iOS devices. These sacrifices, while obvious in retrospect were decisions that no other hardware companies were capable of making. While everyone was trying to build what the consumer wanted, Jobs was always focused on what the consumer should want. A huge difference.<p>As Henry Ford once said: If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.<p>While everyone else tries to make faster horses, Jobs has kept Apple focused on building cars of the future. He'll be missed.",1315630627

2980848,comment,2976764,2979735,2,0,sklnd,,,"At least as far as CDMA and WCDMA go, control signalling is shared for all mobiles camped on a cell. In CDMA, while a mobile is just camping there's not a lot of traffic going between the cell and the mobile on the access and reverse access channel. The mobile registers as per the registration settings, and the idles its radio until it is paged by the cell, it originates a call, or the registration settings require it to register again. When idle, there is no signalling going back and forth on the access channel, so that bandwidth can be allocated for other things.<p>I'm not at all familiar with GSM, so I can't say how it works. I expect it's similar, though.",1315630588

I think Steve Jobs could have been successful without Tim Cook, but Tim Cook could not have been successful without Steve Jobs (In turning Apple around). The reason I say this is because Steve Jobs use to do Tim Cook's job when he first returned to Apple. He did it himself, along with his CEO job, until he found Cook. Had it not been Cook he would have found somebody else.<p>Lets not take credit away from Cook though. The guy is good, otherwise Jobs would not have given him the job. But I don't think that we can say that Apple would not be as successful without Cook. However, is almost universally accepted that Apple would not be here without Steve. Hence the Car-Driver analogy >:)",1315630553

Rather, it is preventing from <i>entering</i> the public domain. There is a difference.<p>If you would like to claim they are ""effectively"" the same thing, then why would you choose a term that is different from, and exaggerates, reality? The answer is because you know there is a difference, but know the exaggerated form is more compelling, and you evidently don't have significant qualms with regard to misleading people using overly-sensationalist headlines in serious political matters.<p>You accurately point out that this does not incentivize the creation of the works which have already been created. But the way it incentivizes <i>new works</i> is by showing that copyright is now protected and ensured by the government to a greater extent. Considering the impractically weak enforcement of copyright and subsequent rampant piracy of the Internet age, this can be viewed as compensatory. Those who would make copyrighted material now have more to gain from creating said copyrighted works, and they can also logically anticipate further possible improvements to the law in their favor as a result of this precedent. The article assures us so.<p>But incentive to create works is not the only point of copyright law. Another point is simple justice: that a person who creates something deserves to have it as their intellectual property. Justice still has a place in the legislative decisions of the state, I hope.",1315630162

Big events that <i>cannot be moved</i>. Every day the schedule slips makes it that much more likely you miss the intended product launch window. For Apple, if your product isn't ready to ship, it's not ready to show which means you've wasted a lot of money - your next suitable launch window might be months later by which time the product no longer has a compelling story to tell. Missing the intended launch date can mean the difference between a successful product and a failure.<p>Conference calls are expensive and tend to involve both high-level people and lower-level people. If the schedule is slipping, the chinese engineers won't necessarily tell you the truth about <i>why</i> it's slipping in that sort of forum - there's a face-saving issue. There are also communications difficulties when people who don't speak english well just nod and say ""yes, we'll do that"" without really understanding what they're agreeing to. Email can clarify and puts things in writing but the time difference means most exchanges lose at least a day.<p>Another factor is ""the squeaky wheel gets the grease"". The same factory is trying to build products for you <i>and</i> a variety of other companies. When some other company's product totally unrelated to yours has a crisis, they might choose to rationally pull engineering resources away from <i>your</i> product to serve somebody else...if you're not there to nag and check up on the schedule.<p>The bottom line is that if you don't have at least one person there most of the time, your product stands a very very low chance of meeting your schedule <i>or</i> your quality targets.",1315629814

We don't fastidiously box every block just to make sure everything goes through an object interface, nor do we write 1.+(2) just to make it really clear to everyone that 1 is an object and + is a method. To create accessors, we just call attr_accessor  we don't do AttrAccessor.new(self).<p>The code Steve suggests here would be more idiomatic in Java than in Ruby. That's what this reminds me of  Java's endless array of classes-that-want-to-be-functions. Next somebody's going to realize that you might want to present dictionaries in different ways, so obviously you're going to want a DictionaryPresenterFactory to create a DictionaryPresenter to your specifications (because just having a method with that functionality would not be sufficiently OO, <i>obviously</i>).",1315628342

2980783,comment,2979458,2980723,1,0,psykotic,,,"Yes, Manber derives the linear-time algorithm for the maximal subsum problem exactly like that in his textbook. As you say, if x is involved in a maximal subsum, it must extend the tail's maximal prefix sum, so you return that in addition to the maximal subsum.<p>Regarding recursion vs iteration, Manber generally develops the right induction hypothesis gradually, using informal language (""remove the element and solve the smaller problem"") in the process, and only turns that into a precise algorithm once the final induction hypothesis has been found, so he doesn't present the recursion elimination as a separate step. That works well pedagogically. His main idea is to guide the student's intuitions rather than formally derive a program that's correct by construction the way someone like Richard Bird might have done it. (Bird has an interesting derivation of the maximal subsum algorithm that begins with the brute-force algorithm written as a combinator-based functional program and gradually transforms it in a correctness-preserving way using program calculation techniques until arriving at the fast linear-time program.)",1315627996

Then, while travelling (read: lots of time on my hands), I picked it up again and couldn't put it down until I finished it.  The richness of the world and the pacing of the plot (past page 300 or so) as the mystery is revealed is gripping.  I didn't think it was an earth-shattering book, but it was certainly a great read.  In the same vein, Ender's Game is just another book about a child prodigy/outcast who saves the day.  It seemed far more profound when I was 13 than it did upon re-reading.  Some books aren't revolutionary; they're just a good read.<p>I haven't read Snow Crash or Diamond Age, but I'm about a quarter of the way through Cryptonomicon right now and it's starting to get good.

Quite the opposite. Society functions best when people are very aware that their choices have consequences and when they choose to act in ways that produce good consequences. In fact, individual responsibility is essential to civilization. Society would just fall apart if more than a few percent of people began acting irresponsibly.<p>For example, America has a problem with education. There are a lot of children not learning despite a lot of money being spent. I think a root cause of the problem is students knowing that nothing bad will happen to them if they don't work hard in school. If all the unmotivated students would be put to work for a few weeks in picking crops, with the promise that this will be their lot in life if they don't learn, I suspect the education problem would solve itself quickly.<p>We live in a world where it is possible to be tremendously productive and wealthy.

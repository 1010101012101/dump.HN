However,  checking whether a web site is really functioning isn't something that some trivial app (judging by the $800 price-tag for the entire business) can do. For example, if my web site sells something, it's effectively dead if my payment processor goes offline. However, an app to test this from an externally visible URL would need try to buy something with a credit card before it could figure this out. All the other pages on the site could work perfectly, but the site would be effectively ""down"".<p>One approach would be to have a cron job on my site that pinged the payment processor every few minutes and e-mailed or texted me if it didn't respond, telling me exactly what was wrong.

With that said a cheaper tablet, bigger than the Nexus 7 and smaller than the iPad, would be great. I hope the smaller iPad can fill that niche.<p>Then I go back to the Surface... I'm tempted by the ability to load to apps on the same screen. The keyboard integration looks very slick.<p>Too many choices for me.

4677566,comment,4677050,4677375,1,0,antiterra,,,"In the US, there was Pickett v. Prince [1], wherein Pickett made a guitar out of Prince's symbol and Prince copied the guitar. Both the trial court and the appellate court agreed that Pickett had no copyright because he had no permission to make the derivative work.<p>Pickett's argument was based largely on an interpretation of 17 USC 103(a) [2] that implied he could own the copyright on the portions that were non-infringing, and the court soundly rejected this argument. Internationally the wording is similar:<p>From a translation of the Finnish Copyright Act [4]:<p>""Art. 4.  A person who translates or adapts a work or converts it into some other literary or artistic form shall have copyright in the work in that new form, but his right to dispose of it shall be subject to the copyright in the original work""<p>The Berne convention states: ""(3) Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work shall be protected as original works without prejudice [3] to the copyright in the original work.""<p>I haven't read any Finnish caselaw. However, I expect it to be incredibly rare for a functional legal system to determine the act declares it acceptable to create derivative works sans permission in a manner that inhibits the owner's management of derivative works.

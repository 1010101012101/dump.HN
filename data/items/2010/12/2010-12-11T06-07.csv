Too many users will purchase an app to play for the evening somewhere (while on a trip, for example) and just refund the next morning.  It's unfair to the developers.  15 minutes is ample time to determine if the app is something you want to keep or not.

Really, lisp, Haskell, scala, F#, and others could do that too.<p>Regarding abandoned projects and such: raw talent is great, but it's not nearly as important as drive, determination, and tenacity.  I think it was michaeangelo who said: people rave about my talent, but if they saw how hard I have to work for it, they wouldn't think it so amazing.  This is very true.  Raw talent and coding excellence is really important.

I was writing text adventures and stuff.  But I remember feeling unsatisfied; I wanted to write a ""real"" game with lots of things moving at the same time in real time, like asteroids.  How do they do it, I wondered, since you can only have the computer do one thing at a time. I reasoned that it would be possible to do, but the only ways i could think of doing it were a ton, a metric ton, months, of work.  So i never really got into serious game development until much later.<p>What I didn't realize then was that yes, it really is a ton of work to write the magical software that the Professionals write.  And that's their main secret: tons and tons of really hard work.  Either in figuring out how to make it easy, or in just gutting it out long after it's not so fun anymore, or both.",1292048905

If the guy asking is just wanting to make something, I think RoR is a better material, cept it can't do some things. I think Django is a less good ""base material"" which many people will make an inferior product, but if you're highly competent, it's softer, less rigid structure allows you to be a better rapid developer rapidly dealing with changes to environment and project spec.<p>I, particularly speaking, happen to be a rapid developer of pretty complex systems.

1) There are plenty of merit-based scholarships. Forget about Florida and think about out-of-state universities. Don't aim very high and get into a Tier 2 University where you will be their super-fab superstar.<p>2) Don't plan on leaving the country or even leaving to do work any time soon. There are full-ride merit-based scholarships and your family just needs to provide you the money for some clothes, some books and an occasional ticket home.<p>You didn't mention options that are breaking the law, but that are likely to have little repercussions for you if you get caught (second hand experiences):<p>1) Do not on any forms circle anything that would indicate you are a non-US citizen.<p>2) If there is a form asking if you are a U.S. resident, circle yes. If this ever becomes an issue you can lie that you thought it was for tax purposes (for which you are a resident).<p>3) Imagine your parents never told you your real story. What are the real world situations in which someone will ask for your birth certificate? There are just a few and one of them is for getting an SSN.<p>4) Play dumb. With a merit-based scholarship you'll buy yourself years more of time. U.S. degrees in Comp. Sci are highly valued overseas and require little to no paperwork to convert into whatever country's accreditation system.<p>5) Talk to immigration lawyers, they usually have good ideas.<p>6) Try to gather information from other illegals. With all the security paranoia it might be harder nowadays, but I bet there is still a somewhat accessible underground that will, for around $15000, be able to procure you an SSN with your name on it. That is all you need, once you have an SSN, you are gold my friend and no one ever needs to know. Don't go for it, but find out if such networks still exist or if everything got so computerized that an SSN is impossible to obtain.<p>7) Talk to more lawyers.<p>8) If there is ever a deportation procedure against you, this can be stalled for a loooong time I think with a case like yours. Be prepared to write lots of correspondence with powers that be. Lawyers are good.<p>9) Accept only under-the-table cash in hands for occasional contracting/coding work. Accept a car or some other good. Sell it later. For cash. You can make enough like this to support yourself while in college.<p>10) Wait until some legislation gets passed admitting the X million of illegals into the country. Number X will grow over years and eventually a generation will be quietly legalized. This will happen sooner or later. A big one happened in the early 1990s. You might spend the next 20 years waiting for this, but if anything like the DREAM act eventually passes, you're gold and welcome to America.<p>Oh and yes, if things are getting desperate, consider forging a Florida birth certificate if your in-state scholarship documentation requires it. My guess is they have nowhere near enough resources to verify these. If the scholarship requires an SSN, you are fux0red.<p>If there are people upset about me posting this stuff, I'd just like to remind that I hope this still adds signal and that the name of this website is Hacker News.",1292047700

That's 9.5% of total US households, which, interpolating, would be all the households with an annual income under US$10600; and many of those (if they have housing at all) presumably have dial-up internet access, and can also go to the public library across town when they need faster access.<p>(An interesting side note is that this means that at least a third of US households under the poverty line already have broadband, and probably closer to half.)<p>So, these guys are hoping to sign up all of those folks, plus a slice off the bottom of the folks just above the poverty line, by falsely claiming to give them internet access when what they're really selling them is a TCP/IP version of basic cable TV, with a limited selection of corporate partners who pay for the privilege and perhaps meet some kind of content standards as well.<p>If they were successful, then ISPs that currently serve the least demanding customers would lose those customers, causing them to drop in profitability or raise their prices, driving more of their least demanding customers into the arms of BoxTop.  This used to be a standard argument about why telephone service had to be a monopoly, and it doesn't hold up in that strong form, but it does tell us that BoxTop's success would mean that real internet access would cost more, taking it out of the reach of some people who can currently afford it.  It just doesn't say how <i>much</i> more.<p>So the real outcome, if BoxTop were successful, would be making internet access less affordable to the poor.<p>I predict that it's not going to work, because not only are people under the poverty line not going to sign up for Netflix, they're not going to use an ISP that doesn't let them click on the links their friends are posting on Facebook, and they're not going to use an ISP that doesn't let them run BitTorrent.  I admit I only know a few people under the poverty line in the US, and they may not be a random sample, so I could easily be wrong about this.",1292047412

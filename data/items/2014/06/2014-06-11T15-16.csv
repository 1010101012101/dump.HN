Linking is a step done during program development on object code by a compiler toolchain program to produce an executable.  DLL loading is a step done by the OS on a user&#x27;s machine at runtime to load an executable.  Most non-developer Windows user machines will not even have a linker installed on the system.",1402502392

I&#x27;ve had them frequently hang up on me just because I am scheduling a pick-up for somewhere on Sixth Street in Austin, despite my not being intoxicated in the least. Not to mention, the times when my reservation seems to just get lost or left with a massive window for wait times. If it can give better service and feedback than the current Hail a Cab app thats pretty big in Austin, the extra commission would be completely worth it. Hopefully, it expands beyond London.",1402502391

7878635,comment,7878052,7878052,48,0,ambler0,,,"I think most people misunderstand the intent of Turing&#x27;s paper in which he describes his eponymous test. I agree with Chomsky&#x27;s reading, which he laid out in &quot;Language & Thought&quot;:<p>&quot;There is a great deal of often heated debate about these matters in the literature of the cognitive sciences, artificial intelligence, and philosophy of mind, but it is hard to see that any serious question has been posed. The question of whether a computer is playing chess, or doing long division, or translating Chinese, is like the question of whether robots can murder or airplanes can fly -- or people; after all, the &quot;flight&quot; of the Olympic long jump champion is only an order of magnitude short of that of the chicken champion (so I&#x27;m told). These are questions of decision, not fact; decision as to whether to adopt a certain metaphoric extension of common usage.<p>There is no answer to the question whether airplanes really fly (though perhaps not space shuttles). Fooling people into mistaking a submarine for a whale doesn&#x27;t show that submarines really swim; nor does it fail to establish the fact. There is no fact, no meaningful question to be answered, as all agree, in this case. The same is true of computer programs, as Turing took pains to make clear in the 1950 paper that is regularly invoked in these discussions. Here he pointed out that the question whether machines think &quot;may be too meaningless to deserve discussion,&quot; being a question of decision, not fact, though he speculated that in 50 years, usage may have &quot;altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted&quot; -- as in the case of airplanes flying (in English, at least), but not submarines swimming. Such alteration of usage amounts to the replacement of one lexical item by another one with somewhat different properties. There is no empirical question as to whether this is the right or wrong decision.<p>In this regard, there has been serious regression since the first cognitive revolution, in my opinion. Superficially, reliance on the Turing test is reminiscent of the Cartesian approach to the existence of other minds. But the comparison is misleading. The Cartesian experiments were something like a litmus test for acidity: they sought to determine whether an object has a certain property, in this case, possession of mind, one aspect of the world. But that is not true of the artificial intelligence debate.<p>Another superficial similarity is the interest in simulation of behavior, again only apparent, I think. As I mentioned earlier, the first cognitive revolution was stimulated by the achievements of automata, much as today, and complex devices were constructed to simulate real objects and their functioning: the digestion of a duck, a flying bird, and so on. But the purpose was not to determine whether machines can digest or fly. Jacques de Vaucanson, the great artificer of the period, was concerned to understand the animate systems he was modeling; he constructed mechanical devices in order to formulate and validate theories of his animate models, not to satisfy some performance criterion.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.chomsky.info/books/prospects01.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chomsky.info/books/prospects01.htm</a>",1402501980

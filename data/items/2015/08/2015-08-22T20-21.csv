It&#x27;s a common complaint of blog operators that some bigger blog copied their stuff and got a higher ranking on Google.<p>Google could check when it saw something, but that won&#x27;t work against fast scrapers. For that, you need trusted timestamps.<p>One solution to this would be to have a few time-stamping services. You send in a string, probably a hash, and it adds a timestamp, signs it, and sends back a signed result. Then provide a WordPress plug-in to use this service, hashing and time-stamping each blog entry, and putting the result in the HTML in some standard way.  (Perhaps <span signed-provenance-timestamp-hash=&quot;xxxxx&quot;> blog entry </span>). A few mutually mistrustful services for that would help; blogs with serious forgery problems could use multiple time-stamping services.<p>Search engines then need to look at timestamps as a rating indicator.

They just hover there every so often until I put it back up.<p>Perhaps the most amusing behavior I&#x27;ve seen from them is when I sit on the porch near their feeder. They&#x27;ll come up and take drinks still, but they&#x27;ll give off little mouse-like squeaks of protest in between each drink. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re saying &quot;I don&#x27;t like you near my feeder, but I&#x27;m thirsty enough, I&#x27;m going to sit here for a few minutes and drink anyways.&quot;<p>The more brave ones will come right up in front of your face, hover and look you in the eye. Like they&#x27;re determining if you&#x27;re a threat or not (or trying to steal their precious sugar water). It happened with my friend once and after realizing my friend wasn&#x27;t a threat to it, the hummingbird proceeded to sit at the feeder and drink with her right next to it. Bit intimidating though to see one right in front of your eyes with their long pointy beaks though (along with that grumpy expression hummingbirds typically give off[1]).<p>When I take their feeder down for cleaning, they also go into a panic, looking all over the porch for where it might have gone. After noticing that, I only take it down after they&#x27;ve gone to sleep in the evening. Even putting up a spare feeder is usually not good enough for them, they seem to have their &quot;favorite spots&quot; and only go to the other ones if they have no other choice. I guess we&#x27;re all creatures of habit sometimes :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://g2.img-dpreview.com/62F9AFC79CB848508C77EDD9C335AE60.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://g2.img-dpreview.com/62F9AFC79CB848508C77EDD9C335AE60....</a>",1440276404

It&#x27;s been working (for sufficiently generous values of “working”) that way with TV and films for a while.<p>Personally, I’d rather see more effective forms of paying directly and not compromise the integrity of the content, but then I’m the guy who still buys box sets of spinning discs to enjoy my favourite shows uninterrupted and legally instead of either watching the ad-ridden ones on TV or pirating them on-line, so I guess I’m probably in a minority these days.<p>Given that we’ve yet to solve the micropayments problem, and even if we did it’s not entirely clear how well it would work, I wonder whether the most promising avenue might be some sort of collective subscription scheme. Smaller (or not) sites could join a collective programme that includes a lot of different sites aimed at similar audiences, there would effectively be a paywall but paid through a single centralised subscription rather than every individual site so much of the time users wouldn’t actually see it, and then some sort of simple marker that indicates you’re a subscriber and gets you in would also let the scheme track which sites were getting the most views and adjust payments in some reasonable way proportionate to value.<p>Some of the most successful on-line business models of recent times, other than ad-based and direct payment, seem to have been the library-style services like Netflix and Spotify, so I could believe this sort of collective subscription scheme could work if anyone had enough resources to get it up to a useful number of publishers and subscribers to be credible quickly enough. It feels like a balance of convenience and commercial viability that might actually work to me.<p>A significant problem might be that the umbrella schemes wind up taking a huge chunk of the revenue for themselves instead of passing it on to the real content providers, since the whole model depends on having a small enough number of schemes to be manageable for customers and that implies a degree of consolidation. Then again, we have a similar problem with big ad networks and with other types of middleman site today, so I’m not sure it would necessarily be any worse and at least very successful sites could still go their own way if they were valuable enough to their users so there would always be some inherent competition for any umbrella scheme.",1440273656

10937003,comment,10935292,10936840,0,0,alephnil,,,"> IMO if you take away mathematics from Science, the only thing left are novel ideas (which you can also find in sci-fi novels).<p>Math is an important part of nearly all scientific fields, but to say that there is nothing left but ideas when the math is taken away is too broad. There are many fields of science that traditionally have been developed without a lot of need for math, like for example biology and earth sciences. These days mathematics is a large part of these fields too, but in some subfields, like in ecology, many researchers use little math even today.",1453283977

You can&#x27;t run DD-WRT on the latter, or at least not last I checked, which is the point I was trying to make (albeit poorly).

(The only advantages are circumstantial -- the most common are probably that the existing code is OO, or that the existing devs are OO, or any devs we can find are OO, or the company is a shop that has always done OO, etc. ).<p>I didn&#x27;t say that all state should be immutable. Sometimes you actually must have mutable state (e.g. in a large scale game engine or scientific app where performance and cache is king, you likely do want to modify in place, which is hard to do with immutable abstractions over the data). The trick is to use as little mutable state as possible for the task at hand.<p>I certainly hope most new statically typed languages will not use mutable by default. Rust is a good example. Rust does most of what OO and FP does well, but does it without actually being either FP or OO in the normal sense.",1453283576

Basically the only valid method I&#x27;d accept is having a large group of people who are non-developers, then train half of them in one paradigm and the other in another. Then have both groups solve the same set of problems.<p>The problem with this experiment is that in order to get useful results is that you need a good group of people that are representative of programmers (i.e. people that don&#x27;t know programming, but can and are willing/able to learn). Say you can find 1000 mechanical engineering students for example. Great. Next they need to be trained. How long does that take? A year or two? Finally they need to solve the problems, which should be <i>large</i> problems. Next the solutions to the problems should be carefully evaluated. I&#x27;d say the experiment if done in academia would be ridiculoulsy expensive and time-consuiming.<p>Numerous studies such as on static vs dynamic typing have used tiny programming experiments done by a small groups of students doing trivial exercises over the course of a day. I&#x27;d say they give little or no insight in how experienced developers handle large problems.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to do it as a natural experiment too. A large company could try giving the same task to a team of OO developers, as it does to a team of FP developers. This has happened and the result is usually that the FP developers do it in half the time with half the bugs and twice the enthusiasm. However -- can we know that the people who ended up being FP developers weren&#x27;t just better developers than the OO devs? I&#x27;d wager that &quot;enthusiasts&quot; are more commonly drawn to FP today, so the base of FP developers is a group that is on average &quot;better&quot; than the OO devs. So while I don&#x27;t doubt that FP is &quot;better&quot; in most scenarios, I also belive the FP group would have done a better job with the OO language as well.",1453283023

I&#x27;ll wager that coming up with novel and interesting solutions to physics like amplituhedron [1] requires a large dose of intuition. It also requires formidable mathematical chops, but not nearly as much as similar methods in string theory and similar require. Basically there&#x27;s a base level of &quot;good mathematics&quot; which helps with physics, after which it&#x27;s handy but not necessary. Sort of like IQ vs income, where greater IQ tends to mean greater income up to IQ&#x27;s of about 120-130.

Sure, I&#x27;ll buy that.  E.g. jumping from C++ to Ruby for a bit was, for many of the projects I worked on, a major productivity boost.<p>But I buy it because it&#x27;s got enough weasel words, and it&#x27;s focused on the languages in practice rather than the actual language attribute.  Because I can think of clear and concrete examples where adding static typing helped:  E.g. using Typescript to add static typing information to existing Javascript.  This massively improved my speed in picking up new APIs via judicious abuse of Intellisense.  And typescript as I&#x27;m using it is doing very little more than just adding static type information - much closer to purely comparing static vs dynamic typing than any combination of languages I can spot on these charts.<p>The article&#x27;s statistics doesn&#x27;t measure the productivity difference of static typing vs dynamic typing - it measures <i>certain statically typed languages</i> vs <i>certain dynamically typed languages</i> (among a million other caveats.)  C++ vs Python?  The biggest difference there isn&#x27;t static vs dynamic - the former is weighed down by some of the most cumbersome explicit type annotation in existence (when explicit type info isn&#x27;t fundamental to static typing at all).  Worse, it has the nastiest grammar causing horrible build times, an absolutely insane dependency system, and a standard so absolutely rife with implementation defined, unspecified, and undefined behavior that it doesn&#x27;t even define the size of it&#x27;s common integer types.  And I&#x27;ve yet to meet a C++ codebase that doesn&#x27;t use it&#x27;s common integer types.<p>The article also dismisses type errors too lightly, IMO.  &quot;Out of 670,000 issues only 3 percent were type errors (errors a static typed language would have caught)&quot;.  But does this include such things as SQL injections, where SQL Data was mistakenly treated as SQL Commands?  While most APIs don&#x27;t leverage the type system to differentiate these in a way that will cause errors (be it at runtime <i>or</i> build time), I do consider this a type error, one that <i>could</i> be caught with type system.  Unfortunately, handling the single vanilla string type you typically get tends to take precedence over creating such a type separation...",1453282810

What so far differentiates paradigms that claim they are immune to those problems (or other problems with similar severity, some of them perhaps unknown as of yet) is that they have never been put to the test on projects of the same magnitude (i.e., same codebase size, same team size, same project lifespan[2]), let alone in enough problem domains, so they haven&#x27;t had a chance to encounter &quot;disaster inducing scenarios&quot;, and therefore haven&#x27;t reported disasters yet. What we have now is paradigms that we know to be problematic -- but also effective to some degree (large or small, depending on your perspective) -- and paradigms that we don&#x27;t know enough about: they could turn out to be more effective, just as effective or even less effective (or they could be any of the three depending on the problem domain).<p>How can we know if we should switch to a different paradigm? Empirical data. So please, academic community and the software industry: go out and collect that data! Theoretical (let along religious) arguments are perhaps a valid starting point, but they are ultimately unhelpful in making a decision. In fact, it has been mathematically proven that they can contribute little to the discussion: the theoretical difficulty in constructing a correct program is the same regardless of the abstractions used[3]; only cognitive effects -- which can only be studied empirically -- could provide arguments in favor of a certain paradigm making it easier <i>for humans</i> to write correct code.<p>[1]: As someone who worked on software written in procedural code before the popularity of OOP, it wasn&#x27;t any better (actually, it was worse).

While dynamic variables are tricky to emulate fully, as long as you have the ability to catch exceptions and closures, a very fair simulation can be made:<p><pre><code>    (function(){\n      var o={};\n      D=function(k){return o[k]}\n      dlet=function(b,f){\n        var r,s={};function oops(){for(var k in s)o[k]=s[k]};\n        for(var k in b)s[k]=o[k],o[k]=b[k];\n        try{r=f()}catch(e){oops();throw e;}; oops();return r;\n      };\n    })();\n</code></pre>\nBesides feature variables that are globally accessible, one useful thing you can do with dynamic variables is set up <i>error handlers</i>. Consider the situation where you are saving a big file to the disk and run out of space. If you:<p><pre><code>    save_stuff(); if(oops)throw &#x27;out of space&#x27;; save_more_stuff();\n</code></pre>\nthen your slow saving operation needs to be retried from the start, however if you use a dynamic variable to look up the handler, you can:<p><pre><code>    save_stuff(); if(oops)D(&#x27;out of space&#x27;)(next); else next();\n    function next(){ save_more_stuff(); }\n</code></pre>\nThe user can then use their fancy multitasking environment to clean up some space, and we can continue our operation. I generally recommend this form of error handling anyway.<p>Another useful thing is for context: Imagine you have a user interface choice between an HTTP response and a command line interface. One way to do this is to have two applications, and another way is DI (dependancy injection: pass the &quot;response&quot; object around), however <i>another</i> way is using dynamic variables:<p><pre><code>    D(&quot;output&quot;)(...);\n</code></pre>\nThis has the benefit of not requiring an extra argument to all of your functions.<p>This happens more than you might think: Many people when confronted with all their dynamic variables put them into some kind of &quot;master object&quot; (current logged in user, output handler, database settings, etc), however dynamic variables<p>When you do this, a lot of features become very easy to set:<p>• Capturing output (simply mock a new &quot;output&quot; var)<p>• Testing logic: dlet({db:test_settings},r)===dlet({db:live_settings},r)<p>• Impersonate users (if the right credentials are available)<p>And so on.",1453281259

10936808,comment,10931469,10933844,0,0,lmm,,,"> Duck typing vastly reduces the amount of code one has to write that does nothing, making the purpose of the code much more clear. The tradeoff is in compilation, not clarity of purpose. The code tends to be more flexible to changes in the underlying data, as it is easier to modify!<p>It&#x27;s much harder to make changes because even something like renaming a field requires major testing. You end up writing much more code that does nothing, because the test coverage you need for everything is much longer than the type annotations that would give you the same level of confidence, and whenever you change anything you have to update all your tests by hand. Hope you get the data model right first time! Look at one of those videos of people refactoring Haskell for what a type system can get you.<p>> A sad example of those defending static typing are the Java programmers. I point out that Java supports duck typing via reflection, even if the syntax is painful. They say they don&#x27;t use reflection, they use Spring. [Head in hands]<p>If Java is what you think of when you think of static typing, I don&#x27;t blame you for hating it. If Java-style typing and duck typing were the only options I&#x27;d use duck typing. But there are much better options out there. When I write Scala, most of the time my code looks exactly the same as what I&#x27;d write in Python.",1453280500

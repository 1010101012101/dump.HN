I have some familiarity with natural language processing and think that generating passable computer poetry is a fairly rudimentary task. Tell your model about meter, tell it about rhyme, learn word associations. Pick a language, give it every line of poetry you can find and hit go. What makes you think you could distinguish computational verse from something written by human hands?<p>See, people always say that the trouble is getting your ML model to have some semantics to what it produces, to produce texts which somehow manage to genuinely correspond to the real world rather than just to the use of language.  With poetry they might say, we don&#x27;t just want something that fits the forms, but something with content, with soul.<p>I say, yes, that&#x27;s all true, and have you ever tried getting a randomly sampled human being to produce prose or poetry with meaningful content and soul?

I&#x27;d be more worried about leaking plumbing.<p>If you bring piece of wood indoors and let it dry, it&#x27;s water content will drop to about ~17%. If you take it outside and hang it somewhere so that it catches rain and then dries, it&#x27;s moisture content will average about ~20% in most places on earth. Wood has evolved to do capillary action. This means it&#x27;s very good at drying, but it&#x27;s also very good at staying wet if there is moisture around.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_action"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_action</a><p>Most wood eating fungi need moisture content of at least 30%. And this has to be long term, wet week doesn&#x27;t do anything. But there is fungus called dry rot, that can cope with 20%. This leaves you practically no buffer, as the indoors natural is 17%. The catch here is that dry rot needs certain minerals to ever start growing. Cement and mortar have these minerals. If you build effective barrier between cement and wood structures and keep the moisture below 30%, you don&#x27;t have to worry about rot ever.<p>Insects are another problem. But it&#x27;s rare that you get insects if you didn&#x27;t get rot first. In those rare occasions, there has been some visible defect in the surface of the wood.

According to Amazon, <i>&quot;EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.&quot;</i> Really, an EC2 instance is just a virtual computer. You can, with the click of a mouse, create a new EC2 instance and load a pre-defined system image onto it. This allows you to, rather quickly, manually increase or decrease the number of EC2 instances based on load. Automatic scaling of EC2 instances can also be done, although it would be provided at a higher layer.<p>However, a more critical factor is whether the architects designed their <i>systems and software</i> to scale effectively when the number of EC2 instances is adjusted. If there is a bottleneck that is not properly addressed by adding EC2 instances, then adding EC2 instances will be pointless.",1450035906

In fact an effectively zero-interest loan is the very <i>bottom</i> end of what should be offered by the government by that line of reasoning, the top end being completely free tuition.<p>Having a student loan with &#x27;real&#x27; interest seems to be a policy drawn from looking at the investment->return (financial and otherwise) of a university education from the perspective of each individual (you want the gains, you shoulder the pain), rather than from the perspective of the society at large (all boats are eventually raised, therefore it&#x27;s advantageous to invest our common resources in this).<p>My impression is that sadly, over the past 50 years in most western countries, this has been the trend for higher-education funding policy. I&#x27;m from the UK, and that is certainly the case there.<p>A side-effect of this focus on the purely personal financial investment aspect of higher education seems to be the newer Peter-Theil style attitude that in fact, university might not be as good an &#x27;investment&#x27; as simply going out on one&#x27;s own as an entrepreneur, once school is over. Whether this is right or wrong for any given individual is not an answerable question, but it seems very sad that this functional, financial aspect of things seems to be treated with more importance than the other benefits of a university education and experience, to the extent that it&#x27;s now more and more being discussed as the primary (the only?) factor in the value equation of the whole endeavour.<p>I find this line of thinking sad both on the level of individual, and society as a whole.

This actually makes sense; if it wants to scan for malware in web pages and file downloads coming from https sites, it has to either do this or mess with the internals of web browsers, and MitM is easier and less likely to cause technical problems.<p>The problem is, making a secure SSL endpoint is really hard; if you aren&#x27;t very very careful in how you distinguish good from bad SSL certificates, then users are vulnerable to having their connections tampered with by things like untrusted Wifi routers. Web browsers put a lot of work into distinguishing good and bad SSL certificates, and Avast&#x27;s MitM interferes with this working correctly. In particular, this article reports that Avast will accept revoked SSL certificates, which is a problem.<p>What ought to happen here, is that Avast (and other AV vendors) should be coordinating with Chrome (and other browser makers) to provide an API for antivirus software to get access and scan, in a way that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the normal SSL authentication machinery. I suspect that browser vendors are hesitant because an API created for that purpose would likely also get hijacked and used by malware and adware.",1450035038

But dig into details and they clearly differ.<p>Origins: one starts out with proprietary developed functionality and with tons of money in a skunkworks project, using a consolidated team of developers mainly within one company through the fs development and stabilization; the other starts with an idea in a research paper (not called btrfs then because it wasn&#x27;t an implementation), slow recruitment that&#x27;d eventually involve dozens of major companies, and is on a split stabilize and feature development track.<p>And then if you go back to look at features (commands in particular) in more detail there are some big differences that may or may not affect specific workflows. e.g. btrfs snapshots are unique and independent file trees, in effect there&#x27;s no distinction between the original and snapshot, both are read-writable, modifying one doesn&#x27;t affect the other, either can be deleted without affecting the other (ZFS has a distinct parent-child relationship between filesystems, clones, snapshots). Growing btrfs volumes by adding then (at some point balancing, which may be optional depending on the utilization and layout) is a lot easier and faster than ZFS. ZFS offers raid7 (3 parity drives), Brfs does not. Btrfs offers online defragmentation, ZFS does not. ZFS is more stable for $reasons. Really even ext4 and XFS are considered more stable still, although I hesitate to say Btrfs is not stable or unstable. I&#x27;d say Btrfs is earning trust, where the others have earned it (with very edge case exceptions, and there simply are more such edge cases for Btrfs still being found and fixed)<p>So they&#x27;re actually quite different.",1450034750

(Not too good an example, I know, because in a cricket or baseball game, the ball and bat would not vary at all, or not vary often, unlike arguments tend to do, on different calls.

Learning isn&#x27;t just meant to be something you do in isolation - there is a community aspect and there are endless things you can with a big data approach.<p>Our goal is to take spaced repetition and this new concept of meta-adaptivity and apply it to the masses, not just the hardcore users. Yeah, it sounds like a fancy vision but we&#x27;re further along than you&#x27;d think. Would love to start a discussion on this and possibly get more manpower on making this a reality.

Private label industrial floor cleaning supplies, major supplier for all of on US state.  Why <i>private label</i>?  Because the basic supplies are from a stable, old industry.  The main issue is the one on one selling of those supplies to actual customers who actually use the supplies.  So, the old industry that makes the supplies to fill some train of railroad tank cars is plenty eager to put the supplies in 55 gallon barrels or just 10 gallon buckets for the selling, with private label, my cousin did.<p>I have a childhood friend whose father taught him about selling.  The father&#x27;s business?  Leading wholesale supplier of beer for about 1/4 of a US state.  The son got an engineering degree, but he found that by far his best career opportunity was to take over the family business and use what his father taught him about selling, e.g., to small grocery stores, bars, restaurants, vendors at sporting events, etc.<p>I have a friend whose father taught him about selling.  The father&#x27;s business?  Killed about 5000 hogs a day, chilled them overnight, cut them into pieces, put the pieces in boxes, put the boxes in 18 wheel refrigerated trucks, drove the trucks from the US Midwest to the US east coast.  The selling?  The father sat in his office in the Midwest with a head set and a spiral bound notebook and did the final selling.  How to teach the son?  For a start, when the son was 16, gave him the keys to a nice car and a credit card and sent him, alone, on a <i>selling</i> trip to each of the customers.  Later the son started a business and was really good at selling.<p>Again, we&#x27;re not talking <i>marketing and sales</i> for some business worth $100 billion but selling for some <i>life style</i>, family business.<p>Is there something to teach that is teachable and valuable?  Darned right.  E.g., in the first case, the son came home and told his dad that he had the order signed but, still, lost it.  Why?  Once he did get the order, trying for good customer relations, he stayed around the customer&#x27;s office for a few minutes making small talk.  Suddenly the guy who signed the order had some second thoughts.  Lesson:  When have the signed order, go away, go away nicely, but definitely go away, essentially ASAP.<p>Another lesson?  When selling, emphasize your really good customer service.  So, for the first order, have something wrong with it, say, some missing parts.  When the customer calls, make a heroic effort, maybe drive all night and get there at start of business the next day, and hand deliver the missing parts with apologies.  It worked.<p>There&#x27;s lots of this stuff.  If the father is really good at such selling, then there&#x27;s lots of stuff he can pass down to his son that will work, well enough to be a big help in having the son have a nice standard of living and, e.g., pay full tuition for his children at some B-school where the professors circumvented the challenges of selling by being professors of marketing and sales at a B-school, and I used to be a B-school prof!",1450033201

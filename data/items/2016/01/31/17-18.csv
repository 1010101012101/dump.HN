There&#x27;s a middle ground which has other benefits depending on your use-case: I/O offloading hardware that also handles SSL. These are often PCI networking cards that handle the packet processing, firewall, IDS, maybe management, SSL/VPN, etc. The host CPU works at a high level where it&#x27;s only interrupted upon significant events or with most work done. The load on an I/O-bound server is so small that cheap, embedded CPU&#x27;s can handle it. A CPU-bound server gets a great boost in performance for not worrying about massive I/O load.<p>So, there&#x27;s still potential with that model. Use host CPU if that&#x27;s all you need, though.

The coal, on the other hand, was equally available in 1200 as well as in 1760.<p>If there will be no more coal (doubtful — at least 600 years of proven reserves exist), humanity will find the replacement.    Energy resources are so cheap that we have to actually restrain ourselves to limit our footprint on the planet (otherwise, nobody would care). Oil is dirty cheap and still actually flows right from the earth in some lucky places. Uranium is so cheap we are happy with ~1% utilisation rate in &quot;classical&quot; nuclear reactors (breeder reactors would allow full utilisation, but they cost more — so why bother if uranium is so darn cheap? With breeders, we have enough uranium for MILLIONS of years with our current energy consumption rates).<p>It is knowledge that must be preserved, but utter destruction of human knowledge is no longer a &quot;boring&quot; apocalypse scenario. It is quite interesting how this can possibly happen, and what can be done to prevent it.",1454261533

Itzak Perlman.  A wonderful violinist and (I don&#x27;t know him at all, this is what I&#x27;ve read) a generous spirit as well.  But aside form a foray into jazz that I thought wasn&#x27;t especially notable, Perlman&#x27;s greatness is more or less as a concert violinist.  Interesting to hear he was rejected from music school, but this seems a very odd example.<p>Why not focus on someone like Stefan Grapelli, who started playing at an older age, asked a busker in the paris metro how to play the violin (who laughed the question)?  Why not look into the careers and lives of musicians who made their mark through creativity rather than virtuosity?  I really like violin, from a lot of angles.  I enjoy the amazing precision of the great classical musicians, but I do find myself even more intrigued by musicians like Steve Wickham (who played with U2 and the water boys, among others).  I do tend to agree with the article that the micromanagement many young classical musicians go through in their quest to play <i>perfectly</i> may indeed vastly reduce the possibility that the musician will be able to put together an interesting track for &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; or collaborate with a rock musician to produce something like Fisherman&#x27;s Blues.

If you ran the math on the average marginal cost to the consumer for atorvastatin (Lipitor), I'd imagine it would be much, much lower. For one thing, the patent has expired and Lipitor now has substitutable generics available. Even before that, consumer co-pay for brand-name drugs is rarely more than $50 (usually much lower), and that gets whittled down further as you can convince your doctor to write a larger prescription.

Anyone here who has been through a contracting company has probably been billed at that rate.<p>The most successful that I've seen has always been one of three things. All of these can be traced back to people I know making over $200k in the software industry.<p>#1) Knowing a niche technology and/or industry, finding a company that needs to staff and going in as a self-employed contractor instead of an employee.<p>I had friends making $200 an hour in 1999 because of this. I'd like to say they were working in Lotus at the time, but I don't really remember.<p>Find a company and say ""I live right down the street, you need X and it is hard to find, you can either have me show up every day or have someone a few thousand miles work on it"" - for some companies it is easily worth the extra $40-$60k to have someone local.<p>#2) Working on a well known technology but having something important on your resume - and still going in as a self-employed contractor.<p>Being able to say that you are a major Spring contributor will open doors. Being able to point to your name on the list of authors of Hibernate opens more doors. It doesn't even matter if all you did was help update the docs. It's just a selling point, and it works.<p>Most enterprise shops will think about it like this; ""Either we hire Bob who did some spring work for x-corp, or we pay an additional 40k and we get Lisa who helped write Spring. If you ask me it's worth it to get Lisa"".<p>#3) Biting the Enterprise Application Architecture Bullet - and going in as a self-employed contractor<p>Can you confidently whiteboard the entire Oracle Enterprise Suite? Can you talk about JMS queues, BI managers, the E-Business Suite and all that, ahem, stuff? There's plenty of companies who have built very complex solutions to simple problems and they need someone that knows how the wiring is supposed to work.<p>...that's the extent of how I've seen it work. All three share the same trait; find a company in need and pitch yourself as a contractor.<p>So I missed the whole advice thing. Here's what I'd say:<p>If all you want to do is make money then get yourself in as a contractor for a specific industry. Let's say that is shipping, or distribution, or something along those lines. The more time you spend doing X work for X industry the more valuable you become. If you can walk into X-Shipping-Corp and you can name-drop things like ""Parcel Size Distribution"" you'll probably be fast-tracked into compensation discussions.<p>To give you a real world example, I did lots of travel software work years ago, just being able to walk in and say ""I worked with Sabre Worldspan and Galileo"" was enough to get me to an offer. Hell, I didn't even need to explain what I knew about them (which wasn't much!).<p>That's really if you just want to make money. It isn't glamorous work, and it pushes you into a very specific bucket, but you will most-likely be well compensated.",1370111564

There are giant assumptions: 1) they wanted to work for an SV company 2) they're not deluding themselves about why they didn't get offered an SV job. A much better source would be to actually ask the SV companies why they didn't hire someone.<p>As someone who has been actively hiring for the last six months, trying to grow our team from 5 to 10, hiring is really damned hard. You'll get a mountain of crappy resumes, and a few really good resumes. Some of the really good resumes will turn out to be really good people, some of them will accept offers somewhere else, and some of the people that initially appeared great will test poorly, or you won't click with them personally, or something else.<p>Aside from technical ability, startups also need to look for a certain personality.  At my own company, we're strongly influenced by the Valve Handbook. We like to hire people that understand the problem on their own and say ""I think this is the most important thing to work on"". Not every STEM major has that capability. We also like to hire generalists, or people who aren't afraid of learning how to do the things that need to get done. Both of these reduce our hiring pool.<p>I know founders of funded SV companies who aren't in the country legally. One in particular has a pHD, published papers, and is quite literally creating jobs. The O visa is a possibility, but it's a ton of paperwork. The H1B is tricky to use for founders, because the visa requires that their ""boss"" be able to fire them. Also, the H1B window is short, and the next opportunity to hire someone on an H1 is something like Fall 2014.<p>I've not given offers to candidates because their visa situation was too risky. As in ""I'm in the country legally today, but I have to go back home for a few weeks, and I may or may not be able to get back in"".<p>Every company I've talked to is in a similar situation, in terms of being desperate for hirable, highly skilled engineers, at any price.",1370110881

You can do this in just a couple years easily. The problem is that (for me at least) the work is not satisfying (or worse) and the culture is terrible. Most people don't last all that long or aren't very happy.<p>The other way I've earned significant compensation is by being hired at a senior level, a VP of Dev or really any very senior technical position. At a company with money, these roles can easily make $200k in base salary, and much more with bonuses/equity.<p>The thing to keep in mind I think is that inflation is a very big factor. Making $120k in 2003 is effectively the same as making $150k in 2013. The numbers keep getting bigger, so $200k salaries really aren't that extravagant.<p>And it doesn't matter how much you make if you don't save. Plenty of $200k earners save less than $100k earners do. Anyone who can save $50k/yr is going to be a <i>very</i> happy camper in the future, and most young people could easily do that on $120k if they wanted to.",1370110410

5805142,comment,5803972,5804577,1,0,deelowe,,,"GPUs yield a higher core density and are more efficient in certain situations. This appears to be where the arms race is in HPC these days. Every cpu maker is trying to be the first to cross the finish line with a general purpose GPU solution these days(with a traditional CPU strapped to it's back to run the os). Rumor has it that nvidia will have an arm platform soon. I'm sure Intel and AMD are afraid of this. They want to have something in the pipeline that is competitive before this happens.<p>The way the market is going these days, consumer devices will soon almost all be based around low power/small footprint solutions(e.g. atom, mobile, arm). Heck, it probably won't be too long before we start seeing some serious SOC solutions(what could a raspberry pi type device do in 2 years with a 4 or 6 core arm at it's core). So, that kills margins on the consumer market more or less. Or, well, at least it becomes a race to the bottom. What's left is enterprise and ""the cloud"", where efficiency and iops still rule. For these companies, CPU speed isn't a bottleneck, it's mostly core and io density. They simply want to run more jobs in a smaller space, not necessarily run the jobs faster. So engineering teams are starting to look very closely at GPUs as a means to get a huge improvement in core density for certain situations at the cost of having to rethink some of the software stack. Putting the GPU on the same die as the CPU makes a lot of sense from this perspective.<p>It'll be interesting to watch. If nvidia does have an arm platform in the works, they may win this race, though intel does have a huge advantage with being able to run multiple foundries at one. Part of me wants to believe that intel is capable of doing much more with their APU solutions, but are simply waiting until the future of the market is clearer. Once that happens, they may be able to beat everyone else simply by timing the market on newer designs(like how intel beat AMD after screwing up with itanium and P4).<p>Note: Having a low power SOC type solution is another side effect of all this, but I don't think that's the primary motivator for Intel's efforts here. Maybe for the atoms, but not this chip.",1370110275

I found it's also voltage tolerant. It's rated at 19v but you can run it at much less (down to 15).<p>EDIT: it does go up to nearly 20 watts, depending, esp if you have the HDMI plugged in. Technically I think you can get more out of a NUC than a mini in terms of raw MIPs. They're PCs, not toys like RPI.",1370109869

And anarchists don't just want to get rid of state: they want to get rid of capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy, heterosexism, and every form of systemic domination. Some see civilisation itself as a form of systemic domination. But most of us recognise that it's probably impossible to change all of that stuff, at least in our lifetimes. Does that make anarchism unrealistic/impossible/idealistic/whatever? Not at all.<p>Because we recognise that there's not going to be a singular moment of history (""the revolution""), after which we'll live in an eternal anarchist utopia, anarchism in practice is about creating new (and/or influencing existing) institutions, communities and social movements towards structures and practices that are resistant to take-over, co-option and sabotage by the interests of power. This maximises their autonomy, which should hopefully allow them to serve their own interests instead of serving the interests of power (where ""power"" can be any form of systemic domination). This is an ongoing (never-ending) and imperfect process in which lessons are constantly being learned and relearned by everyone involved.[1] Anarchism as a theory (or theories) is the cumulative body of knowledge derived from people's (up until now, mostly failed) attempts at creating and sustaining anarchist institutions, communities and social movements.<p>[1]: My original point was that I think there's such a lesson to be learned from the recent actions of Canonical/Ubuntu and that I hope the free software movement learns from this, even if it is generally not explicitly anarchist (though certainly anarchists are for free software (if they're for software at all, that is)).",1370109842

Interested in being part of a friendly, dynamic team in a central Cambridge studio? We want to talk to front or back end developers who are creative, organised and love all things web. Ideally you'll have some or all of the following skills:<p>Knowledge of writing standards-compliant, high-performing HTML5 and CSS web pages. \nExperience of working with popular web libraries. We use Django and jQuery, but you can learn these on the job. \nGood knowledge of at least one programming language. \nWe work primarily in Python and Javascript, but are happy for you to learn these on the job too. \nAn understanding of database programming and design. \nFamiliarity with *nix based operating systems. \nAwareness of popular web APIs, such as Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook. \nMore important than relevant experience is the drive to learn and expand your skill set. If you've got a commitment to excellence and can demonstrate an aptitude for programming then we want to hear from you. In return you'll receive a competitive salary, full training and your own top of the range laptop (we work predominantly on Macs but we can let the odd Windows machine slip through the net!).<p>> What you can expect to work on<p>Expect to work on a wide range of challenging projects. We don't have a cookie cutter approach to the web and push the design and technical envelope on all our work. Recent projects have included: an application that manages, filters and analyses radio spectrum data from a series of nationally-located nodes; a responsive website for a high-end safari and Africa travel company; a large website and online admin system to manage the ever-changing attractions and events for an interactive science centre; and a website/application that tracks, maps and graphs the progress of University spin-out companies. Most of our projects are responsive and we're as committed to the front-end user experience as we are to what's happening under the hood.<p>> How we work<p>As a team we listen, learn, plan, design, build, test and deliver together. Whilst different people are responsible for their own part of a project, we all understand the importance of the chain and support each other to get things done. You'll be expected to manage your own workload and you won't ever have a project manager breathing down your neck. Our process is front-loaded with in-depth research and discovery rounds in which both developers and designers participate. This keeps scope creep to a minimum and deadlines and budgets realistic. We don't subscribe to unnecessary bureacracy and keep things streamlined and agile. You'll get to talk to clients too - we all share the successes and the challenges of a project together.<p>> Learning<p>The web is constantly evolving so we expect you to as well. Experimentation and learning new skills is part of the fabric at Onespacemedia. Need some books or course materials? No problem. Want to try out some new techniques on a test project? No problem. Something you want to tell the world about a technology or trend? Blog about it on the website. We expect our team members to be passionate and knowledgeable about their field of expertise.<p>> Lifestyle<p>Working at Onespacemedia is fun. We do serious work for serious clients but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it. Expect plenty of laughter, music, company lunches, trips to the pub and impromptu ping pong battles. Just ten minutes walk from the station and ten minutes walk from the centre of Cambridge, the office is located just of Mill Road, the cultural heart of Cambridge (and probably the closest thing you can get to a London street outside of the capital). We're surrounded by green spaces, pubs, shops and cafés (including the legendary Hot Numbers). We've even got parking spaces. We operate a flexitime scheme too so those of you who are commuting from out of town don't have to spend four hours a day stuck in a traffic jam to and from work.<p>> How to apply<p>Please send CV, covering note and links to any websites or applications you have created, or been involved with, to jobs@onespacemedia.com. We are open to enquiries from individuals seeking part-time and full-time work.",1370109806

It matches the name you said to whatever pre-recorded read in name you have assigned to a contact.<p>So it's not like it actually understands what you say, more that this input ""pretty much"" matches this pre-recorded file.<p>There's a long way to from there to full, usable voice-recognition.",1222030264

If so, then are you allowed to decide what is 'good' for others? Are they allowed to decide what is 'good' for you?<p>You see what I mean? There is no absolute when it comes to entertainment. There is no good or bad. There is just stuff that entertains, and stuff that does not.",1222029923

He's earned his right. It's just that there is a growing anti-American sentiment in the rest of the world (I see it all the time in Aus) and it would be a step backwards to have someone like Palin being literally a heartbeat away from the top spot, especially with the absolute mess that it appears Bush has made.<p>You guys need a leader, not a pretty face.",1222029076

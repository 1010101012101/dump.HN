At this point everyone has accepted that it is what it is and made up reasons why it's a good thing. ""It filters out the people we wouldn't want here"", which is weird because we all love good design and will argue about proper implementations.<p>Anyhow, I haven't been around for long but it seems like there is one guy running the show that has no interest in updating this website.

Imagine a display that adjusts position manually/mechanically in relation to the head movement, enough to give the latency time to catch up with the underlying movement.  People won't just sit in a chair and spin 360 constantly.  If the physical display could shift the angle of view or the pan/scan of viewable pixels perhaps the rendering could happen a bit slower and catch up when the user stops for a second to focus etc.?<p>You could render a 'latency' buffer past the edges of the panel's physically viewable viewport and then the panel could expose that zone along with head movement while the rendering continues to work on catching up with the actual shift.  When the head comes to a stop for even a handful of milliseconds the display can recenter while the scene is rendered to ""time current"" position.",1356872059

4985521,comment,4985485,4985485,1,0,ericedwardthor,,,"I found one of the comments on the poem very interesting as well. Complicates the humor and the take away from the piece. Children and childrearing has evolved dramatically. Overall I think it has been for the better, though it is always worthwhile to reflect upon our actions and priorities.<p>""Most of the adults I have encountered seem to suffer from an inability to resolve two conflicting impulses: the desire to make a better life for their children and their childrens children (and, often, for all the members of those generations); and a certain sort of frustration arising from the fact that people wont just do what was done before because what was so wrong with that? Its easy to say that people have been surviving for millions of years without this or that modern innovation, and its easy to mock parents who stress about all the new threats science uncovers for us each day, but ease doesnt imply insight. The problem the above essay highlights isnt with innovation or striving to improve our childrens lives but rather with obsessing to excess about things that dont warrant obsession. Thats simple to say but it gets obscured by the humor aimed at the stereotypical alpha parents. If newborn babies cant discern colors outside the gray scale, why not get a high-contrast black-and-white moon if it will help your child learn to see and understand shapes? Or if Baby Mozart might help stimulate your childs brain (or even if its just pleasant for your child to listen to), then why not shell out a couple bucks for a CD (or even less for a downloadable MP3)? And I wouldnt have minded so much if my parents had bought some French flashcards, given how easily children pick up the structure and content of language (I can read the brief bit of French in Nessel and Ratners ditty, but the 5+ years I spent in French classes in middle school, high school and college could have been a little easier if I had been given a head start). What compelled me to write this comment, though, are the subset of things that alpha and (thankfully) many non-alpha parents do that are unequivocally important but that are overlooked because people are too busy laughing and not wanting to look foolish.<p>To start: who wouldnt use a fireplace safety gate with a small child in the house? Or even just with people in the house? (And who the heck put a fireplace in that childs room in the first place? [Just kidding]). The sterilizer is not necessary if youre willing to boil your bottle for the requisite twenty minutes or so. And thats all well and good except that many people dont know that you need to boil things for an extended period to actually disinfect them; if theyre boiled for only five or ten minutes, then you may as well save time and not do anything. And is it really so egregious a transgression to buy organic food, given that babies are considerably more vulnerable to pesticide residue? On a related note, why would you use baby wipes with perfume? The non-scented ones cost the same and dont irritate skin or risk allergic reaction. Though the danger from scented wipes is minimal, another substance mentioned here carries far more risk: phthalate, which is, I will admit, obscure-sounding and little-discussed. But even so, it is harmful and (no surprise) very cheap for companies to use, companies that are more than happy to continue to listen to people mock those who worry about the effects of these substances that are bad enough for full-grown humans, to say nothing of newborn babies. I have never heard of non-slip socks; I dont see a problem with brain-development games; nor do I think that a digital archive is inherently less valuable than a physical archive; I dont know the various doctors mentioned nor what a baby would use a yoga mat for nor do I know what sleep or G & T coaches are; I might be misinterpreting but I think I had a star chart and Im pretty sure I thought it was cool. As a pasty white person, I cant imagine not using sunscreen for my child; and sunhats have been making babies look adorable and ridiculous for at least the last two generations (and who doesnt love a baby in sunglasses?); my au pair was from Denmark but she was still cool and sweet and she and I still stay in touch (thanks to the evils of modern technology); I dont live in a place that requires a HEPA filter but if I did I wouldnt hesitate to get one for my son or daughter (and I wouldnt moan later in their lives about how my parents didnt buy one for me). Im aware that this comment is largely humorless and curmudgeonly, but I think humor like the above has an insidious effect made all the more powerful by the ease with which we all join in the mockery.""",1356871314

At the end of the day, I just love jamming out code, but I don't love it enough to be homeless in SF while I attend a school.<p>You have an impressive background and I admire you. I think it's great that you are building sites for other people. I just looked through your profile as well but I'll refrain from giving any reviews. This is not because I don't think the work is bad, it's because this is already too long for a forum post.<p>In regards to ""setting the bar very hard for yourself:""<p>I really hope you pick of Land Of Lisp again because from what I've read of the sample chapters and of the reviews, that book is quite entertaining and impressive. Maybe I'm used to looking at Lisp and doing mathy puzzles with code, but I'm having a difficult time believing that book is harder than the SAAS class. I think more than anything, grinding your way through something that is very difficult for you is impressive.<p>I also think you should create a site (or some major multi-technology project) from scratch. I'm saying no frameworks, nothing that writes any code for you. Obviously, XAMPP is okay, but I'm saying just you, a blank page, and your computer. There is something truly visceral about working beneath the abstractions, and yeah... creating your own abstractions and building it all by yourself.<p>I don't know what to say to you or anyone in regards to ""set the bar very high,"" but I'll tell you what I've done:<p>Work through SICP. Trust me, saying I did that book gets nods of approvals and raised eyebrows from everyone. This book is very difficult but I managed to do 75% of the problems in the book, and it is well worth the effort. I don't know how many times I found an answer to an exercise then looked up from my computer and just sat their dazed at the concepts they revealed. Yes, these concepts are hidden in the solutions, so if you decide to try it, reading it is simply not good enough.<p>After doing most of SICP, I still wasn't sure how much I had actually learned, and to be honest, I wasn't sure I learned anything ""valuable"" at all. I built a website in Clojure + PostgreSQL to test my knowledge and I was very pleased to see all that I had learned and figured out without ever being exposed to odd concepts, especially routing. It felt really good and this experience taught me that although SICP didn't feel ""real world,"" I learned more from it that I could have ever imagined. This is why I take issue from anyone who says CS education is worthless.<p>Corman's Introduction to Algorithms is on my to do list and the book is in the mail as we speak. I want to do this book in C because it somehow feels fitting to learn about foundations while working in a foundation programming language.<p>I've learned how to do higher-level math like proofs and calculus and I'm currently working through linear algebra.<p>I'm also going to finally dive back into learning CSS and I am going to learn to do it responsive style. Very few people can do it, and I honestly believe this will be cake after the torture I put myself through already.",1356869448

I felt like I almost understood what they are for, and the constructors for the arrow datatype aren't very cryptic, but then it hits the code examples, which has stuff like<p><pre><code>    y <- readFileA ""unicorns.txt"" -< ()
</code></pre>
and it's unlike anything I'm used to. I'd love to find a post that described the utility of arrows as well as his did and then maybe having a middle step where they are used without the arcane symbols, and then finally with the arcane symbols.<p>Your post was very clear (although your code blocks have a tiny font on my computer for some reason). The &&& and >>> combinators make sense, especially with your diagram... but in the fizzbuzz case I don't get why it's preferable to have the arrow over something like<p><pre><code>    fizzbuzz x = combine (three x) (five x)
</code></pre>
Although maybe it's just a case of making it simple to compose functions when there are tens of inputs or something, so the simple case wouldn't really demonstrate anything like that.",1356869061

I know, it's better to work for free than to be cheap. But still, I am in doubt.<p>I have tried something similar, and it did not work out. Not at all. I am a freelancer and I normally work alone, but in this case I was working together with a company. The company was offering a free day of consulting, and I was one of the consultants you could book for free. There was not a single response.<p>Later I read some posts from patio11 about how people will not value your time or service when you work for free, and I think this was exactly the problem in what we tried.<p>Anyway, good luck, maybe this works for you.

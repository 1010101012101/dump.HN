There are extreme cases, quite often though just speaking up resolves it.<p>I have a stutter and I have been in many jobs where I have been the butt of some jokes. I have been overlooked or talked over. People have played 'guess the word' when i get stuck... i could go on.<p>I find in the vast majority of cases a quiet word, a quick bit of education or just straight up shutting someone down makes such problems perminantly go away.<p>There is sexism in the tech industry, i am sure there is some racism and whatever else as well. There will always be people who intentionally or not say something that offends. Your work place experience will depend on how you react to that.<p>My experience of the tech industry has shown that it handles complaints well and deals with issues that arise in a positive way. I think this is what people should focus on.<p>I saw a documentary about a fish market where women should be good wives at home. The few women who worked there were subject to daily sexist remarks. They had a choice. Ignore it or quit... There are far worse places to work than in technology",1350057589

4645585,comment,4644963,4644963,23,0,andymatuschak,,,"It's really worth noting that there are substantial performance ramifications to your choice here, in terms of CPU time for generation, memory usage, I/O, and GPU time for rendering.<p>The resizable image background technique will be the fastest option (provided you don't need to programmatically tweak the appearance). Next would be the full-sized background (which needlessly wastes memory). Then the CG-based approach, which could actually perform better than the full-sized background if you had generated a resizable imagethe technique presented here needlessly wastes memory and CPU time by generating a full-width image. But it will still perform worse in basically all cases than the resizable-image-from-disk technique, so you would only want to do that if the parameters need to be tweaked at runtime.<p>The CAGradientLayer-based approach (as written) is a very poor idea unless you need the animated transitions because it requires extremely expensive off-screen drawing passes due to the masking. If your situation permits you to use ""overdrawn"" masking (as I discussed in WWDC 2012's ""Polishing Your Rotation Animations""), this would actually perform quite wellless memory consumption than all the other options; small rendering cost each frame. See also WWDC 2011's ""Understanding UIKit Rendering"" for more on graphics performance with UIKit.<p>I guess it's also worth noting that the cost of masking CALayers with a borderRadius is much lower in iOS 6 than iOS 5, but don't go nuts: it's still way higher than all these other options.",1350057578

This extends to being afraid to try new tasks, take on new projects, or even just ask for critiques of my code, all of which I know are important in this line of work. Obviously these fears are not solely experienced by women, but I think there are some feedback loops which are particularly likely to lead women into this rut.<p>As an example, after university I discovered that when I'd been struggling alone to do my assignments and assuming all the guys were just finding it easy, all the guys were going round to each other's rooms, hanging out together, discussing work and looking at each other's code. They didn't think to invite me, possibly out of fear that I'd misinterpret it as a date or that I'd ruin the boys' club atmosphere, and I rarely asked them about work for fear of looking like I wasn't up to their level.<p>While it's not quite so obvious in the workplace, there's still some of that going on over lunchbreaks, after work or in impromptu meetings. And once you've been unintentionally out of that loop for so long, it's very hard to feel confident enough to ask people for a quick primer in what they're doing, because you feel like the only one who doesn't already know. Again, not intentional and by no means exclusive to women, but as a woman in a mostly-male workplace you are automatically something of an outsider and that can be hard to shake off, especially when trying to shake it off could get you labelled as ""pushy"", something women are generally socialised not to be.",1350055718

If your UI is almost entirely static, then sure, bundling a buttload of images is fast, easy on your designers, and your engineers won't hate you.<p>But if your UI is of the sort that has highly variable sizing and layouts, then you probably <i>do</i> want to start writing custom draw code that removes you from having to maintain a hundred variants of the same asset in your bundle - say, multi-line gradient buttons. It also allows easier abstraction (say, tinted gradient buttons) without your designer having to painstakingly generate what is essentially the same asset save one feature.<p>Programmatic UIs also make it easier to do related A/B tests - otherwise testing a button's color would involve shipping updates with <i>every</i> candidate in the bundle.<p>Like all things, be judicious and smart - though the trend I'm noticing is that we're moving beyond simple UIs on iOS, and there's increasing demand for the sort of UIs that demand this level of flexibility. The performance of recent iOS devices have also been such huge leaps that the penalty of not using pre-baked images everywhere is minimal in most cases.<p>Custom drawing also has a lot of optimization use - this is a surprising little-known trick for custom UITableViewCells. Compositing is still a very heavy load, avoid having complex view hierarchies for high-performance UI components (a UITableViewCell is high perf in most instances). Consider flattening your views into something that fits into your drawRect call - drawing text directly instead of UILabels, drawing images directly instead of UIImageViews, etc.<p>Also, a surprisingly little known trick is CALayer.shouldRasterize - setting this flag will rasterize everything in that layer and below and cache it. This incurs a heavier hit on redraw, but for objects that do not need to be redrawn often it's worth it - this allows you to have baked-image performance while still doing custom drawing.",1350055301

At the session was a woman who is involved with a startup in the same area, but she didn't seem to have the confidence to run the session, even though her involvement in open source geo is much higher than mine (I just piss around editing maps). Ensuring that our community institutions invite women in is a good step: they don't have to accept the invitation, but many will. And that's good.<p>Another problem some women I know face: social expectations. They have to dress more masculine in order to be taken seriously at real-life gatherings. We as hackers like to say we don't judge people based on their appearances but based on their code. Then at the same time, we like to judge the ""suits"". I know women who have said they have to go home and change out of feminine wear (of all levels of formality) into jeans and a t-shirt in order for the hacker crowd to take them seriously. If a guy turns up to an event in a suit, people will just naturally assume he needs to wear it because he's doing coding in some kind of corporate environment. But if women turn up in a dress, they just get the presumption that they are in sales or PR or something. That's bullshit. (This stems from the geeky hackery idea that dressing nice makes someone untrustworthy. Sorry, no, I've worked with utter assholes who come to work in jeans every day, and I've worked with people who are awesome, ethical and never fuck people over whogasp!wear formal or dressy clothing.)<p>Is there an endemic problem of malicious deliberate sexism? No. That exists in some companies, sure, but I don't think that's the primary problem. Instead, there's lots of little nagging bugs, some of which stem from unconscious attitudes perpetuated by geek culture. The sexism problems such as they are consist of lots of little nagging bugs that taken together exclude women. Unless you are some kind of hardcore misogynist, fixing them will have generally positive side effects for everybody.",1350054394

It looks pretty good and so someone decided that would be 2 on a monospace typewriter.

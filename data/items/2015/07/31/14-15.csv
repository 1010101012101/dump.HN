You can make command-line programs (using node), server programs (node) and even native apps (using react native) using JavaScript. However JavaScript is not a well-designed language and for that reason it is not a good first language. That&#x27;s why things like TypeScript exist and it makes OOP easier among other things. ES6 is a big improvement too. In the long run I think JavaScript will win because it is being improved and has huge momentum, but right now Python is the better first language.",1438354729

If you&#x27;re not there, they walk over to the locker, which explains its operation (though they&#x27;ve been here before and know it already):<p>a)  Type in the room number.<p>b)  Our machine will pick a door to pop open.<p>c)  Place your package over the sensor in the middle of the locker.  Close the door.<p>d)  We&#x27;ll print you a receipt.<p>The user-facing process is pretty simple, too: the control unit has a list of rooms with packages available.  If you&#x27;re on the list, you punch in your room number, hit Go, punch in your PIN (set up for you when you moved in), hit Go, and the appropriate doors pop open.  You remove the package and close the door.<p>This machine costs, my guesstimate, $4k and takes up approximately 15 ~ 20 sq feet of floor space to service an apartment building with ~50 doors.<p>(If you want to search for more information about them, and can read Japanese, the magic word is 宅配ボックス)<p>Another option quite popular here for young salarymen is convenience store delivery, where you tell Amazon &quot;Ship it to the convenience store closest to my house.&quot;  They&#x27;re open 24 hours, take delivery of the parcel whenever it arrives, and hold it for you until it is convenient for you to stop by.  This is free to the customer.  (It costs the convenience store nothing to offer at the margin, and they really, really want to get you in the habit of going to &quot;your&quot; store as opposed to going to one of their <i>numerous</i> competitors located as far as several hundred feet away.)",1438354665

This is somewhat common, especially in smaller companies, where there isn&#x27;t a dedicated shipping clerk or mailroom staff.<p>Another common option is to have someone available to accept the package, have them store it, and give it to you when you are available. This type of service ranges from apartments with staffed rental offices, to mailbox stores, to roommates and housemates, to friendly neighbors.<p>A less-common option is to pay for a large mailbox at a Post Office or 3rd-party mailbox store, and have all packages delivered there. The Post Office won&#x27;t be able to sign for packages from parcel companies, but the 3rd-party mailbox stores usually can - sometimes you have to sign a waiver so they can.<p>Drone delivery is a fun option to consider, but it&#x27;s a regulatory nightmare currently. Items such as licensing, insurance, liability, property damage, personally identifiable information (PII) and privacy, airspace laws, and criminal activity all have to be settled before we can realistically consider an automated delivery.<p>Scheduling deliveries is going to be very expensive, especially during the high (vehicular) traffic times when most people are both at their homes and still awake. There are too many cars on the roads to make this viable, delivering packages during the day is just a lot easier. If more people worked alternate schedules, this problem would be lessened, but alternate schedules impact human health.",1438354211

A lot of the original Amiga engineers spoke. A couple of things stood out that are relevant here. First, the culture of the company was so positive, and what they built was so impactful, that even 30 years later, they considered it the highlight of their careers.<p>Second was that the engineers had offices with doors that closed.<p>As a programmer, I want to build solid, easy-to-use, impactful products that delight people. In order to do that I need to focus, and in order to focus I need long periods free of distraction. It&#x27;s also satisfying to be able to get into a state of flow. I don&#x27;t need that all the time, but I need and want it some of the time.<p>As a (hopefully!) future tech CEO, I want to work with people who want the same. As as Amiga Inc (and many others) have proved, small groups of people with private offices can produce wonderful things and still have a great corporate culture. I also want to make sure I spend my company&#x27;s or my investors&#x27; money wisely and efficiently.<p>(As an aside, the reason that the Amiga had line-drawing built into hardware is because one of the software developers had experience with line-draw algorithms, recognized that it could be easily put into hardware, and convinced the hardware designer to do so. Which I offer as a counter to the people who think that private offices means people won&#x27;t collaborate).<p>Finally, I&#x27;m rather taken aback that the director of a design agency would get onto a public forum and announce that he doesn&#x27;t really care about productivity.

If you took an even bigger chunk of money away from SF, you might succeed in reducing the rate at which real estate prices there are driven upward.  But air-dropping that money in Akron will probably serve only to drive up real estate prices in Akron, which doesn&#x27;t really solve anything (in particular, it does not increase output).<p>The problem here is twofold: first, not enough of the money being created is flowing into operating assets; second, the operating assets being purchased with this money aren&#x27;t productive.  This seems like an obvious and natural consequence of a service economy, in which the dominant inputs are labor and real estate.  When you pay higher wages, that money has to go somewhere.  Some of it goes toward consumption, but most is surplus and gets invested. It has the same problem it had when it was created: it can go toward real estate, operating assets, or portfolio investment.  No one wants operating assets in a service economy (because they&#x27;re not productive), so it ends up in real estate or portfolio investments.  That drives up asset prices but <i>does not increase output</i>.  Diverting more of this money into operating assets (things that make stuff) would increase output and alleviate the pressure on asset prices.  Instead it goes into more wages (paying people more does not make them produce more) and real estate (paying more for land or office space does not make it produce more, either).  One of the few bright spots was oil, but the sharp drop in prices has made investment there unattractive as well, and has reduced nominal output at the same time.<p>The central bankers can control the rate of asset price inflation by making money cheaper or more expensive, but they can&#x27;t do anything to increase output when the money they create is used primarily to acquire nonproductive assets, or to acquire at higher prices assets that are already being fully utilized.  That&#x27;s why real estate is expensive and output is stagnant, and why fiscal transfers won&#x27;t solve anything.<p>Any number of solutions suggest themselves: relaxing regulatory requirements to make manufacturing, utilities, and other non-service industries more productive; fixing China so that surplus cash in the US can be invested in operating assets there instead of domestic real estate; fixing laws that limit the supply of real estate, both to directly reduce the price and to make it less appealing as an investment; investing more tax revenue in infrastructure instead of transfer payments to individuals (where much of it ends up in ... real estate); radical alternatives like breaking up the United States into separate nation-states that are more cohesive internally.  I&#x27;m sure you can think of others as well.",1438353578

And then I saw this: http://prntscr.com/7z800b. Wait a minute, is it a Product Hunt referral? A started to search it on Product Hunt and Google, and couldn’t understand what had happened now. I found KUKU in the Upcoming section. I could not be more upset. My KUKU was published yesterday, had only 9 upvotes and no chances of being featured. I had a great plan to submit KUKU in a few months, when we add new awesome features like new social nets, analytics, smart posts and tags suggestions, etc… Forget :)<p>I was in panic!<p>Two months ago, as a devoted fan of Product Hunt, I’ve decided to organize a Product Hunt meetup in my city. And here is how I’ve got into PHglobal community. I haven’t even had a thought to promote anything or ask for featuring there (well, I am still pretty sure it’s an absolute nonono). It was 10:30am GMT+3, and everyone there were offline, no luck!  I’ve learned tons of information on how to launch on Product Hunt, all the available dos and don’ts. (Jeez, I was like a pregnant women, who is preparing for becoming a mom!) So I’ve made a decision to write the guy, who shared the best launching tips ever, even though he was offline.<p>What happened next was just crazy! He wrote me back that it’s okay, he will feature KUKU today at 7am PST (by the way, KUKU is in featured already: https://www.producthunt.com/tech/kuku-io). Woah! 5 hours to prepare everything: screenshots, emails, posts…<p>So what is the moral? Even if your startup was submitted by someone on Product Hunt, even if you think you have no chances to succeed and being featured, please follow the main rule of Product Hunt:<p>Once a product is submitted – COMMUNICATE! Either on Twitter or Facebook, or anywhere! Communicate and be active!<p><i>And you will be noticed.</i><p>Have an awesome day, and I will go track how the KUKU’s things are going on Product Hunt!",1438353509

(Uncles help ethereum have 12s block times, far shorter than most other cryptocurrencies)<p>The &quot;Average block time&quot; is around 11s which is what you want to see. It is very close to the optimal time of 12s. (Correction: optimal time is now targeted at 15s)<p>The Network Hash Rate of 52.4 GH/s means that maybe 3000 or so computers worldwide have appeared in the last 24 hours to join the network and mine for blocks. (probably many more have joined without mining, but that number cannot be determined from this dashboard)<p>The &quot;difficulty&quot; right now is relatively plateaued, which suggests blocks are traveling efficiently on the network and miners are successfully connecting to the network and not fluctuating too much in number.<p>The transaction graph is flat, because transactions are disabled until the final safety switch on Monday/Tuesday is removed.<p>&quot;Active Nodes&quot; are just the number of nodes linked to the Stats program, so that number doesn&#x27;t mean much.<p>&quot;Gas Price&quot; is, roughly speaking, the cost of an opcode instruction for transactions/contracts, which miners get to decide on for each block they mine (within limits)<p>BOTTOM LINE: These network stats are super boring, and the ethereum launch yesterday was totally uneventful, which is EFFING AWESOME.",1438352634

It also might take a long time to build considering the missing tools which are available to use when targeting the consumer side of the market.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t see any reason why this would not hold in any other computing environment, and tbh I&#x27;d expect it would be even worse. We already have computational power on desktops that would have been unimaginable not that long ago, not to mention GPUs, but look how shoddy the scientific computing ecosystem is (there are exceptions, but in general it&#x27;s &quot;not good&quot;).",1438352045

End of story. You can write crystal clear code in PHP that anyone who started with C (how many I wonder?) or a C inspired language can read. Spreading information and knowledge IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT than debating the language.<p>Let me ask you a question, did you just happen to read that post that was recently on the front page of HN? The one that showed how much awesome is Lisp comparing to Python? How Python&#x27;s creator seems to hate Lisp (functional programming)? Did you read it and got to the conclusion that since (perhaps) you are using a functional language then you are entitled to spew crap like that since you are the holder of truth?<p>Congratulation!

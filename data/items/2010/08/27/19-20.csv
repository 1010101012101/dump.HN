1640036,comment,1639727,1639727,0,0,amoore,,,"You may not notice it, but you have some entrepreneurial and hacker spirit there already. Ever read about projects like TheGlobe.com or people like Robert Tappan Morris and pg? (Go Big Red!) Here is some advice, but I can't tell if you're trying to start a company, or encourage others to, so this is a bit of both.<p>1. Go ask Student Agencies if they need any tech problems solved. I think they run TakeNote, those coupon books, and a bunch of other student-related services. They may have an idea for a student-related service that you can implement and run yourself or eventually sell to them. Since they're sort of a student-run organization, they would be a good way to bring together some problem-solving students and more open to eventually paying you for starting a project for them.<p>2. show up to the cslug or acsu meetings and mailing lists. Ask others what they're working on, or ask them for help or advice on your ideas. Show them that you have a commercially viable project, and they'll start following your lead either by participating with you or by starting their own. Cross-pollinate these groups with the Ithaca Perl Mongers, Ithaca free software group, Ithaca linux users, and whatever other small, niche user groups are around there these days. One activist per year can completely change any of these organizations.<p>3. If you can't consistently steer the meetings for one of those clubs towards the topics you would like to hear more about, start your own. Meet monthly someplace nearby off campus where they serve beer, but you don't have to be 21 to enter. Select someone at each meeting to talk for a few minutes about their idea or project at the next meeting.<p>4. Find the professors who are actually doing things. Sure Tim Teitelbaum's company is pretty academic and different from the general YC startups, but at least he has a company. There are others. Ask him for advice on starting a company in Ithaca. Have a professor speak about starting and running a local company at the meetings discussed in steps 2 and 3.<p>5. I don't know what the ""Center for Advanced Computing"" is like these days, but it used to be that hanging out by the coffee cart in the Theory Center was the best way to meet folks who were actually using computers to solve problems. Go hang out with those guys.<p>6. Sit in on some classes at the Johnson School. Eventually, you'll figure out which of those MBA students actually want to start businesses. Invite them to your meetings, or join theirs. Offer your technical services to any of their pipedream projects. They need you.<p>I'm glad to hear you're interested in this. You can make a large difference just by consistently beating a drum. I'm serious, one dedicated person in a community like that can change a lot. Good luck!",1282939178

Then Jobs went to give Apple's message, and it struck me like as if he actually didn't know at the time.  Compared with ""honor great athletes"" and ""honor great athletics"", the ""we believe people with great passion <i>can</i> change the world for the better"" seemed far too broad and general to be the actual message that people relate to with Apple.<p>I think Apple has actually made themselves several messages: they compare and contrast between the computer geek w/glasses to the normal person (computers for normal people), they target the ""creative"" crowd (cause rainbows and dancing is creative, numbers/math/text is not), and the combination of that brings the ""popular"" thing back to normal people (if you own Apple, you're not a geek, but you're still cool and not stupid).",1282939168

It makes more sense when it's not a portfolio company holding hundreds of patents, though, and when the inventions are genuine breakthroughs: e.g. if a biotech researcher comes up with something that really would improve pharmaceutical research greatly, it seems okay to me if there's a legal mechanism to make pharmaceutical firms pay him licensing fees if they want to use the invention, even if he himself never ramps up into pharmaceutical research. This becomes much more of a minefield if the bar to novelty/nonobviousness is low, though, because then you just get people preemptively ""inventing"" a bunch of things that other people would've found anyway, and then demanding licensing fees.",1282938394

It's clear to many of us that political grandstanding, personal drama, and he-said-she-said do not belong on HN.<p>At the same time, many current and aspiring startup founders have embraced the cultural shift to learning about traditionally non-technical areas such as sales and marketing. And rightfully so; this is after the previous shift (or ""great opening up"") to learning about design and a good user experience.<p>We've done all this because there's no escaping the cold, hard reality that the success of our companies depends on getting the word out and selling people on our ideas. Good code is not enough.<p>The skyrocketing cost of public pensions in California affects the solvency of the state government. When the state government is desperate and must make ends meet, tax hikes are the first and most obvious options, and are always taken into consideration. When you're thinking about starting a company and setting up shop in Silicon Valley, the tax burden is a huge factor to take into account.<p>As things stand today, the benefits of the personal network, concentration of talent, and the established tech ecosystem in Silicon Valley are still more than enough to outweigh the comparatively high tax burden for those who wish to start and operate a successful company.

They tend to produce the best product or service they can, and if they succeed at that, they become really popular.<p>Established large businesses have completely different priorities. Oracle's licensing schemes for one example are not designed for their customers' benefit; they're designed to maximize Oracle's profit, calculated in part by how many customers they can afford to lose.<p>In Backblaze's case, let's look at their business model: $5/month for unlimited storage per computer.

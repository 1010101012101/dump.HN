Don't do it because it seems like the next logical step, don't do it because it brings a partner health benefits, don't do it because either family is pushing you.<p>You can take your time, give the r'ship loads of time to be tested (by travel, financial compromises, living together, sexual compatibility, etc) - if and when you do it, only do it for absolutely the right reasons.<p>It's harder to undo than it is to do.<p>(Personally: Married and divorced before 25. Now engaged to someone after 6-7 years together including living together for much of that, and travelling the world for 12 months.)",1242784600
617957,comment,617475,617475,0,0,dxjones,,,"Although I agree with the main point of this opinion piece (""Reading Aloud"" is a Good Thing), the author comes across as a bit pretentious when he tries to capture the magical ""je ne sais quoi"" about reading aloud, and how young people (students) can't seem to do it right.<p>(1) ""If the work is their own, they are usually trying to read the intention of the writer.""<p>ummm, if it is their own work, then they <i>are</i> the writer. The words express their intention, so reading ""the words"" and reading ""the intention of the writer"" are the same thing.<p>(2) ""It’s as though they’re reading what the words represent rather than the words themselves.""<p>ummm, actually, when I read a story to my niece or nephew I don't just ""read the words"" (if that is all we wanted, we could have a text-to-speech program do it for us).  Instead, I often read what the words represent.<p>""Who goes there?!"" shouted the witch, angrily.<p>""No, no, you're doing it all wrong"", whispered the grey-haired professor, almost inaudibly as he shook his head. ""No young man"", his deep voice admonished loudly, ""Just read the words! Read the damn words.""",1242784577

That's why it is called faith. People who believe in God are going to believe in God, even if you could irrefutably prove beyond any doubt that (a) evolutionary theory is correct and (b) God doesn't exist.<p>You'd still have failed to prove it in their ""heart"", or wherever pure, unadulterated illogicality happens to live.",1242784562

Do you have any references to lotteries run in this manner (and proof that the tickets are not randomly generated)?<p>I think the form of lottery I (and others) are referring to is the one where there are N unique tickets and you have a 1/N chance of matching those N numbers.  Therefore, there is no dependence between different tickets and the likelihood of matching the winning numbers.",1242783937

617949,comment,616905,617518,0,0,brent,,,"I think the most common model is that tickets are randomly generated and winners share the pot.  Two winning tickets do not decrease one's odds from having a winning ticket since they are independent.<p>Clearly it isn't a forest/trees issue, I just thought it was a bizarre addition since under any reasonable assumptions it is incorrect.",1242783563

Are there other modes of communicating the same sentiment? (an epic poem, breaking into heartfelt song, getting tattoos,...) Are they all equivalent?

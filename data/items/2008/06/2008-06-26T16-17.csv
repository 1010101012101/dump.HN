228779,comment,228233,228517,0,0,lolb,,,"""When I use a word, it means exactly what I mean it to mean, no more and no less.""  -- Humpty Dumpty<p>""Intelligence is what intelligence tests measure.""  -- Edward Boring<p>I'm actually surprised by how few comments have been made regarding the actual nature of intelligence in this thread. yummyfajitas' parent comment is one of those few, and he equates intelligence as we understand it with g, the hypothesized general intelligence posited by psychometricians.<p>y.f. makes the same two arguments that psychometricians make for the validity of g as a representation of human intelligence,[1] which are supposed to demonstrate g's ""internal validity"" and ""external validity"". The former refers to the positive correlations between various (supposed) intelligence tests (described in the jargon as the ""positive manifold""), and the latter to the positive correlations between g and supposed success in life. Broadly, the internal validity argument proves the ""general"" in ""general intelligence"", whereas the external validity argument proves the ""intelligence"".<p>The first wrinkle in these arguments is the claim that all human intelligence tests positively correlate with each other to give a universal intelligence factor. This is false; there exist demographics where g is _not_ the predominant factor explaining inter-demographic test score differences.[2]<p>Here is another problem. Psychometricians tend to decide whether some test metric measures intelligence by how well it correlates with existing ""intelligence tests"" that're g-associated. y.f. does this in his comment: ""It is relatively independent of cultural knowledge: i.e., french is nearly independent of g (1), while physics, plumbing and loading irregularly sized boxes into a truck are highly correlated to g"". (I.e., French tests can't be real tests of intelligence, since they don't correlate with g, but physics, plumbing, and bin packing must be, because they do.) But this renders the internal validity argument circular: its two prongs now become: (1) g must exist because intelligence tests correlate positively, and (2) and intelligence tests are those tests that correlate positively with g. The circle closes.<p>The external validity argument supposedly rescues the g concept from this trap, by demonstrating that g correlates vaguely with real-life behaviours. Unfortunately, the correlations are nowhere near perfect, that g correlates with success doesn't suffice to show causality, and pointing out the correlations does not eliminate the underlying circularity in g's definition. All in all, the evidence is inadequate to reject the null hypothesis that there is no causal link between g and life success.<p>[1] Well, I say ""human intelligence"", but if I recall correctly, at least one psychometrician even tried to argue that g might well be a cross-species phenomenon!<p>[2] Dolan, C.V.

Landing page is a simple form and the first form field implores you to enter a domain name. As you start typing you see the final result of what you are doing changing as you type right below where you are typing.  When you type a dot your mode switches from sub-domain name to domain name form.<p>This kind of thing isn't going to work everywhere but it's an example of the power of AJAX and how it can be used to make form fields much simpler for the user. AJAX definitely doesn't make form fields simpler for the developer.",1214496370

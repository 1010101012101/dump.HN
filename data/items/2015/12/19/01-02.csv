Probability can be on your side even when the job market isn&#x27;t.<p>Know your worth, but also be open to using your pedigree as a stepping stone to positions outside of your expertise. With 10 years of programming experience you can most likely learn enough Ruby in a short period of time to position yourself as a more compelling candidate than a Ruby dev fresh out of code school.<p>Consider startups. Smaller engineering teams often rely on interdisciplinary roles due to limited resources. Your role as a &quot;jack of all trades, master of nothing&quot; might actually be an asset to early stage companies.<p>Most importantly, find a healthy way of dealing with stress. Your family is depending you. This is an inherently stressful role to take but don&#x27;t let stress derail you. Rather, let it motivate you to open this new chapter of you life.

I&#x27;ve been similar in terms of having a life that others would consider pretty darn good but where you find yourself depressed to the point of being largely unable to function, no matter what treatment you try. I get it, it&#x27;s profoundly awful, and the world needs to to better at dealing with it, and that has become somewhat of a calling for me now that my own mental health is improving.<p>But all my research and experiences support the notion that <i>both</i> one&#x27;s experiences and one&#x27;s emotional reactions to those experiences are crucial. This is why you can have some people living seemingly perfect lives and winding up depressed, and others living through war and oppression and coming out fine.<p>In your friend&#x27;s case, the environmental factors could be: (1) pressure from outsiders to &quot;keep up appearances&quot;, (2) the negative messages and images that proliferate through the media of war, poverty, murder, terrorism, climate change etc, (3) a world that offers so many options of how to live but little consistent guidance about what is best, (4) living in a society that can still be very difficult for women, due to career challenges, threat of abuse, paternalistic attitudes etc.<p>These are just hypothetical of course, given that I don&#x27;t know her.<p>And for her to be crippled by depression in response to these or other stimuli would be as much to do with a <i>difference</i> in the way she responds to such things vs the &quot;average&quot; person.<p>But it may not even be <i>unhealthy</i>. Maybe her true calling is to work as a humanitarian helping the needy rather than doing what she&#x27;s been trying to do, and her depression is her mind&#x27;s way of making her realise she needs to make that kind of change.<p>Having gone through this process in myself and with others, when you dig deep enough, something like this always turns out to be there.<p>But my main point is that the mind does not and cannot function independently of a person&#x27;s environment, and paths to mental wellness that really work (and they do exist), involve addressing both one&#x27;s inner reactions to things <i>and</i> one&#x27;e outer environment.",1450487421

I probably open up the app manually (versus tapping on a notification) about 5 or 6 times a day.<p>It took me ~3-5 months of use to be able to look for the icon first versus looking for the text. Note that this is WITH keeping the icon in the exact same place on my home screen the entire time.<p>So that is what, 450 impressions for, well, no real speed improvement.<p>In a sea of words, a good icon can help an app stand out. But I&#x27;d argue that a good textual name helps more.<p>If you have multiple products, having your company name start off the title of all your products just means I cannot find your product in my alphabetized app list.<p>Changing app names is another huge problem. Google&#x27;s constant re-branding of how I send SMSs on my phone has been very unconductive to me remembering anything. Half the messaging apps out there have the same type of icon (a speech bubble), the textual names make them unique.<p>That said Facebook cheats by calling theirs Messenger. :)<p>Also, enough blue icons. Stop it. Everything is one of 3 shades of blue, gross color differentiation kicks in WAY before shape matching does. The three easiest apps to find on phone are the three apps that still have &quot;out of fashion&quot; black icons.<p>> Icons are like visual acronyms.<p>I disagree that the analogy is 100%. Our brains have this giant section dedicated to nothing but recognizing characters in our native written language. Sure we have a lot of brain power going to shape recognition in general, but character recognition is so incredibly trained in our heads that it should be our go to.",1450486842

After my first position making $130K I doubled my salary at another well known company to about $260K.<p>I know from recruiter spam that $260K seems to be on the high end, with only the top firms mentioned paying close to that.  I have friends that dwarf what I make, but they had good stock options at companies that made it to IPO.  Definitely don&#x27;t regret leaving NC.<p>I&#x27;d love to know what someone mildly famous like Mbstock, Rich Hickey, etc would make.  I am a nobody and have done what I consider well.",1450486838

Additionally, why put forth the time and expense to write or compose a CRM-like software solution that integrates with voter data, what sounds like a dialer/call center, and &quot;big data&quot; tools (Spark, Hadoop, Tableau, SSIS/SSRS) that probably needs a good 6 months lead time before the candidate even announces a run for office? Also, why would every potential candidate do this every 4 years?<p>Sounds like a perfect choice for a hosted solution that can be iterated on outside of the election cycle.",1450486806

9366426,comment,9364455,9365802,0,0,tempestn,,,"At least until this treatment comes to market, there has been nothing you could do to change your colorblindness.  Therefore it seems to me pretty natural that to have a positive outlook on life you would come to see it in as positive a light as possible.  In fact, it&#x27;s a common psychological mechanism to come to terms with elements of your life that cannot be changed, and to see yourself as better off for them.[1]<p>There are certainly positive aspects to colorblindness, just as there are to deafness, autism, and numerous other disabilities - even if it&#x27;s simply that it makes you more compassionate toward people with disabilities, or even people in general.  And as far as handicaps go, if it indeed is one, it&#x27;s certainly less impactful than most.  Is it a handicap though?  I would say a handicap is something that prevents you from doing things that the majority of the population can do, in a way that impacts your quality of life.  For me, if tulips looked like the right picture in the article[2], my quality of life would be impacted to some extent, even if the day to day events of life wouldn&#x27;t much change.  What if I&#x27;ve never experienced those colors though?  Am I still missing out?<p>It may seem like an academic question; after all, if you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re missing out and choose not to pursue treatment if/when it becomes available, certainly it doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone else.  But it can become an issue when you consider that the best time to administer such a treatment may be in infant-hood.  I&#x27;ve certainly read about deaf people refusing to give cochlear implants to their deaf children because they don&#x27;t believe that the child is missing out on anything of value, and/or that the advantages of deafness and the deaf community outweigh the disadvantages.  Having normal hearing, I certainly would not have wanted my parents to make such a choice.  (Although perhaps if I were deaf I would feel differently.)<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s probably obvious which way my opinion goes, but mostly I think it&#x27;s a discussion worth having.<p>[1] Dan Gilbert&#x27;s book Stumbling on Happiness is a good read on this and related topics.

I also worked at a software vendor (not autodesk, so no direct interest in replacing marionette))<p>There were/are two big things that are against you if you develop in house animation software(or any software for that matter):<p>1) The training gap. People are most efficient with the software they are used to. Maya has been the defacto standard in animation for pretty much 7 years (if not more).<p>2) the R&D cost. VFX is constantly moving. (Possibly much more than normal web software) With the increase in CPU/GPU power you are able to do much more. Take hair for example, In monsters inc, Sulley has something like a million hairs. (monsters U its 5million +) You need to control that hair system some how. There are people that groom digital hairs for a living. Its a constant battle between cheating, simulation and feedback.<p>The hair system alone could swallow a team of Five for a year, but then you&#x27;ll be negleting the other systems that need bug fixes, improvements and R&D magic.<p>Having an outside company, who has the resources to have many teams work on each individual part, along with a UX designer to either make it work more fluidly(or just put annoying transitions in the way.) and most importantly of all, a team of QA, bugfixers and Tech support.<p>You&#x27;re right, custom tools give you an edge, Take katana from sony: it allowed an artist to work on an entire city scape (Billions of objects) on a single computer, in 2006 (it was developed for one of the spiderman films) Something no other system could do.<p>Another example is of course renderman.<p>But these are only the successful ones. Many custom tools are built, atrophy and die. Sometimes taking the company with them.<p>But like the rest of IT the march of commoditisation is in VFX as well. Most software can be bought off the shelf (maya, modo, nuke, Premier, renderman, arnold) Its also almost possible to render in the cloud (although its crushingly expensive, and slower.)",1428911312

It generates numbers in [1,2) and then maps that to [0,1) by subtracting 1. This can be trivially shown to lose information, in fact I added a little hack to my github repo two days ago showing why it&#x27;s bogus when that specific library was mentioned to me (again). Unless you want to lose one bit of entropy in the first conversion every number gets. And it still doesn&#x27;t get us anywhere close to arbitrary ranges (which is the hard problem).<p>I also just looked at stuff that Agner Fog has published, thank you for mentioning him. Same thing. Maybe my understanding of floating point is bad, but his is worse. One generator uses the classic rng()/((double)range_of_rng) approach which is the whole reason why the C++ standard generators aren&#x27;t uniform (because it will only work you use a non-standard rounding mode for floating points and still doesn&#x27;t get us anywhere close to arbitrary ranges which are a completely different problem). Another uses [1,2) - 1.0 which loses information. And the third one is &quot;combines two different random number generators for improved randomness&quot;, which I guess sounds good, how does he do it? He generates two [0,1) numbers, adds them together then subtracts 1.0 when the result is bigger than 1.0 which both loses precision and compounds the rounding problems.<p>Literally the first thing I did when trying to figure this out months ago was to randomize the bits in the mantissa with a 0 exponent to get a [1,2) number then subtracted 1.0 from it, then it took me 10 minutes to test that this doesn&#x27;t actually work.<p>So, maybe my understanding of floating point numbers is bad, but the authorities you cite are worse.",1428910285

That is, teams are supposed to self-organize and independently do what is best for the business as a whole. Another prominent software company that practices holocracy is Valve Software, and their employee handbook [1] is one that I&#x27;ve seen mentioned by multiple people as a good implementation of holocracy.<p>The problem that holocracy is supposed to solve is that in a modern business environment, market conditions shift too quickly to allow management to have the sole responsibility for making decisions. Having self-organizing teams that take responsibility for advancing business goals, and allowing employees to shift between teams without getting permission from management first (&quot;open allocation&quot;) allows the company to develop an internal &quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; which ensures that good ideas win out and bad ideas are killed before they consume too many resources.<p>Now does it work in practice? I would say that it&#x27;s too soon to tell. Very few organizations have wholly embraced holocracy. Arguably the only one that&#x27;s truly embraced the practice is Valve. While the idea of a non-hierarchical organization sounds great in theory, we must also remember that status hierarchies are one of the few things that are common to every human civilization. As a PM colleague of mine put it succinctly, &quot;Middle school lunch rooms are holocracies too.&quot; I would say that a holocracy can work, so long as the corporate culture supports it... just like every other management strategy.",1428909441

My take is that he never gave her any space to be her own person with her own feelings, her own desires, her own dreams -- and though she was outwardly as successful as anyone could want, it wasn&#x27;t what she wanted to be doing, and she saw no way out of the life her father had designed for her other than killing herself.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Stanford-student-committed-suicide-with-pills-2545462.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Stanford-student-com...</a>",1428908964

Generics like Ada Generics, C++ templates, and Java Generics?  I think it’s fair to say that we are only beginning to understand the benefits and drawbacks of that approach to code generation, which is why every time I recompile the Java application I’m currently working on, I get erroneous warnings telling my that my varargs are causing heap pollution in my generic static methods.  (Which I can suppress, but instead I’m planning to delete those methods.)<p>Even OCaml, whose approach to parametric polymorphism is worlds simpler than any of the monstrosities mentioned above, just changed its approach by adding GADTs, which I still don’t understand fully despite the best efforts of generous HN commenters.<p>So I think that, given that Golang/Issue9 decided not to include inheritance, linear types, exceptions, or overloading (even of operators!), in large part because they aren’t well-understood, it’s entirely unsurprising that it decided not to include generics, either.",1428908902

First, because the Kindle allows you to dim the screen, and in fact, does so automatically in dark rooms. Pulling my Voyage out and comparing it to my screen with Flux, anecdotally, it looks to be producing less light than my laptop does.<p>And what are the alternatives? Not lighting the kindle display, and having you use an external light source? You have the same problem if you use LED lights - white light is generated in much the same way in LED bulbs, so you need to dim them as well, leaving you in the same position.<p>>You can tap both margins to advance the page.

And for the object side, the type of instance variables is hidden behind the public interface too.<p>So it&#x27;s really more about techniques for creating abstractions than how the values are composed together.",1428908772

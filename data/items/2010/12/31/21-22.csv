2056564,comment,2056020,2056301,0,0,jaysonelliot,,,"I went to college in the early nineties for art & design, started out by working as a print designer, and launched an independent magazine in 1992.<p>That led me to the web in '95, where I learned HTML by working right on the server, using vi as my text editor. We had a tiny shop, so everyone did everything. Graphic design, front end coding, content - the only thing I couldn't do was back-end stuff.<p>Eventually we were bought by Razorfish, and they decided some people would be called ""information architects,"" so in 1997 I took the title of IA, and went from there.<p>I've studied with various mentors, but my best education has come from Nielsen Norman Group's usability weeks, and constantly pestering people in emails, on message boards, listservs, conferences, you name it. The UX community is pretty tight-knit, and people really help each other out.<p>In the years that I've done IA and UX, I've worked for IBM, Disney, and several large agencies. I started as a usability freak, but have expanded my horizons to realize that there's a whole spectrum of things that are important to a good experience.<p>The best wakeup calls I had were when Don Norman published ""Emotional Design,"" and when Peter Morville made his UX honeycomb ( <a href=""http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000029.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000029.php</a>)<p>I'm now executive director for a large NY agency with offices worldwide, and I have a very diverse group of UX people in the different offices.<p>One thing I look for in a UX practitioner is a diversity of experience and background. Someone who studied IA in college and has only been on one path often has trouble empathizing with real world users.<p>I have hired people with degrees in library sciences, human computer interaction, design, computer science, psychology, human factors, even theater. It's all about how a person solves problems to me, not the degree they pursued.<p>I'd encourage your friend to spend more time on listservs like IXDA or SIGIA, going to conferences like Adaptive Path's UX Week and N/Ng's usability week, and making that his new education. It's incredibly rewarding.",1293832498

2056536,comment,2056260,2056468,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Since you were polite, I'll actually explain. Museo 500's tendency to block up is something I deliberately exploit. My tumblr is not often a venue for long-form blog posts; it is almost exclusively for link sharing and my photography. Small blocks of Museo ""flow"" very well along with those sorts of media posts. Long blocks blend together and stream past, providing only a slight interruption to the flow of media and links.<p>I admit it's sub-optimal for long form posts like this, but it's a tradeoff I've decided to make for the sake of the majority of my tumblr's content. I <i>could</i> make a script to detect when the tumblr is showing a single post, changing the font. I just haven't yet, and I don't get that many complaints. Most people are happy to see any sort of original design and deliberate typography on a blog, even if it isn't perfect.<p>I still think it's fairly readable.

2056531,comment,2055939,2056250,0,0,patrickgzill,,,"I think you hit on something very important - that the buyers who decide what gets sent to the bookstore matter a lot.<p>Let me give you a couple of examples from the days when my parents ran a general and Christian books and music store...<p>The store was located close to several antique shops - women would go antiquing, drag their husbands along, then stop at the bookstore.  Our bookstore had a huge selection of books on antiques and collectibles for just this reason - stuff you would be hard pressed to find even today in a Borders or B&N, like a $200 book on Tiffany Lamps, or even a $30 book on Depression era pressed glass.<p>Of course, the men were often bored - until they saw the books we had on cars, trucks, car repair, woodworking, military aircraft, etc.<p>We would sell at least $1000/week of car repair manuals such as the Chilton or Motorcraft series (and this was a small store).  The $17 book on small gas engine repair (lawnmowers etc.) did very well also.<p>When we found people were restoring old Mustangs, we started carrying the $80-$110 Hollander Interchange manuals, which tell you which parts from which Mustangs are exactly the same for each year (e.g. a suspension component from any of 65-68 Mustangs might be identical, making it easier to find the part).<p>If you walk into a Borders today, you will find very little customization of each store for the local market.  For instance, in the York, PA, store, home of a big Harley Davidson factory and filled with people who like hot rods (big cruise nights in the area) ... not even a small table packed with such books.<p>Second example:  the Christian music buyers were always focused on the teen market (Christian Rock like Petra, etc.) -- but Christian music-buying teens usually have far less allowance money (IME) because their parents are more conservative.<p>So our music selection ignored the teens, and focused on having the music that the parents or other Christian adults would want (tended to be Christian country, Sandi Patti, and Christmas albums).  Those folks, being adults, and in the prime of their earning years, had little hesitation in buying, often multiple items at a time.  The buyers at other stores turned up their nose at such folksy stuff, to their detriment I think.<p>Imagine the sales lost by bookstores nationwide by focusing on Twilight books, heavily discounted, which attract distracted and less-rich teens, versus looking for and exploiting local niches.",1293831650

Kept under control, and used for shorter terms (say a year detailed, and two more sort of general and subject to change as you learn more) it can be useful; otherwise it often is just a personalized version of the old Soviet ""Five-Year Plans"".<p>ADDED: Rereading this, I think I missed my point slightly; the problem with minimalism as described here is that it locks you in too much to your current plan; it reduces your flexibility to adjust your plans as you learn more about your problem space.",1293831582

Not sure I can help you with any maxims on maintaining a healthy marriage but on the startup front I would suggest you strongly consider a pre-nup - or if the wedding is this evening, a post-nup.<p>I sincerely hope you never end up in a divorce situation but during mine (under California law) I had to give up 50% of my equity and options rights in the startups I've been involved in that occurred during the marriage because they were 'community property' (ie owned by the couple).<p>I'm not a lawyer, but if you have your own startup and your wife isn't a shareholder and you divorce she is entitled to 50% of anything you vested during that time.  It works both ways if she is also involved in startups (ie you would get 50% of hers) and to that end you could agree to trade/cancel things out.  I was able to buy my ex-wife out because I didn't want her to remain involved in the company but it was very costly.  There's a longer and more gory story in here but this isn't really the place to get into it plus confidentially issues come into play.<p>When you get married, you don't really want to think about divorce. In the same way when you form the company documents for your startup, you don't really think about an IPO or an exit - yet in both cases at that end point some of the decisions you made at the start will come into play and so it's important to get things in order now.<p>EDIT: Another tid-bit of info - if you exercise options or sell the company your spouse has to sign-off agreement on the documents.

Time: Make time for each other. Schedule it as if it's a big important meeting with an investor if need be. Even better is to have a routine that naturally makes time for you two to be together. Whatever it takes.<p>2. Talking: Always talk about everything that might be going wrong or right. This is especially true in the early days as you figure what this marriage thing is all about. No relationship I know of broke down because the couple communicated too much.<p>3. Adapt: What you have now is not what you're going to have in a year's time and certainly not you'll have in 2 years. Your startup might succeed or it might fail. You will have unforseen family obligations come up at the most inopportune time. One of you might lose their job or get ill long term.

Most states passed usury laws pretty soon after the U.S. was formed, and by the mid 1800s almost all had pretty strict interest-rate caps. They were loosened a bit towards the end of the 19th century, though some were strengthened again in the early 20th.<p>In 1978, the Supreme Court ruled that states couldn't enforce their usury laws against nationally chartered out-of-state banks--- the usury laws of the <i>bank's</i> state, not the <i>customer's</i> state, were the only ones that applied. That effectively killed usury laws, because it meant that banks just all incorporated in the states with the weakest usury laws. Then Congress completely preempted state usury laws for nationally-chartered banks in 1980.<p>But from sometime in the early/mid 1800s to 1978, most states had interest-rate caps in the 8-14% range, and most are still on the books, just ineffectual.",1293830092

I can't imagine all the work that must have gone into this.<p>To me, this seems to only solve a corner case in the main problem of JS testing - testing the DOM without a browser. The first question that comes to mind is, is a DOM even useful in a headless browser when it comes to JS? For now, grant that we're only testing presence and manipulation of DOM elements and no CSS manipulations or accuracy -- which I'd argue is a decent case for testing. Now, testing presence and manipulation of DOM elements in the abstract isn't very useful, as different browsers might treat DOM manipulations differently. Using a headless browser that no one actually uses doesn't solve this problem.<p>I'd see a case for this in running something like QUnit[1] test that just test JS completeness, but again, implementations differ so testing in one environment that no one actually is using isn't good enough.<p>The only thing that I've come up with for a solution for actually testing JavaScript in a robust, real-world way is using QUnit and Selenium[2] to define the tests, with Testswarm[3] actually running the tests. This setup allows unit tests to be run against JS by itself (QUnir), mock interactions to take place to ensure bindings work properly (Selenium), and have these executed against real browsers in a distributed manner (Testswarm).<p>I concede that this isn't an ideal solution, and I wish there were more people working on solutions like Zombie.js that would combine all of these in one so that JS could finally be apart of our continuous integration testing. The only (sic) thing preventing this solution is that it needs to have headless, identical implementations of all the browser's JS engines and DOM parsers in order to be valid.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://seleniumhq.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seleniumhq.org/</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://github.com/jeresig/testswarm/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jeresig/testswarm/wiki</a>",1293829340

7530289,comment,7529435,7529999,1,0,dTal,,,"I think you&#x27;re looking at NICE the wrong way - the monetary value of a human life is not arbitrary, it is measured in terms of <i>other lives</i>. It is arguably unethical to spend millions of pounds to save one person&#x27;s life, when that same million pounds could have saved 10 other people, or more. On the other hand, the whole point of socialised medicine is the guarantee that society will go out of its way for you in your time of need. Balancing utilitarian ethics and socialist ethics is the essential but unenviable job of NICE.<p>As for forcing companies to sell life-saving drugs at reasonable cost, I&#x27;m all for it, but it seems to me to be a major problem that such vital societal functions as advancing the medical state of the art are left to organisational structures that exist in a landscape where ethics and altruism are highly selected against.",1396605465

7530273,comment,7529799,7529979,1,0,chris_overseas,,,"True enough. That reinforces a couple of other points that tend to become apparent from these sorts of comparisons and benchmarks:<p>1) High level languages are easier to refactor and maintain than lower level languages (changing the algorithm in the assembly&#x27;s a big job).<p>2) For performance, the algorithm used is almost always more important than the language you choose to implement it in.<p>Both of those points back up the author&#x27;s assertion, it&#x27;s a shame he didn&#x27;t specifically discuss them.<p>I used to hand-code assembly (or generate it, eg &quot;compiled bitmaps&quot;) back in the 8086 days. For many situations there were easy gains to be had that couldn&#x27;t be achieved so easily in high level languages. These days I wouldn&#x27;t dream of attempting it other than perhaps for vector code in an inner loop. I&#x27;d far rather spend the time profiling and optimising the algorithms and data structures because that&#x27;s where the big gains are going to be.

7530242,comment,7522327,7529603,1,0,beagle3,,,"> My thoughts on this area have changed a bunch, I think when I was young I was a lot more about cleverness and conciseness.<p>I&#x27;m almost the other way around. I always valued elegance, which often manifests itself in conciseness (but most conciseness is NOT an example of elegance). Followed by readability, which usually manifests itself in verbosity (though most verbosity is NOT actually readable). And when decision time came, I&#x27;d prefer verbose inelegant code to non-verbose concise code.<p>But then, I spent some time using K. And I realized I need 100-1000 times less lines to achieve the same thing, AND it usually works about as fast (despite an interpreter), AND I have less bugs AND those bugs tend to be of one kind (off-by-one) and easy to find.<p>e.g., look at this example by Stevan Apter: <a href=""http://nsl.com/k/t.k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nsl.com/k/t.k</a> - 14 short lines implement an efficient (fast and memory compact) memory database than includes joins, selects, inserts, deletes, aggregates, grouping and sorting.<p>To the uninitiated, it looks like code golf, but this is actually very readable K if you know K. The definition\n    order:where:{[t;f;o]{x y z x}/[_n;o;t f]}\ngives two names (&quot;order&quot; and &quot;where&quot;) to an idiomatic K expression that takes a table &quot;t&quot;, and paired lists &quot;f&quot; (of field names) and &quot;o&quot; (of re-index functions that can be used to filter or sort), and returns the resulting table after reindexing, one by one, applying those functions to their relevant fields. A sorting function would be &quot;desc:>:&quot; (that is, &quot;>:&quot; hereforth also named &quot;desc&quot;) which returns a sorting permutation for its argument. A filtering function would be &quot;&3>&quot; (prnounced &quot;where 3 is larger than&quot; and can be written &quot;where 3>&quot; in the Q dialect).<p>Now, this conciseness does NOT come from golfing. It comes from eschewing the now obligatory object oriented programming, sticking with &quot;down to the metal&quot; data types, and rather than trying to find the minimal base of operations and endless compositions (like most languages do), use a wide base of operations and a precisely chosen set of compositions.<p>It is true that reading/writing a K line takes 10-50 times as long as reading a C line. But I&#x27;ve been unable to consider modern software engineering anything but ludicrous when a different set of primitives (and experience) can get you the same results for 1/100 or 1/1000 of the size of the executable specification, and everyone puts a SEP field on it.",1396604477

Whether you need to use assembly depends on the particular situation at hand.<p>Here&#x27;s a practical example: as a result of redesigning the algorithm to use fixed-point and implementing it in assembly, I got it to run 600x faster than the initial C version. Big O complexity was the same, the difference was in the constant factor. But the constant factor matters! In my case, it meant that you could get your computation done in half a day instead of a year.<p>Yes, it took me 3 weeks to get the algorithm implemented, instead of a single day, but even so — it was definitely worth it.

Not mentioning web standards here because the web standards were whatever IExplorer was doing, 10 years ago.<p>In so far as forgiveness for mistakes that happened 10 years ago - dude, many of us don&#x27;t have a short memory and many of us don&#x27;t forgive so easily, not when we aren&#x27;t seeing signs that a company changed. I&#x27;m happy for these recent announcements - it seems that there is interest amongst the upper management to change things, now that Ballmer is gone. And Roslyn (with F# before it) - are the first projects of any significance that they are open-sourcing and F# is finally accepting contributions from third-parties.<p>But lo and behold - Microsoft is choking Android with patents infringement threats, because obviously, when you can&#x27;t innovate, you can always litigate, especially when you have a war chest that was built starting in the early eighties. I don&#x27;t hate patent trolls as much as I hate big companies that are becoming obsolete and with stuffed legal departments that sit on their asses all day thinking of how to &quot;monetize&quot; their bullshit IP, that was built on top of prior art in a time when software patents weren&#x27;t the norm mind you.<p>So I&#x27;ll forgive Microsoft the day they stop threatening and litigating and strong-arm their way into new markets. And don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;m not seeing what Google and Apple are doing. Neither of them resemble the companies I fell in love with years ago. And they should pay attention to Microsoft, as public trust once lost is very hard to regain.",1396603031

PyPy has achieved impressive performance with its tracing JIT; Jython and IronPython are both built on top of mature VMs with extensive JIT support.  So why do we think it’s worth starting a new implementation?<p>In short, it’s because we think the most promising techniques are incompatible with existing implementations.  For instance, the JavaScript world has switched from tracing JITs to method-at-a-time JITs, due to the compelling performance benefits.  Whether or not the same performance advantage holds for Python is an open question, but since the two approaches are fundamentally incompatible, the only way to start answering the question is to build a new method-at-a-time JIT.<p>Another point of differentiation is the planned use of a conservative garbage collector to support extension modules efficiently.  Again, we won’t know until later whether this is a better approach or not, but it’s a decision that’s integral enough to a JIT that it is difficult to test in an existing implementation.<p>The downside of starting from scratch is, unsurprisingly, that creating a new language implementation is an enormous task.  Luckily, tools are starting to come out that can help with this process; in particular, Pyston is built on top of LLVM, which lets us achieve top-tier code generation quality without having to deal with the details ourselves. Nonetheless, a new Python implementation is a huge undertaking, and Pyston will not be ready for use soon.",1396602533

5481395,comment,5475614,5476084,1,0,dalke,,,"I have a difficult time with the phrase ""professional."" I used to think it had some meaning. Now I think it's a code word for ""don't do things that the managers/organizers don't like.""<p>Can I wear a pony suit to work and be professional? What about at DjangoCon? What about wearing shorts and sandals? In some places they are acceptable, in others they are not. Does that make them professional or not? So it seems like DjangoCon allows certain types of non-professional conduct.<p>Is it professional to drink alcohol while at work in most programming companies? What about taking a nap during someone's presentation? I don't think so. Is the same true for DjangoCon? I don't think so. I've done both at conferences, and people knew about it, and no one seemed to have a problem with it. I've seen others do the same.<p>There's another meaning of ""professional"", which is to do quality work, and be responsible for any errors that occurred. I don't think this is the type of ""professional"" that people mean. I've not seen anyone kicked out or even chided by the organizers for presenting a lousy and unprofessional presentation.<p>As to the coffee shop example, that can be judged without reference to respect. The goal of a coffee shop is to sell coffee. They have broad discretion as to what they think is the way of achieving that goal. This is based on property law. If they don't want you to play loud riffs at 4pm then they don't have to claim there was disrespect, only that it's unwanted, and they can use the credible threat of police response to back their demand that you leave.<p>The neighbors also have some say in the matter. Loud music might be prohibited, and your amp is turned up too high. Again, ""respect"" doesn't factor into this at all.<p>But for a dinner party, or for Django, I don't think it's possible to have a good definition of ""professional"" or ""respectful."" It comes down to the vague ""don't do things that we don't like, otherwise we'll kick you out."" Using ""professional"" just makes it sound more objective.",1364929161

People that implore others to examine their privilege don't do so to make people feel bad (although this may be a side effect of having a new perspective).<p>> Our differences and our circumstances conspire to make it so that not everyone has the exact same shot at success, but that's not the worst possible thing that could happen either.<p>That's the thing, privileged majority groups often enact or re-enforce policy or social attitudes that have the effect of keeping people not in that group from success. The call to examine one's privilege is so that members of the majority group recognize how their position and actions keeps other people from success. Note that by success I do not just mean financial success, but even being alive for members of some groups is a success based on the amount of violence they face.<p>> If you want to reduce unfair privilege I would recommend starting by helping those without it, instead of obligating those with it.<p>You cannot simply opt out of privilege. Privilege is just as much about how others view you as the social systems and institutions that back you over other groups of people. Also, people who are suffering from the systems and institutions do not want a hand out, they want to be free to have their own voices and agency, something that is hard to do when privileged groups continue to undermine their attempts at that agency.",1364928944

But the other problem is that not everyone can contribute evenly. Thus begins the problem of pushing for fairness so that some pay more than others. Then to be more fair there's a push to increase the limit as to what constitutes ""too poor"" to pay. Next thing you know politicians are using it to buy votes. Today it's ""vote for me or they'll take away your Social Security!"" and tomorrow it will be ""vote for me or they'll take away your health insurance!""<p>#2 is the most common way in the US but not necessarily through just unions. It's all about group plans and whatnot in an effort to control pricing. The problem is that this method doesn't cover everyone and discourages certain types of employment as described elsewhere in this thread. In some cases, large unions use the benefits as leverage against their members for various reasons and/or against the employer as a PR tool such as ""they are hurting our kids!"" type of tactic.<p>#3 is part of my point as one of the reasons that companies went wild on offering health benefits to workers was to get around a government enforced wage freeze during war. There were companies that offered such benefits before but during the wage freeze it started to become normal to be offered the benefits.<p>I find it fascinating that after decades of escalation in the problems in US healthcare and insurance the best solutions anyone can come up with and/or get passed is to increase the very thing that almost everyone agrees is broken.

I think if your goal is merely to show that free will can't be discounted by the laws of the known universe you're better off comparing it to ""strange matter,"" things that share physical properties with most matter but are missing fundamental blocks of what we call matter like mass (gravitons) or interaction with matter (neutrinos). That allows us to say that if this ""strange matter"" can violate those rules, there is the possibility that something exists in the universe that operates on the fringe of known matter, still interacting but violating most of what we consider ""rules"" regarding matter's existence, perhaps even allowing us to operate freely.
In computing terms, free will is probably more like a systemic computer, maybe it's more easily understood as a human's ability to reprogram itself. A highly evolved, biological machine capable of reprogramming itself. Although that just begs the question since the reprogrammer must still be programmed at some higher level to follow commands.
The process of making a biological machine like that is a blast, but they're wildly unpredictable, as you would expect anything truly capable of freely reprogramming itself would be. ;)",1364928188

Having that makes it easier to personalize outreach and stay up to date with what folks are doing.<p>2) Outreach tracks. For a long time I've wanted a CRM to have adjustable sales tracks. So the way that might work is there's an initial outreach, and then the next step changes based on what the outcome of that was. If I get no reply, then remind me to follow up in a week or so and let me add a template for that follow up. If I get a reply, then let me note what happened and then go down a different path to closing. If I get an objection, then let me choose from a list of objection options with a template that I've already developed for each of them.<p>I'm a single data point, so don't take it as gospel.

The value they created then is the possibility of a good work being created.<p>Investment is not a value-adding activity. When you invest, others' value-adding is what makes your investment grow. The value-adders are the people who take your capital and use it to make something of greater value than the principal amount you invested.<p>You're onto something when you mention commissioning works of art, though. Currently the motivation for companies to invest in the production of art is the ROI they can get from (exclusively) selling copies of the art, as guaranteed by copyrights. If copyrights are technologically obsolete because copying is now virtually free, then we as a society do need to find a new way to finance the creation of large-scale, expensive works of art--if we still want to enjoy that type of entertainment, that is.",1364927797

Jamie will also be showcasing a Pusher walkthrough which will help by introducing a sensible starting point towards a structured and declarative integration with your Ember application.<p>Also (to make up for our mea culpa moment) we have Amsterdam Breweries delivering some of their good stuff to keep things bright and social.

I agree with most of the comments here that it's difficult to find a full-service solution since different learners have different needs.<p>It's very interesting that general consumers recognize RST for what it is: a massive marketing machine that took a standard, linguistic approach to language learning and applied it across many languages. What other products are so bluntly recognized as overpriced but fantastically executed from a marketing & sales approach to where year in and year out people are coming through the door?!?! I would argue that LiveMocha was just as guilty of applying a standard solution across many langauges. Different languages require different methods and approaches.<p>I run <a href=""http://lingo-live.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lingo-live.com/</a> which is focused solely on Spanish. As a result, we have a small customer base who NEED or REALLY WANT to learn Spanish and have catered our product to this very specific need (also we further segmented our users into people who mainly want to SPEAK Spanish vs. write or read it, have very busy schedules, and are comfortable accessing their learning entirely over the internet, including live lessons with their tutor over Skype). Not having to worry about how we teach Chinese/Portugese/English/Esperanto... is a huge benefit and we can rely far less on ad spend and more on referrals and WoM since our students are actively engaged with our Spanish service and have someone keeping them accountable to their learning.<p>Then again, the number one answer we get when speaking to potential students when we ask how they would have gone about searching for a Spanish learning solution is ""Rosetta Stone Spanish"". Maybe the marketing is more powerful than WoM but how sustainable is it? RST has been running in the red for the last 3 years despite some significant cost-cutting and there are countless articles about the inefficacy of their solution (a few below)

In terms of security risks, I consider Webmin pretty low on the list, because of its good security history (see <a href=""http://webmin.com/security.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webmin.com/security.html</a> for the security history going back several years). It does provide root access, though, which makes it a very valuable target for exploits. As far as we know, Webmin is not implicated as a vector in this particular attack. Plesk has been mentioned as correlated with this attack, but I don't think that's been confirmed, and Plesk has no relation to Webmin, so it seems an odd choice.<p>Source and disclaimer: I am a developer on the Webmin and Virtualmin projects, and co-founder of Virtualmin, Inc.",1364926073

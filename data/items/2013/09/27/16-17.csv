It is the same case if you aren&#x27;t so hot, if you are ugly, you are probably also stupid. Perhaps the men tried to make a move on her and she shot them down, and as punishment are treating her like a box of rocks. Maybe there is another woman that works with her that is older and less pretty and is trashing her behind her back.

It needs more enforcement of transparency on the side of the companies. The difference between gambling and &quot;investing&quot; of this sort is that at least gambling is 100% transparent. You know exactly what the odds are at the roulette table.

Beech-Nut wanted to increase consumer demand for bacon. Bernays turned to his agencys internal doctor and asked him whether a heavier breakfast might be more beneficial for the American public. Knowing which way his bread was buttered, the doctor confirmed Bernays suspicion and wrote to five thousand of his doctors friends asking them to confirm it as well. This study of doctors encouraging the American public to eat a heavier breakfast  namely Bacon and Eggs  was published in major newspapers and magazines of the time to great success. Beech-Nuts profits rose sharply thanks to Bernays and his team of medical professionals.</i><p>The irony is that this is at least half right.  Eating protein for breakfast is considered healthy.  Perhaps there are better ways to get protein than bacon and fried eggs, but it&#x27;s not completely off base.",1380300660

The fair value from the point of view of taxation is the value when you earned it, whether bitcoin or stock options (maybe with options it&#x27;s timed at when you exercise, I&#x27;m not sure).<p>Imagine a person who earned $10,000 and chose to buy some stock with it, and then that stock crashed.  Did that person get taxed on stock that was worthless?  Of course not, they earned money (which was taxed) and chose to invest it in something risky.  The person who chooses to keep their stock is no different.  They could have chosen to sell, and avoid the risk.<p>Bitcoin is less liquid than stock, so it is harder for a bitcoin miner to avoid these risks.

The data are released as a set, with raw[1] and calibrated data released concurrently.

Very few people, as it turns out. Who but a planetary scientist getting paid to do Lunar stuff has the time, ability and inclination?

6457714,comment,6456941,6456941,1,0,yk,,,"Unfortunately this is the state of journalism today. In the length of an article it is only possible to make one point, at least outside of a dense article aimed at a specialist audience. Additionally the article should seem to be relevant, that means that its single point need to be exaggerated until it seems earth shattering. And journalists are not really payed to research a topic in depth, but to write articles.<p>So this is at least the impression I get from every article, where I actually know something about the topic. In theoretical physics every article describes one paper, and calls it a break through towards quantum gravity. Independent if this is a cute toy model, a interesting trick to calculate some technical problem or a actual attempt at quantum gravity, in which case there is certainly no data to back up the theory and the theory is almost certainly wrong. Another thing is any reporting about nuclear energy, either the article is wildly exaggerating the dangers of nuclear energy or it is wildly overstating the necessity of nuclear energy. ( Nuclear energy is IMHO a particularly nasty example for articles, because the dangers are extremely model dependent, so to inform a lay audience one would need an entire book.) And for programming, well the wired article did not strike me as a particular bad offender.<p>This would be tolerable, if it would not bias the political process. The current German president, Joachim Gauck, is a nice example. [1] In 2010 the, in this context center-left, SPD had no chance at electing their own candidate, so they attempted a PR coup by nominating a guy who is a hero for conservatives, while the conservative CDU did elect a career politician. Much to the dismay of conservative talking heads. Last year, the president had to resign [2] and chancellor Merkel did nominate Gauck, knowing that now the SPD is on the hook because he was their candidate. And all political commentators in Germany did just dust off their opinion pieces from two years ago.<p>In conclusion, I have no idea how to fix journalism. But I think that better journalism is badly needed. Or else the control loop for the political process has less and less input from actual facts and deep thought and is only controlled by some self consistent PR bullshit.<p>Edit: Clarified the conclusion.<p>[1] In Germany the president has a largely ceremonial role and is elected by an assembly of the parliament and (some members of) the state parliaments.<p>[2] Itself only a media phenomenon.",1380298479

I don&#x27;t know if this has been tested in high stress situations, and I would guess that the &quot;warm up time&quot; is faster if your adrenaline is pumping, but it&#x27;s still going to be a lot worse than having already been awake.",1380297964

6457658,comment,6457171,6457604,4,0,Apocryphon,,,"> Google and its employees have no obligation to patronize public transportation, nor do you.<p>Of course not. This is a free country. Of the developed world, we probably put the among least obligations on corporations. But I&#x27;m not talking about legal obligations. I&#x27;m talking about a social responsibility. Just because you don&#x27;t have to, doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t.<p>> That would be nice, but the shitty public transportation system built, operated, managed, and owned by the government is not the fault or responsibility of Google and friends. Google is not the reason it&#x27;s a piece of shit either.<p>Of course not, It&#x27;s largely the fault of an ingrained culture of NIMBYism that drives city and county governments to reject greater expansion of public transportation, coupled with budget cuts, a car culture, and so on. But my speculation is that with their wealth, companies like Google, Facebook, and others, can possibly place influence on those gov&#x27;ts to shift their attitudes, at least gradually.<p>> Google is the top philanthropist in the Bay Area giving $27.6 million to charities here in 2010.<p>For which they certainly should be lauded for. And which is a good start. But I&#x27;m sure there are more ways that corporations can give back to communities other than employing their populations and giving money for charity.",1380297872

6457656,comment,6455912,6457217,5,0,waps,,,"It isn&#x27;t just climate theory. I have the distinct impression that the whole world has been getting every more &quot;certain&quot; and intolerant about the local viewpoints, and it has become ever less acceptable to diverge from the norm. Alternative viewpoints used to be more than acceptable, and attacking people over alternative viewpoints was what was bad.<p>Today there&#x27;s a million thing you can&#x27;t disagree with in polite company. Climate theory (even the lunatic claims, like that temperature will keep rising until the seas boil or other such drivel), and the associated evil of humans, and the goodness of nature (pointing out exactly what natural selection means is liable to make you persona non grata). Species that can&#x27;t quickly adapt don&#x27;t deserve to live. That&#x27;s what evolution says. But guess what, that&#x27;s not what anybody means when they say nature. That seems to come from Disney films.<p>You aren&#x27;t allowed to deny that alternative &quot;natural&quot; things are good for you, when in fact that&#x27;s usually flat out wrong. Natural bread is not, in fact, better for you. And yes, fibre is good for you, but fibre in scientific papers is something <i>entirely</i> different from what makes bread brown. Telling someone who believes in homoeopathy that they&#x27;re, well, morons, is no longer acceptable. In climate &quot;intolerance&quot;, at least the scientific side can be said to have the upper hand, but ...<p>The same goes for cultures. Anyone with a basic knowledge of different cultures knows that every culture has extremely offensive and immoral components. Equality of cultures ... great soundbite ! Except ... we do put our own culture first, and in practice all religions and ideologies except western Christianity promote completely unacceptable. Equality, between men and women, and legal equality between people in society is something uniquely western. Tolerate muslims ... sounds good, until you actually read how the culture works. Look up dhimma, look up devshirme, look up zakat, look up the racist conditions of halal meat, those things are morally reprehensible. Likewise, the structure of Hindu society is morally abhorrent in it&#x27;s inequality. God forbid anyone mentions that. And God forbid anyone asks a muslim whether they think the prophet is a moral abomination, no matter how obviously true it is. Facts no longer matter.<p>Another problem is that I&#x27;ve visited Egypt a few years back. Complete intolerance for any differences in opinion is also happening there, and it&#x27;s doing the exact same thing. Believe it or not, the divergence of society around religion (you can&#x27;t put it like this in Egypt or you&#x27;ll get shot, but it&#x27;s essentially true : ex-muslims versus extremists) is nothing new. It existed 50 years back just the same as today. What IS new, however, is that it&#x27;s perfectly normal for both sides to violently suppress any sign of the other side where they see it. It&#x27;s not just muslim extremists being intolerant, the regular kind is just as bad these days, and so are the &quot;non-religous&quot;, it&#x27;s just as much the ex-muslim side. Asking a woman to cover up for a special event, no matter how atheist she felt, was perfectly acceptable. Now it&#x27;s likely to get you shot. The same happens on the other side. 30 years ago, girls from religious families dated (that they still -sort of- do, in fact they&#x27;re much more easy to get in bed, both the religious and the non-religious), and they dressed according to the occasion, what they expected their date to prefer. For going dancing religious girls certainly didn&#x27;t don &quot;traditional&quot; clothing. Today, asking a woman on a date to take off her veil will immediately provoke violence from bystanders, even if the girl herself wants to do it (probably even if she were to take the initiative). This was an extremely normal thing to do 15 years ago. What the fuck. But I&#x27;m seeing signs of the same thing happening right here in America.<p>And yes, the ex-muslims seem to be losing the fight, in Egypt, but it&#x27;s not over. The extremists have no good alternative, so they&#x27;re fighting for nothing. Which means either side can&#x27;t win. Both sides have more than proven they can do a lot of damage before they lose. But why is there a fight at all ? Clearly it <i>is</i> possible to live together, they&#x27;ve fucking done it for 50 years.<p>We seem to generally feel that anyone is entitled to their own belief, and is allowed to act like a total moron on the matter. And yes, I will call climate &quot;advocacy&quot; just a belief, because the vast majority of people pushing it wouldn&#x27;t know how to average a temperature series. And you can call in &quot;facts&quot;, sure. But the only kind of valid facts are facts that are properly sourced. If you don&#x27;t know why you believe something and can point to serious publications defending that, it&#x27;s not a fucking fact.<p>Where a belief has the majority of the population on it&#x27;s side, whether it&#x27;s islam, climate adherents or denialists, socialists, bible-thumpers, communists, ... that majority finds now finds it perfectly acceptable to use psychological and real violence against the other side. Maybe I didn&#x27;t look around enough when I was younger, but I certainly get the impression things have gotten worse. A lot worse. Because the majority of people are morons, no matter the specific belief they&#x27;re pushing, you find basic logic errors and inconsistencies a 4 year old could find in pretty much every popular text on any subject, as you illustrate with climate science. WTF. Also, that majority is allowed to invent or deny facts to support their view, and obvious logical errors go unchallenged.<p>Of course we&#x27;ve also managed to adopt contradictory views in the meantime, and over &quot;large&quot; distances, the adopted ideologies differ quite a bit. And everybody is digging in.<p>This will not end well.",1380297819

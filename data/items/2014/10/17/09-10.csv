The community leaders who supposedly are representing the kids at the city hall protest should have been their voice at all those meetings. It would be outrageous that the city council didn&#x27;t think of the kids when they drafted the policy.<p><i>Parks and recreation general manager Phil Ginsburg said that his department made that decision after notifying 700 community leaders and all residents within a quarter-mile of the park in English and Spanish and holding three community meetings back in 2009. He said that the new system left the park open for drop-in play 96 percent of the time.</i><p>With the park open for drop-in play 96% of the time surely there was evening time for the kids? Did nothing come from notifying 700 community leaders and holding 3 community meetings? Of course the parks board may have ignored all the recommendations, but what do they gain with a paltry $27 per reservation fee? I don&#x27;t think the community activists will be happy until they get rid of the reservation system.

How should the prices increase? Exponentially, adjusted for inflation? Will the prices be much too low for much too long, or will they rocket up at unreasonable rates for some kinds of media?<p>I think the best scheme for works entering the public domain is modelled on <i>eminent</i> domain.

An equivalent to an old UK grammar school concept.<p>This is going to sound pretty harsh, but while it is hard to generalize, there is a strong tendency for children who come from Turkish backgrounds (especially boys) to be disruptive influences in class. This starts at an early age, and thus tracking tends to dump these children in Realschule and Hauptschule.<p>This disruption in class is especially the case with female teachers, for whom the boys hold little respect for. Their culture appears to hold little respect for women in the workplace. The father&#x27;s hold similar disrespecting views at parent evenings as well. The effect is reversed with male teachers.<p>This is cultural problem on both sides and as a result the children lose out. Children that could have been successful academically are penalized both by the system&#x27;s inherent failure to integrate migrants and as a direct result of their family&#x27;s misogyny.<p>Germany likes to think that it is &quot;Multikulti&quot; [1], but my experiences so far seem to show a multi-culturalism that is a &quot;pretty sheen&quot; over the top of suspicion and disrespect.

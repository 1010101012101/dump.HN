7997989,comment,7996464,7997151,4,0,tracker1,,,"You do realize that there is a JSON Schema specification, not to mention that JSON more naturally matches a program&#x27;s object structure for serialization and deserialization.  Generally speaking XML is more flexible than any object representation should be.  Objects tend to have properties, and those properties may be a given type.  But XML may define some properties as attributes, and others as a single /nested child element and others as 1+ child elements, or a child element with 1+ child elements.  JSON is a natural, easy to understand and comprehend map without extra content that really isn&#x27;t needed.  JSON maps neatly to several object streaming systems, XML does not.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but XML isn&#x27;t some panacea of describing or encoding document structures.  It&#x27;s generally a collection of fragile verbose and overly complicated tools in a few given platforms to satisfy people that think enterprise programming means implementing every pattern that loosely fits their situation instead of clean, simple, elegant solutions that hide complexity where needed instead of creating more.<p>JSON + JSON-Schema is no more of a mess than XML + XML Schemas.

7997944,comment,7996210,7997064,8,0,mhsiah,,,"I am OP&#x27;s &quot;friend who is a maths PhD&quot;.  I&#x27;d just like to expand Grovulent&#x27;s version of my position a bit to make it a little more convincing.  To my mind, all of the problems are explained by the following three things:<p>1) Echoing vlasev [1], I think a very good analogy of the relation between proofs in mathematical logic and proofs in &quot;normal&quot; mathematics is that of the difference between programming in assembly (portability issues notwithstanding, though mathematical logic is probably a friendly RISC arch) and programming in a dense high-level language like Haskell.  The productivity gain from using the high-level language, that permits skipping all those pesky unimportant details, is <i>astronomical</i>, and no amount of complaining from people who find Haskell hard to grok is going to stop us using it.  (Drink the Koolaide, my friend, drink it up!)  I think it is uncontroversial that this be true for research mathematics, but of course we don&#x27;t want to just throw students in the deep end, which is why the education system attempts to build this knowledge gradually, which leads me to...<p>2) More practically, I think most peoples&#x27; problems learning mathematics come from (if you&#x27;ll forgive a mathematical metaphor!) the person being out of phase with the material.  This is subtler than what Grovulent described.  Excellent material exists for all stages of one&#x27;s mathematical development, of this I am certain; the hard part is ensuring that one is using material that is hard enough to be challenging, but not so hard as to be crushingly incomprehensible.  This goes for people doing research in mathematics as well as people being introduced to calculus for the first time, and is <i>very</i> difficult to know when you are the student in question.  We generally rely on the education system and expert advice to match students to the appropriate material, and clearly the system doesn&#x27;t always work very well given how many people are out-of-phase with the material in front of them.  In general, most mathematicians love talking about mathematics, and the love teaching it too!  They love helping people understand and appreciate this marvel of human ingenuity.  Just browse Math.SE[2] and Mathoverflow[3] for a while if you don&#x27;t believe me.<p>3) Finally, an additional element is that many people expect to be able to learn mathematics quite easily without much or any deep reflection, because that&#x27;s how they&#x27;ve always learned things in the past.  But you simply can&#x27;t learn mathematics like that, and you&#x27;ll be disappointed and frustrated if you try to.  (I certainly concede that mathematicians could do a better job of warning students about this.)  Learning mathematics involves being in an almost constant state of uncertainty, and of making many, many mistakes, often in front of many other people, and <i>being comfortable with all that</i>.  This is a state of affairs that many people find disconcerting, and there&#x27;s nothing mathematicians can do about that bar suggesting that the student chill out and try not to let their ego get in the way of their education.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7997422"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7997422</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://math.stackexchange.com</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://mathoverflow.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mathoverflow.net</a>",1404726514

JSON maps much more naturally to an object model in a given language.  That&#x27;s just one way that by example you can show JSON, and know what you need to make.<p>Not to mention, XML is much more verbose, and when you wrap it in things like ws*/SOAP it gets really ugly really quickly, and if you don&#x27;t map everything, it gets complicated and often fails.  When you publish a service using one toolkit, it&#x27;s often difficult to use the service in another toolkit (example, using Java services in .Net gets really painful at times).  Unless a lot of detail is done, or an API client in that client&#x27;s environment is provided.<p>This isn&#x27;t about XML specifically but about the environment it tends to create.

MonoDevelop is a remarkably great IDE for something with so few users, for example, and great open source like Dapper and ServiceStack.OrmLite make it super easy for us to interface with Postgres and use all of Postgres&#x27;s unique features (Json as a first class data type, multiple-cursor result sets, stuff like that).<p>The author seems to propose &quot;get all the free Microsoft goodies when you start, and once you really need the paid versions you&#x27;re probably successful enough that the cost doesn&#x27;t matter much&quot;. It is Microsoft&#x27;s strategy that companies do this, and it&#x27;s a valid one, but it&#x27;s really not what I would do. Microsoft might&#x27;ve become a whole lot more open these days, but tying yourself in so much with a single provider sounds, well, dangerous no matter what.<p>For example, if you develop your C# app for Azure, moving to a different provider is a lot of work (much like if you want to move your Rails app away from Heroku, but with less open source out there to ease the road). If you develop your C# app to work platform-independent (or at least cloud-provider-independent) from the outset, then you&#x27;re free to move whenever you want.",1404725302

Spent most evenings coding what I could and making things that were useful at least in theory (ridesharing web app, etc.)\n* Got a terrible job at a content farm in LA (not the one you&#x27;re thinking of) working in ad trafficking. Took a pay cut to do it. Made a lot of tools with the the Google DART API in Java saving the company hundreds of thousands, which meant they were willing to let me continue on these wacky side projects.\n* Got another job as a Technical Account Manager based on my work in HTML/CSS/JS and Java. Product flopped, but the experience was great. Learned Python and Django while I was at it\n* Moved to Ireland on a lark on a working holiday visa\n* Got a tech support position at a domain registry (not registrar). Stagnated a bit since nothing was going on yet without any domains being released, but practiced while I could, in particular brushing up on network knowledge\n* Was recruited by and accepted a position at a PaaS company in Dublin as a support engineer, at roughly triple the salary I was at in LA. I spend most of my days working with iOS, Android, and Unity SDK&#x27;s. I do a lot of debugging by trawling through logs.

This project will be your portfolio. Make sure you know at least the basic syntax of those 5 languages so you know which will suit you best.<p>After you have your portfolio project, you can be confident in applying for a job, if you picked one of the first 3 languages you might want to move to a big city like Munchen or Berlin that has lots of young companies to improve your prospects.<p>The key to being a good programmer in my opinion is to know about as many techniques and solutions as possible. This is why even during your process of learning your primary language and acquiring your first job, you should allow yourself to be distracted by fancy techniques and impractical languages. Learn languages like Haskell, Lisp, Erlang, C, don&#x27;t become proficient in them, just enough to understand why they exist and why people love them, perhaps pick one of them up as your secondary language.<p>Also read a few of the good books you would get to read if you had done a university. IMO read &quot;Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach&quot; by Kurose, and &quot;Operating System Concepts&quot; by Silberschatz. Unlike most CS books these are very practical and easy to read. If you&#x27;d really like some more heady stuff, try &quot;Computer Algorithms&quot; by Van Gelder. Although it&#x27;s sort of out of fashion I think I have to recommend &quot;Design Patterns&quot; by Gamma (gang of four) as well.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m an optimist, but I think if you&#x27;re focused you could do all these things in under 6 months. And you would have made a great start as a programmer. On a university you&#x27;d spend at least 3 years doing this, 3 years you could also spend getting real experience, making a living and perhaps start a family. In my opinion that would be a waste. If you really aspire for a degree, why not do it when you retire? Also if you must study now, consider a Fachhochschule, as it would focus more on coding than on maths and other side acts of CS.<p>Good luck, and if you need more book recommendations send me a message.",1404725229

It&#x27;s likely, if you have any measure of success or you go down the investment route, that you&#x27;ll be expanding your technical team quite early. The availability and cost of developers is critical at the beginning. Building in languages like PHP, JS, Java, and to a lesser extend Perl and Python, means you have access to lots of cheap devs. Especially in the case of PHP and JS. Those languages will scale reasonably well to the tens of thousands of users, by which time you&#x27;ll probably be raising a Series A and you&#x27;ll be able to afford to shift the important bits of the code to a more appropriate language.<p>While it might be &#x27;right&#x27; to build in C# or Erlang or Haskell or Brainfuck or whatever, if you have to pay a premium to get your first engineer you&#x27;ll be shortening your runway, and that&#x27;s pretty much the worst thing you can do.

You&#x27;ll learn a lot in the process, and it will serve as a proof that you&#x27;re capable and not a bullshitter to potential employers.",1404723965

The fact is being good at making software is about 20% actual coding ability, and 80% being diligent and organised, communicating with other people, and willingness to trudge through boring tasks like writing documentation and attending meetings. Faced with two candidates, one of whom is all &quot;I love coding and I don&#x27;t sleep if I&#x27;m working on something!&quot; and the other who is &quot;I like coding, but I put it to one side in the evenings to socialise, watch movies, read books&quot; it&#x27;ll be the second candidate who gets the job <i>every single time</i>.<p>If you want to get your first (or second, whatever) job writing software concentrate more on the &#x27;getting a job&#x27; part than the &#x27;writing software&#x27; part. Demonstrate skills that will show you&#x27;re a person who is nice to be around.

Some of them will be key figures from financial statements (P&L/BS/CF).  Others will be financial ratios.  Others will be specific to the types of business they invest in (e.g. ARPPU if they&#x27;re investing in SaaS businesses).  Still others will be non-financial (e.g. headcount grouped by function, change from the previous month in each function, overall staff turnover).<p>Once you are close to firming up your business model, having a financial plan, and tracking progress against it every month, is really useful.",1404723649

It just won&#x27;t happen. The 3D hardware industry always adds new things, it&#x27;s impossible to keep up unless you had engineers working tightly with nvidia or AMD.<p>So drop the support of high end 3D features, only keep the core ones that have been working for a long time (do you really need that shader ?), focus on other basic things (like scriptability and other libraries, there is so much stuff to put in a game engine), and deliver a working 3D engine that is easy to use and program with. I don&#x27;t think any small developer who wants to release on linux can really compete with AAA, high end graphics titles. The only possible way to compete is to bring something new in term of gameplay, stop focusing on the graphics and the bells and whistles, it just won&#x27;t happen.<p>TLDR:<p>gaming is obviously anti competitive if you want to release on linux. what to do: don&#x27;t try to compete with what other games have already done, and focus on things that are doable and have been done well for a long time. There are many existing game concept that could be improved if you stop wasting time on the graphics. Having basic 3D rendering is already awesome in itself.",1421157322

While the former obviously covers what might be a kind of universal religious instinct, it does much much more. For instance, I don&#x27;t think believing in God is the same as believing in the existence of ghosts, or in immaterial spirits. It should even be the same verb. A man of faith is not only believing in the existence of God, and that His words are in a Book, he is also his whole life a consequence of this belief. If you really believe in God, you should be working very hard to be a Saint. Every second of your life you are not climbing this path is a misstep.<p>In the Far East religions, you have most pieces of the jigsaw present: mysticism, the Sacred, priests, monks, prayers, meditation, afterlife, etc. But I think the central piece of a unique almighty exclusive God is missing, and then the result is completely different.<p>There is also this theory that the Far East did not have a powerful scientific revolution because of this missing piece: Without a God who created everything, there is less incentive to believe in a unique ordering of things (the Law of physics) and to try to discover it.<p>And no, Confucius is not a prophet, he made no miracles, he did not announce anything. He was just a failed political advisor who became the teacher of a few disciples. However, he proposed a very rational and revolutionary way of life, under the disguise of restoring the ancient Way.

In the huge majority of cases, the following will get a computer back up and sorted in a sensible amount of (billable) time:<p>First, bring known-good copies of AdwCleaner, Junkware Removal Tool, RKill and ComboFix on a thumb drive. Same-day downloads are preferred as some detect out-of-date versions and don&#x27;t play nice. Shut down computer. Restart in safe mode with command prompt. Run explorer.exe from command prompt. USB typically works as usual, even in safe mode. Run each of the applications above as administrator in the order they are listed. Some will require a reboot to complete their work. The reboot should be in normal mode, subsequent restart(s) to run other cleaner(s) should be in safe mode with command prompt. Diminishing returns will take place after the third of fourth cleaner, and allow 15 minutes for a typical infection.<p>The longest it&#x27;s taken me to completely clean a computer of was 7 hours, comprising around 18GB of tat. If it&#x27;s a severe infection, I will recommend a rebuild from known-good factory media after a Windows Easy Transfer export, assuming there&#x27;s not too much in the way of user content.<p>As an up-sell, I also offer a better-than-factory reset where there&#x27;s a clean Windows 7 installed and no vendor-specific junk on there. Computer vendors aren&#x27;t as bad as free-to-use software vendors, but there&#x27;s a reason why a adequate Lenovo laptop can be bought in the UK for 230GBP (including sales tax at 20%).

8879530,comment,8876445,8877932,0,0,dctoedt,,,"> <i>Love to tell my horror story re: my experience dealing with a Fortune 50 company.</i><p>A couple of points:<p>1.  Obviously this is very different from pitching to an angel investor or venture capitalist, who might be unlikely to care about your secret technology.  As you discovered, it&#x27;s entirely possible that BigCo&#x27;s engineers were very interested in learning what you were doing so they could do likewise, ideally without having to pay you anything.<p>2.  Courts will sometimes enforce trade-secret rights even without a written NDA, if the circumstances were such that the party receiving the information implicitly agreed to keep the information in confidence.  But that can be a really tricky proposition to prove, and will vary with the jurisdiction.<p>3.  A written NDA might or might not be of much value in a situation like this.<p>A)  BigCo might not want to sign an NDA.  That&#x27;s a red flag right there, of course.  BigCo might even want you to sign an agreement saying that anything you say to them is <i>not</i> confidential (this is not uncommon, because big companies get a lot of idea submitted &quot;over the transom&quot; and don&#x27;t want to have to deal with lawsuits from cranks who re-invented the wheel).<p>B) NDAs usually have carve-outs that say that &quot;Confidential Information&quot; doesn&#x27;t include information that was published or otherwise known to others before disclosure (or that becomes such afterwards).   BUT:  Under U.S. law, a specific selection or combination of individual pieces of public information can be protectable, just as Kentucky Fried Chicken&#x27;s secret blend of 11 herbs and spices is (reportedly) protected as a trade secret.<p>C) You want to be careful to comply with any requirement in the NDA that confidential information must be disclosed or summarized in a writing that&#x27;s marked &quot;Confidential&quot; or &quot;Subject to Nondisclosure Agreement&quot; or something like that, on pain of losing protection.  For example, in the <i>Convolve v. Compaq</i> case, the computer manufacturer Compaq (now part of Hewlett-Packard) defeated a claim of misappropriation of trade secrets concerning hard-disk technology because the owner of the putative trade-secret information didn&#x27;t follow up its oral disclosures with written summaries as required by the parties&#x27; non-disclosure agreement. [1]<p>D) Enforcing an NDA can take a lot of time and money, especially if BigCo is convinced they haven&#x27;t done anything wrong.  On the other hand, sometimes it can pay off, because a jury might well punish a company that it found violated an NDA.  See, e.g., the 1996 case of <i>Celeritas Technologies v. Rockwell International</i>, where a federal-court jury in Los Angeles awarded a startup more than $57 million, and the judge then added $900,000 in attorneys&#x27; fees, because the jury found that Rockwell had breached an NDA. [2]<p>4.  Suggestion:  Even for non-secret information, an NDA might be negotiated to include the equivalent of a break-up fee.  That is, even if it turns out that the secret technology wasn&#x27;t a secret after all, <i>but the receiving party didn&#x27;t know the technology</i>, then the receiving party might be required to pay the disclosing party something as payment for &quot;show-how&quot; (as distinct from know-how), in return for having taught the receiving party about the information, thereby saving the receiving party from the time and expense of having to find out the information on its own.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/12-1074.Opinion.6-27-2013.1.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16810614390244449913"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1681061439024444...</a>.

This is not Islam.<p>But, if I were to take the liberty to express my own opinion, I would say honestly, I think both parties were at wrong here. First that their have been many instances in the life of our prophet, when he faced not just harsh but inhuman treatment, specially in his hometown of Mecca. Yet he never lifted a finger or even wished for those people to get hurt (there is specific mention of this in Islam). It is against the moral of our religion to engage in such &quot;eye for an eye&quot; notions. Yet people (like the 4 suspects) who are not aware of their own religion and the finer lines tend to do these things when agitated or pushed in a corner.<p>On the other hand, Religion is a personal affair. People are serious about it, be it any religion. People live and die by the religion, it is the very guide of majority of the people in this world. And if someone portrays something so closely associated to people, it is a kin to playing with their feelings. And that is where things start to get ugly, and such mishaps happen.<p>Satire is accepted in Islam, as evident from the semi-fictional writings about Mullah Nasruddin.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasreddin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasreddin</a><p>But the level of Satire in question here, was perhaps too much. Besides the additional fact, that impersonation/impersonification of Prophet Muhammad is highly condemned in Islam. Even if we are to write a play on factual things about him, it is prohibited to have someone portray him (even for a good/just reason). To say that in other words, to Muslims, a graphical satire is acceptable on anyone except the prophets, which includes Moses, Jesus, Abraham, etc. Yet, if someone does want to amuse himself or exercise his liberty knowing that it is something that hurts us, we simply have to ignore him. Things should not go further than that.<p>People in the west have indeed respected this, as seen in the movie:<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074896/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074896/</a><p>Let us understand each others liberties as well as sensitivities, so that by standing firm together, we will all make a better society, both in France and the World.",1421154796

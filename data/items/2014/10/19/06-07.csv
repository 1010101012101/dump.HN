I wish all countries had such laws.<p>That said, I think it&#x27;s a bit short-sighted to say that maternity leave is a &quot;special privilege&quot; for women.  Women are the only ones (so far as I know) who can have children, and we do (I think) want to encourage employees to have them.<p>Maternity leave isn&#x27;t a special privilege.

It seems like a great way for companies to force young women to work harder and put their family plans on hold, in favor of the company.  I can easily imagine a situation in which this benefit will be used to force women to choose between advancing their careers (&quot;why not freeze your eggs, and have children later?&quot;) and starting or expanding a family.<p>Part of the problem here would seem to be that the US still lags behind the rest of the world in maternity leave.  If the government were to mandate that companies let women take off from work, and then return to their jobs without penalty, it would result in a level playing field, and a sense (among women) that they don&#x27;t have to choose.<p>Actually, that&#x27;s not entirely true: In Israel, where I live, there is government-mandated maternity leave with decent benefits, and women still find it hard to compete.  It&#x27;s not unusual for potential employers to (illegally) ask women how old they are, when they plan to have children, or how many children they plan to have.  So even with such a benefit in place, things are still tough for women in the workplace.<p>I should add that I&#x27;m male and the owner of a small (currently 3-person) company.

8477375,comment,8476476,8476476,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Interestingly, arsenic has long been suspected of being an essential nutrient in mammalian biology. There are wasting diseases that are nominally caused by extreme arsenic deficiency and adding arsenic to animal feed in certain regions of the world (presumably with extremely low environmental arsenic levels) has been practiced because it increases animal weight and fertility. And fact is, in some parts of the world (including some regions of the US), extremely high natural arsenic levels in the water and environment exist at several times the EPA maximum designated levels with no obvious adverse consequences. I do not think there is any rigorous scientific evidence for acquired tolerance but it is a possibility; at a minimum, populations living in naturally very high arsenic environments don&#x27;t seem to accumulate notable pathologies as a result.<p>The old saying that &quot;the dose makes the poison&quot; probably applies here, and bioavailability of the arsenic forms probably plays a role. However, the line from poison to harmless is rarely straight and in many cases is bimodal i.e. too little is as bad as too much. Many common vitamins have a similar toxicity curve. Even alcohol consumption has a bimodal distribution in terms of its effects on mortality. Arsenic having a bimodal toxicity would not be surprising, even though it is presumed to be linear by the EPA. It would be somewhat surprising to learn that a high degree of tolerance can be developed but not unprecedented.<p>An alternative hypothesis is that arsenic bioavailability varies considerably. What may be interpreted as tolerance is actually a circumstantial lack of bioavailability. There is scientific evidence lending credence to the idea of incredibly low bioavailability of dietary arsenic in some cases such that it might be possible to consume large quantities without actually absorbing it. Some plants are known to be aggressive concentrators of environmental arsenic without being particularly toxic to critters that eat them. In some contexts most of the arsenic may go in one end and out the other.<p>Arsenic is quite interesting from a biochemistry perspective. It can be extremely toxic, which is well understood, but the variability and the effects in lower doses is not. Plenty of interesting research still to be done.",1413698833

Humans are naturally prone to pareidolia and the pathetic fallacy - we see faces in potato chips, we convince ourselves that a faulty photocopier hates us, we attribute personality traits to automobiles.<p>Looking back to the 1960s, many people experienced strong emotions when interacting with ELIZA, a program that is laughably simple by modern standards. Today, there are numerous accounts of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan holding funerals for bomb disposal robots and decorating them with honorary medals.<p>Machines don&#x27;t need to be as intelligent as humans for us to begin forming deep attachments to them, they don&#x27;t need to pass the Turing test, they don&#x27;t even need to match the intelligence of a cat or dog - they only need to <i>appear</i> plausibly sentient, which I think is a far lower bar than most of us realise.<p>Personally, I think we&#x27;re on the cusp of a profound change in how we interact with computers.

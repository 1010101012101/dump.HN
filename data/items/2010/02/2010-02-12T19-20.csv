If it's the government, then you must use strong cryptography no matter where you host your email, and you must ensure that everyone you communicate with is as paranoid as you.  (I would encrypt all my email, but nobody else I talk too will.  So it doesn't work.)  If it's advertisers you want to avoid, just run your own server and stop worrying so much.  People have been doing it for years.<p>(Although, I run my own mailserver and am inundated with spam.  Thousands of messages a day.  So you aren't really avoiding advertisements, you are just avoiding advertisements for stuff you might actually want :)",1266004793

I've made it a policy to pretty much just ignore anybody from the moment they start a sentence with ""When I went to <insert specific school>..."". It could be a top-10 school, or it could be some Tier-3 school. Unless the point is hyper-specific to that school, the school is really immaterial to the point.<p>Coincidentally when a school <i>is</i> named in a sentence like that it's almost always a top-10 US school. This is a common phenomenon for these schools.<p>I did some quick spot checking just to make sure I wasn't suffering from some kind of confirmation bias...<p>According to Google the phrase ""What I was at <insert school>"" occurs with the following frequencies:<p>School - Google Returns - US News Ranking<p>Harvard - 2,280,000 - 1<p>Columbia - 1,300,000 - 8<p>Yale - 976,000 - 3<p>Stanford - 962,000 - 4<p>Princeton - 651,000 - 1<p>MIT - 607,000 - 4<p>Duke - 553,000 - 10<p>Brown - 485,000 - 16<p>Cornell - 418,000 - 15<p>Compare to Tier-3 schools with large student populations<p>KSU - 91,300<p>Biola - 56,800<p>DePaul - 45,200<p>UVA - 45,600<p>Some of the schools barely register at all, even reasonably notable ones.

Of the top of my head, I can think of three different distributed message hashing services (Razor, Pyzor, and DCC) that function similar to a shared Bayesian filter, not to mention all the various IP and URI blacklists that collect and share data about bad actors.  I've actually done mail server installs where I've turned <i>off</i> the local bayes filters to improve results because they were getting confused by low volumes.<p>SpamAssassin comes with just about every Linux distribution and is used by major ISPs, so you're not ""going it alone,"" you're leveraging what a huge percentage of the internet population is already using.<p>It's not without effort (maybe 15-30 minutes/week of tweaking when something slips through), but my personal email setup gives me as good or better results than my infrequently-used Gmail account.",1266004554

Be apart of the internet and give up all hope of privacy, or don't participate and be a Luddite.  This choice is not acceptable or practical for any future.<p>Google grossly underestimated how important privacy has become to average user in last year or two.  Unfortunately this could have been the killer feature that Buzz could leverage over Facebook and Twitter because they do such a horrible job at it.  In fact Facebook's take on privacy has become down right scary.  Privacy controls for Buzz could have been it's differentiator.  Instead it's turned into the killer mistake threatening to bury Buzz before it even got out of the gate.<p>But, everyone screws up, everyone makes mistakes, it's all about how fast they fix it.

The other W3C standards remain partially (or incorrectly) unimplemented so they're effectively not standards anyway.<p>The innovation on the web has always begun with the code -- and always with proprietary solutions.  The best of these solutions are eventually implemented by everyone and that becomes the standard.  Netscape added images, tables, and plugins.  IE added events on all DOM elements, xmlHttpRequest, and so on.  Different browsers are now beginning to implement ""HTML5"" features.  When all the browsers reach some level of common usefulness then W3C or WHATWG will fit their standard around what's in common usage and call it HTML5.<p>Having big committees make big plans has never worked for the web.",1266001420

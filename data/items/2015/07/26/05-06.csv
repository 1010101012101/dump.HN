9950308,comment,9948206,9950032,0,0,thinkpad20,,,"I&#x27;m having a tough time trying to understand what you&#x27;re proposing. First of all, in Haskell there&#x27;s no real concept of having functions &quot;attached&quot; to objects (in the OO sense). The closest analogue is a <i>type class</i>, which relates a type to a set of functions. For monad, that looks like<p><pre><code>    class Monad m where\n      return :: a -> m a\n      (>>=)  :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b\n</code></pre>\nAnd it&#x27;s up to the particular <i>instance</i> to determine how those functions are implemented. For example,<p><pre><code>    instance Monad Maybe where\n      return :: a -> Maybe a\n      return x = Just x\n\n      (>>=) :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b\n      maybe >>= f = case maybe of \n        Nothing -> Nothing\n        Just x -> f x\n</code></pre>\nThe definition of the State type, and its corresponding Monad instance, is a little more involved (I suggest this blog post for an explanation [1]):<p><pre><code>    newtype State s a = State { runState :: s -> (a, s) }\n\n    instance Monad (State a) where\n    return x = State $ \s -> (x, s)\n    m >>= k = State $ \s -> let (a, s&#x27;) = runState m s\n                            in runState (k a) s&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m honestly not quite sure what you mean by the rest of it (for example, &quot;ignoring the function requirement&quot;, &quot;specialness&quot; etc). But the bottom line is that you can do <i>any</i> typesafe thing you want to, within the rules of how the language works.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://brandon.si/code/the-state-monad-a-tutorial-for-the-confused/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brandon.si/code/the-state-monad-a-tutorial-for-the-co...</a>",1437890327

This is fine for the experienced HW person, but not for the beginner. In other words, the HLS is better for the experienced HW designer than the beginner even though it looks like its easy.<p>Unfortunately there is no infrastructure for you to build onto. It&#x27;s like a blank slate. All the I/O needs to be done right. It&#x27;s very seldom just instantiating wires unless your design is blazingly simple. And if it were simple you wouldn&#x27;t need an FPGA in the first place. A generic coprocessor would kick most FPGAs butts.",1437890248

Erik Rhoads. I asked why his officers hadn’t contacted management before they raided the apartment. Why did they classify the incident as a forced entry, when the information they had suggested something innocuous? Why not evaluate the situation before escalating it?<p>> Rhoads defended the procedure, calling the officers’ actions “on point.” It’s not standard to conduct investigations beforehand because that delays the apprehension of suspects, he told me.<p>Yeah, given how they reacted in this article and the fact they defended not even bothering to contact the apartment complex...yeah.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m not really able to believe that. Its pretty clear this procedure exists to pad some kind of statistic rather than any rational cause. It can&#x27;t be justified outside of that.<p>&quot;Does the property owner know about this?&quot; is literally the first question worth asking if you cared about not shooting innocent people.",1437887103
9950195,comment,9949859,9949859,0,0,HelloMcFly,,,"I try to make the case like this in my organization (and have in my previous one as well): we can easily quantify the <i>enormous</i> amount of money - particularly but far from exclusively the financial value of time - we spend on our performance review process. But what we don&#x27;t really know, and what very few organizations really know (because &quot;performance&quot; is usually a very troublesome criterion) is what value that process is delivering back to the organization.<p>One of the problems is that most organizations want their process to &quot;Do It All.&quot; They want it to be development for the employee while also being the primary determinant of administrative decisions. Further, they want it to support <i>all</i> administrative decisions: who&#x27;s great at their current job, who is most capable of succeeding in their next job (i.e., who should we promote?), how should we distribute our pay raises, what do we do with this year&#x27;s STI and LTI, etc.<p>It&#x27;s broken, and expensive. Maybe it can&#x27;t truly be fixed, but at least we can save some money, time, and frustration. That doesn&#x27;t mean nobody gets feedback, or that we don&#x27;t set and track goals. But it doesn&#x27;t have to be the way we make it. If we put half as much effort into making managers better at leading people I have no doubt the impact would be much more clear.",1437887069

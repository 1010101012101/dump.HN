</code></pre>
Here, `over` is <i>not</i> a string. This is not stringly typed programming. It translates to<p><pre><code>    over (location.x) (+ 10) $ player1
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s used to take a function that would normally be<p><pre><code>    function_name argument1 argument2
</code></pre>
and allow you to call it like so<p><pre><code>    argument1 `function_name` argument2
</code></pre>
so<p><pre><code>    plus 1 2 = 1 `plus` 2
</code></pre>
There&#x27;s nothing special you need to do, and it&#x27;s purely a style thing. Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to read.<p>Edit - fix from DanWaterworth, the . in location.x is (if I understand the problem correctly) function composition and therefore location.x is location . x, so my re-ordering possibly changed things more than I thought. The principle is the same, but I&#x27;ve wrapped location.x in parentheses, just to be sure. I&#x27;m sure someone more well versed in haskell can correct me on this :)",1374487194

But any half-decent should be immune to this (there are billions of SIMs, and here it&#x27;s &quot;millions&quot; only vulnerable).<p>First, in a proper network the mobile device and the network mutually authenticate themselves. So the cell can&#x27;t be faked. Then it&#x27;s very easy for the network to filter such management SMS and only allow them from their trusted server. It&#x27;s a very basic security precaution.

6082789,comment,6082582,6082582,24,0,moocowduckquack,,,"&quot;Dear All,<p>I am emailing to ask for some specific action which the prime minister plans to announce shortly. This follows a meeting yesterday at No 10 yesterday to discuss a range of child internet safety issues including parental controls and filters. The prime minister would like to make some further specific requests of industry and his office have asked us to ask you when you could deliver the following actions.<p>1. Implementing browser intercept<p>I understand that Talk Talk will be trialling a &quot;browser intercept&quot; to force existing customers to choose either to proceed with parental controls (pre-ticked), choose their own settings or turn them off completely. The prime minister wants to announce that by the end of the year, every household with a broadband internet connection will have had to make a decision to &quot;opt-out&quot; of installing filters. Will the other three ISPs consider making a commitment to adopting this approach - even before it has been trialled?<p>2. Age-verification systems/closed-loop<p>The prime minister expects customers to be required to prove their age/identity before any changes to the filters are made. I understand that you will all be implementing &quot;closed-loop&quot; systems which will notify account holders of any changes that are made to the filters and that you have robust systems in place but please could you all confirm the precise information that is required to enable customer to access, set-up and change their filters?<p>3. Awareness campaign for parents<p>I understand that it was agreed at Claire Perry&#x27;s meeting a few weeks ago that Talk Talk, BT and others would undertake some further research to establish what the focus of the campaign should be. The prime minister would like to be able to announce a collective financial commitment from industry to fund this campaign. I know that it will be challenging for you to commit to an unknown campaign but please can you indicate what sum you will pledge to this work that the PM can announce.<p>4. Using the phrase &quot;default-on&quot; instead of &quot;active-choice +&quot;<p>The prime minister believes that there is much more that we can all do to improve how we communicate the current position on parental internet controls and that there is a need for a simplified message to reassure parents and the public more generally. Without changing what you will be offering (ie active-choice +), the prime minister would like to be able to refer to your solutions are &quot;default-on&quot; as people will have to make a choice not to have the filters (by unticking the box). Can you consider how to include this language (or similar) in the screens that begin the set-up process? For example, &quot;this connection includes family-friendly filters as default [or as standard] - if you do not want to install this protection please un-tick the box&quot; (obviously not intended to be drafting). Would you be able to commit to including &quot;default-on&quot; or similar language both in the set-up screen and public messaging?<p>We are all aware of the really excellent work that you are doing and but there are a number of specific areas that the prime minister thinks need further immediate action. You are likely to receive a further message from colleagues in DCMS and the Home Office regarding tackling illegal images but given the short deadline for this work we thought it better to give you some time to work on these issues in the meantime. I need to report back to No 10 by the end of the week on these points so I would be grateful if you could consider this request as a matter of urgency and respond by midday Friday.<p>Apologies for the very tight deadline and grateful for your help with this work.&quot;<p>They should have signed it &quot;Sir Humphrey Appleby&quot;.",1374486991

Max/MSP-style languages (I&#x27;ve played with Synthmaker and a few others too) have a few major advantages over traditional text-based languages, especially for exploratory programming or prototyping (and the main problem I see cited for these languages is that code quickly devolves into a mess of lines - literal spaghetti code - but I found that with proper software engineering principles this hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me, just most users are not trained software engineers). One thing that really jumped out at me is that how not having to name things until you&#x27;re good and ready (because you can simply connect stuff visually without naming or labeling) means you can focus on designing the code and experimenting rather than trying to come up with names for things as you are forced to do in most text-based languages.

With SSL, ports don&#x27;t matter, because you <i>can&#x27;t run</i> mutually-untrustworthy services on the same domain using SSL. So, with or without SSL, ports don&#x27;t matter.<p>Here, let me show my work:<p>1. All these cross-origin protections the browser uses are basically entirely meaningless without SSL, because you&#x27;re talking to an unathenticated counterparty. So you&#x27;ve got to assume site A is using SSL+HSTS before a conversation about cross-origin protection even becomes coherent. You&#x27;ve also got to assume that, since site A is using HSTS, site B has to attack it by running SSL as well.<p>2. Now, <i>with</i> SSL, you can&#x27;t <i>have</i> two separate sites on the same domain unless they&#x27;re mutually-trusting, because they would need to share the same cert--and thus both have copies of the private key used to generate that cert. (Unless a CA screwed up and double-issued a cert, that is.) So you have to assume the attacker is now on a separate domain (or using a self-signed cert) for the conversation about cross-origin protection to <i>retain</i> coherency.<p>3. Disallow connections to sites with self-signed certs. (Browsers already do this.)<p>4. Do all the cross-origin protection stuff--like not sending cookies--when the domain is different. (Browsers already do this.)<p>5. You&#x27;re done, because the previous assumptions simplified the problem.<p>Your browser&#x27;s SSL logic, combined with CAs&#x27; certificate-signing policies, have effectively protected you from talking to anything running on the same domain as site A, which doesn&#x27;t also use the cert site A uses. Everything left is either mutually-trustworthy (that is, has access to site A&#x27;s SSL private key), or has managed to break your SSL stack somewhere--in which case, we&#x27;re back to the &quot;you&#x27;re screwed because you&#x27;re talking to an unauthenticated counterparty&quot; problem.",1374485860

6082614,comment,6079428,6081664,3,0,Sanddancer,,,"The gauge breaks are probably a rather significant part of that. Having to offload the cargo, move it to a different set of tracks, load it back up, and then repeat at the other end of the broad gauge tracks adds up to a rather large amount of time. I imagine you could probably shave off at least a day or two if you didn&#x27;t have to deal with that part of the issue. Furthermore, there are almost certainly a number of places where you&#x27;ll have to decouple and recouple the cars to a new locomotive when you cross country borders for various nationalistic and tractive reasons. Finally, you have to factor in time spent during crew breaks, crew changes, fueling the train, etc.<p>To speed things up, you&#x27;d need to convince the former soviet republics that going to standard gauge is a good investment for increasing trade in and through their countries. Additionally, you&#x27;d need to convince various nations to sign trackage rights and operation rights agreements so you don&#x27;t need to change locomotives at every border. After all that, then you can start worrying about customs agreements, which would not be that significant of a delay compared to all the other logistics of transporting things over long stretches of rail. It&#x27;s just time consuming almost by definition.",1374483705

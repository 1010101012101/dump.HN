Its similar to the distinction between installing Xen yourself on a dedicated server versus using a VPS provider.<p>I am actually working on a service where you can easily deploy VPSs that have Docker installed on them with a control panel for conveniently managing the containers.  I can then have features like a menu option to move containers between VMs and automatically creating DNS and proxy configuration for container-based virtual hosting.  I.e. you click a button on the container and just type in the sub domain or domain name next to the public port exposed by Docker and then that gets automatically set up so you can access that service on that container through a domain name.",1383645539

Now free services for life doesn&#x27;t seem like such a good deal, because the terms are that they owe you nothing and life may equal 2 months, 1 year or 10, it&#x27;s impossible to know.<p>I didn&#x27;t use Reader or participate in the Reader drama and feel it&#x27;s a bit over-egged, but there is certainly a reputational cost to closing mainstream services or modifying them without consulting those who use them as Apple, FB, MS, Google, Twitter et al do regularly. This doesn&#x27;t really apply if you have 10 users, but if you have 10 million and an ecosystem it can become important.<p>Building on top of these platforms like FB or G+ is in my opinion very risk for other businesses, so depending on something like helpouts is a huge risk for the people who might use it to actually sell/provide services and build a reputation, but very little short-term risk for Google.",1383645271

This page explains why:&quot;<p>http://ycombinator.com/whynot.html<p>I have read and understand the reasons stated for not being able to offer feedback, and I understand that YC owes nothing to applicants. However, the explanation offered does not fully support the claim that it can&#x27;t provide feedback to applicants.<p>The reason boils down to &quot;there often is no reason&quot;. Which implies that sometimes there is a reason.<p>Similarly: &quot;From that cutoff down to about the halfway point, the applications are pretty good.&quot; Which implies that fully half of applications are not that good, presumably for reasons which could be easily identified.<p>Feedback options remaining which wouldn&#x27;t be precluded by the reasons stated include:\n1. Your group was/was not in the &quot;pretty good&quot; top 50% of applications\n2. Your group was rejected mainly because of ABC (or there was no clear reason/weakness, if that is the case)<p>I of course acknowledge it is the prerogative of YC to withhold feedback for any reasons they choose, and they have no obligation to share that publicly. But if they choose to make those reasons public, it is reasonable to expect them to contain sound logic.<p>We appreciate that the YC team is very busy. It seems that they have already done the heavy lifting of evaluating applicants, but perhaps distilling that into feedback would be a substantial effort. I can&#x27;t make the judgement of whether it is in their best interest to give feedback when possible, but I suspect I am not alone in believing that any feedback would be beneficial and much appreciated.

From there you get to know that email address X uses password Y, which may open the door for hacking into other accounts where they&#x27;ve used the same passwords.<p>The people that get fucked over first from a DB leak of hashed passwords are those with weak passwords. A poor hashing algorithm (unsalted MD5, etc) may even expose seemingly &quot;unguessable/random&quot; passwords thanks to rainbow tables.<p>Even with bcrypt() hashed passwords you should be able to work through a huge portion of the top 100 passwords for all 130M accounts and come out with a huge number of email/password pairs.<p>Increasing the work factor of the hashing algorithm is a trade off, too high and you&#x27;ll soon need extra servers just to cope with the extra CPU load of people logging in and having to check their passwords, too low and the hashes are easier to crack.<p>2) But, why not use bcrypt() to hash the passwords, and then some encryption algorithm to encrypt the resulting hashes?<p>Before anyone jumps in with it, doing this is not &quot;security by obscurity&quot; because you&#x27;re not relying on the encryption key remaining secret alone to protect the password.<p>What it does protect you from is a basic leak/dump of the DB being open access for those who want to try cracking the bcrypt() hashes.<p>They&#x27;re left with an initial problem of finding the encryption key before they can even start on the bcrypt() dictionary attack.<p>Sure it just takes someone to grab a copy of the login code (or wherever the encryption key is being stored) but you&#x27;ve protected yourself from a basic SQL injection attack that could be used to just dump the DB without access to the server to compromise the login code.<p>Also, hints:-<p>Why weren&#x27;t the hints encrypted? (Including having a random n character &#x27;salt&#x27; that is prefixed to them before encryption to prevent the same hints encrypting to the same string).<p>If the hints were encrypted you couldn&#x27;t use them to help guess passwords.<p>Even if the passwords were hashed rather than encrypted, the unencrypted treasure trove of password hints would make the job of cracking the passwords much much easier.<p>Why were the hints even stored in the same table (or even on the same server) as the passwords? (Maybe they weren&#x27;t and the hackers got both and combined the two datastores.)<p>Again, if the server was compromised enough that the source for the login code was obtained then the hints would effectively be in plaintext, but you&#x27;ve still protected the hint data from a simple DB dump hack.",1383644490

It would take a craftsman years to develop his craft.  Eventually though, power tools lifted a lot of the learning curve.  It became easier and faster to create furniture.  Eventually a lot of those power tools were replaced with automated CNC machines.  With these machines you can pretty much throw anyone from the street who can read on the machine.  Productivity has increased so much that you can pretty much buy furniture these days for not that much more than the cost of materials alone!  It really is an incredible statement.<p>Now not to take the metaphor to far.  I realize you can&#x27;t turn science into an industrial process... it is a creative process  as much as anything.

But technology is not quite there yet today.<p>Isn&#x27;t that time frame incredibly conservative? Think about how much technology has changed since 1983.

My roommate was a guy who had just joined ISRO - we graduated same year but from different colleges. And I also had a chance to interact closely with 2 other friends who were working with ISRO at that time (one was a senior in college).<p>His payscale started at Rs.8000 per month (in 2001 that was less than $200usd). He was a production engineer. He would be up for next revision of payscale & promotion pending a review in 4 years! He knew that.<p>I used to wonder what keeps them motivated and I used to constantly question them. One common thread you find based on these conversations is that they are extremely satisfied with work - each of them used to say that what they are working on is UNIQUE that nobody else in ISRO is responsible for. And buck stops with them. They knew that.<p>That sense of ownership and the way the employees connect to a much larger cause is something unbelievable at ISRO, in my perspective. I used to be in awe of every conversation about his superiors, the work and their perspective of the organization in general.<p>I think it is an interesting case study in organizational behavior and what keeps you motivated with factors other than just money.<p>Teaching is another profession I think requires similar mindset. ISRO somehow hires the right kind of people, the employees within the organization are not so flamboyant setting examples for new hires and helps them connect in a way it makes people see contribution to a bigger cause.<p>Just my observation from what I have seen from close quarters.<p>BTW, it is also given that he knew they get pension after retirement, medical benefits & all such taken care of for his entire life because he is part of the organization.<p>Would love to read if there are any case studies on this.",1383642884

6674051,comment,6668646,6671282,2,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> This article makes some good points but it&#x27;s missing a bit of history. The reference pixel is defined at 96dpi because that&#x27;s how Windows treated the screen in the days before high-dpi support. Mac OS treated the screen as 72dpi in the pre-retina days but most early websites were built to look correct on Windows. That&#x27;s why MS Office fonts look too small on the Mac to this day: 26% too small to be precise.<p>The only way I can understand this is backwards -- a Windows &quot;pixel&quot; is 1/96 of an inch. (?)  A Mac &quot;pixel&quot; is 1/72 of an inch; much larger.  Wouldn&#x27;t a windows font appear too <i>large</i> if displayed on a Mac?",1383642322

6674040,comment,6672372,6672372,5,0,URSpider94,,,"Ex-NYC landlord here. I&#x27;m glad to see how many people realize that re-rental of a rental property in a multi-tenant building is problematic.<p>NYC rentals are some of the most regulated in the country; nearly half of rentals are covered by rent stabilization law, which makes it all but impossible to evict tenants as long as they pay rent, and dictates annual rent increases regardless of the gap between current rent and fair market value. Rent-controlled tenants who rent out through AirBnB are, quite literally, rent-seeking -- using their government-granted preference in the housing market to extract a profit.<p>Beyond that, there are very real issues of security and disturbance of community when strangers are coming in and out of a property. My wife and I lived in our building, and it was like a little neighborhood. People left their boots and umbrellas in the hall on rainy days, and we had a communal BBQ grill in the backyard. If you haven&#x27;t lived in a super-dense city like London, NYC or Tokyo, it&#x27;s hard to understand how sacred the interior of an apartment building is.<p>One way to look at it is that AirBnB is &quot;disrupting&quot; the stale hotel industry. Another way to look at it is that hotel laws and regulations were put in place to put paid to the crush of illegal/dangerous/unhealthy boarding houses that cropped up near the turn of the last century. Stories like laxatives&#x27; make me fear that we are headed right back there.",1383642098

The long-term cost of reputation is perhaps something they&#x27;re only now starting to realise.<p>Whether it&#x27;s an acceptable risk for the users of these services is up to them, and many of them are deciding it is not, because these services can be so easily closed.

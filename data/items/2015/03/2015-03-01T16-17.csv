9127791,comment,9126190,9127536,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"All right, I think I agree with you on many points. Let me try to summarize my view here:<p>1. We can only see the effect of race on admission at a very coarse resolution, because universities try their hardest to obscure it.<p>2. Even at this coarse resolution, it&#x27;s easy to see that at most US universities, race has a massive effect. We see this by noting that when you break down admitted freshmen by race, they show very large group differences on all the characteristics that the universities will admit they&#x27;re looking for.<p>3. Although minority enrollment in the UC system dropped after Prop 209, we still see these large differences. As they are our only way of inferring any effect of race, we conclude that race still has large effects, despite the fact that this is now illegal. Ward Connerly will tell you any number of stories (well, write stories down that you can read) about other UC regents specifically plotting to subvert prop 209 and get minorities in by whatever pretexts they can think of.<p>4. We <i>fail</i> to observe significant differences among the racial groups at CalTech.<p>5. You are almost certainly correct to estimate that, since CalTech says it considers race, we should believe that it does consider race.<p>6. <i>But</i> I, personally, while admitting that in the sense of point (5) CalTech does consider race, still think that it&#x27;s usefully correct to go around telling people &quot;CalTech, unlike other US schools, doesn&#x27;t discriminate by race&quot;. This is because when we use our own metric, which is what we have to do for other schools, we can&#x27;t detect any discrimination on the part of CalTech. When we compare it to other schools, it seems reasonable to measure them all the same way.<p>Put another way, in the wise words of Cecil Adams, what we cannot reliably measure we are entitled to ignore. CalTech has information that we don&#x27;t, but until it makes a difference that we can see, there&#x27;s not much of a reason for us to pay attention. Comparing our view of UCLA with CalTech&#x27;s view of itself is terrible statistics.",1425229183

Establishing a maximum quota of Jewish or Asian students at a university is, factually, discrimination. It may be morally justifiable discrimination, but it is discrimination.<p>If the freshman class at Harvard University ends up being 30% Asian and 10% Jewish, maybe it&#x27;s because people in East Asian and Jewish cultures value education more than people in other cultures. In that case, why isn&#x27;t it fair for an educational institution to cater to individuals who have been raised to value education?<p>If some minorities (and let&#x27;s not dance around the issue; we mean black people) are underrepresented at these institutions, that is a wake up call.

The last Half-Life game was in 2007 (as was the last Team Fortress game). The last Portal game was 2011, and Kim Swift has moved on to other things. Left 4 Dead&#x27;s developers have moved to another publisher with Evolve. Counter-Strike is still limping along. Dota 2 exists, I guess. The only thing they&#x27;ve released since Dota 2 are Linux ports of old games, unless you count the ports of old games that Nvidia did to Android. Meanwhile the Steam Machine hasn&#x27;t seen commercial release, we still don&#x27;t even know what their Steam Controller is supposed to look like in its final form... and they&#x27;re announcing a VR headset? After all their big names in VR already jumped ship to Occulus? Is there an adult somewhere at Valve minding the store?",1425228580

HubSpot loves investing in Engineering as a way to build a world-class product.<p>On the front-end, we use technologies like CoffeeScript and React to create a wonderful experience for our users interacting with the system.<p>On the back-end, we use technologies like HBase, Kafka, MySQL, Elasticsearch, ZooKeeper, and Dropwizard.  If you haven&#x27;t looked at Dropwizard, it&#x27;s actually a really nice way to develop web services in Java: you can annotate paths like you would do in Python and Flask and just return a Java object that will be serialised into JSON for you by Jackson.<p>Engineering is organised into small teams (usually around 3 people) where you can have a big impact on the product.  We deploy hundreds of times per day and use GitHub Enterprise for SCM, Jenkins to build, and an internally developed open-source system built on top of Mesos called Singularity to deploy app instance containers.  Your changes won&#x27;t be languishing in git waiting for a major release.  Because deploys are so painless, we&#x27;re able to deploy small changes.<p>If Google&#x27;s catch-phrase is &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot; ours is &quot;use good judgement&quot;.

That&#x27;s the best thing about HubSpot: the people are great people that you can rely on, learn from, and have a great time getting things done with.",1425228297

That seems really heavy-handed.<p>Buildout requirements can be bad, in that they hold back an entire region to the least common denominator, but they can also be used as a bargaining chip to force service to regions that otherwise would never receive service at all.<p>Remember that local politicians are much more beholden to the needs of their constituents than the FCC is[0], so if an entire neighborhood is being technologically blighted, it may make sense for the city council or town to use build-out requirements to ensure that those neighbourhoods don&#x27;t get remain stuck in the 20th century.<p>I think it makes far more sense to let cities and states negotiate these requirements than to disallow them across the board. Over time, it&#x27;ll be clear that cities that don&#x27;t impose all-or-nothing build requirements get much better service in wealthier and denser neighbourhoods (like Google Fiber), and other cities will either follow suit or not.<p>[0] and this is a <i>good</i> thing; they <i>should</i> be attuned to what their constituents need",1425227404

The entire concept of the normally curved scores is that one 50-point difference is just as significant as any other 50-point difference. That&#x27;s why we use standard deviations to compare things. It is true that scores at the very high end are more volatile, since most of the test&#x27;s &quot;space&quot; is devoted to distinguishing between people in the middle of the range, but 1300 does not seem to be at a level where that worry would make sense; the data I have to hand is a score report from 2000 saying &quot;on average, a person with a math score of 710 loses 2 points on a second testing&quot;, which is pretty reliable.

I have thought a great deal about how to maintain content diversity while making use of the collective effort of people to pick content.<p>How (if at all) do you ensure that your platform won&#x27;t become a hostile, self-preserving, lowest common denominator mind/meat ball? (E.g. like HN.)<p>From my experience controversial views require a strong form of protection from the violent inertia of the masses, because otherwise sharing individual ideas becomes numbingly difficult.<p>On the other hand, a single party can not be allowed to force their minority view onto the the common mass. E.g. discourage brute forcing a view.<p>I have witnessed various forms of view-exchange-models:<p>* &quot;mostly unguided&quot;: The 4chan/b model. Pros include shelter from censorship and diverse views, cons are brute forcing views onto the forum is easy.<p>* &quot;strictly moderated&quot;: E.g. wikipedia or stackoverflow. Won&#x27;t talk much about these, in case of wikipedia it makes sense, but generally for a <i>discussion</i> platform this is the worst case as it defeats the whole purpose.<p>* &quot;naive (or incompetent) governing&quot;: E.g. HN, turn view visibility into popularity contest for instance. Many ways of getting it wrong, each with different motivations and results but generally: Turns community against itself, creates a hostile and violent environment, monoculture, perpetual dishonesty. This is another <i>really bad</i> approach. I believe it was popularized because it seems to work as long as only your best friends use the platform. Ergo the &quot;community degraded&quot; excuse.<p>* &quot;sensible governing&quot;: ???. Find good ways to compile a fairly selected subset of a possibly large amount of views to be able to be consumed by a single person.<p>I had one idea that I quite liked: Have a pool of volunteering peers for review. Randomly divide incoming submissions among pool for review. E.g. send a submission to a random subset of reviewers. I think the smaller the subset the better. E.g. if you have 128 peers, send it to three random peers. If any one of those peers &quot;likes&quot; the submission, include it in the &quot;newspaper&quot;. Possibly send it to more people for review to establish prominence in the newspaper.<p>Ideals I wanted to implement: Minority views shouldn&#x27;t have to compete with a horde of people who like cat pictures. It should be difficult to game the system. The process should be transparent, it is good to know that &quot;everybody found X important and somebody found Y important&quot;.<p>One final note:<p>> &quot;Introducing the Internet&#x27;s missing newsroom&quot;<p>This discourages me a ton. Please don&#x27;t over impose yourself a <i>the missing link</i> or <i>your only savior</i>. The most you can hope for is to be a viable addition to my sources.

Although all this happened a decade ago, the challenges these days seem mostly the same, if not trite, in the sense that Asians seem to typically over-value institutionalized education and focus on a narrow set of activities for whatever cultural reason ... leading to racial bias from colleges and conventional life choices from Asians.<p>For me though, I just enjoyed trying a bunch of different stuff out and was fortunate enough to excel at a variety of things that I guess these colleges weren&#x27;t expecting from an Asian. These interests include(d) linguistics, journalism, public speaking, student government, graphics + layouts + grids, game design, acrobatics, and somehow even ended up as an Eagle Scout (shrug) ... on top of hyper-accelerated math, science and tech stuff expected I guess of Asian students. Didn&#x27;t sleep much though.<p>Also, after attending one day of Harvard&#x27;s Campus Preview Weekend, my gut said &quot;uh ... no,&quot; and went to MIT instead. Very happy about that choice in hindsight, purely based on the people I met and the meritocracy instilled in the students; I doubt I use even 25% of course material in the stuff I work on these days. The most important lesson that I did learn at the end of the day is that general society is led to believe that people should/can master only one or two tasks, a possible relic from industrialism. Instead, people should aim to become polymathic, which becomes exponentially easier by learning across diverse interests and realizing that there are many common threads across seemingly different fields -- a personal and particular implementation of &quot;learning how to learn.&quot;<p>* As a side note, San Gabriel Valley?

We&#x27;re Nilas (pronounced ny-las) and our team is building the next generation email platform, starting with beautiful APIs.<p>Developers depend on our APIs, so we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. That means big technical challenges to solve as we scale our fledgling distributed backend. We&#x27;ve also been working on a new email client, and we&#x27;re looking for product designers and front-end engineer. We&#x27;re using React, Flux, and a fork of Atom Shell. More here: <a href=""http://www.nilas.com/blog/splitting-the-atom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nilas.com/blog/splitting-the-atom</a><p>== More about us ==<p>• Backend: Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, and Debian.<p>• Frontend: Coffeescript, React, (Re)Flux, WebSQL, Atom Shell (NodeJS + Chromium)<p>• Like open source? Us too-- check it out: <a href=""https://github.com/inboxapp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/inboxapp</a><p>• We&#x27;re 40% women on our team of 13 (12 engineers), including 1 of 2 cofounders. We want to make that number 50%.<p>• Our sunny Mission office is more lived-in than tidy. Think art studio, not corporate. Our team is more likely to end up in Yosemite or on a bike ride together than drinking at the latest startup event.<p>• We have a flexible vacation policy and value personal responsibility and ownership. Benefits include full health, dental, vision, commuter, and lunch at the office every day. Some remote work / work-from-home is OK too.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://www.nilas.com/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nilas.com/jobs</a> and mention HN.

We aren&#x27;t just about payroll.<p>We are a PEO, which means we coemploy our customers employees (similar to Trinet/Ambrose or ADP Total Source, if you&#x27;ve ever heard of those). Because of that we&#x27;re able to do a lot of really cool things including offer health insurance at a massive discount, as well as bring many other benefits traditionally reserved for large companies to startups and SMBs. We&#x27;re growing very quickly (35-40% month over month) and just raised a $6mm series A from Thrive, Index, a few others[1]. Our founders are former Amazon, Etsy and Groupon executives who have had successful startups in the past.
We handle payments and lots of very sensitive information (bank numbers, social security numbers etc.) so we need people who are comfortable working in that environment. Basically we&#x27;re looking for senior level engineers to help build the foundation for a really awesome engineering org.

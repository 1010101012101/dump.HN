Ansible can both code up and execute those kinds of workflows very quickly.  A major core other aspect is not requiring any agents on the remote nodes, not even having a server, and not needing an additional PKI.  Because it's using SSH, it's using your OS credentials, so if your boxes are, for example, using Kerberized SSH, that just works out of the box.<p>The resource model is still very puppet-like (state=absent/present, idempotence, etc), in that we have states and convergence, but I have tried in many places to not make this a programming language, and keep the amount of syntax down.

Take a drug that's about to go off-patent, make a trivial change to their process, get a fast-track approval from FDA (because it's essentially the same), and a new patent (because it's new and improved!). Competitors play this game too, making copycat drugs which are very similar enough for marketing, but just different enough to deserve their own patent. I'm having a hard time sympathizing with any pharmaceutical company. Disclaimer, I'm almost done reading Goldacre's new book.",1361026094
5231610,comment,5231325,5231558,17,0,Udo,,,"Because the browser is an open stack. There are many layers interacting from the network protocols up to the rendering and scripting engines, and they are <i>all</i> open. The implementations are generally open, but more importantly it's possible to look into the data itself. You can see why this is a problem for DRM. To ""properly"" lock it down, you'd have to close the entire stack, and then you'd have to outlaw open source implementations. The whole thing is just not designed to disobey the user. Keep in mind that this would have to cover the <i>entire chain</i>, from the network connection all the way up to the screen you are allowed to play the content on.<p>For that kind of DRM to work, your browser would have to be turned into a black box that is difficult to inspect, designed to be controlled entirely from remote, and illegal to alter.<p>If this series of events were to unfold, closing the browser would <i>not</i> be done to benefit the content industry directly. They don't need that to deliver content, because they can always just put out an app and pump out their stuff that way. They can also just make a plugin if they want to deliver video content through the browser - which would possible with current technology today. That's not why they are proposing this. Instead this move would serve solely to restrict user freedom to use anything but approved apps for approved content.<p>So to make it clear why this outrage exists: there is absolutely no technical need to include this natively in HTML5. The proposal does not aim to give something to the content industry, it is instead designed to take something away from everybody else. That's not a subtle difference. But, as I said earlier, it's doubtful it will/could play out this way. The only way to achieve this ""dream"" is by making the web as it exists today illegal to use, and then enforce that ban through extensive ISP surveillance. In which case a DRM solution for HTML5 wouldn't matter anyway.",1361026091

5231597,comment,5231064,5231552,1,0,gph,,,">We should be paranoid. Media companies do not have our interests or the interests of an open web at heart. Give an inch and they'll take a mile. Why shouldn't they? The fact is that DRM benefits media companies almost exclusively while seriously harming user freedom. That's not vague paranoia, and imagining it evolving into something worse isn't an unfounded fear either.<p>It is vague paranoia. You're still just throwing out rhetoric without any concrete reasons. It doesn't harm user freedom, I don't know how to express this any clearer: ""THEY'RE ALREADY DISTRIBUTING THROUGH DRM-ENABLED PLUGINS"". All this would do is standardize it and allow users to access DRM content from website like hulu/netflix without needing two different private closed-source plugins.<p>>Do you mean logging in to Gmail? That has nothing to do with HTTPS. HTTPS ensures that two parties can communicate in any way they wish without being eavesdropped on. (And it also suggests trust, but that's a different issue and the spec allows the same eavesdropping protection using self-signed certificates.)<p>>In fact in most any client/server HTTPS connection one party is going to have what amounts to ""total control"". I don't understand how DRM within HTML is fundamentally changing that situation. It's just giving the server copy protection over the media it allows the client to access. It eliminates the need for plugins such as silverlight/flash/etc. that are already being used. It's not like these content companies hand out their media unprotected as it stands.<p>You're still ignoring the meat of my argument. Lets just drop the whole HTTPS analogy/credentials analogy. The rest of what I said is still valid.",1361025793

It can cost over 100 million dollars to produce one season of a quality show. You can only release it on a medium that allows it to be continuously and freely distributed. How do you make money?<p>Ads and Product placement is about it. You really think you'll make that 100 million back?? Especially considering that people could just edit out the ads and redistribute your work, it's really only product placement that could make money.<p>Operating at a loss is not adapting. There's a reason that all of the content currently on netflix/hulu/etc. is already using DRM-enabled plugins. Because you're a f*ing lunatic if you think you can make money through any other method.

Paraphrasing Buffet here:<p><i>""The biggest tragedy of our time is that so many brilliant minds go work in the finance field""</i><p>and also, still Buffet: <i>""Finance is the crumbs of capitalism""</i>.<p>Now I'd say that the reality is quite complicated: nearly <i>anything</i> that helps grow the GDP has a positive effect on technological progress.<p>Even finance, by providing liquidity, plays an important role.  Now when a country like the UK has 8% of its GDP coming out of the city obviously there's something inherently rotten: you can't just have an economy made of nothing.  8% of finance is way, way, way too much and it doesn't take a genius to see were we're heading: major crisis after major crisis.  These ""brilliant minds"" in finance managed to create crazy derived products totally unrelated to the fundamentals of the economy and it cannot possibly be good.<p>So it's all about finding a % that works, just as with everything.  Let's take the ""geniuses"" that go into politics and raise public spending in a good Keynesian fashion to 67% of the GDP like Sweden in 1993 (recent The Economist article)...  Government deficit running out of control, public debt accumulating fast and, eventually, lowering the % of public spending to saner level (49% in 2012) and reducing the public debt.<p>There's a place for ads.  There's a place for a disrupting company like Google who brought us so many things (including a free OS for smartphones, cutting the grass under would be monopolist' feets like Apple or Microsoft).  There's a place for finance.  There's a place for reasonable public spendings (what there probably should be no place for are crazy socialists who are going to use intellectual terrorism to get elected and then constantly raise the power of the state and raise public spendings, constantly strangling the public sectors and destroying the entrepreneur mindset and, inevitably, leading to state default and authoritarian states).<p>The question is: <i>""Which % of the economy should it represent so that we work efficiently?""</i>.<p>Just as with nearly everything: <i>""Which % of the GDP should public spendings represent before there are diminishing returns?""</i> (hint: it's way lower than what socialists think it should be but I'm still a statist: I'm not an anarchist and I do believe there should be a reasonable state).<p>Mostly, I'm siding with Buffet and with GP here: there are two many great minds working on too many bullshits.",1361025227

They are mostly the same crew, having worked on technologies such as SDMI, OMA-DRM, MPEG-DRM, DVB-CPT frameworks and others - technologies that never saw the light of day over the course of 15 years. I always saw it as a travelling circus - people moving from city to city and continent to continent. They work in a symbiosis with technology people from the entertainment industries, who are also part of the circus.\nWhat's important to note is that these people have big named companies on their business cards, but mostly have little involvement into day-to-day business and any products.

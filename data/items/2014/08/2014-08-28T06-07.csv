This would be for obvious reasons - everyone wants to be incubated, but few individuals have the resources to incubate.<p>So what the hell are the rest of us supposed to do?<p>I&#x27;ll tell you what I think the rest of us might do.<p>Instead of hoping for some established individual to come along and provide a sanctuary for our game development dream, let&#x27;s see if we can pool our resources and make our own incubator. It can&#x27;t be impossible, can it?<p>For example, me, personally, I don&#x27;t have much in the way of money, but I have a house in my family that is available for use as an incubation facility. So that covers rent for everyone once everyone busses in there to live. Maybe someone else out there has a bit of savings that could cover our food. And maybe someone else out there has a car we can do collective transportation with.<p>You see where I&#x27;m going? Maybe this is less of an incubator than a commune, but I mean shit, if we don&#x27;t do this ourselves, who&#x27;s going to do it?<p>I know the idea sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s so incredibly frustrating to me that game development requires so few resources (a place to crash and some food) that there&#x27;s gotta be a solution when we pool our resources.<p>Am I crazy? Or is this something that should be tried? Otherwise, I don&#x27;t see how we won&#x27;t all eventually get sucked back into a 9-5, our dreams out of our reach.",1409209055

Not only is that conniving, backstabbing behavior reprehensible and the epitome of &quot;being evil&quot; in a modern civilized society, they managed to come off looking like weak, bumbling cowards in the process. And if their attempts to suppress explicit evidence clearly detailing their feudalistic aspirations wasn&#x27;t proof enough, they come back with a blatantly laughable settlement offer to make it official. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the propaganda - actions always speak louder than words and Google has made clear where they stand.<p>I&#x27;ve been working in investment banking technology for top tier firms for nearly a decade and can&#x27;t recall any cases where trends of thousands of current and past employees laid a billion dollar class action lawsuit on their employers.

Texas, the heart of the mainstream right, is where much of the sprawl is. In the greatest irony, the strongly-left economist Paul Krugman is saying Texas has economically positive liberal housing laws.[1]<p>Does the liberalization of housing law lead to sprawl? How could a place with top down bureaucracy like China produce the same outcome as right Texas with left-approved policy?<p>It&#x27;s all a big mess. Nobody has figured out modern living in an efficient way, I think. I don&#x27;t think Paul Krugman, Rick Perry, San Francisco housing reform activists, San Francisco status-quo activists, AirBnb, etc. have the answers.<p>The natural experiment in China shows radically different laws and market practices still lead to problems.

The Chinese and American culture on road use is completely different: (power/gas) scooters and (regular) bikes are extremely popular in Beijing, and Chinese drivers are generally much more aggressive. Because of this, most road users, including bikers, are capable of driving defensively against other road users. Most bikers/scooter-ers are already comfortable with weaving between cars on their commute. Would a segregated lane make commuting on smaller vehicles safer? Undoubtedly. Would it be necessary to incentivize biking over driving larger vehicles? Probably not.<p>This, along with other problems, like an exponentially expanding middle class population that can suddenly afford vehicles, is only one of the many different challenges most western governments have not experienced, which China currently faces. It may be unfair to quickly jump to conclusions and simply say the Chinese have not learned from the history of urban planning by western countries, when there are very few references from which the Chinese government can draw on, for the unique problems that they are facing.<p>TL;DR: Chinese urban centers have problems that cities in Western countries have not faced.",1409208856

So, almost every part of the process is designed to scale as the company grows. While there are companies which have a take-home problem, most will require you to write code on a whiteboarding discussion in a face-to-face round later anyway.<p>My suggestion here will be to take a few interviews without much expectations and to use them as opportunities to get better at this.

However, currently the WoT is so sparse that you cannot do this.<p>My idea was to use the existing web TLS platform to bootstrap the WoT to a sufficiently large level. I run my email on my own domain. Why can&#x27;t I tell the WoT (and have it trust that it is true) that my public key is XYZ by putting it at <a href=""https://igorpartola.com/pub.pem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://igorpartola.com/pub.pem</a>? GMail could do something similar and at least to start, we could get enough emails validated to start having the WoT spread on its own.

You may have heard of different Chinese &#x27;dialects&#x27; such as Mandarin and Cantonese.  The same characters are pronounced differently in different dialects, and it&#x27;s more than just an accent: someone who speaks only Mandarin may follow something like 20% (ish) of an overheard conversation in Cantonese, if they concentrate hard.<p>- Even in a single dialect, many words sound exactly the same, but mean different things.  Using a phonetic system would harm comprehension.

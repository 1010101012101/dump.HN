I know: I have written a couple. Anyway. Moot, since this isn&#x27;t about WebSocket.<p>WebSocket only provides you with a bidirectional message channel. It&#x27;s low-level, and does not provide application messaging.<p>WAMP can run _over_ WebSocket, but also other message channels. E.g. you can have WAMP running over a shared-memory message queue.",1443347956

But things weren&#x27;t quite so bad after he left the scene.

Looking at the email addresses he used, I think he started working on the network stack on his spare time, while employed at SFR, a French telco.  He implemented an in-kernel JIT for BPF (<a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/437981/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lwn.net/Articles/437981/</a>), speeding up packet filtering; now that BPF is fast it is also used for performance profiling (filtering and aggregating in kernel) and syscall filtering.<p>There are of course others working in these areas, but I think Google has been going after them: Van Jacobson is a high-profile example.

It seemed to work fine for them, especially since most reporting can be done using MS Office, which everyone is familiar with. Maybe it&#x27;s getting expensive to support, given how many licenses they need?<p>Yeah, the technology is insane. I&#x27;ll give you an example of what I mean by that.<p>Think of this situation: all of the parts of the drill string that contain the sensors that provide real-time environment conditions AND control the direction of drilling are, say, 3 km underground. How the hell do you send movement commands or receive sensor data? It&#x27;s not practical to extend a wire for that distance. Wireless communication is unreliable at best underground. More importantly, how do you provide power to these tools?<p>Luckily for them, mud is continually pumped through the drill string for many reasons, including cooling the drill bit and breaking down the formation. So they used that mud to communicate and transfer power.<p>The general idea is to vary the flow rate on the surface to transmit binary information. To send data upwards, the mud flow is blocked and unblocked, and the pressure change is detected on the surface. It&#x27;s pretty fascinating stuff!",1443344889

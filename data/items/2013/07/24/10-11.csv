Rather, they are increasing the speed in which censure, control, and surveillance are added.<p>We can&#x27;t even claim that this is the initial battle. That fight has already been fought. We had the discussion around common carrier principles when peoples talked about net neutrality. We had the discussion when people discussed piracy. We had them also when wikileaks and SOPA was in the news. Even some of our allies has turned.

Even if an outright ban does not exist in blanket legislation, there <i>are</i> restrictions, codes of practice, industry bodies, laws applying narrowly to certain media channels or something like that.<p>Basically, porn gets regulated/restricted/banned always by whatever authority has the means to do so. Always. And some authority always has jurisdiction in some way over every mainstream media source. The difference on the internet is that no one <i>could</i> regulate it. There was no authority or industry body. No power that could be appealed to. Now the internet can be regulated, seemingly.<p>That is the story here. Not &quot;Cameron is a prude&quot; or &quot;Cameron is pro-censorship.&quot;<p>The internet is regulatable now. <i>That&#x27;s</i> the story.

6095383,comment,6094946,6095360,2,0,grey-area,,,"Typography is about more than just the choice of font, and in some ways the choice of fonts is less important than how you employ the fonts you do choose, how you combine them and which weights you choose to use where. I think reading books like this one would be a great first step. Some of the advice is a little opinionated, but most of it is sound, it reminds me of Strunk & White in that way.<p>An example of misuse of typography; he advises you not to use various forms of emphasis at the same time (bold, italic and underline all at once), and to use a regular and limited progression of headings to indicate importance and hierarchy. I have seen clients attempting to design making all these mistakes without considering the result of those choices and ending up with an unsatisfactory result which fails in difficult to quantify ways. They sense it isn&#x27;t quite right, but don&#x27;t pin the blame in the right place (on the lack of coherence).<p>The good news is you can learn by trying, none of this is particularly hard, it&#x27;s like learning to write well - it comes with practice, really looking at what others do, and listening to criticism when it appears justified. Some of this is subjective of course, and dependent on the culture and sensibilities of the reader, so it&#x27;s something you&#x27;re going to acquire by osmosis rather than by reading a brief guide I&#x27;m afraid.

6095270,comment,6094946,6094946,0,0,jvzr,,,"The one thing that bothers me is the whole first chapter. The point of the book is to give advice on typography. And the point of the first chapter is to tell the reader that the writer has to get to the point or else it&#x27;s a waste of the reader&#x27;s time:<p>> Writing as if you have unlimited reader attention is also dangerous, because running out of reader attention is fatal to your writing. The goal of most professional writing is persuasion, and attention is a prerequisite for persuasion. Once the readers attention expires, you have no chance to persuade. Youre just giving a monologue in an empty theater.<p>Well, then... Don&#x27;t write that chapter and let&#x27;s get down to business! I guess I&#x27;ll skip that chapter.<p>Edit: Oh boy. I hadn&#x27;t read about Violet&#x27;s and Trixie&#x27;s resums. I like typography and give it a great deal of thought in every digital undertaking; but I will surely not hire Trixie because she used a better template: she gives less information and the whole resum feels like it has as much negative space as content. When, and if, I hire someone, I want information, not thin air.<p>Edit 2: Another thing, regarding the 1.25 to 1.45 line-height he recommends. I feel like it&#x27;s a lawyer&#x27;s thing. Anything smaller than 1.5 looks very clamped, and most times people use 1.5 to 1.75. Kudo for the font size though. My poor eyes are grateful.",1374660568

This could be as disruptive and problematic as the widening gap between the wealthy and the poor.<p>Porn filters will be of no concern whatsoever to anyone under 40 with the most rudimentary technical chops (and appetite for porn). What else will be banned? It is getting to the point where fearmongering and shameless populism and shilling for votes by politicians result in useless laws being enacted only to incriminate anyone at all, when the opportunity presents itself to make an example of somebody.<p>I suspect this technological gap is going to get much worse before it gets better, if it does get better at all. The types of people who participate in the game of politics have very little in common with the types of people who have an understanding of the technical world. But can that last forever? Kids now live online with few exceptions, and a technical understanding of the world will hopefully become second nature to most people, eventually.",1374660498

Send some resources to the planet, automated mechanisms to build out some basic infrastructure (cabins, greenhouses, barricades, etc). Then once things are in place, and a self-sustaining environment can be built find some people willing to spend the rest of their lives there, perhaps older people but families wouldn&#x27;t be impossible. Think of a pioneer spirit, there would be no end of people willing to put their name down for a one way trip!<p>The main reason I say one way? Given it is an 21 month minimum round trip or even five years, the health (mostly bone density) issues are astounding. So, let the people decide to be the first Martian colonists and let it be a one way trip. If the preparation package was sufficient I know I would like to put my name down but I suspect that my wife wouldn&#x27;t, so that vetoes me, but I know I am not alone.<p>Perhaps it is the idea of people dying in space and the publicity from that that worries those in charge. But lets remember that these trips aren&#x27;t without risk, so lets say that the risk is better managed if they just stay on Mars.",1374660242

The only issue with the keybindings is that they are different from other software. This should not be an issue! After all, an editor is probably going to be your most-used piece of software; spending a good amount of time up front to get even a small benefit over the long run will definitely pay off.<p>After a week or two of using Emacs, you will get used to all of the keybindings and stop thinking about them. They&#x27;ll become entirely natural and instinctive. Sure, Emacs takes more effort to learn, but you should view this as a good thing: more powerful tools are always like that. An F1 car is also difficult, but nothing will get you around the track faster.<p>The problems you&#x27;re talking about will go away after a bit of effort. Is it really worth throwing out all the additional power and configurability--advantages that will last for <i>years</i>--just to save yourself a couple of weeks of minor frustration?",1374660010

It is easier to buy, since all you are doing is mixing 2 parts oxygenated water with 1 part muriatic acid/HCl (@33%), which can be obtained at any hardware store. It shares the same problem with Ferric Cloride: after etching, the resulting solution is hazardous and should be disposed accordingly (€€/$$).<p>I've done this at home just like the original article but with this other solution and after 3-4 tries got pretty good results. Good enough for some basic SMD circuits.",1238402664

If you are bored on the five minute drive to and from school, read a book.<p>(I don't have kids, but this is probably what I'd say.)<p>Anyway, I remember that when I was a kid, I wanted all those gadgets.  The objective reality was that I didn't need them for anything.  I was never far from a real computer, and I didn't have so much stuff to do that I had trouble keeping track.  If I did, I would have used the standard-issue ""assignment notebook"".  (Which I never used, much to the dismay of school administrators.  ""How will you remember that you have to do problems 1-5 on page 42 tomorrow!!?"")<p>But I digress.",1238402384

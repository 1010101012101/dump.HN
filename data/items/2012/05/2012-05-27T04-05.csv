I was at UCB in the early 80'S and a friend of mine borrowed his father's Apple II and we had a lot of fun learning how to program it and play games, etc.  My friend found a fun article in a hobby mag on building a heat (infrared) detecting device for the computer that could track and display objects in the room based on their temperature.  We bought the parts (at significant expense for a couple of college students) and proceeded to follow the instructions in the article.  As a Mechanical Engineering student I did not understand a lot of steps but my Electrical Engineering friend felt he could build this device.  One of the steps involved opening the computer and tapping into a power or data bus or something (I have no idea why it had to be done hot, or maybe we missed a step). Anyway, my friend slipped and shorted out some pins on one of the ICs on the motherboard and the computer crashed. After that the computer was DOA and would not boot. My friend was distraught as he promised his father that he would take extra good care of the Apple computer (I think he was already in the doghouse for wrecking the family car).<p>Luckily, I remembered that Woz was in town to get his Master's degree so I called 411 and got a phone number for Steve Wozniak in Berkeley, CA.  I call and a man answers and I ask ""Is this Steve Wozniak that designed the Apple computer"" and he said ""Yes"" and I said ""Hold on, my friend has a question for you"" and quickly hand the phone to my friend... saying ""Its Steve Wozniak, tell him what you did and then ask him how to fix it"".  My friend was very skeptical but plays along and tells the guy on the phone he's toasted his dad's Apple II and it won't boot.  Woz asks him a few yes or no questions and then my friend says something like ""I shorted pin abc of IC def to line ghi on the motherboard"". Woz thinks it over for a few minutes and then says, well, you probably fried chip jkl on the main board or chip mno on keyboard, so replace those chips and see if it will boot"".

He is devastated, and later on he says that the ""loss could not be measured,"" but Charles Dana of the New York Sun had this to say on the topic:<p>* ""The destruction of Nikola Tesla's workshop, with its wonderful contents, is something more than a private calamity. It is a misfortune to the whole world. It is not in any degree an exaggeration to say that the men living at this time who are more important to the human race than this young gentleman can be counted on the fingers of one hand; perhaps on the thumb of one hand."" *<p>That's insane. Can you imagine working on the kind of things that put you at the pinnacle of people ""more important to the human race""! That is absolutely insane. I look at the kind of stuff posted here and on TC/Endgadget and those kind of sites, and most of the stuff we read about doesn't even come close to the kinds of things Tesla was working on. In today's world, what are the things that are ""most important to the human race""? How do you even judge that?<p>The other tremendous quote was by Tesla himself. A reporter was interviewing him when he dropped this gem:<p><i>""I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to successSuch emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.""

The German panzers, with their short 50mm and 75mm guns, could only penetrate the thick armor of the T-34 from point-blank range of 100m or less, but the T-34 could destroy the poorly armored Pz III and Pz IV from up to 1,000m.

Furthermore, the use of sloped armor on the T-34 and KV-1 tanks indicated that German tank design had fallen woefully behind.</i><p>Guderian came away from the battles of 1941 believing that Germany should just drop its own tank designs and straight-up copy the T-34.

4258578,comment,4257311,4257640,1,0,jasonbarone,,,"That's interesting, how so? I found the complete opposite to be true when using both Wordpress and Squarespace for small business sites like local businesses, entrepreneurs, blogs, portfolios, etc.<p>Designing for Squarespace is by far the simplest process I've used. It's way ahead of even Shopify, which has been touted as being incredibly easy to design for. I can take 90-95% of a completed PSD design to Squarespace in under an hour. If the design is already chopped up in HTML, even faster. It cut my site development time in half, and my clients prefer the user interface versus Wordpress.<p>The ""Selective Display"" section are comparable to Drupal, yet they are much easier to work with.<p>My frustration with Squarespace's previous version (Version 5) was that it was getting a bit dated and it was a bit closed off, meaning some designs and project were just not possible. Squarespace 6 is solving a lot of this.<p>Regardless of whether or not it's a threat to WP or Weebly, it's an awesome platform to work with and has many features that are simply amazing.",1342569583

4258575,comment,4255638,4258300,1,0,mistercow,,,"I kind of wonder about that reasoning, though. I mean, no it's not trivial if you imagine having to foot the bill for it yourself, but proportional to the kind of money Twitter is dealing with, it's, well, still just 1% of a JS file.<p>But I don't think we need to think of it in terms of Twitter's scale at all. The point is that saving 1% for basically free, is saving 1% for basically free, and that's worthwhile no matter how big you are. On its own, it's a drop in the bucket, but the cumulative effect of many small low-opportunity-cost savings is a significant low-opportunity-cost saving.",1342569522

At the last tech event I was at I was one of three women; one was the girlfriend of the organizer, one was a non technical person looking for technical help for a start-up, and the other was me. I felt awkward and stood out like a sore thumb. There's nothing that a bunch of women trying to raise money to encourage women to be in tech could do to make me feel MORE awkward at events where it's obvious I stand out.<p>Look, I think the project itself is kind of silly. But it could bring more women into tech. And more women in tech won't make me stand out more; it will make me stand out LESS. That's the only way it's going to shake out.",1342569479

Normally, the cops would just let you off with a warning, but the security patrolling this area wanted everybody taken in. It was a very annoying experience and really was a waste of tax-payer money. But once we were released ~7 hours later, we didn't really think much of the arrest (rightfully so, the judge laughed at the case when we went to court).<p>Now, the worst part of the whole experience was when we found our mugshots plastered all over search results for our names. The results rank pretty high in some cases too, higher than some social media sites. The problem with this whole situation lies in two places in my opinion, one being the fact that your mugshot is posted online right when you get arrested, whether or not you are convicted. And two, that there aren't any restrictions put in place by the government sites that release these pictures. I am all for net neutrality, but this is most definitely an invasion of privacy.<p>And there are so many of these mugshot sites that you will never be able to completely remove your face from every single one of them.

So what?""<p>Many proofs depend on the unique factorization of primes, many directly and many many more indirectly. It is a trivial mechanical modification to them to deal with the non-uniqueness of a prime factorization if you admit 1 as a prime number by explicitly taking that case and saying it doesn't affect this case. So in that sense, no, it's not important.<p>Except... you've now taken numerous proofs and made them longer... and for what? There's no didactic advantage. There's no proof that is made easier by letting 1 be prime. What's the advantage of adding all these special cases? None.<p>And that's the real reason. In the end, ""by definition"" is the <i>only</i> justification, and the reason we choose the definition is that it works the best. Unlike 0 to the power of 0 where there's at least a bit of argument to be had (though the overwhelming preponderance is for it to be 1), there's no reason to put 1 in the set of prime numbers.

There is no library function for this, because the response is asynchronous.<p>> There is always a function for that in a high-level languages like Ruby (index), JavaScript (indexOf) or Python (index).<p>These functions don't do what your interviewers asked. Python's index won't give you duplicates, and it's at least equally non-trivial to use JavaScript's indexOf with two arguments in a loop as it is to use a hash, and the algorithmic complexity of the former is much worse, so why would you do it?<p>> Another sad thing, which I gladly didnt see that much (but there still were a few interviewers) in the Bay Area compared to the East Coast, is asking terms, function names, definitions, slang, etc. Expecting people to remember functions syntax is a sin in itself!<p>On this point, I agree.",1342566451

293609,comment,293544,293602,0,0,justinsb,,,"Agreed - and I'd be interested to see what happens if you replace the sprintf interpreter with a function like itoa.<p>While I'm not surprised that V8 beats existing Ruby implementations, that's more a demonstration that those implementations aren't very fast.  When your benchmark tells you you're beating C, it's probably a good idea to check that your C code isn't stupid, before posting results on your blog...",1220424489

293606,comment,292648,293562,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>U.S. Court Affirms Employer's Right to Read Employees' Email</i><p>Fraser v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company is entirely irrelevant here: That case dealt with whether a company has the right to access emails stored <i>on the company's server</i>.  There's a question of privacy there, but not one of computer crime -- Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company did not access computer systems without the owner's permission.  This is manifestly different from the situation as I read it to be here, where it was being alleged that the article's author's VPN was being accessed without his permission.<p>The Structured Settlements case is more relevant, but it fails on two counts: First, the legal theory being put forward by Structured Settlements involves them merely observing what Mr. Palma had done on one of their computers -- their claim is that they didn't access his Yahoo account, but merely saw him accessing his Yahoo account -- and second, the Structured Settlements case has yet to be tested in a courtroom.<p>Yes, the US has very weak <i>privacy</i> laws, but that doesn't extend to its <i>computer crime</i> laws -- and accessing a computer system without authorization is a computer crime, not just a privacy violation.<p>And of course, IANAL, the above is not legal advice, etc.",1220424128

293602,comment,293544,293544,0,0,dzorz,,,"The benchmark is really crappy. If the language uses O(n+m) concatenation for strings of length n and m, then the total runtime would be O(n^2). That would happen if strings are immutable and no ""stringbuilder"" is being used. If that special case was optimized or if the strings are mutable, total runtime is O(n).<p>Here is the corrected C version:<p><pre><code>    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n    #include <stdlib.h>\n    int main (int argc, char const *argv[])\n    {\n      char *str = malloc(sizeof(char) * 238890);\n      char buf[5];\n      int i, n = 0, len;\n\n      for (i = 0; i < 50000; ++i) {\n        len = sprintf(buf, ""%d"", i);\n        strcat(str + n, buf);\n        n += len;\n      }\n      return 0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt runs 100 times faster than the original program.<p>Edit: If you think I ""cheated"" by doing some calculations that I shouldn't do, here is a C++ version that runs just as fast as the improved C version:<p><pre><code>    #include <string>\n    #include <cstdio>\n\n    int main()\n    {\n        std::string str;\n        char buf[6];\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < 50000; ++i)\n        {\n            sprintf(buf, ""%d"", i);\n            str += buf;\n        }\n    }</code></pre>",1220423416

293600,comment,292351,292780,0,0,axod,,,"I agree... For quite a lot of people email <i>IS</i> too hard for them. Sometimes takes them quite a while to understand how it works.

293594,comment,293391,293565,0,0,trezor,,,"I happen to disagree. It gives the iluusion of being faster because it <i>scrolls faster</i> than other browsers. This is because it scrolls <i>more</i>. More than other browsers. More than other applications or what is considered the platform default.<p>This is particularly annoying when you want to scroll with any kind of precision. Including other scrolling glitches, this becomes annoying pretty fast and I would In fact say its scrolling is by definition broken.<p>As for speed. Tried zooming on any particular with a reasonable amount of content? The entire browser freezes and is on hiatus for several seconds.<p>The speed is way overrated.",1220421719

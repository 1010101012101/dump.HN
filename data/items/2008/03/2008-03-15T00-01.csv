137291,comment,136926,137017,0,0,binglo,,,"That's quite nice. Still not sure how I feel about wiki-style plain text markup formats though. I like them for simple and short docs, emails, and README's because it looks good in the editor, but it seems like the more you ask from that sort of format, the weirder things begin to look as you add features to support writing larger docs (and you end up with more syntax to memorize as well).<p>Thanks for the heads-up.",1205542418

137288,comment,137080,137080,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"If I were a betting man, SnapTalent would be the first I'd put coin on.  I didn't actually think much of it (and, in fact, I think when I first talked to them early in Winter08 they didn't even have any useful code written yet...but maybe I'm misremembering), until they'd actually launched.  It really looks great, though--a perfect way to handle the tech jobs market, which is a HUGE industry in and of itself.  Monster and Dice have been fighting it out for years, and spending millions just marketing themselves.  SnapTalent allows the world of bloggers and tech sites to market for them.  Recipe for win if ever I saw one.",1205542267
137287,comment,137226,137226,0,0,dkasper,,,"One thing people don't want to do is have to memorize a syntax just to use a search engine.  A lot of people have trouble with Google as it is.  I realize that the idea is to augment traditional search engines' capabilities (so that people will have <i>less</i> trouble), but it's going to have to be easy for non-hackers to catch on to it.  The learning curve has to be shallow or the average user is going to give up on it.  That being said I really like the way it tells you what it thinks you mean as you type though, and definitely think there is potential for this type of thing.",1205542215

137279,comment,136759,136811,0,0,Electro,,,"Agreed. I have no problem with government subsidising businesses to help get them off the ground, because a lot of the time it helps them grow to the level of competing quite quickly; except French farming.<p>However, no corporate group can ever perform well. One company running in a form of dictatorship over their product, like Jobs, can react quickly and, even for a large company, remain competative. However, if every decision has to go through multiple screening processes, tests, etc. you end up with a production cycle equivalent of Microsoft.<p>The Quaero project is doomed to failure. Not only is it going to have corporate bickering, but it's going to be in multiple languages. You can bet a large number of coders will enter from the UK, Netherlands and many other countries.<p>This means you're going to need translators to get the documents to read correctly in each individual language, or there's going to be many screw ups. Not only that, but you'll be faced with several days delay between project heads to get to a meeting. Bascially for a weekly status update, it would take probably 3 days to get everything translated and checked. So it's a weekly-3 status update, and what you did today is never going to be on the agenda, it's going to be the 3rd day on the next agenda, by which time something important is gone from your focus.<p>I belive the best words to describe this are, eww, and, no!",1205541284

137276,comment,136926,137203,0,0,binglo,,,"Yes. Thank you. I like POD for man-page -style docs, but for longer multi-section docs I'm not sure it buys you much more than plain text (except that you can easily convert to other formats). Also, it's harder to read than plain text -- though maybe easier than docbook xml.<p>The POD docs I see as html are just single long html pages. I realize this is just an implementation issue though.",1205540825

137273,comment,137080,137241,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>My favorite is TipJoy</i><p>I like the basic principle of aggregating micropayments, but I think TipJoy going to be very limited until people can actually get money out (which of course means that TipJoy has to deal with the regulatory issues).  So far they've accumulated $1531.54 in tips (assuming their website is up to date), which means that their 3% cut adds up to a grand total of $45.95... which isn't going to make anyone rich in a hurry.",1205540600

137268,comment,136364,136622,0,0,pg,,,"It would depend on how much you used them.  In News.YC I try to avoid using even closures as much as I can.  In the earliest versions I made practically every link on every page be a closure.  The source is so simple that way.  But keeping that many closures around (in case the user hits the back button a couple times then makes another choice) soon became unwieldy.  You rapidly find you have a couple hundred thousand closures in memory. So now whenever I can conveniently get all the state I need into the arguments of a url, I do that.<p>You can see which links need to be closures by mousing over them.   If the link looks like r?fnid=hashkey, it's a reference to a closure on the server.  Usually it means there is something that has to be done after whatever the link does.<p>Though Arc has continuations, I haven't needed to use them anywhere in News yet (except for catch and throw, which is a degenerate case).  Nothing has state that complicated.",1205540303

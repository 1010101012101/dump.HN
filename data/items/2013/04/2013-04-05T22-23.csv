5501547,comment,5493280,5500060,1,0,danbruc,,,"It is common to store per user salts together with the hashes, often even as a single string formed by concatenating the salt and the hash. Therefore getting hold of the hashes usually means getting hold of the slats, too.<p>But the other case I mentioned - using the same salt buried deep in your code for all users (what is called a pepper as I learned recently) - will do what you describe until the attacker is able to figure out the pepper used by either stealing the code or brute forcing it.<p>Finally note that just using a pepper is no good idea and even when combined with a salt needs some careful thoughts. Just using a pepper will yield equal hashes for equal passwords while using a unique per user salt will avoided this. The other problem is that with a pepper you are reusing the same secret for each user. Therefore an attacker has thousands or even millions of samples and may be able to extract information if the scheme is not designed carefully. Combining password, salt and pepper must essentially avoid the same pitfalls as keyed hash functions when combining the key and the message.

And you've got to admire that.<p>LucasArts's adventure games in particular were brilliant examples, and I think their defining characteristic is that they never took themselves too seriously.

Aaron had access to JSTOR from his own Harvard campus account, so Aaron's own actions (going so far out of his way to do so from MIT's net) indicate he thought he was doing something at least a little bit wrong.<p>I don't think that evading network bans by itself is necessarily a horrible offense, but I certainly don't think it's completely OK and as far as I know the law doesn't either. In fact the CFAA could apply based merely on the cost of the MIT techs' time it took to track him down, even if he never intended to copy documents.<p>Where intent <i>did</i> play a role is that it made the existing charges he could have received <i>just for his actions</i> more severe. But he could have wanted to donate to charity and his acts alone would have been illegal.<p>And, I also think they would have been morally wrong, just as I wouldn't trespass on someone's property if they asked me to leave, no matter how innocuous my purposes are otherwise.<p>Don't just take my word for it, even Dr. Lessig agreed with that much (that Aaron's actions could be construed as wrong): ""...if what the government alleged was true  and I say if because I am not revealing what Aaron said to me then  then what he did was wrong.

We produce so much consumable garbage even the non-homeless go dumpster diving (freegans.) Cities such as Detroit are bulldozing thousands of homes that fell apart because they were simply abandoned. In this sense, the US has excess capacity.<p>The second issue becomes one of autonomy. Do we force the homeless out of public parks? As pointed out above a lot of homeless people have mental illness issues (arguably all long term homeless do.) Deinstitutionalization means we just don't lock people away in insane asylums anymore.<p>One thing I've learned from running a business is that its ok for things to be broken some of the time.

We recognize and expect this in technology. Indeed, that is the very basis of our growth. On the contrary, pretty much the entirety of government policies globally the past 50 years has been optimized solely around growth in annual GDP records.<p>These policies can create big problems as wealth from the working class is re-allocated to the business class through lower interest rates, property forfeiture for development, low bank lending standards, and outright subsidies.

It is a non-trivial, NP hard problem.  The problem is similar to the 2d bin packing problem, but we are trying to optimize the size of the bins.  Small rectangular shapes must be packed into larger rectangles in an optimal way.  There are nesting algorithms to do this optimization where the large rectangle dimensions are inputs.  However, we want to optimize the dimensions of the large rectangles.<p>The inputs are:<p>-A list of unique small rectangles.  The list includes the dimensions of the small rectangles, a number that represents the rectangles frequency of usage relative to the other small rectangles, and the orientation (whether or not it can be rotated 90 degrees)<p>-The maximum number of large rectangle dimensions. And the minimum and maximum dimensions of the large rectangles.<p>The output is an optimized list of large rectangle dimensions.<p>One way to prove the validity of the result is by creating a nest of the small rectangles within the large rectangles.  Here is a paper and an open source project that provides a solution to the 2d bin packing problem that we are currently using to nest.  We are using the Maximal Rectangle algorithm and we vary the heuristics (typically bottom left or contact point heuristics).<p>http://clb.demon.fi/files/RectangleBinPack.pdf<p>https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack<p>How do I solve this problem?",1365200065

The moment someone (apple) designed an app-centric fullscreen OS, the stage was set for the generation of UIs that can become as immersive as good adventure games.<p>Mailbox is the example that sticks out in my mind currently. Can't really get much more boring than e-mail, but they figured out how to gamify it in a way that mimics the internal consistency of a cult classic title. The 'tutorial' mode of this and other apps gives me a phantom pavlovian feeling of opening the shrink-wrap on old cereal-box-sized CD-ROM packaging.<p>I think the if we look to video games for inspiration we can produce even more engaging environments in applications designed for productive use.

But build order, at start of each game, there's a series of steps you need to do like the optimum workers to build, to mine Vespene gas; at which time to send workers to build expansion base, build marines/zerg's etc. And adjusting your strategy depending on map, other races on map and opponent style.<p>Translated roughly to non-player's words, playing Starcraft is not about winning but about optimizing your action and reaction to the quickest and most efficient. I don't wake up everyday thinking that the project is going to give me a hard time, I already have a builder order to efficiently tackle the problem, e.g., lower expectations for stakeholders early on, debugging the code step-by-step to get a handle, browse reddit for diversions etc.<p>I will not get frustrated if I can't win against CPU or debug the code, because winning is outside of my control depending on the skill of my opponents, allies and luck etc; I will only evaluate myself on how much I optimized on my build order. And if my build order sucks, I watch my replays and search online for a better one.<p>It's only I have my build-order deeply ingraned in my mind, that I work on my APM; so I can act/react faster and it comes second nature like driving but doing it faster. The same thing IMO applies to poker, trading and sports. You can't focus on binary outcome of winning or losing because so much variables are outside of your control; it's about focusing on your build order.

Similarly with the bottom bits, I run the project in debug mode, it pops over with the process's output and disappears when there isn't anything I need to see.

The only difference is incremental compilation during development which many people setup using a 'watch' plugin or the asset pipeline in rails anyway.<p>> And then there's also the fact that I can't stand having IDEs underline everything in red when I'm in the middle of typing a line.<p>Changing the linting timeout is very simple.",1365199399

10766814,comment,10766432,10766432,0,0,icebraining,,,"I think the problems identified with the architecture are being wrongly imputed on REST.<p>REST is synchronous in terms of request/reply, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that higher-level actions must (or even should) be restricted to that cycle, so subprocesses like the notification should never have to block the stock update. Even if the requester needs to be informed about that, the stock updating mechanism should instead create a new Resource that tracks the notifications, and send the link to it so that the client can see how it&#x27;s going.<p>But this wouldn&#x27;t be necessary, because I agree that the stock updating shouldn&#x27;t have to known about the notifications - but again, REST does not require it to!<p>The way to architect this using REST would be for the Notification Service to track how the stock of each product is currently. Since polling each product is inefficient, the stock manager could offer a feed that lists the latest stock updates, just like blogs do with posts.<p>This doesn&#x27;t require a SPOF like a messaging bus, it doesn&#x27;t suffer from the &quot;service going pop&quot; problem (since we&#x27;ve eliminated the dependency the inventory service had on the email system) and it&#x27;s proven to work at a huge scale - the web.",1450612531

10766792,comment,10765539,10765539,0,0,GameTheory8,,,"From my consumer perspective (mostly Amazon Prime packages):<p>I&#x27;ve probably had 1 or 2 random lost/stolen packages over the last 6-7 years, from a handful of locations. There&#x27;s more that randomly go missing for a day or so but those are usually carrier issues, and not lost, but delayed.<p>From my business perspective:<p>We&#x27;re a semi-large FBA seller on Amazon and have had 100,000ish orders over the last 2 years. I&#x27;ve received many messages before where customers claim to have packages go missing, but a quick reply notifying the customer that we&#x27;ll get x carrier to investigate usually gets a quick reply that they found the package.<p>To us, this is more of a numbers game where we allocate 0.x% of revenue to lost/stolen/damaged packages and then just try to minimize the losses on a case by case basis. Our main goal is to have happy customers that receive what they ordered, so if there&#x27;s any delivery hiccups, we always take the liability and quickly replace or refund.<p>Bonus Amazon tip:<p>Delivery confirmation w/tracking information isn&#x27;t proof of delivery for packages, and they&#x27;ll refund/replace orders even if the tracking details say &quot;Delivered&quot;. This makes sense when a package gets delivered and someone steals it before the customer takes possession of it.<p>As a seller on Amazon, in the event of a problem/claim, Amazon requires signature confirmation to guarantee that the package was actually received. Signature confirmation is expensive so it then only makes sense for packages valued at $300+. (Products in Electronics might be different w/higher loss rates)<p>IMO, damaged packages are a bigger issue, but then that becomes mostly a packaging, then carrier issue.<p>What&#x27;s the solution? No clue, but adding friction points such as giving a package to a neighbor, or having to go somewhere else to retrieve your package just slowly adds to a negative customer experience over time and should be avoided whenever possible.",1450611909

So I&#x27;ll take back my idea on the disgruntled employee.  I originally posted when I saw very few comments.<p>That being said, I&#x27;d like to clarify thoughts on Occam&#x27;s Razor.  It&#x27;s a bit off-topic, but I think it would be an enlightening discussion and don&#x27;t expect it to go on long.  The rest of the discussion here about OP is far more interesting.  I just appreciate it if someone points out when my logic is flawed, so I hope you take it the same way.<p><i>It is used as &quot;a heuristic technique&quot; and &quot;is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result.&quot; Occam&#x27;s Razor says nothing about what the actual truth is - it&#x27;s just a tool use when choosing hypotheses to pursue.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think you and I disagree with anything here.  I am surprised and curious as to why you might think I thought otherwise.  Using your words instead of mine, I was curious why the investigation was so quickly pursuing the hypothesis of foreign governments hacking Juniper&#x27;s engineering team to plant code.  My question has now been answered as the thread evolved.<p>I think that you understand Occam&#x27;s Razor&#x27;s letter and how it is used in academic circles, but you do not understand how its spirit still applies in non-academic circles.<p>Occam&#x27;s Razor simply states (quoting from the Wikipedia article):  &quot;Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.&quot;  Hypotheses are theories on how the world works.  Detectives also have their hypotheses in their investigations on what happened in a crime.  Infosec professionals also have their hypotheses on what makes a newfound piece of malware tick.<p>Kepler, the FBI agent that chases serial killers, and the Symantec guys who discovered Stuxnet all share in common the dogged determination to figure out the truth by chasing facts.  If you want to be a stickler on semantics and say that Occam’s Razor is referring to scientifically testable hypotheses, it seems a bit too dogmatic to say that we can’t scientifically test with experiments whether someone is the person that stuck the knife in another person, so Occam’s Razor should never be discussed.  Good (I emphasize good) police work doesn’t make it necessary to design an experiment for that.<p>Focusing on simpler ideas that fit the facts is more profitable than focusing on grandiose ideas, even if grandiose ideas also fit the facts, if both ideas explain the subject equally (equal quality of explanation being a key point of consideration, as discussed in the Wikipedia article).  Those grandiose ideas aren&#x27;t discarded because Occam&#x27;s Razor is indeed <i>only &quot;a heuristic technique&quot; and &quot;is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result.&quot;</i>  If more facts arise that cause the simpler explanations to lose weight, the investigator changes course.<p>I fear you are projecting too many assumptions onto people who cite Occam’s Razor, thinking that they’re taking Occam’s Razor to mean license to conclude an argument as finished when most people likely are not doing so.  Certainly, I wasn’t.  :)",1450611499

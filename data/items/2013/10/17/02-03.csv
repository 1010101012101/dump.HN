6563428,comment,6559404,6562772,3,0,elohesra,,,"I suppose the answer can only be supplied if we know more about you as a developer, and as a person. If you&#x27;re a perfectionist, then it could well be that your previous projects are perceived by others to be of better quality than you yourself perceive them. A perfectionist could well consider a project &#x27;unfinished&#x27; if it doesn&#x27;t cover improbable edge cases, for example.<p>However, assuming that you&#x27;re accurate in your statement that your projects were unfinished, then it would appear that you need to question why that&#x27;s the case, as we cannot infer that the traits you&#x27;ve ascribed to yourself are the cause of project failures without knowing more about the other variables in the equation. For instance, the projects may well all have been failures for no fault of your own: scope creep, management interference, poor teamwork (or poor team members), or any number of other variables could be responsible. But since this is not something we can address at this point, let&#x27;s assume that your project failures are indeed a result of your perfectionism.<p>The easiest way (in my experience) to &#x27;cure&#x27; perfectionism in software is to follow the YAGNI (&quot;You Ain&#x27;t Gonna Need It&quot;) mantra, coupled with approaching a project from a divide and conquer perspective (yeah, pg would pretty much hate this). First break the project into its key deliverables and its &#x27;nice to haves&#x27;. Once all the key deliverables are complete, then the project is complete; &#x27;nice to haves&#x27; aren&#x27;t factored into the completeness equation for the project. Once you know what your key deliverables are, then order them in terms of dependency: if deliverable A requires that deliverable B be completed before deliverable A can be completed, then focus on deliverable B first. Now that you know what you&#x27;re supposed to be working on, you can get started on the deliverable at the root of your dependency tree, but whilst working on it ensure that you&#x27;re <i>only</i> adding the functionality necessary to complete the current deliverable. As you work your way through your deliverables, refactor the previous deliverables as necessary to make your current deliverable work. For instance, if your root deliverable wasn&#x27;t required to be thread-safe when you first wrote it, but your new deliverable requires it to be thread-safe, then work your way back through your deliverables refactoring as necessary in order to meet the requirements for your current deliverable.<p>By sorting your deliverables into dependency tree, you can ensure that you can properly apply YAGNI. It&#x27;s very tempting for a perfectionist to turn into an architecture astronaut, and spend weeks or months mapping out the entire solution and all its edge cases before they&#x27;ve even started to work on a single deliverable; by keeping your deliverables in a dependency tree and working from the least to the most dependent, you force yourself out of this mindset. By applying this method, you also force yourself away from analysis paralysis, because you&#x27;re not permitting yourself to consider patterns or architecture until the project&#x27;s current deliverable necessitates it.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that this method won&#x27;t work for all projects, as it requires a good understanding of what the deliverables for the project actually are before you can apply it. It also may not work for you at all, since it&#x27;s all down to personal experience, but I&#x27;ve personally found that forcing yourself to focus only on the concrete deliverables ensures that you don&#x27;t end up stalling yourself in analysis, and gives you lots of little pep boosts in the form of finished deliverables and refactorings.<p>Nonetheless, good luck finding a cure that works for you.",1381978446

6563409,comment,6562561,6562798,9,0,_frog,,,"I&#x27;m going to say Bulbasaur has the edge here. Pikachu has a pretty decent speed stat, but it doesn&#x27;t have access to many worthwhile moves. Let&#x27;s talk about the build you&#x27;d use to pretty decisively beat a Pikachu.<p>Pikachu&#x27;s common passive ability &#x27;Static&#x27; means that it can potentially inflict paralysis when hit with physical moves. On top of that, Bulbasaur has a fairly high Special Attack stat, so it&#x27;d be a good idea for it to use Special moves rather than Physical. On top of that Pokmon get a Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) for using moves that match their type, so we want a non-physical Grass type move. &#x27;Leaf Storm&#x27; is probably the best move we could use in this case. To get a Bulbasaur with that move, you have to do some breeding, but it&#x27;s totally possible.<p>Now we&#x27;d also want to take advantage of Bulbasaur&#x27;s own common ability, &#x27;Overgrow&#x27;, which boosts Grass type moves&#x27; effectiveness by 50% when it goes below 1/3 of its HP which, combined with our STAB means Grass type moves are now 200% as effective. Of course once we get our HP that low we&#x27;re going to want to avoid taking much more damage. Using Bulbasaur&#x27;s &#x27;Sleep Powder&#x27; move at this point will cause Pikachu to fall asleep, preventing any further attacks.<p>So we&#x27;ve got our basic strategy, get down to 1/3 of our HP, put Pikachu to sleep and then wail on it with Leaf Storm. While we&#x27;re letting our HP drop we could use something like &#x27;Swords Dance&#x27; to boost our attack stat as well.",1381978143

You can look us up - check out what we have done with freephoneline.ca - There was a post on RedFlagDeals for 5000 beta accounts in 2007, and thats how we launched.<p>Freephoneline.ca sold/sells $50 one time phone lines, started in 2007 and still offering the same great service. \n(profitably) Actually some of Freephoneline&#x27;s work has got us where we are today.<p>One of the philosophies we have is to own and pay for the network, remove any recurring fees by renting other peoples stuff.\nThis leaves little recurring cost - which translates to savings.\nDeliver strong value and savings for Canadian consumers, in doing so - some of them decide to buy other things from us and be life-long customers.<p>How can a server be free? / or of little one time cost, I will share how it is done.<p>First buy 100&#x27;s (or 1000&#x27;s) of physical servers with piles of CPU cores, mountains of ram, for the best deal possible, and pay cash.\nWe owe nothing on the gear, it&#x27;s not leased. They are all on the rack, so if they are sold now - or not sold they cost about the same monthly overhead to us. Specifically we have 40,000 VPS&#x27;s worth of equipment on the rack (so far).<p>Next, build a very efficient, and redundant storage infrastructure, use SSDs to make people happy - do not use expensive name brand storage solutions (or you are dead in the water and out of business.)\nUse something groovy, say one of the network file systems from the OpenStack project.\nSomething that scales endlessly.<p>Then buy or build some of your own data centres, ( www.rackanddata.com + www.data-vault.ca + Fibernetics.ca )\nCost advantage - we don&#x27;t have to pay $600 /$900 / $1200 per rack.\n(actually we don&#x27;t charge ourselves anything for space, we use some of the empty racks - so its $0/mo )<p>Then build 30,000 Sq/Ft of solar on your roof so you can produce 4 x the electricity you use - to sell to the grid (and be green).<p>Then Build a national network with 100&#x27;s of thousands of Canadians who use and rely on it daily (Fibernetics.ca + Worldline.ca) One of Canada&#x27;s largest private CLEC&#x27;s\nThe idea here is the access to bandwidth at this volume, is really quite in-expensive and sort of already paid for.<p>Then, we consider a small % of the people find out who we are and buy internet from us for their homes and office, or maybe even buy an office phone system.\n(actually we sold $200K worth of phone systems this month from people using our cloud.)\n... this good will we built is worth more then just about any regular fee per month.<p>Summary;\n- colocation space, free\n- bandwidth, almost free\n- server hardware, far less then the $35 - maybe even under $10 ;-)\n- power - hedged, \n- profit margin on the servers, we invest it, in infrastructure - usually in things that have a +30% return - so in effect we make our own recurring income on the server - to build a better company, which in turn offers better deals.\n- goodwill to customers - just like master card, Priceless.<p>It&#x27;s so good, we were just going to offer them free... but we knew no one would believe it.<p>Cheers,&quot;",1381977752

I have no idea where they&#x27;re taking their profits if they&#x27;re pushing down on the low-end prices too.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new laptop for over 2 years, and nobody&#x27;s been selling anything worthy of replacing what I&#x27;m already using, which was built in 2010. For a few brief months that year, HP made a wonderful MBP clone (magnesium alloy case, 1600x900 14&quot; screen with edge-to-edge glass, SSD, etc). Soon after, that product line turned into the same plastic 1366x768 crap everyone else was selling, and that&#x27;s been what&#x27;s filled store shelves ever since. Meanwhile, my 2010 laptop is starting to fall apart, with dead pixels, an overheating GPU and lost battery capacity.<p>I am looking forward to buying an ASUS UX301 this November to replace it. That&#x27;s the first and only Ultrabook-class laptop I&#x27;ve seen since 2010 that&#x27;ll actually be an &quot;upgrade&quot; without buying some thick &quot;gaming&quot; monstrosity. It&#x27;ll have a Haswell i7-4558U, which comes with the Intel HD 5100 graphics, the first Intel integrated graphics chip to outmatch the 3-year-old Radeon in my current laptop. Plus 8GB RAM, 512GB of RAID-0 SSD, an all metal and glass case and up to 9 hours of battery life. Assuming this PC in that configuration actually makes it to market.<p>What&#x27;s amazing to me is that this many months after Haswell parts started showing up in stores, that one ASUS laptop is still the only announced product by any name-brand manufacturer with the i7-4558U/HD 5100 parts. Every other new/&quot;refreshed&quot; laptop that&#x27;ll be in stores this holiday season will either have an integrated GPU incapable of playing games well on the higher resolution screens they ship with, or give up its thickness and battery life for a discrete GPU.",1381977740

Not having sales and traction is what decides if you go home after you &quot;go hard&quot;.  Your staff burns out when they realize your reality distortion field was just hallucination and trying to fake it until you make it vooza style.  Realizing startups are more about developing sales and marketing skills to find a channel to a market is the master key.  This has nothing to do with lean imho. If anything, lean makes you look in the mirror and gut check more often if you&#x27;re not hiding behind a keyboard.<p>- No Architecture? Having an architecture discussion starts with &quot;Have you had any relationship with a code base longer than 2-3 years?&quot; The architectural reality is the first version will change, because it&#x27;ll largely be wrong.  How much you plan for this is something you learn when developing any software.  It&#x27;s important to be kind to your future self and using enough tooling and structure that&#x27;s useful, but not enough that it slows you down.I&#x27;ve never skipped architecture with MVPs or lean. I use light frameworks that keep me organized.  Sinatra is one example, every language has one. Most importantly, I don&#x27;t build my perfect empire the first go around, as a burning effigy to my brilliance to distract myself from the fact that I might not be developing as an entrepreneur to learn the sales and marketing skills to find users, or a business model.<p>- Investors: The day you take money, is the day you pretty much guarantee to ultimately sell and have less and less say in your company.   Someone else is telling you when you go home after you go hard if founders can&#x27;t figure out to make a business model out of the startup. This has zero to do with lean, if anything being the master of your own destiny is being profitable so you can have a say on doing things your own way.  Being able to have more of a say in your own destiny, lean, or no lean is more about the founders and the business, sales and marketing skills that may not exist, and whether they&#x27;re doing anything to learn about it.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a software, project and product guy from a background in lean via implementing tech in manufacturing.<p>I got to spend almost 10 years learning from, implementing, and re-implementing lean in a factory perspective (adding software to the process) to really have a tiny glimpse of how lean made companies like Toyota what they are since the 60&#x27;s.  If we look at lean on it&#x27;s own, and drop startup from it for a second, lean works.<p>Translating lean to the startup world will only make startups into more of a science where it&#x27;s an art.  Like science, it should evolve, it&#x27;s not perfect, but less perfect is a lack of process.  I don&#x27;t think the author is advocating for this at all, but in knocking lean, I would have loved to hear the steps and processes he learnt that did work for him in his scenarios.<p>Applying lean to the startup world is special for startups, not for lean.<p>For me, lean is learning to look forward and take fewer wrong steps, and to learn quicker, but to always be learning.  Not using lean is like looking back and saying out of the 100 things I did, I wish I knew to find the five or 10 I needed.  Lean helps narrow it down a great deal to get you on your way, but by no means is it the instant, perfect formula.<p>Lean tells me to shut up.  Every idea, thought, innovation, revolution I have, to shut up, and simply try it and test it to see if it&#x27;s something people want, hopefully enough to pay to keep me on my path of learning.<p>Having a business model, users, customers and making money might not be what everyone&#x27;s out to do, but if it is what you&#x27;re out to do, lean is definitely one way to get there.",1381975460

There&#x27;s no shortage of cynicism to go around, here and everywhere.<p>On the other hand, what does the HN crowd say about technologies they really do find uninteresting and unimportant? Absolutely nothing. They drop right off the bottom of &quot;NEW&quot; without a single comment.<p>Edit: And to be fair, most market-speak is so vapid that we often only get one meaningful line of copy stating the purpose of a thing and a picture showing us its general physical shape to go on. We have to deduce everything else from that. In short, we&#x27;ve gotten used to disappointment.",1381975348

For example, I do not believe that prototyping should be done in kernel mode at all, nor do I believe that using Lua will shield from incorrect operation or crashes.  However, there is already proof that device drivers can be written in Lua (<a href=""https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitch</a>), and it&#x27;s great to see more push in that direction.<p>After all, why use C if you have a working alternative?  We just need real world experiments to see if Lua is a working alternative for the kernel.",1381975324

6563263,comment,6560805,6562593,1,0,Alex3917,,,"> Do you categorize vaccination as modern medicine, or as public health?<p>It depends on what point you&#x27;re trying to make. E.g. if you&#x27;re talking about contribution of pharmaceutical drugs to longevity, then it doesn&#x27;t make sense to include vaccines since they&#x27;re not drugs. If you&#x27;re talking about the contributions of modern medicine as a whole, then it make sense to include all the vaccines developed roughly since Dr. Gold popularized the gold standard clinical trials, so sometime in the mid to late 1950s. Or if you&#x27;re talking about the contributions of the western medical system as a whole since its inception, then it probably makes sense to include all vaccines, etc.",1381975288

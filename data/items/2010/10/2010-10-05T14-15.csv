Ending the extrajudicial punishment of children is not such a big step, because it entails only a small extension of human status (having already incorporated women, slaves, foreigners, etc.)<p>I doubt that judicial punishment of strangers is going to end anytime soon, but note how different that is to punishing a family member.<p>However, now you mention it, there is an interesting similarity. Why does punishment happen? Not for the reasons most people think. For instance, it doesn't (and can't) transmit moral knowledge from the punisher to the punished. Neither does it reliably cause obedience.<p>In reality, society punishes criminals in order to prevent greater suffering in the form of larger scale rioting and madness.<p>Similarly, parents punish children to prevent <i>themselves</i> from going mad. But if knowledge spread of how to be a better and happier parent then this sort of punishment would end.<p>Such knowledge may already exist in basic form:<p><a href=""http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/introductory_articles_about_TCS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/introductory_articles...</a>",1286290755
1759971,comment,1759475,1759706,0,0,yesbabyyes,,,"This is exactly what I think. I often rant about how everybody needs to learn to program, but what I mean is not so much being able to write code in a specific language as the mindset of approaching problems, and having an understanding of how a computer works. Today programmers are in a sense the gatekeepers of information and I don't think that's healthy in the long term.<p>There are several layers to this. In general, I think people older than ~50 approach computers in a totally different way than people younger than ~20, with us in the middle a little spread out. A good friend's father, for instance, used to hit Space in his word processor to center headings. He didn't do this because he didn't find the button for center alignment, he did it because <i>he didn't think to look for it</i>.<p>Another dad recently bought a new Android phone. He was studying the rather thick manual carefully, while his 10 year old daughter grabbed the phone, snapped a picture and just started using it. Startled, her father asked her how she knew all this stuff, to which she replied that she didn't know how to do it beforehand, she just did what seemed reasonable.<p>It might be a stretch, but I think that programming is on the same range of using computers (tools in general? I don't know) in this way. Solving problems is basically trying what seems most reasonable first. A well defined API is usable without even consulting the documentation.<p>I definitely think that teaching basic programming and computer science to everybody would be a huge win to society.<p>Sometimes I think of myself as a literate monk in medieval times. I imagine that lots of people would request their services, friends and family needing help with writing and reading. This is also one of the biggest reasons for my wanting more people to learn how to program: It's purely selfish, I get awfully stressed by having people come to me with ideas they can't implement, trying to make me do it for them.<p>I'm sure a lot of people here have similar experiences.",1286290755
1759970,comment,1759475,1759475,0,0,araneae,,,"This article is attacking a straw man in which programming is equivalent to writing compilers.<p>The reality is that almost all of the sciences (and even some of the social sciences) have come to the point where you need to be able to program.  Any data-driven field will require you to do data analysis.  A decade ago you would need to know math, today you need to know math, and R.  This is not the same as writing a compiler, but it is programming.  And that's the best case scenario.  In many fields, like genomics and ecology, the programming tasks become much more complex.<p>And that's just the sciences.  The business world is also increasingly data-driven, and with increasing amounts of data there's increasing amounts of coding involved.  Sure, not every field requires an understanding of programming, but not every field requires an understanding of history, and it's still taught year after year.",1286290741

That doesn't necessarily mean that it is any easier to get out of bed. It took me a few months to get used to this fact. You have to get a mentality that when the alarm goes off, you get up. For instance, if I went to bed at 1am, I would set the alarm for 7:15. I would set my ""wake window"" for about 1.5 hours beforehand. For the first few months, if my alarm went off at 5:45, I would wake up, feel great, look at my clock and realize that I still had over an hour that I could still sleep.

So I dropped Chargify and redid everything with Braintree's API.<p>Braintree's API is pretty darn good. But it's not up to Charigfy's standards. Chargify has some pretty great features that are really simple to implement (like metered billing, and others of similar complexity). Not going with Chargify has slowed down my iteration speed when it comes to billing changes. It's just not as easy to do certain things when you have to write all the code yourself.<p>That said, you can do a lot with Braintree, and their customer support is fantastic. Their API is continually being improved. I also have a slight sense of relief that I won't be dependent on Chargify. Chargify, as we know, is a startup in search of a long term business model, and there are no guarantees that they'll be able to do what I need 6 months from now. But that security comes at a price - writing my own code.<p>What I would not do is use Chargify with a gateway with a crappy API. If something happens to Chargify, you could be stuck using something horrid.<p>In the end, most of what you get with Chargify is increased development speed if your billing gets complicated. But I wouldn't sweat the decision too much. It would be nice if Chargify supported Braintree V2 - as you'd have the best of both worlds.",1286290019

However, since I already have a full time job that I enjoy and don't plan on leaving any time soon, I figured I would just skip the consulting phase and go straight into developing software products.<p>The idea was to focus on small businesses that may not have the money to hire someone to build a complete software application for them and leverage their business knowledge in a niche market to build the software they want and sell it to them in license format later.<p>On the surface, this seems win-win since the business owner gets software built on the cheap, and my company can sell the software to whoever we want when we're finished since we own everything.<p>However, this hasn't quite gone as planned.  The small business owner I'm working with keeps expecting each iteration of development to be production ready and tries to go out and use the software right away.  He then gets upset when it doesn't do what he expected (which, he's not 100% sure about in the first place).<p>The problem is, I don't have the domain knowledge of what the software needs to do.  And the other guy doesn't really know what software is capable of doing.  This is OK if both parties are willing to work on growing the software iteratively, which is what I thought I made clear we were going to do in the beginning.<p>To make matters worse, I'm 99% sure he's either sold or given a copy of the software to at least one of his friends who owns a similar business.<p>So, at the end of the day.  I get all of the stress of a consultant with none of the payoff.  I've only sold one license to this guy and I doubt he'll buy any more.<p>I'm definitely not going to bail on this project.  I'm proud of the software I'm building and I think it will grow into something worthwhile.  I just think I went about this the wrong way.<p>Is this a dumb idea?  It hasn't worked out well for me so far, but I don't know if this is the norm.<p>Have any of you tried something like this before?  If so, how did it go?<p>Thanks for the advice.",1286288761

For real access control using this I think you'd need something like a permission to replicate distinct from permission to read and a permission to replicate only through a specified filter.

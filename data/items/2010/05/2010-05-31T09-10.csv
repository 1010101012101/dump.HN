Although it is a little surprising you haven't heard of these guys - or at least the product - it's been in the press a fair bit. Hopefully the lack of marker research / market awareness is not indicative of any other issues :)<p>Generally speaking, there's always room for more than one vendor, for any product or service. Even in the giant-dominated worlds of search and social networking there are plenty of smaller players who do well. If there is a market for something, there'll be room for several suppliers - perhaps many.<p>So, I wouldn't get disheartened. As others have said it's free market validation for you (assuming they have customers). So look at their customers - who they are, what's the use case for them, what value do they derive from it? How much do they pay? Answers to these and other questions will help you market your version more effectively.<p>The only issue is: can you deliver? Do you have the technical know-now to build this product (e.g what about the card-reader? security, customer data protection etc etc?). And do you have the resources / sales route to take it to market and get customers?<p>If you think you can build this and get it market, then great. Go for it.

Thankfully, some truly meddlesome mod took all meaning from the title and instead used the hackneyed print headline that was no doubt written to fill a certain space in a broadsheet.<p>I don't know about the rest of HN, but I had no clue what a Portolan Chart was until I read this article. My re-titling was intentional and I would imagine helped get the article to the front page.<p>Stop meddling or I am going to stop contributing. I understand there are times when a title is misleading or goes against guidelines, but this change is just a mod on a power trip.",1275296627

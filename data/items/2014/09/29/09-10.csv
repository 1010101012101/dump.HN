I&#x27;m presenting it more like a solution for small/medium needs for search without the needs to add extra dependencies in your architecture.<p>In my opinion this can help younger project/startup to raise their project from the ground by minimizing the complexity of their system (less maintenance)<p>But it&#x27;s not a solution viable on the long run until the Postgres address loads of the problem on the search. I&#x27;m hoping that now that we have JSONB coming 9.4 that the search get some serious attention so PG can become a serious candidate as document store.",1411984790

Pre-2.8 it was a language for experimental, actively evolving codebases only, and it would absolutely have been unsuitable for &quot;a 2MLOC software that your organization is going to depend on for the next decade&quot;. 2.8 to 2.9 had closer source compatibility, 2.10 introduced binary compatibility guarantees and standardized deprecation cycles. 2.10 -> 2.11 was completely painless. If you look at e.g. the way scala-actors deprecation was handled, or the testing and infrastructure (e.g. mima) around 2.10-2.11, it&#x27;s clear that typesafe is taking compatibility very seriously and it is now a language suitable for that &quot;2MLOC software that your organization is going to depend on for the next decade&quot; (not that the system&#x27;s going to be 2MLOC when you write it in a much more expressive language).",1411984713

8382213,comment,8379862,8379862,1,0,craig0990,,,"I remember feeling the same thing - I could just &quot;build a website&quot; but I wanted to prove that I had actually learned something over the last three years.<p>So what did I do? I re-implemented Git in PHP (read-only). It was, to put it mildly, difficult, and stressful, but I actually managed to pull it off (mostly).<p>I didn&#x27;t just choose at random, obviously. I wanted to add file version support to an open-source project, and after some basic research, settled on Git. The catch was that the open-source project ran in a pure-PHP environment (no modules beyond those commonly found on shared hosting). So I had to find a way of reading Git repositories in PHP without resorting to exec() etc. Hence, read-only Git in pure PHP. Throw in WebDAV or SSH and you can actually push / pull to those repositories with front-end clients like SparkleShare, which was a good candidate for future work.<p>I nearly went crazy, of course. I had little-to-no understanding of DVCS concepts, graphs, and so on (big O analysis is still difficult to be honest). However, by writing the project, I got much more direct experience of graph theory than I ever would studying a text book. This has turned out to be incredibly useful in my day-job as a developer.<p>The take-away I&#x27;m trying to get to is: pick something completely (or slightly) unrelated to computer science concepts like big data, AI, etc. and find something you&#x27;re interested in. Then ask the question &quot;How do I apply X to this?&quot;.<p>(These examples are purely off the top of my head, and may actually be ridiculous in practice. YMMV)<p>&quot;How can I use big data techniques to analyse my web server&#x27;s access logs?&quot;\n&quot;How can I use AI/Machine Learning to detect shellshock attacks on my server?&quot;\n&quot;How can I use computer vision techniques to render a map of the local area using drones?&quot;\n&quot;How can I use big data, AI, machine learning, and computer vision techniques to analyse the proportion of cat pictures and videos posted to social media?&quot;<p>What I want to re-iterate though is that I started with &quot;I want to add file versioning support to this software&quot; and ended up discussing graph theory, diffs, patches, open-source etiquette posts by ESR, big-endian and little-endian integers (Git uses both in it&#x27;s file formats), binary fanout tables, the SHA-1 algorithm, content-addressable filesystems, and all sorts of other crazy stuff I hadn&#x27;t even anticipated when I started.<p>My supervisor liked it - I wanted to sleep for a month straight.",1411984605

8382191,comment,8381810,8381810,10,0,dosh,,,"There&#x27;s a biological phenomenon called &quot;apoptosis,&quot; which may give us hints into the cause and behavior of suicides.<p>Apoptosis, simply put, is a cell-level suicide (or programmed cell death), which happens from multiple causes, but generally for the beneficial effects to the entire body, which happens to be a tragic outcome for the cell itself. This helps to increase the overall efficiency of the body or to prevent any possible damages.<p>But, as you can presume, this &#x27;suicide&#x27; sometimes happens to a perfectly healthy, normal cell -- when it&#x27;s isolated, lacking interactions with other cells. Of course, as with most living things, this is not a binary state, where a cell immediately performs the suicide on a trigger, but more of a gradual, transient process, which when pushed beyond a threshold or when the cell-death process wasn&#x27;t halted for some reasons, may conclude in the death itself.<p>This brings important insight into the behavior of human suicide as well. What role does interactions play part in making a healthy (or a depressed) human being to commit suicide, and what process can we learn from cells to prevent this from happening? Life forms, no matter how complicated they seem, in general are fractal in nature with some degree of complexity layered by emergent behaviors, so there, we can learn something from our roots, or cells in this case.<p>Even more disturbing thought might be: Are suicides sometimes beneficial to the society? I&#x27;d hate to ponder on this idea, but if we can assume a perspective of an alien scientist observing human colonies from far far away, this might an interesting area to explore.",1411983745

Eugenics was merely a psuedu-scientific argument for sentiments that already existed. If I had continued yo elaborate on the topic, quotes by Margaret Sanger (founder of Planned Parenthood) on &quot;Blacks and Jews&quot; among others would follow. It might be noted that 16 million Black offspring have been aborted since Roe Vs Wade and that abortion is the 2nd leading cause of death in the Black community - more than cancer and heart disease combined. But that would deviate from the topic of distrust surrounding Ebola.<p>To Darwin&#x27;s defense, he goes into depth about problems with his theory within the final chapters of the text and I have considered his wording and the quote I gave in context of his experience traveling with a slaver as well as the social-economic-political environment he was beholden to, and take it as a warning of what was to come.",1411982135

If you compile with debugging information included (with or without optimization), GCC will give you tons and tons of template name stuff in your compiled binary.  I have one program that is over 100 MB and well over half of it seems to be template-related debugging stuff.  It&#x27;s unlikely that you could generate so many and such long symbols by hand if you weren&#x27;t using templates.  If you build without debugging symbols, or strip them, or separate them out, you may have different results, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the most common scenario for C++ users.<p>You can also wind up with actual instruction bloat too: a seemingly &quot;high performance&quot; function written with recursive templates may wind up with dozens of kilobytes of machine code thrashing your i-cache while a perfectly good &quot;old style&quot; function would do the same job with a hundred bytes.

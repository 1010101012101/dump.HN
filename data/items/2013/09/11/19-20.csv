6369608,comment,6369114,6369254,26,0,fintler,,,"We commonly reboot entire clusters at once (around 10,000 servers in larger clusters -- each running a full Linux OS) over PXE without a problem. We have a configuration management machine that creates an image, then we push that down to a small cluster of TFTP servers that serve it out. The strain on NFS (we keep parts of the OS in RAM, and load other parts on demand over NFS) after we kexec from the PXE kernel into the production kernel causes more problems than the initial TFTP traffic (but it usually works fine as well). Btw, after booting, we use PanFS (DirectFlow) or Lustre for computing stuff, not NFS.<p>Although it&#x27;s not what we use, here&#x27;s a program that does a similar type of management: <a href=""http://warewulf.lbl.gov/trac"" rel=""nofollow"">http://warewulf.lbl.gov/trac</a> If you take the time to combine Warewulf with something like Puppet or Chef, you&#x27;ll have a nice system for managing 100s of thousands of machines (I could easily see this scaling to over a million servers if you have the cash to build something like that).<p>If you&#x27;re wondering about dynamic libraries in an environment like this, take a look at <a href=""https://github.com/hpc/Spindle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hpc/Spindle</a><p>And yes, I still get giddy when I type one command to reboot 10,000 servers.",1378929547

Sciences, and scientific theories, can be easily identified by the property of falsifiability. If a theory makes coherent, testable predictions, and if the predictions can be tested empirically, then there&#x27;s a basis for falsification. Economics doesn&#x27;t have this property. Many natural sciences do. For example, anything having to do with evolution -- very specific, very testable, and excellent at resisting falsification. Not that surviving falsification is required to call something science -- failed theories and fields are scientific in a sense, certainly more so than those fields that never test their theories.<p>> ... whilst medics - like economists - are left with statistical tests, ad hoc explanations of confounding factors and a raft of exceptions that arguably falsify claims as uncontroversial as &quot;drinking in excess is bad for your health&quot;.<p>Yes, but those aren&#x27;t really falsifiable, are they? One can argue that a failed test like that is equivocal, not a basis for casting out the underlying theory. In a formal sense, that prevents their being called sciences.<p>I have to say about modern medicine that it&#x27;s rapidly moving toward being evidence-based. Many clinical practices from years past have failed more rigorous efficacy trials and have been cast out as a result. So I would call it science on the basis that its theories and practices are open to falsification.",1378928747

That said, there&#x27;s a very real sense in which the parts of your program that ARE pure are much safer and easier to reason about.<p>The best way to visualize this is that you can theoretically turn an impure function into a pure one, watch:<p><pre><code>   void printAGreeting(string greeting)\n   {\n       IO.printLn(greeting);\n   }\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s impure.  The string goes into a black hole and does nothing from the program&#x27;s perspective, but changes the state of the world from everyone else&#x27;s perspective (it probably makes pixels change on a display somewhere).<p>So how do you make that function pure?  Like this:<p><pre><code>    TheEntireUniverse printGreeting(string greeting, TheEntireUniverse u)\n    {\n        return u.makeSomeAtomsMoveAroundBobsConsole(greeting);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis function takes not only the string greeting, but <i>everything else in the universe</i>.  You, me, everyone who&#x27;s ever lived, bob&#x27;s console, everything.  It performs the same function by returning a new universe with everything the same except for the atoms moved to caused the greeting to appear on Bob&#x27;s console.<p>Obviously we can&#x27;t do this, but (in Haskell, say) the IO monad is a context in which we understand that anything done inside of it has the affect of changing the &quot;real world&quot;.<p>If you pretend that you really had to do the whole &quot;universe dragging&quot; thing around for anything in the universe that WASN&#x27;T part of your program (we&#x27;re assuming it itself is in some black hole somewhere to avoid paradoxes and such), then you would darn well make sure you kept this pain-in-the-ass operation as &quot;thin&quot; as possible.  Why?  Well, you&#x27;re lazy!<p>When you look at things that way, there&#x27;s an analogy to writing stuff on bare metal hardware.  You know you&#x27;re going to have to write some assembly language (or maybe even direct machine code if you don&#x27;t have an assembler).  What you want is to get to the nice cozy world of C as soon as possible, so what you&#x27;re going to do is use assembly to code only the smallest surface area you need so that writing in C makes sense, and everything else that doesn&#x27;t need to be in assembly for performance sake you do in C.<p>So it is in a purely functional language.  The idea is to &quot;get out of IO land&quot; as fast as possible.  To use a DB as an example, you&#x27;d like to live in a world where your little view of the DB could be expressed in purely functional terms (writing functions that result in a modified version of that view) and only at the VERY LAST MINUTE would you send that DB view to an IO function that actually sent the view down the wire to the DB.<p>The same goes for files, sockets, gamepad IO, you name it.<p>And you&#x27;d be surprised how little you need to actually interact with the world between getting your data and pushing out state changes.  A game, for example, can do a WHOLE LOT OF STUFF between reading the input state and writing graphics commands.",1378927822

So, in the presence of a grandmaster, they might make fools of themselves while the merely accomplished take the opportunity to learn something. However, in discussions with an accomplished person, a novice will more easily see their inadequacies. Thus the ability to teach is the ability to communicate expertise further down the ladder than others, and the ability to rapidly learn is the ability to reach further up the ladder and so waste less time on the intermediate steps. People are usually better at learning from certain mediums and types of people as well.<p>Along these lines, one goal of an expert teaching a novice is to turn a novice into an effective autodidact. An effective autodidact a) knows they are ignorant, b) knows that the ladder of expertise exists, c) knows how to climb the ladder. It is possible to communicate to a novice signposts that will help them understand their progression despite their not having experienced it yet. Again, these extend further depending on the ability of the novice and the expert, but for anyone they will extend further than the knowledge the novice can actually identify as not being known yet. Even very dull people can grasp something as simple as &quot;Bob really understands this job. Follow his advice, even if it doesn&#x27;t make sense to you yet. It&#x27;ll be hard at first but stick with it and you&#x27;ll know twice as much in a month.&quot;<p>Again, I&#x27;m not aware of any studies so am happy for you to directly disagree, but I hope this reminds you of interactions you&#x27;ve observed as I do believe these behaviors are common.",1378927736

Misunderstanding of concepts like equality under the law ARE conservative stereotypes (conservatives often think liberals think everyone should be perfectly equal).

They often misunderstand what &quot;racial equality&quot; means and turn it into &quot;colorblindness&quot; instead, thinking all we need to do is to <i>see</i> everyone as exactly the same. Colbert parodies this because in his monologues and interviews he specifically refers to the Wikipedia definition: he points out that he can&#x27;t tell <i>skin</i> color, not social-economic status. The viewer quickly sees the absurdity of the false political correctness because it&#x27;s obvious his subject has a different skin color.<p>So I think you need to re-evaluate Colbert&#x27;s parodies because you grossly misunderstand them, and apparently what &quot;colorblindness&quot; means.

6369228,comment,6368468,6368468,15,0,unoti,,,"Emotional control can, most certainly, be taught.  But it rarely is in our society.<p>When I was a kid, I learned from observing my father that being a &quot;real man&quot; means shaping the world according to your view of how it should be-- taking control, avenging wrongs, showing strength.  In my 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been totally reshaping my ideal of what a real man does, and it involves the opposite in many ways: making people feel safe, having excellent self control, and outstanding control of my emotions and attitude.  The shocking thing to me is how often the behaviors I know as right according to my new ideals make me behave in ways that my father would see as pathetic and weak.<p>But it&#x27;s completely possible to re-train one&#x27;s own emotional composition and approach to life.  That&#x27;s what Stoicism is all about.  I wish someone had taught me about this when I was young.  A few things I wish I&#x27;d known about when I was a kid:<p>1. The No Complaining bracelet challenge[1]. This was life changing to me, because through this exercise I learned that &quot;letting it all out&quot; doesn&#x27;t really help much, and what really helps is reshaping your own mind.  I&#x27;m still doing this challenge today, as a life habit, even after several years.<p>2. Stop worrying and stop living[2].  You can boil this book down to a few pages, with a lot of stories that help you understand why and how.  I did this book on audio during a long car trip.  Also life changing for me.<p>3. Stoicism.  Reading Letters from a Stoic[3] taught me that there was an entirely different way to look at friendship that I&#x27;d never considered.  And it taught me that there are people who constantly practice controlling their emotions in a positive way, the way a martial artist constantly practices how to move his body.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.acomplaintfreeworld.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acomplaintfreeworld.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Stop-Worrying-Start-Living/dp/0671733354"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/How-Stop-Worrying-Start-Living/dp/0671...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Letters-Penguin-Classics-Lucius-Annaeus/dp/0140442103/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Letters-Penguin-Classics-Lucius-Annaeu...</a>",1378926330

In these sorts of discussions, people always bring up, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerburg, etc. I don&#x27;t know the details about most of them, but I do remember reading that Bill Gates&#x27; parents&#x27; money and position allowed him to spend a tremendous amount of time programming computers in an era when this was incredibly rare and expensive.<p>Perhaps college was pointless for him, but that&#x27;s in large part because of his drive and access to resources that few people have.

You get to do a lot of hands-on stuff, participate in projects, do exersizes and labs etc. All those have a much wider scope and breadth that what you&#x27;d learn from a hands-on approach just on a specific problem on some startup.<p>2) It&#x27;s also not true that all fields are about &quot;trying it out&quot;. You won&#x27;t learn calculus, linear algebra, OS internals or complexity just because you chanced upon a small real-life problem working as an intern and you googled your way out or came up with your own hacky solution. Some stuff you need to actually study, that is go through the bibliography, read past and present ideas and notions, etc. In college you get to do that without obstractions like &quot;we need to ship next week&quot;, for numerous study subjects, and with guidance offered to boot.",1378926185

They clearly <i>knew</i> they were going to be on camera, and they had to have known that that footage would be reviewed in the future.  Since they <i>knew</i> they were going to be on camera but did it anyway, it pretty clearly was a risk they calculated and decided was an acceptable payoff.  Currently it looks like nearly <i>30</i> people were directly involved, and authorities have nothing to show for it but the arrest of an accomplice or two, and month old rumors of another single arrest.  They might have pictures of the people involved, but it hasn't helped them actually do anything about it.<p>As for political fallout... what political fallout?  They got some bad press on the evening news but do you think they actually give a damn about that?  Other countries sent a political message scolded them for using fake passports, and they sent a pretty clear political message: that they are willing to kill anyone they don't like, and no amount of cameras will stop them.<p>I really have a hard time seeing the people who planned this doing anything other than patting themselves on the back for a job well done.",1294253857

2071983,comment,2070025,2070871,0,0,jokermatt999,,,"RF:G only has destructible buildings/objects, however. The level geometry is still static.<p>The original Red Faction had largely destructible level geometry as well. However, that was just based on explosions deforming the terrain, rather than a physics simulation of destruction like RF:G. Polygons would fall if they were attached to nothing. The multiplayer level set in the natural canyon/bridge area is a good example of this: the large bridge in the second level (3 paths) is able to be taken out with some rockets and persistence to actually fall into the pit in the center. However, there was a limit to how much the level geometry could be deformed, and after a certain amount, explosions would stop removing sections from the terrain. It takes a good amount of time to get to this point, but it is possible. Also, the developers did a great job of hiding some interesting secrets in the deformable terrain. The multiplayer level with the two buildings on opposite sides and multiple levels with the desert in between has a hidden fusion rocket launcher (BFG, essentially) on the roof that's only accessible by destroying the terrain to get up there if my memory serves correctly. Also, the lobby level has four sections hidden behind walls, and a hidden roof area. Clearly, they put some work into using this feature well.<p>In Red Faction: Guerilla, only the buildings/objects are destructible, but there's more physics modeling. Taking out key supports will bring down buildings...in theory. I'm not a structural engineer, so I can't speak for its accuracy, but it often seems as if buildings are much hardier than they should be. Still, it's rather cathartic to take down an entire enemy barracks with a few explosives and a sledgehammer.<p>As for the actual math and methods behind this, I cannot say. I just know how it worked in gameplay from many hours playing the old RF multiplayer, and some recent time put into R:FG. Feel free to ask if you'd like to know more though.<p>(Huh, I never thought my videogame knowledge would be all that relevant here.)",1294253772

2071973,comment,2068105,2068450,0,0,sesqu,,,"Please explain the proper way to form priors, then. 50:50 is widely used, as is ""0 for obviously wrong stuff"". The author here suggested ""something sufficiently close to 0"", which to me is indistinguishable from the second one. Should an accused's guilt prior be based on the jury's own guilt, the number of crimes they've heard about recently, or the judge's conviction rate? Or maybe the accused's socio-economic class?<p>Bayes's rule doesn't help with the point that suggestive evidence is not convincing evidence. It just points out that prior beliefs are part of the equation, but will hopefully pale in comparison to actual data. In fact, I was taught to set practically useless hyperparameters to ensure that they do. No one does that outside of an experiment.<p>Let's say I believe (I don't) the height of pygmies is normally distributed, where the mean is also normally distributed with mean 130cm and standard deviation 10cm, and the standard deviation is inverse gamma distributed with shape 7cm and scale 1cm. Assuming the height is actually normally distributed with mean 160cm and sd 15cm (it isn't), how many pygmies must I measure to admit that P(height>160cm)>20%? I'm not sure I can even do the math.<p>Here P=50% for the unknowable accurate model and P=0.13% for the prior model. How does the situation change when my prior is ""sufficiently close to 0""?",1294253651

I didn't like that, as I felt my own preferences weren't as good as some other readers. This is why I provided users the ability to select and rank book themselves. This is also why each book's detail page has automated searches where you can review what others have said about the book on various hacker sites. I even thought about a voting system, but I'm waiting to see if anybody much uses the site before I go running off with a bunch of features.<p>I thought about tags, but tags are simply not descriptive enough. Questions, as the article author mentions, can be interpreted various different ways. Voting turns into a popularity contest.

As you get older and gain more experience, you start to see the patterns. It's not about the technology, there are repeated themes and solutions. But when you start realizing this and have accumulated 7 years of experience, you may be transitioning out and wanting to begin starting a family. So the people who might be most qualified might be wanting to leave the intensity of coding for the relative stability of management.<p>As someone once said - the entire premise of capitalism is based on overpaying the first few years and underpaying you for the next 20 or 30 years.<p>So perhaps 7 years of experience is a cludgy filter for the relative graybeards who understand that technology is just a tool, not an end.",1294251397

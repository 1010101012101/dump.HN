4739160,comment,4737033,4737635,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Came here to say essentially the same thing. In designing a 400A speed controller for my Battlebot I got to learn all about MOSFETs and their current ratings.<p>In this case the MOSFET is rated with a max current of 5A @ 25 degrees C if the gate is driven with a 5v signal. It has an 80 mOhm resistance when fully enhanced. So at 5A that is 2Watts of power dissipation (p = i^2<i>r) and since the case has a thermal constant of 62 degrees C/W that means the case will be at 149 degrees C (25 + 62 </i> 2W) which causes Rds(on) to double and that 'explodes' the MOSFET. If the device was successfully carrying .5A loads then then the case is only good for about 20mW of power dissipation (which looks reasonable given the package size). So gluing a copper heak sink to the FETs with at least 2 sq inches of surface area would probably keep them alive with a .75A load. If you combined that with about 150 CFM of air flow at sea level (225 CFM at 8,000 ft) you'd stay pretty solidly inside the 'not to be exploding' parts of the parameter graphs.",1352011807

Was it a sign of a design flaw? Of possible risks with gas vehicles generally? Or was driving down the Interstate just more than it could handle?<p>""Based on photographs of the scene obtained by the blog Jalopnik, Fiskers cars were parked fairly close together, so whatever the initial cause, a fire in one car could quickly spread to others.""<p>So it's possible one car sparked all of this, though we'll have to wait for a real investigation to maybe know anything.<p>But it's weird to point to electric cars and hybrids as a scary fire hazard. Have they forgotten the 15-20 or more gallons of super flammable liquid normal cars carry with them everywhere? These cars _work_ by containing _fire_. Hell, sometimes something in the 12V circuit gets hot and a car goes up in flames, no gas or fancy lithium-ion batteries needed.<p>I seem to remember a recall or two over faulty ignition wiring leading to fires in gas-powered cars in perfectly normal weather, but I can't find the one I'm thinking of in the sea of all the others Google turns up.",1352009185

I don't mean to be glib - it turns out to be a damnably hard problem that's been battled by thousands for centuries.  There's easily enough modeling, math, and intellectual know-how going into it to make it a fine engineering discipline (albeit ununified).  Heck, the quants basically weaponized it into a science.<p>Of couse, the real problem is which model(s) to use, <i>since that affects the system</i>.  The answer to that is probably ""all of them"", picking whichever one seems more appropriate.  I'm thinking like a physicist here: sometimes you ignore gravity, and sometimes you ignore wave-partical duality.",1352009103

A carrier could still pay a $150-200 subsidy and give you the phone for free, and people would lap it up.<p>I think people are looking at this from the wrong side. In the US, they don't sell you a phone with a service contract attached: they sell you a service contract with a bonus phone. Yes, Google or Amazon could give away phones for free to eliminate the value of the bonus phone, but you still need a strong alternative to contracts for service.<p>Currently you have carriers like T-Mobile that offer semi-decent prepaid service, although it's been hampered by technological issues (the band they use for 3G is incompatible with iPhones, although supposedly they're in the process of changing it). Why are so many people still buying contracts, though? Is it really just because of the subsidized phones? I'm not convinced.<p>Furthermore, Europe already has a very competitive phone service market, with extremely popular prepaid plans that are far cheaper than anything you can get in the US, and no locked phones; and they achieved all of this without resorting to phone dumping.<p>For all these reasons, I think selling phones at or below price has nothing to do with disrupting the American carrier model (which hardly makes sense for Google or Amazon anyway - they're not even in that industry!).",1352009062

And touch was slick and integrated all the way up the stack.<p>I think the only question now is how many other companies can move fast enough? It took Apple the better part of the last decade to develop the hardware + software to where they are today. It makes Samsung's alleged copying make a lot of sense considering how far ahead Apple is.<p>Personally I'd really like to see more competition. Hopefully hi-res LCDs, good UI design, good industrial design, and rapid innovation become common. Also, if everyone is doing ""rounded corners"" or whatever it is next year, Apple won't have all the patents and will be forced to cross-license. I admit it's not all going to be as rosy as this. But this is better than what happened in the 90's.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3002272/top-dell-exec-why-his-company-didnt-invent-ipad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/3002272/top-dell-exec-why-his-com...</a>",1352009000

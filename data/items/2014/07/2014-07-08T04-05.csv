Two things we do at ZP in this vein are:<p>(1) Each person in the company does customer support on a regular basis. In our hiring process, we screen for folks that care about our customer and the pain point we&#x27;re solving. This means they&#x27;re excited to interact with our customers and help them (vs. viewing it as a chore).<p>(2) Our customer support team is within our product organization. We are available to help you by email, phone, etc. and our goal is to provide the best service possible (with the same mindset on how we&#x27;ve built the product). But, as soon as the call ends, we strive to figure out how to prevent that specific call from ever happening again. The feedback our support team provides engineering and product managers is critical to customer-centric product development.<p>I think a lot of businesses confuse customer-centric product development as meaning that you should build whatever a customer asks for. Our goal is to truly understand our customers pain points, and then fix them, and often this means creating something that&#x27;s never existed before (vs. just building a better/faster/cheaper version of what already exists).<p>btw, we love hearing from customers and we appreciate any and all feedback!

I describe it as &quot;a functional language written by people whose jobs depended on it&quot;.<p>OTP (effectively, production runtime library and development patterns) is built on really sound engineering principles, and you can learn a lot from the explanation of why you build things a particular way while reading the pirate book.<p>EDIT:<p>The main reason that the functional aspects of Erlang are so cool when contrasted with Haskell or Scala or whatever is that they are so deeply tied into how the language functions in a production setting. It&#x27;s not a matter of &quot;my, how clever&quot;, but more of &quot;oh, that makes implementing this reilably a shit-ton simpler&quot;.<p>As an example: actors in Erlang (processes there) are implemented as side-effect free functions which accept messages and manually pass state around. <i>As a consequence</i>, we get code hot-loading for free--you can simply swap out the update functions and run a helper to update the actor state before resuming it&#x27;s run cycle using the new update function.<p>That&#x27;s wicked cool, and is something that just falls out from the pragmatic language decisions made earlier in its history.",1404794559

As with any asset, there are a variety of factors that might result in buyers paying a premium. An investor with the ability to purchase rights associated with an Elvis Presley song, for instance, would probably pay substantially more for each dollar in royalties than they would for rights associated with a song by a less famous artist.<p>Second, and most importantly, not all royalties are tied to CD and digital music sales. These are mechanical royalties. There are also performance and synchronization royalties, which can be significant. It&#x27;s is entirely possible, for instance, for a song that generates little in the way of mechanical royalties to generate eye-popping performance or synchronization royalties.",1404793031

From a business and interoperability perspective, building a platform is definitely a good move. They&#x27;ll be able to create an &quot;email App Store&quot; for developers to publish apps built on their platform, and they can take a cut of revenue.<p>I imagine the play here is to 1) build the API, 2) build a pluggable skeleton of a frontend, 3) chase the enterprise for huge swaths of customers with unique email needs (hence the emphasis on Exchange servers), and 4) recruit developers with the value prop of making money building apps on the API and selling them to enterprise customers.<p>I suspect the final product will look more like Google apps than it will gmail.

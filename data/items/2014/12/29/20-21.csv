8811736,comment,8810382,8811024,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"Code doesn&#x27;t capture <i>intent</i> in many critical cases, so figuring out what a piece of code is supposed to do is different from figuring out what it does. This is true in part because there are very different levels of abstraction involved.<p>To take a trivial example:<p>norm = sqrt(x[0]<i></i>2 + x[1]<i></i>2 + x[2]<i></i>2)\nx[0] /= norm\nx[1] /= norm\nx[2] /= norm<p>This could be described as &quot;take the square root of the sum of three values and then divide each value by the result&quot; or &quot;renormalize a vector&quot;. The latter is by far the more meaningful and useful description because it is presented at the level of abstraction that the user is likely interested in.<p>You could say &quot;well why not create a function called &#x27;renormalize_vector&#x27; so it would be self-documenting?&quot; Fine, but now you have a function call per renormalization and that has a cost that may be unacceptable. For many simulations renormalizing vectors with a norm near unity is a big overhead, to the extent that I&#x27;ve written custom code to handle that special case and implement it as a macro that I could call &quot;FAST_RENORM_NEAR_UNITY&quot;... but what does &quot;near unity&quot; mean? And what trade-offs went into the design choices? What code <i>isn&#x27;t there</i> because I tried it and it didn&#x27;t work well?<p>People who advocate self-documenting code generally talk as if self-documenting techniques come at zero cost (adding a function call is an unacceptably high cost in some cases) and that the code that exists adequately captures all the thinking that went into it (it does not and cannot.)<p>So while I&#x27;m all for as much self-documentation as possible, any non-trivial code is going to require additional documentation to a) describe the purpose in high-level terms and b) capture the alternatives that were rejected and why.<p>Unfortunately, for open source projects especially, there is a law of documentation that says power*documentation=constant, so the most powerful code has the worst documentation, and there are projects with great documentation that simply don&#x27;t do much.",1419886723

So yeah, you can &quot;hold a good conversation&quot; via Skype, but you still have to plan the call, set up a time, etc. There&#x27;s friction to spontaneous collaboration, and spontaneous collaboration is what people really care about when they talk about the benefits of in-person work.<p>Programmers tend to want to squirrel themselves away and work on stuff to maximize their own personal productivity, whereas <i>organizations</i> want to get a bunch of people working at a <i>group optimum</i>. That means that every individual takes a productivity hitÂ for communication purposes, but that the organizational output is much higher than any individual could achieve. Hence, we get the fruitless debates about working conditions: what you see as interruption might be, from the context of the company you work for, be the most globally productive use of your time.<p>There&#x27;s definitely a fine line between communication and distraction and it&#x27;s hard to hit the balance (I&#x27;ve worked in some horrible &quot;open-plan&quot; environments too), but in my experience, programmers nearly always err on the side of too little communication, especially early in their career.",1419886697

A critical flaw is that most of the &quot;solutions&quot; mentioned assume you&#x27;re all working at the same time. (Skype, G+ Hangouts, chatrooms.) That may be ok for workers living in less expensive parts of America or the western hemisphere, but that certainly doesn&#x27;t hold true for overseas workers, which is what Paul Graham is mostly talking about with immigration.<p>An 8-12 hour timezone gap is not something easily bridged by chatrooms and videoconferences. To even have a conversation with the remote worker/team, one or both of you need to schedule time at very early or late hours and even then you only get a little bit of overlap. For the most part you are left to collaborate by email or blogs -- which is a <i>significantly</i> degraded way of collaborating, much moreso than just not being face-to-face. Without an easy way to have a realtime conversation, closing the loop on an issue can take 24 hours.. or several <i>days</i> if there is a lot of back and forth.<p>This style of working can be very difficult in a highly dynamic, less structured, fast moving startup environment. It is not magically solved by &quot;modern communication tools&quot; or high-latency asynchronous working styles. The fundamental issue is.. daylight and human sleep schedules.<p>I wish all conversations about remote work would qualify which context they&#x27;re talking about -- near or far timezones -- instead of just lumping it all together as &quot;remote work from anywhere&quot;.",1419886370

8811584,comment,8806389,8810861,0,0,sho_hn,,,"I originally started with web resources, but here&#x27;s the stuff I credit with really advancing me properly, roughly in the order I read or used it:<p>1. TTMIK&#x27;s <i>Hangeul Master</i>. It&#x27;s really easy to pick up hangul basics so spending $20 on a book that&#x27;s superficially just about the alphabet might seem silly. But the harder part to learn isn&#x27;t really the symbols, it&#x27;s the pronunciation. You need to get to grips with the various sound change rules that apply when various characters are adjacent to each other, and with the pronunciation differences between the normal and tense consonants, and so on. If you can&#x27;t look at a word and confidently form its sound in your head you can&#x27;t read or write efficiently, so this is crucial. TTMIK&#x27;s book is really a solid package: You get the basics (the symbols, the stroke order, etc.) but also a good introduction to the sound change rules, not just on paper but also in really well-done supplementary audio resources and quizzes (where many books fail). Finally there&#x27;s a second section on various Korean handwriting styles that I found surprisingly useful (Korean TV shows and other materials often use pen scripts that can be hard to read without spending some time with this).<p>2. To complement the above, the Korean Wiki Project has a lot of good sound files for various character combinations.<p>3. Billy Go&#x27;s two <i>Korean Made Simple</i> books are just great. They&#x27;re highly accessible introductions to core grammar and core vocab, with short, digestible chapters that gently build on each other (and some useful appendices, like another very complete overview over sound change rules). This is the sort of hand-holding you need to start to be able to find your way around in sentences, form your own, and develop a solid basis from which to attack more advanced areas.<p>4. <i>Korean Grammar in Use</i> is another excellent book series. It doesn&#x27;t do hangul or vocab, instead focussing on numerous grammar forms. It&#x27;s well-structured and benefits from great page layout, and is exactly what you need after Go&#x27;s books to progress further. It&#x27;s in English, but written by native authors and originates in the Korean university world. It&#x27;s a bit harder to get ahold off; I got mine from Korean sellers on Amazon without problems though.<p>5. The <i>Integrated Korean</i> series has a deservedly good reputation as being suitable for self-study and being well-rounded and comprehensive. I agree it&#x27;s good material that you want to look at, especially for practice (it has work books), but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re as accessible as Go&#x27;s books, and not as well-structured as <i>Korean Grammar in Use</i>. I think it&#x27;s best to start this series as supplementary fodder after the above.<p>6. I&#x27;ve used Anki flashcards for vocab training, but I don&#x27;t feel like flashcards work well for me. I find it hard to retain words without sufficient context. The vocab I pick up while reading about grammar sticks much better. To really bulk up on vocab I recommend studying enough grammar so you can dissect even more complicated sentences, and then start reading prose with the aid of a dictionary. Get some children&#x27;s book or YA fiction and work your way up.<p>7. Make sure you listen to some audio-only resources, not just TV shows. Some of the Korean phonemes are superficially similar to Western ones, but formed with slightly different tongue positions, and because of the McGurk effect (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0#t=86"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0#t=86</a>) you can actively hear them wrong when you look at speakers&#x27; faces. Once you know enough hangul and grammar and vocab to have a hope of keeping up with spoken Korean, bulk up on audio. TTMIK has a lot of conversational resources. That said, watching TV shows and stuff is of course good fun anyway, and especially variety shows often have on-screen subtitles featuring the key terms of what&#x27;s being said, which makes for great learning material ...<p>8. Subscribe to the /r/korean sub-reddit and read the questions and answers/discussion. You&#x27;ll learn a lot from that and make lots of interesting connections.<p>9. For practice, use Hello Talk (chatting with natives) and Lang 8 (write longer texts and get corrections by natives). There&#x27;s of course also &quot;go to Korea and immerse yourself&quot;, but not everyone has that luxury.",1419884516

8811577,comment,8810382,8811318,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"He was right. In terms of sustained effort and difficulty, writing a novel is comparable to getting a PhD or creating and shipping a major embedded application from the bare metal on up. Maybe be more difficult.<p>Getting a PhD requires considerable persistence and a modicum of intelligence, but there are supporting and sustaining systems that make it easier. You have an advisor and a committee who in the best of all possible worlds give you guidance and encouragement. And while there are those who will make fun of you for not being in the &quot;real world&quot; they will also envy you a bit and respect what they presume to be your unusually large cranial capacity. That kind of ego-boost helps. It&#x27;s positive feedback on how you&#x27;re spending your life.<p>Building any new application is daunting, but even as the technical lead on a computer-assisted surgery system that went from nothing to giving surgeons real-time image guidance in the OR, I had investors, domain experts, and my team all giving me feedback and support and help in dozens of different ways.<p>Writing a novel is incredibly lonely. You do it all by yourself, every day, for years on end, with no positive feedback from anyone. I don&#x27;t ascribe much value to writing workshops, which I think exist solely as an ameliorative to the profound loneliness of the novelist&#x27;s life. A first reader or two who you can trust to give you small pieces of critical feedback on early drafts is what you really need.<p>Workshops tend to produce work that feels workshopped: stripped of individuality and weirdness for the sake of responding to the demands of the loudest--and frequently most conventional--voices in the room. If you listen to the quieter voices you&#x27;ll find that some people love what others hate. You have to write to please yourself, and that is almost pathologically egotistical. Most people simply aren&#x27;t arrogant enough to say, &quot;My artistic vision is so important to me that I&#x27;m willing to spend thousands of hours entirely alone doing enormously difficult work to realize it.&quot;<p>The technical complexity of novels is also unparalleled. My PhD was in an area where the data were a mess and the theories proved the truth of the maxim that &quot;theorists have never had any trouble explaining the results of experiment, even when those results later proved to be incorrect&quot;. The phenomena driving the whole field later turned out to be an artifact of borderline-fraudulent statistical analysis by the team who &quot;discovered&quot; it. So finding a coherent narrative through the conflicting claims in the literature was extremely challenging, on top of the usual difficulties of performing a novel and interesting precision measurement to test one particular theory. But moving a handful of characters through a series of events and choices that carry them toward a satisfying climax is at least as difficult, and made more-so because there are no fixed points. You can do anything. Without constraints, the writer&#x27;s discipline is the only thing keeping the narrative whole.<p>Furthermore, a novel is &quot;technical complexity all the way down&quot;. Every sentence, every word, every punctuation mark is an opportunity to screw up, to make a mistake that will jar the reader out of the continuous dream of the story. I&#x27;ve been writing since I was in my early teens, and thirty years of practice was still barely enough.<p>Most novelists will tell you that the first novel is the worst, because there&#x27;s really no way of understanding the process without doing it, and I agree with that. If you think you want to write, you should start now, at whatever age you are. Get that first novel behind you. Write it. Re-write it. Edit it. Polish it. Publish it. It&#x27;ll be worth it, if that&#x27;s what you really want to do with your life. And technical people really should write, both fiction and non-fiction: it is a great way of exploring and ordering your ideas.<p>All that said, was it worth it for me? Definitely. I learned more about writing and the ideas I was exploring than I could have any other way. Whether the end product is worth it for anyone else is left as an exercise for the interested reader: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/B00KBH5O8K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419883261&sr=8-1&keywords=darwin%27s+theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/...</a>",1419884414

Every function f(x) is a type of model (e.g. mx+b, x^2, e^x, ln(x), cos(x), |x|,  etc.), and understanding the function f(x) will allow you to model <i>any</i> phenomenon that exhibits f(x)-like behaviour.<p>[note: I&#x27;m working on the web copy for a math book and trying to decide what to put above the fold to make the average Internet reader interested in math. So far the shortlist of pitches are (1) learn math easily because the book is short and written in a chill tone, (2) destroy your calculus and mechanics exams (for students), (3) get rid of <i>math phobia</i> (for English kids), and (4) gain modelling superpowers.  So far I like (4) the best. What do y&#x27;all think? Any feedback would be much appreciated. ]",1419884315

But if you&#x27;d rather just code, or even just watch TV (the very epitome of unproductive wastefulness - but the typical blog probably achieves very little more), that&#x27;s fine too.

From the readme on the github project [2]:<p>>FSE is a new kind of Entropy encoder, based on ANS theory, from Jarek Duda.<p>>It is designed to compete with Huffman encoder and Arithmetic ones.<p>>While huffman is fast but can only represent probabilities in power of 2 (50%, 25%, etc.) arithmetic coding can represent probabilities with much better accuracy, but requires multiplications and divisions.<p>> FSE solve this dilemma by providing precise probabilities, like arithmetic does, but using only additions, masks and shifts.<p>> This makes FSE faster, on par with Huffman speed, and even suitable for low-power CPU environment.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2013/12/finite-state-entropy-new-breed-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2013/12/finite-state-ent...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/Cyan4973/FiniteStateEntropy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Cyan4973/FiniteStateEntropy</a>",1419883253

If there's really a shortage, the makers ought to be getting paid:  in dollars, not kool aid.<p>This isn't even to mention the ""glory deficit"" that goes with being an employee.  With today's incubator explosion, any decent technologist can own 50%+ of their own company.  If they're going to work for yours, you'd better pay them.  And spend more time glorifying those who want to work as a team, rather than those that chase the CEO/Founder glory (a common blog post written by CEOs, Founders and VCs).",1363816779

5410682,comment,5403988,5405189,3,0,HorizonXP,,,"Sure, that's definitely for some women. But you can also use that to your advantage.<p>An article similar to this came up six months ago, at about the same time I was getting ready to propose to my fiancee. It sparked this comment thread: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4536010"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4536010</a><p>patio11 suggested that I wasn't ""selling"" her correctly. Women want the story, the status, the ""Facebook status"". So that's exactly what I did.<p>I bought her a white gold ring with a purple sapphire. It took me over a month to find the right gemstone. While it may not be as expensive as an equivalent weight/quality diamond, it is incredibly hard to replace, since they're so rare.<p>I also made sure that the white gold was made with palladium instead of nickel + rhodium-plating, since I was concerned about skin irritations. I had it completely custom-made, with the design done in CAD and 3D printed. As an engineer, this was awesome. My fiancee didn't quite appreciate that as much as I did, admittedly, but she did say it was cool.<p>Having done all that, I still spent a lot less money on the actual ring than if I had bought a diamond ring. So with the remaining money, I booked a flight to Rome for a 24 hour trip, to catch her by surprise on her last day of her Europe vacation she was on with her sister. I surprised her in a spot I had coordinated, and I hired a local photographer to take engagement pictures of us throughout Rome.<p>So I didn't buy a diamond, but I did end up spending about the same amount of money. However, I was able to ""sell"" my fiancee on the rarity and authenticity of the ring, and the story of the proposal. To this day, she looks back on the ring, the pictures, and remembers it all fondly.<p>So diamonds may be bullshit, but the story and memories aren't.",1363816562

I wouldn't expect them to release a new Drive app when that requires a separate URL before its integrated into the Drive UI.<p>OTOH, its not unheard of for Google to introduce a new service in a fairly minimal form and rapidly add features once it is deployed. So, that could be the plan (and, of course, both could be true -- this could be an ahead-of-schedule, and less-complete-than-planned deployment of something that was planned to be released in what would have been a fairly minimal form anyway.)",1363816560

The more we've learned, the more we need to know about how to learn. At each level of knowledge we gain knowledge by accessing new knowledge and combining it with what we know. Eventually the supply of new knowledge dwindles and the only tool we can rely on is learning; the only tool we can rely on is that ability to combine knowledge.<p>This is much harder than taking in new knowledge; especially for computers! However, computers are getting better and better at it. Whereas many of us are out of college, computers are still in middle school, but they're getting better and better at both large scale and high complexity learning, so they'll move on to high school and college soon. Moreover, they're moving at an exponential pace!

Anyone who supports this is a moron. However, there is some truth in the arguments that people are suggest, if you will please hear me out:<p>Recently near me, there was a crime committed by a teacher. This teacher had been having an explicit relationship with pupils, namely in sending digital photos of themselves to students. When this teacher was caught, they were obviously stripped of their teaching and arrested (My country, like many others, has a system where personal relationships between students and teachers must be consensual and the student must be over 18, it is also frowned upon if they are in school together).  When tried and convicted, this teacher got only a few years in prison. This teacher, as I'm sure you've guessed is a female. Now, what do you think the conviction would have been if that was a male teacher? Much higher than a few years I'm sure, additionally there would've been outrage, yet I only heard about it months after the conviction. Don't you see that there are inequalities in life, positive discrimination? I mean, there are laws that there must be X% of women in the boardroom, but I ask you- what if all male the applicants to the job are better than the female ones? Should then the business lose out on a great candidate because the laws force them to choose the worse one?<p>Look, I am not a Men's rights activist, I am not completely anti-feminism, I agree that 'the oppression' that many men see themselves under is merely a fallacy.

So, how do I exist - I have retained & enhanced my sense of humour & I immerse myself in education regarding my favourite subjects which are IT Security & IT Knowledge in general.

We wrestle with clients all the time that want various elements of the platform either directly under their control or as far away as humanly possible. There's usually little rhyme or reason to understanding which components are supposed to go where or for what reason, but that's Telecom in a nutshell.

However, why do benefits packages need to be uniform?<p>I personally hate having ""benefits"" in my compensation which come out of my salary which I don't really want.  Sometimes companies get tax savings (i.e. they can deduct, I can't), but VERY RARELY do they get actual dollar savings (health insurance is one weird case, due to some people being more expensive to insure than they could ever pay, and that risk being spread across a group).<p>My personal ideal benefits package is:
0) Private office, 24x7 hvac, a door, decent security, locking storage, parking on-site ideally with a guard or gate.  Essentially non-negotiable (or, wfh).  EV parking would be nice too soon.<p>1) Max 401k match and maybe even profit sharing (in California, I'd happily take $1 of salary and put it into employer 401k match) -- I think you can get up to 46k/yr max, so 15k personal contribution, 5% salary match, and the rest as profit share up to 46k.<p>2) FSA, Transportation accounts (fully deductible for employer, and non-taxed).  I ended up buying a bunch of air filters and condoms when I had an FSA, and I guess I could find a use for a TSA.<p>3) As much hardware as I realistically can use ($10-20k/yr -- not just computers, but I'd love to have a budget for a hw lab).  Someone recently questioned whether a $4k per developer laptop budget was legitimate, and I seriously question why someone would deny a $1-2k marginal expense on a worker generating >$500k/yr in returns.<p>4) Conference/books/etc. (time is the big cost for the company there, not the cost) -- and ""if you're speaking at a conference related to work, we cover nice travel)<p>5) Free food/etc. (i.e. RG's ""unlimited Seamless"").  Bad food is of negative value, since I'll feel obligated to eat it.<p>6) Decent travel when travel is required.  Not first class, but helping you make it less painful -- either letting you do your own bookings (I'm better than any corp travel agent I've used), or doing it for you.  Optimize for ff status.  I pretty much need a $65/day car vs. a $30/day car (and tend to pay for the upgrade out of pocket when it's not covered), but would in exchange prefer a more complex $300 routed ticket vs. a $500 direct flight, and would stay on starwood points sometimes vs. paying cash.<p>7) I prefer to keep my health insurance <i>separate</i> from the company, for practical and philosophical reasons.  (I pay $118/mo for better coverage than ~any company I've seen).  Give me $5k/yr into my HSA instead, and pay any other marginal insurance benefit to me as extra salary or more RAM or something.<p>8) Use of company resources for personal projects (e.g. hosting a tech user's group, or helping friends launch their own startups by letting them use conference rooms when meeting with people, etc.  etc.<p>I'm curious if people are ""picky"" like me, or would just prefer a bunch of benefits as a package.  There are HR reasons to give everyone the same thing, but IMO one of the advantages of being a small startup is being able to customize packages for people.  If I hired someone with sick kids, I'd obviously make sure there were a group health insurance plan for him or her.  If I hired someone who was on an H1B or otherwise needed citizenship sponsorship, I'd call in favors with undersecretaries to write letters on his behalf.  etc.  There's no need for a small company to act like a megacorp.",1363815626

If you compare the compensation for being an early employee in such a startup with working for an established company (eg Google, Facebook) then I think you'll find the employee of the latter will be better off in the long term 95% of the time and by a significant margin (disclaimer: I work for Google).<p>Now some people and some ideas can genuinely attract people to work for peanuts. I remember hearing about Square, then valued at $40m with their first round of funding (IIRC) and thinking ""man I'd give anything to work for them"" given the idea and the track record (Jack Dorsey basically).<p>The problem I think is that many startups think they have this kind of cachet just because they worked for Facebook in 2006. Social proof counts for something but it doesn't make you a great entrepreneur. Being a great entrepreneur makes you a great entrepreneur and that means running some kind of company that had some kind of impact (and, ideally, some significant exit).<p>Startups aren't for financial security. They are for the frontiermen who are hoping to strike it rich in the gold rush. Most don't but some do.<p>To the OP: you make very valid points and given your circumstances and preferences (and mine FWIW), I agree: working for an established company will give you a far better expected financial outcome at lower risk.<p>EDIT: I should clarify that there are of course non-financial reasons to work for a small startup. Less bureaucracy, it can be exciting, variety of work, degree of impact and so on.<p>A lot of people are willing to make those tradeoffs and sacrifice some financial return for the privilege. This isn't unique to the startup world. Games programmers, for example, typically get paid crap (until you get to be the lead developer on a big title and get a % of the revenue, etc).<p>All of this is simply supply and demand.<p>That all being said, living without health insurance in the US is incredibly risky. Generally only large employers have the clout to negotiate good plans with providers for reasonable premiums.<p>The other stuff (extra PTO, conferences especially, etc) are more luxuries than necessities but they do of course contribute to the overall financial outcome.",1363815623

I had a ""client"", or a ""contractor"", I was obligated to fulfill. I only got paid if I did so, and I only got more contract jobs if I did a good job.<p>2. When one contract was over, I had to run out and find another one. While doing so, I was making exactly nothing. If I timed things right, I'd go from one contract to another, but that's not always possible, so I'd have a week or so of dead time where I should have been making money, but didn't.<p>3. If I was sick, there wasn't a team of structure in place to deal with it. I was sick. I didn't get paid. It sucked. Often it meant I had to do double-shift days to make up the lost time.<p>4. There was absolutely no ""reward"". There was just a steady, sometimes unsteady, stream of money, which worked out to about what I'd make salaried somewhere after I factor in everything.<p>5. As a salaried employee, I was still completely free to quit. No one could ""make"" me stay at a job I hated. And there aren't many (if any) legal ramifications of doing so. However, as a contractor, I might have a legal obligation (literally a contract), and the client had a completely valid way to sue me if I broke contract by not completing the work. Some clients demanded real contracts for long-term projects, and that absolutely sucked.<p>6. Founder spend payroll? Great. Contract abruptly ended.

Many people think the greatest winners of globalization today are financiers. A decade or so ago, that may have been true. But today another class sits above even themthe global commodity plutocrats: owners of mineral rights, or dominant players in mineral-rich countries in sectors such as construction and finance that benefit from commodity booms. Hollingsworth notes in Londongrad that the oligarchs he studies became rich not by creating new wealth but rather by insider political intrigue and exploiting the weakness of the rule of law. Arkady Gaydamak, a Russian-Israeli oilman and financier, explained his elite view of accumulating wealth to me in 2005. With all the regulations, the taxation, the legislation about working conditions, there is no way to make money, he said. It is only in countries like Russia, during the period of redistribution of wealthand it is not yet finishedwhen you can get a result. . . . How can you make $50 million in France today? How?<p>Russias former privatization czar Anatoly Chubais put it less delicately: They steal and steal. They are stealing absolutely everything.<p>London real-estate agents confirm that these commodity plutocrats dethroned the financiers some time before the financial crisis hit. I cant remember the last time I sold a property to a banker, says Stephen Lindsay, of the real-estate agency Savills. Its been hard for anyone to compete with the Russians, the Kazakhs. They are all in oil, gasthat is what they do. Constructionall that kind of stuff.<p>Even the Arab money has taken a backseat to the new buyers, says Hersham. The wealth of the ex-Soviets is incredible, he says. Unless you are talking about [Goldman Sachs C.E.O. Lloyd] Blankfein or [Stephen Schwarzman], the head of Blackstone, or the head of one of the very big banks, there is no driver from the City of London at these levels anymore.",1363815443

5410463,comment,5391667,5409012,25,0,bobwaycott,,,"Hey, thanks for the compliment and kind words. I appreciate that.<p>However, I must emphatically and proudly express that I do not support the negation and devaluing of women's (as well as ethnic, [other] cultural, LGBT, etc.) rights by way of reactionary countering with a ""men's rights"" movement.<p>One of the most pressing reasons is that such a movement would likely result in a majority of white, heterosexual male adherents (at least here in the US). From a historical perspective alone, males of nearly all notable ethnicity have dominated the world stage in terms of rights, privileges, and power--and white, heterosexual males in particular. This undeniably central component of human history (especially as it leads to Western modernity) is a primary motivator on my part to refrain from supporting an ideological, social, or economic (read: material) crusade that would pose a serious threat to the hard-won and valiantly fought-for progress that has been made in the human condition over the past century+. It could be possible that a notable minority male demographic would join such a movement, but at least in the US, such calls for ""men's rights"" are typically laden with reactionary white men who feel somewhat despondent at figuring out how to navigate in a world that, at least in words, tries very hard to no longer privilege that genetic inheritance.<p>More abstractly, a ""men's rights"" movement would, I think, offer very little gain to humanity as a whole, and would threaten to destabilize and retard the advancement of human rights and greater gender and sexual equality in social relations. This would be a terrible regression to allow to happen. Even when people like Adria raise the red flag in a moment of haste that, I think, will later be reflected on as regrettable, it is still done (I hope) from a position of sincere concern for protecting those who are actual victims of bigoted, discriminatory behaviors.<p>On this particular issue, I am disheartened to see the fallout from her overreaction, especially as her actions have affected three children, their father, and (assuming she is present) their mother. One woman's dislike of a comment that she mistook for sexist antagonism (or some emotional reaction in the same vein (also: I'm not using 'emotional' in a pejorative sense here)) has now affected five lives. Moreover, in reading her blog post on the subject, it threads through a story of a person who has been hyper-traveling from conference to conference, is exhausted, has already dealt with a person <i>on the same day</i> making a completely inappropriate and objectifying joke/comment that is absolutely inexcusable, and <i>then</i> she basically takes it out on a couple of guys who said something which, given their own statements and the available evidence, bears every indication that she basically went in, guns blazing, to the wrong fight. What is most important is this: the guy who made a comment <i>directly to her</i> about looking under a [table] skirt and finding it ""bare, just the way [he] liked it"" DID NOT have a picture posted to Twitter and a massive call-to-the-carpet moment. She talked to him. She even told him the comment could be funny in a different venue (her own admission).<p>The evidence available leaves the distinctly bad taste that the punishment did not fit this crime, while a much more serious issue in which she actually spoke to the offender directly was apparently cause for discussing the comedic appropriateness of a shaved vulva at a tech conference.<p>Moreover, to go back toward the philosophical end of things, this brief quote from Wikipedia provides a decent enough look at exactly what is meant by the Marxist understanding of gendered disparities in social equality:<p>><i>Marxist feminism's foundation is laid by Friedrich Engels in his analysis of gender oppression ... a woman's subordination is not a result of her biological disposition but of social relations, and that men's efforts to achieve their demands for control of women's labor and sexual faculties have gradually solidified and become institutionalized in the nuclear family. Through a Marxist historical perspective, Engels analyzes the widespread social phenomena associated with female sexual morality, such as fixation on virginity and sexual purity, incrimination and violent punishment of women who commit adultery, and demands that women be submissive to their husbands. Ultimately, Engels traces these phenomena to the recent development of exclusive male control of private property and the attendant desire to ensure that their inheritance is passed only to their own offspring: chastity and fidelity are rewarded, says Engels, because they guarantee exclusive access to the sexual and reproductive faculty of women possessed by men from the property-owning class.</i>[1]<p>We are, on even our worst days as a society, nowhere near a state of affairs in which that synopsis can swap the gendered pronouns and hold true.<p>I hope that provides a bit more context, as well as a decent enough grappling with why, given how much social inequality actually still exists to be eradicated, a ""men's rights"" movement is nothing that needs to be on the table.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_feminism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_feminism</a>",1363814747

Scrum is a methodology, or process, based on those principles.<p>Comment: For my teams, Scrum has worked more effectively than other processes.*  The point of my post was not that ""Agile works, if only people would do it right"".  That is a misinterpretation.  The point was that over-complication (by way of, for example, a 478 page book) makes having it be an effective process for a team more difficult.  Perhaps the reason it's worked for my teams is because I have focused on keeping it simple.<p>Question: Obviously, you think Agile and Scrum are nonsense.

You are not the arbiter of how to have a good conversation, but the nominal go-to person for Ember.js documentation. From a cold reading (ie not being an Ember.js user and not knowing any of the participants in the discussion), my reading of Delvarworld's commentary is that s/he worked to soften the blow of his/her criticisms by couching them in gentle humor, and describing systematically the thought process and frustration encoutnered in trying to get to grips with this tool. A lot of people would have just said 'this sucks/is stupid' or something worse.<p>Slapping the poster down in public without any attempt at a substantive response, and then sending a long private explanation of how you should be communicated is a major dick move.* You are arbitrarily setting yourself up as a superior being and deflecting wholly valid criticism by making such public pronouncements. Following up with a private message is not much better, because it prevents the recipient from having the issue out with you without breaking the implicit confidentiality of email.<p>* Since you referred upthread to 'dickitide' I am presuming the term 'dick move' is not going to be offensive to you.<p>Your role as a community member is not to lecture other people in how they may address you (within reason, there's no reason you should have to tolerate outright abuse), but to exemplify the standards you wish to propagate. If you use community standards as a shield to deflect substantive criticisms of your work, voluntary or not, then you are undermining those very standards by using them for exclusionary purposes. The fact that you are in a distinct minority in this discussion and are defending your position by arguing that dickitude is the norm and you are the exception ought to serve as a red flag for you.<p>My advice is to apologize to the original poster (ie Delvarworld) for your dismissive reaction and then engage with that poster's substantive criticisms. If you truly feel unable to engage with someone who is engaged in the mildest kind of personal expression, then perhaps being in a liaison position is not for you.<p>In the meantime, I urge you to revisit the Discourse blog article you linked to (where you cited the 'don't be a dick' principle) and keep reading to (at least) the section titled 'Be reasonable, even when you disagree,' which includes a plea to avoid 'responding to a posts tone instead of its actual content.'",1363813737

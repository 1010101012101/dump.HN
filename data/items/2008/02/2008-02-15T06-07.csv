I usually strike conversations up with them - which terrifies my wife, by the way - and most display fairly obvious symptoms of mental illness even in the brief moments I spend with them.  I can't begin to imagine what symptoms they might exhibit if I was around them for longer periods of time.<p>I think mental illness is much more widespread than people realize, and our society really doesn't have an appropriate way to deal with the situation.  I'd like to see this young author try to 'pull himself up by his bootstraps' if he was paranoid schizophrenic and hallucinating.  It's rather hard to interview for a job when you think the interviewer is trying to kill you and you have leeches crawling out of your ears, for example.",1203057941

116353,comment,115350,115350,0,0,h34t,,,"* Interesting idea, to save your best oration until after the first rejection. Does anyone here do this? I can't see it working in most circumstances, but in a boardroom setting where your audience has paid good money for the work you've already done, they're not likely to actually let you leave after 5 minutes regardless of your threats (it was quite a dramatic bluff, I'd say).<p>* His standing up was interesting, but I wouldn't respect it if I were his audience. You can put all your cards on the table with less drama. To me, he was too overtly aggressive & theatrical. It unnecessarily puts the rest of the room on the defensive.<p>*Did anyone else not find the quality of discussion low? Poor logic and superficial, emotional responses. Reminds me why I stopped watching (almost all) television.",1203057190

All our own photo sharing needs are met with what we have but your private school blogging idea makes more sense to me.  There are lots of things you could do.<p>Your site could accept submissions from parents who want their kids to get attention.  Parents could create their own subsets to highlight the events involving their kids.  The school could encourage kids to write their own accounts of the events. The best stuff could automatically go into an online yearbook.  Sell them a $10 compact disk when their kids graduate.<p>One thing to keep in mind if you try to sell something to the schools directly is that they have annual budgets.  The best approach would not be to ask for money upfront but to charge them at the end of whatever ""year"" makes sense for them.<p>One person you may want to focus your efforts on is the school librarian.  The one at the my kids school is also in charge of the library web site.  I'm pretty sure she would be interested in a system that made it easy to organize pictures and discussions of new books along with pictures of the kids.

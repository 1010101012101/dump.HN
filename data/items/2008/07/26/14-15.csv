Giving you ~6'x7' = 49' of linear shelf space.  Your boxes take up 3 linear feet but I go though 2boxes of cereal a week so that's ~1month = $10 3/7th of a square foot a living space.  Or ~230$/month per square foot.",1217083721

257548,comment,257491,257491,0,0,rkts,,,"I wonder if personality has something to do with it.  My guess is that language snobs are INTP, whereas Blub programmers are more INTJ.  From the descriptions at <a href=""http://www.personalitypage.com/portraits.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.personalitypage.com/portraits.html</a>:<p>""INTPs value knowledge above all else. ... They hate to work on routine things - they would much prefer to build complex theoretical solutions, and leave the implementation of the system to others.""<p>By contrast, ""[an INTJ's] primary interest is not <i>understanding</i> a concept, but rather <i>applying</i> that concept in a useful way. Unlike the INTP, they do not follow an idea as far as they possibly can, seeking only to understand it fully. INTJs are driven to come to conclusions about ideas. Their need for closure and organization usually requires that they take some action.""<p>Since INTPs are less motivated to action and ""hate to work on routine things,"" they are driven to higher-level languages, because those languages help them focus on concepts instead of implementation details.  But this means that the people using these languages get little done -- precisely because they are more interested in concepts than in implementation.",1217082599

The UI is of course no problem either.<p>The whole deal seems pointless. Some would claim it's for the userbase, but Digg/Reddit by now have self-selected themselves down to a notoriously bad userbase. Would you pay $200m for those guys?",1217082342

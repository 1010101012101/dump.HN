The most problematic part of this course is its lack of clear outline. It jumps between different fields of machine learning, which could have fundamentally different focuses and motivations, without illustrating the connections to the students. It talks about Watson-Nadaraya classier in the second class, then we have two lectures to explain most basic naive bayes algorithm. I just don&#x27;t get it.<p>Though it gets me confusing a lot of times, the course is useful in a way that gives me a lot of keywords to search for and read article about.Also the homeworks might be challenging some time, working through them did improve my understanding of something I might think trival before, like the linear regression stuff.<p>And if you are really interested, I would recommend a book, which covered most of the materials of the course while being much more organized:<p><a href=""http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/</a><p>A refresher in linear algebra will also help~",1384235837

It&#x27;s purely speculative but maybe you&#x27;ll find some inspiration:<p>Automatically verify everything you can. (billing ZIP matches credit card provider, email at least vaguely resembles an email address, all required fields are filled, etc). Raise a warning only if something is obviously wrong.<p>If the user hasn&#x27;t yet chosen something like shipping options, consider making it a second step. Then you can have a pageflow along the lines of:<p>-User inputs basic information (name, address, email, financial details, everything necessary to know what they ordered and how they will pay for it)
-User is taken to a page where it asks for shipping options, with user&#x27;s stated mailing address printed right next to the form. Have an obvious way to fix the address from this page.
-Print the user&#x27;s email address near the mailing address for the same reason (if you feel the need to justify it, you can have a checkbox that says &quot;send a receipt to <i>email address</i>&quot; or &quot;use <i>email address</i> for package tracking)<p>After an order is complete, take the user to a page that says &quot;Your confirmation number is <i>foo</i>. Please save this page for your records. We will also send a receipt to <i>email_address</i>.&quot; The most visible thing on the page besides that message is their order, with the shipping address in bold. The next obvious is a link on this page they can click if something is wrong. Even if you never use the confirmation number for anything, it gives the customer an excuse to be observant without making them feel stupid.<p>Have a generous cancellation policy. If someone contacts you saying an order is wrong and you&#x27;re positive which order they&#x27;re talking about, let them cancel it. Worry about malicious cancellations only if they prove to be a real problem.",1384234847

For instance, Saddam was defeated very easily, in the very beginning.<p>Self-sacrifice? These wars were strategic failures, in spite of the US&#x27; best efforts, simply because you can&#x27;t defeat guerillas the same way you defeat regular armies. You sound like you haven&#x27;t been paying attention to what has been going on since, well, WWII. How many asymmetrical conflicts have been won by large modern armies since? The various decolonization wars, Vietnam, Afghanistan (you can&#x27;t really accuse Russia of playing soft, there) ended up the same way. The UK were successful in Malaya, and the French had effectively destroyed the operational capabilities of the FLN by the end of the war in Algeria, but even this was not enough to ensure victory. Hell, even in Northern Ireland, it took decades to turn the IRA away from terrorism (and that after it managed to kick the UK out of the rest of Ireland).<p>Asymmetrical warfare is hard. Moreover, suggesting that a &quot;proper war&quot; should be prosecuted, presumably with heightened levels of violence, after hundreds of thousands of people died or were maimed for life is insulting.<p>> That&#x27;s not an argument against what I said. We have no reason to attack South America.<p>Your argument was that in order to defend &quot;freedom&quot; (because, really, these money-laundering rules are just too repressive), the US should attack the issue at the root. Guess what? Most of the money being laundered is drug money. It&#x27;s an absolutely astounding amount of cash.

The supply is fixed - there will never be more than 21,000,000 BTC in circulation so the only other factor is how big you think Bitcoin will become relative to other currencies.<p>For example, there is about 1.22 Trillion USD in circulation. Right now BTC has a market capitalization of $4B which puts it at about 0.3% of USD. If BTC were to become even 5% of USD that would be a 16x increase over where it is now ($330 x 16 = $5500).

Seems to be a case of &quot;a bad mechanic will always blame his tools&quot;.<p>In the right hands MongoDB can be a great asset. The problem here is that Diaspora chose MongoDB when it was very immature and it seems the choice was based on hype more so that mapped out requirements. This is where proper planning for a large scale application will spot these kinds of problems before they get to the development stage.<p>Later versions of MongoDB are much better and the upcoming planned changes will take it many steps in the right direction towards being a viable alternative to a traditional RDBMS. Having said that, it&#x27;s not a silver bullet and MongoDB is not for everything.<p>10Gen are exceptionally great at marketing Mongo and I get the feeling they have kind of trapped Foursquare who have been using it in production for a couple of years or so now. Having said that with exception of that one 11 hour outage Foursquare encountered, MongoDB seems to be working really well for them and they seem to be capturing more than just check-in data.<p>I still think with proper planning pulling off a social network with MongoDB is possible. I am currently building a social networking type application, not on the scale of Facebook but it does share some parallels.

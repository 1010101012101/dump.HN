8673476,comment,8673200,8673404,0,0,jordanthoms,,,"People always seem to prefer Sinatra over Rails for building a SPA backend, because &#x27;rails is overkill&#x27;. Then they add Active Record, some autoloader implementation, rspec, caching, sidekiq etc and you end up with a cobbled together version of rails essentially. Rails-API is really nice here, strips out the things you truly don&#x27;t need for a API in rails but keeps all the other infrastructure.",1417254979

8673470,comment,8673247,8673427,0,0,alephnil,,,"> Isn&#x27;t mention of chaos theory irrelevant?<p>That was my first thought as well, but consider a chaotic system in a Newtonian universe. Laplace&#x27; demon must then have the capability to simulate the universe to be able to predict it. What chaos theory brings is that this simulation would require infinite precision to be done without diverging from reality at some point (and sooner rather than later as the error grows exponentially). Then you could use Cantor&#x27;s diagonalization theorem to prove that no such simulator could exist, even for a finite system, because even a finite system would require an infinitely large state to represent it, and no finitely sized simulator could represent it.",1417254335
8673469,comment,8670544,8672658,0,0,irremediable,,,"I can see your point, but:<p>a) You did seem to conflate wealth with unfairness.<p>b) I&#x27;m unsure that a simple mean is the best criterion. The median household income is about $50,000, for example. If an individual earns about $150,000, they&#x27;re in the top decile of the US. I think being in the top decile is also pretty rich.<p>c) If an SF developer is earning $100k, it&#x27;s not even that fair to compare it to household income distribution. If they don&#x27;t have a family, they don&#x27;t need to support children -- unlike many households with <i>lower</i> income. If they do have a family, it&#x27;s reasonably likely they have a high-earning partner who&#x27;ll boost their household income even higher. Rich people tend to marry rich people.<p>(I used household income rather than household wealth here, which is a weakness compared to what you wrote. But you get the idea...)",1417254228

Get an introduction wherever possible.<p>1) If nothing else, people who already sell to restaurants understand the market and can introduce you to other owners you can speak with, and<p>2) You probably want a salesperson with industry expertise and existing relationships, rather than someone with App / SaaS experience. Even if they&#x27;ve previously sold produce or tableware or linen services, you can teach them the technical basics and they can sell it in terms that will create cutthrough in the market.<p>Lastly, when people Ask HN about finding a technical co-founder, the advice is nearly unanimous: try learning some of the skills yourself. The same is true of Sales and Business strategy - you may never become an expert, but forcing yourself to learn the basics will help you identify the really good operators in that space.<p>Good luck!",1417252184

In the protocol I describe, the verifier can do that, because revealing more than two vertices simultaneously leaks information that isn&#x27;t necessarily true of all possible solutions (at least, it can; if three vertices which connect in a triangle turn out to be three different colors, you haven&#x27;t learned anything because any valid solution will have that property).<p>The problem I&#x27;m having is that I agree that the one-edge protocol is zero-knowledge (and that a verifier could be tricked indefinitely by a prover with a time machine), and obviously the two-edge protocol isn&#x27;t zero-knowledge (and, in probably-related-but-I&#x27;m-not-sure news), a verifier using the two-edge protocol <i>cannot</i> be tricked indefinitely by a time machine). I can tell that, but I tell it by looking within my soul and thinking &quot;yes, there is no information leak when one edge is revealed, but there is a leak when two edges are revealed&quot;. That&#x27;s not a reliable method; I&#x27;d like to know how to prove that information does not leak through a protocol, and I don&#x27;t see that anywhere in the OP.",1417251701

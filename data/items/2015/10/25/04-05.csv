Still very excited about the thought of getting these devices to places like rural India, combined with things like Khan Academy Lite [0]<p>I don&#x27;t want to be too optimistic about some inevitable miracle once you supply hardware and content, but in general these price levels are indications for what we can expect by 2020. Dirt cheap, ubiquitous devices capable of handling virtually all computing tasks you&#x27;d like say a 14 year old to do, with a rich second-hand market of devices pushing the price even lower.<p>And the energy requirements are ridiculously low. We&#x27;ve seen the latest iPads around 30 watthours, that&#x27;s about 0.3 cents for a full (10 hour) charge at typical retail electricity prices, and this fire tablet looks to be about 1/3rd the battery size but more than 2/3rd the battery life, we&#x27;re probably looking at about 0.015 cents ($0.00015) per hour of use. Tiny solar installations can be sufficient for this level of energy use. I&#x27;m hoping global, low-bandwidth internet that some have proposed in various forms (e.g. Google, FB) will not trail behind much.<p>I mean really, let&#x27;s think about it. It&#x27;s a quad core device with 1 gig of ram and gigabytes of storage (and SD-capable), with a screen, 7 hour battery, keyboard, speaker and connectivity... and with say a 3 year lifetime, it costs you 4 cents per day. In a few years, this level of tech becomes accessible to virtually everyone. We all expected it to happen of course, but still, think back to 2010 when the iPad was introduced at 10x the price ($500+), with a quarter the ram, a lower resolution and slower cpu. Yes it&#x27;s subsidised a bit by the fact it tries to drive Amazon sales after purchase, but still. Who knows where we&#x27;ll be in another five years.<p>[0] <a href=""https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/</a>",1445749009

I.E. referring to the situation we have where you write code in JS and just don&#x27;t know if it will work until runtime when you check if that feature exists.<p>One of the reasons they have to do that for the web is that there is a single module version packaged in the browser for everything anyone could think of to put in the browser, so a &quot;Browser API&quot; version number could not give any information about compatibility of specific sub-APIs.<p>In the context of self-contained, decoupled web assembly modules with specific narrowly defined purposes, semantic versioning will be important.

It happens somewhat frequently, but reads and writes aren&#x27;t constantly reordered.<p>the remapping I&#x27;m talking about happens when a sector goes bad.   if sector 5 fails, it&#x27;s remapped to the bit of disk set aside as spares, no?  no secret there.   but when my computer reads sector 1 through sector 10, my computer thinks it&#x27;s reading sequentially... but really there&#x27;s a big random seek right in the middle of it.

Thing is, one tomato is about 200g total, if you eat that say 5 days a week, you&#x27;re looking at about $0.50 a day. Even if you can cut that price in half by growing it yourself, you&#x27;re saving $7.50 a month, and you&#x27;ll surely easily spend more than 2 hours a month on setting things up, germinating seeds, harvesting etc. At say a quite modest (for HN) $30 salary per hour, you&#x27;re throwing out the window 8x your savings in opportunity cost. So you&#x27;d only really do this if you enjoy it, or if you grow pot.<p>(for pot, you probably get 150g off of a single plant, and prices of $10 a gram are pretty typical. If you grow a plant every few months, it&#x27;s probably worth your time in a world where it&#x27;s legal, although in that world, prices come down pretty fast, too).<p>In short, growing pretty much anything at home can save you money if you value your opportunity cost at 0 (i.e. do it purely for fun). If you actually account for your opportunity cost, it&#x27;s pretty terrible, industrialised farming is just way more efficient. If you enjoy it and have a garden, it can actually save you a few hundred bucks a year, much more than these buckets can (the economics of paying for artificial sunshine rather than using the sun we have makes no sense, nor does the investment in any of the material when you have soil, even just in pots if you have no garden), but you&#x27;ll probably spend a few hours in the garden each weekend and so your hourly wage is beyond crap, you really just have to do it for fun and see the cost savings as a nice surprise. The buckets aren&#x27;t cost effective, they&#x27;re purely for weed, or for fun DIY projects, not for saving money. (they can save some money, again, if you don&#x27;t put a value on your time, but not as well as simply using pots or a garden.)<p>For a quick idea about the cost. Big thing obviously is lighting. A lot of guys use 100W setups for 16-18 hours a day, at a 15c per kwh rate you&#x27;re paying about $7.50 in electricity alone per month. So if you use that setup to grow enough so you can eat 1 tomato every single weekday from your bucket, all else being free, you&#x27;re still saving just $17.50 or so in the shop, and spending $7.50 on lights. So your net benefit is $10 a month. Now imagine your neighbour offered you a job to build him a bucket (for free, with your own money), and pay you $10 a month to tend the tomato plant in his bucket, you&#x27;d say hell no, but those are really the economics (ignoring the fact you may think it&#x27;s fun and do it even if it saves you no money at all). At a slightly bigger scale it can make sense but again, you&#x27;d really rather just have a small garden, plant multiple crops, not setup any electrical work or anything and pay no extra electricity. And at a huge scale it makes no sense whatsoever, i.e. if you do this to sell to other people, your production costs are waaaaay higher than a normal farm.",1445747811

10445959,comment,10445696,10445696,0,0,my_username_is_,,,"Interesting question.<p>I would say that yes, startups (as a whole) are likely diluting their own markets. When a startup notices a real pain point and tries to solve it, but cannot make a sustainable business out of it, it shakes the customers&#x27; trust in trying an unproven company. This can have negative consequences.<p>Think of it this way: currently, people have faith in the &#x27;startup brand&#x27;. A potential customer&#x27;s internal monologue may be something like: &quot;Oh a startup is trying to solve this problem that I have? They&#x27;re probably doing something really innovative and they&#x27;re inevitably going to build a successful company because of it.&quot; After the same customer gets burned a couple times by a new company shutting down, they&#x27;re not going to be as likely to put their faith in the next new company that comes around the block. The &#x27;startup brand&#x27; to them comes to mean a bunch of naive kids who will fail in the next year or so. Even if this company can do it better than before, it may not be worth the risk of frustration/headaches/delays that using the old startups&#x27; software has caused them in the past, so they choose to not try the new product. This makes user acquisition a lot harder, and I&#x27;d imagine that it would be a net negative (when compared to a scenario where the weak startups didn&#x27;t try to start a company).",1445746584

That is, individuals “strive for a positive self-concept”.<p>Are you proud to be an American, where at least you&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re free? If so, are you a Democrat, Republican, Green, Libertarian, or something else?<p>Are you proud to be Irish? A Son of Scandinavia? A Daughter of the American Revolution? Do you say it loud that you are black and proud?<p>Are you a Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, or member in another religion? (You don&#x27;t need to think it makes sense, only that you follow religious practices.)<p>Are you a Ramblin&#x27; Wreck from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer? An Aggie? A Boomer Sooner? Proud alumni of Wossamotta U?<p>Are you a little monster? Juggalo? Parrothead? Deadhead? Belieber? Fanilow? Member of the KISS army?<p>A sporto, motorhead, geek, slut, blood, wastoid, dweeb, or dickhead?<p>Fan of any sports team?<p>Are you a runner? Cyclist? Swimmer? Triathlete? Dancer? Skier?<p>Trekkie? Trekker? SF fan? Con goer? Filker? Otaku?<p>Employee? True Blue employee of IBM? When you get cut, do you bleed in 6 colors? Are you an entrepreneur? Agileist? Extreme programmer? RAD programmer?<p>Citizen? Taxpayer? Loving parent? Faithful child?<p>While some of these are certainly facts - everyone is a child - identity comes into play when there are actions used to achieve what you consider to be a positive distinctiveness.<p>For possible examples: you are a Muslim so you fast for Ramadan. You wear the jersey of a favorite sports team. You have figurines from your favorite series on your desk. You fly the flag on independence day. You wear green on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. You are Catholic and get marked on the forehead for Ash Wednesday. You call your mother on her birthday because it&#x27;s something a good child should do. You give money to beggars because it&#x27;s what a good citizen with a bit of extra money should do. You ... well, you get the idea.<p>On the flip side, students may be required to run as part of P.E. class. They are &quot;runners&quot; in the sense that they are run, but they might not identify as a &quot;runner&quot; if they don&#x27;t consider it a positive distinctiveness.<p>I see from your comments that you consider yourself to be a programmer. It&#x27;s something you do in your free time. If you had the money to be financially independent, you would do more programming. You are on a discussion forum for &quot;hackers&quot;.<p>Why should I believe that you don&#x27;t identify as being a programmer?<p>Do you really not notice how identity issues pervade human culture?",1445746475

Definitely not to remove the smell of your strawberry plants :p<p>Beyond that, the economics of vegetables and such prevent lighting like this from being profitable. Consider that most people leave their grow lights on for around 16 hours per day on a 100W setup that produces about 25 tomatoes a month for example, which puts you at about 2.5kg which costs locally here about $5. Now just the lights alone for 16 hours a day for a month would be more than $7 on a 15c per kwh price.<p>The economics aren&#x27;t bad, you can make it cost about the same as in the store, a little less or a little more, the economics just aren&#x27;t great and given there&#x27;s a whole bunch of time and effort, you&#x27;d only do this for fun, not to save money. The exception is when growing a crop that isn&#x27;t $2 per kg but $10 per gram which is pot, so it&#x27;s no surprise that 9/10 guys probably use this to grow weed. Besides there are much more fun systems around that can look awesome in your house if you just want to grow some veggies mostly on the power of the sun and merely supplemented by grow lights (for a few hours, in certain stages, or in winter), all kinds of hydroponics stuff that&#x27;s a lot of fun as a DIY project to automate fully without hiding it all in a bucket.

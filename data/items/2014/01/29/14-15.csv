7144154,comment,7143438,7143438,6,0,cb_ru,,,"Let&#x27;s have a look at how the Norwegian Nobel Committee works, that is, the people in charge of selecting the winners of the Nobel Peace Prize. Currently, the committee is made up of five members, who have to represent the political parties of the Norwegian Parliament. Here is the list of these members :<p>Mr Jagland (for 4 years)\nMrs Kullmann Five (10 years)\nMrs Ytterhorn (13 years)\nMrs Reiss-Andersen (2 years)\nMr Stalsett (1 year)<p>Jagland has been a member of the Nobel Committee since 2009. The same year, he was elected Secretary General of the Council of Europe. Note that Norway is part of the Council of Europe, but not of the European Union. Jagland is in favor of the EU, although Norwegian people have voted against joining the EU two times.<p>All of the other members are politicians from national parties. According to Wikipedia, Mrs Kullmann Five is also member of the Board of Directors of Statoil, an oil company which is the largest company in Norway. Mrs Reiss-Andersen is a lawyer, and she has written two novels. Mr Stalsett is the Protestant bishop in Oslo.<p>As we can see, the committee is not a group of international law experts, famous scientists or peace activists. The truth is, it seems the five members of the committee do not have the right profile to be responsible for one of the most important international awards in the world.<p>In fact, an additional person helps the committee to make decisions. Geir Lundestad is the director of the Nobel Institute and has been the &quot;secretary&quot; of the Norwegian Nobel Committee since 1990. He was a researcher in charge of international relations at Harvard for three years, and a researcher at the Woodrow Wilson Center, which is the eleventh biggest think tank in the world (according to the Go-To think tank ranking) with famous members like Hillary Clinton and Arne Duncan. Then, in 1990, Geir Lundestad came back to Norway and became the new secretary of the Nobel Committee, and went on for 23 years.<p>The bottom line is that Geir Lundestad is the real decision-maker. This guy calls the shots, and he will of course not choose Edward Snowden as the next Nobel Peace Prize.",1391007511

Haskell is <i>different</i> from most languages, but that doesn&#x27;t make it hopeless or academic <i>a priori</i>. Saying that is itself intellectually lazy, bordering on intellectually dishonest. But it is a good way to save yourself the effort of learning something new!<p>Besides this, Scala has way too much Java in it to really be &quot;algebraically elegant&quot; or even simple! Scala is a compromise. It has the legacy of Java compatibility dragging it down. That&#x27;s one of the main reasons it&#x27;s caught on, but it&#x27;s also the reason it isn&#x27;t actually particularly simple or elegant. It&#x27;s one of the most <i>complex</i> (but not necessarily difficult) languages in common use.<p>It is nowhere near as elegant or simple as OCaml or Haskell as they can afford to be much closer to the λ-calculus. Which is also why they can afford such incredible things like tail call elimination and type inference!<p>Also, while Scala <i>is</i> a multiparadigm language, it <i>is not</i> the best of both worlds. In embracing Java and OO, it throws away many of the advantages of functional programming. In fact, any non-trivial functional programming quickly becomes unbearable. Especially compared to Haskell.<p>Edward Kmett wrote a nice Reddit post[1] about how Scala falls short from a functional standpoint. This is from an entirely practical commercial standpoint based on his experiences at S&P Capital IQ. Here is what he had to say about functional programming in Scala: &quot;If scala was the only language I had to think in, I&#x27;d think functional programming was a bad idea that didn&#x27;t scale, too.&quot; A pretty strong image!<p>Their story is interesting: they took a Java project to Scala. It was an incredible improvement. Then Scala became a pain on its own, so they designed their own functional language for the JVM[2] and moved to that. It was the same sort of incredible improvement. The same thing that happened to Java happened to Scala!<p>Ermine, their new programming language, is basically like the core of Haskell adopted to the JVM along with some interesting new features. One thing that really stood out for me is that they have customizable type error messages: they can have type errors that are domain-specific! That by itself probably has a fair amount of value.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1pjjy5/odersky_the_trouble_with_types_strange_loop_2013/cd3bgcu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1pjjy5/odersky_the_...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/ermine-language/ermine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ermine-language/ermine</a>",1391006755

I don&#x27;t care how many Sherpas you bring, how many ropes are preset for you; trekking to that altitude carrying nothing but your clothes and an ice axe is extremely difficult. And of course there are still expeditions who go to Everest and climb unassisted, without Sherpas, set up their own ropes, etc. Everest, for existential reasons, will always appeal to climbing enthusiasts regardless of its commercialization. But even for the ignorant non-enthusiasts who probably shouldn&#x27;t be there and are less than self-sufficient in getting up, it is a monumental feat.<p>As far as the dangers go, keep in mind that many of the lives claimed by Everest were not &quot;rich idiots.&quot; Rob Hall was an experienced guide known for excellent judgment until he perished in the 1996 disaster. Experience helps a lot but there are always things left to chance, always decision points with ambiguous outcomes that can only be resolved in hindsight.<p>I won&#x27;t weigh in on the morality of leaving stranded climbers on the mountain other than to provide a little bit of context: climbers know going in that rescue above high camp borders on impossibility. Any responsible outfitter sets an expectation that beyond your climbing partners, you are on your own. There are many climbers who will help others at great personal expense (see: 1996 storm where many gave up their summit attempts to do so). But you get one shot at the summit, and most climbers go in with an awareness that unless their rescue seems surprisingly achievable, they will be passed over by other climbers, either heading towards or returning from the summit.

Ha!<p>Usually, a sign of a well run enterprise IT environment is infrastructure builds driven by vendor recommendations, but customized by a deep understanding of the vendor&#x27;s bugs and other strategic factors. On the procurement side, they make deals to keep costs in line. No Fortune 500 is paying $1,300/socket  per host for RHEL -- they&#x27;re wheeling and dealing site licenses that probably end up being similar to the Microsoft model of $X/socket for unlimited VMs.<p>For example, Microsoft hands out lots of useless sizing guidance by assuming that you use physical hardware and JBOD disk. Good Windows admins/build engineers test the actual limits on their environment and size appropriately, and get the vendor to sign off.<p>Enterprises are all about risk mitigation.

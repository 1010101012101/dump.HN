You are using a captcha not for its resistance to automation but as a way to make a user pay (with time) for an action.<p>If you start with the assumption that no one will try to attack your site, then you don't need a captcha at all.  You can give the user any annoying/time-consuming task (e.g. ""click a square ten times""), or you can insert an inconvenient delay in vote submission.  However, people may object less to the inconvenience of something that looks like a captcha, because they are used to them.<p>Needless to say, almost no one uses captchas for this purpose.  Instead, they use captchas to make their sites more resistant to automated abuse -- as you almost certainly will need if your sites become popular.",1299272393

I think it's closer to the truth to say that cavemen either died at birth, or lived a natural lifespan closer to modern man than an average would indicate. So you can't discount a ""caveman"" diet because average life expectancy was (and in some cultures still is) 30 years old.<p>And I think it's a straw man to say that accepting a ""caveman"" or ""hunter gatherer"" diet means we need to accept -every- aspect of ""primitive"" life.<p>EDIT: <a href=""http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/gurven/papers/pdrdraft04182006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/gurven/papers/pdrdraft04182...</a>",1299271995

2289706,comment,2287213,2288522,0,0,krasmark,,,"Let's bear in mind that the author is a guy who went to several different specialists across disciplines. I'm don't think he's talking about a lack of motivation - I think it's more about trying to continue to be active in a healthy way.<p>The author's incentive for going to the gym was so that he could go climb or surf or ski or whatever and be both ""fit"" and injury-free. It's a critical distinction. There was probably a time when all he had to do was go out and make those activities a part of his existence, but I would wager that as he has aged and had different responsibilities come up just making that fitness a side effect wasn't possible. Instead, he probably tried to go ski X times a year, but got hurt the first time, and the subsequent trips never happened. He probably tried to go climbing weekly, but something tweaked and suddenly he was only climbing monthly. When it's harder to go out and run 5 miles like you used to, you're less inclined to go run 5 miles, and might slip to 3. When 3 is eventually harder than before, you might just not run at all.<p>I think the article is speaking more to concerns as you age and you can no longer get away as easily with just participating in the sport. Rob Shaul and his mtnathlete.com and militaryathlete.com sites address those problems quite directly, and unfortunately it involves a lot of painful work that is mostly gym based. He's designing the mtnathlete workouts to help skiiers stay healthy and be ready when the season arrives. He's training military personnel to be more durable and harder to kill. To explain, the site is a few years old, but when he started it it was as Crossfit was just starting to ramp up in popularity. Despite the advertising that it makes you better at everything athletic, Crossfit is usually all about Crossfit - there are Crossfit games now and it is in many ways its own sport now. Rob's site was very specifically geared to mountain athletes who wanted to perform their sport at a high level possible with less injury. It's not a gym program just for the sake of being a gym program.<p>There was a time when I could go out and make my life about doing whatever sport it may be - climbing, running, basketball, etc. - and recover quickly and easily from the activity. Now my body has aged a little, I sit in a chair too much, and suddenly a small nagging injury never goes away, and I'm less motivated to go run several miles or play basketball or climb. By incorporating durability training like the article discusses, I'm more able to avoid those prolonged periods of inactivity and keep motivation up.",1299271536

But the premise we're testing here essentially boils down to ""we should do things like cavemen because it's natural, because it's natural it's what we evolved to do, since it's what we evolve to do it'll be healthier""<p>The other component of that is of course that we're all fat and out of shape today because we eat foods that cavemen never had access to.<p>One measure of health is of course weight, but so is life expectancy. If we follow a life-plan where we're around some normal weight but die at 30 I'm not sure that's a great plan. We evolved to die around 30, most research into aging agrees with this (some say ~40), and that's ""natural"" I suppose, but I think I reject that notion that we should only do things in the modern world that fit what we were required to do a million years ago because it's what we evolved to cope with and eek out 3 or 4 decades of life.<p>Another is infant mortality, we evolved to reproduce pretty fast because we evolved to maintain population with lots of dead infants. We also evolved to produce slightly more males than females since men die faster, which is okay since fewer men can reproduce with more women.<p>We also evolved to be able to bear children in our early teens, to grow beards, hair and nails, and to have bad eyesight in some large percentage of the population. Should we lower the age of consent to 13? Not shave or cut our hair or nails ever and not wear glasses?<p>I'm not sure any of these notions work today, but extending the central argument out:<p>If we should eat like our ancient ancestors did since we evolved to eat like that and therefore it must be healthy, should we not live like our ancient ancestors did since therefore that must be equally valid by the ""it's all natural so it's good"" principle?",1299270744

Frequent trips to D.C., Baltimore, Philly, NYC all my life...the cities are all too new to really see such dramatic growth from the ground without really taking some time to see it. Oh a suburb here and there, a new road, a new high ramp, a new shopping center etc.<p>I think that D.C. in some ways is fairly easy to actually drive through the history of the city and its growth. Starting in D.C. going South or West you find yourself in various ""old towns"" like old town Alexandria that even today have a distinctly old timy feel. A mess of roads, narrow streets, etc. right after that you quickly see urban areas like Arlington give way to what used to be the far off suburbs of D.C. in Alexandria or Fairfax or Vienna or Falls Church. Today they are an almost unbroken semi-suburb of shopping centers and communities of small old houses built in the 60s and 70s. Get out past that area and you find the 80s. Lots of shopping malls, larger newer homes, etc. The area is noticeably nicer, better planned, less crowded, newer stuff. Out past that you find the 90s and so on and so forth.<p>And at some point it sort of reverses itself as you near the next old town area, you start going back again through time. The bigger the original town was, the more noticeable it is (you see this effect more as you approach Leesburg or Manassas than Haymarket.)<p>I actually found this effect even more interesting and pronounced in Europe, with so many cities founded by Romans, surrounded by a medieval era unplanned rats maze of narrow roads punctuated with a few Renaissance buildings (and a few later eras depending) surrounded by beautifully organized and architected 19th and early 20th century buildings and then a rats maze of ugly modern apartment blocks bleeding off into modern suburbia.<p><a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=paris,+france&aq=&sll=38.861098,-77.240753&sspn=0.577443,1.308746&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Paris,+%C3%8Ele-de-France,+France&ll=48.8576,2.351074&spn=0.060988,0.163593&t=h&z=13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&#38...</a><p><a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Barcelona,+Spain&aq=0&sll=48.8576,2.351074&sspn=0.060988,0.163593&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Barcelona,+Province+of+Barcelona,+Catalonia,+Spain&ll=41.385954,2.168255&spn=0.069548,0.163593&t=h&z=13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&#38...</a><p>You can actually see the history from space, the road organization and building layout are tell-tale.

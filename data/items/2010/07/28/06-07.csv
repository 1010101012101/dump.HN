1553784,comment,1553270,1553753,0,0,biotech,,,"There are certain terms (like ""a software"") that are never used by people who's first language is English. IANAL (I am not a linguist), but I'd consider myself a ""descriptivist"" when it comes to defining a language. I think that a living language is defined by its usage by native speakers. Forms that are never used by native speakers can be defined as ""incorrect"". Of course, languages change (especially English), so those forms can and do become incorporated into the language over time. But, as English stands in 2010, ""a software"" is less correct than simply saying ""software"".",1280300350

If you are bad in field A, and an expert in field B, you may be able to comeup with a revolutionary idea for field B, not because you're one lucky son of a bitch, but because your expertise in area A put you in advantageous/unique perspective. We all saw biologist cooperate with engineers (using nature-invented systems in engineering, prostetic arms, etc), politicians cooperate with doctors (cheap medical solutions for poorer countries), and many more awesome examples. I think we're lacking some kind of platform or incentive to interconnect disciplines. Programmers among us see it everyday â€” just go to your local DMV, take a spot in the endless waiting line, and notice how much you wish they'd let you write a decent piece of software or build a simple mechanism to make this hell go away.

I was a subscriber back before and during the Iraq War, and as the war progressed it was clear that their information, as in-depth as it sounds, mostly reveals itself as BS in the long run. One example relavant to your comment was that they were among the worst at pushing obviously and flagrantly false WMD stories even many months into the war. But that's just the start; their seemingly detailed and insightful articles were ultimately wrong about just about every little detail they contained. It became perfectly clear that their sources came from the same ranks as the mainstream media's (the US military and a variety of polically motivated officials), the sources were just more obscure and lower level.

Unmedicated, I get one good day a month;  I often get more done on that day than I do the rest of the month.  Medicated, that day becomes somewhat average.<p>For me, most of the depression issues were caused by the fact that I was very obviously not performing up to potential, and when the stimulants fixed that problem, the depression issues mostly went away.<p>I actually was in a pretty similar situation around your age.

Four years later, I'm a published author, my company is paying my bills, and I'm generally not ashamed to be where I am.   (Now, I'm not on medication anymore...  long story... and I'm once again /much less productive/  so it's not like the problem is solved permanently.

Social Democratia will have to either drop its social programs (converging with Low-Tax Libertonia) or institute some sort of immigration restriction.<p>Or, say Crime Preventistan sets up a really good set of programs, education, etc., such that there would be virtually no crime in their country, and they can have very minimal police and virtually no government surveillance of their citizens. But they live next door to the Wild West Republic, which spends money on neither prevention nor police, and its rampant criminal population enjoys carrying out cross-border burglaries, or maybe even moving next door to set up their outlaw shop in Preventistan. The Crime Preventistan experiment can't really happen unless they're able to close their border with the Wild West Republic and restrict who's allowed to immigrate.<p>In short, I think it'd be difficult to maintain any differences between countries in the face of complete lack of border controls (open immigration, free trade, etc.), because any differences between them would be arbitraged away as soon as someone found a way to exploit them.",1280297318

Your reputation is at stake. How much you are getting paid is irrelevant. Besides, there are plenty of indirect ways to profit from making free software.<p>Also, there are implicit claims in every piece of software that doesn't say otherwise, namely that it is secure, won't trash your data, follows best practices, is not full of bugs, etc.<p>If you want to publish ""as is"" software, that's fine, but it should be made explicity clear to what degree you stand behind the quality of your code.<p>Users have no business complaining because you won't add some feature they came up with or your pre-release version isn't solid. But it is quite reasonable to complain if an open source project does not live up to its own pretenses.",1228715863

Perhaps I should have put ""Exciting New Developments"" in silly caps to emphasize that I was talking about <i>hype</i>. If you want to work in a language that still has significant hype, and <i>enjoys</i> having hype, and doesn't try to make you feel dirty for <i>practicing</i> hype, you need to learn a language other than Perl. Until Perl 6 comes out, at any rate.<p>Your post does little to convince me that I'm wrong about that. :)<p>Personally, I like a little hype in my life. I tend to agree with Bruce Sterling:<p><a href=""http://www.viridiandesign.org/2006/03/viridian-note-00459-emerging.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.viridiandesign.org/2006/03/viridian-note-00459-em...</a><p><i>Hype is a system-call on your attention. If hype is clearly aimed straight at your wallet, you are right to worry. But hype is only bad for you if you drink it unthinkingly, by the barrel and case. If you soberly track its development, hype is very revealing. Even mistaken and obscurantist hype shows that people are stupid and trying to hide something, which are always good things to know.</i><p><i>In politics, the opposite of hype is political reality. Political hype is BS, it's a campaign speech, it's meant to deceive the listener. But in technology, the opposite of hype is not the truth. The opposite of hype in technology is argot. It's techno-jargon. Argot is not reality, jargon is not the truth. Argot is a super-specialized geek cult language that has no traction in the real world. Argot is the deliberately hermetic language of a small knowledge clique.</i><p>I do not doubt that Perl programmers are very smart, and that they are constantly pushing the state of the art. I also do not doubt that Perl code runs the world while other languages are frivolously reinventing new and sillier forms of the wheel. (How can I? I wrote a bunch of Perl code that is currently helping to run a factory. There is every danger that this Perl code, though not a sterling example of its genre, will outlive me. I have a healthy respect for Perl's usefulness.)<p>But I'm not convinced the language is reaching a lot of new blood. And that's an important task -- perhaps the <i>most</i> important task. They say that every trick in software was invented by a Lisp programmer before I was born, and they may be right. But, to the extent that this is true, that means that there is relatively little to gain right now by making languages ""more powerful"". The real win is to make powerful languages more clear and ubiquitous, and to teach them to more people. And reaching people requires clarity, pedagogy... and hype. You need to make a system call on their attention.",1228715443

Given any web pages, it will extract the contents while throwing away the ads, navigation bar, header, footers, etc.<p>Here is one way to package this algorithm into a useful website.  User will add url links via the website or by importing from a specified del.icio.us tags. The site will extract the contents from these links as a rss feed. User could subscribe to this feed in their mobile news reader.  We're thinking of making this a subscription-based service at $3.99/mo.  The target audiences will be the ones who will download mobile feed readers.<p>Benefits:
1. user could read 'pure content' from their phones, no ads, just the content. 
2. the contents, with all related images, could be pre-downloaded into the feed reader. so whenever you got a minute or two, you could just pull out your phone and read.<p>Questions:
1. What do you think of this idea?  Good? Bad? Dumb?
2. Is the $3.99/mo priced right?<p>Thanks a lot,

389524,comment,386493,386493,0,0,JayGodse21,,,"This is a good question.<p>I think that VC in its current form will be a casualty of the recession. In its current form, the VC grabs a chunk of cash as a management fee, and another chunk of cash to put ""adult supervision"" of seasoned executives on the management team. Also, VCs are not able to manage the kinds of small investments that startups need because VC partners have limited time. Because their of their high overheads in the form of management fees, ""adult supervision"" the small investments simply will no longer pay them what they need to profit. Therefore, from that perspective, I think that VCs are going to be forced out of the web startup sector.<p>In addition, they will also get booted out of sectors that use successful web startups to bootstrap other kinds of businesses. Let's face it...just as you can use a consulting business to bootstrap a company, you can also use a successful web startup to do the same.<p>I think that a new trend that will emerge is that large enterprises will start buying up web startups to take over the product for use in their internal operations. Think of it...suppose you are a large enterprise who wants to build some fancy web based software to improve some business process. You have a choice between funding an internal group that may take 12 months using ""Cadillac"" components and cost $600k , or you could just troll the 'net and look for a startup that does something similar and buy them up for $300k, which gives them rights to working software and the talents of the developers (using appropriate golden handcuffs). It also gives YC a the proverbial 10x return on its proverbial $15k investment and each of the proverbial 3 founders a $50k equity bonus. This will diminish the influence of VCs because web startups that have taken in even a million in VC funding will not be able to sell out for less than $10 million...a price too high for enterprises to spend on business process improvement.",1228714197

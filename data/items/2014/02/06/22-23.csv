All it takes is for 1 small country (like Singapore) to embrace bitcoin for it to be worth $1,000,000 a coin. The first country that wises up to bitcoin, starts investing in mining and other bitcoin infrastructure in a big way, and legitimises its mainstream usage as a currency, is going to reap tremendous benefits.

If a book is $20 at a seller with stellar feedback from a large number of customers, and $18 at a seller with very little feedback, I&#x27;ll probably buy from the $20 seller.<p>What happened in the case with the two bots on Amazon was that one bot was pricing for a seller with a stellar reputation based on a lot of feedback. It was finding the low price from sellers whose reputations were not as good, and setting the price enough above that to make a profit reselling from the low seller if someone ordered.<p>The low seller&#x27;s bot was using a strategy of undercutting the lowest other seller.<p>The amount the first bot was adding was more than the amount the second bot was undercutting by, so the net result was the price zoomed up.",1391727461

I set up our repo and promptly forgot about, as I was traveling out to SF for Startup School 2012.<p>While waiting in the lobby of YC for the pre-event dinner, I got an email from Circle (actually, from Paul) that our repo was ready and all tests were passing.

Each day there are tens of new &quot;very small&quot; games released on mobile, so you are still competing with a fraction of % chance to win.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean making many games is a bad idea. Rovio had made several dozen games before Angry Birds went viral. Halfbrick spent years barely scraping by before Fruit Ninja became a huge hit. Zynga of course had published many games before Farmville. NimbleBit were doing a game every two months for 3 years before Tiny Tower.<p>The difference is that each (or at least most) of the games in these companies was developed with the belief that is was a game worthy of being made. To paraphrase Picasso, luck must catch you hard at work.<p>As for the untapped market, I don&#x27;t know. There&#x27;s lots of excellent non-predatory games of any type imaginable in the $1-$4 bracket for anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind paying for quality.

They&#x27;d also be the ones most likely to pipe the mesh into the existing infrastructure.  Who else besides the likes of Google / Netflix / Facebook would front heavier duty APs city-wide.  Every ounce of traffic would have to be encrypted though.  The main barriers for mesh networking when I look at it are:<p>First and foremost: Antennas and hardware in general.  It&#x27;s one thing to maintain a multi-channel 500mbps connection within 10-20 feet, let alone doing it with multiple devices simultaneously connected to other multiple devices.  Even if you scale the speed down, the consumer grade hardware out there isn&#x27;t targeting this use case.<p>Second: Protocols.  If we had the hardware, the whole mesh has to be trustless while being affected as little as possible by connectivity and pathing overhead.  Plus backwards compatible with existing infrastructure (which is less hard I guess).<p>Third: Gatekeepers.  If you get them on board, creating the mesh as a natural extension of the internet becomes easy.  Since they invariably won&#x27;t be on board, it&#x27;ll be that much harder.",1391725888

I&#x27;ve been saying for years that there is a killer opportunity for Microsoft in the enterprise: develop a single platform for serving applications that serves a tablet view to tablet users, a desktop view to desktop users and a mobile view to mobile users. Basically, enable the hell out of BYOD because the PC is disappearing. They can make the money they lose in Windows licenses back on the server side: if the PC industry is pushing all the workload and complexity to the server, the costs should go there as well.<p>Basically, it should be RDP/VDI but the entire interface adjusts to the device you&#x27;re using it on. They have a great touch interface in the Metro (or whatever they&#x27;re calling it) -- their mistake was forcing users with a mouse and keyboard to use it as well. I suspect that a lot of Microsoft&#x27;s tablet shenanigans have been because they were trying to make the Surface happen.

My only criticism is of the live editing feature.<p>That&#x27;s what drew me to the editor in the first place, but it seems to be very buggy. It stops updating the preview sporadically — and predictably, each time I open the JS Console.<p>As a front-end dev, I can&#x27;t really count on a preview that doesn&#x27;t function with developer tools open.<p>Having said all that, I understand that Brackets is relatively new, and it takes time to iron things out. I will keep up-to-date with their progress and consider using the service in the future.",1391724003

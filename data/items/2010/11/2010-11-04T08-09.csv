1868206,comment,1866952,1867777,0,0,ewjordan,,,"Here's the problem: while I would tend to agree with you if your claim was that global warming is not as clear cut an issue as the mainstream makes it out to be, that's not how your post comes across.<p>The real problem with the way you're arguing is that most of the meta-critiques that you've offered about the way mainstream climate change scientists act read almost exactly the same as the anti-evolution arguments that biologists have been assaulted with for decades. ""Consensus is not how science is done?"" Check.  ""The evidence goes against prevailing opinion?"" Check.  ""Proponents won't argue the science and just parrot talking points?"" Check.  ""They just shout people down as 'anti-science' when they disagree?"" Check.<p>And all these claims may be true, hell, they probably are.  The problem is, <i>that's how scientists act when they're right</i>, just as much as when they're wrong.<p>This doesn't bear on your claim at all, of course, and I have no intention of getting into a specific global warming dispute (I don't have the expertise or the interest, and frankly, I doubt there are many people here that do); but those arguments mean absolutely nothing, because they are <i>always</i> offered whenever people disagree with the prevailing consensus in a field, whether it's correct or not.<p>I've only met a couple climate scientists, but my impression was most definitely not that they were ideologically driven morons that simply want to push their preconceived notions on the world.  I've always gotten the sense that they really felt that the data supported their claims.  Now, that doesn't make them right, but be careful about assuming that they're just perpetrating a fraud for some reason.  One of the most common mistakes people make when arguing issues like this is to assume that the other side actually knows (or secretly suspects) that it's wrong, and it's playing dirty to trick everyone else.  This is rarely the case, if someone is wrong it's typically more likely that the evidence they've seen strongly suggests their hypothesis, which ends up blinding them to later evidence that might weaken it.",1288860993

It's a separate product for inclusion in other proprietary products.  MySQL has always been a dual-license product, and this is similar to previous offerings by MySQL AB and Sun.<p>The ""N/A"" price probably just means ""contact us so our sales team can squeeze you for all you're worth"" -- which is how enterprise software deals typically work.",1288858984

When it's known, people do a great deal to minimize their time spent in line.  They go to the store at off hours; they switch lines once they're standing in them.  I know my local Taco Bell gets a lot more business from me because of their speedy response time, vs. the teriyaki place next door that I like more, but takes forever.  And my college's bookstore has had a great deal of success with putting live camera feeds of their lines (or lack thereof) on their website.<p>But with grocery stores, I couldn't really tell you which of the two grocery stores in my area would have a longer line.  They're <i>about</i> the same, and that's close enough.<p>So you'd need a pretty big delta for line length to become a differentiating factor between stores.  The current system of a cashier scanning items individually probably won't see drastic efficiency improvements without drastic changes, so...drastic changes are needed.<p>After a certain point, changes in ""line length"" become ""presence or absence of a line at all.""  As jonnathanson says below, electronic scan-as-you-buy is probably the future there(Smith's, in answer to my cousin's email inquiry, mentioned they were testing a portable bar code scanner).  I'm under the impression that grocery stores have pretty cruddy margins, so maybe I shouldn't read that much into ""in testing.""  If anyone out there is dying for a startup idea, I think this one is worth a look.  (Before you say it, I'm working on another project, and my cousin left for grad school.)<p>Since few things are more self-satisfying than sailing out of a store without waiting in line, maybe Whole Foods will be the first? ;)",1288858742

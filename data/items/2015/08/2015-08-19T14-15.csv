10085931,comment,10083475,10083475,0,0,AdamN,,,"I guess I thought this was common knowledge.  I&#x27;ve stayed away from working at Amazon for a while now based on stories from other tech people I know.  It&#x27;s not a top-tier place to work outside of AWS and the opportunities aren&#x27;t really that great either.  Maybe the pay is good?  I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s not competitive even.<p>I know how it is though - people want the stamp of a top company on their resume.  They also want to succeed.<p>I blame the husband just a tiny bit - for not saying &#x27;no&#x27; earlier.  Ironically, he might not have been fired if he put a line in the sand earlier.  He probably did underperform because he wasn&#x27;t managing the manager&#x27;s expectations properly.<p>Of course, he might have gotten fired anyway - nobody will ever know.<p>Work is tough - and unfortunately companies like Amazon aren&#x27;t &quot;buffering the core&quot; very well.  These are engineers who might not be good at managing expectations or managing or leadership even - but why stress them out if they&#x27;re otherwise super-useful to the company?  Employees who can&#x27;t handle this stress but are otherwise valuable should be cradled and they&#x27;ll perform better for longer - pretty simple really.",1439996346

(Not to mention a UK family, job, house, pension fund and many other ties.)<p>I&#x27;ve seen enough journalists harassed on US entry to be extremely careful about doing everything correctly, and I&#x27;m always extremely polite. This usually works, but not every time. I appreciate that ultimately I have no rights and no way to defend myself.<p><i>Welcome to America</i> records the experience of a journalist who neglected to get an I-visa. She was fingerprinted, body-searched, jailed and then deported. But, she says,<p>&quot;I had travelled to the US on many occasions, both for work and pleasure, that I had, in fact, lived there as a permanent resident and that my husband was a US citizen, as was my New York-born daughter, all fell on deaf ears.&quot;<p>She notes that &quot;As documented by Reporters Without Borders and by the American Society of Newspaper Editors (Asne) in letters to Colin Powell and Tom Ridge, cases such as mine are part of a systemic policy of harassing media representatives from 27 friendly countries whose citizens - not journalists! - can travel to the US without a visa, for 90 days.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/05/usa.weekend7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/05/usa.weekend7</a>",1439996320

Talking with friends and coworkers, I kept hearing about how they use to read all the time, but stopped.  I definitely wasn&#x27;t reading as much as I wanted either.  Making time to read is hard after work, other commitments, and trying to have a social life.<p>To make things easier, I made Monthly Book Club.  You sign up for either a monthly subscription or a &quot;business course&quot; and get delivered a book that fits your genre or topic each month.  Spacing a book out over a month is pretty easy and knowing another book is coming next month motivates you to read the current one.<p>That&#x27;s the idea anyway.  The cool thing about subscription &quot;boxes&quot; is that they have low overhead.  If you consider this my MVP, it probably cost me $200-300 and most of that was the LLC registration.  My plan is to market to business schools and businesses because books are still one of the best ways to learn soft skills.<p>Any feedback would be appreciated!",1439996250

In isolation, they were pretty cool, but in terms of composability, maintainability, and compatibility, they were a nightmare. Life pre-SASS sucked, and even pre-BEM it was pretty horrible once an app started to sprawl. There&#x27;s still a place for all of the great little CSS techniques, but just factored into mixins, where the implementation can be encapsulated, and represented by something much smaller that represents the effect.<p>You&#x27;re right that there&#x27;s a bewildering number of technologies and approaches out there, but I think we&#x27;re actually converging towards something sane. Certain waypoints are basically being agreed upon. Sure, we have SASS/LESS/Stylus/PostCSS, but ultimately people use them 95% identically, and that commonality was a huge win. BEM has similarly been a huge win, wand widely adopted. Reading the OP, I was nodding my head along as I read, and I think they&#x27;re on to something really good.

The company can see the opportunity to squeeze 30K from a client, but when that license expires, the chance the customer goes a different direction is higher.  Instead if you accept that it was a mistake, use it as an opportunity to expand the license, not only have you increased the revenue from that company, but you&#x27;ve also shown you are easy to work with, forgiving and therefore the customer is more likely to renew.<p>I&#x27;ll provide a very anecdotal story that happened to me.  I once worked in a bar/kitchen and was paid under the table in cash each week.  The owner would give me the cash in an envelope with the number of hours I worked.  On a few occasions he would overpay me by $20 or so.  Some may this as an opportunity to get an extra $20.

They talk. They make suggestions - ranging from everything from common sense things that may have more weight because they are coming from a medical professional, to recommending aggressive routines and techniques (meditation, diet change, medication, group therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, changes in routine, sleep patterns) that require the active participation of the patient and, over time, are shown, in double blind, peer reviewed studies, to have positive impacts. You aren&#x27;t just paying some asshole to listen to you.<p>* A therapist, with years of training, is often able to easily identify stressors of which you are unaware, and separate out stressors that are present in the environment (your shitty, shitty job) vs. the result of old emotional trauma (e.g. horrible parenting) vs. personality disorders (borderline personality, OCD) vs. mental illness (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder) and can figure out a plan tailored to your needs. This may involve a combination of different types of therapy (there are many, and many types of &#x27;talk&#x27; therapy actually are vastly different when viewed from the inside), in some instances, medication, and in most instances, figuring out how to make changes in your life to reduce stressors.<p>A therapist isn&#x27;t just a black hole into whom you throw your problems. A therapist is a medical expert who has deep knowledge of personality and mental disorders, knowledge of pro-active methods of combating both, and acts as a medically informed, objective &#x27;life coach.&#x27;<p>I mean, damn, what does a physical trainer do if not just talk to you? Why not go to a priest or faith healer to get your calves real swole? What does a financial advisor do if not just talk to you? Why not go to a priest or a faith healer to manage your 401k?<p>The ignorance displayed at this:<p>> If so, can they explain how talking to a psychologist cures a medical condition?<p>Is just sort of flabbergasting. Not all the reasons you go to a therapist are for medical conditions; many therapists are MDs; therapy doesn&#x27;t just consist of talking to someone; like any other field, it has tons of study and many experts, people who know better than you do, and quite often it helps to talk to an expert.<p>If that comes off as harsh - I apologize - especially if you are someone who is on the fence about therapy. I sincerely suspect, however, you are not, and, instead, just assaulting the idea that therapy is even remotely a worthwhile pursuit. It is.",1439995408

I&#x27;m permanently settled in Japan now, and often wonder about if I will ever become a citizen.  There are very few benefits to being a citizen in ordinary life, and many drawbacks.<p>First Japan requires you to renounce your old citizenship.  Not a huge problem, but it means that I would need to get a tourist visa to visit my family in Canada.  Since I currently have a visa for Japan, it is easy for me to leave Japan, enter Canada and return to Japan.  If I were a Japanese citizen it becomes more difficult in practice.<p>Also, as a Canadian citizen I am legally allowed to work in Canada if, by some stroke of hard luck, I was unable to find work in Japan.  Also, due to the free trade agreement with the US, I can work in the US.  Also, due to the fact that I am a commonwealth citizen with British ancestry, I can work in the UK (which I did recently).  All of that disappears if I become a Japanese citizen.<p>And what do I get in return?  I can vote in local elections.  And I can&#x27;t be deported.<p>Although it is naive, it&#x27;s easy to think &quot;I have a visa and up to this point, I have had no problems at all with the Japanese government.  My spouse is Japanese, so surely they won&#x27;t kick me out, right?&quot;  It&#x27;s easy to think that there are lots of drawbacks with no benefits.<p>But if I am really honest with myself, what would I do if I got kicked out of Japan?  I would be seriously unhappy.  This is my home and I never want to leave.  If I feel that way, I should try to get citizenship, no matter what inconvenience that entails.<p>Of course, I think I&#x27;ve got another 9 years before I can apply, so I have a long time to think about it (I lived here before, but when I went to the UK, I had to restart the timer :-P )",1439995274

Websites like csszengarden.com showed us the promise of style sheets, and the galleries of &quot;CSS sites&quot; during the mid to late 2000s demonstrated what amazing works could be taken from photoshop (and Fireworks!) and made into beautiful, pixel-perfect layouts. I always felt proud to make a website with only semantic HTML and CSS, and it always worked well. Even with all the browser issues (namely those of IE6), it was easy to write cross-browser compatible code that was clean and beautiful. The (C)ascading part of CSS was still considered a feature, and deeply understanding its implications was an acceptable challenge.<p>Then came The Age of Great Coupling & Frameworks (made that name up) wherein CSS began to be regarded as a hindrance. Frameworks like Bootstrap became the status quo, because it meant you could go from 0% to 60% in half the time. But, no longer did anybody decide to go to 100%. The coupling I speak of isn&#x27;t just a coupling of backend to frontend technologies, but a coupling of backend to frontend workflows. In a subconscious effort to become more efficient, we, as software engineers, began to find ways to incorporate automatic solutions for every problem (e.g., LESS). This is partly due to the very slow nature of completing and proliferating new CSS specifications, but in the long run all of these tools and frameworks have grown the barriers of entry, and have bifurcated the community in many ways (e.g., LESS vs SASS, responsive framework vs pure CSS, non-standard with polyfill vs standard, etc.).<p>These differences are not the kinds of differences that cause anger (usually), but they make it hard to hire and train, and they make it hard for frontend engineers to work together easily. At the end of the day we&#x27;re all building CSS and HTML with JavaScript, but if I strike up a conversation with 3 different frontend engineers, each will be as different as if I had chosen to talk to an astronaut, a vet tech, and a professional swimmer. That&#x27;s almost no exaggeration. Diversity of skills and tasks within an occupation is a good thing, but at some extreme it decreases mobility. When I felt like I had learned CSS, well years ago, the thought never crossed my mind that someday choosing a CSS-related tool would be as much a career decision as choosing a primary programming language to focus on.<p>FTR, I don&#x27;t have solutions for the problems I pointed out, nor do I think we should somehow reset and go back to the past, but I feel strongly that we&#x27;ve made things more complicated than they need to be.",1439994483

I&#x27;m glad I have a lower, less prestigious job because it&#x27;s classified as non-exempt. That means if I&#x27;m on call, I&#x27;m paid for it. Which means the company really has to think &quot;is it worth having this guy sit around in case something breaks?&quot;. It also means company policy prohibits me from having a company cell with email access, because I shouldn&#x27;t be working off the clock. This lets me work on many side projects because at 5:00p, I&#x27;m done. If they need me to do more, they pay me more.<p>I won&#x27;t say the system is perfect, but when the company incurs a cost for being legally obligated to pay more for more work, I think the employment social contract becomes more fair.

I&#x27;m sure the more extreme advocates of this prosecution will try to draw parallels to &quot;What if someone put a bomb making guide online&quot;; but this illustrates the point well: When the original feinstein bill to make illegal distributing bomb making information was put into place, it was not long after that corporate interests wanted to move the needle such that financial damages were protected in similar form, in this case from CD cracking.<p>We&#x27;ve now moved one step further, pursuing those helping people find ways to help them do an illegal act (my own opinions aside, it&#x27;s still illegal), and while this can be very readily justified as simply expanding the scope of investigation for involved parties, I have two primary concerns.<p>- One, where do you draw the line?

Getting a passport issued when you are living outside the UK can take months, so I decided to go back to my parents. As the UK is outside the schengen-area I wasn&#x27;t able to travel there without a passport, so had to book an appointment at the British Consulate in Milano. Three days later I turned up and they issued me an &#x27;Emergency Passport&#x27;, this is pretty much the same as a normal passport except smaller as it is for a single trip, and costs £95 [0].<p>When I got back to the UK I booked an appointment, the earliest they had was 4 weeks later (you can&#x27;t get a replacement for a lost or stolen passport under the 1-day service). On the day I travelled up to London (~£50 by train), paid another £103, came home and waited a week for it to be delivered.<p>Earlier this year I got married (outside the UK and my current home country) and needed to get a &quot;Certificate of no impediment&quot; to say I am legally able to get married. On the gov.uk website it says I can do this at the consulate nearest to where I live, but they said I needed to do it at the consulate nearest to where I intended to get married.<p>So off I went there, handed in the form and paid the £65 fee. This then got displayed somewhere for a week so people can oppose it if needed (not that anyone in this country knew me...), and then I went back, paid another £65 and got the certificate. I also needed to get my birth certificate legalised - which can only be done by sending it back to the UK...<p>[0] In the local currency at a rather poor exchange rate.",1439993344

About board game dominance on kickstarter, though: it seems to me that kickstarter funds more card and board games than any other class of things.<p>> Second, a large proportion of the games that get funded are traditional publishers using Kickstarter as an alternate preorder and marketing system, usually with absolutely tiny goals.<p>Those traditional publishers seem to be publishing 2-3x as many games as they were publishing pre-kickstarter, and/or have moved to an entirely kickstarted model, basically becoming kickstarter companies (Queen, Eagle/Gryphon, etc.) It&#x27;s not the preorders that are so important, but the free, instant crowdfunded <i>credit</i>.<p>> A third decent sized chunk are reprints for old games, which while nice to have are hardly a sign of a renaissance.<p>When many of the classics of gaming were only available from 20-year-old German 2000 game print runs for so long, this can seem like the definition of renaissance. Virtually all of the bgg.com top 100 are in print. 5 years ago, a lot of those games (the ones that existed) would have cost a small fortune. With every passing day my collection becomes less valuable, but more people fall in love with the board games I like.<p>> What&#x27;s left tends to not have much impact, or even be any good.<p>Agreed, but within class that are buried amazing designers like Martin Wallace and Phil Eklund, who have used kickstarter to become largely independent of the big publishers.",1439993183

10085494,story,,,2,1,tsenkov,"Ask HN: Would you use a cross-platform launcher?",,"I&#x27;ve built an app called Pagehop (https://pagehopapp.com), which is a launcher app, targeting the web (and currently only for OS X).<p>Pagehop&#x27;s core is cross-platform and I am thinking about pivoting to a new, not-so-distant idea - a cross-platform launcher. :)
I&#x27;ll definitely rebrand, if I go in this direction, since the app will no longer be the &quot;launcher app for the web&quot;.<p>This time the idea is to have default tools such as the ones that Spotlight and Alfred provide on OS X (calculator, clipboard management, browse the FS etc.), combined with Pagehop&#x27;s web plugins (Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Stackoverflow and bunch of other searches) AND a support for Teams with auto-sync of plugins between team members.<p>So if you have a team of 30 people and they use PC&#x27;s & Macs, you can have a team account for the app and everyone on the team can have the same set of productivity tools, specific for the team, available on a globally-assigned key shortcut. And whenever you need to implement a simple new graphic representing some data of your business - you can have a developer build a simple Node.js plugin, upload it in the team account and everyone would automatically get it. Same goes for updating tools. And when a new team member comes along, they only need to install Pagehop and login to get their productivity tool-belt installed.<p>What do you think? Does that seem like a good idea? Would you use it for your team?<p>Thanks in advance for all answers.",1439992900

Hacking isn&#x27;t.  The end.<p>But the middle question is interesting, and I dare say that many people have views such as my own, where morality is not dependent on legality but on morality.  And I would also dare to say that most people do not have an issue exposing people who are using websites to commit very immoral actions.  So the question becomes one of if the action of cheating is immoral enough to cross this threshold.  That question is a really deep moral one and you probably have as much ability to change as most any deeply held moral view.<p>In short, most everyone agrees the right to privacy has limits based on extremely immoral actions.  The difference is only in what counts as immoral enough, which is far less a distinction than &#x27;right to privacy means hacking is wrong&#x27;.",1439992877

I have had two passports since my ILR visa was issued (it&#x27;s currently affixed in an old passport). So I do have a current passport, it&#x27;s just that the visa is in an old one.<p>I do qualify for citizenship, and it did cross my mind. But it&#x27;s quite expensive for me. And to add insult to injury, I would still need the BRP (£1000~ citizenship + £660 BRP). For me that&#x27;s not an amount I have readily available.<p>Maybe I took my visa for granted, but I was awarded it when I was a teenager. I called up immigration a few years back, and asked about whether I should get my visa transferred to a newer passport, or whether I should apply for a citizenship, and was told that unless I really wanted to vote then I shouldn&#x27;t worry about it (the only thing denied to residents with an ILR, apparently).<p>It just didn&#x27;t occur to me that one of my responsibilities (?) would be to keep up with current immigration legislation, just in case the rights I was initially awarded indefinitely would suddenly be changed in a way which is disruptive to my life. It kind of scares me to think that things like this can be changed on a whim. I don&#x27;t really know what to think.",1439992802

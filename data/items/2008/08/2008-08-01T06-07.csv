Jim needs to work out a reasonable negotiating position (such as getting paid for the hours actually expended in exchange for handing over the work done to date) and not worry about things like consequential income losses, which are very difficult to recover at law.<p>If after both parties have used their best efforts to resolve the disputes and there is still no agreement; then consult the lawyers.",1217573961

I think your product is interesting, but your execution is very poor.<p>There are a lot of things you are bad at. Your copy, design and interface are inadequate. Most importantly, your name does not work. For a consumer product, these failings are deadly.<p>You need to find someone who can do those things for you.<p>You also need to stop using Lisp. I could build your product in a weekend using Python or Ruby. It would take me four years to do it in C. It took you four years to do it in Lisp...",1217573745

But the current owner of the spectrum - the FCC - is an illegitimate one:<p>Read Declan McCullagh's June 7, 2004 column for news.com, ""Why the FCC should die"" (<a href=""http://news.cnet.com/Why-the-FCC-should-die/2010-1028_3-5226979.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/Why-the-FCC-should-die/2010-1028_3-5226...</a>)<p>If you really want more competition in the telecommunications industry, you'll find the FCC standing in the way. They don't serve any technical purpose anymore (except to keep technology down and to allow old radios to work), but they sure as hell get in the way of new companies that might compete with existing ones.<p>Keep in mind that without companies to build the radios and service the networks and so on that make the spectrum valuable, who would be able to use it, other than a few thousand engineers? What good would all the oil in Saudi Arabia do you if <i>someone</i> didn't know how to get it out of the ground, how to refine it, and how to build cars to use it? Remember that when you declare something like spectrum public, you inherently lose the ability to maintain everyone's rights.<p>""There is no limit to the amount of greed.""<p>Not true - at and above a certain price for any good or service, customers won't buy. This is econ 101 stuff.<p>""limited spectrum"" - you would do well to take a signals processing class. Spectrum is only limited in the physical sense (the electromagnetic spectrum is what it is), but beyond that, there are many ways to transfer more information across the same spectrum through additional processing. Surely you know about things like DSL and 802.11, neither of which were possible before cheap processors became commonplace.",1217573416

263817,comment,263599,263599,0,0,Tichy,,,"Chatting with a salesperson recently, I thought it was interesting how he described there being different kinds of sales people. There are some getting by on people skills and knowing everybody and their brother, and get the foot in the door that way. Others are extremely technical and make an impression that way. And so on (sadly, I forgot most details). So I could imagine that there might have been a customer who would have been the perfect match for the clueless first hire. Like if at the other end there was also an idiot hire, maybe he might even have fallen for the ""it has A, but C is totally super, and B is awesome"" stuff.<p>I don't know how those companies handle the matching of sales people to customers, though.",1217572557

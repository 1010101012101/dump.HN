I only played with it for 5 or 10 minutes, but I found this:<p>Say you remove the id tag of #signup-form and change it to some arbitrary classname. The styling immediately goes away on the element! Somewhere there&#x27;s a hard-coded style on the ID selector for the purposes of a pretty demo. This doesn&#x27;t sit well with me.. You can see this is true when you click on the &quot;Edit Project CSS&quot; from the top menu item. I should&#x27;ve been able to change that ID to a class or combination of classes and not affect the styling on the fly.<p>Likewise, I&#x27;m a bit concerned what would happen by adding several classes. It doesn&#x27;t appear as though they&#x27;re each uniquely and independently tied to their own styles via the right adjusted area. If you want to do anything non-trivial, I believe you&#x27;re stuck with manually entering the CSS in the &quot;Edit Project CSS&quot; pane on your own, which is worse than using your own IDE with automated updates in the browser via LESS, SCSS, SASS, HAML, Stylus, etc.<p>All I&#x27;m trying to say is better handling of classes would be much appreciated for those of us who prefer to try and widgetize and create reusable components.

7029927,comment,7029454,7029606,9,0,JackMorgan,,,"My perception is most developers who choose to use PHP these days for new development efforts either do so because it&#x27;s their strongest language and do not want to reinvest the time to retool, or because of political reasons orthogonal to PHP&#x27;s technical chops. Thankfully, it is still actively developed, so those who make that choice are able to take advantage of such new features.<p>I totally understand the choice to work in shops that have legacy php code: they have money and often times don&#x27;t want to change off php. Handily enough, most of us like working for money.<p>What caused me to retool away from php was the fear that not enough new systems were being built in it, leaving a diminishing pool of jobs for a constant pool of developers not wanting to retool. I figured I&#x27;d give up my space to someone else, and seek my fortunes on other stacks. I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong with deciding X language will be the one you ride into the sunset on (some COBOL programmers I know make crazy money due to the economics of the ratio of jobs/developers). I just personally considered the risk of a job shortage to outweigh the rush of a talent shortage. (And I am so practiced at retooling, I could probably be ready to interview for a PHP job in a few weeks if I had to).<p>I think of choice of stacks from the agile way, &quot;make it fast to change, and you&#x27;ll be ready to snatch up arbitrage opportunities when they arise.&quot; Rather than the waterfall way, &quot;pick the right tech that will last your career at the point of maximum ignorance&quot;.<p>I think most people mock PHP just because it&#x27;s fashionable to do so, it&#x27;s the &quot;easy joke&quot; that vb6 used to be.

And in some cases (particularly child custody, though also other divorce proceedings, as well as immigration situations due to provisions of VAWA), ROs can be grossly misused to attempt to gain benefits not otherwise available.<p>Typically a TRO should have a hearing within a few weeks, however this isn&#x27;t always the case (particularly in more complicated situations), so &quot;temporary&quot; may be an extended period of time.<p>Orders are rarely granted reciprocally, that is, as mutual stay-away orders, though these are granted in some cases.  A unilateral order turns what are otherwise lawful actions into criminal ones (usually misdemeanors, but not always).  The requesting party may use the order to trap the restrained party, particularly as forms of indirect contact (as described in this story) may be construed as violations of the order.",1389267542

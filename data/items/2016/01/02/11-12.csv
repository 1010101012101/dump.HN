And for that particular function, it actually made sense. It involved a lot of local state, and breaking it up would have involved passing lots of parameters to the new, shorter functions. (The average function in that code base was around 50-60 lines, I guess.)<p>Using a fixed number, like &quot;10 lines&quot; seems arbitrary to me. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes it does not. It also ignores other factors, such as comments. Or readability. Sometimes, I 100+-line function can be marvelously clear, other times,  a 5-liner can be so dense it makes my eyes bleed.<p>I have grown wary of &quot;Always do this&quot;/&quot;Never do that&quot;-advice.<p>&quot;Try to keep your functions short. If they grow long, look if it makes sense to break them up into multiple shorter functions&quot; is sound advice. But to do so without questioning or thinking is problematic.",1451735857

Code I&#x27;ve written have often needed so many variables to do its job that it is very hard to split out small functions. But when you can use closures and higher order function easily, I find it easier to keep the size of functions down.<p>But I prefer Linux take on function size:<p>> The maximum length of a function is inversely proportional to the\ncomplexity and indentation level of that function.  So, if you have a\nconceptually simple function that is just one long (but simple)\ncase-statement, where you have to do lots of small things for a lot of\ndifferent cases, it&#x27;s OK to have a longer function.",1451735837

10825903,comment,10823811,10825824,0,0,mbrock,,,"There&#x27;s some tangentially relevant ideas in a book called &quot;The Spell of the Sensuous,&quot; and also in various works by McLuhan. I think the basic idea is attributed to Eric Havelock. This essay seems to be relevant though I just started skimming it:<p><a href=""http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/1i/6_havelock.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/1i/6_haveloc...</a><p>But basically the idea is that alphabetic literacy creates a whole new style of abstraction and detachment. Before the alphabet there were pictorial glyphs which are still not very abstract, but after the alphabetic revolution in Greece, Havelock traces a new style of philosophy and thinking in general, starting around the time of Plato.<p>Maybe you could compare it to something like the development of algebraic geometry, which allows you to say all kinds of new things in an abstract way, because you move to a level of abstraction that&#x27;s not limited to what you can represent diagrammatically.<p>Oh, it&#x27;s called the &quot;alphabet effect&quot;: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_effect</a><p>It&#x27;s at least something to consider when thinking about an alternate history where we didn&#x27;t use written words. We would probably still have &quot;external memory,&quot; but maybe in a more symbolic/pictorial/diagrammatic/geometric way. Perhaps we would even have symbolic algebra and math, taught by oral instruction... It is pretty hard to imagine!<p>Abram who wrote &quot;The Spell of the Sensuous&quot; has a different argument than Plato. He also critiques writing and the alphabet, not because it ruins memory but because it allows us to retreat from our sensuous embedding in nature, which ultimately helps create a modern world in which we mostly live in a kind of isolation where we are always surrounded by things of human making.<p>> <i>Today we participate almost exclusively with other humans and with our own human-made technologies. It is a precarious situation, given our age-old reciprocity with the many-voiced landscape. We still need that which is other than ourselves and our own creations. The simple premise of this book is that we are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human.</i><p>To try to steer back towards the original conversation... I&#x27;m thinking of things like alarm clocks, which are also technological assistants for doing stuff that we used to do ourselves. They also help maintain a kind of abstraction from our surroundings and &quot;natural&quot; premises: they make us independent of sunrise, circadian rhythms, and so on. And maybe they erode a capacity for waking up at the appropriate time without help. Personally I do avoid using them unless I risk missing a flight or something. If I need to wake up early, I prefer to go to bed early enough to give me a reasonable margin. If I tended to oversleep by hours, I&#x27;d consider that a symptom of sleep deprivation or something.",1451734895

Obviously &#x27;god functions&#x27; and &#x27;god classes&#x27; are bad, but splitting up tightly coupled, related logic into piles of <10 line functions seems ludicrous. Not only does it hurt readability (and debugging) like you mentioned, but it also promotes false sharing of functionality. By splitting things up into very small functions many things may start to appear reusable. The moment it turns out one or two instances of the code that calls all these small functions need to have subtly different behavior you&#x27;ll be hunting down each and every piece of code that calls the function, to be sure that changing it won&#x27;t break completely unrelated parts of the code.",1451734476

It is pretty long, sixteen lines, multiple parts separated by empty lines.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call 16 lines &quot;long&quot;.<p>It contains empty lines for easier reading. Well done, not actually a problem.<p>But it lacks any comments on why the assertions have to be made.<p>> 2. It does several things. It gets an item by name, validates parameters, and it implements the logic of vending an item.<p>These are the things that naturally belong together. Separating validation from logic is not a very good idea. The logic requires the specific assertions in the validation part. They belong together.<p>> 3. It has several abstraction levels.

I didn&#x27;t think there was any intent to do harm to the car.<p>Let me tell you about a personal experience which may help illustrate the problem, and help you be safer when driving your car around trucks. Years ago I was driving a &#x27;cabover&#x27; tractor-trailer (the kind with no hood, it&#x27;s straight down from the front windows to the bunper). I had only five months experience but I was doing pretty good so far. I came up behind a car on a four-lane highway that was going slow, so I started to pass. The car was black and the sun was low and opposite, so as I began to pass and check my mirrors, I made a mental note that the black car riding on blacktop in the shade was harder to see than the other cars further back. No problem, I accelerated more and the car dropped back near my trailer tires. My exit was a couple miles ahead so I wanted to get back over into the slow lane. I looked in the mirrors and the car was gone. I took a long, hard look in the mirrors again and slowed down, in case the car had sped up again and was in my blind spot next to the truck. Nothing. A pickup truck in the slow lane flashed his lights, which is a courtesy signal meaning &#x27;come on back over&#x27; that a lot of truckers and work trucks do. I started to change lanes back to the slow lane, nice and slowly, 3-4 seconds of turn signal in advance, and heard tires starting to skid. I held position and scanned all my mirrors again, trying to find where the noise was coming from. I slowed down more. No clue, just a loud skidding noise of tires dragging on pavement. It sounded like a long skid and I was waiting for the impact sound. I thought I&#x27;d better get over in the slow lane because someone was in the middle of a huge skid and was going to crash. I completed the lane change and slowed down more, and was horrified to see the black car flop around sideways in front of me, stuck to my bumper. A quick panic stop and I was relieved to see the man inside was fine. The side of his car was all chewed up from the tire lug bolts spinning against his door but he was calm and okay. When the police came he told them he was trying to stay in the shade next to me because he didn&#x27;t like the low sun in his eyes, and he apologized for &#x27;causing the accident&#x27;. It was totally my fault and the police cited me, but they gave me a really minor ticket for some obscure law because of the man&#x27;s foolish decision. It was 100% my fault but he could have done more to help me avoid him, that&#x27;s what I was making a genuine effort to do. His speeding up and slowing down to match my speed was dangerous, and you should never do this around trucks. They really can&#x27;t see you well and there are a lot of other cars around they are trying to keep track of. Hope that helps you avoid an accident in your car some day.",1451732998

A PCT application never issues to patent and you have no protection in any country until you have an issued patent. The advantage of PCT filing is the amount of work to perfect filing rights is minimal, and filing costs greatly reduced as opposed to direct filing in separate countries.<p>Once PCT application filed, one can then file the PCT application at the national phase in the countries which protection is desired. If a positive examination result is received in the PCT application, the patent examiners in the countries entered nationally are more likely to issue patent.",1451732892

10825839,comment,10821391,10824883,0,0,qcoh,,,"Symbolic differentiation is what you learned in school and do by hand. Automatic differentiation is, as far as I understand it, you take your nice function, develop it into a Taylor series around x:<p><pre><code>    f(x + h) = f(x) + f&#x27;(x) h + f&#x27;&#x27;(x) h^2 / 2 + ...\n</code></pre>\nSuppose that f is a really, really nice function (defined and holomorphic in a large enough domain in the complex numbers and a Taylor expansion with real coefficients). The curious thing happens when you think of h as just an indeterminate and you evaluate it, for instance, at i s, where i =sqrt(-1) and s is a tiny number. Then<p><pre><code>    f(x + is) = f(x) + f&#x27;(x) is + f&#x27;&#x27;(x) (-s^2)/2 + ...\n</code></pre>\nJust looking at the imaginary part gives you:<p><pre><code>    Im(f(x+is))/s = f&#x27;(x) + O(s^2).\n</code></pre>\nThis means you can compute the derivative with an O(s^2) error just by evaluating at a complex number. The only thing needed was that all operations are implemented not just for real numbers but complex numbers.\nInstead of the R-algebra R[i] = C, why not try to use the R-algebra R[ε] and evaluate at ε, where ε is a symbol with ε^2 = 0? Remember, i is also just a symbol with the property i^2 = -1!!!<p><pre><code>    f(x + ε) = f(x) + f&#x27;(x) ε + f&#x27;&#x27;(x) ε^2/2 + ...\n</code></pre>\nSince 0 = ε^2 = ε^3 = ..., all higher order terms vanish and you get<p><pre><code>    f&#x27;(x) = coefficient of ε in f(x + ε).\n</code></pre>\n(Compare with the complex numbers: Im = &quot;coefficient of i&quot; but this time around, there is no error)<p>Everything that you need is to know how to implement arithmetic operations for numbers in R[ε], e.g.<p><pre><code>    (a+b ε) + (c + d ε) = (a+c) + (b+d) ε\n    (a+b ε) (c + d ε) = ac + (ad + bc) ε + bd ε^2 = ac + (ad + bc) ε\n</code></pre>\nA problem occurs when you try to divide by ε. This is simply undefined in R[ε], which, unlike C is not a field. But not all is lost, suppose you want to divide (a + b ε) by (c + d ε), where c is not 0, then<p><pre><code>    (a+b ε) / (c + d ε) = (a + b ε) (c - d ε) / (c^2 + (-cd + cd) ε) = something with ε in the numerator / c^2,\n</code></pre>\nThat is, division by ε only occurs when you divide by 0 in the first place.<p>To recapitulate: If you have a class DualNumber with overloaded +, -, * , /, ^, you can find the derivative of, say, the fourth-order approximation of e^x at x = 0.5, by computing<p><pre><code>    DualNumber x = DualNumber(0.5, 1);\n    DualNumber approx = 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24;\n    cout << approx.EpsCoeff() << endl;\n</code></pre>\n(Sorry if this not a good explanation but I&#x27;ve spent too much time on it :P)",1451732850

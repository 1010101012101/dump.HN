Depeding on the flow of the site, it is possible that notifying them that data will be lost is an option, but also a hinderance to their navigation.  Based on that, something to explore would be saving the data to be repopulated when/if they return to the form.  Obviously that can be a lot more complex than it sounds, so it would take some planning to make it fluid.",1219355532

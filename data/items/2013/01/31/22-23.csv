Why would you want to keep a firearm near you and your children?<p>The whole 'bad guys have guns' argument is moot, it's a chicken and egg thing. It's the exact same right that allows people to buy guns that gets the guns into society in the first place.<p>Another argument is that cars kill more people each year than guns. Fair point, but cars are meant as means of transportation, but the sole purpose of guns is to kill.<p>I understand the appeal of guns, but shouldn't we keep them locked up at the gun club? Why bring them home?<p>I grew up in The Netherlands, a country with very strict gun control laws and, sadly, one known case of a spree killer. I travelled a lot in the Middle East, where gun ownership is a lot higher. I can honestly say that I feel safer in The Netherlands, without people carrying guns to 'protect' themselves.<p>Banning assault weapons is not a finite solution, but IMHO a baby step in the right direction.",1359673194

It wasn't like a sharp pain, but my back was always very tense and ache-y.<p>What has really helped me is doing handstand-pushups. You do a handstand against a wall, and then do a push up, lowering your head towards the floor. It really engages all the muscles in the shoulders/back. You'll probably start off by just doing a handstand and then go from there slowly. Once you are a bit more confident you can also arch your back away from the wall engaging muscles lower in your back.<p>Just like with any exercise, don't push yourself too much and make sure to keep proper form.",1359673174

People would do pair-trading on GLD-GDX pairs to bet on convergence.<p>Given that there's a binary catalyst event for natural gas, I wonder if there's a viable strategy to identify the thinly traded natural gas producers and exploit the stale quotes by market-makers (if the laggards are not responding as actively as the more liquid traded natural gas companies like CHK).<p>On the other side, I wonder if in a highly volatile event where a lot of punters would bid up leveraged natural gas ETF (GASL) above its intrinsic value, and you can take the other side of that trade and hedge with more liquidly traded UNG or FCX options or futures market.

Do we penalize the tech who clicked the wrong link on a dashboard, or the guy who wrote the dashboard such that a critical action contains no safeties or confirmations? Or do we penalize the manager for not having any established documentation on protocols surrounding triggering critical actions?<p>The only reasonable stance here is to collectively take responsibility for the failure. It may feel good to hang someone out to dry, but in all likelihood their failure was only the final link in a long chain of failures that extended well beyond themselves.<p>You root cause what led to the event (going deeper than ""a tech clicked on the wrong thing""), and you fix the root cause, and you move on.",1359672104
5147959,comment,5146381,5147769,2,0,coffeemug,,,"This is a great question. We start a thread per core, and multiplex thousands of coroutines/events on each thread. When coroutines on different threads need to communicate, we send a message via a highly optimized message bus, so cross-thread communication code is localized. This means each thread is lock-free (i.e. when a coroutine needs to communicate with another coroutine, it sends a message and yields, so the CPU core can process other pending tasks). The code isn't wait-free -- a coroutine might have to wait, but it never ever locks the CPU core itself. So, as long as there is more work to do, the CPU will always be able to do it.<p>If instead we used threads + locking like traditional systems, we'd have to deal with ""hot locks"" that block out entire cores. Effectively we solved this problem once and for all, while systems that use threads + locks (like the linux kernel) have to continuously solve it by making sure locks are extremely granular.",1359672085

More importantly, using timestamps without a common reference point makes it impossible to assert what happened first, because the absolute value of the timestamp does not matter. What matters is what ""really"" happened first. Of course, everyone's view of ""first"" can differ, but that's a different issue.<p>Whether there is signal here or not wasn't my point. There may well could be. My point was simply that the analysis provided by Nanex is spurious without a definition of the timestamps, where they came from, and their relationship to known reference points. Taking three events with a timestamp from each of: CQS, CME, and an arbitrary point in time such as 10:30:00 and then asserting that events observed within a CQS or CME event stream happened ""before"" the arbitrary point in time, 10:30:00, is impossible.<p>Unless either (a) one observes CQS, CME, and the event scheduled for 10:30:00 from a known reference and accounts for all variables (differing transit latencies, etc) or (b) each of the generating events are known synchronized and the current state of that synchronization is observable (CQS lags CME by 475us, government event source leads CME by 1.2ms, etc).

It even has a built in web server now.<p>2) Lots of useful functions.<p>3) Lots of useful extensions.<p>4) Weak datatypes. Newbies don't have to deal with too many error/warning messages. (and yes, i wish PHP had a strict typing mode).<p>5) The documentation is absolutely amazing (at least for the popular things).<p>6) The community. Even before StackOverflow, your PHP questions would be answered instantly.<p>Yes, PHP has its problems, and it does allow you to easily mix the PHP, HTML, JS all in on file, but while many people consider that as a path to shitty code, I consider it an easy way to tinker and try things, which is very valuable for beginners.",1359670583

Django mainly came into existence as a formalization of a lot of helper functions that The Lawrence Journal-World newspaper found themselves building over and over again when they built web apps. Adrian Holovaty, Jacob Kaplan-Moss, and Simon Willison created Django separately from Rails, even if it wasn't released publicly for a while (and then got kinda stuck at 0.96 for a while after that).<p>It's like Newton and Leibniz with calculus or Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace with natural selection; there were a lot of similar problems to be solved in the web dev space in the early '00's, particularly around accessing databases, structuring URLs, and handling authentication, it makes sense that a few similar approaches would show up around the same time.<p>If you're really interested in the history, this ""Snakes and Rubies"" video is worth watching: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9KDt9aXc8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9KDt9aXc8</a><p>(I should mention that I tend to personally prefer Python to Ruby, very much like Django, consider Adrian Holovaty a friend and we both once worked at msnbc.com at the same time.)",1359670573

Quick HN search revealed one such discussion: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=667308"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=667308</a><p>Back to the current situation.  There are many sources of market data.  Each individual exchange generates its own feed, and with the major exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, BATS, DirectEDGE, ...) you can colocate in the exchange data centers (NYSE and ARCA are in Mahwah NJ, NASDAQ is in Carteret NJ, and various other exchanges are located in New Jersey and Chicago) and record the data yourself.  There is a unified tape (CQS/CTS) which combines and disseminates a combined record (across all exchanges).  This is used to determine the ""national best bid/offer"" -- the prices people are willing to buy/sell at.<p>The process of CQS generation is fraught with problems, but lots of older traders and academic types use CQS data because its much cheaper to get that data than to get data from individual exchanges directly.  However, you are subject to the quirks of the combination process, including subtleties regarding timestamping data (since this data includes trades and quotes from Chicago and from New Jersey, the sequence of events may appear different if you record from chicago or new york or philadelphia or some other place; if you ask the exchanges to timestamp directly, you have to worry about clock delay and skew between the exchanges' servers).<p>nanex is saying that it is acceptable to depend on that data and any anomalies must have occurred outside of the recording process.  I am saying that the recording process can create the types of anomalies that nanex is showing, and that the only way to be sure is to record the data directly and carefully synchronize your recording machines.  <i>AND</i> when you do that you see that there really is no anomaly.<p>Just to emphasize how sloppy the exchanges are with regards to timing: on the BATS exchange they use multiple servers to run trades and generate quotes, and every once in a while you see messages appear to be out of time order because the individual machines weren't properly synchronized (although, if you filter for a single ticker, messages are always in chronological order)",1359669962

As far as I understand, event-driven design and coroutines (i.e. cooperative multitasking, lighweight threads, etc.) are the techniques usually chosen to AVOID concurrency.<p>How does such a design imply multicore scalability?  Obviously, coroutines and event loops don't prevent you from running in multiple cores.  I just fail to see the correlation.",1359669739

The fact that the retailer is written on the card and restricts my choices cannot possibly be a plus in my opinion.

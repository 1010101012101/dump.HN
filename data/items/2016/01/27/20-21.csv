On-campus residency is an optional feature, and MOOCs can help education scale better, but in the end, you need to somehow 1) compensate experts for the time they spend teaching material and evaluating students, and 2) even more importantly, implement a robust accreditation system to eliminate the temptation to loosen standards in order to raise enrollment.<p>What you end up with ends up looking a lot like a college.

With the commute time eliminated, you could add the gym to the morning routine, if there&#x27;s one you can walk to in a few minutes, or failing that, some bodyweight exercise or yoga videos. The only time I&#x27;d see this as a downside would be if you bike to work, but you could just go bike for that amount of time if you want, just ending up at home.<p>- less time with your friends and colleagues<p>Seems like this should be &quot;more time with your friends, less time with your colleagues&quot;? Unless your friends happen to live near where you work and you can meet up easier afterwards. Very situational.<p>- less team lunches/nice dinners<p>I guess on the lunches, but you shouldn&#x27;t be having dinner with your colleagues anyways, since you shouldn&#x27;t be at work at dinner time. Also, working remotely allows you to <i>make</i> more nice dinners, because you can take 5 minutes to do some minor prep that requires the ingredients to rest afterwards - allow dough to rise, marinate things, etc.<p>If the company is spending money on nice dinners, I would prefer to receive the cost as additional salary - that applies to beer fridges and ping-pong tables as well, is this a frat house or a serious engineering company?<p>- getting dressed can help you mentally make the switch to start your workday and can translate into higher productivity<p>Well, you can still do that if you want to. I usually dress better on weekends because the office is kept at what seems to be 80Â°, so it&#x27;s impossible to wear my sport jackets or sweaters in the winter <_<<p>- you have to spent money for office equipment<p>Much less than the commuting costs anyways, assuming you already have the computer and you&#x27;re just using a little paper for sketching. They probably provide a computer anyways, so you&#x27;re just looking at paper and pens?<p>- you have more sick days, since kids are bags of disease<p>Well, that only applies to people with children.<p>- no eureka moments after water cooler chats<p>I find it much more likely that someone else&#x27;s chat will destroy my flow, although that problem is fixed by providing private offices with doors that close.<p>However, I work on a team where I am solely responsible for my piece of software, so YMMV in larger teams with more direct code collaboration.<p>(I used to work remotely.

Creative techniques must be used in both games to cull out large chunks of the search space.<p>I definitely see how the more simplistic movement rules (and lack of variety of piece types) in Go would make it easier to cull off large swathes of the search space.

Because the debugger was so powerful, you could use it edit a method and &quot;go back in time&quot; to replay execution with the new version.

Understand that this is not limited to Wordpress. The types of vulnerabilities they test for are universal: password brute force, directory permissions, code injection, XSS, etc.<p>Sometimes one of these tests works, a site gets hacked, and then the developer has to a) recognize the site has been hacked, b) diagnose the problem, c) patch the hole, and d) recover the site.<p>For open-source projects like WordPress, the developer can then contribute the patch back to the community, and everyone else can pre-emptively fix their sites, even if they haven&#x27;t been hacked yet. Bad guys also get these patches, and add automated attacks based on them. These are often what you see in WP logs, but such attacks are easily defeated by simply applying patches when they come out.<p>For custom-developed sites, you the developer must do all those steps by yourself, and yes that means you probably won&#x27;t know about vulnerabilities until they are exploited.",1453927462

This means things like eliminating the mortgage deduction, property tax deduction, special cap gain rules, getting rid of Fannie, Freddie, FHA, forbidding the Fed from buying up MBSs, eliminating the homestead exemptions, and getting rid of no recourse rules.

10983040,comment,10982340,10982340,0,0,patcon,,,"Based on my own experiences of transitioning voluntarily into homelessness, I am very excited by the focus on lowering the cost of living. Living more simply, and getting there by a slow and intentional process (NOT coercive or painful), leads to more enjoyment of life, and less fear of failure. Funny how living in the presumed failure state of western society recalibrates your instincts.<p>I find myself wishing that something like the process I went through could be institutionalized to a degree. For example, I had to be previously indoctrinated on the value of minimalist living. I had to be convinced that that was something that I wanted. And I had to consider all my habits and responsibilities, and what I might be willing to give up to get me to different outcomes. I had to understand how cheap it could be to exist in the city in which I live, and then cut in order to get there. I had to let friends know of my goals, and hope that we could create new traditions that sacrificed little and perhaps even strengthened our relationship. The whole time, you are altering your habits, testing them out before removing the harness. For example, when I wanted to stop requiring my bathroom space, I started going to the gym every morning to shower. Once I was used to that in my daily routine, I then started doing fitness and running while I was there. And when I didn&#x27;t want to come back for food, I started putting together a minimalist meal plan that I could prepare in advance and take with me for the day. Reworking my habits and needs was almost a full-time job for a few months. Anyhow, I would never assume most people would want to take it as far as I did. Everyone&#x27;s path would be different, as their responsibilities and routines differ. But that slow process of change if life-altering.<p>I am now living in San Francisco for perhaps $300/month, and living very happily (perhaps moreso than ever), although El Nino is a recent complicating factor :) I will likely upgrade from hammock tent to camper in the near future, as I don&#x27;t want to strain relationships with my partner. But up till now, it&#x27;s worked very well.<p>And I want to clarify that I would never see minimalism the goal, but just a means to happiness and resilience. In any process that might resemble my own journey, taking something away should always be a choice made for future benefit.<p>Perhaps making that benefit more concrete could be part of any institutionalized program. Pay generously at first, but then expect costs to come down, and the more they come down, the more &quot;reward&quot;. Perhaps that could be a retirement bonus. Or access to some sort of YC investment portfolio that would essentially be retirement reward. So the cheaper you learn to live, under the guidance of the program, the more of a nest-egg you earn.<p>Anyhow, apologies if this is less than coherent -- lots of thoughts in my head on this topic. I am very not in the &quot;tech solutionism camp&quot;, and am pretty self-aware that my experience would be less a prescribed path, but rather a general template :)",1453926855

I&#x27;m wondering why the value network can be better trained with the refined policy network.<p>2.

The assumption is that a full-time employee works two thousand hours a year. Under my proposal, we will raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour which will set the so-called maximum income at $3M a year.<p>Of course, we do not want to penalize people from making more money. Nobody shall go to prison for making more money. I just think that any income over the maximum income should be taxed at a higher rate which I propose should be 90% of the income over maximum income.<p>If/when we get a basic income system working, we can switch the so-called maximum income to a hundred times the basic income. I hope the mega rich will support this plan as unlike the estate tax, this is not a tax aimed at the eroding their assets. As long as they do not take distributions from their corporations/ trust funds/ &quot;charitable&quot; funds, their assets should remain safe.<p>I know the federalists will turn in their graves as I say this but we cannot afford to have state and local governments do as they wish. When Texas steals business from California or Kansas steals business from Missouri, the consequences are just the same as when China steals business from the US.

Every startup is inherently working to lower the cost of living, whether that&#x27;s their stated goal or not. Even a seemingly useless app startup - if it becomes successful - will (1) add jobs to the economy, (2) give employees and their families more purpose and well-being (working brings people fulfillment and joy), and (3) contribute to lowering the cost of living[1].<p>Obviously, some startup industries (education, medicine, etc.) have a more direct influence on this process than others, but they all contribute in indirect ways to increased prosperity overall - even if motivated by purely &quot;greedy&quot;, capitalistic ideals.<p>If basic income were somehow to be implemented by providing basic <i>needs</i> (food, shelter, clothing, etc. rather than currency) without the involvement of other people/companies <i>providing</i> those needs, then I believe it could work. The trouble is, even in a world full of automation (and less need for typical jobs), the resources will still be controlled by organizations, governments, and people - and not always the people who have the most need for them. In that environment (and lets face it, certain people, countries, organizations, etc. will always be better suited at doing things than others), the economy <i>is</i> actually zero-sum in the meta sense. No one can consume without another party producing - even if the producers at some point are just owners of machines. And in a competitive economy, things like basic income just become factored into the cost of living, so it&#x27;s kind of a moot point.<p>From another angle, if basic income is ever implemented in terms of currency ($x per month), it will <i>not</i> solve poverty. I have plenty of first-hand experience to tell you that a large number of people will <i>choose</i> to live in poverty (or forgo what most of us consider to be basic necessities) by spending that money in foolish ways (gambling, addictions, frivolous purchases, etc). Those people will not accept responsibility for having wasted the money, and we&#x27;ll be right back to where we are now: people demanding more welfare services from the government.<p>[1] A successful but useless (practically-speaking) app/game means that people are willing to pay for it. Paying for a good or service that otherwise would not exist contributes in indirect ways to technological progress (e.g., by gaining more adoption, the technologies powering that app will be in a better position to improve and contribute to aspects of our lives that have more practical value), including more investment into things that <i>do</i> improve our quality of life per dollar spent.",1453926381

It is true that banks can&#x27;t lend out &quot;reserves&quot;, if by &quot;reserves&quot; you mean the 3% reserve that banks in the &quot;upper reserve tranche&quot; at the Fed (which is basically any bank you&#x27;ve ever heard of) have to keep in their accounts at the Fed and not lend out.<p>But the actual balances of those banks at the Fed are far in excess of that 3% reserve requirement; they are being kept in &quot;reserve&quot; by the banks not because the Fed requires them to but because the banks choose not to lend it out. Why would they do that? They aren&#x27;t saying, at least not publicly, but the obvious hypothesis is that it&#x27;s because their expected rate of return from lending it is lower than the rate of interest the Fed pays on their balances. In other words, they are worried about borrowers defaulting and driving the banks into insolvency and then bankruptcy, and the government refusing to bail them out because it wouldn&#x27;t be politically acceptable this time around.<p>So the reason inflation has been so low is that most of the several trillion dollars the Fed has printed in the last few years has never actually been put into circulation. (The doublespeak about &quot;collapse of the money multiplier&quot; is just a roundabout way of saying the same thing.) Which says nothing at all about what would happen if that amount of money <i>were</i> put into circulation, as it certainly would be if printed money was used to fund a basic income program instead of &quot;quantitative easing&quot;.",1453926249

He presents machine learning (ML) as though it is the entirety of artificial intelligence (AI), bases his assessment of the field on a false dichotomy between the largely distinct groups of supervised & unsupervised learning techniques, and unfairly reduces the achievements of AI down to &quot;pattern recognition&quot;.<p>AI and ML are not synonymous. They are related, and there is a great deal of overlap between them, but the fundamental goals and approaches are largely different. Machine learning is primarily interested in studying what you can learn from data - for some suitable definition of the word &quot;learn&quot;. Artificial intelligence is the more broadly defined problem of studying algorithms that exhibit or incorporate intelligent solutions to problems. That may involve data, or background knowledge, or domain assumptions, or a variety of other things. AI is about more than data - even as he observed that it is a sign of intelligence that humans do not require thousands of samples to learn.<p>The central challenge of AI is not in transitioning from supervised learning to &quot;general&quot; unsupervised learning (whatever that means). The techniques are different, and often used for different things. There is some overlap, and they are clearly related - but it is not at all accurate to conflate unsupervised learning with &quot;common sense&quot;. In broad strokes, supervised learning is about identifying features in the data that correspond to labels, while unsupervised learning is about identifying intrinsic features in the data. It sounds like he&#x27;s interested in bootstrapping supervised techniques, or perhaps transfer learning.<p>My first response: ugh...yet another famous and lauded geek icon wading into the subject of AI. At least this doesn&#x27;t seem to be in any way connected to all the Nick Bostrom garbage. But if I&#x27;m allowed some snark, perhaps if he wanted to be an AI expert he should have stayed in school... ;-)",1453926232

Then, if and when computers can write novels which you&#x27;d prefer to read over the best human author, now we&#x27;re talking.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of similarity. Take math theorem proving, which is an active area of machine learning; the algorithms tend at the moment to look something like create a tree of possible theorems, then the algorithm tries to traverse down the tree towards the target theorem by evaluating each branch by the probability it leads towards the target. Because of the exponential explosion, it&#x27;s very important to select good theorems to expand at each level of the tree, and the ML algorithms can learn characteristics of good intermediate theorems by learning on the existing corpuses of machine-checkable proofs, which gives them much higher success rates in reaching target theorems. So right now the best theorem-provers can already reprove a lot of existing proofs.

10982823,comment,10979418,10981768,0,0,danbruc,,,"I am actually not sure that this is true. I used to think exactly like you, that rotations are just piles of small translations with time varying directions, but there is a problem with this, linear momentum and angular momentum are two different conserved quantities. If it were the case that rotations are just translations then you should be able to get rid of angular momentum and its conservation and explain it in terms of linear momentum and I don&#x27;t think that you can do that. Linear momentum is tied to the homogeneity of space while angular momentum is tight to the isotropy of space. You could actually do the exact opposite, say that translations are just rotations about a point infinitely far away, but I think that won&#x27;t work either. I really don&#x27;t know for sure, I mean I am not really, really, really confident about it, but as far as I can tell rotations and translations are  fundamentally different.<p>Unaccelerated translations make only sense as relations between two objects but you don&#x27;t need any reference to detect acceleration, you can just release an object from your hand and see if it drops to the floor because of gravity, hits the wall behind you because your space ship is accelerating or flies away tangentially because you are on a carousel. Rotation requires continuous acceleration (I am avoiding the term constant acceleration because only the magnitude is constant but not the direction) of all the particles towards the center of rotation or otherwise they would fly away tangentially. But if rotation requires continuous acceleration and you can always detect acceleration without reference to some other outside objects then you can always detect rotations and that is not true for translations, you can not detect unaccelerated translations.<p>It is the difference between velocities and accelerations and the fact that rotations always require accelerations that makes rotations more than just a pile of translations. You won&#x27;t notice any difference if you translate everything in space by the same amount, you won&#x27;t see any change if you rotate everything in space by the same amount, there is also no difference if you change the velocity of everything by the same amount but you will immediately notice if you change the acceleration of everything.<p>Or maybe that is at least partially nonsense, unfortunately I haven&#x27;t yet mastered that topic myself.",1453925552

On the second turn the second player is similarly resticted to 20 possible moves causing the total number of chess board configurations after two moves to be 400.

Otherwise, following the study, people will surely say that what was tested is very different from what was proposed.<p>- Systemic effects would be relatively hard to evaluate with such a study, an example would be the change in both absolute and relative prices: e.g. I would expect that after a wide adoption, housing prices in cheap and mid-level areas might rise more than in currently expensive areas, because the added income would change the purchasing power of lower-income households by a much larger percentage -- or perhaps not.

Seems a lot more efficient to give everyone money rather than spend $100M on bureaucratic infrastructure for verification and employment tracking.<p>2) It benefits society because you no longer have to work to live. This affects how you make decisions about your employment. You would be more likely to change jobs when you&#x27;re unhappy, for example. This is good.<p>3) Whether you make $40k, $100k, or $500k, the $10k isn&#x27;t there to prove &quot;additional income support&quot;. The system could be set up so that after basic income is implemented, your disposable income is the same as it was before--people making $40k wouldn&#x27;t have $10k in free money to spend, because their taxes would go up $10k a year, for example. The key here is that if they choose not to work for some period of time, they can. That&#x27;s not how I think it ought to be implemented, but the principle is true.<p>4) If government handed out $10k to everyone, they could tax everyone $10k and it would be like nothing happened. The difference in implementation would be that the additional taxes would be progressive, while the benefits are flat. So if you make over $100k a year, you might be taxed $15k more than you were before, but you would also receive $10k.

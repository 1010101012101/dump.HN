Loading all data at start is pretty simple and efficient. In this regards, there is another problem, getting the changes from memory back to the disk. Writing all data to disk, and even overwriting existing data is out of question, so such a system is needed which saves the changed data incrementally. Is there such a ""database"", which: a. loads up all the data at the start + loads the incremental changes, b. writes the incremental changes in transactional manner to disk, while not messing up the OS paging? I wonder if there is such a ""persistent paging file"" library available?",1369000364

5734554,comment,5733456,5734088,13,0,skybrian,,,"""In a classic study, Cialdini and colleagues manipulated the signs that were displayed in Arizona’s Petrified Forest National Park, a site often plagued by tourists who end up grabbing some of the petrified wood to take home as a souvenir. In situations like this, the first inclination of well-meaning environmentalists might be to set a strong prescriptive norm — perhaps by saying something like, 'Many past visitors have removed the petrified wood from the park, changing the state of the Petrified Forest. This is bad, don’t do this.' The idea here would be to invoke a sense of shame and severity before asking visitors to refrain from taking the wood. But read that prescriptive message once again. Is there anything descriptive in there? Yes, of course there is. That message is not just telling you that you shouldn’t take the wood — it’s also telling you that most other people do. In fact, people were actually more likely to steal wood from the forest when they saw the sign telling them how many people tend to do it themselves, even though the very next sentence was asking them to refrain. But when the researchers simply tweaked the message to read that 'the vast majority of past visitors have left the petrified wood in the park, helping to preserve the natural state of the Petrified Forest,' the thievery plummeted.

You're experience went a little further than mine, I got no offers. Ah, what a blow to the ego.  ;-)<p>Regarding the banging on URLs: I don't know if they are becoming more sensitive to that. I did a little digging around via various URLs but never got cautioned on it. You may have gotten a little deeper in to it, or you touched a raw nerve that I didn't stumble upon. :)<p>I was surprised by how few companies actually viewed my profile. They provide the list at the end of the auction and it was interesting to see how it matched up with my own. Philosophically you have to look at it through a cautionary lens:<p>How many companies do they have on their list?<p>How many companies do they have on their list are hiring for a technical position <i>right now</i>?<p>How many companies do they have on their list are hiring for a technical position <i>right now</i> and looking for the skills I have?<p>How many companies do they have on their list are hiring for a technical position <i>right now</i> and looking for the skills I have are hiring at the level I am at?<p>How many companies do they have on their list are hiring for a technical position <i>right now</i> and looking for the skills I have are hiring at the level I am at and making a realistic offer?<p>I also noted that DeveloperAuction uses Craigslist and LinkedIn to hire their own programmers. Obviously <i>their</i> pipeline is broken or not mature enough and they aren't eating their own dog food.<p>I sympathise on being dumped in to other companies' generic hiring pipelines once the auction is over. That is a huge disconnect between promises made and the cold, reality of finally getting to a real, sign on the dotted line offer.<p>Agreed on the Junior developers. There is a fallacy about the tech talent shortage. If you are young, naive, willing to be overworked and underpaid then $100K is a lot of money when you're straight out of college and the only two things you are worried about is whether you will ever have a girlfriend and how much longer can you defer your student loans for.<p>I think there's only a shortage of tech talent at the lower levels where the machine that has been created by SV and its ilk cannot feed it fast enough with warm, young bodies (that sounds wrong somehow, but you know what I mean.) But this is a discussion for another time and another thread.<p>The hiring process and pipeline is definitely broken. It is exhausting to go through each company, follow-up, schedule interviews, take time away from work. I am ramping up my “looking for work” efforts right now in anticipation that the start-up I am co-founder of runs out of runway before it can take off. “Dig your well before your thirsty.”<p>The code on github is never looked at. Not by the “technical recruiters,” not by the hiring managers, not by the engineers and so on. I have sat in an interview and been asked point blank, by the same group of people gathered at once, “do you still code?” “Can you write software?” “Have you ever worked on OpenSource?” and then been told at the end that they felt I “didn’t code enough on a weekly basis to make a significant contribution.” You stand there with your mouth agape at the sheer, unadulterated willful ignorance and lackadaisical interviewing attitude of people some days.<p>I co-authored slash maintained RGBDS for about 8 years until retiring from active development.

Basically they have 30+ GB of these flat files. Literally millions of them. All in *.dat files. It works quite well like that. But the downsides as discussed in the link crop up and cause problems.<p>So we tried to put them into a few SQL databases as LONGBLOB, and after the first couple of gig the thing just became unmanageably slow, badly formed queries would cause it to lock up, and the thing took up way more space on the file-system than files did (and was WAY harder to manage with the performance issues discussed).<p>So I guess my point is, SQL databases are great for sorted data.

5734432,comment,5731164,5733041,3,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Sort of like NULL, especially in that both NULL and Nothing mean ""the absence of a value"" and cannot be combined or compared with anything else. But it goes way beyond that.<p>Think of Maybe as a container. It either ""contains"" a value, or it doesn't. The container itself is not usable except for passing around; it's the contained value that is important. Even if we know that the container is supposed to contain a number, we can't use the container to perform computations; every time we need the number, we need to open the container, peek inside, and decide what to do whether it's contains something or nothing.<p>In Haskell terms, this ""peeking inside"" is typically done with pattern matching, which is core to the type system. For example, this is a function that checks if a Maybe value has anything, and returns true or false:<p><pre><code>    hasValue x =\n      case x of\n        Just _ -> True\n        Nothing -> False\n</code></pre>\nThe line ""Just _"" is a kind of wildcard expression, meaning: ""Check if x matches the pattern Just [something]"".<p>At the opposite end, we can have functions that produce Maybes (naive and simplified example, not working code):<p><pre><code>    fetchPage url =\n      do response <- performHttpRequest ""GET"" url\n         case (getStatusCode response)\n           200 -> return (Just (getBody response))\n           404 -> return Nothing\n</code></pre>\nNotice how ""Just"" looks like a function call. That's because it is. It's a function that ""constructs"" a value of, in this case, type ""Maybe String"". The ""Nothing"" returned is also a value of type ""Maybe String"". Thanks to Haskell's type inference, this is known at compile time.<p>In languages such as Java or Ruby we can build classes that are containers that act in a similar way. But those languages are limited in that ""peek inside the container"" logic needs to happen at runtime. In Haskell, the container's possible values are enforced entirely by the type system at compile time.<p>To really appreciate this, you really have to be familiar with statically typed languages such as C++ or Java. In such languages, you have ""nil"" or ""null"" or ""NULL"" values to represent ""nothing"". Any time you have a pointer, you have to explicitly check if the pointer is valid; if you try to use it, and it happens to be null, the program will blow up at runtime, but not at compile time.<p>In Haskell, there is no generic null value. The value ""Nothing"" on its own belongs to a specific type, such as ""Maybe String"", and won't work with another such as ""Maybe Integer"". Thus when we want to use ""fetchPage"", we are forced into a situation where must make a choice based on whether there is a value or not (again, naive example):<p><pre><code>    crawlPageRecursively url =\n      do contents <- fetchPage url\n         case contents of\n           Just s -> map crawlPageRecursively (map (\\body -> getLinks body) s)\n           Nothing -> putStrLn (""Failed to fetch "" ++ url)\n</code></pre>\nSince Haskell doesn't have null pointers, and can never end up in a situation where you try to use a null where you expected a value, because its type system makes it impossible.<p>This was my attempt at ""explain it like I'm five"" Haskell as carefully as I could. The real world is somewhat more complex, but not awfully so. As you say, too often haskellers will get into ""formal academic theory"", even when, in my opinion, it's not necessary. Haskell becomes more elegant and beautiful if you study and know group theory, but most people don't, and it really just obscures the language for ordinary, mortal programmers who are trying to learn it.<p>As for monads, it's true that Maybe is a monad, but think of it as a convenience, in the sense that this lets it play well with the rest of the monad infrastructure. You can use, and even implement, Maybe without involving the monad aspect.<p>My best suggestion regarding monads is to just start using the language; as DanWaterworth points out, monads are pretty much inexplicable for beginners until one really needs to use them. Haskell actually lets you use some monads (like IO) without requiring any deep understanding of what they are. Case in point: The above examples actually use the IO monad, concealed by the ""do"" and the ""<-"" syntax. But because this syntactic sugar makes the language look like an imperative language, you can use this stuff without too much deep knowledge about just exactly how it works under the hood.",1368998404

That is, programming where types and values have mathematically simple denotations that predictably compose exactly according to the syntactic composition being used.",1368997576

Thus since their are 4 rounds, .75^4 * 2/3 => 21% between the founders.<p>However, in this case it appears that Marco wasn't a co-founder, but rather a first employee with an equity grant.  If it were for 5%, it is probably worth ~1-2% now, and so I'd reckon he will see $15M.  That is a lot of money, but not enough to change the startup landscape.",1368997422

The problem isn't really that some guy said ""fuck"" in a MineCraft video; it's that such language is usually bundled with an attitude of ""fuck creepers"" and ""I hate those shithead zombie pigmen"" and ""this game is being a bitch by not giving me enough diamonds"".  If you replaced those swear words with euphemisms (or even very clever expressions of the same emotions), the underlying problem still remains: the attitudes and emotions are not what I want my kid emulating.",1368997357

Spelling and grammar isn't the best indicator. A spammer in the US will typically have a good understanding of American communication style, thus, they are good at the social engineering aspect. The problem with spammers in the US is that it's pretty difficult to fully conceal your identity. There is always something in common or amiss with the account details. For example, if your billing address is based in the US, but you're connecting to infrastructure with IPs outside the US. Or better yet, chatting with me via an IP in the Netherlands.<p>I think the best example of a US spammer was this guy attempting to promote his blog. (Or trying to warm up his account before sending spam) Each post was a rip off of an article from About.com. All the post dates were adjusted to appear that the site was online for months. His spelling and grammar were excellent.<p>He had several flaws... The domain was just registered a couple days ago. The ""Corporate HQ"" address on the site was a post office in New York. The billing address was a UPS store in Nevada. He refused to talk to me on the phone or provide a physical address that I could send a t-shirt to. :-P",1368997319

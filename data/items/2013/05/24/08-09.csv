5761875,comment,5761558,5761558,3,0,mtgx,,,"Let's just admit that what these companies are doing is pretty sneaky, and unfair. If they <i>actually made</i> $5 billion with their business in Ireland, then I'd be fine if they only paid 1% in taxes or whatever are the taxes in Ireland. Same for their businesses in any other country. Maybe they pay 5% in some, 15% in others, 30% in others and so on.<p>They should abide by local laws, and pay taxes on whatever they are making there. They are doing business there, so clearly they believed that market is worth it for them, and it should be worth to pay the taxes there, too - after all if they do pay a lot in taxes, most of that will be transferred to the consumers in those local markets anyway. But what they're doing is taking their cake and eat it, too. Making those customers pay more, but then avoiding paying the taxes that were most likely already included in the price the consumers paid there.<p>Then taking virtually all the profit from all the countries and transferring it to Ireland so they pay the absolute minimum, while <i>pretending</i> they are barely making anything in all the other countries, because they get their Ireland subsidiary to take all the money, so there's ""barely anything left"" to tax in other countries - <i>is not okay at all</i>.<p>Some may say that it's Apple's ""duty"" to do this, but it's their duty in the same way it's their ""duty"" to sue many other companies for infringing on ""slide to unlock"" and other such trivial patents, by (legally) <i>abusing</i> the patent system.<p>So just because it's not illegal to do something, and it's their ""duty"" to maximize profit <i>by any means necessary</i>, doesn't mean we should pretend it's ""morally okay"". It's also the governments' duty to fix these loopholes, and restrict the companies from doing this as much as possible (some international treaty is going to be necessary). And I also think it's the consumers' duty to not be okay with this, and protest against it.",1369385884

5761872,comment,5761297,5761297,12,0,Sanddancer,,,"I know someone with FOP, and this pretty much fits his experience. His is a mild case, but he carries crutches because his knee sometimes locks from one of his attacks -- muscle sprain in childhood -- and he needs its support. He's also talked about the pain going to the doctors becomes at times, because pretty much everything is handled by specialists, or with their consultation, and he just wants to get on with life.<p>One of the things that this article doesn't touch on, though, is the difficulty in getting treatment and effective care for comorbid diseases. Because these diseases, especially things like FOP, can manifest in odd ways, they tend to lump all of the other abnormalities together, even if the other symptoms run completely counter to what the disease does to others. So, standard diagnostic batteries for the other diseases aren't run, even if such a diagnostic would be useful in managing body issues that can and do come up. Thankfully, though, he's managed to get a decent amount of day-to-day coping skills with his other disease (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome) from the internet. It still would be nice for him to get a firm diagnostic, so that interactions and symptoms could better be monitored.",1369385839

A more general one is that we already accept the idea that corporations and individuals are governed by different tax laws so ""Why shouldn't one be exactly like the other?"" has a somewhat flippant reply in ""They don't, already, for various reasons, so why should they be?""<p>But I don't think the objections (or counter-arguments) to Apple's behaviour as simplistic as that - it's just I don't quite understand what the source of the controversy is and was hoping that someone else did.",1369385838

5761862,comment,5761297,5761800,5,0,Ygg2,,,"I guess you could say taking any position to an extreme is bad. However each of these diseases opens paths to future cures. It helps us understand human body better. And those cures will open ways to more ideas, etc. Without diseases we'll never have a chance to explore. I'm not negating those defects don't leave their parents in despair, but I speak from a position of a similar though magnitudes way milder defect (hip displacement). Eugenics taken to extreme would have discarded me.<p>Eugenics on small scales does have some advantages, though I fear it would bring advantages in a way that will only widen inequalities i.e. only people with money would have enough money for it. Rich people wouldn't just have money, but also best looks and best health.<p>Eugenics on large scales is on the other hand simply disastrous as it leaves monoculture and erradication of anything perceived as abnormal.",1369385664

I've given some thought to how we might build drivers in languages that don't support lambda functions and unfortunately, there don't seem to be any good answers.<p>The actual underlying S-expression syntax for ReQL lambda functions is pretty ugly by itself and I'm glad that so far we haven't had to expose it. The python `lambda x,y: x + y` actually gets compiled to something like the following: `(func [1,2] (add (var 1) (var 2)))`. Variable references have to be constructed manually no matter how you do it. With native lambda functions though you can at least hide those constructions behind the scenes and bind them to the function's formal arguments.<p>Fortunately though both C++ and Java, the two ""traditional"" languages we would most like to support, have either just (in C++11) or are about to (in Java 8) introduce lambda functions rendering the point moot.",1369385535

One of the few groups that do have the knowledge to use tools and preferences to get around the problem. I'd be leary of generalising that to other markets.<p>* You're a/b testing on max-width setting - not line length. So a bunch of your users in both groups are going to get exactly the same experience if they're on smaller displays. This will make the improvement on larger displays seem less significant.<p>* Tests like this can be really skewed if you have audiences that shift device over time (e.g. getting popular link tweeted and retweeted can push sometimes push up the mobile portion of a site enough so that certain display types work better/worse.)<p>* The line length is something that has interactions with other typographic features like line spacing and font size. Optimising on one alone can lead to poor results.<p>I'm not saying that you're wrong - but those are things that occurred ;-)<p>In general what the research done by others indicates is that users prefer shorter physical line lengths, but read faster on some longer line lengths (within limits obviously - backup <a href=""http://www.usability.gov/articles/newsletter/pubs/082006news.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usability.gov/articles/newsletter/pubs/082006news...</a>)",1369385345

The whole point of having Irish subsidiary is to give it intellectual property which is the real money maker here.<p>What happens then is quite simple. Subsidiary company in Ireland is charging Apple in other countries huge licensing fees. In fact, so huge that it amounts to 100 billion dollars. Licensing fees are tax deductible so Apple is basically avoiding paying corporate tax all over the world because licensing fees and royalties eat up all the profit.<p>Of course, Apple as a group of entities is making billions in profit but as far as overseas tax authorities (Australian Tax Office, UK Revenue & Customs etc) are concerned, Apple is barely breaking even therefore is not paying its fair share of tax.<p>Obviously this whole scheme comes at cost. All these billions are basically stuck somewhere in Ireland and can't be used. They just sit there and earn interest.<p>Eventually money will have to come to America. How? Irish subsidiary will pay dividends to parent company Apple Inc. At that point all these billions in profits will get finally taxed at ~35% by IRS.<p>Congress is just asking Apple when they are going to bring to USA all those profits and what's the point of deferring it. Apple is saying, we will bring it when you lower our tax rate. They are basically blackmailing the government.<p>edit: I was wrong by saying Apple doesn't pay corporate tax in USA.

At best there's no difference. Very commonly it confuses and does the opposite of what the site designer wanted (that people find it easy to get back to their site).<p>For example I've see the following happen on ecommerce sites on multiple occasions:<p>* On site we're testing, tasked to buy a Foo<p>* Find some external link that opens in a new window<p>* User views the link, hit's back button - back button fails (it's a new window)<p>* They then just <i>Google for ""Buying Foo"" of similar</i><p>* Pick a new site - probably amazon or some other familiar name<p>* Continue with the purchase elsewhere<p>People understand how to return to your site when they visit another.

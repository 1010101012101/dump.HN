It partly depends on market and business idea though.

As of the mid 1940s the best error bound on cumulative roundoff error was 4^n where n is matrix order.  That 4^n would be a multiplier on top of condition number (which at the time had not been formalized, it was Turing who did that).<p>Anyway, the dependence on matrix size turned out to be order n^2, and in practice more like O(n).<p>* * *<p>Also, the bounds on solving<p><pre><code>  A x = b
</code></pre>
for x, knowing b and A, work differently than solving for the inverse of A.<p>Sometimes for a given A and b, you can compute x above quite accurately, but you can't compute inv(A) accurately and multiply by b to get x.  It depends on the how the ""difficult directions"" in A interact with b.  This is one reason numerical analysts always ask, ""Do you really need to invert A?""<p>Because of this, the actual condition number of A (i.e., the norm of A times that of inv(A)) does not enter into the bounds on solving A x = b.  The bounds depend on a different norm.<p>In fact, there are several forms of the error bound -- known as backward and forward errors -- depending on what you need.<p>* * *<p>Incidentally, this is the kind of stuff that's covered in Golub and Van Loan, or in Trefethen and Bao, but not in a standard Abstract Linear Algebra book.

I say 'nominally' because they are generally of the form 'you cannot receieve frequencies used by celluar telephones' like this document: <a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/guides/interception-and-divulgence-radio-communications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fcc.gov/guides/interception-and-divulgence-radio-...</a> outlines.<p>There is also rule making about what radio broadcasters have to pay to rights holders when they broadcast said content.<p>And importantly, the FCC at least (and probably the Candian equivalent) don't put 'streaming audio' over the internet in the same category as broadcasting at all, rather it is a re-distribution of content. And permission to do that has no 'standard' for acquiring rights applied to it.<p>You need only look at Pandora's attempts early on to pay exactly what the radio stations pay to play music which was defeated in the courts. Pandora negotiated a separate contract for payments for that music.<p>Or to try to listen to a major league baseball game over the Internet by going to the KNBR web site and listening to their player app. (which goes silent when games are on)<p>Bottom line is, the content owner gets to make the rules with regards to who, how, and when their content can be consumed/received. All of this crap has been hashed out several times in the courts by several different parties.<p>Two things are very well established via litigation:<p>1) Streaming isn't broadcasting.<p>2) The content provider has the exclusive right to say who can or cannot use / listen / access their streamed content.<p>I <i>understand</i> that it sucks and is anathema to folks who feel like if they write an app that can pick up an audio stream and play it then they should be allowed to do that, however since I follow this stuff and its goings on I am familiar with how content owners have prevented folks from being given that right. Davander Mobile didn't understand that, because if they did their blog posting would be 'Oh darn the CBC figured out what we are doing and now we have to take our App off the App Store.' I speculated that their lack of understanding came from it being their first encounter with the world of intellectual property regulation and that was probably unfair, I have no basis for evaluating their cluelessness and should keep my speculation to myself.",1315942491

The drag for me is that when I was 30 they said I was too young - now I get the looks that I may be too old.  All BS of course, because being a start up founder is all about commitment, risk, passion and flexibility.  You have to have 1000% commitment not just for yourself but from your loved ones - if they're not on board with belt tightening and living off credit cards at times, with you working 18 hours a day - 7 days a week, with the inevitable ups and downs, high probability of failure and willing to hang in there in the bad moments ( because a great start up founder must maintain a positive and optimistic perspective to their team - translation: you're family will bear the brunt of pent up angst).  Then this isn't for you.    On the other hand, it's thrilling to be in the middle of a hot space, building your dream, exchanging ideas with bright people, understanding a market better than anyone else, most importantly the joy of learning new stuff and doing new stuff every day and of expanding your skills beyond what you thought you could do then do it.   Notice I never mentioned money - if that's what you want, then stick with your job because it'll provide what you need.  Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg, etc,  never ever mention that they do it for the money - it's never about the money.",1315942466

So to predict how things will shake out, we have to be a harsh on Windows 8 - it won't look any better next spring next to the iPad 3 and Android 4.0.<p>It's really weird for anyone that's followed technology for more than a decade, but Microsoft computers will have almost no special appeal to the average consumer.

But having pet projects is not a pre-requisite for employment anywhere.<p>If you can not assert the ability of your applicants during an interview by asking them job related questions then maybe you should let someone else do the hiring?<p>> Sometimes people pets projects are working on a large open source project, for employers I believe that is the jackpot, you have their communication with users and peers, the output of their work and the thought processes that go along with it.<p>That is absolutely the <i>wrong</i> reason to go for this particular applicant because that is simply none of your business. You get what you pay for, the time they spend on the jobsite and the output they generate during that time. You have zero title to 'their communications with users and peers' and so on, and if you lay any claim to those then you're a very bad company to work for (yes, I know there are companies that do just that).<p>> Employing people is not about giving every developer in the world an equal opportunity for a job, its about finding the best people for your team in a minimum amount of effort<p>Surprise. Employing people is all about fairness and treating your applicants - and your employers - with dignity. What they do or do not do during their time off is none of your business.<p>The reason I would not want to work for a company like that is because I would doubt the long term viability of a company that sticks their nose in places where it does not belong.<p>Typically this is indicative of a 'we hire people like us' mentality. You will likely find that places like that employ just stereotypical copies of the person that runs the place instead of being representative of the workforce in general.",1315941532

Despite spending what is in my many cases billions of dollars a year on IT and related underwriting systems, most of the major health insurers in the US still have some manual touch involved in their pricing, which means that they can't price in anything near real-time. Even the best can do perhaps half in a fully automatic way, yet generally choose not to do it in realtime (for reasons I'll never fully grasp).<p>One major insurer that I'm familiar with receives applications from the biggest of these sites by fax, on paper. They're then shipped to a low cost country, where they're scanned, and then passed along to another low cost country to have the OCR corrected. Then the work comes back on-shore to be manually adjudicated. Figure 3 days minimum, a week on average to get all of this done.<p>A crowd-sourced solution would be astronomically useful. For it to be accurate, you need to capture a decent amount of medical information (most insurers ask a pretty standard set of ~20 questions), but even knowing that the average person pays 1.4x the quoted rate for someone of their age/gender/zip would be a great tool.",1315940857

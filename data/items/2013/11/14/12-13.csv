However, to really get the ease of development you&#x27;re looking for you&#x27;d probably use VS to build/debug the backend, and additionally, the dart editor (special eclipse version) to debug the front-end.  You&#x27;d have to enable your backend to support CORS calls for this type of setup.   However, Once you are ready to deploy, the app builds to HTML/JS/CSS files that you can just embed normally in your solution.<p>I think what you&#x27;re getting at is - is it better than JS or typescript + angular or backbone?

6731985,comment,6731492,6731749,3,0,zamalek,,,"Agreed. StackExchange doesn&#x27;t like conjecture, but here is my logical argument in support of your conclusion.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that an argument is made asserting that quantum mechanics are not probabilistic and are actually deterministic over the entire area of the universe. The reason we see QM as a probabilistic feature of the universe is because our &quot;determinism reference frame&quot; is incomplete.<p>For example, within in the room you are sitting in right now there is a determinism reference frame that indicates that when you press a key on your keyboard a letter will appear on your monitor - that reference frame is actually incomplete. Half way across the galaxy a star could explode, the &quot;cosmic ray&quot; from that star could interact with our atmosphere and ultimately flip a bit in your RAM[1] - causing a kernel panic in the worst case scenario. Computers are only deterministic machines if the determinism reference frame does not include the entire universe. This means to assert that something in our reality is truly deterministic we need to have perfect information about the entirety of our reality (I specifically avoid the word &quot;universe&quot; in that statement).<p>The next piece of information that is important is that physicists believe that our universe may have been formed within a Higg&#x27;s Field (which is why the hunt for a Higg&#x27;s boson is such an interesting area of physics). This means that there is plausibly a volume or something (not necessarily a universe itself) within which our universe was formed. Conjecture: is this encompassing &quot;metareality&quot; the reason we have non-determinism in quantum mechanics? Is our universe simply a &quot;room&quot; within another reality? <i>Keep in mind, I am avoiding multiverse, the Higg&#x27;s Field doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be compatible with the multiverse theory and it&#x27;s hard to make the analogy I am trying to make without it sounding like I am venturing into that territory.</i><p>The problem is that we can only observe our own universe, if our universe does exist within another reality (which the existence of the Higg&#x27;s boson points toward) it means that our universe is ultimately non-deterministic. It would be impossible to determine if that metareality is deterministic because we cannot observe it.<p>Therefore, there is a good chance that the universe is not deterministic. It is impossible to tell if reality is deterministic.<p>Edit: and then there is this [2]. Determinism is very likely a human concept that has absolutely no meaning in terms of reality, it&#x27;s a convenient simplification just like Newtonian physics.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Single_event-upset"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Single_event-upset</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/jul/20/technology2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/jul/20/technology2</a>",1384433562

6731953,comment,6731492,6731492,6,0,asgard1024,,,"I would say that the determinism or non-determinism doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>It seems to me that determinism is a feature of the observer too. For example, roll of dice is non-deterministic for a human being, even in perfectly deterministic universe. It&#x27;s just too complicated to simulate, so it appears random, and we can pretty much declare it to be non-deterministic.<p>And pseudo-random generators, purely idealized systems, can generate non-determinism from determinism. You can also have systems that do the opposite - that are itself based on non-determinism, but are in the effect deterministic. Classical computers use non-deterministic movement of electrons (or better say, they don&#x27;t rely on their determinism), but can still produce repeatable (deterministic) results.<p>So you can move away from determinism or non-determinism on lower level (like the level of elementary particles) by various methods of aggregation. Considering there is still about 20 orders of magnitude between the &quot;size&quot; of elementary particles and Planck length, I would dare say that reality may still switch between determinism and non-determinism several times beyond the what we know.<p>Also, people may find this lecture by Dan Dennett interesting (which inspired the above argument): <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxup7sxIUmg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxup7sxIUmg</a>",1384433058

Those systems are extremely safe.<p>Most hobbyist designs, like the one in this article, do not have such protection. Indeed, for this particular circuit, a simple static discharge, as might happen when you&#x27;re applying the electrodes after walking over carpet, can fry the input amplifier, connecting it to the power rails. ESD (and, indeed, defibrillation -- which is about a thousand times more energy than ESD) protection would be present and required in any medical biopotential amplifier, even unrelated to the single-point protection described above.<p>If the ESD failure happens to short out to power rails, your current will be your power rails divided by your electrode impedance. This distribution is described in EC11/EC13 (although electrode technology has improved since the days when those tests were done, so impedance is even lower).

Construction management is, at its heart an exercise in coordination. Performing that coordination efficiently requires looking at the big picture, and literally looking at a big picture 8 square feet at a time cannot be replicated on a screen.<p>What a slate does offer is the ability to access the backup - takeoffs, photos, subcontracts, correspondence, etc. while looking at the issue in the field. But a project engineer who only relies on an iPad to look at the plans before calling the design team is probably in for a <i>Mira Los planos</i> asschewing.<p>I will not be surprised to see the app be successful, but it will probably not revolutionize construction in the way AutoCAD changed design.

3691381,comment,3691113,3691287,6,0,drostie,,,"An implementation of exponential decay could quite possibly solve this problem, but it might mean that they'd have to dramatically rethink the ""new"" page.<p>Exponential decay is important because it is, as they say in statistics, ""memoryless"": it has a simple geometric property that adding a new point today has the exact same effect as adding a new point on the first day. It can therefore be implemented as follows: when you add points to a link, you add them not just to the total points, but also to some accumulator which I will call Hotness. This number is a double; we increment by 1 when someone adds a point.<p>Every half-hour, some independent process working over still-Hot threads multiplies their Hotness by 0.97153. This gives a half-life of about 12 hours: your rating has hotness 0.5 after half a day, 0.25 after a whole day, and so on. We could tune that if we wanted finer granularity. When something gets below 0.001 Hot we can probably just reset it to 0 Hot abruptly so that we don't check it anymore. (Because doubles will try to go to -infinity if you use them multiplicatively in this way, and if you get to, say, 1000 points this will still mean that we can stop paying attention to you in, say, 10 days.)<p>Suddenly, adding points to a dead article is the exact same as sponsoring a new article. So we store articles under their URLs as keys, and if you resubmit an existing news story you merely bump it up to 1 Hot.<p>The ""new"" page would be very peculiar in this system, though. It might work by listing only those 1 Hot posts which were 0 Hot previously, I don't know.<p>As for a major con to this approach, I think HN uses polynomial decay rather than exponential decay because exponential decay somehow didn't feel like it had the right ""shape"" to it or so. This is probably because they didn't implement it in the ""memoryless"" configuration, though, where each point has value 1 from the moment it's added, and decays slowly.",1331502189

And I agree that it's a trade-off.<p>But I think my point is, that from a usability point of view you simply have no other choice than having X codebases, one for each platform you want to be on, if you are not willing to compromise on usability.

My opinion (and what I tell my students):<p>Independent of the specific license, I would suggest listing sources (and uses) of all external code in your LICENSE file, and at the header of each file. This makes it much easier to check for license compliance later on. Most open-source licenses require attribution but do not explicitly specify how this should be done.<p>Example: ""check_for_update() from stackoverflow.com/... (CC BY-SA)""<p>Depending on the license of the code you are using, you might be required to mention its use in your application's documentation (e.g. BSD, CC BY).<p>If the code is in the Public Domain or is not sophisticated enough to be protected by copyright (thin ice!), there is no need to mention it in the source code.<p>If it is just a few lines of code, try to put it into its own function and add a short comment. This also allows you to easily remove problematical code later on.<p>Generally, if it is just a few lines of code, dealing with the license issues is usually not worth it. For example, you can not legally mix CC BY-SA code from Stack Overflow with GPL code. I would suggest just looking at the SO solution and writing your own implementation of the algorithm (not completely safe but probably the most convenient solution).",1331500286

The fields I studied aren't any narrower today than they were two decades ago -- the fields I studied didn't <i>exist</i> two decades ago.  They barely existed <i>ten</i> years ago.  And now there's a vibrant field of research.  The same is true all over the biological sciences, computer science, chemistry, biochemistry, bioengineering, etc.  The fields where a PhD means something are constantly re-inventing themselves, because the frontier of technology keeps getting bigger.<p>In the 1980s, Rodney Brooks at MIT was doing some interesting academic work with simple, toy robots, while everyone else was building thinking machines and planning systems and industrial robots.  Twenty years later, and there are <i>multiple</i> companies commercializing the technologies emerged from that work.  Some people might look at iRobot and say <i>""what an innovative startup!""</i>, but I look at them and see a company that has done a good job of commercializing 20-year-old technology.  They've definitely refined it since then, but the core technology was invented at MIT, in the 80s.  The same applies to nearly every ""hot"" technology that startups are pimping today -- dig a bit below the surface, and you find an iceberg of academic research.<p>And that's what I mean when I say that the startups of 2032 will be hyping academic research done in 2012.

I was not so shocked to find that call of duty had allowed itself more access than it asked for.  I WAS however shocked that there was another app allowed in the last 24 hours called 'Playstation Network' and it had a pagelong list of access permissions all of which were completely open and I had never been asked to allow that. (I'm pretty sure it just opened up every permission setting possible on facebook) Seriously, check it out yourself if you have the game on ps3.

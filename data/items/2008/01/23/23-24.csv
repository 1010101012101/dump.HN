I'm pretty sure apple will be able to hang on to the top 5% of the market. The top 5% can afford apple in spite of recession.<p>Heck, even in the good times, The CEO gets the macbook pro. everybody else gets dells. I would bet up to 43 cents the CEO continues to get the shineyest newest toys ever year, while grunt staff's computers are kept in service an extra 6 months to two years to save on costs.<p>Now, if you'd said they make their money from ipods, then I'd completely agree.",1201131754

It describes our ability to gauge what is really important from a very narrow period of experience. In other words, spontaneous decisions are often as good as - or even better than - carefully planned and considered ones.",1201131420

103153,comment,102945,103151,0,0,apathy,,,"Not sure that it matters -- if you have a less accurate chip, you just resequence (run it) to greater depth.  (If you can afford to, that is... and in all likelihood, they can) That's effectively what Helicos et al. are doing anyways.  Their call rate for whole-genome resequencing is on the order of 99.7% at a depth of 2; at a depth of 20-50 maybe it becomes useful.<p>If you think of the chip (hybridization) methods being depth of 1, eg. a single scan per sample across however many probes there are for a given SNP, then you can probably see where the synthesis methods win.  It's really cheap to re-run them.  It's twice as expensive to run 2 chips...<p>All of the sequencing-by-synthesis methods are less accurate but cheaper and ultimately more useful than anything based on the existing hybridization arrays (or beadarrays).  If you look at eg. the Personal Genome Project, there is a good summary from the Church lab about how eg. padlock sequencing is different from Affy/Illumina/Nimblegene hybridization arrays.<p>Also note that (1 - 0.999) * 550K  still gives 550 miscalls.\nD'oh.  (Another big win for sequencing by synthesis -- just do it again, and again, and again...)<p>This is what I'm getting at when I bitch about 23andMe not advancing the state of the art.  With the money they have, they could.  But they're not.",1201130957

103146,comment,102945,103140,0,0,apathy,,,"Ah, you are correct.  23andMe is using Illumina, Navigenics is using Affy.  I have my doubts as to whether either approach is truly useful at this point in time to non-researchers, but I could be quite wrong.  My objection to 23andMe and Navigenics and so forth is based on the inherently incomplete information provided by a static snapshot of a person's polymorphisms.<p>As far as email -- sure.  Though I don't know whether I'll be pleased to be associated with such a screed when the full details of their plans are more apparent.<p>Selling their database to pharma companies is exactly the sort of evil I'd hoped they'd avoid.

At one level I feel a bit sorry for the grossly overpaid executive. If they have a moral sense they must tie their minds up in knots to justify their pay to themselves. The good thing is that most of them, once the 'win' and prove what they set out to prove, do become philanthropic to one degree or another. The problem is that sometimes that philanthropy does not extend beyond their immediate families. :-)",1201129684

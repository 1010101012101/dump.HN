While power consumption isn't an issue directly it is an issue indirectly in the form of heat and coincidentally cooling.  A device without a fan is desirable from a noise perspective in a living-room, a cost stand point and a ""sex appeal"" standpoint (pretty case, tiny or no power brick, etc).<p>ARM systems can also be generally cheaper to implement as with many SoCs there is no ""chip set"" just the single SoC and a couple auxiliary parts.  Few parts and fewer traces generally results in a cheaper product.<p>I would _think_ but certainly don't know that maintaining a single set of optimized drivers would also be a win.  As many of the ARM SoCs share sub-components with the SoCs used already on android.  Thus there is a cost win in being able to use existing drivers.  On the other hand anyone that has used linux on Intel GMA video knows there are some ""issues"" with those devices and since android sits on linux, I would assume they had to do a bunch of custom work to get it working well (or maybe its just an X11 thing).",1322724531

The EX250's have notable shortcomings if you will only own one bike, for many years. I certainly advise starting on a smaller bike and upgrading, but many people obstinately refuse that course. I'm not sure if they are afraid of losing money in the process, or if it's an ego thing.",1322723579

Because of the BSE outbreak in the UK in the 80s (and the various smaller outbreaks later) the US authorities were scared shitless at some point. So if you've lived 5 or more years in Europe you're banned from donating blood forever.<p>Not sure I understand the logic... Quarantine for a set period I can understand, but banning for life makes little sense. After all there are many blood donors in all European countries and we don't all end up with mad cow disease when we receive blood transplants.<p>For comparison: After having lived in the US you are banned from giving blood in Denmark for 1 _month_",1322722891

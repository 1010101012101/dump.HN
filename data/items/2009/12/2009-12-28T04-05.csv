I am often not interested in pushing anything back to the master branch, nor in coding things ""just so"" in order to fit into some project's coding standards.   It's a matter of expediency.<p>(Yes, I do also submit patches to projects when I run into bugs I think I can fix. But here I'm referring to wanting a lib or app to take a different approach to things and to do things the right way, i.e. as James sees fit. :) )<p>In the past I would slurp down code as a tarball or maybe svn, and I'd go about my private alterations in secret.  Now, I push my quirky changes back into the daylight.  The upshot is that if anyone finds my changes useful they are free to take them and apply as they wish, with no cost to me.<p>It's a big improvement over the past, and observing that it still does not make things as easy as possible for the owners of the upstream projects is seeing the glass as half empty.",1261975975

1018093,comment,1018070,1018070,0,0,chipsy,,,"I tried supplementing with various forms of omega-3. It took me a while to figure out the exact correlation, but as it turned out, too much EFA in general made my skin bruise and swell up readily. Hence, the days where I took fish oil and ate almonds and a salad with oily dressing would leave me literally crawling to do things by bedtime because my feet had become so unbelievably swollen.<p>I dropped the supplements pretty quickly, but was now hyperfocused on the swelling, because it still cropped up occasionally, and, I now realized, had done so for years, but in the past I had just written it off. It took another six months to figure out that vegetable oils - regardless of their ratio of EFA content - were the source of the swelling. Once I got rid of those, problem solved.",1261975684

For most of the things I follow I would want to get all the posts, but I wouldn't mind a sprinkling of content I would be unlikely to find.<p>However isn't there a fundamental problem with trying to create an automated system that delivers content interesting to <i>you</i> and doesn't simply amplify what's already popular (this one's called Google)? At some point humans with taste and judgement have to read content, so I take the skeptical view that an rss feed (or something functionally equivalent) from aggregated news site read by like minded people is as good as it gets.<p>For a recent example see the Left Fold weekly newsletter. Almost every article has had a good run on HN/Slashdot/similar.",1261973963

1) Feeds of slashdot and 500 other urls leading to 10,000 ""news"" items a day.<p>These stories are stuff you would <i>like</i> to read, not that you must read.  This might die as it is just overwhelming and it will be replaced with filtered/recommended content.<p>2) Specific feeds of items that don't come up that often or don't have that much content where every post must be read.<p>This will <i>never</i> die.  This is extremely valuable.  Subscribing to a blog where the author posts every six months, subscribing to information about a bill going through congress, subscribing to a feed telling you whenever someone assigns a bug to you, a feed notifying you when someone posts a FooBar up on ebay (once every 8 years).  Whenever you want to get notified about something and you <i>will</i> read every story rss is extremely good.  The alternatives are you manually checking (time waste) or email (spam heaven).",1261973890

2) Pay a moderate monthly fee and a moderate per use fee.
3) Pay no monthly fee and the highest rate per use.<p>If you use the service rarely you can pay nothing most months. If you use the service regularly it is best to pay a higher monthly rate.

I probably felt the same as you when I first upgraded to C++, but that followed by some disappointment, too. I missed sets as first-class data, the subrange type and many other big and small things. And the object model was quite different. I'd even argue that if you forget about operator overloads in C++, the rest looks quite weak when compared with Object Pascal's OO model. The article mentions some, e.g. virtual constructors, properties, etc.<p>The rest is basically in the article. Lots of features that are still missing in the mainstream languages.<p>And most importantly, the final binaries you get with Delphi are indistinguishable (size, speed) from those produced by C/C++ compilers, if not better sometimes.<p>If I were OP maintainer, I'd probably bring the language to today's ""standards"" if that's the word, by adding just a couple of things - anonymous functions, probably yield semantics, also foreach and better support for built-in dynamic arrays.",1200591280

99846,comment,363,363,0,0,cperciva,,,"Make it possible to lose karma by submitting garbage stories, either via downmods or (IMHO the better option) by making submitting a story ""cost"" a certain number of points of karma (which of course will be regained if the story gets voted up).<p>Recently I've seen two trends, both of which significantly diminish the value of Hacker News:<p>1. Some users are flooding Hacker News with submissions (in one case I counted 18 submissions in one day), and even though most of their submissions aren't being voted up, enough submissions are to make them accumulate lots of karma (which I assume is why this is happening).<p>2. The same stories are being posted many times by different users.  I'm sure this is partly the result of #1 -- with the floods of submissions users might not realize that a story was submitted before -- but the fact that there's no ""penalty"" for useless submissions probably contributes as well.",1200590508

I'm very familiar with the model in which changes to a web app get pushed out quickly.  But this felt different because (a) it was the result of a conversation with the users while they were using the site, and (b) I typed the changes into the repl of the running server, iterating through design options (and debugging) on the fly. These changes are still not released; if the server crashed and restarted, they'd disappear.  (I saved them to a file on my development machine, and the server crashes rarely enough that I'll almost certainly release the latest version before that happens.)",1200590009

Don't get me wrong, I'm reasonably good at math, and took linear algebra and econometrics for fun, but I don't know what to read on my own and in what order for application to CS.

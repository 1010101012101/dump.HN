Right now the FDIC regulators take the stance that your bank is &quot;guilty until proven innocent.&quot;<p>One bank was getting examined to determine if it was engaging in unfair lending practices. The regulators pulled 6 loans at random from the bank&#x27;s portfolio. 3 loans were to men, 3 to women. Then they looked at the average interest rate on the loans to the men, the 3 on the loans to women. They found a .5% difference between the male and female averages (the men had the lower rate).<p>The regulators fined the bank several thousand dollars and required it to adopt new processes to ensure that future loans were &quot;fair.&quot;<p>Had the regulators looked closer, they would have noticed that the three random loans to men all went to older men with high credit scores...and each male was in a white collar job (doctor, lawyer, etc.). The loans to women, which were pulled at random, were each to younger women, just starting their careers.

For example:<p>>Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words. Do we have free will? Depends what you mean by &quot;free.&quot;<p>Well, yes, which is why philosophers have been trying to clarify the various possible senses of &#x27;free&#x27; and to determine whether or not we have free will in each of these various senses. Either we ignore the question, or we try to clarify it and answer it in one of it&#x27;s clarified forms. And indeed, philosophers have been doing the latter, quite productively, for thousands of years. If there&#x27;s now a third option, PG doesn&#x27;t bother telling us what it is.<p>>Meanwhile, sensing a vacuum in the metaphysical speculation department, the people who used to do literary criticism have been edging Kantward, under new names like &quot;literary theory,&quot; &quot;critical theory,&quot; and when they&#x27;re feeling ambitious, plain &quot;theory.&quot;<p>PG is apparently unaware of the resurgence of metaphysics in the past few decades.

10626795,comment,10626284,10626497,0,0,corin_,,,"Addiction is generally defined as not being able to stop an activity that rewards you in someway despite the consequences. With drugs like heroin it&#x27;s important to note the difference between chemical dependance and addiction. Chemical dependance can certainly cause addiction, but plenty of heroin addicts are (citation needed but I&#x27;m pretty sure) staying addicts because they want the high - which is the same principle as how people get addicted to gambling, or to weed (a drug that doesn&#x27;t cause any physical dependance) - not because they are trying to keep withdrawal symptoms away. Of course, plenty of addicts do at some point want to quit and at that point the dependance can keep them addicted.<p>Arguably the line between &quot;addiction&quot; and &quot;lack of discipline&quot; is subjective and arbitrary. It&#x27;s possible to be a heroin addict, decide to never do it again, and... just do it. I&#x27;ve no personal experience but know it must be hell to try and do that, but it&#x27;s absolutely possible. And former addicts, who no longer have any traces of the drug in their body, who have got past all the withdrawal... often relapse, for what you could call &quot;lack of discipline&quot;. Equally, many people are addicted to gambling in ways that leave them losing all their savings, or addicted to weed in a way that they get nothing done in life because they&#x27;re getting stoned all the time, or...<p>For me, the line would be drawn based on how hard it would be to give it up, and how much damage is being done. If you&#x27;re just annoyed that you spend too much time browsing the web, it probably shouldn&#x27;t be called addiction. If you spend 95% of your time in the office browsing the web, and are concious that this is causing major problems for you, but still can&#x27;t bring yourself to stop... addiction seems fitting.",1448453644

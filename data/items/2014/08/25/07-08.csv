This is not only about racism, people will usually do everything to protect their privileges and will show stubborn ignorance/aggression if you try to convince them to consider other points of view. Race, nationality, religion, sex, political preferences - any excuse for discrimination will do, maybe only in Scandinavia they teach children and adults to restrain their need for domination (with some success imho).",1408953538

Based solely on the situation as laid out in the article, the people deciding on using the system in this case should be strongly reprimanded for squandering trust like that.<p>If using the system in such cases is actually desirable, a lower tier of alerts that doesn&#x27;t make more noise than a regular text message should be introduced.

8220932,comment,8220240,8220542,18,0,rwg,,,"As someone who used to work for a university&#x27;s geosciences department as a Unix sysadmin/programmer and who worked on two different seismic monitoring networks (one spread across the state for earthquake monitoring and one parked on top of a coal mine), allow me to explain why earthquake monitoring in the United States is largely stuck in the stone age: There&#x27;s no f---ing money.<p>Back in the &#x27;80s, there were a <i>lot</i> of regional seismic networks around the country, especially east of the Mississippi.  But as time marched on and budgets got slashed, regional seismic networks disappeared one by one.  Today, only the largest regional networks survive — generally the ones that are mostly funded by the states they&#x27;re in and/or have increased their share of USGS/ANSS funding by taking over monitoring for areas of the country that used to be covered by the now-defunct networks.<p>The regional seismic networks that are left spend pretty much all of their dollars on equipment and operations.  Installing/upgrading/running permanent seismograph stations is <i>expensive</i> — a basic solar-powered one with a shallow fiberglass vault, a three component short period sensor, and a three channel digitizer will run you ~$12,000 just in equipment and materials.  The sky&#x27;s the limit if you go fancier than that (broadband sensors, strong motion sensors, atmospheric sensors, borehole sensors, six channel digitizer, elaborate vaults, VSAT, etc.).  Then there&#x27;s the recurring communications cost, the cost of regular site visits, the cost of regular battery replacements, replacing solar panels/equipment boxes that morons shoot at for laughs, etc.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that in the monetary battles of &quot;keep seismograph stations working&quot; vs. &quot;hire programmer to write useful software&quot;, the stations will win every time.  Even this LA Times article about Berkeley&#x27;s early warning system notes, &quot;A lack of funds, however, has slowed the system&#x27;s progress.&quot;<p>If the epicenter of tech wants to do something wonderful for earthquake seismology, figure out how to make dirt cheap 1- or 3-channel seismic digitizers (low-pass filter + low noise amp + 20-bit ADC @ 100–200 accurately timestamped samples/s, ≤1 watt average power draw @ 12 VDC, speaks TCP/IP over 802.11g/n) and dirt cheap 1- or 3-component short period sensors (1 or 2 Hz corner frequency, decent sensitivity).  Then figure out how to get thousands of these dirt cheap digitizers and sensors in backyards all over the country and contributing data in real-time to IRIS and/or the closest regional seismic network.  If the cost of acquiring quality seismic data goes down, that frees up money to actually do something with the data.<p>When I was still at the university job, my job-related pipe dream was to blanket the state with these non-existent dirt cheap stations.  Even one or two per county in my state would&#x27;ve increased our station count by a factor of >15, greatly improved the quality of our earthquake locations, and allowed us to determine focal mechanisms (the orientation of the fault and direction of the slip) even for small earthquakes.",1408952247

As such, it is going to be incredibly difficult to recover any usable information. There are some indications that using the right classifiers might improve results here, but their 10% accuracy for identifying digits is about equivalent to random guessing. Expand the corpus to include all of colloquial English (and potentially all other languages) and that precision drops to a very low number.<p>With that said, someone crafty may be able to convince the OS (most likely Android, in this case) to turn up the sampling frequency to 8kHz -- that same sampling frequency as POTS -- and there might be a real risk of this technique used as a data gathering technique (or at least a way to drain your battery really fast).",1408952119

We can do this with:<p><pre><code>  ghci> let a=1; b=a meter\n  ghci> :t a\n  a :: UnitTyped.Value Double LengthDimension Meter\n     -> UnitTyped.Value\n          Double\n          (&#x27;UnitTyped.UnitCons\n             * Length (&#x27;UnitTyped.Pos &#x27;UnitTyped.One) &#x27;UnitTyped.UnitNil)\n          Meter\n</code></pre>\nWe can see that, in the expression &quot;1 meter&quot;, &quot;1&quot; is actually a function. Looking at the source code [1], it seems like this is accomplished in a relativly hacky manner:<p><pre><code>  instance (Fractional f, Convertable a b, t ~ Value f a b) => (Prelude.Num (Value f a b -> t)) where\n\tfromInteger i x = Prelude.fromInteger i . x\n\t(+) = error &quot;This should not happen&quot;\n\t(*) = error &quot;This should not happen&quot;\n\tabs = error &quot;This should not happen&quot;\n\tsignum = error &quot;This should not happen&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis works because the &quot;+&quot; being defined here is Prelude.+, not UnitTyped.NoPrelude.+ (which is defined seperatly).<p>[1] <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unittyped-0.1/docs/src/UnitTyped-NoPrelude.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unittyped-0.1/docs/src/U...</a>",1408951352

You&#x27;ve identified a problem in the description we haven&#x27;t seen: the word &#x27;sanitizer&#x27; and the introduction lead to the assumption that CIRCLean is an over-engineered version of a media sanitizer, which only deletes files from a USB stick, packed into a Raspberry Pi.<p>In contrast - and that sentence is hidden somewhere further down in the description - CIRCLean takes files found on an untrusted USB stick, converts them into &#x27;disarmed&#x27; file types and stores them on a trusted USB stick:<p>&quot;CIRCLean is a independent hardware solution to clean documents from untrusted USB keys / USB sticks. The device converts automatically untrusted documents into a readable format on a clean USB key/stick.&quot;<p>We are going to rephrase the description.<p>Thanks again, and if you have additional comments, feel free to share them with us!",1408951048

Improvement of manufacturing process and distribution. Finding edge through creativity and understanding the needs of who&#x27;s buying.<p>And the progress is clear: a more sophisticated cultural environment that can be enjoyed by more people than before.<p>Of course there are trade-offs; progress does not arrive on your doorstep without some nasty side-effects. In the case of fast fashion, apparently: IP theft. Environmental damage. Widening gap between the classes.<p>So why should this corner of the economy be judged any differently than the layers of hyper-competitive tech companies in SF and SV, reacting to trends, improving their manufacturing process, and pushing design new limits?",1408950910

I spend very little time in front of the fridge, and never when anything but fully alert.  If the room started shaking, I could probably step a little to the left or to the right and be fine.  I&#x27;m probably more concerned about all the glasses on high shelves, or the knives, etc., in terms of floor hazards after the quake.<p>The thing which terrifies me is that I&#x27;m in a 1971-construction building with a soft story, in a city with a defective police department.  My car is parked in that soft story.  Assuming the entire building doesn&#x27;t collapse and kill me, there&#x27;s nothing above my-standing-height except one projector, which even from projector-height, would be unlikely to kill me.  But I&#x27;d probably have fallen to my death and been crushed by huge volumes of unreinforced masonry before that.<p>(Please, please, if there&#x27;s going to be an earthquake while I&#x27;m in the Bay Area, let it happened while I&#x27;m in the office, or even better, in a datacenter.

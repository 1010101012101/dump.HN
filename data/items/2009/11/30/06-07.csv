967467,comment,967048,967384,0,0,sketerpot,,,"I find Dawkins' remarks on religion tiresome because they usually seem so obvious that I can predict what he's going to say before he says it. When he gets interviewed about religion, he sounds like someone playing Tetris at a moderate difficulty level: mostly acting on reflex, because what else is there to do? My heart goes out to him.",1259563732

967462,comment,967048,967274,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"Dawkins does try to educate people, in fact from his book output he <i>mostly</i> tries to educate people - see for example ""the greatest show on earth"".<p>I think he has a specific reason for attacking religion, and it isn't to de-convert people. His intent is to break religion's special status as immune from criticism in polite society. There is this assumption that religion always does social good, is always well-intentioned, and even if it turns out to be mistaken about reality, it's harmless. This lets religions get away with all sorts of rascally behaviour - see the Catholic church in Ireland, for example. He wants them to be held to the same account as any ordinary organization, and not placed on a pedestal.",1259563285

The award size itself is not sufficient to know if it's worth the time spent, because you may not get that award. Taking the award size and multiplying it by the probability is a quick way to see if it's worth the effort. For example, playing lottery your expected outcome is less than the entry price even though awards are staggeringly high.<p>Does it make more sense now?",1259562373

They are either architecture astronauts or they try to turn it into a thesis paper.  Bonus: I once saw someone with a MS in some computer-related field remove RAM from a running computer.<p>My experiences with people that have had no academic experience but lots of real world experience have been just as bad.  I recently worked at a place where out of 14 programmers, only myself and three others had a degree.  They all, to some extent, shared some of the same qualities: they can get stuff done (in small projects), but usually in really dumb and expensive ways, and they display a poor aptitude for learning new skills and techniques, and can't think abstractly.<p>I don't mean to say that a degree is everything or will automatically make you a better programmer, but in getting one, you gain a foundation that you wouldn't otherwise get from work experience alone.",1259561592

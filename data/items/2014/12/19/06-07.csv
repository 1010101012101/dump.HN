Maybe I&#x27;m reading to much into it, but everyone else (Reuters. Telegraph, FT and a lot of others) seem to agree. In any case, all I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;d that it represents increased pressure, nothing more.<p>As for not mentioning Google directly, that&#x27;s not really a great puzzle. Google is the only search engine with any relevance in a regulatory sense, and MEPs have mentioned it before. Of course, they must remain impartial, but it&#x27;s not DDG they&#x27;re worried about :)",1418972222

8771356,comment,8768886,8770408,0,0,Animats,,,"Another Stewart Brand fan. I had a WELL account. I used to go to the Hacker&#x27;s Conference. No, computer technology did not come out of the hippie movement. It came out of the people who wore white shirts in the 1960s.<p>The Sidewinder story is interesting.  I used to work for Ford Aerospace, which made the things at another location.  The China Lake crowd developed proximity fuzes, designed to turn a near miss into a hit by detonating the warhead close to the target on a near miss.  If they could do some steering correction, they could turn even more near misses into hits.  The pilot using an early Sidewinder still has to get on the tail of the target, but they don&#x27;t have to get as close.  Sidewinders usually either get a direct hit or a complete miss, because the heat-seeker gets more accurate as it gets closer.<p>The competing radar-guided missiles of the era were trying to lock on at much longer ranges and hit the target on their own, like surface-to-air missiles. That&#x27;s a much harder problem, and the electronics of the era wasn&#x27;t up to the job.<p>The &quot;China Lake culture&quot; was simply that there wasn&#x27;t anything else to do out there but work (it&#x27;s in the middle of the Mojave Desert), visits from the top brass were rare, and they had all the facilities to build and test weapons without having to outsource fabrication.  Plus they had planes, pilots, an airfield, and a bombing range. So a lot of work got done.  China Lake was also a joint Navy-university setup with Caltech. (JPL, as a Caltech/NASA operation, is similar.) So they had access to theoreticians when necessary.",1418971918

8771353,comment,8768754,8771012,0,0,akiselev,,,"> The problem with using exclusion in order to solve social problems is that sooner or later the group need to start hating others in order to validate a continuation of the exclusion.<p>I think this is a matter of perspective. When a certain section of a population (50% in this case!) is passively or actively discouraged from participation, I don&#x27;t view an event like this as exclusion of the majority but as radical inclusion of the minority.<p>YCombinator plays a significant role in the community around tech entrepreneurship and, most importantly, how that community is portrayed to the rest of the world. I don&#x27;t see how this relates to the Black Panthers which were started, as you say, as a response to institutional racism. If I were a gambling man, I would bet that the Black Panthers would have had much more of a cultural impact than they did if they were born out of, and were actively supported, by the same institutions whose behavior they fought against.<p>Furthermore, humanity&#x27;s tribal instincts aren&#x27;t inherently bad and often they serve a useful purpose. Who here hasn&#x27;t band together with like minded individuals for support whens faced with adversity?

If you use same password everywhere, you can't selectively share it. E.g. if I want to share the iTunes account with my GF, I have to tell her what the password is.<p>3. Internet access point user id/password sometimes is given to you. E.g. Farimont presidential club gives you free internet at their hotels, but you need to remember a 10-digit code.<p>4. You don't want to have same password on digg and on your bank. The probability of password leak is proportionate to its use frequency.",1221259792
302780,comment,302467,302467,0,0,tptacek,,,"The only hard analysis in this post is that enterprises don't adopt corporate IM; they just use AOL IM instead.<p>First, enterprises <i>do</i> adopt corporate IM. For instance, Notes shops use SameTime. Microsoft shops use whatever comes with LiveMeeting. You don't pay attention to these, because enterprises don't adopt IM <i>from startups</i>. I'm surprised when I meet enterprise IT people who don't have some kind of internal IM.<p>Second, enterprises <i>don't</i> simply use AOL Instant Messenger; take any 10 of my clients, and 8 of them don't even allow their users to connect to OSCAR (and 4 of those filter GMail as well).<p>Finally, Twitter isn't IM. Nobody really knows what Twitter is yet. If you had done this same analysis for the retail Internet a year ago, you'd quickly come to the conclusion that Twitter is a stupid idea even for home users. But then, Twitter happens anyways.<p>Third,",1221259773

Look inside any large enterprise, and you find that outsourcing is <i>all they do</i>; everything's white-labeled for everyone else, and a huge chunk of the revenue comes from relationships between the giants.<p>Large enterprises routinely outsource core business process to hosted web apps. Where security is concerned, my guess is virtually every Fortune 500 company does what our clients do, which is to keep a small internal pen-test team and contract third-party security testers to ""certify"" apps before they get deployed.<p>And, of course, outsourced hosted apps aren't the definition of enterprise software.

As a student majoring in Computer Science, I feel that the rules and regulations in the school really don't favor a business-minded programmer.<p>Personally, I really don't like the formal schedule that you have to follow strictly( imagine you have to go to your company everyday 0-5 ). Programmer usually likes to code when the ideas come. And, this ""productive time"" is varied with person.

302766,comment,302390,302390,0,0,sd,,,"One major problem with this article is that it confounds content-based sites with the web.  Just a quick sampling of Alexa's Top 100 Sites for about 10 random countries indicates that Google, MSN, and Yahoo (or their localized versions) are frequently among the top ten most visited. So there are in fact some truly global sites on these here interwebs.<p>What types of site vary the most between countries?  Sites that produce content, like newspapers, all-in-one portals, and video sites.<p>Maybe the problem with Hulu and Pandora isn't just their complex licensing agreements, but also the content that they license.

302755,comment,302696,302696,0,0,palish,,,"His courage is admirable, but unfortunately misplaced.  His job was to <i>test</i> next-gen consoles.  It shouldn't have been surprising that he'd find bugs.  And since he was a tester, he likely saw far more bugs than most end-users, simply because he was looking for them.<p>I empathize with his frustration with Microsoft.  He probably felt like they were not listening to his reports, or if they were, that they were focusing on problems that he believed to be less important.  However, as a game developer, I understand why it can take a very long time to respond to a playtester's bug report.  In the game industry, you're constantly working on improvements.  There really is no downtime.  So, tester identifies bug; tester reports bug; manager schedules bugfix; developer finishes what he's doing; developer reproduces the bug; developer fixes the bug; developer does a ""programmer test"" to verify that the bug is actually fixed; code is checked in, which is queued to be deployed; and finally, the bugfix is deployed back to the original tester.  It can take anywhere from two days to two months for certain bugfixes, through no fault of the process.  (A process like that is inevitable for codebases that are millions of lines of code.)  And once you throw in the fact it is probably difficult to deploy new code to consoles, and also that the testers aren't in the same building as the developers, that process can probably take quite a long time from the point of view of the tester.<p>So that said, I don't understand why he felt it was a good idea to be a whistleblower in this case.  There really is no big scandal.  If a console fails, Microsoft will replace it.<p>Also, I assume he signed a non-disclosure agreement, which he brazenly violated.",1221257561

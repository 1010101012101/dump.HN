5436369,comment,5433610,5435577,1,0,dalke,,,"""Can Adria be fired for stating publicly ...""<p>It depends on several factors. A company cannot use a legitimate reason for firing someone as a pretext for an illegal reason to fire someone. The courts will ask questions like: Does the company have a policy that if an employee makes an incorrect statement like this then that person can be fired? Are there examples of other employees who made an incorrect statement but did not get fired? Here's the actual EEOC statement:<p>> The anti-retaliation provisions make it unlawful to discriminate
against any individual because s/he has made a charge, testified,
assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding,
hearing, or litigation under Title VII ...<p>> The anti-discrimination statutes do not limit or condition in any
way the protection against retaliation for participating in the charge
process.  While the opposition clause applies only to those who protest
practices that they reasonably and in good faith believe are unlawful, the
participation clause applies to all individuals who participate in the
statutory complaint process.  Thus, courts have consistently held that a
respondent is liable for retaliating against an individual for filing an
EEOC charge regardless of the validity or reasonableness of the charge\26.
To permit an employer to retaliate against a charging party based on its
unilateral determination that the charge was unreasonable or otherwise
unjustified would chill the rights of all individuals protected by the
anti-discrimination statutes.<p>> Typically, pretext is proved through evidence that the respondent treated the complainant differently from similarly situated employees or that the respondent's explanation for the adverse action is not believable.  Pretext can also be shown if the respondent subjected the charging party's work performance to heightened scrutiny after she engaged in protected activity.<p>""If I have an employee who ...""<p>The law gives broad anti-retaliatory protections to someone who made a complaint. As I quoted above, the courts protect a claim made in good faith. ""To permit an employer to retaliate against a charging party based on its unilateral determination that the charge was unreasonable or otherwise unjustified would chill the rights of all individuals protected by the
anti-discrimination statutes.""<p>""Good faith"" is given a very broad interpretation. It's not expected that an employee will know the Title VII laws, nor know if a certain practice is actually prohibited under the law. However, if it was not made in good faith (the wording is something like ""no reasonable person would agree""), then that complaint does not have Title VII protections.<p>Also, the employee may not make unreasonable forms of complaint. The EEOC writes: ""[C]ourts have found that the following activities were not reasonable and thus not protected: searching and photocopying confidential documents relating to alleged ADEA discrimination and showing them to co-workers\17;  making an overwhelming number of complaints based on unsupported allegations and bypassing the chain of command in bringing the complaints\18;  and badgering a subordinate employee to give a witness statement in support of an EEOC charge and attempting to coerce her to change her statement.\19 Similarly, unlawful activities, such as acts or threats of violence to life or property, are not protected. ... If an employee's protests against allegedly discriminatory employment practices interfere with job performance to the extent that they render him or her ineffective in the job, the retaliation provisions do not immunize the worker from appropriate discipline or discharge.""<p>That tweet can be parsed in many ways. Does ""support me"" mean that the company agrees that hearing unwanted dirty jokes while at the workplace is a valid reason to complain? Does ""support me"" mean that the company supports her legitimate use of Title VII protections? Does ""support me"" mean that her supervisor told her she was supported by the company, but upper-level management later decided that she wasn't?<p>Given that a company is supposed to support an employee's Title VII civil rights, I think that there is a reasonable person (the law says 'a reasonable person' not 'every reasonable person') who would say that tweet is nowhere near the bounds of what is impermissible in a Title VII action.",1364208165

If the company only hires 3.5+ GPAs as a matter of HR policy and he turned a 2.8 into 3.7, that's ""for cause"" (even if he was a great employee) because there is an internally published and consistent policy and he didn't fit. However, if the person concealed a 5-month gap in employment history, that might have been a factor but the onus is on employer to establish that it constitutes ""cause"".<p>However, with this particular case (concealed felony conviction) the employer will have almost no controversy on that one when it comes to firing for cause. I don't think anyone doubts that. If he gets found out and fired, he can't expect severance.<p><i>Audits of everything he touched, with a view towards uncovering a repeat of his earlier deceptions.</i><p>Yeah, he's got to be whiter than white, ethically speaking, from here on out, <i>except</i> when there is strategic necessity. Avoiding long-term unemployment constitutes ""strategic necessity"". Once you're in check, the way he is, you really have to limit your lies and make them count.

5436271,comment,5391667,5426637,1,0,karuneshkaushal,,,"(Read your post and thought I would comment here)<p>I am a male. I have worked in 2 small Indian companies (I wouldn't call them startups) over the past 2 years. A year at the first and 6 months at the second. Almost all guys/girls in early 20s (I will be 23 next month).<p>We have a kind of <i>unfriendly-to-women</i> culture here in India, so I thought I would tell you what I think. Though reading about the current saga has made me think if this cultural thing exists here only or...<p>We had a girl in a team of 7-8 developers at my second company, and she was good at work. I have seen a kind of <i>disdain</i> for her as a female colleague, in the sense that her successes were obvious (easy task/project etc) and hence ignored, <i>and</i> her failures (at the milestone level or the occasional short term project) were obvious too, but not ignored between the males (including me to at least some extent).<p>About once a week or so, someone would say some double-meaning thing in her presence (99% unknowingly, or I am too naive), and she would laugh it off mostly, or simply ignore it. This made us respect her more, since she was letting us be ourselves (however stupid we were).<p>I think she made the males like her because of her good work and great nature. When a common friend (same team) asked me if he should get her to moonlight with him on some contracting work, I told him I would love to work with a developer like her. Since this was kind of <i>illegal</i> with our company, so me recommending her meant that I liked her as a developer and trusted her as a fellow professional/person.<p>However, she is just one person. There are many others too, and each of us, male or female or other has the right to think what we think and say what we want. In addition, we have the right to <b>not</b> listen to bullshit from others. The definition of <i>bullshit</i> varies according to the person, just like beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. I appreciate your point of view, but we have to appreciate Adria's point of view and feelings too. If she did not feel right about something, then that was that, and all she did was to get the (accused) guys away/quiet. What happened on the internet after that is, IMHO, a large slugfest, nothing more and nothing less.<p>Lets just change the perspective a bit.<p>I do not smoke, and will not appreciate people smoking near me. So, if you and your friends love smoking and you guys <i>are</i> smoking within a couple feet from me in a public place, I have the right to tell you guys off. If due to some reason, I feel that I should get someone in authority to help, say the police etc., then too I am not in the wrong. Because it might be harmless fun for you and your friends, but it is not the same for me and as a human I have the right to make it right for myself.<p>Yes, I do not like the way girls talk about shopping and little children etc., and I positively dislike the way a lot of them comment (without being mean) on my complexion or my big nose or (if they know me from school) the way I got defeated at judo once within 10 seconds, but I think the whole thing about Adria and the guy(s) got blown out of proportion. Probably because of her decision to take to a fully open medium like twitter. And two people have lost their jobs without too much of an issue.",1364205923

When you look at the costs of all the kit versus maybe an older OLPC type computer off ebay I'm not sure how well it stacks up.<p>Then again, it's probably pretty good in sunlight and despite the refresh rate issues considering idle time in an editor it might be a very good use of the e-ink screen.

Despite the ease of copying, innovation is quite strong in the industry and there is a great deal of competition.</i><p>I would add that, (1) the clothing industry is similar now  to the the time IP was being legislated so it was directly addressed rather than derived by similarity to other areas. Its a little more logical and true to the original goals of IP than areas that derive. (2) There is a big element of hivemind/zeitgeist/emergence in fashion because people invent their own outfit every time they dress. (3) The combination of innovative fashion & quality is what makes high fashion brands valuable. (4) the lack of IP protection actually fuels innovation as  a design will remain somewhat exclusive for a season only.",1364205611

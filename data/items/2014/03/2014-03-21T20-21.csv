To begin a discussion about religion with any attitude other than critical seems to incite a very negative response among most engineers (and tangentially, people who strongly identify with &quot;internet culture&quot;). An assumption of &#x27;rightness&#x27; is very strong on these issues, from both sides.<p>I have NOT noticed this at all with regards to nuclear power stations. I&#x27;ve found that there is a fairly even divide among &#x27;reductionist&#x27; or science-praising mindsets about nuclear being net negative or net positive.<p>just my two anecdotal cents.",1395435564

You can get someone to run an automated scan for $500 and give you a CSV file, but that is not maximally in your interests.)<p>I&#x27;d turn away any client who asked me to do appsec work, because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d produce work of a sufficient quality to justify the sort of rates I charge, but I do think I&#x27;m probably good enough to roughly scope appsec projects on technologies I understand well.  Example: Appointment Reminder is an architecturally simple Rails application.  I think an audit of the marketing site, application, and architecture would reasonably require probably 1 to 2 billable weeks depending on how much I asked you to plumb e.g. line-by-line HIPAA requirements, and that would probably run in the $4k to $12k region based on my understanding of prevailing rates for appsec work.  (I&#x27;m sure that if I had $25k budgeted for that audit many firms could find a way to get me my money&#x27;s worth for every penny of that budget, by the way.)",1395435006

7444799,comment,7443334,7444330,1,0,orware,,,"Thanks again Dan!<p>First off let me clarify for the volunteer work he is doing at the college he is not working on any of my software business stuff during that time (he is strictly working on the college stuff).<p>The software business stuff I gave him separately as something he can try working on at home (kind of like a take home assignment). Fixing a minor bug in the software, adding an additional parameter, etc. And so far this has only been one time, but I did like his work and so I started this thread to see what options I should look into if I wanted to have him work with me officially.<p>Let me go over Department of Labor test you mentioned and see how that&#x27;s going (this is strictly for his volunteer work at the college, not the one software business thing I had him do):<p>1. This one I wouldn&#x27;t be 100% on, but I am training him throughout the process, most of the things I&#x27;ve given to him are akin to what could be given as a class project. They haven&#x27;t been any of the major projects that I actually have to worry about, they&#x27;ve been little projects I would have had to say no to (examples include a website for a local veterans group, adding in some email sending functionality to an existing program, creating a web application to make a different automated process I already had in place easier to use).<p>2. I would definitely say this experience is going to be beneficial for him (right now his issue is not lack of capability, it&#x27;s lack of experience and a willingness from an employer to &quot;take a chance&quot; on him).<p>3. The intern isn&#x27;t displacing any regular employees (I&#x27;ve always been a department of one managing the college&#x27;s online services, and while I&#x27;m not hovering over his shoulder every minute, which wouldn&#x27;t be good for him, he does work closely with me under my supervision).<p>4. This one is a little weird, because of the &quot;no immediate advantage&quot; part and I&#x27;m not sure how to interpret that. I do know that on the days that he is on campus, since I have to spend a number of hours meeting with him and working with him as he goes about his work that my operations are impeded during that time so I&#x27;m not able to do my regular work as quickly.<p>5. The intern is definitely not entitled to a job at the conclusion of his volunteer work (and he knows that, but our goal is to build up his skills enough so that an employer will have an easier time hiring him).<p>6. The employer and the intern do understand that he is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.<p>So aside from #1 and #4 which are a little more open to interpretation, I would say if we&#x27;re just looking at the work he&#x27;s doing for the college we&#x27;re meeting the 1-6 criteria fairly well. Can I say it&#x27;s 100%, no and that&#x27;s not my job to worry about at work.<p>However, this whole discussion was sparked because I&#x27;ve had him try fixing a bug and adding some features to a small, free product I have (probably about an hour or two worth of work) at home and he did a pretty good job so I wanted to ask and see what options I have within my own means to pay him something and he could also help out the business.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to skirt around the legalities of the situation, if we&#x27;re not in compliance with the law, then maybe we shouldn&#x27;t have any volunteers (and historically we&#x27;ve only two prior to this that I know of). But I&#x27;m in no way trying to keep him as a volunteer forever. Our goal is to get him (and any of the students that attend the college) a job :-).<p>You seem to have the most experience in this area though, so from your comments I would say I should eliminate having him work on any what would be considered the &quot;software business&quot; on his own time unless some sort of formal relationship was in place in order to have everything completely legal and maybe even stop his ability to volunteer if, after you&#x27;ve clarified the interpretation of #1 and #4, it seems like we&#x27;re not meeting the Department of Labor test.",1395434695

Some observers objected to Go&#x27;s C-like block structure with braces, preferring the use of spaces for indentation, in the style of Python or Haskell. However, we have had extensive experience tracking down build and test failures caused by cross-language builds where a Python snippet embedded in another language, for instance through a SWIG invocation, is subtly and invisibly broken by a change in the indentation of the surrounding code. Our position is therefore that, although spaces for indentation is nice for small programs, it doesn&#x27;t scale well, and the bigger and more heterogeneous the code base, the more trouble it can cause. It is better to forgo convenience for safety and dependability, so Go has brace-bounded blocks. &quot;",1395434351

The &quot;go fix&quot; tool (which was used to port pre-1.0 code to Go 1.0) meant that Go never had a &quot;py3k&quot; moment[1]. This is not like python&#x27;s &quot;2to3&quot; tool, which is reasonably good, but still doesn&#x27;t handle every edge case.<p>My favorite part about writing Go is the &quot;go fmt&quot; tool. Because all code in the standard lib (and most third-party code by convention) is formatted using the exact same tool, it is very easy to read any Go source code I find online. I don&#x27;t need to worry about stylistic differences or bikeshedding. And the &quot;go fmt&quot; tool exists (and is so simple to implement) in part because Go&#x27;s grammar is so simple.<p>Go is emphatically <i>not</i> a Lisp (it&#x27;s not even a functional language[2]). However, this one trait - the ability to make deterministic and reliable syntactic transformations - are at the core of what make Lisp&#x27;s macro&#x27;s powerful[3].<p>Like Lisp, Go&#x27;s beauty lies not in the syntax but in the semantics. While I would appreciate a Go (or a Lisp) that had both more beautiful syntax <i>and</i>  beautiful semantics, I would not want to compromise one bit on the latter.<p>[0] (EDIT) For the PLT nerds & pedants among us, I think mehrdada is right - in actuality, the <i>grammar</i> (IIRC) is fully context free, but in other languages, many of the rules which define a valid program cannot be encapsulated by the language grammar (whereas a higher proportion can). So it&#x27;s less that the grammar is &quot;(almost) entirely context-free&quot; and more that the language is &quot;(almost) entirely described by its grammar&quot;.

Now, that aside… :)<p>With the definition of “lock-in” that you’re using, it’s very difficult to find any service that doesn’t cause the user to be “locked in”. There is always a cost to migration from one service to another. That cost might be code changes to support a new API or it might be capital expenditures to spin up a cluster of a bunch of different databases to provide the same functionality, or it might be the cost of hiring a specialized team of ops engineers to run said cluster..or all of the above. :)<p>So, yes, there is a significant tradeoff if you choose to use OiO - you are trading off the cost of building and maintaining a large system of databases for the convenience and speed of development. Even if we open sourced all the code to run the IaaS portion of our system, you’d still have to find the hardware and manpower to run it...and keep it running over the long term. Once you’ve built up your own expertise, you would pay AGAIN if you chose to migrate to something else.<p>There is no free lunch.

7444709,comment,7440305,7444091,4,0,ufmace,,,"All transactions take basically the same time to verify. The trick is more in the motivations of any potential attackers.<p>The heart of the Bitcoin system is the block confirmation system. Once a transaction has been accepted into a block and that block becomes part of the official blockchain, it becomes essentially impossible to perform any kind of scam or attack on that transaction, such as spending those coins somewhere else. Only one spend of a particular quantity of bitcoins can be in the blockchain at once, so any attempt to spend them again will be rejected.<p>The trouble is that this is relatively slow. Getting one confirmation on a transaction takes probably like 5 minutes on average, and could vary depending essentially on the luck of the mining network at that moment. Using 6 confirmation is the official recommendation, and this may be expected to take about 1hr.<p>It isn&#x27;t necessary to use the official recommendation, though. It&#x27;s always hard to attack the system, and the 6 confirmation point is where it becomes essentially impossible for even major governments to attack the system, but such strong security is not necessary on all transactions. So the question becomes, how hard do we need to make it for a particular transaction?<p>To guess at that, we have to look at attacks. I mentioned earlier completing the physical transaction after the initial arrival of a Bitcoin transaction through the P2P Bitcoin network, before any blocks confirming it come in. To do a double-spend in that scenario, you would put 2 transactions spending the same coins on the network, and arrange for one to hit the vendor&#x27;s system, while the other went out to the rest of the network and would be included in the next block. That&#x27;s tough to arrange though - who knows what nodes the vendor is connected to, and it&#x27;s impossible to know which miner will produce the next block. To have a solid chance at pulling this attack off, you would have to run a very powerful miner yourself, solve a block with a transaction spending some of your coins before another miner solved a block, then hold back that block, and perform your transaction at the target vendor between when you solved that block that you are holding and when another miner does.<p>That&#x27;s a window of a could of minutes, maybe, and it could take days or weeks or longer for your miner to solve a block that puts you in the position to do this. The timing is very tough to pull off at a physical store, then. And to do all of this, you have to be running your own independent miner, which is powerful enough to have a reasonable chance at solving a block in the next couple of weeks. But just running that miner as a normal miner means you&#x27;re likely to get the mined block reward, currently 25 bitcoins, currently worth $12,500, just for solving that block. Why pull the funny business with transactions for, say, a $10 sandwich when you just made over 1000 times that money by doing nothing?<p>So because of this, completing physical transactions after only a receipt of the Bitcoin transaction is a risk, but given the high difficulty and low reward to the attacker, and low loss amount to the business, it seems like a very acceptable risk to make the purchase process more convenient to the normal customers.",1395433728

Thus, if you have a <i>dynamic</i> DNS server that  queries your presence service, it can return exactly the hosts that are up right now as the round-robin set.<p>Right now, if you use SkyDNS[1] as your DNS server, and attach Skydock to the Docker host, this all Just Works. Most people want to use etcd instead of Skydock, though, so support for that is coming soon[1] too.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/coreos-dev/iklEYHh5JyE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/coreos-dev/iklEYHh5J...</a>",1395433290

He attempted to use it to change the state by agitating large portions of the population using that fact.<p>I would even say he was not so much looking to change the state, rather to destroy it, becoming a sort of dictator himself, without any thought to what that would do. This he did after a few years of sending out letter that made it very clear he would immediately execute half the nobility and clergy if he did come to power. It didn&#x27;t help that he had pissed off all of his teachers and environment with those letters. This is what his trial was really about, and of course it mentioned his rallying cries.Those were not the essence of the trial though.<p>Think about it. Suppose you&#x27;re an autocratic ruler in the middle ages, in Italy. Everybody&#x27;s writing letters, a lot of them calling for your throat getting slit. One more of these lunatics starts writing letters. Disturbing letters, lots of them. You ignore him, at this point, there&#x27;s 100 others like him. Then a few demonstrations happen, led by him, with hundreds of people calling for your throat getting slit on the street. This is unnerving, but happens regularly, most demonstration leaders are never seen again, so, again, you probably ignore this.

It is true that not many people are thinking about the effects of superhuman AIs, and there&#x27;s no harm and possibly some good in a few smart weirdos focusing on that, especially since corporations have been around and critiqued for so long.<p>However, we are so far away from producing anything remotely close to that level of AI, that I fear their work is ungrounded. It strikes me as fun quasi-SF rather than serious engineering.<p>But I take believe they are seriously interested in world improvement, so my suggestion to them in their work on &quot;benevolent goal architectures&quot; is to study how existing goal architectures work, that is to look at existing economic and social systems where disparate individual goals are coordinated into cooperative or conflicting action, and how the results are related to human goals and human flourishing.<p>For my part, I am in the process of trying to understand their friendly AI work better so I critique it from a more informed standpoint.",1395432587

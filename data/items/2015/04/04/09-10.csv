I also play and have a decent-sized collection, and courtesy of working at large tournaments I get to know a lot of the big vendors.<p>For the last year or two there have been waves of concern in the broader community about runs of counterfeit cards allegedly being printed in China; some of the cards they target are old and rare and quite valuable (up to hundreds of dollars per card for the genuine article), while others are just more recent tournament-staple cards.<p>I&#x27;ve encountered a few people in tournaments with counterfeit cards who had no idea until confronted about it. But to me, they stick out pretty obviously, and to the vendors -- who handle thousands of cards each day -- they&#x27;re instantly recognizable. And that&#x27;s taking into account the fact that there have historically been pretty wide variations in the quality of the genuine print runs.<p>Short of &quot;handle a lot of cards to get a feel for how they should be&quot;, though, I don&#x27;t know what to tell people who come to me worried about accidentally buying counterfeits.",1428141591

That&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d consider new (or interesting).<p>What is more interesting, though, is what kind of probability distribution it follows. From that, it is straightforward to figure out other representations (as the sorted plot by the author). But it&#x27;s kinda annoying to figure that out from that plot in reverse since I&#x27;d need to calculate cumulative distribution functions.<p>From what other&#x27;s have posted the log-function fit means the probability distribution is exponential (since the cumulative distribution function is exponential). I wouldn&#x27;t know, maybe a Gaussian is a better fit, exponential seems unnatural, but I&#x27;d need to sit down and compute error functions in order to figure that out from that plot.<p>It would&#x27;ve been great if the author would have made the effort to exclude the obvious guess that the sickness probability distribution function is a Gaussian distribution.",1428141230

The F-22 was supposed to be the high performance, high end, high cost plane and the F-35 was going to be the high volume, low cost plane to fill in the numbers.  Just like the F-15/F-16 pair.

9320442,comment,9315914,9317451,0,0,mackram,,,"I have been in Beirut for many years now and I am sure that there will be many responses to this post that will be making alot of noise about how beirut has nothing so allow me to add the following:<p>1- I agree that Internet is quite problamatic for the country but it is not insurmountable with a bit of planning, but that means spending on energy on something you should not.<p>2- The companies mentioned (like most startups in the region) start out by copying business ideas and models from other places. That does not mean they are not working on some interesting things but the truth is most are not focused on this. Some companies that get no light are working on some really interesting things such as better power management, hydroponics, controllers for elevators, telecom infrastructure, bitcoin etc. These are few and in between but they do exist. Also I dont think focus on Arabic internationalization is an easy manner it might not be as difficult as saying chinese internalization (baidu anyone) but still.<p>Allow me to give my opinon on the problems of the community:<p>a- High Cost of living and few opportunities for second chances: Beirut is not a cheap city by any measure and the tech scene is very small (very few big companies) what this translates too is that talent of any kind (business or engineering) is reluctant to do startups where risk of failure is high since they are not sure they are able to pay the bills if it flunks and they cant land a job<p>b- Too small a market: Needless to say Lebanon and the region is a small market more importantly it is a small market of early adopters so it is very difficult to make a quick experimentation of the viability of ideas<p>c- Shortage of talent: It is no secret that most talent leaves the country mostly because salaries outside are way more then they can find in the country. Also the society is so small that anyone who stays is bound to know and be compared to someone of similar (or less) skill and making 5 times the salary and that tends to be emotionally tasking and propagates the cycle.<p>d- Lack in belief in quality from the region: There is a problem region wise where everyone seems convinced that anything coming from Europe, Japan and North America is of higher quality then things coming from the region. Accordingly all companies in the region without connection to outside are short-changed decreasing their chance of success.<p>e- Extreme selection bias: Everyone in the eco-system from VCs, Angels (the few that exist) and Enterpreneurs judge success and returns based on what is happening with the most successful silicon valley companies and therefore they demand same results claiming same hurdles. This is simply not true. The problems are different and they require a different solution.<p>Finally let me say Beirut is not ideal I know I have had (and continue to have) my crisis of faith in the matter but the potential does exist. We face similar problems to many upcoming tech communities and then some and we sure can achieve with more constructive discussions which hopefully such a discussion will start.",1428139821

325425,story,,,2,1,teuobk,"Ask HN: Is there a state-by-state guide to IP assignment issues that affect startups?",,"I've been talking with some friends about doing a startup, but there's a concern about the potential IP minefield we might be encounter.  In short, one of us has a contract with a software company that makes an extremely aggressive rights grab.  According to the contract, all work done by this person, even outside of work hours and without using any company resources, becomes the property of the company.  This seems like it might be overly broad, but I'm not a lawyer and I know that the law varies considerably from state to state.<p>Is there a resource somewhere online that discusses the issues in state IP/employment law for startups?  For example, I've heard that non-compete clauses are unenforceable in California, and a clause like that described above would be unenforceable in Minnesota.  Something like a table showing the differences would be great.<p>Alternatively, since the usual response is ""talk to a lawyer,"" can anybody recommend a competent yet affordable-enough-for-a-bootstrapped-startup attorney who could answer similar questions?  I'm particularly interested in the law for California, Minnesota, and New York.  Thanks!",1223333531

325419,comment,325380,325380,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This is not a startup...it's a small business.  Nothing wrong with that, of course.  A small business is awesome, and generally better for your finances and emotional well-being than working for someone else.  But, it doesn't have the same end result as a startup, and the way you build one successfully is very different.<p>I've done contract work for a few small businesses over the years, similar to the business you describe (though I charged more than Geek Squad, and provided somewhat higher end services...like Linux and UNIX administration, network infrastructure buildouts, etc.).  The yellow pages got me two jobs in the two years that I ran an ad (and a helluva lot of crazy people who wanted me to tell them how the government kept finding out what they were doing on their computer, or tell them how to find out what their spouse or child was doing on the computer, and for free).  So, that's a non-starter.  Advertising on Google AdWords, with very specific targeting might be the ticket.  It's how I found the dog walking and sitting service I use, and probably other services.<p>Check Craigslist for people looking for some work in your areas of expertise.  It'll be bigger projects, of course, but it'll help with word of mouth.  If you do a good job, it only takes a few customers to kickstart a good career as a contractor.  If you always plan to increase your rate and the complexity of services you offer, you can definitely get to $100-$150k/year in a few years, at which point, you can either start hiring other techs and build your own Geek Squad (maybe even turning it into a startup!), or just keep working, and tucking away 20% each year.  I know several folks who retired in their early fifties on this plan, and with a couple million in the bank (I inherited a few of their clients).<p>Personally, I found the work...ummm...frustrating, and draining, and far more stressful than I was comfortable with.  I was really good at it, and I kept cranking up my rate until I was making $150/hour, and clients were happy to pay it.  But, it just wasn't my bag.  You won't know until you try, though.",1223332957

325402,comment,324679,325300,0,0,lief79,,,"True to a point and possibly for the majority of jobs, provided that you aren't trying to bill yourself as a consultant (expert in whatever technology). I'm also assuming that the ""average hacker"" implies that you are eliminating everyone who claims to be one, but is not even close from the list of hackers, in order to greatly improve the average. (The average ""successful"" hacker.)<p>Now, even with the higher standard, the learning curve depends greatly on the complexity of the system and how much of a learning curve is permitted by the employer.  If you are trying to work with a full J2EE system, and you haven't done it before, expect a steep 2-3 month learning curve, even if you are proficient in java. If they need someone to be productive within that first week, the average hacker won't be able to make it.<p>There is just too much complexity and too many libraries to memorize in less time then that.  I spent a good month or two learning the EJB 2.2 frameworks, Servlets, JSPs, javascript, etc at my last job.  This job had a very steep 1 month learning curve with a modern Seam, Richfaces, JSF environment. I'd add on another month or two for anyone that doesn't already understand the core of the j2EE/web application stack.  This small team has had people that haven't been able to pull it off.<p>Now for the extreme example, my father has worked developing the base station for a satellite telephone system.  He's commented on how half of the people brought in to help him got lost in the complexity and provided next to no additional productivity.<p>I've also dabbled in pharmaceutical automation and in the telecommunication networks.  Very steep learning curves in regulations and the complexities associated in both fields.<p>In summary, competence often requires a lot more then just raw coding ability. Very few people can slide into a job under the radar and properly complete very hard problems where they don't have the expected domain knowledge.<p>*Reviewing this, it's not really a direct response to what was said in the above thread.

But blaming individual actors for systemic failure is no better than blaming your loan officer for the economic meltdown.<p>Note that critiques of education follow two lines:<p>1. You don't get enough for your first job (e.g. real-life skills --- such as C++/Java).<p>2. You don't get enough for the rest of your life (e.g. critical thinking).<p>A cute dichotomy, but unsatisfying.  Frankly what I don't like about all this is the static ""learn"" phase followed by the static ""work"" phase.  I grew up working while in school (not the heroic part-time school, part-time student way, just the lazy ""I need RAM money, time for a summer gig"" method).  I like the idea, and it's made me a better student and a better professional programmer.<p>What gets me is little incentive I see for people to alternate between school & work.  Either you work 12 hrs a day (8 for work, 4 for school), or give up work (& salary) to go back.  Neither are good choices if you've got a spouse and kids.<p>Are there employers that give you a break on responsibilities (at least in hard time) to get an advanced degree?  The payoff in smarter employees seems pretty worthwhile.<p>It'd be better to make undergrad less of a make-or-break situation, and more of a path of work/learning that continues for the rest of your life.

Send your post to your co-founder. Try an forget about ""effort"" and ""sacrifice"". Is he adding value at all? Is he going to once you launch (i.e. sales or something?).<p>b) This sounds to me like a theory/reality problem. I love thinking up ideas and plans. I hate when they get all messy when I try and bring them into the real world. It sounds like you might be interested in the ""new development"" work and have tired of your less-than-perfect implementation. Once you launch, is there a chance you'll get more funding, another customer to help with funding or anything?<p>Also, you might try and separate your feelings about the work and the actual changes of the business. Just because you hate it now doesn't mean it won't be successful (not that I'm advising you to do something you hate...).",1223330519

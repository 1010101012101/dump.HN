I think that a good university is one that promotes several spheres of self improvement - academic, athletic, artistic, and the like. As a university student myself, I would be disappointed with my school if it shunned athletics as a lesser endeavor. If a university can promote great academics while also fielding a winning football team, that shows real accomplishment.<p>A large university might have several hundred professors, but it only has one head football coach. Even if you consider a coaching staff (none of which individually make as much as the head coach), you're only talking about a dozen or two individuals at most. However, a university gains a lot more notoriety by having a winning football team than it does by having a well published professor. If you were in charge, who would you pay more? Don't answer before considering all the alumni that you have to keep happy if you want to keep your job.<p>Edit: Also consider that once a professor is tenured, it takes a lot for him/her to mess up and get fired. However, as soon as a football coach has a losing season, his future employment is up for reconsideration. The bigger paycheck also means a lot less job security.",1197313093

I suspect if you asked a hundred random people about ""Straight As"" a goodly number would feel weird reading it, or would actually mistake the meaning.  Conversely, ""Straight A's"" is only going to bother people who have memorized the rules.",1197311572

It takes a while longer to become adept with Ruby and start writing Ruby code like a pro.</i><p>I'm not talking about ""any smart Java developer,"" I'm talking about a top-quality hacker that really understands computers.  From a hiring perspective, it may be hard to tell the difference between a great hacker who solves big problems and a Ruby Pro who can only write effectively in Ruby.  But it's the truth.  A programmer who really understands the inner workings of a system and the point of high-level languages shouldn't have any problem learning to use Ruby effectively in a very short period of time with minimal coaching(No more coaching than you'd likely need to do anyway, if you're planning to actually integrate his code).<p>If you're trying to plan your own career, ""should I become a niche developer?"" is the wrong question to be asking, unless you have failed an attempt to become a great hacker and aren't interested in trying again.",1197310149

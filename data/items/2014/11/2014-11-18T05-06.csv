I rent ~10 virtual private servers outside China, and ping times vary between 90ms (&#x27;best&#x27; provider) to 500ms (&#x27;worst&#x27; provider).  Packet loss varies over time, but has never been an issue with > half of the providers.<p>> What I never understood with my self build SSH proxy VPN: China seems to be able to sniff on it.<p>Were you using an HTTP proxy (e.g. forwarding a local port to squid running on your VPS) or a SOCKS proxy (just using the SSH command to act as a socks proxy)?  If the latter, then your DNS queries would still be resolved locally (probably by your ISP&#x27;s DNS server and, even if using an external DNS server, subject to MITM).",1416290243

The only area where I consider such things harmful is where opinions effect things they should not, and objectivity is not used in the right places.  What you are &quot;free&quot; to say, and what you should say in terms of being a good reporter are, of course, two different things. An example I&#x27;ve seen used a lot recently was where some reporter gave a pretty good game a low score because he thought it did not portray females strongly enough.  I don&#x27;t read game reviews to hear about political soap-boxing (even though I am pro-equality).<p>In the same way, I like to read about companies on the basis of their actions, or in the case of their official policies, their words - I&#x27;m sure many of us have made some comment that we look back on like &quot;what was I thinking?&quot; -- this sort of &quot;gossip&quot; reporting does not do it for me in that respect.  Again, I stress that even in light of this, the VP does not seem like a good person in my book, but I won&#x27;t let that effect my view of the rest of the company (Uber is doing a pretty good job of hurting its own image regardless ;) )",1416290178

8622579,comment,8622403,8622516,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"In my opinion someone in such a high up role in a high profile company like Uber who have had their fair share of bad publicity and controversies should know better. Having worked for the White House as a senior advisor, Emil Michael of all people should know the importance of being careful what you say in public, whether it be on or off the record.<p>While it is possible what he said was taken out of context slightly, the fact anything was said along these lines paints the picture of someone who should not be in business. What company does NOT have bad things said about them? We all live in a free country where journalists are entitled to their opinions just as much as everyone else including Mr. Michael. But the harsh reality is people in positions of influence or power whether it be a company or political party do not have such luxury, such is the case for Emil.<p>Sure Emil&#x27;s views might not reflect Uber as a company, but because of his position, it comes back on the company. This is the kind of stuff that competitors of Uber can only dream of. Emil has made Uber look bad by association, in the eyes of the public, Uber might as well have released a press statement themselves with the same words.

Now, with Node.js and its relatively stable module system filling that isomorphic+maintainable gap, it&#x27;s unclear what GWT brings to the table unless you have reasons to use Java (like a team with a lot of expertise in it, or a legacy codebase, for instance).

Humans can scan a broad visual scene for salient components, focus on those while ignoring non-salient objects, and then organize their thoughts about what has been seen in such a way as to produce an extremely low dimensional description of the scene (a descriptive sentence.)<p>Human&#x27;s also have the advantage of immediate feedback to their generated descriptions from peers or parents.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen much work that has attempted to tackle datasets that aren&#x27;t pre-framed by humans, or ones that try to scale reinforcement learning.

Too many times I have been in a situation where I had no cash to tip an Uber driver who helped me carry heavy luggage or items because the app lacks a tip feature.<p>I am not one for jumping on bandwagons, but I really do not like the kind of leadership and image Uber are portraying, not to mention the questionable business practices that were revealed a little while ago.<p>The power of choice is the strongest message we can send Uber that they need to grow up and be a real business.

Till now, I can see people playing it in subway all the time. I talked about this game in one of my social media timeline. One of my friends, my second startup&#x27;s partner replied me. He told me their team created 1024, father of 2048. &quot;Awesome!&quot; isn&#x27;t it? But this guy, Lans, didn&#x27;t sound happy about the fact.<p>After some chat, I realized that they made this 1024 game from the idea of the game Threes, and the 2048 was created by a student who found 1024 interesting. However Lans&#x27; intention wasn&#x27;t really for popularity or money, he is a serious dreamer. At that time, he and his partner Yop&#x27;s young team was just founded, they wanted to build something elegant and fun. Lans likes the Threes, but it is not an easy game according to him, so he and Yop redesigned the game into 1024. They are a Chinese based team, HN isn&#x27;t a language-friendly site for them. That&#x27;s why when I suggested him to talk about it in HN, he said &quot;it&#x27;s fine, we can make something better anyway&quot;. Another thing made them upset was, I guess, some media or people think they were copycats. I just want say, do not overlook the work of simplifying and redesign, The addiction of 1024 or 2048 comes with reasons.<p>Today, Lans contacted me again, he told me that they just made another game, a better one. He wanted me to try it out and give some feedback. I tried, and again, I like it.<p>I think it is worth sharing, and I also want to help Lans and his team Veewo. Their efforts deserve to be acknowledged and encouraged. Hope you guys also enjoy this new game :)",1416289160

So if you knew that a student was going to do the whole thing, you could do more just-in-time teaching - but if you didn&#x27;t know, then it&#x27;d be doing a disservice to the snacker to leave out something like Big O notation, because it&#x27;d sure be strange if someone learned Theta and Omega and came away not knowing that last one existed. We did spend a while restructuring asymptotic notation in particular,  that was one of the topics we debated different approaches to.<p>We also debated the use cases for recursion, and if we should include the classic factorial challenge.

I&#x27;m young, as you&#x27;ve pointed out, and I&#x27;ve never worked for Google, but I&#x27;d bet that this decision wasn&#x27;t made lightly, and it certainly wasn&#x27;t made early in the lifetime of clang/LLVM.<p>The people truly at fault for the things I fear, should they come to pass at all, are not the late adopters like Google, but the innovators who decided to put their energy into LLVM, knowing full well how dangerous it could be.<p>I don&#x27;t and didn&#x27;t mean to imply that Google is going to stop contributing, or that Google never has.<p>I do think that Google&#x27;s decisions to contribute upstream are based on business sense, as opposed to morality, and I think that should the day come that it makes business sense for Google to not contribute back, or to release a non-free fork, it&#x27;ll do that. As others in this subthread have pointed out, Apple has already distributed non-free LLVM modules.<p>The concern I have is that this is <i>possible</i> with LLVM, and it was not possible with GCC. When Apple wrote a non-free Objective-C frontend for GCC, they liberated it because the Free Software Foundation successfully enforced the GPL. There is no legal mechanism to <i>force</i> corporations to contribute back to LLVM, so they do it of their own goodwill, if they do it at all.<p>I think this is dangerous because it <i>can</i> lead to a world where there are no good free compilers. The people who wrote LLVM, the people who championed it early on and contributed to it, they could have realized this too, and they did nothing to stop it. I truly hope they acted the way they did because I am egregiously wrong, and that nothing I&#x27;m afraid of will ever happen.<p>To put things in perspective, GCC had one fork in its history already. I think that if it was forked again, redesigned extensively to make it easier to get parse trees and add modules and so on, with the legal requirement that all such modules be free in any distributed compiler, the FSF would eventually, hopefully, accept that as the canonical GCC. It would have been harder to do that than to make LLVM, maybe it would have cost the world a few years of compilers research, but it would have been possible, and it would have made for a more secure outcome.",1416287661

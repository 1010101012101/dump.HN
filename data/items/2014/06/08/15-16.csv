7864990,comment,7864537,7864688,8,0,srean,,,"I am actually _very_ puzzled by by this comment because its the polar opposite of a point of view that I would have expected. In fact I can think of very few datamining and machine learning algorithms where linear algebra does not play a role.<p>Representing features of a datapoint as a vector, pervades and populates every pore of this field. Without an understanding of linear algebra you wouldn&#x27;t have support vector machines, no kernel methods, no neural networks, no perceptrons, no gradient descent methods, no Newton / Quasi-Newton methods, no multi-dimensional (or as they say in statistics, multivariate) Gaussian random variables, no matrix factorization, no Pagerank, no Markov chains, this list can go on and on.<p>Take the simplest of data science problems: you have one variable x and another variable y and you want to predict the value of y given x. Usually x is not a single scalar but n scalars (called a feature vector). Simplest thing you can do here is least squares and that is as linear algebraic as you can get. There many fancy ways of dealing with this problem but almost always it is reduced to solving a related linear system.<p>The bottom line is this: we understand very few things. Thankfully linear algebra is one of the few things that we do understand, so almost every analytical problem is reduced to this case (if, but locally) and then solved.<p>I would be very curious to know how you have been able to avoid linear algebra. It will give me a new and valuable perspective, because apart from &quot;click button, didnt work? ok click the next button&quot; data analysis I find it hard how one can do much data analysis without it. So please break my bubble, I will be thankful for it.<p>Canned packages often do not work out of the box. The knowledge of linear comes very handy in analyzing and debugging why is the model not working&quot; &quot;oh I see this matrix is near singular, thats why my estimates are off the park&quot;, or &quot;oh these two variables are very correlated, that is why gradient descent is having so much trouble converging fast&quot;, &quot;ah I see why I am getting NaN here&quot; etc etc.<p>EDIT: darkxanthos, appreciate your comment. I would say it is a bit like driving. Knowing the internal mechanics is neither necessary nor sufficient, and hardly correlated with good driving skills when things are going well. But sometimes when things are not going as expected, it helps in debugging.<p>Let me try and pique your interest: Note that the decision boundary of naive Bayes is actually a linear function of the log conditional probabilities considered all independent, with LA you can now also consider the case that they have dependence. Consider updating multi-armed bandit problems, the updates are variants of gradient descent, and its nature is indeed characterized by the eigenvalues of Hessian of the thing you want to optimize. Consider K-means clustering, one way to get very close to its global optimum is to solve the same cost function using linear algebraic updates (called spectral graph partitioning). By trig I think you have the dot-product of two vectors in mind, the related analysis actually does not rely much on trigonometric properties but heavily on the linear algebraic properties, in fact this what allows one to escalate affairs from simple linear feature vectors to extremely non-linear ones because even though they are nonlinear in the data space in some other space they are linear so people do the math in that space (called the kernel trick although I find that term quite silly) ..This thing, linear algebra, lurks everywhere, I tell you :)",1402243192

Zapping sleeping volunteers at this frequency, part of the so-called gamma wave band, led their brains to produce brain waves of the same frequency, the researchers found, which triggered lucidity 77 percent of the time, as determined by self-reports from the dreamers after they were awoken.<p>>Now if we look to see the scores they gave for how much dream insight, dissociation and control they had, we find that the averages for the gamma stimulation condition are around 0.6, 1.3, and 0.5 respectively.<p>I don&#x27;t understand. A score of 0.6 for insight means, at best, 40% strongly disagreed that they knew they were dreaming and 60% perhaps <i>moderately disagreed</i> (score=1). Some higher scores for the successes would result in even more than 40% <i>strongly disagreeing</i> that they knew they were awake. I could see it having an effect for a small number of people, but how does that translate into &quot;triggered lucidity 77 percent of the time.&quot;",1402242968

7864959,comment,7864525,7864525,17,0,charlieirish,,,"I was talking to my father about this topic last week. We talked about the best strategies for combating procrastination. He used to be in the British Army and suggested that a militaristic approach has always worked for him. He talked about the button polishing, the bed sheet folding and the shirt starching. These were tasks that were set by the commanding officers and needed to be performed flawlessly.  They weren&#x27;t pleasurable, they were boring and often felt unnecessary. Failing these tasks meant severe punishment and potentially being kicked out of the army.<p>This gave him a framework for success. The knowledge that however boring something is, it <i>needs</i> to be done. A combination of a carrot and a stick can help this process.<p>Another approach, from a member of a mastermind group that I attend, has a &#x27;dull day&#x27;. On Monday of every week he does all the administrative work that he hates. This includes dealing with expenses, filing, bug fixing, documenting etc. He has been doing it for months and loves the fact that he can start the day on Tuesday with a clear head and clear conscience.<p>So, breaking this down (from my admittedly small sample set):<p>- Be Strict -<p>Be strict with yourself and use incentives or disincentives.

Remember when man first tried to fly, most devices mimicked birds and failed horribly. The other school of thought believes that intelligence has well-defined principles, when discovered, would produce real intelligence (not mimicry), having the effect that the final product may not resemble what we see on day to day basis. Compare planes, which use the principles of flight, to the early flapping machines. A bird and plane both fly but they are very different in the way they do it. Approaching flight from the mimicry angle is hard, it&#x27;s only recently in the last 10 years we have made light-weight flapping machines that fly well;yet we have had planes for over a hundred years once we knew the principles.<p>Transcripts would be handy.

As usual, he wanders far afield in trying to find the roots of the problem, digging up what probably was a huge moment for him personally -- the academic opposition to Reagan -- but wasn&#x27;t really that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. (It worries me that people seem to understand why the surveillance state is bad, but immediately after acknowledging it, go back to their usual boogey men and political arguments they had before they figured this out, but that&#x27;s a discussion for another day.)<p>Three things here are mention of further note. First, the enemy here is the population of the western democracies themselves. Because terrorists blend and mingle with everybody else, they have no uniform or base and everybody must be suspect. Second, not only is this a huge grab for information, it&#x27;s also being done in secret. So the folks doing this are determined for the public not to have a discussion about it happening. Third, and most importantly, this discussion is not about the NSA or the US. This is about the role of technology in our lives. If we allow the tech to track us, then it&#x27;s going to be abused. So it&#x27;s either no tracking or tracking and making everything public to everybody. I don&#x27;t see a middle ground.<p>On the final point, it&#x27;s a terrible injustice to the tragedy of what&#x27;s happening to continue to direct outrage at the NSA. The <i>NSA is the good guys</i>. Just imagine what some of the other intelligence agencies are up to. Or what a sufficiently corrupt executive could do working at a place like Google, Amazon, or Facebook.<p>So kudos to Chomsky for jumping on the badwagon. We&#x27;re happy to have him.

Immigrants from many West Indian and African countries, such as Jamaica, Ghana, and Haiti, are climbing America’s higher education ladder, but perhaps the most prominent are Nigerians. Nigerians make up less than 1 percent of the black population in the United States, yet in 2013 nearly one-quarter of the black students at Harvard Business School were of Nigerian ancestry; over a fourth of Nigerian-Americans have a graduate or professional degree, as compared with only about 11 percent of whites.&quot;<p>Same argument would deal with &#x27;discrimination&#x27; - as a black Nigerian is likely to experience same sort of discrimination as black American (probably more so as they&#x27;re also foreign).",1402239716

Your mind would start wandering to topics you haven&#x27;t let it.<p>Set as a goal that you&#x27;ll accomplish less every day, and with zero expectation about what to do with the free hours that open up. Just as you pressure yourself to do more, pressure yourself to do less.<p>Try doing nothing and suddenly your subconscious takes over. You discover thoughts you didn&#x27;t even know were brewing. The fundamental principle underneath is one of balance, and you can trigger it with constraint. Constrain yourself to do nothing and your subconscious will find a way to pull you to something you like. Limit yourself to less, and you start overflowing to a new direction.<p>Like other people said, you look like you are trying to suppress the fact that you don&#x27;t like what you are doing. The power of a drifting mind can be used positively just as much as it can be used negatively.<p><pre><code>  A writer told me &quot;I didn&#x27;t get anything done today&quot;.\n  Answer: try to do nothing. The best way to have only good\n  days is to not aim at getting anything done.\n\n  Actually almost everything I&#x27;ve written that has survived\n  was written when I didn&#x27;t try to get anything done.\n\n  - Nassim Taleb\n\n</code></pre>\nMake sure you give it enough time. You need at least 1.5-2hr blocks of time where you can shut off the world and play uninterrupted, and you also need to schedule such unstructured play lots of times. Don&#x27;t worry about feeling unproductive in the meantime. Worry more about noticing the pattern to your thoughts, and do that at the end of each block of time so you don&#x27;t feel pressured to be noticing.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear what you discover.",1402239609

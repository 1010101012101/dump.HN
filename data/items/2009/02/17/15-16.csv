Thank you Mr Jobs!",1234886397

I have NEVER received a reply.<p>My product is a browser based game that is very popular with the 4chan crowd. We already advertise on ED. It's as close to a perfect fit for their audience as anything I can think of.<p>On their previous ad network (I just learned about the new one), things were self serve, but every time I bought ads I was told there was a conflict and to try again.<p>They seem completely uninterested in doing business with us, or anyone. Maybe that's why the whole thing is failing from a financial perspective?",1234885924

Managers want hard rules, and programming is not amenable to this.<p>I've been writing an essay on this topic for a while which really reminds me of this video, and one of the main thrusts is that you can't just learn rules, and it targets the question of how do you develop the wisdom to program. It's not all that great and it's not done (mostly unposted). It's not stuff that would necessarily be news to anybody here, but it's been interesting writing it all out.<p>There's no substitute for trusting programmer judgment, and that <i>bothers</i> people.

To get that (with most mainstream carriers) you need a voice plan. The cheapest voice plans are $40/mo and offer a boatload of minutes already.<p>So yeah, the carriers might miss out on charging some overage fees, but they are still going to charge their $70+ a month either way.

794035,comment,793810,793975,0,0,lkrubner,,,"Regarding medical innovation.<p>Other fields also threaten people's lives. If you build a new kind of jet engine, which gets through testing but which then is responsible for a spectacular crash, then your product has killed a few hundred people. And yet, unless there was fraud in the documentation of the tests, there have not been criminal cases in the past. I worry that in the future there will be criminal cases. Again, the trend that I worry about is that what used to have been treated as a civil matter will, in the future, be treated as a criminal matter. We do not need to focus on the medical field. Many other fields can cause people to die - industrial automation, the transport and disposal of toxic chemicals, the construction of buildings (which could then fail and kill people). All industries are in need of innovation all of the time, yet innovation brings with it risk, including the risk of death. How much innovation will we get if we make these matters criminal?<p>I should emphasize, just in case people forget, that fraud has always been criminal. It has been criminal for centuries. So the move to criminalize more aspects of business is not a move to make fraud criminal. If you think that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act made fraud criminal, then you are mistaken. Fraud has always been criminal.<p>Sarbanes-Oxley is representative of the new trend. The overall goal was to encourage greater accuracy in the reporting of a company's financial health. This goal could have been reached through a variety of methods, including both the carrot (rewards) and the stick (punishments). Rewards could have included tax breaks for meeting some additional level of compliance. Punishments could have included fines levied against companies that failed to meet a higher level of compliance. These approaches would not have raised the risk of jail time for CEO's. Instead, Sarbanes-Oxley decided to go with the heaviest kind of punishment of all - to treat infractions as criminal offenses, potentially meriting jail time.<p>This punitive attitude is going to have a chilling effect on the amount of innovation we can expect in any field.",1251603935

With #try, there's similarly less code overall and it removes redundancy.<p>I agree that brevity alone is not enough to prefer one idiom over another. Expressiveness is a big part. I like these idioms, so I'm actually in the camp that they <i>do</i> make the code more precise and communicative.<p>In my book, though, #returning is simply an exception. A simple assignment and return are already so fundamentally expressive on their own, that — to me — replacing them with a method invocation and block doesn't get you more expressiveness, and instead it actually makes things less readable.<p>To me, it would be like writing an abstraction layer to replace the use of variables in the language, where you have to invoke a special-purpose lookup table class to set and retrieve values. Why would you prefer<p><pre><code>  Variable.set(:foo, 'bar')\n  puts(Variable.get(:foo))\n</code></pre>\nover<p><pre><code>  foo = 'bar'\n  puts(foo)\n</code></pre>\nWhy not just use variables?",1251603088

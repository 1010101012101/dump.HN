4917033,comment,4916629,4916909,21,0,akie,,,"You must be quite young. To me, what defines a good relationship (in terms of having a partner) is not necessarily that what you have in common with the other is a strong desire for stability, family life & kids. I've seen people get married because of this desire, and the people I've observed doing that don't necessarily seem very happy. On the contrary, actually. After a while they just become jaded. Like people in a job that they don't enjoy but that they need to do to pay the mortgage. I think these situations are quite unhealthy, and ultimately unsatisfying.<p>What defines a good relationship, in my opinion, is two people that know what they want out of life, that chase their own goals and have their own dreams, and then decide to do that together. It's much harder though, because sometimes these goals clash, but I wouldn't want it any other way.",1355421589

Attending alchoholics anonymous or narcotics anonymous (or a similar 12-step style program) can be a start, and it is really helpful if said person attends therapy with a professional of some form outside of those kinds of programs (church staff don't count, this absolutely should be a trained therapist, psychologist, etc).

BetaKit first covered Spoke when it launched the SPOKEnPHOTO iPhone app in June 2012, the first in a planned suite of voice-powered mobile apps. SPOKEnPHOTOs new iPad app lets users organize their photos into albums within the app, and use their built-in microphone to narrate each photo or record a message to loved ones.<p>In an interview with BetaKit, founder and CMO Lynne McEachern said that she and her co-fouunder created the app to stay in touch with long-distance friends and family. We felt that photo sharing wasnt quite meeting our needs. It was really hard to stay connected to our long-distance family and Skype is also hard to schedule across time zones, so we came up initially with the concept of the SPOKEnPHOTO Album iPad app for special events so that they can feel like theyre still part of them, said McEachern.",1355420872

4916949,comment,4915751,4916231,1,0,nickik,,,"> But the real reason that nobody pays too much attention to Hayek is that the way countries recovered from the Great Depression worked entirely counter to Hayek's predictions. Going off the gold standard worked. It worked really well for every country that tried it!<p>I would reconsider your argument here.
(1) Hayek was not a huge gold fan as it is, he changed his views on money changed over the years<p>(2) The gold standard that exist at the time is something very diffrent then that gold standard, gold advocates actually wanted<p>(3) The third and I think most importend one is that if you inflate on a gold standard, deflating back to that standard is like driving over somebody and then backing up over that person. The right solution would have been to stop prudction of money and see the new price of gold and then fix the doller to that standard again.<p>(4) Hayek is actually still very relevant and even mainstream. What we have to understand here it is perfectly possible to reject hayeks macro but not his micro, or the other way around. Hayek is infact very respected for his devlopment of information economics in particular.<p>> So now we have neo-Keyesianism as endorsed by people like Krugman and Monetarism from people like Friedman and they agree about a lot more stuff than Hayek and Keynes did.<p>Here you are assuming that austrians did not change since the the 50s.<p>Modern austrians macro in fact are really close to modern monetarist. There is infact wide agreement between Market Monetarist and Austrian Free Bankers. I would even clame that the are much closer together then neo-keynsians are.<p>I would also argue that mainstream economics now is much closer to austrian economics then it was 50 years ago. Things like Public Choice Theory, Law&Economics, New Institutional Econoimcs are all much closer to austrian economics then the are to standard neoclassical economimcs.<p>Austrians have been talking about the role of the entrepreneur for a long time, modern development economics only in the last decade started agree that it is importend, movment like micro finance are all things that spring from this.",1355420859

It's not that bad and could be tuned up quite easily.<p> The text shadows on the main page are a bit much. 1px offset is sufficient and the shadow color probably doesn't need to be so light.<p> Grey boxes around text are too tight and probably shouldn't be so rounded.<p> Headers on home-page are either too big or aren't given enough space. Whitespace! Don't be afraid to use it.<p> Darker shadows on headers have the same problem  too much offset  just looks tacky.<p> Title and description on homepage looks crammed into the top. Give it more space. Maybe smaller text.<p> Red headers are way too bright.

Maybe speed should be nonparametric, but that will introduce some new problems in estimation; maybe you know enough about physics to write down a parametric formula for speed; whatever, the exact details of speed(.,.) are kind of beside the point for the author's argument.<p>Now,<p>speed(gas_t, slope_t, parameters) - E_{t-1} speed(gas_t, slope_t, parameters) (eq2)<p>is a martingale difference sequence when ""parameters"" is set to their true value, so the sequence equals zero in expectation for all t, assuming the model is true, and that can be the basis for estimation through, say, Generalized Method of Moments.  Because combining (eq1) and (eq2) gives us<p>E speed(gas_t, slope_t, parameters) = const,<p>so you can estimate the parameters as<p>\hat parameters = argmin (average_over_t speed(gas_t, slope_t, parameters) - const)^2<p>Everything I laid out is an extreme simplification of the DOMINANT STRATEGY in applied macro (with, in all likelihood, some errors due to sloppiness).  Now, for any realistic economy, it's going to be hard as hell to write down a sensible formula for ""speed(.,.,.)"" and since there aren't that many years since WWII (which is kind of seen as the beginning of the ""modern"" economy) there isn't a lot of data to estimate the model, but neither of those issues have anything to do with the author's ""critique"" and are basically the direction of almost all research in macro.",1355419749

A feature I'd love to see is a map layer for mobile network coverage.  I'm taking a trip this weekend somewhere quite rural and would like to try out the turn-by-turn directions, and it would be good to know ahead of time if some cruicial point in the route simply isn't covered by a signal - you never know until it's too late!  They could perhaps combine this with the routing algorithm to offer you an alternate route where you don't have to make a turn in a no-reception area.

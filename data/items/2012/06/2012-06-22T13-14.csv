4146763,comment,4145179,4146508,18,0,psaintla,,,"I think there are two bigger issues:<p>1.) Things like this should not be warnings in the first place.  There should be more strict handling of invalid input so they result in actual exceptions being thrown instead of output that can be exploited in incorrect/undocumented ways.<p>2.) The php.net documentation for number_format doesn't even state that NULL is a possible output value.  And I can't find anything in the changelogs stating when this change was made (admittedly I glanced quickly so I may have missed it)<p>You state that it is a bug in PHP, but I respectfully disagree. This is a bug in the  varied way in which PHP returns output based on invalid input.  Some functions return 0, some functions return NULL, some functions return FALSE and it seems as if it is all done arbitrarily.  This really should end, invalid input should result in standard exceptions being thrown so they can be handled.",1340373536

Bring value and the opportunities to them, and you can often get into a teaming relationship with long-term benefits.  Alternately, team up with an 8(a) or service disabled veteran-owned company.  There are many program set-asides for those sorts of companies, so the barrier to entry in them winning government work is greatly reduced.  Same basic idea -- if you can bring them some skillset they lack and help them win deals, you're probably in a better position than running from agency to agency waving your GSA schedule.<p>I'm sorry the company that recommended their services to you was a scam.  There are several out there that offer seminars on the government procurement and capture management process that are very good.  I don't want to pimp the company I used or the seminars I went to (in no way affiliated), but the outcome was that as a small company (<20 engineers) we decided that our best current path (as far as selling into the government) is to keep subbing and let our primes (ie. our partners) do the selling and bring us in for the skillset we provide that they don't have.",1340373326

There are a whole lot of very different things called ""The Singularity"" and some of them are much more reasonable than others.<p>There's the Cambpellian Singularity, which says that we won't be able to predict what will happen next.  Pretty non-controversial as far as it goes.<p>There's the Vingean Singularity, which says that if we ever develop AIs that can think as fast and as well as humans then due to Moore's Law they'll be thinking twice as fast as humans after 2 years, so they'll start designing chips and the period of Moore's law will fall to 1 year, and so on with us reaching infinite computing power in finite time.  I think this vision is flawed.<p>Relatedly, there's the Intelligence Explosion Singularity (associated with Yudkowsky), which says that as soon as its AIs designing AIs, smarter AIs will relativly quickly be able to make even smarter AIs and we'll get a ""fwoosh"" effect, though not to infinity in finite time.  I find this unlikely, but can't rule it out.<p>There's one I don't have a handy name for, but lets call it the AI Revolution viewpoint, which is that AIs will cause civilization to switch to a faster mode of progress, just like the Agricultural Revolution and Industrial Revolution did.  This one will only look like a singularity in hindsight, and might seem gradual to the people living through it.  I think this one is pretty credible.<p>There's the Kurzweilian Singularity, where thanks to Accelerating Change we'll someday pass a point which will arbitrarily be called the Singularity.  As far as I can tell this is Kurzweil appropriating the hot word of the moment for his ideas a la Javascript.<p>Then there's the Naive Singularity, which equates processing power with intelligence and then concludes that computers must be getting smarter.  This is indeed totally naive and not something we should worry about.  I guess the linked paper is evidence that you can substitute a faster computer for smarter AI researchers to some extent, but probably not a very large one.",1340372939

Comcast said to the court they discussed payment terms with Duffy (Prenda's main counsel) and resolved their differences.<p>I do not know if Prenda ever ended up paying Comcast, but Comcast's refusal to comply to me seem more rooted in the costs to their legal department than to protecting their customers.<p>Comcast had no problem giving out thousands of customer's information for two years to these black mailers until recently. The merits of the case have never changed. They sue people in favorable jurisdictions and only Comcast could have stepped forward with the contact information and fought that with real evidence.<p>Kudos to Comcast, but don't consider them for sainthood yet.",1340372546

The reason they used 200x200 px images, I think, was that bigger images couldn't be analysed in sufficient quantity.<p>In a way their first input processing of the real images was pixelisation filter. If you feed pixelised image to a person you see how much information is lost. If you make single pixels occupy significant portion of view person might loose ability to recognize the image at all. Feeding so little information to CV system is like trying to teach nearly blind man to see.<p>To improve CV we should focus on finding best ways of converting full resolution visual data to something of smaller volume in such way that important features are preserved.
This input data IMO should also include time. I, thanks to crappy eyesight often recognize people, actions, objects relying more on how they move not how they look to me. Even with sharp eysight sometime your vision just gets stuck and can't recognize what is in the scene you are currently looking at.

Their purpose was to improve their ratings prediction algorithm, under the pretext that people frequently ran out of ideas of what to rent, and that a successful suggestion algorithm would keep people as customers longer after that point.<p>So, they carefully defined the success rate of their algorithm - that is, make it predict some set of actually-rated movies X on a 1-5 half-integer scale, take the arithmetic mean of (the sum of (the square of each error from the real rating)) - which we'll call root mean square error, or RMSE - and you have your ""score,"" where towards zero is perfect.<p>Their predictor had a score of I think 0.973 something (it's been years, don't quote me on that.)  Their challenge was simple.<p>Beat their score by ten percent, and you trigger a one month end-of-game.  At the end of that month, whoever's best wins le prize.  One million dollars, obligatory Doctor Evil finger and all.<p>Netflix provided (anonymized) a little over 100 million actual ratings, where all you had was a userID, a movieID, a real rating, and separately, a mapping ""this movieID is this title.""  You were only allowed to use datasets in your solution that were freely available to everybody, and you had to reveal them and write a paper about your strategy within one month after you accept le prize, honh honh honh.<p>Seriously, it was awesome.  They were going to do a second one, but lawyers, and the world sadded.<p>So, there, you've got a ten times larger dataset.  So surely sixteen thousand cores is the drastic thing, right?<p>Well, not really.  I was running my solution on 32 Teslas, which in the day were $340 in bulk and had 480 cores each.  So I actually ""only"" had 15,360 cores, which falls a whopping four percent short of Google's approach, which several years ago cost me about the price of a recently used car, and which I was able to resell afterwards as used, but without the bulk discount, for almost exactly what I paid for them in the first place.<p>Swish.<p>And I mean, I've got to imagine that someone else chasing that million dollar prize who thought they were going to get it invested more than I did.

Meaning if you launch and have 3 users, it'll be cheap to host because you can allocate very little memory, but as your userbase ramps up, you can turn the memory up with it.   Scaling is fairly prescriptive as well -- you either add more workers / nodes or more memory (or both).  Either way, if you don't need to scale, it's pretty cheap to stay small (less than $10 a month I'd suppose, but that depends on what you're building).<p>The only big negative I can think of as it pertains to you is that their Dotcloud on Windows support may not be great as they self-confess that none of them uses Windows.  I also don't, and I haven't tried to use it on Windows, but at least on Linux/OSX, development couldn't be easier.  It integrates with Git and is highly scriptable.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://dotcloud.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dotcloud.com/</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://heroku.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heroku.com/</a>",1340371225

And it's not hard to just hold down the hash key until it's reached the end of the line. But it's far quicker and more reliable in vim:
80i#<ESC><p>Say I'm editing code near the bottom of a screenful of text. I want to see a couple of lines that are just off the top of the screen. In most editors you'd hold down the ""up"" key until your cursor reached the top of the page, keep going until the lines you wanted were on show, then hold ""down"" until you got back to where you started.<p>In vim, Ctrl-Y a couple of times and you're done, without losing your place - your cursor stays in the current position, on the current line.<p>The regex-capable search + find&replace is invaluable - Earlier today I had to generate >100 tests based on information spread through multiple spreadsheet tabs. This would have been hours of work doing point&click copy-pasting, it was done in a few minutes courtesy of a couple of regexes.<p>Moving blocks of code around when refactoring is effortless: di} to delete all the code in the current JS function and copy it to the buffer, move to where you want the code to be, 'p' to put it in its new home.<p>The ""snippets"" plugin giving TextMate-style functionality is very useful, a big plus for vim's ability to be programmed, which I also use extensively. For example, we often need to look at information stored by our web application in a database. We used to have to either access it via the DB or use the web app itself to display a poorly-formatted static text output. I created a Vim command that retrieves the data, orders it, formats it, syntax hilights it, and makes it far easier to navigate & search.<p>I've used IDEs, I've used other editors, and Vim is simply better than all of them. IDEs in particular spend more time getting in the way than they do being useful. Vim is the closest thing there is to being able to take the code I have in my head and dump it straight into a computer.<p>And given the number of studies that show that a single interruption to a coder can result in a half-hour delay whilst he rebuilds his mental stack, that makes Vim a tool that can save you hours of productive time every single week.",1340370577

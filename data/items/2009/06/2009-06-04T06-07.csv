The first essay is from him, and a classic known by all MMO developers. The next three are an academic essay by Bartle on virtual economies, and a two-part essay by Radu Privantu on the day-to-day practicalities. The last is also by Privantu, a ~5000 word post mortem on the genesis, growth and maturity of Eternal Lands, a simple but moderately successful fantasy MUD.<p>There's about a full day's worth of reading here (or two if you read it carefully), but it will pay for itself many times over if you are ever thinking seriously of starting or joining the dev team of an MMO.<p>Many of the lessons therein could easily be extrapolated to other online contexts, especially those built around a persistent social model.",1244098194

If you start a war, you must be ready to face the consequences, including using ground forces to supplement the air raids. NK can't send bombers to attack the U.S. but they can cross the border and engage U.S. forces in SK. This would have to be carefully thought out... I don't have the intel to assess whether an attack on NK would be effective or not, and fortunately I don't have the power to send thousands of kids in harm's way.",1244098162

641023,comment,640289,640463,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"Aircraft have floating, jettisonable radio beacons (Emergency Locator Transmitters) that transmit on the international guard frequency 121.5MHz (with intentional harmonic distortion that allow reception on the military guard frequency of 243MHz). That frequency is monitored by SARSAT (Search and Rescue Satellite) in North America -- the middle of the South Atlantic may not be monitored, since the automated search notifications would not necessarily reach anyone able to do much about it. Local air control stations will attempt to determine the position, but ultimately it's usually someone with a portable directional receiver that pinpoints the actual source of the signal. (Occasionally a unit will begin transmission due to mishandling or malfunction, and I spent far too much of my time in the air force trying to sort through ejection seat packs and spare ELTs to find an overambitious backup gone wrong.) ELTs are also normally located on any floatation rafts the aircraft may be carrying.<p>The aircraft itself will also carry an underwater acoustic beacon (pinging at about 40KHz) or two so that underwater wreckage can be located once the general area has been established by the ELT that should have been jettisoned on impact. Both items (the ELT and the UAB) have limited battery life -- they pump out huge signals relative to their size. By convention, the UAB is located in the same general area as the FDR and CVR longitudinally.<p>In the case of the Air France flight incident, it would seem that the ELT did not work or was at a significant distance from the crash site by the time the search reached the position. That the black boxes (the FDR and CVR) are expected to be recoverable at this point seems to indicate that the UAB did work (it would have been detected by a sonobuoy dropped by the search airplane, which looked to me like it was equipped with anti-submarine warfare equipment, judging by the MAD boom on the tail).",1244095400

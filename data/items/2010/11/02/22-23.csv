In addition, we were sued by a group of Buzz users and recently reached a settlement in this case.<p>The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about privacy online, the better their online experience will be.<p>Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail can file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at <a href=""http://www.BuzzClassAction.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.BuzzClassAction.com</a>.",1288738506

It seems that what you're asking for is actually slightly different than the linked blog post: that post is arguing for a stronger emphasis on software engineering, whereas you seem somewhat more interested in CS theory (they overlap, but different schools are stronger/weaker in different parts, partly because everything you really ought to know is >4 year curriculum, so schools have to pick a subset).<p>For example, Cal Poly is a very good school on the software-engineering side of the spectrum, with a heavy emphasis on C++ programming, OS/systems, software-engineering methods actually used in industry, etc. But it's not where you'd go if you were primarily interested in PLs theory, algorithms, etc.; the number of Haskell-expert or world-class computability-theory professors is much smaller than the number of world-class systems and software-eng professors.<p>For theory-heavy undergrad schools that are of high quality, one approximate metric is what proportion of graduates go on to get PhDs in CS, which indicates that the undergrad program successfully prepared people for that route. I believe Harvey Mudd is the highest on that metric, but Carnegie Mellon, Caltech, and probably a dozen other schools I'm blanking on also have well-regarded, theory-heavy undergrad programs.",1288738419

Let him develop as fast as he can while he is in his prime.

Read ""Outliers"" by Malcolm Gladwell. He has a few points that made me realize just how much it means to come from a good background, with parents that realize how their kid should be raised to become a independent and successful person.<p>3. Realize that your son will never become exactly what you wanted him to be. You can introduce him to the world of IT, and you can show him how it is fun to produce your own programs or web pages, but he has to take the choice to pursue an IT career by himself.",1288737743

In the above example discussion, I was claiming that if an extra 1000 people who wouldn't have voted went ahead and did vote, then, depending on how they voted, either their extra votes would make a difference, or they would not make a difference.  There is a possibility either way (even if the possibility of making a difference is smaller).<p>On those grounds, I do not see voting as a pointless, worthless activity; your vote added to the votes of others might be the deciding factor in who gets elected.<p>The bigger picture is, does it matter who gets elected? As you bring out in another thread, most of the major candidates ""opposing"" each other are actually very similar in what they stand for. Voting one in or the other probably won't make a huge difference. I guess if you want to claim that no matter if we vote or not, the government isn't going to be much different, that's probably fair.<p>To make more of an impact than voting, citizens may need to get involved as candidates and really try to change things, but in order for that to work, people would need to vote for them, which means, people would need to vote, rather than not vote.<p>So I guess, to be clear, I claim that your vote, along with the votes of others, can effect the outcome of the election. The outcome of the election may or may not effect the outcome of the government, but that's another matter entirely.<p>I for one am open to hearing suggestions on what we can do to improve the government beyond voting, or running for office (success at which requires people to vote).",1288737508

It seems the code that deals with paddle collisions only imagines horizontal collisions, so, every frame (or whatever unit of time it uses), it registers a collision and reverses its horizontal direction.

You rack up a lot of collisions very quickly like this.<p>This works much better on the left side, for whatever reason.  I've succeeded twice in getting the ball to vibrate on the paddle while moving slow enough vertically that I can follow it and prevent it falling off.  I haven't managed to do it on the right side; I have gotten it to vibrate, but only for a short time before it gets flung away.<p>Also, sometimes the ball vibrates on the top or bottom surface for a little while (fraction of a second).

(The article mentions that)<p>But I don&#x27;t fully understand why so many smart people, including non-believers, can&#x27;t see the obvious: that determinism has nothing to do with free will. Free will is just a mechanism of finding a path between the set of natural forces operating inside our mind, including all the range of motivations, from basic instincts to sublimated aspirations.<p>The opposite to freedom is slavery, either from external circumstances or from own instincts that, in turn, is caused by external circumstances: arrested development, physiological defects or the mental illness.<p>So lack of freedom has causes and freedom has causes too (configuration of our brain and a favorable environment). The opposite of freedom is not &quot;uncaused&quot;.<p>Requiring no determinism is one more example of the not true scottman fallacy. Or moving goal posts.",1445327861

10417959,comment,10417697,10417863,0,0,Natsu,,,"That depends on exactly what idea of determinism you have.  If you mean something like phenomena can be described by the standard model, that&#x27;s fine, but if it&#x27;s something like local realism, that&#x27;s been busted pretty hard.  This might prove more interesting than the linked article, though it was on HN previously:<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/full/409791a0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/full/409791a...</a><p>Local realism is the idea that objects have definite properties whether or not they are measured, and that measurements of these properties are not affected by events taking place sufficiently far away1.<p>[...]<p>Many experiments1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 have since been done that are consistent with quantum mechanics and inconsistent with local realism. But these conclusions remain the subject of considerable interest and debate, and experiments are still being refined to overcome ‘loopholes’ that might allow a local realistic interpretation. Here we have measured correlations in the classical properties of massive entangled particles (9Be+ ions): these correlations violate a form of Bell&#x27;s inequality. Our measured value of the appropriate Bell&#x27;s ‘signal’ is 2.25 ± 0.03, whereas a value of 2 is the maximum allowed by local realistic theories of nature. In contrast to previous measurements with massive particles, this violation of Bell&#x27;s inequality was obtained by use of a complete set of measurements. Moreover, the high detection efficiency of our apparatus eliminates the so-called ‘detection’ loophole.",1445327767

What if Windows phones gets a 99% market share next year? That&#x27;s 99% of users who will never be able to play Hogarth&#x27;s game because it was never ported. Even if we put aside proactive adaption, there&#x27;s also an issue of the code stagnating in relation to its environment. Entire architectures might change such as Apple&#x27;s move from PowerPC to Intel, or requirements might get tighter like sandboxing in the app store or the recent SPI mechanism that protects system files. Sure you might have emulators but that mostly relegates the software for later generations with more powerful hardware; to be played with nostalgia rather than in the moment.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, but we definitely need to do something to preserve these kinds of things for the future, like how the Internet Archive is breathing new life into MS-DOS games using in-browser emulation. [0] For one thing we need to preserve the binaries of games like these in case they do go down, and related to that, the specific software versions they ran on. (I&#x27;m contradicting myself here because these are the only non-radical approaches I see right now as opposed to something like a reserve for source code to be released when it enters the public domain).<p>[0]: <a href=""https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games</a>",1445324605

10417824,story,,,1,0,josephpmay,"Ask HN: Ethics of Social Hacking",,"For years, the Y Combinator application included the question, &quot;Please tell us about the time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.&quot; I noticed that that question has recently been removed.<p>I&#x27;m in a situation that&#x27;s making me wonder about the ethics of non-technical hacking. Tomorrow there&#x27;s a conference very near where I live that costs thousands of dollars to attend. The CEO of my main competitor is giving a talk at that conference, and a number of people who it would be advantageous for me to network with will also be there. Sneaking in would be relatively trivial, as the conference is in a semi-public location. I may not be able to get into the talks without a badge, but if I dress the part I&#x27;d probably be able to network during lunch and breaks.<p>On one hand, sneaking into the conference would be a major opportunity for my startup, and it could really give us a leg-up. The startup community always stresses hustling and doing things that don&#x27;t scale, and this would be the epitome of that. I checked with my state&#x27;s legal code, and I could only be charged with trespassing if I damaged property or refused to leave.<p>On the other hand, sneaking in just feels wrong. The people there spent thousands to attend, and it&#x27;s exclusive for a reason. I also have a relatively strong network, so it&#x27;s not like going would be make-or-break for me (if it was, the moral transgression would arguably be more excusable). Finally, some really high-profile people are going to be there, so if I get caught chances are I could be arrested even if there&#x27;s nothing I could be charged with.<p>My cofounder doesn&#x27;t want me to go, so I&#x27;ll probably listen to him, but I&#x27;d like to hear what HN&#x27;s opinion on this is.",1445324493

(Nowadays I run with my child in a jogging stroller, so I don&#x27;t need a backpack, and it&#x27;s a hilly 8km one way so I don&#x27;t do it every day.)<p>Now I always wore a backpack with a chest strap like you said, and I never had a harder time breathing than normally. It wasn&#x27;t a giant pain. And I didn&#x27;t have problems with getting the things inside the backpack sweaty. For reference, this is a 13 liter standard cheap daytrip backpack. If you want to get fancy, Salomon do a vest-like backpack that has a good rep in ultrarunner crowd, with literally no bounce whatsoever.<p>My experience with headlamps is more limited, but have you tried the type with the battery pack not on your head? The key to reducing bounce is reducing sprung weight.",1445324433

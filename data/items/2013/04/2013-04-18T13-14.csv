I learned Makefiles, C, C++, and Python so I could build, understand, and modify programs like curfloo, curphoo, zinc, and gchat+/gyach. Although I moved on to IRC, I'll never forget when someone passed me ""Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit"" (and the implicit link to Phrack) or the first time a bot I created logged in and took drink orders. The pride the first time I wrote a patch for my client to handle a login change all by myself.<p>A lifetime later, I know I wouldn't be where I am as a programmer if not for the encouragement of friends (some of whom I still talk with and do business with) I made as a teenager on yahoo chat. A lot of people I know grew up on IRC, but Yahoo Chat was my first love. Good bye, I'll miss you!",1366293547

I've enjoyed it though, and I wouldn't recommend against it.<p>Several issues:<p>the buildout process is long and monolithic and not conducive to minor adjustments.  I'm using ansible now and its much better for just changing one setting on an nginx config file or settings file and reloading.  I chatted with the author of buildout and he said he was building to an rpm and then mounting that as his means to do a live deploy.<p>I often wished I had virtualenv, so many things work well with it. for instance python-vim and sublime lint / rope like to have a virtualenv to get the python paths.  also ctags is happier if I can just enter the virtualenv and run it.<p>there may be a recipe for that but I never found one that worked nicely.",1366293473

5570597,comment,5569535,5570218,6,0,pivo,,,"I've had only one project in Scala and in general I really liked the language. My biggest reservation about Scala though is what I consider the over-DSLy-ness of some of the Scala libraries (3rd party libraries).<p>In my project different source files using different libraries could almost look like different languages due to the DSLs of the libraries those source files used. Maybe it's just my lack of experience with Scala, but I dislied this because I thought it reduced readability.<p>Even worse is when two or more DSLs in use in the same source file conflict, for example, with their implicits. Then you may be stuck with different source files using the same library but with different syntax, one with the DSL syntax (where there were no conflicts) and one without.<p>I suppose this is something you get used to with Scala, but I wonder if you've run into this and if so, what your reaction to it is?",1366293452

The app my team and I have been developing is an HTML5/Native hybrid app, much like LinkedIn's was, and their decision to move away from their HTML5 strategy is a bit baffling to me given how well things have worked out for us.<p>Our app has a few native ui elements like the top bar, the bottom tabs bar, a quick add control that slides in and out, and Facebook style drawers that expose two other webviews. The rest, however, is done in pure HTML/JS/CSS. Angular.js, in fact.<p>It runs well on old android devices with 2.2 installed, and runs really well on newer Androids and iOS devices. We take full advantage of the benefits HTML5 provides. Most of the user's important data is cached in localStorage so the app loads very quickly. We use websockets to update the app in realtime without the need to rely on long-polling or native push notifications (which we do still have). We have <i>one</i> stylesheet with <i>zero</i> platform specific hacks thanks to the fact that Android and iOS devices use webkit browsers. And laying out our app's interface in CSS/HTML is much more efficient than doing it <i>twice</i> either programmatically or using nib/xml layouts.<p>We even use <a href=""http://www.tidesdk.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tidesdk.org</a> for desktop native apps and of course that version runs fantastically. We didn't start out using Angular.js on our main web app, but we are slowly starting to transition our mobile app codebase over to our main web app codebase. At some point we will have the largely the same code running across all major offerings of our product.<p>Every time one of these splashy articles about a well known company moving away from HTML5 comes out I smile knowing that the FUD it will inevitably create will allow those of us who are benefiting immensely from using HTML5 for mobile to continue to enjoy our productivity advantage.<p>For those who are curious, our product is <a href=""http://kona.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kona.com</a> and the mobile apps are both available in the store.

Passwords are typically chosen by customers, changed (let's be honest) very rarely and on a haphazard schedule, often reused across a bunch of different systems no matter how frantically we wave our hands, and (most important of all) have ""user"" semantics and scope: a password lets a user log in and do logged-in-user stuff.<p>Whereas an API key can be issued by the system, and is thereby guaranteed (assuming a clueful programmer) to be long and random and unique and not shared with the customer's Gmail account and bank account. You can expire it often. You can issue more than one per customer. (With passwords, this is theoretically possible but practically impossible; customers barely understand how to handle <i>one</i> password.) You can issue it to entities that aren't themselves customers, and that don't have ""user"" semantics.  You can scope it to particular uses, issuing a key that is only good for checking balances but not for initiating transactions, for example.<p>---<p>[1] The other being cache coherency.

The emerging chart is actually quite good. I haven't heard of anyone on it but already heard a few good songs. The suggested chart (based on artists on you follow which the app finds automatically when you link your Twitter account) is also quite good. It's finding me tracks by artists I know but haven't heard in a while and a few new ones too.<p>The play interface is a bit clunky. I've already accidentally switched to the next track and there doesn't seem to be a way to seek so when I went back I had to start the previous track from the beginning again.<p>The app makes sharing what you're listening to pretty easy and includes a link to the track on the music service you've linked your account with (Spotify or Rdio).<p>Search is a bit funny. It says 'search for artists' but really just returns a list of twitter users matching your search term. I could see twitter introducing some sort of artist account. It can't be that hard to verify an artists authenticity through checking if they have music on Rdio, Spotify, or iTunes.<p>It seems like it could be a good service and is soemthing that will be useful to me immediately but they do have a few things (mainly the playback interface and search) to work out.<p>Edit: The website is now live: <a href=""https://music.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://music.twitter.com</a>",1366292006

If other means of killing are just as efficient, why protect your home with a gun? Why not use a machette or an axe?<p>And while we're on this subject, what's with the ban on federally funded research into a problem that's leading to so many deaths?

No gun shops in Chicago, therefore banning gun sales nationally can have no effect rates of gun ownership or violence. Maybe it's a sociological problem - oh, well that's all right then.

That means some kind of green tax - preferably something designed to be revenue neutral via equivalent cuts to, say, income tax.<p>The key is that it doesn't have to be ""energy prices"" but only ""unsustainable energy"" prices, i.e. fossil fuels. And then you have your method of making the tax revenue neutral: Tax fossil fuel, use the money to subsidize non-fossil energy. Result is that net energy prices don't rise by very much, but they shift away from fossil fuels and toward sustainable energy.<p>You can control how fast this happens just by adjusting the amount of the tax. And yes, imposing an immediate 10000% tax on oil would get people to stop using it very quickly indeed, but a somewhat more gradual phase out may be less disruptive -- a 50% tax, for example, with a promise to raise it even more as time passes to encourage people to buy electric cars and corporations to stop wasting money looking for new deposits of fossil fuels.",1366291305

It made a lot of sense, when viewed from his point of view.<p>Eastman was an energetic, engaging and vivacious young man who had been brought low by a series of illnesses -- including severe back problems such that he could hardly walk from room to room without pain.  That prevented him from going out and photographing, which was his lifelong passion.  His children were grown, and his company had succeeded past the point of needing him day to day.<p>His summary of the situation was a pretty good one.",1254250708

I will never know whether my experience would have been easily replicated, or how important the factors you cite are.  If anyone else tries something similar, I would be interested in hearing how it worked out for them.<p>That said, I was pushing students to use learning strategies that I have personally found to be incredibly valuable.  I firmly believe that it is a good thing to read ahead before class, pay close attention during class, ask questions promptly and follow a regular review schedule later.  This is both effective and takes surprisingly little time to do.<p>On a final note, I sympathize with your pain about not being rewarded for your teaching.  The academic system rewards professors for research, not teaching, and teaching suffers greatly for it.  <i>Why the Professor Can't Teach</i> is as relevant today as it was when it was 30 years ago.

EVERY MODERN OPERATING SYSTEM COMES BUNDLED WITH A BROWSER. Mac OS, Ubuntu, even the Palm Pre.<p>People like picking on MS because they believe in their heart of hearts that it was some evil on MS's part which led to IE becoming the dominant browser, but that is not so. At the crucial moment MS had the better browser (IE 4 vs. Netscape 4), I made the switch myself to IE when nobody else was using it because it was a better experience (I currently use chrome for the same reasons). At a time when Netscape was bloated, slow, unstable and had serious usability problems, IE was faster, more stable, and had a better UI. MS bundled their browser with their OS. And, even more importantly, Netscape went into a phase of directionless thrashing around. We know now that they rewrote their code base for NS 4 for no reason whatsoever. They continued to churn their code for several years with no noticeable improvements to the core browser functionality. People tend to forget that Netscape effectively died at the height of the browser wars. They screwed up so bad that they dumped the browser on the open source community, which spent several years cleaning up the code until it finally turned into a decent browser.<p>But by then Netscape's failure and MS's success had already cemented IE as the dominant browser, at the time.<p>But despite IE's bundling there is today again a healthy competition amongst browsers. Firefox has a sizable marketshare with chrome, safari, opera and others as viable alternatives. Solid proof that with a better browser it's possible to compete against bundled browsers.",1254250021

850963,comment,850786,850937,0,0,jazzychad,,,"Good question. Here are some reasons:<p>-Stream only tracks keyword tokens. TweetHook uses the Twitter Search query syntax.<p>- Using the stream requires a dedicated server with a dedicated TCP connection resource to consume and parse/handle the data. TweetHook only requires that you have a web server somewhere that can handle POST data. Also TweetHook supports multiple endpoints, whereas the Stream can only terminate in one location.<p>- Using the stream requires the consumer to multiplex the data and determine what keyword was matched when receiving data. TweetHook provides the actual query that was matched with the POSTed data. No multiplexing required.<p>- The Stream requires a good bit of technical knowhow to get it running correctly. TweetHook aims to make receiving search data easy and accessible to anyone who has a website and knows some scripting. A Wordpress plugin could be developed, for example, to receive and display tweets relevant to the blog's content. Tweets could then be loaded from a local cache instead of depending on fetching data from the Twitter servers using a javascript widget (which usually delays page loads).<p>- Currently the Stream and the Twitter Search data have different EULAs/TOS (this could change, of course).<p>This question is something I have thought quite a bit about as the Streaming API was launched after development on TweetHook had started. Currently I do not point out these differences on the website since I did not want to make it look like I was downplaying the Streaming API, which in itself is actually pretty cool.<p>Personally, I think that webhooks are more accessible to developers, and eventually to more tech savvy users like some bloggers. That's my $0.02 at least.<p>[edit] made some grammatical corrections",1254248502

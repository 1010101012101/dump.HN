6812408,comment,6811577,6811940,4,0,programminggeek,,,"Well that would totally do it. High failure rate on a low margin product is nearly as bad as having too much inventory because the effect is very much the same. Example:<p>Say you make $10 profit on a $100 product. For every replacement product, you need to sell 9 more to make your money back on the 1 failure. So, a 10% failure rate means you are basically selling the other 90% just to break even and try to stay in business.<p>I don&#x27;t know about OCZ&#x27;s margins or their failure rate, but with prices squeezing downward, I&#x27;d imagine they found themselves in a situation where they maybe had a high enough margin initially that the failure rate wasn&#x27;t high enough to sink them or the failures didn&#x27;t occur early enough to burn through the overall margin right away. That&#x27;s not a sustainable business and the only option is to get people to float you a loan that is maybe big enough to buy time to fix the quality problems if possible. In the event that it&#x27;s unfixable, no amount of money can save an upside down business model.",1385600314

Can this be true? Or am I looking at the situation too simplistically?<p>Regarding the topic at hand, do you believe that bitcoin&#x27;s low cost of transmission and features such as escrow and consignment lend the commodity-currency true value (like gold&#x27;s value being that you can wear it, use it for electrical equipment)? Or do you look at the protocol as having no intrinsic value (pure fiat)? -And do you think that that matters as a currency?<p>Many skeptics claim that a crypto currency backed by a mineral would be ideal, and that bitcoin&#x27;s only value is in it&#x27;s perceived worth. They also believe that this means it <i>could</i> be a big tulip party waiting to crash.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to believe regarding bitcoin&#x27;s future, as gold has had 4000+ years to earn it&#x27;s place in the world.

California is one of the most accountable governments in the world, but in the memory of its living residents has imposed both forced internment of its citizens by their ethnicity (WW2) and forced sterilization (until 1963).<p>What future crime or health scares could lead to the repurposing of this broadly-collected state data?

There are different definitions for different notions of security, but that does not mean there is <i>no</i> security definition.  It is also untrue to suggest that security parameters are fixed in practice; this is certainly false for public-key cryptography, but Rijndael was designed to support arbitrary parameters, as are many other practical block ciphers and hash functions.<p>&quot;Coming up with a good security definition is hard, the 2013 Turing award was given for one.&quot;<p>Not <i>one</i> definition, but several definitions and an entire <i>paradigm</i> for definitions.

Without a security definition, you cannot have any falsifiable claims about security.  If I claim a system without a definition is insecure, you can always refute me <i>by claiming that the system was never designed to defend against my attack</i> -- which is technically correct, because without a definition the system cannot be said to be designed to defend against <i>any</i> attacks.<p>Also, note that I did not say that Satoshi failed to give a <i>good</i> security definition for Bitcoin.

6812174,comment,6810543,6810543,7,0,bitops,,,"Disclaimer right up front: I personally doubt that Bitcoin will be a long-term success. I fall into the camp of people who believe it is not a mature enough technology, unproven despite the hype. It is much too volatile to be any good other than as a risky investment, though if you time it right, you could stand to make a fair profit at the moment.<p>What I do think is very interesting about Bitcoin is that it is a harbinger of things to come. It won&#x27;t replace greenbacks anytime soon, but I think it&#x27;s an indicator of where the world is heading.<p>I believe the global and historical trends we are seeing right now is away from traditional authorities acting as monoliths, in favor of empowered individuals. We are most likely at the very beginning of the trend - I doubt anyone reading this board in 2013 will be alive to see the transformation completed. But we will be alive to see some very interesting changes. Generally speaking, all centralized authorities, be they monetary, political, technological, etc. are fracturing in favor of empowered individual actors. That poses challenges as well as opportunities.<p>For example: consider a technology like Square coupled with a store of value such as Bitcoin. (In this example, the terms &quot;Square&quot; and &quot;Bitcoin&quot; are just placeholder values for mechanisms and tools). Oversimplifying greatly, if we take these technologies to their logical extreme, we have the tools for an individual to completely bypass banks and traditional governments. You have some goods that I want, I have some Bitcoins, we do a point-to-point transfer; you get the money, I get the donut, end of transaction. Truly savvy users in this system will have their own way of transmitting the money from themselves to the merchant. I&#x27;ll choose to trust someone like Square to do it safely and securely for a nominal fee.<p>Whether or not you agree with the mechanics of how this happens isn&#x27;t really the point. The point is to show that we are heading towards a future where two individuals can transact freely without a middleman &quot;getting in the way.&quot; For the purposes of this discussion, &quot;getting in the way&quot; means limiting the freedoms of those individuals to transact as they please.<p>Of course, there are problems with this. If there are no rules, inevitably someone will game the system or take advantage of someone else. That&#x27;ll be unpopular, and so people will seek to band together to transact in a network of trust. The idea of a network of trust is important today, it&#x27;s value will only increase over time. I can&#x27;t remember the exact term, but I read a wonderful book some years ago called &quot;Anarchy, State and Utopia&quot; which dealt with the philosophy around these types of issues (it&#x27;s a pretty academic book, but here&#x27;s a link in you&#x27;d like to see - <a href=\"http://amzn.to/18883MU\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://amzn.to/18883MU</a> - and yes, that&#x27;s a kickback link).<p>Boiling it down, the main argument I took away from that book was that, even in a world where there are no &quot;governments&quot; as we&#x27;re used to thinking about them, we&#x27;ll never achieve true 100% freedom because there&#x27;ll always be those who are stronger who take advantage of those weaker than themselves. For this reason, people join together and form mini-states. Within those mini-states and associations, rules will exist that people choose to live by, limiting individual freedom to provide security.<p>I think people are right to be excited about Bitcoin, but I&#x27;d be cautious about heralding any brave new world within the next 25 to 50 years.",1385597046

Our 8 Vertex 3 Max IOPS were in RAID 5 for a huge calculations which didn&#x27;t require reliability but wrote a lot of data and therfore we tried to save time with this experimental RAID. The RAID was fine for about a couple of month and seeing almost 3 GB/s throughput was mindblowing. But suddenly we we saw drives randomly failing. But the drives did not completly fail, we were able to rebuild the RAID with the same hard drive. We did that a couple of times until we thought it was too much hassle and used the drives somewhere else. Now we are buying Crucial M4s and they are totally fine. In the first place a hard drive must be reliable.",1385596943

I'm american and live in Europe, and being able to stay here legally was actually quite a hassle, so I have an inkling of what a problem it is for some people.<p>The practical problem though, as I said, was the large amount of people in a small amount of time that could potentially happen if you completely threw the borders open.  1 million people in India or China is a very small percentage of the population.  In a country like Denmark (just as an example), it would represent 20% of the population.  That's not likely to happen any time soon, but hopefully we will keep moving in that direction over time.",1193209831

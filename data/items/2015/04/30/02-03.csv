As to the rest, it&#x27;s not about the number of features, but the quality of implementation. HotSpot&#x27;s JIT and GCs are simply years ahead of the CLR, and HotSpot&#x27;s next-gen JIT, Graal, is another tremendous leap forward.<p>> The CLR is generally much faster to start up<p>Compared to HotSpot, yes (but, like you said, there are many JVMs out there), although Java 9&#x27;s JIT caching will change that.<p>> The library linking story is much more pleasant too, with a single dynamically linked executable referencing GAC-installed assemblies, rather than stringing together enormously long class paths.<p>This, too, is no longer the case in Java 9, but the difference in the other direction is much more relevant: the JVM&#x27;s agent capabilities (both Java and native agents) are one of the things that give the JVM its power. The ability to easily transform code as it&#x27;s loaded (or after its loaded) packs a lot of oomph.<p>In general I&#x27;d say that the JVM offers fewer abstractions, but more powerful ones and it offers less opportunities for hand-tuned optimizations and more for automatic optimizations. In the end, HotSpot is simply much more advanced internally. The CLR is like a car with more buttons, but HotSpot is the car with the better engine. HotSpot has always opted for constant change that&#x27;s hidden from the user, while the CLR has been adding more and more user-accessible features.<p>The work being done on Graal/Truffle is so far ahead of anything anyone else is doing, that it will put HotSpot&#x27;s JIT beyond the reach of any other technology for years to come. It seems to me that the CLR might even stop competing and C# might switch to AOT compilation, with VB possibly being abandoned. Some of the latest moves by MS seem to hint in that direction (RyuJIT was already done or nearly so).",1430360630

9462941,comment,9462374,9462374,0,0,ericabiz,,,"As an Airbnb host (we rent out our master bedroom suite), I can safely say Airbnb is not what it used to be.<p>It&#x27;s just like any community online, really. Airbnb started out as a tight-knit, mostly Bay-Area-techie demographic. As a host in Austin, where many techies visit, do job interviews, or hang out for a few weeks, I enjoyed meeting interesting people who were in the same (or similar) community as I was--startups/entrepreneurs. I met people who had shared connections with me on Facebook and people who became good friends.<p>Fortunately for Airbnb&#x27;s valuation, but unfortunately for hosts, the demographic has dramatically changed over the past few months to a year. With Airbnb becoming a &quot;household name&quot; of sorts, with a multi-billion-dollar valuation, people have started booking on Airbnb who are not of the caliber (to put it nicely) of the original close-knit community that made the site so neat.<p>I get it. Communities, as they grow and become mainstream, tend to attract more not-so-great people. It&#x27;s inevitable. It&#x27;s just, as a host, it stinks. Airbnb is going to have to get even better with quality control. (One step, as I&#x27;ve made clear in emails to their support team, is to get really firm on their guideline of not letting people book for other people. It is a trust and safety issue--the person booking the Airbnb should be the person staying in the house, PERIOD.)<p>I wrote more about my personal experience a few weeks ago on Facebook [1]. I didn&#x27;t mention some of the particular bad experiences we&#x27;ve had with guests in the post, because I don&#x27;t want to embarrass anyone publicly, but let&#x27;s just say...we have had some really negative, uncomfortable experiences with multiple guests in the past couple months. That&#x27;s after having over 100 positive experiences, but the percentage of positive vs. negative experiences has taken a dramatic negative turn lately.<p>My experiences are not as horrific as the above article--probably in part because we are here when we rent out our master bedroom. However, this definitely is a trend/issue that Airbnb is going to continue to struggle with. I hope their customer service team takes these incidents seriously and continues to make it safer for hosts and guests of the service.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ericabiz/posts/10152926663453305"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/ericabiz/posts/10152926663453305</a>",1430359800

Such advances will necessitate the development of new linguistic abstractions, formal methods, and resource-aware program analyses to discover and specify program transformations, as well as systems designed to monitor changes in the surrounding digital ecosystem. The program is expected to lead to significant improvements in software resilience, reliability and maintainability.<p>Essentially, DARPA wants someone to build them a JVM and languages on top that formally specifies the VM dependencies to ensure secure execution (and execution at all), as well as the semantics of that language on top of the VM. Their goal is to use the formal specification to allow for automatic transfer of the VM to new hardware and platforms without breaking the security by changing something about the security model. A secondary goal is to allow automatic forward porting of things, so we don&#x27;t have to run old iron (which make present security problems), we can run the latest iron with old code.<p>An example of what they&#x27;re looking for is a system where you can provide a formal model of the new hardware, and it will compile a new VM for it which ensures the VM promises are true (which in turn ensures that the software promises are true, and hence that your security works). They&#x27;re just not ready to produce such a thing yet, so they&#x27;re still at the phase where they&#x27;re gathering theoretical work on the topic, to decide on what their final approach will be.<p>This likely relates to their heavy funding of projects like HoTT (along with its applications to cryptography and other uses of formal methods), and is exactly in line with other major DARPA undertakings.",1430359430

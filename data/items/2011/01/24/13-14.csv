Murch says, <i>""Consequently, the editing of 3D films cannot be as rapid as for 2D films, because of this shifting of convergence.""</i> OK, so 3d films have to be edited differently - since when have constraints been an issue in art?<p>But more importantly, the 600 million years of evolution argument doesn't hold the water he is putting in it. 600 million years of evolution did not prepare humans for traveling at 60 mph (much less controlling two tons of steel and insuring the safety of their children, while doing so), nor did it prepare humans for sitting in front of a bright light pecking at keyboards for hours and hours on end.<p>Focusing on one point while converging on another may require practice, but so does operating an RC car. But the fact that a broad swath of the population can readily do it the very first time, speaks against it.<p>Essentially, the case against 3d movies is an appeal to authority, and the article is really a rejection of the art form (3d is the rap music which is replacing their beloved rock and roll). That's not to say that there isn't a lot of schlock 3d - who really expected <i>Green Hornet</i> to be great cinema? - only that there is nothing inherently wrong with the medium.",1295877542

2135151,comment,2134846,2134846,0,0,Miky,,,"His example of C vs C++ doesn't take advantage of virtual functions/polymorphism at all, which is a much more significant part of the ""syntactic sugar"" that C++ adds over C, and is what I would say makes it OO.<p>So what if it's ""just"" syntactic sugar anyway? Calling functions in C is just syntactic sugar on top of messing with the stack. You could make the claim that any feature of any programming language is just syntactic sugar on top of something lower-level, eventually getting down to the circuitry. But that's not a terribly useful criticism.<p>The definition of OO to me is a certain kind of polymorphism, which is fit by class hierarchies in Java, Ruby, etc., multimethods in CLOS, and typeclasses in Haskell (although Haskell in general isn't OO), although of course, that's not an authoritative definition either.",1295877253

2135116,story,,,3,0,kalude,"UX/UI guy + business guy, looking for technical co-founder",,"I realize it's a bit audacious to post what is essentially a 'job listing' on HN, but my partner and I really think we have a great opportunity to offer. (Right, right… doesn't everyone?)<p>//About us:\nWe're two guys creating a rich internet application to streamline online collaboration. The need for this product is something we both recognized independently, while working in two completely dissimilar industries. We did our research, identified several shortcomings prevalent in existing products, and developed a unique application to address these issues. I come from a background in web development and graphic design, so I'm handling the UX/UI. My partner started and expanded multiple social initiatives as a teenager and currently works in finance; he's handling the business end.<p>We've made great progress, but we're clearly missing 1/3 of the team without our technical co-founder. We want to get this person on board immediately so they can help shape the product from the beginning. Equity will be split evenly between the 3 of us, assuming we all get along during a short trial period and decide to work together permanently.<p>//Our progress:\nWe've taken care of all the major up-front research; competitive analysis, market research, tentative financial projections, and so on. Thanks to my partner, we've already been speaking regularly with several potential investors, including one who is the Managing General Partner of a $150+ million early stage venture capital firm.<p>On the technical front, we've done a fair amount of research on different RIA frameworks/toolkits. We're not sold on any particular one, but would instead like our technical co-founder to take the lead and make the final decision. So this person will have direct influence on the product right out of the gate.<p>//We have:\n1) A comprehensive business plan. It's been strengthened with feedback from several entrepreneur friends. A couple of investors are looking it over now.\n2) Detailed mockups. We've shown them to several groups of people and iterated based on feedback.\n3) Detailed notes on app functionality/flow. We're also working on a more formal functional spec doc, but want our tech co-founder to help with that.<p>//What our tech co-founder should have:\n1) Genuine interest in online collaboration\n2) Ambition; the desire to work on an original idea that isn't just a copycat product with a minor twist \n3) Adaptability and an open mind\n4) The ability to articulate technical concepts and lead/instruct others\n5) Desire to actively contribute to a project, not just write code<p>If this piques your interest, we'd love to chat. We're based in NYC, so we can do coffee if you're in the area, or Skype/phone if you're not. We're open to having someone work remotely, but we're more than happy to assist in relocation to NYC if that interests you.<p>//Tl;dr:\nWe're two guys who work really well together and bring complimentary skills to the table. We have a unique product idea, connections to investors, and we're looking for a talented tech co-founder eager to work on an innovative product.<p>Please feel free to express interest here or send an email to hi@kalude.com. \nIf you email, we would appreciate the inclusion of links to previous work (or your GitHub account, or something…) so we have a frame of reference when getting back to you. We have no idea what kind of response to expect from this, if any, but we'll do our best to get back to everyone.<p>//A little more about us:\nI'm a project manager at a digital marketing agency. It's a very small group, so I've had plenty of experience getting my hands dirty in various areas. I've tinkered with open source content management systems, done a little bit of database work, created countless wireframes and workflow mockups, and so on. Additionally, I've been developing websites since age 12, so I have about 15 years of front end coding experience. I possess enough technical knowledge to hold my own in a conversation about technical minutiae, so if we need to have real a discussion about latency issues due to scaling, I won't just stare and ask if we should 'get more bandwidths'. My responsibilities include:\n1) The UX and UI (in our product, these are atypically major components)\n2) Project management\n3) Marketing\n4) Front-end coding (when I can be of use)<p>My partner is handling the business side. He has a history of starting and expanding global social initiatives, including a program sponsored by the UN, Reuters, Sony, and the IUCN. He currently works for the corporate strategy group of a major financial institution and has great connections through his university's alumni network. My partner's responsibilities include:\n1) The legal, business, and sales stuff\n2) Securing funds\n3) Bringing in-depth knowledge of the enterprise market and the online collaboration needs of bigger businesses\n4) Handling the day-to-day business operations (once we really get going)<p>My partner and I work well together and this is a project we both care a lot about. We're looking for someone who is equally passionate and able to handle a serious debate about some random product feature-- then crack a joke and get along just fine afterward. We also like to goof around and tend to be pretty sarcastic, so someone with a similar temperament would be great (though it's not required).",1295876354

Also, there is no need to burden a learning programmer with pointers, and clojure doesn't bother you with that, it's all ""by-value"".<p>2) clojure has great data types - After all, it's all about data. Clojure shines with elegant notation and powerful processing of data structures, which IMHO is very easy and straightforward to grasp.<p>3) clojure has a REPL - Learning by doing helps a great deal to get a feeling for programming, because of the direct feedback.<p>4) <a href=""http://try-clojure.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://try-clojure.org/</a> - No need to install anything - get started instantly, do the further steps later.

So, thinking about where you're going to want to be in 10 to 15 years, will taking 3 years off for a degree hurt you or help you?<p>Also think about location.  Degrees really don't matter much in Silicon Valley.  I'm not so sure about NYC or Boston, however.  The culture was very much more ""degree centric"" out East when I lived outside of Boston.<p>There is a ton of BS in college.  And, frankly, you, in particular don't need college to be an entrepreneur.  You might pick up a good bit more about algorithms or data mining or NLP than you would if you're a self taught programmer.  But you are going to do very well as an entrepreneur with or without a degree.<p>But, even with all the BS, I completely enjoyed the time I spent taking fun classes.  I always took a huge number of classes that I didn't need, simply because I was curious and wanted to learn.   So, I took a ton of philosophy, comparative religions, sociology, psychology, literature, art history, and design classes.  Because of that I was exposed to a bunch of ideas that I wouldn't have been exposed to otherwise.  And, I think that's made me a much more well rounded person than I would have been otherwise.<p>But, then, I've been going to college on and off for 17 years, and I still don't have my Bachelor's.  I'm sure that your parents wouldn't approve.  Mom still reminds me every month that I don't have my bachelor's yet.

While the university itself is great I sometimes really don't get what the real benefit of studying is.\nOf course many job listings state that a B.Sc or similar is required but really: why?<p>Until I began to study I invested a lot of time in interesting technical things. I learned how the web works. I contributed to various open source projects related to web technologies.\nI love to learn new things and I think that I'm quite good at teaching myself.\nNow I don't have enough time to do it as much as I want.<p>In university there is also a lot of stuff that I could learn. However I don't see the need for this kind of knowledge.\nWhile people often say: ""Doing a B.Sc you prove that you can work in a scientific way."", I don't see many real-life situations where this would be a requirement or even a nice-to-have.<p>Beside studying I work for a business consultancy held by students and at a smaller startup located here in Berlin.<p>I sometimes think that I could make a living with the skills I already have. Regarding that and the fact that I'm constantly improving and extending my skillset I don't get the point of studying.<p>-----------\nThe first and only answer:<p>Given other factors are mostly equal, an employer might prefer a candidate w/ a degree. It proves you're smart enough to handle the math and other rigor that usually comes with a CS degree.<p>Mastery of algorithms, a topic covered heavily in most CS programs, is quite important for anyone who wants to write code as a part of their job.<p>Some would also argue that the seemingly useless CS topics like advanced complexity theory or set theory make you smarter and will help you design solutions to problems at any level.<p>-----------\nA comment I wrote to this answer:<p>Thank you.<p>Regarding math:\nMath is boring. I'm not attending at the lectures and when I'm doing my homework I'm learning all the stuff myself with the material that was given to me as a student.\nI'm investing a lot of time into doing homework while not seeing any benefit from it (now or even in future).\nWhile I think that I could motivate myself a lot more solving real problems and ""learning math by doing"" (with some guidance) I'm just solving problems that don't have any relation to life, science or anything.\nIn real world there probably aren't many mathematicians calculating just for the sake of it.\nThere is always a higher target and math is often a needed tool to achieve this target.<p>Regarding algorithms:\nI learned about 3-4 algorithms by the time I started studying (I already know some of them from highschool/college). I'm personally interested in algorithms and I'd love to study things like http://sortvis.org/index.html. However I don't find the time to because I have to invest a lot of time into doing time-intensive math homeworks.\nUnfortunately nobody would give me a certificate in some way that I understood what I teached myself.\nThats the reason I'm studying.<p>Regarding smartness:\nI think smartness comes with experience and the will to tackle problems that seem unsolveable.\nAt some point of course it's quite important to be able to make thoughtful/powerful abstractions but I think that's something no one can really ""teach"" you.\nProbably it's possible to get this deeper understanding and this ability to abstract by understanding other complex areas of science.\n(What I'd love to do.)<p>I feel like studying at an university is not the way of learning that suits me best.\nThis makes me kind of sad, since stopping to study doesn't seem like an option but continuing would mean not doing what I think is right.\nAnd obviously this would not produce the best results.<p>BTW; My spoken and probably also my written English gets worse every day. No courses in English and rarely people around to talk to in English. Things I also had more time for when I did attend to college.<p>I'm super thankful for any advice, whatever it might be.<p>––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<p>And here is the link: http://www.quora.com/Why-should-I-study-computer-science<p>If you recognize this as a cross posting I'm sorry.\nHowever I feel like I have to do it since I couldn't get much out of Quora.<p>Thank you,\nMartin",1295874169

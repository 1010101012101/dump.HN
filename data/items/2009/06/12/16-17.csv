Maybe, but unlikely, as one of the points of FPS games is to immerse people in a world, and making that world look as real as possible is part of that goal.  Right now, I'm having a hard time thinking of an FPS game that is non-realistic (Madworld on Wii?)",1244825970

Certain ideas/libraries/techniques will be created and professed so emphatically by their proponent that people accept them as gospel and ""the right way."" In reality, they're no better (or are sometimes worse) than the alternatives (testing framework, ""best practices/agile"", and source control standpoints are recent such issues).<p>I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing, since overly confident people can often be stretched into living up to their claims and genius can often result from that. I'd actually consider David Heinemeier Hansson an example of this. He has admitted his lack of experience when he started programming in Ruby and building Rails (as part of Basecamp) but his emphatic delivery of its benefits back in 2004 led to him picking up followers, gaining marketshare, learning a lot and becoming the genuinely gifted visionary we have today.",1244823790

I'd look into doing something like the following, which is largely what you've already thought of:<p>- umbrella corp<p>-- project corp #1<p>-- project corp #2<p>I'd be working on new ideas (incubating, so to speak) within ""umbrella corp"" itself, and then spin off a ""project corp #"" when you're ready to start looking for/making money.<p>I think there are some disadvantages to this, depending on how your local state/provincial and federal grant systems work.  For example, here in Canada, we have SR&ED (Scientific Research and Experimental Development) which helps companies that do R&D by offsetting expenses.  I believe that any R&D you did in ""umbrella corp"" applies only to expenses made within that same company - NOT after you had spun the idea off into a ""project corp #"".<p>Regardless of what country you live in, if you're looking to protect your other ideas/IP, you are certainly well advised to isolate the investment-worthy idea in its own corporation, and likely with ownership of the ""project corp #"" held by ""umbrella corp""...<p>... unless you're looking to give out dividends to yourself from ""project corp #"" in the future. If you yourself don't own shares, I don't think you could get dividends - only a salary.<p>Ok, obviously I'm digressing.  Final advice - don't listen to me.

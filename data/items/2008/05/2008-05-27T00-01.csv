200563,comment,200421,200485,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"it is like being an artist (let's say a painter). You spend  9 months day in and day out painting a ""Mona Lisa"". You better make sure all the notables like your work. If not you may as well have been working for the love of it because the guys who walk in the gallery will only eat your cheese, drink your wine, have a quick look at your painting and at best comment about it. But no money will be spent. Well unless you manage to sell them premium wine and cheese.<p>EDIT: @Diego. Had I read you comment, I would probably write mine differently. Apologies.",1211849670

I work at businesses all over Manhattan and I find that I'm the only guy bagging my own lunch (seriously - never seen anybody else do it in the two years I've been doing this here). I'm from the south, so I find the NYC idea of ""budgeting"" to be absolutely laughable.",1211849446

200557,comment,200370,200370,0,0,yan,,,"I think asking what a high level language is akin to asking ""What is tall?"" If you're talking about buildings, tall can mean one thing, if you're talking about toddlers, tall can mean another. Haskell can seem like a low-level language to, say, English.<p>A ""level"" of a language is a very relative concept, but you can approximately define a hierarchy of languages relating the level of one language to another using some arbitrary comparison.<p>Since my background is in operating systems and some compilers, I'd say anything C and anything higher level is ""high level,"" but then again, that can mean anything :)",1211849060

Work double shifts during planting and harvesting, single shift and part time the rest of the year.  Live for free, write software the rest of the time.  Bank everything.  All you'd need is broadband and some deposit slips.  By the time your software was done, you could be your own angel.",1211848245

Steve Barsh argues you need to define your customer, their problem, and your extremely compelling solution, then code.<p>PG tends to argue the other way - code first, release early, GET USERS, and then have them define the solution they need.<p>Working with a number of businesses I don't think there's a right or wrong.

7210069,comment,7208674,7210054,6,0,oleganza,,,"Many people misunderstand what the Ponzi scheme is. In Ponzi scheme you get a dividend without selling off your shares. The fraud here is to tell you that the dividends are taken from real profits while they are paid from extra recently sold shares. You get both cash and keep your stock.<p>Bitcoin is like a dividend-free stock or commodity: you have to sell your share to get some cash. Of course, those who come earlier get easier access to more shares, but they are exposed to a higher risk. Zuckerberg had 100% of Facebook initially and was selling it partially to get more cash to keep it going. When he started anyone could do the same, but not many succeeded. Later investors were willing to pay higher amounts of money when the value of the company became more certain in their eyes. But in each case, the owners of stock had to lose some part of it to enjoy extra cash.<p>Also, consider this approach: <a href=""http://auroracoin.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://auroracoin.org</a> \nThese guys intend to distribute coins &quot;fairly&quot; to each individual in Iceland. Sounds like a fair distribution? Well, once some individuals get this weird coin, they will decide if they want to keep it. And some of them will sell them to collectors for cheap. This will make the price go down noticeably and cause more folks to get rid of such coins. So they will end up for very cheap in the hands of a very few &quot;early adopters&quot;. Whether it will start growing organically from there or not - is another question, but you can see that you cannot force &quot;equality and fairness&quot; on the market. It will reconfigure itself according to everyone&#x27;s personal preferences. And in case of a weird new tech it will always mean little number of early believers vs. big number of mainstream doubters.",1392026385

7210065,comment,7205759,7209550,1,0,dpe82,,,"It&#x27;s hard to know. Speakers are insanely complex beasts whose electrical reactance changes depending on the signal. To simplify things we use measures like RMS current ratings for amplifiers because if you put a sine wave through a speaker they tend to approximate a resistive load due to most of the load being air, and we use nominal impedance to describe speakers because while even though for something as simple as a sine wave a speaker&#x27;s impedance can vary 4x from nominal depending on frequency, it at least gives us something we can reliably measure.<p>Once the signal is more complex than a sine wave things get crazy. The more frequencies in a signal, the harder it is to model the power draw since different parts of a complex curve cause the speaker to act more like the low resistance inductor it actually is. Discontinuities and areas of constant voltage (both caused by clipping) are the worst, and to make things even more fun the amplifier is part of the system and affects things as well.<p>But assuming you know a lot about the speaker, the amplifier and the DAC you could probably build a model that works well for simple sinusoidal audio, but that doesn&#x27;t cause problems anyway. All bets are off for anything more complex.<p>So instead you&#x27;re left with a few options: buy reasonable gear and don&#x27;t play crap audio, play crap audio but massively overbuild your system so you lower the risk of getting into the unknowable danger zone that changes depending on what you&#x27;re playing, or use a bunch of heuristics on a signal and try to distort it in some way so it&#x27;s less potentially damaging.<p>The problem with the latter is since you don&#x27;t know where the line is it&#x27;s easy to be overzealous and end up distorting lots of stuff you don&#x27;t need to. Problem with the middle is you either end up with something much larger and more expensive than you need, or you cripple what you have to give you a wider margin of safety. Problem with the first is apps like VLC make it exceptionally easy to accidentally play crap audio. Pick your poison.<p>Could Dell spend a couple extra bucks for higher quality components and create a wider margin of safety? Probably yes. But at the same time the VLC developers are being reckless by putting a tool into consumers hands that makes it so easy to play potentially damaging audio signals.<p>Edit: clarifications",1392026294

I clearly did not have any role model that I can look at to play around with computers on the TV (I&#x27;m not young)<p>I think that the inner motivation to be a hacker or programmer comes from liking to know how things work, and how to build stuff.

Can someone who knows about these things enlighten me?<p>That&#x27;s easy to explain:<p>1. Corporate boards should show a fair representation of the largest stockholders.<p>2. For a board with 100 members, it should be apparent that anyone with more than 1% of the corporation&#x27;s stock must be given a place on the board. But this only makes a point and isn&#x27;t a typical board -- 100 members is unwieldy.<p>3. Another case is one in which the majority of the corporation stock is held by many small investors and there are only a few majority stockholders. In this case, someone holding more than an individual investor but less than the majority investors may still earn a place, even on a relatively small board.<p>4. Another way to describe this is to take the number of board seats and distribute them among those individuals who hold the largest stock holdings, in declining order. For example, let&#x27;s say there are ten board positions, five majority stockholders and a pool of smaller investors with quickly declining stock percentages. In this case, a stockholder with a very small stake might acquire a position on the board simply by being counted among the ten largest stockholders.",1392025608

It&#x27;s always painful when a subculture you feel at home in enters common culture and moves itself out of your comfort zone in the process. I&#x27;d feel even more sorry for you though if your sphere of empathy wouldn&#x27;t ever expand to include the more feminine geeks that currently don&#x27;t feel welcome in our industry.<p>The author of the story wrote this from a good heart and a desire to say the right thing and get people to skip all those frustrating awkward stages in between but unfortunately I&#x27;d say that is as useful telling someone who&#x27;s stressed to just relax: it might even work for some people but if you really care about the outcome relying only on this tactic leaves a lot of room for improvement.<p>That&#x27;s why I will continue to do what I feel is best to make our industry more inclusive. The simple fact that we&#x27;re having this discussion here is made possible by people like me who&#x27;ve repeatedly criticized pg for letting gender issue stories be flagged off the front page so easily and I&#x27;m grateful for having played a small part in that small change.<p>As a genderfluid person from the same generation as the author it&#x27;s truly a breath of fresh air for me to see thoughts and perspectives I&#x27;ve always had discussed out in the open. I for one feel more at home in the industry already through this all.\nIf it&#x27;s like that for <i>me</i>, someone who can at least always choose to pass as male, then I&#x27;m sure many women feel the same and as far as I&#x27;m concerned that&#x27;s a good thing worth fighting for.<p>And yes, I acknowledge that will make things harder for you, the author and her son. I believe though that an industry where everyone feels welcome regardless of gender, which just isn&#x27;t the case right now and hasn&#x27;t been for a long time, will be worth every ounce of sacrifice it takes.<p>> Any given feminist will happily claim to be the voice of all women everywhere.<p>That&#x27;s a rather dubiously broad statement; but if that happens then call them out on it. Improve the discourse. Ask them if they want to feel the pressure of having their every action represent their entire gender. If they say no then remind them they shouldn&#x27;t be speaking for their entire gender either.",1392025022

Boys aren&#x27;t coddled or soothed, they&#x27;re expected to learn self-restraint, and expected to just get on with it. They&#x27;re also expected from a young age to put up with being treated somewhat scornfully, so negative socialization has less of an impact. If we look at what VonGuard said of the boys he teaches [0], he said they &#x27;go off ahead and get lost&#x27;. Note how this isn&#x27;t shown as a positive trait (e.g. &#x27;they try extra hard to learn beyond their limits, even if it proves tough&#x27;), but instead as a negative trait, as a problem they&#x27;ve put themselves into. Note how the girls in his example are shown as being cooperative by helping one another, rather than the more uncharitable explanation being offered: they&#x27;re not brave enough to own their own mistakes, so instead try to distribute them across a group.<p>I remember this exact same rhetoric all throughout school. It&#x27;s frankly unsurprising therefore, that more boys are more comfortable doing something that leads them to be ostracized, or to become a target. It&#x27;s also unsurprising that more boys are happy to enter tech, where you&#x27;re expected to constantly teach yourself without others helping you. For all the VonGuard&#x27;s and the education system&#x27;s suggestions to the contrary, working together and being cooperative isn&#x27;t sustainable in a professional programming environment where you have to be comfortable with constantly keeping <i>yourself</i> up to date with changes in tech.<p>Frankly, the actual solution to the &#x27;girls in tech&#x27; problem is going to be one that few pseudo-feminist social justice warriors will actually want to bear: stop attempting to blame conspiracy theories for the low levels of women in tech, and start raising girls in the same harsh ways as boys.

For people not getting the joke, adding two random numbers reduces the randomness and concentrates the results around a mean.<p>Interestingly, the perception that adding random numbers together results in even more random numbers is behind the popularity of the scam game &quot;razzle&quot;. In razzle there&#x27;s usually a board containing an array of depressions each lined up with a different value onto which is dropped a number of marbles (there are other ways to play as well, including dice). The important part is the scoring board. After each toss the values where all the marbles landed are added up and then a board is consulted to see how many &quot;points&quot; are scored from that value. The game is easy, get to 10 points and you win. However, there are two tricks. First, the scoring board is arranged in non sequential order. This is to conceal the fact that the group of middle numbers do not win any points. In actuality it is very difficult to win any points, since the probabilities are all concentrated in the middle. Second, because of the scattered nature of the scoring board it&#x27;s very easy for the person running the game to cheat in your favor by &quot;accidentally&quot; giving you points when you shouldn&#x27;t have earned them. The scam then works fairly simply. People pay money for each throw, and they are given the opportunity to win a high value prize. For the early throws the operator goes quickly and fudges the score lookups, building up points for the player that they haven&#x27;t actually used, and giving them an unwarranted confidence in the game. After the player gets within a point or so of winning the operator then lets stops cheating and lets them play completely fairly on their own, at which point they have odds of worse than a thousand to one of winning (keeping in mind that it costs money for every throw).",1392023202

It used to be you could get an entry level job and company X, and expect a regular set of promotions up the chain, now, to get that promotion, you need to go work some place else almost.",1392023093

One is for work, the other one is more general purpose. There will always be more cars than trucks, but there will always be a need for trucks. You&#x27;re not going to be hauling manure or towing a boat in a car.<p>The question for MS is will they be OK with selling trucks in a car world? Will they be satisfied with how much money they would make selling only trucks to farmers and construction companies?<p>I say MS needs to make cars and trucks. They need to make the best trucks out there without compromises. The best cars without compromises. Not this weird car/truck hybrid.",1392023061

Nobody[1] is saying systemd should be expunged from the repositories or removed as an <i>option</i>.<p>The concern is that a newcomer (i.e. potentially buggy, but could prove itself over time) to the area of &quot;init software&quot; is demanding to be the only software allowed for that particular problem. Even more concerning is how that same newcomer as monopolistic tendencies, and has started tying/bundling together several neighboring software niches, demanding that the <i>currently used</i> and <i>working</i> solutions in those areas be abandoned as well, because of some made up requirement.<p>If you or anybody else wants to run systemd, you should. In reading these discussion on it, it even sounds like a great choice for some situations (the people setting up &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of mostly-identical systems seem to like it a lot). Some distros make it the default? Why not, variety is one of the great things about having multiple distros to choose from.<p>Insistence that OpenRC and such must make way for systemd is enough provoke a rather strong reaction. The deliberate incompatibilities to force adoption, on the other hand, are borderline <i>fighting words</i>.<p>This pattern - trying to suppress competing ideas while claiming the opposition is being unreasonable for suggesting some sort of compromise - is something I&#x27;ve had to fight in politics for a long time. It&#x27;s expected any time atheism or gay marriage is brought up.<p>I never thought I would see that kind of &quot;argument&quot; used seriously[2] over UNIX...<p>1: &quot;nobody&quot;, modulo the rare fanatic/ass that you find in any sufficiently large group of people.

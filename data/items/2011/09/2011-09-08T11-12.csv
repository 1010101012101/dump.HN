Before this vote, the limit was set at 50 years, which meant that all those bands from the 1960s, who <i>are</i> still making decent money, would start to lose income.  Think the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, the Supremes, Bob Dylan.<p>Of course, I don't feel terribly much sympathy for them - they've all lived lives of privilege that I will probably never know, and I don't see why they should be able to continue making even more money from something they did half a century ago.<p>I wouldn't mind so much, except that in the music world, the idea of a derived work has received such a broad definition by the legal system.

2973498,comment,2969568,2973154,2,0,trevelyan,,,"Say's Law implies that you can only have structural unemployment: the unemployment rate should never be above 4 percent for any real length of time. Even before the Great Depression this was obviously wrong, but no-one had a cogent explanation for why (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave</a> for an example of the sort of tortured logic people tried to use to explain the recurring bouts of prolonged mass unemployment).<p>Keynes' General Theory was revolutionary because it attacked the foundations of the classical economics which were still taught but which clearly failed to describe the real world. His book outlined a number of reasons why economies don't stay in equilibrium: expectation changes, wage stickiness, the ""animal spirits"" of investors, etc.. You can take or leave his individual points (people have tried regressing them out), but at the end of the day he was a voice in the wilderness telling the world that deflation was bad at a time when conservative economists were advocating deflation as the solution (!!!). Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon at the time was even saying the same sort of thing we hear from Austrians and Ron Paul today, that the solution to the Great Depression required the government to ""liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate [and] purge the rottenness out of the system.""<p>This was actually monetary policy after 1928 and it only made things worse, tanking the economy and ultimately sparking a series of bank crises in 1931. Yet there is no explanation for how things could have gone so badly according to the classical economic theories which predate Keynes. Keynes' core insight was showing on a theoretical basis how economies can fall into suboptimal equilibria (""liquidity traps"") characterized by high unemployment and deflation and fail to recover on their own. By the time Friedman made the remark that ""we are all Keynesians now,"" he was pointing out that even Keynes' critics accepted his points as true by the 1970s, a time when the academic debate had shifted to whether fiscal policy (government spending) or monetary policy (interest rate manipulation) made for better policy.<p>> Keynes promotes printing of money and lots of government spending<p>This is the sort of thing you hear from people who haven't read him - Keynes did not champion indebtedness. The closest you will get is an allegory he presents in the General Theory of having the government bury money in mineshafts so the unemployed can dig them up.<p>Republicans trumpet this example as absurd because they think Keynes is telling us to pay people to dig holes. In fact, Keynes knew the example was absurd and was using it to parody his critics. Replace the moneybags with gold and you have exactly what happens to deflationary economies on the gold standard: as the value of gold rises in relation to the currency, the economy devotes more resources to digging up gold until the money supply expands enough that deflation stops. It is not hard to see from this example that embracing deflation is about as silly paying someone to dig holes in the ground, and actually much worse given the enormous social costs of mass unemployment you have to suffer in the meantime.",1315482890

2973494,comment,2973301,2973465,6,0,zhoutong,,,"Yeah, I understand your concern. Bitcoinica has several features/characteristics that make itself like no other:<p>- There's no Bitcoin wallet. Most incidents happen with stolen or lost wallets. Bitcoinica holds all the money and coins in traditional banks and other exchanges (currently only Mt. Gox).<p>- Bitcoinica runs on Heroku. Generally apps hosted in the cloud are more secure. Ruby on Rails itself is very secure too. (protect_from_forgery, html escape, force_ssl, etc)<p>- No account minimums. If you're unsure, you can deposit $1 first and try to do some trades.<p>- Margin trading. This reduces risks. You don't have to deposit 100 BTC worth of USD when you want to long/short a 100 BTC position. 20 BTC is enough. Only when you lose a lot, you can consider adding more margin.<p>I think trust is a common problem for all websites like Bitcoinica. That's why we designed the platform in the way that attempts to solve the fundamental problems.<p>There's instant deposit and withdrawal too. You can transfer money from Mt. Gox when you want to trade and transfer it back after you close your position. (Assume that you trust Mt. Gox.)",1315482861

Gox limits withdrawals, including redeemable codes. Can be lifted though.) Even if that happens in reality, I have already designed some counter-measures:<p>- The system will automatically break large orders down to 50 BTC increments in a chain. Execution of new orders in the chain will require validation of status of previous rebalance process.<p>- Limit orders won't be executed further, because the price must increase.<p>- Market orders will be executed at higher and higher prices, and due to low liquidity, the spread will be larger too.<p>- The user will run out of margin very soon.<p>Since I mention that Bitcoinica guarantees liquidity, measures like this must be implemented. Hopefully they are useful to counter malicious trading attempts too.<p>I'll think about this in detail though. Will further refine my algorithms before the launch of Trading API (which is very dangerous if the algorithms are problematic).<p>Edit: line breaks",1315482337

The code shipping on Honeycomb device is not available.<p>>You don't have access to the ""very latest code"" for the Linux kernel either<p>Using an 8 month old version of the Android source is not the same as not having access to kernel code that is still being written. With the linux kernel you can access code as soon as it is committed to kernal.org, with Android you only get to see it after an entire new version of the OS has been released (and sometimes not even then). It is perhaps difficult to draw a solid line here, and pedants will complain that you don't have access to code that still only exists in Linus' brain, but there seems to be a pretty clear difference to me.",1315479898

If you have a file that is top secret dont have it on the internet whether it be your email, in dropbox or even on your own aws/hosted server.<p>Keep it on a flash drive and have it stapled to your arm if you want to transport it. For images that you want to share, or files that you kinda dont give a rats about if they were to get compromised or disappear, place them in places on the internet that match their confidentiality requirements (email - for secure, dropbox - for kinda secure or your own private server - for very secure)<p>I think arguing whether a new solution is required because dropbox can't do the job or whether dropbox can keep your files safe is a moot point. If your files are on the internet they are never 100% safe. Just keep your most private files on an external hard disk and have that disk detached from your computer and the only risk you run is if someone robs your house.<p>I personally think dropbox is great for what i use it for, i put images that i want to share, i transfer files to friends overseas and we all happily share our stuff easily and seamlessly and if i wanna access it i login through the browser or install a new client. WIN. No other service at the moment does it this easily for me. If any of my files where compromised, well whatever, a few holiday pictures or some itineraries.<p>The legal responsibility is put on Dropbox to keep your stuff safe, but I think the ""common sense"" responsibility is put on the user to decide whether s/he thinks dropbox is the place for a specific file.",1315479840

7036357,comment,7036205,7036205,10,0,regal,,,"Facebook may be targeting more traditional big brand advertisers than it is small business advertisers (who need ads to convert to sales in a much tighter window). e.g., the Coca-Cola commercial you see on TV probably doesn&#x27;t make a single person get up out of his chair, go grab his car keys, and drive to the store and buy a Coke. Yet, over time, get exposed to enough of those ads, and when it&#x27;s time to buy, your hand instinctively goes for the one your brain is bombarded with ads for all day.<p>Then again, Facebook ads give advertisers much less of an &quot;in your face, brainwashing you against your will&quot; impact than TV commercials do.<p>This might just be a case of a revenue model that simply doesn&#x27;t fit the platform. It may be that Facebook is going to have to figure out another way to justify its high P/E ratio.",1389358725

Besides Zipline, the MOAI-using community is flourishing .. there is a de-facto effort to address the issues you mention (Binary SDK releases being one of the most important ones), and there has been a lot of progress in the last 6 months towards merging everyones&#x27; branches.<p>>At the very least some of them could get together to coordinate stewardship of the project, something which seems completely lacking right now.<p>Pay more attention to the forums at getmoai.com if you think this is the situation at the moment, because actually there is stewardship occurring by some of the core MOAI guys.  The effort to pull all requests into a new branch and prepare for a community-release is definitely well under way, and you may indeed see the issues you brought up, addressed properly in a few weeks.  MOAI is in the transition stages from being a proprietary (yet open) software stack developed by a single company, towards a proper community-supported effort like we all know and love.  This will happen.",1389355256

Even on a single screen, I&#x27;ve generally got at least a couple of columns up, so I can understand the utility of greater real estate. With multiple monitors, you can open two frames up, use next-multiframe-window and it mostly behaves like a giant emacs across two screens.<p>That said, I almost exclusively work on a 15&quot; retina MBP and don&#x27;t find myself annoyed, so I guess you&#x27;re right. :)",1389355252

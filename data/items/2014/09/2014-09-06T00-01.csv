For instance, they can enter a property if they have a warrant, whereas if someone else does this, it is break and enter. If the FBI established &quot;probable cause&quot; that the server is used for crime, they could have gotten a warrant. I can&#x27;t imagine it would have been difficult, so why wouldn&#x27;t they have taken the legal precaution.",1409965105

Standard Oil and U.S. Steel if you go back to the last century.<p>Basically, it&#x27;s rational for a company CEO to invest all profits back into the business as long as he expects he can make a better return for them than the market can.  Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s annual reports go into more detail in this.  The trick is in recognizing the size of the market opportunity in front of you, so that you know when to switch from reinvesting profits to distributing them as dividends.  Microsoft waited too long for this - they burned (and are still burning) billion on unprofitable business lines.  Google has had debatable success - some of their new businesses are brilliant, some are huge flops.",1409964903

The difference between me saying &quot;you must choose a branch of psychology to call unscientific&quot; and &quot;I do not personally possess the knowledge or capability to stand up for branches of psychology I do not know enough about it&quot; seems pretty substantive.<p>> No, I start with how science is defined, note that psychology cannot meet the definition<p>If you&#x27;re relying on wikipedia, allow me to do so as well: science is the systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. You take issue with the latter, but many psychological theories do them, no matter how much cotton you stick in your ears.<p>I do not argue that the DSM lacks scientific credibility.<p>> None of the were falsified as that term is defined in science, by way of empirical evidence, the kind of evidence not accessible to those who study the mind.<p>No matter how loud you say it, it doesn&#x27;t make it more true. You demand that it is true, but it is not. You sit at the armchair, reading no research or studies whatsoever, and judge me for 1) being unwilling to comment on issues which I&#x27;m ignorant on and 2) not being an expert at all things psychology.<p>Re: Skinner - you are correct, though he had few &quot;theories&quot; to be wrong about. I meant E.L. Thorndike, Skinner&#x27;s predecessor (and the other one with a famous &quot;box&quot;). His theory of learning was his greatest achievement, but he eventually repudiated it.<p>Re: Piaget - that is the person wiki, this is the relevant one: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget%27s_theory_of_cognitive_development#Challenges_to_Piagetian_stage_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget%27s_theory_of_cognitive_...</a>  Nobody is a classic Piaget psychologist anymore. Did they throw it all out and start over? No, they did not, the iterated and keep testing. If that&#x27;s the red flag to you, then there you go.<p>> Like science?<p>Sure, like science.

If you take the comma into consideration, sure, you could even claim that I&#x27;m taking their best interest before their customers. It&#x27;s a stretch, but if we want to pick apart words, sure.<p>Why would you never ask if it benefits Coursera? There are people who have an interest in them not failing, whether it be people making money, or people using the service. It seems you&#x27;re only considering the people with money at stake. What about the people who rely on Coursera for the educational content?<p>I don&#x27;t understand how Coursera being the one to come forward in any way deflects attention from their failings. It would literally be them bringing attention to the issue. Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding you here, but to me it seems that the company coming forward show not only responsibility, but maybe even some humility -- acknowledging their failure rather than trying to cover it up. And maybe you&#x27;ll find that a bit of a stretch, but I&#x27;ll try to give some credit for attempting at least.<p>That said, the message they did publish (see the current top comment on the post) doesn&#x27;t really seem to do a great job of stating what actually happened, or what they&#x27;re doing now, so it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s also going to be &#x27;too little, too late&#x27; in many people&#x27;s eyes, as they now look like they&#x27;re trying to backtrack to cover themselves after being exposed by the author of the article.<p>The &quot;precluding others from acting&quot; thing is what I&#x27;ve been trying to say this whole time. No, his findings, and being told that they are in the process of fixing it does NOT prevent him from publishing his findings (clearly, as he did). However, they made clear they were working on it (or at least enough so that he acknowledged they were), and it seems to me that he has now kind of cut their legs out from under them, exposing their failings <i>while</i> they were working on them and <i>before</i> they made the announcement themselves. It just seems tactless to me, regardless of who it benefits. I don&#x27;t mean this as &quot;oh, poor Coursera, they&#x27;ve been made fool of on the internet&quot; or anything like that, it just kind of rubs me the wrong way. Take that for what you will, clearly you don&#x27;t feel the same way.<p>Regarding the less tech savvy, you&#x27;ve got it backwards. I in no way mean that we should be less concerned for less savvy users -- just the opposite. If we&#x27;re going to expose a vulnerability that affects them, we <i>should</i> go out of our way to defend them (or, the responsible party should). The author of this article does not do this, and consequently leaves them exposed without any opportunity for remediation.<p>I really think you&#x27;re misunderstanding me. I think Coursera should have all the blame, and I think they should be the ones responsible for coming forward with their problems, what they&#x27;re doing about it, and what their users can do about it. If they had failed to do so, then yes, absolutely someone should come forward and warn the public. That wasn&#x27;t the situation here -- when contacted, they immediately began working to fix the problems.<p>The only thing they didn&#x27;t do was immediately announce to everyone that there may be security flaws. Should they have? Perhaps, but then at that point, they&#x27;re making themselves a target until they complete their fixes. Announcing the problem after the fix seems a pretty standard procedure to me. So again, to make clear and alleviate any remaining doubts you have, yes, Coursera screwed up. I think everyone knows this by now. They&#x27;ve also gone through the steps they needed to take to fix the problems now (as far as we know). I still don&#x27;t think it was responsible for the author of the article to release this before they had completed those fixes, though.",1409963449

I agree with your number one use case, but it&#x27;s not the most important use case there is.<p>The biggest reward of a PKB for me has been that sitting down to write a summary of what I read ingrains the new information in my mind. It&#x27;s the writing that is the learning. I tend to reproduce the same thoughts I wrote later, even if I don&#x27;t go back to read what I wrote. A PKB with little ability to organize is just as useful for me.<p>Building a PKB isn&#x27;t even the most important problem in my life. Few people on their deathbed will say: I wish my PKB had feature x. A more important problem is you&#x27;ll wish you had <i>changed yourself</i> to have been strong enough to make different decisions throughout your life.<p>So I&#x27;m going to go on a limb here and suggest something slightly preposterous about building a personal knowledgebase: you don&#x27;t need one. What you need is what people fear the most: change.<p>I&#x27;ve been in grad school too, and used a PKB religiously, and came out the other side realizing I made a big mistake: I shouldn&#x27;t have gone through grad school. Not only did having a PKB not help me with that, but it also distracted me from facing the real problem that I was avoiding.

For instance, on any other carrier, they cram their links and ""preferred partners"" on starting page.<p>Again, I agree there are limitations.

There's a concept called Induced Demand. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand</a>)<p>There are many drivers who stay off the roads because the cost of congestion is too high. For instance, people who won't take a given trip if it takes longer than 20 minutes. By increasing road capacity the trip time goes down to 15 minutes. This induces demand from the crowd that desires <20-minute trips. As they join the crowds on the road, they bring congestion back to its equilibrium level of a 20-minute trip.",1218313504

But he's dead wrong about the 20th century.  The 20th century saw a millennium of progress get wiped away.  Europe had two world wars that displayed levels of barbarism unseen since the Mongol invasion.  Population explosions in Latin America, India, and Africa resulted in masses of people living in  violent, malnourished, overpopulated slums.  The great cities of the United States collapsed into burned out, dystopian ruins, which look like something out of the late Roman empire ( see The Ruins of Detroit for a small taste - <a href=""http://detroityes.com/home.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://detroityes.com/home.htm</a> - but it is the same story in many other cities).

Remember that this is a 3-year prediction and the hours is relevant to that initial timeframe pre-funding.

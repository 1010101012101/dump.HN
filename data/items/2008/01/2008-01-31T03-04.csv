So you would see similar borrowers from few particular regions. I guess it really isn't micro lending when an organization puts up a list of who would benefit. that's still ok. just a sense of false advertising i think. I am loosing some trust in them and something just doesn't feel right. maybe I am wrong but I hope someone comes up with a better system or other types. micro lending is great system indeed.",1201751650

I think the challenge would be how to make functional syntax accesible to the masses. Arc seems to be one step forward, although functional programming will never be for everyone.",1201751491

107240,comment,107222,107235,0,0,shiro,,,"I think its more like going back to the initial spirit of Scheme and making it right: ""Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary.""<p>So, criticizing lack of features is meaningless to Arc.  Valid criticism may be to find weaknesses and restrictions.",1201749623

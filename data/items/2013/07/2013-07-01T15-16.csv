It&#x27;s just a plain old fact that there are far more options for NoSQL storage layers built with linux first in mind than there are windows. Just like there are far more options for games toolkits and libraries built with windows first in mind than there are for linux.<p>RavenDB I had never even heard of before, but it does look like it fits the bill of NoSQL datastore that primary targets windows, compared to the competition though that doesn&#x27;t come near to nullifying my point that it&#x27;s a vastly outscaled matchup. Also, if you even want clustering in RavenDB, you need an enterprise license. There are many completely free NoSQL datastores for linux that handle clustering just fine without an enterprise license.<p>Re MongoDB, it&#x27;s good that they fixed that, however;<p><a href=""https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?sorter/field=resolution&sorter/order=ASC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?sorter/f...</a><p>So there are 117 Windows specific issues with mongodb, many of which have not been touched for years or months, and none of which affect linux.<p>I couldn&#x27;t actually find <i>any</i> tickets which only pertained to linux, though maybe they&#x27;re there they&#x27;re certainly not as common.",1372694368
5971471,comment,5969018,5969216,2,0,RogerL,,,"Your front page is scant on details, and I really don&#x27;t like providing both email and a password just to figure out if I should send money to somebody. You don&#x27;t have a published privacy policy, which reinforces that feeling.<p>Okay, so you say you do C++. What does that mean? Can you compile and see error messages? The editor in the demo has no line numbers - is there any hope in actually deciphering the errors and fixing the problem? Can I, the interviewer, provide or run unit tests against the code? Does the editor have things like auto-complete, code formatting, etc?<p>Okay, I gave up, I signed up. It&#x27;s pretty cool, no, strike that, very cool. I had no idea from your front page. It wasn&#x27;t clear at first that I could experiment endlessly without using my 2 pad quota, which was another thing to add friction for me to try it out. I can see that I can easily paste in some unit tests for the user to use. But, do you have boost, gtest, etc? What version of Python (and all other languages) do you support? What C++ compiler and version are you using? I tried some C++11 code, and it compiled, which is nice, but should I really need to type in test code to figure out what is supported?<p>Site seems very hacked together. Now that I am signed in, I have no way to get back to the start page, the FAQ, and whatever links you had on that front page. The code of my pads seems to somewhat overlay the ad links (select your plans) below. One I start editing code, there is no back button. If I use the browser&#x27;s back button, sure I end up where I was - at the profile, with the new pad I just created not listed as one of my pads until I hit refresh on the browser. If I create a bunch of pads, it just creates them in a never ending expanding list - will I have ways to sort through for different candidates, times, etc? I kind of wonder what happens when you get to 50-60, as you don&#x27;t seem to be storing them in a container - am I going to end up with a huge unmanageable page? Can I delete pads?<p>I also am not crazy about your tiers, though I recognize it is a common strategy. Small shops hire in bursts - a few months go by with few to no interviews, you get funding or a new contract, and suddenly you have 100 people to interview. Do I need to pay for a high tier so I can deal with the bursts? What if I buy the 20/month, and need 21 pads? Can I change my subscription level on a monthly basis? Is it really safe for me to just type my credit card number into your site? Why doesn&#x27;t this just scale to my needs - why do I have to subscribe to tiers? Amazon doesn&#x27;t make me pay for computer services I am not using, why do you?<p>I&#x27;m not looking for the answers to any of the above in this thread - I&#x27;m not going to recommend that my company pays for a service that cannot describe itself on it&#x27;s webpage but eagerly provides me with fields with my credit card info, and whose only contact information is &quot;me&quot;. There&#x27;s not even an address - what recourse do I have if you take my data, or I have billing issues? Are you in the US, the UK, Argentina? Finally, I don&#x27;t believe you can actually provide 24/7 support. I&#x27;m emailing &quot;me@vincentwoo.com&quot; - I doubt one person can service enterprise scale use 24/7. I don&#x27;t even know what your infrastructure is - are you using AWS such that you can easily add nodes as needed, or is this run on a box in your basement that dies when the power goes out?<p>Awesome app, bad site.",1372694353

5971464,comment,5969932,5969932,7,0,sehrope,,,"Remember me cookies are a specific case of some data sent to the client that the server would like to verify at a later point in time. The most direct way that comes to mind for solving this type of problem is to send the client just a random identifier and have the server look it up in a persistent store upon use.<p>The other way of solving it is to have the server sign whatever data is sent to the client via an HMAC. That combined with some basic serialization gets you a generic approach that you can use for all kinds of things. This also has the scalable benefit that it doesn&#x27;t require a centralize persistent store.<p>Here&#x27;s a high level summary of how we handle these use cases:<p># Server -> Client (Assume server wants to round trip object X)<p><pre><code>  1. Server serializes X to a URL friendly string (JSON + Base64 works well enough for this)
  2. Server calls generateToken(type, message, expiration) which signs the message/expiration with secretKey+type. It then returns a JSON/Base64 serialized map containing message/expiration/hmac.
</code></pre>
# Client -> Server<p><pre><code>  1. Client sends back the final JSON/Base64 string
  2. Server decodes and extracts the message, expiration, and hmac
  3. Server verifies the HMAC by regenerating it and comparing it against the client supplied one
  4. Server verifies the expiration date hasn&#x27;t passed
  5. Server returns back the deserialized object
</code></pre>
Couple of notes:<p>* The HMAC prevents the client from tampering with the message<p>* The &#x27;type&#x27; field is so that tokens generated for one request type cannot be accepted somewhere else in the application. It&#x27;s kind of like namespacing.<p>* The &#x27;type&#x27; field does not need to be included in the message itself. It&#x27;s inferred by the server based on the client request type.<p>* The object/message itself can be blank. In that case this becomes a secure expiring token.<p>Couple of possible extensions/improvements:<p>* If the data being sent back/forth is particularly sensitive you could also have the server encrypt either it or the entire message itself. If it&#x27;s not though then it would be overkill.<p>* Including the requesting clients IP in the HMAC generation to further limit the set of user&#x27;s it would validate against is an option as well though generally that&#x27;s a bad idea. People&#x27;s IP addresses change fairly often and that kills the basic use case of taking your work home with you.",1372694286

It is not explicitly counted because the precise sequence of events is very architecture-specific (in a register machine, there will be load/store operations; in a three-address architecture, memory is explicitly accessed by each opcode; in a stack machine, operands need to be pushed onto the stack; etc.), but in any RAM machine the cost of memory access is constant (i.e., it is <i>upper bounded</i> by a constant -- it may be faster if you already have the data in a register or a cache, but the worst case does not depend on the input size or algorithm being run).<p>As for problem sizes not growing, I think your view is a bit limited.  For example, matrices in a financial model might become larger if any number of parameters change -- the time period, the number of instruments, etc.  Sure, there are cases where you can guarantee that the problem size will not change -- but one of the big advantages of software is that it <i>can</i> scale arbitrarily (unlike a matrix multiplier circuit).",1372694141

It&#x27;s considered standard practice to refresh regular session identifiers every X minutes, and this rarely causes race conditions unless your app is AJAX-heavy.<p>My apps regenerate the session identifier every time it detects that it has been more than 5 minutes since the last regeneration. So if a user who has been away for a few hours returns to the site, his session identifier will be immediately regenerated and the old one will become useless. If race conditions become a serious issue, I can allow the old session identifier to continue to work for the next 30 seconds or so. It also shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to add a feature that throws tantrums if someone continues to use the old one much later than that.",1372693938

Think of it as a self-hosted alternative to Dropbox.  With the latest Chrome update, the browser is showing phishing warning (http://patch.codelathe.com/foruser/phish_1.jpg) with our installations.  The warning is not based on the domain and it appears in our different customer installations. It has to be heuristic based because it generates warning even on a debug/local webpage. The chrome browser heuristically decides our login page as a phishing page and gives the wrong warning. We are trying to find if there are any published &quot;guidelines&quot; as to legitimate web pages should NOT be doing to trigger these? Either there should be clear methods to resolve these warnings or Chrome should avoid doing this blanket-so-called-protection racket.
Because of Googles missteps, our reputation as well as customer reputation got a hit. We have spent countless hours in our resources to see what is going on and all thing points to heuristic decision making by Chrome browser.  There is no way to contact Google Chrome team to resolve this issue. We have lost few large deals. Now all our support team is pretty much focused on this issue and fielding queries from our customers.
Since our UI code (Developed in GWT) is common between our Enterprise and Consumer product (Tonido), if we this error start appearing in our consumer version (half a million users) it is an EXISTENTIAL RISK to our company that we have built over 5 years.
We have 2 questions.
1.	How to get in touch with Chrome team and solve the issue?
2.	Are there any legal avenues or precedence to force Google to take action and claim compensation for lost business?
Please provide us with your suggestions.

1. Often 1 month is not enough of a trial period.
2. You will lose tons of great developers who simply will not work on a contract basis.<p>I think the way to approach this is actually a 6 month contract with a garaunteed cash payout at the end equivalent to 6 months of contract value that you get regardless of whether the company renews the contract.",1372693325

I am a part time freelancer who just finished with my last contract. I am a full stack engineer, specializing in advanced backends. My skills include: 
- Backend app development in PHP, Node.js (I am also familiar with Ruby/Sinatra but with limited experience)
- Javascript application development on front-end
- Experience with building apps built for scale. From large scale databases such as MongoDB, to task distribution networks, to zeromq. 
- Experience in semantic HTML and HTML5 APIs.<p>I have pretty reasonable hourly rates, because I work part time. I work as a research engineer in my full time job, but I work a few hours per day to build up some additional savings. However, I am available for weekly calls, and I am dedicated to the work at hand.

5971354,comment,5970248,5971200,2,0,toomuchtodo,,,"Excellent point. I apologize for my brevity in my previous posts.<p>I agree that you can&#x27;t color Microsoft&#x27;s server offerings by their older products (Server 2000, 2003). I do agree that 2008/2012 are much more solid products comparitively speaking, but I still would not use them in a production environment for several reasons:<p>Debugging: Have you ever attempted to debug edge case issues in a Windows server environment? I don&#x27;t mean ASP/.Net issues, but I mean issues within Server itself (random reboots, OS hang, etc). Sometimes, your only answer is &quot;Windows does that occasionally&quot;. I have Linux servers with uptime measured in <i>thousands</i> of days, almost as stable as the solid state networking gear.<p>Cost: I worked on the CMS detector for data taking at the LHC. We had over 6000 servers, not only doing data crunching but also providing REST services, database services (for both data and parallel file system metadata). Everything was Linux. The licensing cost alone for just the Windows OS on all of those machines would have been massive.<p>Patching/Upgrades: The only time you need to reboot a Linux box is when you&#x27;re upgrading/patching the Kernel. Windows boxes? Patch Tuesday. Rarely have software updates broken a Linux box, and if they do, its much easier to revert back to a previously known good config.<p>I can go into greater detail if necessary. I agree, 12 years of experience is just a drop in the bucket, and my experiences are anecdotal in nature. I just rarely see (if ever) someone using Microsoft software in missions critical environments.",1372693291

When reading about it, I thought <i>nice</i> I like the actor paradigm, I was doing a prime solver from someone&#x27;s tutorial, and... It was slow.  Not slow, slow, but slow.<p>Compared the same thing to a similar idea in C# in Rx and in TPL, and in F# and in CamelLight, with one in Java.<p>For my preference the syntax of C# was the best, and funnily enough the old fashioned style implementation I did in Java was the fastest, but not by much at all.  Go was about 20% of the speed of the java one, not much faster than the CamlLight implementation.<p>This wasn&#x27;t scientific, this wasn&#x27;t a fair comparison, but I am cynical about the &#x27;buzz&#x27; or hype for some of these frameworks.<p>People often view things like Node.js as free.

(E3 1245v2 8 ht cores @ 3.4ghz , 2 x 120GB SSD in soft raid and 32gb memory) If you wanted to run windows on those, you&#x27;d need to buy two licenses pushing an extra 50$ a month onto the price. You also wouldn&#x27;t need to screw around with spawned instances in failover, and you could actually use the capacity of both systems at the same time to massively increase your initial capacity before it becomes necessary to expand that investment again and get more steel.<p>None of your windows based software will scale well horizontally, especially at the storage layer compared to the competition, and if you&#x27;re relying on bizspark for the price advantage, you should also mention it expires in 3 years and you then either have to go full in to microsoft licensing and massively increase your software spend, or drop your engineering investment in the past three years and go with something off the MS stack. It sure is a neat trap from microsoft&#x27;s perspective, but it&#x27;s a pretty shitty deal for anyone that actually looks at it economically and long term.<p>On the other hand, if you build your apps around a horizontally scalable storage solution (of which there are about fifty hojillion these days on open source stacks) you have near infinite ability to scale upward by just throwing more boxes at the problem. Visual Studio may be very pretty but for a nice IDE you drop a well behaved git, and everything that goes with it.<p>You also lock your software engineer options to people that are satisfied working on the MS stack, which whilst acknowledging that anecode is not data and all, in my experience means that you will get poor results.<p>If you look around and all you see is masses upon masses of startups pursuing fairly similar infrastructure strategies, you should probably think very hard about why everyone else thinks you&#x27;re wrong before you&#x27;re certain you&#x27;re not.<p>From my perspective the equation looks like this;<p>Pros;<p>Visual studio.<p>MS CLR performs well against python / ruby / php.<p>In a single server environment, you can probably get away without any sysadmin expertise.<p>Cons;<p>Everyone has to use Windows.<p>Storage layer doesn&#x27;t scale well horizontally.<p>Git not so great. (apparently this no longer applies and msysgit works perfectly well now)<p>CLR may perform well compared to interpreted languages, but not so great if you&#x27;re willing to go a bit more esoteric or if you&#x27;re happy with boring old java.<p>Application server scaling is largely the easiest part of any horizontal scaling stack at any rate, minimising the significance of your competition using even extremely slow interpreted languages.<p>Licensing fees are infinitely more than the (typically free) competition. When BizSpark expires, even moreso. And you bought yourself a nice solid vendor lockin by using their sandpit in the meantime.<p>You&#x27;re stuck with microsoft monoculture and all the associated baggage that implies from a HR and strategy perspective.<p>Most of the stuff everyone else is using that you might want access to works either not at all or poorly on windows, meaning when you run up against the same problems as your competition, they&#x27;ll have more ground on you from the get-go. (ansible, redis, practically every NoSQL db in existence, etc etc etc, pick a problem space you need to find a solution in and compare the MS CLR based options to &quot;everything else&quot; and MS rarely comes out on top unless it&#x27;s dealing with MS proprietary formats or interfaces in some way)",1372691942

Or do some freelance work</i>&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t expect to get &quot;normal&quot; tech jobs by the time you&#x27;re good enough unless you can disguise your age, age discrimination is fierce in this field.  But as noted by you and many others, there are many options.<p>I&#x27;d also add that at some point unless you&#x27;ve forgotten all your math and don&#x27;t want to refresh it try <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> (SICP) (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of...</a>, <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-comput...</a>), everything you need is free and online.  If it&#x27;s a good enough fit for you it will teach you some foundational things that&#x27;ll make you a better all around programmer and system designer.  E.g. one way or another learn big O notation (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation</a>) and its significance.<p>Over time, get some breath.  In my book that means try to learn the basics of these languages and concepts and their typical environments: Lisp and recursion (see SICP above, or alternatives on the Wikpedia page plus <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Schemer-4th-Edition/dp/0262560992"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Schemer-4th-Edition/dp/0262...</a> specifically for recursion), C and pointers, HTML, Javascript and browser programming, and some database work, SQL/RDBMS preferred, I recommend PostgreSQL over any of the MySQL variants, but a simple key/value store or embedded SQL database would also get your feet wet.  If you learn recursion and pointers you&#x27;ll be way ahead of most people who believe themselves to be programmers.<p>Good luck!",1372691717

There is not a lot of functionality that <i>requires</i> Javascript.  I understand that having an in-browser spreadsheet automatically update cells as things change is going to be tough without Javascript, but that does not excuse the more basic things people use Javascript for:  form submission, hyperlinks, <i>loading text</i>, etc.  Your design is flawed, at a fundamental level, if you need to do a large amount of extra work to have this basic functionality work without Javascript.<p>Really though, in an age of web toolkits and large frameworks for creating pages with all this Javascript, there should not be any need to make such a choice.  Whatever you are building your website on should already support a non-Javascript version; the only real issue is when you need to do something that is not already part of that toolkit.  Again, I understand that <i>sometimes</i> Javascript really does make a particular feature of a website possible, but I am asserting that the <i>vast majority</i> of Javascript out there has nothing to do with such features.<p>&quot;Surely it&#x27;s up to the team working on it to decide if that time is better spent on something else?&quot;<p>Users have to deal with the consequences of those decisions.

If you look across the board at the increase in prices of just about everything in the past five years, especially yield-generating instruments (dividend stocks, REITs, MLPs, preferred shares, high-yield debt, etc.), I think it&#x27;s hard to argue that investors have shunned public markets. Assets simply can&#x27;t increase that much in value if there are no net buyers.<p>Granted, the low interest rate environment has essentially <i>forced</i> some of these investments and the money fueling them is cheaper than ever, but I don&#x27;t see any evidence that there&#x27;s a large contingent of professional investors fearful of public markets who are plowing their cash into illiquid startup stock instead.<p>If anything, the growth of markets like Second Market suggests that investors are increasingly eager to buy shares of private companies likely to go public in the not too distant future. Recall that there were investors snapping up Facebook shares before the IPO (the latest to the party hoping for a double-digit IPO pop lost a lot of money) and somewhat amazingly, there were even funds dedicated entirely to accumulating pre-IPO shares.<p>Even if you&#x27;re not banking on an IPO as a startup investor, the other liquidity event you&#x27;re looking for (acquisition) typically comes at the hands of a publicly-traded company, particularly if it&#x27;s big, so you have stock market exposure there too.

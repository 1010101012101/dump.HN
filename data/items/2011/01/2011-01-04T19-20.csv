One is that western governments would find it difficult to take freedom away from the internet.<p>The other is that authoritarian governments would either have to abandon the free internet and implement their own locked-down and incompatible one, or they would have to accept that they can't control their people's communications. The advantage this would give the west in any future cold war against China is, I hope, obvious.<p>I'm standing for election to the Scottish parliament later this year.

2068205,comment,2068049,2068049,0,0,jrnkntl,,,"I could never use such an online editor for a couple of reasons:<p>- CSS editing requires a lot of shifting back and forth between preview/css and code completion. A native (mac) app like CSSEdit allows you to open up a 'live preview' that instantly refreshes while you're typing your css.<p>- Access to your local filesystem<p>- Although Cappuccino makes for an 'almost-desktop-like' experience. It's still not the real deal in terms of responsiveness and gui-rendering and you can immediately feel that while using an app like this one. It's a great framework for CRM, TweetDeck-like tools, Inventory systems and the like, but not for a task that requires space, previews and immediate 1:1 response on actions.<p>Could anyone imagine himself using a tool like this?",1294171086
2068204,comment,2067921,2068017,0,0,Zak,,,"It's still a bit problematic. There are two kinds of searches that happen when a person is arrested.<p>The first is called ""search incident to arrest"". It's purpose is to identify any weapons, escape tools or immediate means of destroying evidence on or around a suspect during arrest. Removing a phone from a suspect's immediate control is justified under each theory: the phone may actually be a disguised weapon, it may conceal escape tools and there may be evidence on it that the suspect could destroy. Accessing the data on the phone is not justified under any of these theories.<p>The second is called an inventory search, which usually takes place when a suspect is booked in to jail, a car is impounded or similar. Its purpose is to identify anything dangerous (corrosive chemicals, explosives, etc...) and to protect the authorities from liability for the loss of any property while in custody. Generally, a suspect is presented with a list of property found and asked to sign a declaration that it is complete so that he cannot later claim property was lost or stolen. An inventory search probably does not require or allow accessing the data on a computer or storage device.<p>The court ruled that it was a valid search incident to arrest, and that the police were entitled to inspect the contents of an item taken from the person of a suspect during a legal arrest. The justification for inspecting contents is, as I understand it similar to the above: to identify potentially dangerous items before storing the defendant's property, and to have an accurate inventory of what property the authorities are assuming responsibility for. Examining the <i>data</i> on a device almost certainly doesn't meet the first standard, and seems very questionable for the second.",1294171081

2068135,comment,2067532,2067532,0,0,WiseWeasel,,,"Personally, I think the solution that could get some kind of market traction would be to sell WiFi routers that can organize themselves into Metropolitan Area Networks. A certain portion of the units is instructed to become 'long-distance' nodes, connecting to other nodes a mile or two away, and shifting large amounts of data between them. Another portion of the units is instructed to become 'medium-distance' nodes, distributing the traffic from the long-distance nodes to devices within a few thousand foot radius, and all devices are simultaneously capable of being 'short-distance' nodes, connecting directly to end-user devices. Since it takes more resources and a better antenna to run a long-distance node, routers capable of acting as long-distance could possibly be distinct from medium-distance-capable ones, and sold at a premium, with an assurance that local devices connecting to it will get better network performance. Apart from that, devices become either long, medium or short-range nodes depending on network and geographical needs.<p>The market for these devices will of course get its start with piracy and porn, just like any good burgeoning internet protocol, but you can bet local TV stations, radio stations and advertisers would be all over them to get their content out without having to pay the traditional network gatekeepers. Content producers would get free access to the network if they just run a node or two.<p>Eventually, as the metropolitan area networks become dense enough and spread out widely enough, it will be possible to link the different cities to each-other and start to create another wide-scale network. Until that happens, though, there's enough going on in most metropolitan areas to give more than enough value to a decentralized network such as this.",1294169606

Nor did it make sense any time before it if having less children but more successful ones didn't translate in those children themselves having more offspring than if they had had brothers. The path to reproductive success is to make sure your children reach adulthood and can have children of their own..., ideally so your descendants grow exponentially. I don't know how making sure my kid has a Playstation 3 and an HD TV guarantees that he will have more reproductive success. College you say? Any lower-middle class person can go to college, you'll just get into debt like everybody else. Besides you don't need a college degree to reproduce, how are immigrants doing it then?<p>2) I know that you weren't arguing for any of this, but I'd really like to see citation for this one. Maybe during a time of famine it would be true, but how exactly would I be less healthy if I had 10 siblings?<p>3) I don't know if they are more promiscuous or not, but they are definitely not having more children, that's the whole point of these ideas about idiocracy.<p>I didn't cover the successful couples that don't have kids at all, which are a lot of them. Please, explain to me how that makes sense, not having children will help your reproductive success because...? How is that not a wrong move?<p>You might think that it's the right move if having only one well provided child made sure that he went to the top of society, i.e. become a millionaire, which is very unlikely anyway for most people. If your line of descendants has just one child over a few generations, your original DNA that is in that person will be a small part of him. I think the person whose descendants had at least 3 children each generation will  have a greater chance of having his genetic legacy survive even if those descendants are a little less well off, which doesn't need to be true.<p>I would really like to believe that you are right and in fact there is something we are not seeing.

View area.  We are a profitable software company founded by two
hackers who are working to change healthcare in America by giving
physicians software tools to treat patients better.  We are currently
operational and have hundreds of paying healthcare professionals using
our products across the U.S.  We are in the Winter 2011 class of
Y Combinator as we prepare for our large outside fund raising round to
scale up our system and completely revolutionize healthcare!  Our goal
is to make doctors more efficient, improve the quality of care
patients get, and change healthcare for the better!<p>Since we are profitable we can afford to pay salaries, but we are
really interested in finding dedicated hackers who care about doing
something meaningful and are willing to take a larger equity stake and
little to no salary while we are in Y Combinator and preparing to
raise an outside VC round (after which we can quickly scale up to
industry standard salaries.)<p>The required skills we are looking for are strong Python/Django web
development skills and/or strong Objective-C iPad development
experience.  A large part of our platform is for native mobile
devices: iPad, iPhone, and Android, but these are not required skills
and we will train really strong Python/Django developers on these
mobile platform programming skills.  We can guarantee that smart hard
working programmers will rise far in the company and will have a
bright future in learning new skills and growing with the company as
we get funded and expand.<p>We are a diverse and hard working company.  We want to build a great
culture where everyone can work hard and be proud of the work we are
all doing.  We are tackling the most difficult problem facing the
country today, healthcare reform, and using the hottest and most
powerful technologies on the planet to kick healthcare's ass.  We can
guarantee that anyone working with us will wake up every morning ready
to work hard because they know they are making a positive difference
on the world and helping to tackle the toughest problem facing our
country.<p>Email your resume to us: ycombinator.company@gmail.com",1294168688

I experimented on it for months before finally figuring out that well over 50% of the power draw on the system is the data network (mobile network option when you hold down power). If you have it on when you have really weak/no reception, the phone will burn through the full battery in about 4 hours and it's pretty simple to lose 20% battery in 15 minutes. If you always have a decent connection, your battery life will be fine, if you happen to live in a place where you have holes in your coverage (e.g. NYC urban canyons), battery life is terrible.<p>After realizing that, I set up a set of Locale rules to shut down the network when I'm on the wireless network at home/work and to shut it down when I lose signal.

It may be a highly flawed meritocracy susceptible to overvaluing labels or fads of the day, but ultimately tenure is bestowed on those who earn the respect of their peers...""<p>I wonder whether these flaws are in fact fatal to this guy's thesis. My understanding of academia (based solely on an M.S. and indirect observation of friends in the Ph. D process) is that academia is every bit as political as industry. It's not enough to have and publish good ideas, as one would expect in a true meritocracy. It's about having the right sort of ideas - ideas which are unusual enough to attract attention but not so unusual they get dismissed without real consideration. Branding and marketing are words I hear my academic friends throw out far too often to make me comfortable with the assertion that academia is, in fact, a meritocracy and not just a highly esoteric rat-race. A true meritocracy is either objective or as isolated from subjectivity as possible (e.g. a round-robin sports schedule where every team plays every other team in the conference). A system that requires the subjective approval of others for success (publication, employment, tenure) isn't much of a meritocracy at all.<p>tl; dr - This guy's admission that tenure is based on the ""respect of peers"" is a pretty big hole in his argument.",1294168439

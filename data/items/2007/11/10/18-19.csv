I must admit that I was against the change in the first few days, but slowly i started to learn more through links that related to science, philosophy and even architecture. There are still some parasite links. If you open your house to everyone you can rest assure  that some people (who love disorder) will walk in and try to destroy it. Overall I still like HackerNewsNetworks and although I am not a Hacker I can still acquire a tremendous amount of knowledge. ",1194721127

78181,comment,78148,78166,0,0,bluishgreen,,,"In that aspect I think hacker news is still not getting the message. Three possibilities :<p>1.To use your own metaphor, if you keep the animal in the cage for a long time, it takes a while for it to figure out that the cage has been lifted. But then this group animal never seems to get the hang of it. Perhaps this is a data point in group theory, namely that a group has far more inertia than single units.<p>2.Or perhaps the hackers are too busy startupping that they just cant be bothered about Intellectual curiosity<p>3.Or the third inference is the Hacker types that visit here are not into much else. An article about Pythagoras theorem being useful to measure n-dimensional distances made it into discussion here. In the math circles that concept is akin to understanding a ""hello world"" program. It is not surprising that experts in one area are totally naive in others, but I was hoping that hacker news could be a tool to alleviate that at least to some extent by bringing pointers and some discussion.<p>A long time back, I made this comment, and you agreed.<p>""*8 points by bluishgreen 132 days ago | link\nIt has become apparent that the quality of these social news sites depends on the quality/commitment of the society that is supporting it. It would be very interesting and useful to find out what the start up folks are doing on a daily basis besides thinking about start ups. Like I said, this could be a very good inspiration tool.<p>Lisp was a landmark in my large scale understanding of computer science. I wonder what are the landmarks in understanding something like physics, or say bio-informatics. What are the problems that these people are facing? Hackers like learning just for the heck of it. In the process we can bring about useful start ups to these domains instead of making another calender application and stacking outside some big huge company in the hopes of being acquired.<p>I am not asking for a general news site. I am asking for a site where news.yc culture and outlook is preserved, but the domain is slightly relaxed (Note: the relaxing should stop well before we start seeing LOL(pic) in the submissions). If you won't keep the same URL, its ok, as long as you some how figure out how to set up that ""outlook""""<p>Its in my nature to be optimistic, but 132 days hence, I don't think we are there yet. <p>Link to original discussion: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31791"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31791</a>",1194720762

78179,comment,78148,78162,0,0,breck,,,"I think you're being a little too broad with your stereotypes:<p>""Many are too advanced, and too busy hacking, to even bother with sites like this or reddit""<p>""news.ycombinator.com appeals to the low end of the technical hacker continuum, and more to entrepreneurial/business oriented hackers""<p>I don't think being an advanced programmer and being business oriented are mutually exclusive. While I personally fit your stereotype(business oriented, low end of the technical spectrum--although I'd put myself in the top 10%), I know a few HackerNews readers who are both brilliant hackers and business minded. Plus if you make some money, you have more freedom to hack.",1194720452

78177,comment,78128,78128,0,0,shayan,,,"I <i>love</i> Pink Floyd ... this is a cool experiment, but how did they come up with the magical number! 15 secs apart?  what if you play some other song and mix the solos with 12, or 20 sec apart maybe you can find something that works for them ... also it sounds like the first one is louder than the second one that comes in later, so its a bit hard to tell if you would get the same thing if they were both the same level",1194719741

78173,comment,78148,78148,0,0,shayan,,,"I would say it's a more useful tool to hackers that are interested in starting their own business... so useful to startup founders (or to-be founders) ... if you are doing your homework, many of the news you read here you might have already seen in your RSS reader, <i>but</i> I think you can sense the feel of community and how its different with all the other alternatives that are out there, when you see postings that are mostly tagged by <i>Ask YC</i> (I mostly mean postings like this one that is not linked to an article and is starting a discussion) ...  The community here is definitely unique, and when discussions begin you can take advantage of who is here, their knowledge and experiences",1194719221
78172,comment,77888,77888,0,0,Mistone,,,"I'm 28, starting a startup, and have a wonderful little man (14 months), and a terrific wife.  I would caution people from trying to do both.  No matter how much time you spend with the tike, when your always trying to squeeze in a few extra hours on the startup things get wobbly. <p>One of the areas I have had the hardest time with is getting consistent quality time with my wife.  Spending a few hours each evening, say 7-9 hanging with your family is no problem and you get lots of great time reading books, playing, and feeding, but when 9:15 rolls around and you want to get back to work, that's when the trouble begins. <p>While I'm not giving up, and am now trying to ensure I make more time for my wife so we don't loose sight of why we feel in love and got married then we will be alright.  <p>So if its a choice - do one first and the other next - if it just happens - like life - then be vigilant about putting time and attention into your family - things can unravel fast and its no fun to feel like your risking your awesome family for your risky startup.\n",1194719161

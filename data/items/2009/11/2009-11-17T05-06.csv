946036,comment,945961,945961,0,0,jerf,,,"Seems like a better idea would be to just have the server aggressively shove resources down the wire much like standard HTTP pipelining, except where the server doesn't wait for the client to request them. Have the client send a flag up saying it's willing to accept this in the initial request. You get much the same effect, only without adding ZIP files to the mix.<p>You also get the ability to have proper headers on each element; this solves every ""Additional Note"" they mention. Some obvious extensions involve things like sending up all the E-Tags the client knows about in the first request. I think it's a lot simpler than their approach and retains more of HTTP. Yeah, it's slightly less bandwidth efficient (though to make the difference large you need pathological examples), but I think it's worth it.",1258437105

946030,comment,945350,946019,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"That doesn't appear to be the case in general. According to the link I posted (which gets it's data from the American Time User Survey), even young teachers tend to work less than 40 hours. Note that this survey asks the question ""how many hours did you spend working yesterday, how many hours sleeping, etc"", not ""how much time were you paid for yesterday"".<p>The study does however suggest that teachers do show up early and work at home more than other professionals.<p>Regarding total working hours, I'm guessing the teachers you know are either highly atypical or else they have unrealistic ideas about how much they really work.",1258436788

946023,comment,945923,945977,0,0,joeyh,,,"Hi, I wrote ikiwiki.<p>I'm glad to see some (more) competition; generating a static wiki out of markdown files kept in an arbitrary VCS seemed like such an obvious Right Thing that I was amazed nobody had quite done it before when I started in 2006. So it's good to see this and other projects like gitit explore the space some more.<p>The setup procedure you linked to uses a VCS because most people want to, but ikiwiki is VCS agnostic right down to running w/o one, and can be used in quite light-weight, simple ways. (Ie: Make a directory; put an index.mdwn in it; run `ikiwiki src public_html`to build and publish; done.)<p>I'm curious: Does markdoc really require its own built-in http server? Or was that included only to ease basic setup? And does it support editing pages via the web? Does its caching allow it to do incremental builds of only changed files, or is the whole wiki re-rendered each time it is built?",1258436251
946022,comment,945889,946002,0,0,gruseom,,,"Hmm, but the paper mostly argues that that performance advantage comes automatically from using RAM instead of disk. The only obstacle they mention to realizing 5-10µs latency <i>per se</i> is that networking infrastructure can't yet support it. No question that's a big deal, but they spend far more time talking about durability, data models, distribution and scaling, all of which are auxiliary to raw latency. I'm not criticizing the paper, just seeking to understand how far the vision they outline really is from current practice.<p>One interesting aspect is the sharp distinction the authors make between the approach they're advocating and systems that make heavy use of RAM caching (obviously common today), <i>even when the RAM caches hold nearly all the data</i>. So ok, let's rule out cache-based systems as instances of what they call RAMclouds. How widespread, today, are true RAM-based systems (as defined in the paper), even if they don't yet achieve 5-10µs round trips to storage? What major systems are in production that can be cited? Google were famous years ago for keeping their web indexes in RAM. Does that count?<p>No question many innovative projects have sprouted up in the last few years in this space (e.g. Redis), and while they sound fabulous, I don't think they count as answers to my question without examples of major systems in production (for some fuzzy value of ""major""). If anyone can cite any, please do.<p>Troll disclaimer: Our startup is currently working on these very issues (storage strategy and how application talks to storage), so my interest is both genuine and acute.<p>PS: <i>Simply storing the data in memory, with backup on disk, is not difficult or novel.</i><p>That's good to hear. What specifically are the common strategies for backup to disk?",1258436237

The rule of thumb that I was told was that you're working about 8 hours of prep for every hour of teaching the first year.  Drafting lesson plans, putting together projects, laying out longer term units of study, things like that.<p>They're only paid for the 8 am - 3 pm (35 hours or so a week, though the pay is per hour better), but most teachers I know show up early and work at home grading, preparing dittos, stuff like that.<p>Add in requirements for Continuing Education, administrative tasks, and non-teaching related requirements that most unions/tenure programs require, and I'd still say it's a surprisingly low paid position for the time that goes into it and the long-term effects on the students.",1258436024

Right now RAM-based systems that I am aware of do not do very much meta-analysis on the access patterns or the data itself to try to migrate or cluster blobs for maximum performance.  We have started to get better at doing this for data on disk (e.g. column-based stores, using large disk chunks to cut down on seeks, etc) but have just started thinking about how things will change when primary data is all in RAM.  We have a lot of experience with dealing with efficient use of disk resources but the world of RAM-resident data is still pretty new and we are learning how many of our assumptions about how things should work based on the world of disk-based storage will carry over to the new paradigm.",1258434696

I'm surprised it fell so far and so fast; I think the trading glitch on NASDAQ took the bubbles out of the champagne for so many people that fiscal reality set in a lot earlier than it would have otherwise. Of course, going on the market at $38 didn't help, but their pricing strategy was sort of constrained by activity on Second Market.",1349888332
4637188,comment,4634549,4635340,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Partitioning can also be thought of a very compressed form of index, most of which are implement as some hierarchical data structure.<p>Yes, fair enough. In such a case, why not use an explicit index like letters of the alphabet, in other words why not reindex the table just once, hierarchically, with something relevant to table searches, in a way that breaks the table up into manageable chunks?<p>I'm only objecting to the idea of a periodic repartition -- it seems inefficient, and according to the linked article, it takes the table out of service for as much as 15 minutes, apparently on a daily basis. To me this sounds hacky and ad-hoc.<p>> To some extent, data reorganization is inevitable ...<p>Yes, but if the solution doesn't address the underlying problem, just the symptom, it will need to be reapplied perpetually.",1349888328

You attempt to instruct the computer to halt the current program when an answer is received, thus preventing the inputs being supplied that would produce the given output. Our current time-based perception says ""paradox"" whereas this proposed hypothesis would say ""the computer simply will not halt the program,"" not because it's designed with safeguards, but because the laws of physics maintain causality.",1349888310

4637168,comment,4636857,4636857,23,0,jawns,,,"A question that has come up more and more lately with similar Kickstarter projects:<p>Is crowd funding a good way to go about this project?  And specifically, is crowd funding through Kickstarter a good way to go about this project?<p>Basically, the project creator has an idea for a product for which he thinks there is a market, but he lacks the capital to get the business off the ground.<p>By using Kickstarter, he's able to acquire the capital, and the backers -- the vast majority of whom, I'm assuming, are either friends who just want to help him out or strangers who just want a bed-desk -- know that they'll get their money back if the goal isn't reached.<p>But once the goal <i>is</i> reached ... that investment becomes a risky investment.  The obligation to actually deliver a product to those investors to whom it was promised is, at best, a moral obligation, rather than a legal one.  Kickstarter has been very insistent on this point lately: If you donate to a project, consider it a donation, not a purchase (<a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-is-not-a-store"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-is-not-a-store</a>).<p>With more artistic projects -- say, a musician raising money to record an album -- I think it's a little bit easier to see those pledges as donations rather than purchases, even if a copy of the album is promised to donors.  Why?  For one, donors are likely to already be fans of the artist and feel a sort of kinship with them.  But probably more importantly, the final cost of the album is likely to be in the $10-$20 range, which is a lot easier to write off, if the artist doesn't deliver, than an expensive piece of furniture.<p>In contrast, with a project like this, I'm assuming that if you're going to ""donate"" $650 or more, you're going to want a bed-desk at the end of it.<p>And at least on Kickstarter's current terms, the arrangement is not favorable to somebody who just wants a bed-desk at the end of it.<p>There may be other crowd-funding options out there that are more favorable to the would-be owners of a bed-desk (for instance, if the project creator were contractually obligated to deliver the product).  Or perhaps the project creator could simply raise $65,000 with micro-loans, then sell the completed product to interested buyers, then use the proceeds to pay back the micro-loans.  At least in that case, it's the aspiring businessman who's on the hook if something goes wrong, not the aspiring bed owners -- which is as it should be, because when an aspiring businessman is willing to take on financial risks, that demonstrates his commitment to the business.  Or, if the project creator is not willing to take on all of that financial risk, perhaps he might be willing to offer equity in the business to potential crowd funders.  That way, you're distributing the risk, but you're also distributing the potential upside, which is only fair, right?<p>As things stand, I just don't see a Kickstarter project for this type of product as being a good deal for anyone but the guy building the bed-desks ... unless you are willing to consider the $650 (or more) you donate to be just that: a donation.",1349888026

You will then, from the outside, be 2.6 feet (or so).  This means that if you from your timeframe accelerate by 1 km/s, to the outside you will accelerate by 0.4 km/s.<p>This acceleration in turn cause you to shrink even further, and as you approach the speed of light your external length will approach 0.

The universe essentially makes your time tick slower in order for light to still travel that much faster relative to you.<p>This phenomenon has been confirmed (along with basically every other prediction that Einstein has made). There are some subatomic particles that we know has a half-life of X seconds. However, when they're traveling quickly, they actually end up living orders of magnitude longer because of time dilation.<p>In every day life, if you throw a ball at 70 mph on top of a car that's going 30 mph, the ball moves at 100 mph.

The torque is available immediately. This is different than traditional engines, where max torque is available at specific levels.

Prefixing or suffixing these names detracts from the perspective of the database as a collection of relations, it gets in the way and makes it more difficult to make names interchangeable.  The ""tbl"" prefix is a defensive decision that is unnecessary and detracts from the notion of the schema as a collection of relations.<p>It is more common to have qualification for objects that aren't collections of rows, like sequences, constraints, and indexes.  These are qualifications like ""fk_"", ""pk_"", ""uniq_"", etc. and they serve the purpose of being able to distinguish between ""relations"", which are the primary API of the database, and ""supporting"" constructs.  These names need to be distinguished from table names as well as from each other and with the exception of sequences are also not present in SQL statements, only DDL.<p>Consider why none of the other names in relational databases are prefixed as to their type.

It hosts more unique product photos than pretty much any other company out there and for a long time, it surfaced those product images as 140px x 140px thumbnails. Focusing on showing larger, higher-quality images is going to be a big win for users.<p>That being said, I don't have much confidence in their feed setup. eBay is trying to create an entirely new browsing behavior and while it will definitely result in new sales (how could it not over the old homepage?), the mashup up of a users varied interests into one feed is incredibly disorienting.

If you're relying on inline SQL, you're forced to choose between habitually violating the DRY principle or resorting to an unmaintainable mishmash of server-side and client-side queries.<p>2. Testability.  The good unit testing frameworks for SQL code are written in SQL, and designed to be used from an SQL development environment (i.e., the database).

4636923,comment,4636365,4636866,5,0,nddrylliog,,,"Hey there, thanks for what has to be the most insightful and constructive comment of the thread!<p>I agree with what you're saying. To me, all this is part of a bigger issue which is the ""mass culture"". That society is only comfortable with having one, perhaps two, providers for every kind of service is similar to the fact that apparently, society needs blockbusters and music hits to find some kind of balance. So that when you meet someone, you actually have common points to discuss.<p>I haven't yet taken the time to address that issue in blog form, though, because it's really complex and I don't want to half-ass it. I don't think it'll ever be completely solved in this lifetime either.<p>Part of the social factors that, for example, prevent a mass migration from Facebook or Twitter are the network effects you mention ""People go to that site as well because it has the best and most active conversation."". In my opinion, this can be somewhat mitigated by having open protocols for everything. If the discussion happens not on a single platform, but on a set of platforms all talking the same language, you could (in theory) use any client to follow the discussion and it wouldn't even matter where the video is hosted.<p>Online identity and presence is very hard to define/to bound: e-mail is hard to switch because your e-mail address contains the domain name of your provider (user@provider.tld). It's easier to switch from a web hosting company to another because there you usually control the DNS (except if you're stuck with a subdomain, which sucks) - so for example, I've been able to switch amos.me from ImmediateVPS to Linode to prgmr without any downtime/relocation issues. E-mail is similarly easy to switch if you own the domain name.<p>But e-mail and personal websites are only part of your online identity: usually, your whole identity is spread among several services: Twitter, Tumblr, HackerNews, Reddit, Flickr. Most people use their homepage as hub/registry to list all their online accounts, but there has to be a better way.<p>But, again, the thing about open protocols is that reducing the switching cost from one service to another is generally not in the interest of any single provider. Only few companies have convictions strong enough to really make migrations seamless. For others, they're mostly coerced to do so because of privacy laws (example: Google's Data Liberation Front) and give you a .zip of your data, but you can't just seamlessly import it into another service.<p>This discussion is too vast, really. I'd love to see the death of mass culture and to see a reversal in the centralization process, but, like you, I have my doubts and questions about it.",1349885342

You can put effort in to anything, but unless it's something you care about (are passionate about), you're not going to want to maintain that effort and actually get good at it. That's where his argument falls apart - the idea that expended effort leads to being good at something which then leads to being passionate about it only works if you expend enough effort to actually get good at it. If you don't care about it, you're likely to quit before you get good.<p>The idea of ""follow your passion"" means you should start expending your effort into something you're passionate about. The problem is that many people don't actually know what it is they're passionate about - and those that do don't understand how to turn that passion into an actual sustainable career.<p>So, I disagree.

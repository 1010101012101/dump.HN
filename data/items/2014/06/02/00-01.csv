Their bids would be less competitive if they had to account for paying the &#x27;appropriate&#x27; rate.<p>> Puerto Rico was a tax haven for a reason. In particular many Pharma companies located operations in PR which created great benefit to that area.<p>Puerto Rico&#x27;s unemployment rate has been above 10% for over 30 years. I suppose you can make the argument that it would be worse but for these tax havens, but good luck with that.<p>>  How many people, on personal income taxes, pay anywhere close to the &quot;rack&quot; rate? Note the use of &quot;official&quot; as if to imply &quot;what they should be doing&quot;.<p>Nearly everyone does. The majority of Americans (upwards of 65%) take standard deductions and their effective tax rate is identical to the prescribed rate based on their income.

7831357,comment,7821917,7823677,1,0,yaddayadda,,,"I was just identifying and summarizing calculations done by others. Among the calculations I analyzed, all included the cost of appeals and housing.<p>In many states there were mandatory appeals for death-row inmates which added to their costs.  For most other sentences there were more limits on appeals which in-turn limited the life-sentence appeals costs.<p>There were higher housing costs for the death-row inmates, although I don&#x27;t remember seeing a breakdown.  I always assumed the differences were because of increased security costs.  The housing costs were for entire expected sentences, not by year (while a life-sentence inmate would be expected to need housing for a longer time, the costs were still less than a death-row inmate&#x27;s costs until execution).<p>Also, in many prisons, the life-sentence inmates could participate in work programs, with some of the related income being funneled back into the prison.  At the time I was doing my research I couldn&#x27;t find any work programs that allowed death-row inmates to participate.  So not only were the life-sentence inmates cheaper, they could potentially work to reduce their own costs.",1401670660

However, if product management is too much under the thumb of sales, or if they are too much under the thumb of development and disconnected from sales, they don&#x27;t have the visibility they need into one end or the other. Further, there will be pressure from their bosses to advocate more for their side.<p>To me, the best PMs are good mediators. Not only do they know how to schedule requirements and decide scope, they know how to communicate that effectively, and get buy-in from both sales and development with a minimum of squabbling. Because of this, if they&#x27;re capable of doing their job effectively they don&#x27;t need sales or development to report directly to them, and likewise they shouldn&#x27;t be reporting to either sales or development.<p>If leadership feels the need to put product management under sales or under development, chances are they need to hire new PMs.<p>I completely agree though that good PMs are rare, exceedingly difficult to hire for, and worth double their weight in gold.",1401670558

After working with the utilities industries (mostly natural gas industries) I can tell you with 100% certainty that more than 80% of the by products from the burning of coal, including CO2, can be removed using scrubbing technologies and filters. In many cases the cost to install these technologies are lower than the costs to convert a plant to natural gas. The problem is that EPA regulations on coal are driving the costs up (by making it harder to mine and transport) to the point where in the long run natural gas is cheaper (though get a change in the US administration and that could sway the other way again)(Edit: Which is why a lot of coal plants are being converted to natural gas). My point is that if coal didn&#x27;t cost as much as it currently does (because of federal regulation) a number of technologies could be installed that would enable coal plants to continue to be used with much much less environmental impact.",1401670451

The problem is, being able to be a good manager requires a lot more domain knowledge than a lot of people realize, IMO, and so it ends up that often times the best product managers are people that either evolved into it from a design or development standpoint, or a person that had a lot of good domain knowledge in the subject matter that could step in.

I could understand why, as a developer, someone would not want a <i>bad</i> product manager, but a good one should make a developer&#x27;s life easier.<p>Developers are the ones who should be coming up with ideas about HOW to do things. Make something more efficient? Dev. Implement an incredible new technical feature? Dev.<p>Product Managers are the ones who talk to the customer and steward non-technical vision. They are the bridge between sales people—who are incentivized to say yes to every customer request—and developers—who in most cases do not have the time to be thinking about what a customer might want, doing customer interviews, etc. Product managers are there to avoid the lukewarm tea problem, to adhere to a coherent version of a product, and to help coordinate the many parties who have an interest in seeing a product succeed but who might have different perspectives on what that means.<p>Some places that have Product Managers (or Product Somethings (editors, gurus, swamis, whatever)): Apple, Google, Dropbox, Box, Evernote, Square (they exist, I know some who fill these roles), Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, Spotify, and many others. These people not only exist but also are a central communication hub if they are doing their jobs right. Today&#x27;s shining stars of PM are Apple (for hardware), Google, and Facebook. Everyone wants to hire people away from those teams.<p>The thing that bothers me about the other comments on this thread is the attitude of superiority that some people are taking: &quot;if you aren&#x27;t a dev/engineer/technical person, you aren&#x27;t worth shit.&quot; Sure, in some companies, technical ability is all you need. But in most, particularly anything of reasonable size, you need a variety of people. Developers are not lawyers or finance people. In many cases, developers don&#x27;t want to interview customers or aren&#x27;t good at it. Developers are GREAT at developing (at least some are, others are complete clowns who have no ideas what they are doing), they chose to develop, but a company is so much more than development.<p>A great team--across all roles--is what makes a company great, and that includes product managers.",1401669155

(In contrast, when a wafer has a bunch of tiny chips, a given defect only takes out one small chip, and you still have the other N-1 to use.) Ultimately this drives up cost to the end-user.<p>Fab equipment also has limits in how big a single chip can be due to &quot;reticle limits&quot;, i.e., the size of a single mask exposure, and a chip has to be a single exposure (per layer).<p>The CAD software (place+route) might actually be a limiter here too. Even if, in theory, you had an FPGA with enough logic blocks to match a modern GPU&#x27;s raw gate count (i.e., circuit size), an FPGA is just a sea of identical configurable blocks and parts of the circuit are assigned to the blocks and connected with wires using something like simulated annealing. This is why FPGA place+route takes so long. In contrast, a custom chip can put exactly the right gates and wires at exactly the right places, and especially for something like a GPU or a large cache where there are lots of repeated elements, this human involvement makes things much more tractable. (It&#x27;s also why e.g. the caches on a modern CPU die look so pretty, like a big grid of farms or something -- an FPGA-synthesized CPU cache would look nothing like that, and take much more space!)<p>All of that said -- from an academic point of view, this GPGPU core is an impressive piece of work, especially given that it includes an LLVM backend!",1401668432

Lovecraft [2]:<p><i>About the time I joined the United I was none too fond of existence. I was 23 years of age, and realised that my infirmities would withhold me from success in the world at large. Feeling like a cipher, I felt that I might well be erased. But later I realised that even success is empty. Failure though I be, I shall reach a level with the greatest — and the smallest — in the damp earth or on the final pyre. And I saw that in the interim trivialities are not to be despised. Success is a relative thing — and the victory of a boy at marbles is equal to the victory of an Octavius at Actium when measured by the scale of cosmic infinity.<p>That I have been able to cheer here and there and aged man, an infirm old lady, a dull youth, or a person deprived by circumstances of education, affords to me a sense of being not altogether useless, which almost forms a substitute for the real success I shall never know. What matter if none hear of my labours, or if those labours touch only the afflicted and the mediocre?<p>Surely it is well that the happiness of the unfortunate be made as great as possible; and he who is kind, helpful, and patient, with his fellow-sufferers, adds as truly to the world’s combined fund of tranquillity as he who, with greater endowments, promotes the birth of empires, or advances the knowledge and civilisation of mankind.

7831215,comment,7830950,7830950,12,0,apenwarr,,,"The analysis in this article is horrifically poor.  Among other things, just using the expected error rate as a pass/fail criterion is not a good idea.  Even if the &quot;typical&quot; RAID5 array doesn&#x27;t fail, isn&#x27;t it still bad if 1/10 or 1/100th of them fail because of randomness in the error distribution?<p>There are also lots of ways to mitigate this problem even with a high error rate.  In particular, if you get a bad sector, don&#x27;t just kick the disk immediately out of the RAID; try recovering that one sector first, using the other disks in the RAID.  The drive&#x27;s built-in sector remapping should then bypass the newly-bad sector.<p>I wrote about this in detail in 2008: <a href=""http://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=200809#08"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=200809#08</a>",1401667449

All of my friends and I were in IRC trying to download the damn thing from DCC bots.<p>I was lucky and got a slot that provided the full 80kbyte/s. I finished the download first, but my PC was pretty old back then so I didn&#x27;t even bother trying to run it. Instead, I removed my hard drive (my system drive!), picked up a friend and we drove to another friend who had the fastest PC at the time. About 30 mins later all of us (I believe 5 or 6 guys) gathered in a tiny dorm and just stood in awe as we booted up HL2.<p>There was barely any gameplay present. You could just walk around in some maps and admire the graphics. It didn&#x27;t matter. If we hadn&#x27;t been stoked before, we were now.<p>In hindsight, this all was just an amazing PR stunt.

You go to their daily status meetings with a heavy feeling in your heart. You explain time after time to them that no, you can&#x27;t use XML for that, that adding 12 programmers to the project won&#x27;t bring in the schedule by six months, and that the slide deck they&#x27;re giving to management in an hour has so many mistakes and fantastic assumptions that it might as well be crayon drawings by a three year old. The specs they write, if they exist at all, are mostly schedules and technical buzzwords and are useless. Typically, they love SharePoint.<p>Good PMs are very, very hard to find.",1401667430

In fact, it would be pretty hard for a consumer to not know about it since the law requires that you be asked to set the kill switch up when you initially set up the device. You can refuse if you do not wish to have the kill switch.",1420091888

8822289,comment,8821931,8822275,0,0,ladzoppelin,,,"&quot;Deaths&quot; decreased but what about cases of cancer? Is it constant?<p>EDIT: Found this exert after going through the whole Cancer Institute pdf: 
&quot;
The overall rate of cancer cases (incidence) remained stable for women between 2007 and 2011, but declined by 1.8 percent per year for men.<p>Men experienced relatively rapid declines in cases of colon cancer (3.6 percent per year), lung cancer (3 percent per year) and prostate cancer (2.1 percent per year) during that period, the report found.<p>But there&#x27;s been no change in incidence rates for breast cancer. And the report found that certain cancers are even on the rise. For example, thyroid cancer cases increased an average 4.5 percent per year between 2007 and 2011, and liver cancer cases have increased by more than 3 percent.<p>The increase in liver cancer cases is largely due to hepatitis C infection, mainly through intravenous drug use and sharing needles in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Jemal said.<p>The rise in thyroid cancer cases cannot be easily explained, Jemal said. Some suspect the condition may be now overdiagnosed due to the overuse of imaging scans and ultrasound, he said, but there&#x27;s also been an increase in the size of cancerous lesions found.<p>&quot;For thyroid, it&#x27;s very difficult to explain what&#x27;s occurring,&quot; he said&quot;",1420091755

I&#x27;ve never worked in payments or accounting.</i><p>Mt. Gox had a financial control problem less complex than that faced by the typical supermarket.  A supermarket has cash going in and out, multiple cash registers, multiple cashiers on different shifts, credit cards, checks, benefit cards, and automated checkout lanes. That&#x27;s just the front side - there&#x27;s a comparable operation at the back, where merchandise comes in and is accounted for.  A big supermarket has a higher transaction rate than Mt. Gox did.<p>If a $10 bill goes missing in a supermarket, the management will know at the end of the day, and will probably be able to figure out where it went. This is routine cash control.  It&#x27;s a solved problem.<p>Mt. Gox had no financial controls; we know that from press reports.  None.  They don&#x27;t even seem to have had a general ledger.  This is rare in real businesses, but it&#x27;s common in fraud schemes.  Fraudsters don&#x27;t want accounting controls, with everything they&#x27;re stealing on the record.<p>Anyway, on Jan 3, we&#x27;ll hear more.  That this story came from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police is significant.  The police haven&#x27;t said anything until now, except that they were investigating.  That silence has ended.

8822249,comment,8821138,8821138,0,0,soup10,,,"As a one man army indie game developer I basically can no longer maintain my code-base without going crazy because it&#x27;s grown to the point where it&#x27;s no longer a one man job.  I knew this would be a problem, so keeping code complexity to a minimum has always been a priority, but it&#x27;s no longer possible to keep up.  Thankfully it&#x27;s reached maturity as a product and is a fun and profitable game.   Many people think i&#x27;m &#x27;brilliant&#x27; when they see the product and they hear i&#x27;m the only the developer and it&#x27;s a custom 3d engine. But truth of the matter is much of my brilliance was stubbornness and cleverness in keeping things simple and code complexity to a minimum.   The problem is you run out of memory in your brain. You forget how systems work.  You have to trace back through the code and &quot;reload things&quot;. When you have to make a modification.<p>When I hit my human ram capacity so to speak, i was extremely frustrated that I couldn&#x27;t make the boundlessly quick progress that I used to.  But then you get used to it, and just accept that it will take time when you switch from one subsystem to the other, to load up the relevant parts of the code into your human ram in order to do be able to do the work you want to do.<p>The simpler and more straightforward the program architecture, the easier it is to jump into and out of and write new code.  Of course understanding what your product is and is going to be helps tremendously in making sure you can design your program in a sensible way.... I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to have a firm intuitive understanding of future the design of the game and it&#x27;s features as it was being formed.  (not being at the mercy of clients or bad managers is a wonderful thing)<p>What i&#x27;ve noticed is a big difference from me and friends with small development studios that accomplish less with a lot more sweat. Is that I don&#x27;t develop fully featured flexible systems when simple ones will do, I don&#x27;t roll my own code when good/simple libraries or apis exist.  I&#x27;m trying to make my product a work of art, and the code is functional and simple.  Where often I see other good engineers try to make their code the work of art.   Which leads to lots unnecessary code complexity because they engineer systems designed to be future proof for everything, instead of of what realistically will be necessary for the future of the project or projects.    A system with 30 components is easier to understand and easier to maintain than a system with 100.    More functions, more objects, and more abstractions.   Often mean more components and code complexity.  Which ultimately means it&#x27;s going to take more brainpower to get anything done. Which is why it takes teams of 100s to maintain large enterprise software projects where the incremental updates change very little even though the engineers working on it are educated well trained people.  <i>shrug</i>",1420089797

8822220,comment,8822062,8822149,0,0,patio11,,,"If you&#x27;re familiar with the Willy Report (Google it), the simplest working theory is that someone figured out a way to award themselves USD/etc balances inside of the Mt. Gox system, purchased large amounts of Bitcoins with them, then transferred them out in the ordinary course of business.  This caused positive improvements in the set of metrics that Gox and the community actively monitored, and the metrics in which the discrepancy would have been obvious were apparently not actively monitored.  (e.g. Comparing the sum of all USD/etc liabilities as reflected in the database with the sum of balances at Mt. Gox&#x27;s single-digit number of bank accounts.)<p>You could call it the most total failure of accounting controls in history, if one had any reason to suspect that Mt. Gox possessed meaningful accounting controls.  There was no reason to suspect this, but many people were willfully blind to that, because it appeared that Bitcoiners were making money hand-over-fist.<p>Edit to add: One reason Gox may not have done the math on the assets vs. liabilities is because they knew they were insolvent from some point in early to mid 2013, as a result of some combination of external events, including the since-reversed freezing of their US bank accounts.  The clearest publicly available evidence of insolvency was persistent unwillingness to allow people to withdraw USD/etc and ludicrous excuses for why this was the case.  (At one point, the CEO alleged that their daily wire volume had overwhelmed the second largest bank in Japan.  This kind of claim is very useful because it is trivially falsifiable.)",1420088723

If we want to follow that spirit, it seems appropriate to ask for tools to help with messy things that now can&#x27;t easily be dealt with.

Treatment for the most common solid tumours remains woefully inadequate, unless you compare it to even more woeful older therapies. Lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, these all remain horrible diseases, that result in an untimely and unpleasant death. We are replacing mortality with expensive morbidity that approaches death asymptotically. This produces a better looking survival curve, but is it actually better?",1420088581

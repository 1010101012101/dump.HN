Rails + ActiveScaffold gets you going very quickly for your standard LOB/CRUD app.<p>For my startup we've chosen Pylons and we're happy so far.  It's definitely not as polished as Rails but it gives us a lot more flexibility.  We're using SQLAlchemy as well and there's no better way to talk to a database.

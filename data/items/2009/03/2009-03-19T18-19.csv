523794,comment,523435,523669,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I've spoken to him over email before. He comes across as a pretty good guy, unlike the perception I had of him from his writings. His article about understanding statistics should be required reading for any good programmer. It's a pity that he decided to focus his efforts elsewhere (e.g., not Ruby/Rails) about a year ago.<p>I've worked with people before that have his ""blog"" personality (for lack of a better description) but in real life. Most of the time these are really smart people, and they are difficult on others because there are a lot of stupid ideas out there. One way of ensuring you filter out the crap is to shut the door on everything. The good stuff will knock again. I had a boss that called a lot of things I suggested stupid. So when I had to fight to implement an idea, and I was adamant about it, he knew that it probably wasn't stupid, and let me go ahead. Think of it as being skeptical, assertive, and intimidating. In the end, about half of my ideas got implemented. The other half I ended up being glad were not implemented, usually about a year after the decision. He'd been correct, and made me look better by keeping me from making a mistake.<p>It's a lot like picking up girls at a bar. The good ones are hit on so many times that their gut instinct is to shut you down immediately if you approach them. You need to be persistent and stand your ground in order to win them over. Most guys will cower and retreat at the first sign of rejection. The ones that get a girl's number are the ones that know how to stay and do battle, so to speak.<p>Zed shows that he's willing to think about issues long term. Most people would simply live with and forget about what they wrote in that rant. Zed goes and makes an update to it saying that he wants to retract what he said. I think that's an admirable trait.",1237489075
523792,comment,523280,523536,0,0,jamwt,,,"CherryPy is a hugely underappreciated project in the Python community.<p>Its HTTP implementation is top notch, its tool system is a great way to write custom modules, it has excellent WSGI support, and it's just about the fastest HTTP server in Python that takes a thread-based concurrency approach.<p>I was the first engineer hired on a team that built an online survey-research company.  We started using twisted/nevow, but eventually moved to an in-house web framework on written on CherryPy.  Lots of tools have come and gone (mostly, we've rewritten components we found lacking) but CherryPy has never let us down.  We even ended up hiring a large portion of the CherryPy team.<p>Our experiences with it were positive enough that I'm building a startup right now on a similar CherryPy-based stack (at least partially--there's also a bit of Erlang involved for the high-concurrency stuff).<p>If you're considering stitching together your own Python Web framework--as many shops eventually do--I highly recommend CherryPy be used as the foundation.",1237489042

He doesn't actually start businesses himself, just has half a dozen brilliant ideas before breakfast, finds the right person to implement those ideas and gives that person the idea (and the crucially missing connections to make it happen, etc).

They're almost all offering the same (aged) feature set.

523786,comment,523108,523108,0,0,misterbwong,,,"I've worked almost exclusively as a webforms programmer for the last few years and transitioning to this over the last month has been surprisingly challenging for me.  I'm definitely a newbie to the ""real"" web and I never knew how much of the web webforms actually hid from me.<p>Despite the difficulties, I've been encouraged by the flexibility of MVC and am thinking about making it my framework of choice for my coming projects.<p>IMO, the best bits of MVC are:<p>-Separation of concerns.  No more mixing business logic with the presentation (""view"") layer.  I can swap out layers of my architecture more easily<p>-More control over page elements.  I always found the ASP.NET controls a bit lacking...<p>-Leaner apps.  I understand that this is mostly the developer's fault as there's always a way to do things better, but most of the apps I've seen written in webforms just feel bloated.  There's too much cruft built into and around webforms to make it seem desktop-y<p>-Better support for TDD.  I've not used this part of it yet, but the MVC model does lend itself to TDD much better than webforms.<p>I'm not saying that WebForms will be completely gone from my development cycle, though.  It is still good for many things.  I think the most glaring benefits are:<p>-Rapid development for internal/quickie apps. This may just be my experience and familiarity talking but it's very easy to throw up a quick and dirty app with webforms.  Great for internal projects.<p>-Legacy applications. This benefit will fade over time, but I was hearing that there were problems with MVC on II6.  Also, I don't believe it's supported on any version below II6.",1237488781

Having to deal with hundreds of subscriptions to websites/services is just not going to fly with your average consumer. I highly suspect what will happen is that your ISP will negotiate with websites/services and offer up bundled tiered Internet packages like they do with cable TV. Should that prove to be successful, that will mean the end of the world wide web as we know it. Then again, that may not be saying much as the world wide web as I know it today is not the same one that I knew even 5 years ago.",1237486861

523701,comment,521634,521905,0,0,cameldrv,,,"The thing is, a lot of places you might want to go have a small airport and roads, but not cab service.  You have to be a decent sized city to have cab service.  One of the cool things about flying around in small airplanes is that you can visit some of these out of the way places.  The current way people deal with this is usually folding bikes, and now there are some folding electric bikes, which are a reasonable alternative to the terrafugia.<p>The real problem with the Terafugia of course is that it's not a very good airplane or a very good car.  On the airplane side, it has very poor payload -- you can't even fill the tanks, and put two average sized people in it with no luggage.  Also, even with full tanks, it has a practical range of only about 250 miles.  If you're willing to make short hops, theoretically you could get somewhere further, but I'm not sure if it's compatible with (leaded) aviation gasoline.  If not, then you have to land, drive to a gas station, drive back to the airport, and take off every 2.5 hours.  At that point, from a speed standpoint, you're better off driving.<p>Still, this is a good start, and if they can improve the pertinent specs by about 20%, I think they will have a real winner.",1237485931

Coming from conventional ASP.NET over to ASP.NET MVC should be a breath of fresh air. No more having to program on a platform that tried (and IMHO failed) at making web development be more desktop-development-like.<p>I've already decided against doing ASP.NET development on my own projects, but if I were forced to use ASP.NET, I wouldn't think twice about choosing the MVC version over the conventional one.

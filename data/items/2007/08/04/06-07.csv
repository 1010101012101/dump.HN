""After all, people have managed to learn how not to put everything they see in their mouth, learned how to stop on red and go on green... They'll learn not to drop viruses on their desktops.""<p>ummm way easier said than done given the stats and me watching my mom's generation use computers... not to mention how it's a lot harder building something stable and secure as opposed to trying to break it (not to mention MS's general failure at building good stuff)<p>""Do not point your finger at .NET, it is still a subset of Win32. It is built mostly on top of Win32, and it is still not available for us to use! Yes, .NET runtime is not part of the most popular Desktop out there - Windows XP.""<p>This didn't happen out of stupidity, MS wanted to bundled it. What stopped it was a thing called an anti-trust lawsuit... (.NET was made to kill Java)",1186210281

39263,comment,39259,39259,0,0,henning,,,"If your app is highly data-driven, the default answer for what programming model to use is now ""web application"", barring special circumstances (e.g., you absolutely need to have computationally intense stuff like 3D graphics or machine learning).<p>Common installation packages, the ones that tell you to shut down everything else and make you click next 50 times just to install one little app, suck and could be improved.<p>I don't see how this corresponds to ""the desktop is dead"".<p>If your badass uber-leet Ajax app takes 20+ seconds to load, uses up 80-140+ MB of RAM, feels slow on a Pentium 4 machine, does less than an Apple IIe app, and could go down at any time leaving you totally helpless (as happened the other day in spite of the high-speed ""backup"" systems those high-profile Web 2.0 sites allegedly had), you have failed. Deal with it.<p>You can use simple reality checks here. If your clunky ""rich text"" editing widget thingie is crippled in ways Notepad is not, you have failed. If your spreadsheet app is maddeningly frustrating to use for more than 100 rows or if you know any keyboard shortcuts at all, you have failed. And so forth.",1186209648

I know Apple stripped out a bunch of stuff that wasn't needed by their apps in a software update, but people are still installing 3rd party stuff on it.  <p>They could have started an arms race with the iPhone hackers with their first update, but they didn't really do anything other than force people with hacks to wipe their phone because the OS wasn't image wasn't in a known state.  With any luck, that's all they'll continue to do.  We'll have to wait and see.  AT&T might be a cranky partner.",1186209461

Go out and look at real political discourse, and tell me that, well, almost <i>any</i> political term is actually well-defined in practice.

People slinging the term like an insult, people wrapping themselves in the term to score political points, academics deconstructing the term for fun. See also: denotation vs. connotation<p>Heck, I'll even cut you a break and let you just use the discourse that appears in those gloriously-editor-mediated ""major media outlets"" without having to muck about with the <i>hoi polloi</i> that wouldn't know what the OED was if you (laboriously) hit them with it; it's still the same result.<p>""What's the point of discussing silly made-up rights""<p>Well, to take one silly made-up right that has been the topic of much recent political discourse, there's the ""right to healthcare"" that has been making the rounds, which certainly can't be found in the Constitution or any discussion of rights of any significant age (such as the classic discourse of the Founding Fathers or Enlightenment philosophers), unless you squint <i>really, really</i> hard.<p>And, if you feel that isn't a silly, made-up right, well, I'm sure you can manage to find someone who will say ""the right to pursue a career unfettered by non-gender-fair obligations like childbirthing"" isn't either. ""Right"" has been ill-defined for a long time; it fits right in to that list I gave above.

Low-carb dieters frequently report that the first two or three days of the diet are very rough days due to low-energy, but then they bounce back and feel much better, often reporting that they feel better than before. (Self-reporting caveat here, of course. Note that I have heard real people say this in real life, though, not just diet books making the claim, though of course placebo may be in play.) My point here is not that the self-reports should be ""trusted"", for some value of ""trusted"", but that there's already anecdotal experience that indicates that the timeframe matters, which I would consider enough experience that investigation across more than just the ""short term"" is fully warranted. I read the abstract carefully and all it says for the time-frame is ""short-term"".<p>In terms of trying to help me understand my diet choices scientifically, this isn't any help, as it doesn't bring any new information in (and then, if I am correct about the timeframe, over-interprets the results).

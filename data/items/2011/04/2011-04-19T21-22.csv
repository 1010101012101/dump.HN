Technically. It certainly lacks most of the usual properties we associate with hash functions but the bare skeleton is sort of there. And there's no way to feasibly reverse that hash function algorithmically short of keeping the original input table and querying that, which is how Bit.ly of course works.",1303250381

Browsers like Internet Explorer and Safari support the majority of all web video, right out of the box, no plug-ins needed. On mobile devices, the situation is even more obvious. Android is the only OS with support for WebM, and no mobile devices have hardware acceleration for WebM, draining your device's battery in no-time.

In jQuery, this is more compactly written:<p><pre><code>  tds = $('.blah > td')

But some places already have an web-based system for this, with no need for a separate app. Still, I guess the app-based idea might make life slightly easier -- just show the screen of your phone to pick up your order.",1303246846

BART is rather unusual by combining what is in some places almost commuter-rail station spacing with full grade separation ($$$), but it&#x27;s still best when running more high-demand, high-frequency service. I wouldn&#x27;t expect local SJ-SF BART service to be a lot faster than local Caltrain - faster acceleration would help a bit, but at that stop spacing it&#x27;s not a huge factor.<p>In the long term there would definitely be utility for round-the-bay BART service, but right now Caltrain provides way better nortbound service than San Jose-East Bay connections, so that extension does make more sense for having more priority. With any luck, Caltrain electrification driven by the HSR project might happen before Santa Clara gets around to funding BART to Mountain View, further reducing the need.",1381042089

Perhaps some of the &quot;problems&quot; we&#x27;re explained away in the other 85 minutes?<p>SPOILER ALERT<p>Problem 1: debris - The debris were created after the space walk started by a chain of collisions began by a Russian anti-satellite weapon. So they could would not know to abort the spacewalk before it began.<p>Problem 2: Clooney&#x27;s jetpack - The movie explains that he is testing an experimental jetpack that has very long duration. He could apparently set a spacewalk duration record while fly around almost continuously. Maybe this is impossible but the move seem to take place in the future, there is a Chinese space station, and/or alternate reality, the Space Shuttle still flies.<p>Problem 3: Clooney&#x27;s Superman impersonation - As explained above this was a more advance jetpack than ever actually used by NASA.<p>Problem 4: Clooney&#x27;s rescue attempt - Again the advance jetpack means it would make sense for her to rescue her.<p>The BIIIIIIG problem 5: From HST to ISS - Since it is an alternate and/or future world there is no reason orbits have to as they are today. It may even make sense to have the HST in a close orbit to IIS to make repairs such as this.

Finance is what drives pretty much all modern economic activity around the world, and the fundamental concepts in finance haven&#x27;t changed for hundreds of years, which takes care of both the stable/slow-changing and in demand criteria. It is also heavily mathematical if you choose to focus on the quant side, with probability, statistics, stochastic calculus,  PDE&#x27;s, and even measure theory being used in some form. Also, software is becoming an increasingly important part of modern finance, with things like electronic exchanges, high frequency trading, complex derivative/option pricing, prop trading, and actuarial science.<p>And the skills you&#x27;ll learn in finance will be transferable to a range of other fields - advertising and cloud distribution, which pretty much drive most tech startups&#x27; revenue, heavily rely on concepts and techniques that you&#x27;ll learn in finance.<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting course you can take a look at: <a href=""http://www.algorithm.cs.sunysb.edu/computationalfinance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.algorithm.cs.sunysb.edu/computationalfinance/</a>\nNote that this is by steven skiena, the author of the well-known Alogrithmm Design Manual.

6503348,comment,6503176,6503244,3,0,dxhdr,,,"Very inaccurate and misleading. You&#x27;re confusing learning an API (easy) with doing actual graphics programming. Graphics programming involves deep understanding of the target hardware. The level of sophistication of the hardware determines which graphics techniques to pursue for the best results. Often it&#x27;s a balance of your ability to optimize along with achieving the highest fidelity of output.<p>For example, availability of floating point render targets -- how do you use them, and for what? How does the hardware handle them? It&#x27;s different across devices even in the same generation! How does the hardware optimize rendering of opaque vs transparent objects? It&#x27;s different across devices. Let&#x27;s get really specific -- how many cycles does a medium precision square root take? Do you use pow or not? How much does a texture lookup cost? Hopefully you can guess the answer by now -- it&#x27;s different on every device.<p>It gets exciting when a blend of API and hardware (which includes additional supported and unsupported extensions, which yes, also change with every OS/hardware combination) requires the invention of a novel technique to fully utilize the resources at hand. It&#x27;s a continual balancing act of visual fidelity and performance with the end goal of squeezing out every last bit of memory and computational bandwidth.<p>Enough about hardware which is really just an important detail of the field. Being a great graphics programmer requires keeping up to date with the community of blogs and published papers, all of which are a constantly updating source of experimentation and novel techniques. This doesn&#x27;t even touch on the artistry involved. Being at the top of the field takes extreme dedication and is absolutely not a &quot;learn once and refresh now and then&quot; activity.<p>Summary: real-time graphics programming is one of -the- most difficult fields to stay at the forefront.",1381040620

There are several possibilities here:<p>1. Perhaps the NSA helped with finding the server by traffic analysis to follow the circuit back to the hidden service IP?<p>2.

Virtualization Technology (both at the System and Network Layers) used in in conjunction with Optical Fiber Technology is evolving the underlying Infrastructure of the Internet to be faster, more resilient, and more intelligent. The concept of an Application Programming Interface (API) used in conjunction with Cloud Based Methodologies towards Service Delivery are potentially laying the groundwork for a true Semantic Web (Web 3.0) as described by Tim Berners-Lee (in my opinion anyway). These are just a few short examples of converging Technology that will create amazing new possibilities. The Internet of things is on the way, and it won&#x27;t stop there. I believe that many of these new capabilities will revolutionize other aspects of Life, such as Healthcare and Education.

Until the mid-&#x27;70s homosexuality was listed among the phony mental illnesses, finally removed after much pressure was put on the practitioners of this pseudoscience.<p>> The science on this is very strong.<p>The science of this is practically nonexistent. Are you aware that the director of the NIMH, the highest-ranking psychiatrist in the country, has recently decided to pull the plug on the DSM, describing it as too unscientific to be useful? And that, by pulling the plug on psychiatry&#x27;s &quot;Bible&quot;, he pulled the plug on psychiatry&#x27;s dubious standing as a science?<p>> The problems these disorders cause the individual are very real and unmistakeably negative.<p>No more real than the average placebo response, which as time passes is becoming the default assumption that must be taken into account and that cannot be categorically eliminated until science eventually enters the field.<p>There is a core of very serious cases, like schizophrenia and some bipolar sufferers, but those are not mental illnesses, they are physical ailments with psychological symptoms. Purely mental illnesses have no scientific explanation, no reliable diagnostic criteria, and no treatments -- which is why the DSM is being abandoned.<p>> Sometimes conspiracy nuts equate mental disorders with some kind of &quot;dissident&quot; behavior that has to be censors.<p>You mean, like the editor of DSM-IV, now a critic of the mental health field, who has just written a book arguing that the epidemic of overdiagnosis collides with natural diversity? Like that? Are you aware that nature thrives on a wide spectrum of behaviors, that such a spectrum represents the genesis of all future improvements in the species?<p>&quot;Saving Normal&quot; (Allen Frances): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Normal-Out-Control-Medicalization/dp/0062229257"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Normal-Out-Control-Medicalizati...</a><p>NIMH director Insel: <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>Quote: &quot;While DSM has been described as a “Bible” for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each.

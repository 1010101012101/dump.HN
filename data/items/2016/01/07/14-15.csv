I had become tired of the dearth of issues that crop up to maintain an Arch desktop distribution.<p>While the privacy collection issues should be addressed and be transparent to end-users I think open source is not the way to go for these devices. I&#x27;m tired of each device being an island. I like handing off calls from my phone to my laptop when I&#x27;m at work. It began frustrating me years ago when I couldn&#x27;t just flick a few files off of my e-reader to a friend&#x27;s phone despite the prevalence of available networks.<p>Open-source, meanwhile, has struggled to provide a basic desktop environment to rival the best from five years ago. It&#x27;s simply too much work without a paid, focused, and highly-skilled product team consisting of more than just developers. And they&#x27;re still fighting the chicken-and-egg problem of user-adoption.<p>I don&#x27;t like the spyware &quot;features,&quot; but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back to Linux any time soon and giving up all the great software I&#x27;ve come to depend on.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful that people will find ways to invest in its development and find a way to introduce a competing product that is both secure, in the control of the user, and a delight to use -- able to integrate with a plethora of devices and, for the most part, <i>just work</i>.",1452178767

To justify their actions I think Korean society was portrayed as &quot;less civilized&quot; which is more a statement about cultural and political norms than race, although those portrayals can probably slip into a racist ideology pretty quickly.<p>It seems like the &quot;official&quot; policy was different, at least: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Equality_Proposal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Equality_Proposal</a><p>I&#x27;m not trying to portray devil&#x27;s advocate at all, just actually asking whether what the article portrays is accurate.

I&#x27;ll refrain from listing all of the very obvious reasons why your word on Linode should be taken with a grain of salt at the very least.<p>2) Being able to blame Linode for your own data breach is a fantastically easy (although lazy) way to pacify customers about the fact that their personal data was just pilfered by someone on your watch.<p>All that being said, what have you presented that can be proven? All that can be proven is that you&#x27;re an ex Linode employee. Everything else is hot air that we&#x27;re all meant to take your word. Tons of appeal to authority in your explanations. You keep invoking some mysterious third party &quot;expert&quot; security group who conveniently agrees with everything your own company &quot;discovered.&quot; If you were actually confident in your own abilities and that of your team members, there wouldn&#x27;t be an immediate appeal following every attempted assertion.<p>Plus, even if you really did hire someone, what company isn&#x27;t going to just say &quot;yes&quot; and agree to whatever PR campaign their customer is saying while dumping wheelbarrows of cash into their pockets? Frankly I don&#x27;t believe you, and I find your consistent drumming against Linode to be highly suspicious in the wake of these attacks. You&#x27;re not involved, are you?<p>The Linode post you&#x27;re referring to is just saying that they expired everyone&#x27;s passwords.

I read books, I highlited the words I wanted to learn and once or twice a week I wrote them up in a small book. After a while a wrote a small VBA flashcard app for tracking my progress and randomizing the words. And that took a hell lot of time. With an app like yours I could have saved 30-60 minutes every week (2-4 hours every month) which is worth of 20-40€ a month (on minimum wage). That´s why a recommend you to spend way much more time marketing your app and finding the right customers, which means:<p>- already learning languages (don´t get fooled by &quot;If I had enough time, I would use it&quot;)<p>- learning languages because they have to (living abroad or working international)<p>- saving 2-4 (or more) hours a month is worth them at least 10€ (no students spending more money on boose than on books)<p>IMHO you can find a lot of young professionals on forums like the &quot;new in wahetever city&quot; groups or expat groups in facebook.<p>Good Luck!",1452178166

A huge problem with language learning is that unless you have moved to another country or otherwise in an immersive environment then it becomes quite difficult to keep motivation and discipline high. The reward of &quot;I can read/write/speak/listen a little better than last month&quot; starts to pale and people realize they actually don&#x27;t use their new skill on a regular basis.

This is a sideshow compared to the real problem. IPv6 is profoundly different in <i>all sorts of ways</i>. Yes, if you just want to open a TCP connection to a remote system you can use an IPv6 address instead of an IPv4 address and the resulting socket is <i>usually</i> essentially identical (it isn&#x27;t necessarily but the differences often don&#x27;t matter for the simple common case), but <i>almost everything else changes</i>. &quot;DHCP&quot; changes. Vast new rules about all the classes of IPv6 addresses, and all network hardware needs to implement <i>new</i> code to handle all that. IPv6 addresses are <i>much</i> more complicated than IPv4 addresses.<p>In fact probably most of the people reading this only <i>think</i> they know what an IPv6 address is... based on my experience with people who think they know what IPv6 is, most are wrong. Do you know what the &quot;link local&quot; portion of the address is off the top of your head? Do you know what an % sign in the IPv6 address signifies? (This being HN, of course a few thousand of you do; you don&#x27;t need to prove that in a reply. But I bet the majority of people reading this do not.)<p>Just look at this page: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address</a><p>By contrast, I can&#x27;t link you to the &quot;Wikipedia page on IPv4 addresses&quot;, because <i>it doesn&#x27;t rate its own page</i>. It just gets rolled into a single section on the IPv4 page in general: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Addressing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Addressing</a><p>And that&#x27;s <i>just</i> addresses. There&#x27;s huge swathes of other changes that require huge amounts of new code to be added to all network devices.<p>IPv6 isn&#x27;t a failure (inasmuch as we really should have been done by now) because it requires a total upgrade of all network devices. Probably the vast bulk of critical devices have been upgraded in the time since IPv6 was first standardized. IPv6 was a failure because it also immensely complicated the network protocol and code did not just have to be &quot;slightly modified&quot; to work, but torn down and replaced with a much larger and more complicated chunk of code. IPv6 is <i>not</i> &quot;just&quot; IPv4 with bigger addresses. IPv6 doesn&#x27;t fail to interoperate with IPv4 because of trivial networking issues, IPv6 fails to interoperate with IPv4 because it&#x27;s a <i>wildly different network stack</i> that happens to offer similar enough TCP-like abstractions that user-level code often is only slightly affected, but everything else in the stack is profoundly affected.<p>The advantage of the &quot;just extend it&quot; plan is that it <i>would</i> have been that easy. Perhaps a judicious application of a few solutions to the worst IPv4 problems could have been added.  But IPv6 is the technical equivalent of an appropriations bill in the US Congress. We have to do this, so let&#x27;s take this opportunity to stuff every wish-list item in there we can. We didn&#x27;t have to do <i>that</i>.<p>In a way, the article does a better job <i>defending</i> DJB&#x27;s thesis than attacking it, precisely by pointing out that DJB&#x27;s plan would have been relatively easy and feasible....",1452176057

Then if you modified it, Copy On Write would kick in, even though there was only one reference living. This was the source of crippling inefficiency in production code.

How is the site different from greatschools.com or school-data.com? What are my benefits for signing up?<p>So, layout and the value proposition is one thing. The second problem is content. I realize this is a chicken and egg problem, but if I were to stumble upon the site I'm not inclined to subscribe. The reason: the site is as good as empty! You need to fill it with reviews: rally up classmates, facebook friends, family to subscribe and review their schools. You could use Amazon Mechanical Turk too, and pay people to write a review. You say you're getting traffic, and with your improved site with the initial reviews, your chances of getting actual users have increased.<p>Building a site is relatively easy.

Hey, I must be confused about how much glass is needed to make a useful weapon.  I have seen plenty of glass that a clever terrorist might steal from restaurants at small regional airports as well.  As for knives, any knife that is sharp enough to cut a steak is sharp enough to be used as a weapon.<p>The thing is, I am not a terrorist.  What I see as potential weapons are probably just the tip of the iceberg of things that can be turned into a weapon.  Prisoners manage to make weapons out of all sorts of seemingly innocuous objects.  What makes you think that the things I can identify as possible weapons are an evenly remotely exhaustive list?  What makes you think that a terrorist could not find more weapons on the other side of security?",1362952337

The cost of living there makes it a complete non-starter if you're not just wanting to work full time - and then trying to eek out a pleasurable life at the weekends.<p>I currently contract 3 days a week to support myself while working on my startup and trying to fit in some time for music as well in the other 4 days (and try to get relaxation each week too).  The money I make wouldn't last very long in Sydney or any world city for that matter, I guess that's where the VC is supposed to kick in, but if it doesn't then you're in trouble.<p>If it's one thing I've worked out recently, full time, 40 hour week style employment is the enemy of me being able to pursue any sort of interesting side project, I'm sure it's similar for others.  It's a realisation that, now I've had it, I can't imagine ever working under those conditions on anything but my own projects.  High costs of living such as those in SF and Sydney (and even Auckland) can necessitate such income just to live with a modicum of dignity however, and then trap you with dining out at weekends and such, resulting in not actually achieving any progress on the projects that matter most to you.

I would think that the lack of K-9 teams near departure gates is a good sign that bombings are not the concern of the TSA when it comes to airport security.  Bombings are probably a concern somewhere, but the security checkpoints do not seem to do much when it comes to stopping a bomb plot.<p>Keep in mind that private planes are exempt from the security checks.  If a terrorist wanted to blow up a commercial plane, what would stop them from chartering a private jet, bringing bombs on board, and then ramming their explosive-laden plane into an airliner mid-flight?  Why even bother doing it in flight?  A terrorist might just roll their chartered jet into a fully-loaded passenger plane on the runway, and blow up a plane in front of a crowd of people.<p>Perhaps there is some other procedure in place to ensure that no bombs can make it past the numerous ways that people and vehicles can enter an airport without going through a security checkpoint.  If that is the case, what is the purpose of the checkpoint?  Why not just apply whatever techniques prevent terrorists from ramming private jets into airliners to the rest of the airport, and let us keep our rights intact?<p>It is also worth pointing out that there are lots of other bombing targets that are not being bombed, despite a <i>complete</i> lack of security.  Anyone can bring large packages onto the NYC subways without any harassment or scanning, yet those trains (which are packed with hundreds of people during the rush hour) have not been blown up.  A truck full of explosives could easily drive onto a major bridge.  Yet despite these clear vulnerabilities, and despite the fact that other countries see such attacks and more, we rarely have them here.  Are airlines really more special targets for bombers than urban transit systems?",1362950736

That chipset, when combined with an NVIDIA video card, would make X crash and lock up after about 30 minutes of use (before you start bashing on Linux, I'd been told the same thing would happen on Windows with this hardware combination).  For six months months I was in denial of this problem.  I kept thinking the next BIOS update or the next driver would fix the problem.  In the meantime I used nothing but console mode, because it was the only thing that was stable.<p>Six months or so later I sold the old motherboard, paid my quarter to get myself a ""real motherboard"" (ok, it was more like USD$200), and got X working again.

Things definitely change as soon as you wish to render a flying ship though.<p>2. Learning has been the main reason for this demo. There's no better way to learn than to take apart or build something from scratch. In fact, I've built a 3D engine as well during this time (not used in this demo at all), along with a 3D model viewer and an application I hope to turn into a start-up some day.

You brought up good examples:<p>""Need more police? Maybe so. What's the crime rate look like""<p>More like, ""I can be tough on crime, so let me fund more cops!""  The crime rate has been declining lately, but the police are more powerful than ever before.  Paramilitary teams are routinely used to serve search-and-arrest warrants, the police can recycle the proceeds of seized property into their own budgets, and there are more and more ways for us to become criminals with each passing year.<p>""Need increased defense spending? I don't know. What's the defense spend of other countries""<p>Once upon a time, we only spent substantial money on the military when we were in a state of war.  Then we began to panic over the USSR's military might, so we created a standing army.  Now there is no USSR and we have the most powerful and well-funded military on Earth.  Despite the changes in other countries' military sizes and budgets, our standing army faces more budget cuts from failures to compromise on the domestic budget than any sort of quantitative comparison with other countries.<p>The thing about the executive branch is that it is constantly trying to get more power, and the legislative branch is constantly giving more power to the executive.  The old protections against executive abuses are being eroded, and new ways for the executive to act without democratic process are being created.  Declare drugs to be illegal without consulting Congress?  Sure.  Shoot and kill American citizens hundreds of miles from any battlefield?  Of course!  Expanded the military presence in countries that never threatened or attacked us?  Why wait for Congress on anything?  The only politicians who are even trying to stop this are outsiders, libertarians and the far-left whose ideas are nowhere near the mainstream.<p>""With the TSA, we're protecting them from something not happening that's only ever happened once in our history.""<p>The issue here is that there was never actually a problem for the TSA to address.  America does not have an ongoing problem with terrorist attacks; every few years we see one very determined attacker manage to cause a lot of destruction, and otherwise we go on with our lives oblivious to the numerous ways we can be attacked.  Other countries are not so fortunate:  they have to deal with terrorists attacking garbage cans, buses, markets, etc.  They can judge their policies by reductions in such attacks.<p>Bruce Schneier has a good point:  instead of an agency meant to secure transportation against rare and unpredictable attacks, we should fund an agency meant to make transportation generally safer.  We have lots of car accidents each year; once upon a time, we addressed that by mandating seatbelts as a standard feature.  Why not continue to develop safer cars?  If we are no longer creative enough to do that, why not spend the money on making alternative modes of transportation easier, cheaper, and more available?  We can determine the success of such a policy by the reduction in vehicle-related injuries and deaths.",1362949666

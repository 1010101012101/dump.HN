Reader was never really a product with much support, it was more a labor of love of a small dedicated team. Reader was not shutdown to ""make way for G+"" anymore than any of the other spring cleaned services were shut down because of competing services.  Even the original (ex-Googler now) Reader engineers have pretty much outlined many of the reasons, including the decline of RSS, which was killed off in large part by people moving to services like Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr.<p>It's really regretable, but it's time to realize that the rest of the world moved on, and if we want federated, open services, it's going to have to built from the ground up, and in a way that users, not hackers, will want to use it.",1366605742

5587751,comment,5586519,5587656,1,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"It's not really a case against IPv6 that existing websites don't need it since that's a privileged position that makes IPv4 seem fine. IPv4 exhaustion is only a problem for individuals at the edge who want incoming calls (to act as servers). Fortunately, today, new edge-homed servers can already use IPv6 through a tunnel, with the immediate advantage that they have a ""real"" globally-routable address that they can be reached at. In that sense, IPv6 has already arrived. It would just be nice if I didn't have to set up that extra tunnel to connect to something that only I and my clients connect to.<p>The people at the edge who don't care are, sadly, the one's who would most benefit. I agree that that is a problem. These social problems (the consumer apathy and the willingness of ISPs to exploit that to make a peer network a broadcast tree) are admittedly overwhelming but, as you also note, the costs to ISPs are minor: IPv6 can be provided to the edge, even if it's ultimately tunneled over IPv4-only hardware.<p>This is more a matter of technology-leaders, IMHO, pushing/expecting ISPs to do the right thing for once (if we can spare a few minutes from selling censorship to dictators). History has shown they aren't going to do it without public pressure. Their preferred distribution medium (cable TV) already existed: it was people who understood that it was a peer network that drove the adoption of the Internet. If IPv6 spends the first 10 years or more being used exclusively by that group of people, fine, but it's still worth promoting. ISPs only started taking it seriously in the last few years, so there's a long way to go, but I think it's a reasonable goal to get an upstream IPv6 router advertisement, eliminating the need for tunnels, to every IPv4-connected home in the next 5 years (it is really just a matter of installing Linux, or your preferred OS, on a spare box until the load dictates an upgrade; there is no chicken-or-egg problem).",1366604402

They created pagerank, which led to better search results. And they used a combination of cutting-edge software techniques (map-reduce, sharded databases) along with cutting-edge datacenter techniques (consumer hardware, massive parallelism, heavy automation). This combination made it possible for google to create a product which was better and superior (more accurate, faster) and cheaper to operate.

The orthodoxy at that time was that there was no money in search. Accordingly nobody wanted to be a search engine and everyone tried to be a portal. The dominant player back then - Yahoo - emphasized its use of human editors and partnered with AltaVista and Inktomi for search.<p>So Google never really defeated a dominant search engine - it merely took advantage of a giant vacuum in the market.<p>2)Apple - Apple never defeated Microsoft in the PC game. Instead it focused on emerging markets: ipod, iphone, ipad. Eventually these new products (smartphones & tablets) became powerful enough to erode the PC market. Even now Microsoft is still dominant in the PC market. It's just that PC is no longer where the action is at.<p>3)Facebook - there were no dominant players in social networking when facebook was founded. Myspace was the biggest player, but ""big"" was a relative term back then. Even at the height of its popularity the vast majority of the population was not Myspace users. Sure if you were 16 year old in 2004 then you were probably on Myspace. but outside of that demo Myspace was far from dominant. Most people were not on any social networks. In short it was a wide open market.<p>I'm sure there are examples where a challenger took on a dominant incumbent head on and won. But those are the edge cases.

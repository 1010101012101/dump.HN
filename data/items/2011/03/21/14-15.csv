Of course it's no silver bullet, but for many of the projects I've worked on in the past it was a good fit.

2350004,comment,2349577,2349810,0,0,cicero,,,"I'll be showing this article to my high school computer science students to try to raise the excitement level among some of them.<p>Programming is hard enough that kids have to be pretty motivated to choose to do it. At our school, Computer Science is an elective at the High School level, and it is more difficult than many of the other courses they could take. Although most of our students think computers are cool, they also think they know all they need to know about computers without having to wrestle with the tediousness of getting the syntax right and figuring out why their programs are locking up.<p>I learned to program as a kid because in the late 70s, that was about the only thing you could do with a computer. I was lazy enough as a teenager that if I had an Xbox 360, iPhone, and other electronic distractions, I might not have bothered.<p>Now I find that I have rather deep knowledge about a technology that permeates our lives today. I would like my students to get excited enough about gaining that kind of knowledge that they will do the hard work it takes to reach such a goal. I think it could help if I put into their imaginations the idea of getting a superpower.",1300719586
2350003,comment,2349387,2349387,0,0,ilamont,,,"Diploma mills and for-profit schools take advantage of the fact that many prospective students assume that accreditation conveys legitimacy and quality, as determined by an official and/or independent authority.<p>Besides the apparently bogus agencies cited in the article about Lorenz, established for-profits control their own national accreditation body, the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS). Another tactic is to latch on to national agencies that have traditionally served vocational schools and community colleges, such as the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP). This is how the University of Phoenix has accredited its MBA and DBA programs.<p>Regional agencies are regarded as the gold standard in the United States, but the for-profits figured out a way to game that system, too: Buy out small, struggling non-profit colleges that have regional accreditation, and then replace the old curriculum and mission with scalable, high-profit online programs. The regional accreditation transfers, although there's no guarantee it will be renewed the next time it is reviewed.<p>One well-known example involved an obscure Catholic school in Iowa with 312 students known as Franciscan University of the Prairies. It was bought in 2005 by Bridgepoint Education, renamed ""Ashford University"", and turned into an online university with 42,000 students. It was nevertheless able to keep its regional accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, although it is apparently trying to transfer accreditation to the Western Association of Schools and Colleges -- the same body that has accredited Stanford, the UC and California State systems, etc.<p>For more information about the for-profit higher education phenomenon in the U.S., I recommend the following Frontline special, ""College Inc."":<p><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/collegeinc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/collegeinc/</a>",1300719582

We need to elect politicians like Ron Paul who oppose big government intrusions into our privacy. This country is supposed to be a bastion of liberty and we go to war to ""protect freedom"" and ""democracy"" and yet we are less and less free every day. When we see articles about Chinese ""human rights abuses"" many are quick to condemn them and other countries perceived as less free than ourselves. Yet I have observed that the US has been headed in a very totalitarian direction for at least the past decade while China has been headed the opposite way, towards more and more freedom. Yes, the Chinese have filtered Internet today, but in the last century they've moved from Feudalism to Communism to a mixed economy. We have gone from having the most freedom in the world to having a Department of Homeland Security, TSA, NSA, Patriot Act, full-body X-Rays, and country-tapping.",1300719327

Unix was something heard of but not seen.  There was no internet (for starving students).  The only sanely priced own-it-yourself computing platform was IBM-PC (clone).  I bought a used Sanyo MBC-775.  I scrimped to afford the Borland and MS C compilers w/student discount.  The Borland IDE was nice, but the MS compiler seemed qualitatively better.  And the MSC package had this powerful text editor M.  It had almost no UI, but with its ""reverse polish"" command syntax, box, stream and line selection modes with commands accepting all arg types, I found it tremendously intuitive,  Completely customizable key assignments.  A macro language.  Unlimited undo/redo.  It could edit files > 640K (Borland's could not).  The manual was well done for those days, and included an API and build process for ""editor extensions"" (basically DLL's before there were DLL's), which I was soon writing.  I was hooked.  My brain-finger editor mapping was soon cast for life.  Shortly MS replaced M with PWB, which I tried but discarded (bloatware), sticking with M.  Years pass, during which I wrote a M clone, now a Win32 console app.  Which I use today.  While I'm fond of unix (use it for servers at home), all of my employers have been Microsoft-only shops, so my investment in developing my own text editor, which I can change as my needs require, has been worthwhile.  Editor vendors in this market have come and gone (Brief, Codewright to name a few of the more popular), and their users have been disrupted.  I just ""keep on truckin"" with my own...  If the need arises, maybe I'll port to Linux/BSD.",1300718127

If you're savvy, it can save you time. Women have more options, but they also have more to sift through. Men can be incredibly efficient by comparison, just because we have less to go through and the good stuff is easier to spot.<p>In the last year I managed to transform my wardrobe from jeans + threadless shirts to strictly dress clothes, but without looking conventional about it or spending a lot.

I don't spend more than 5 minutes (you learn to be efficient pretty quickly). I look at dress shirts, pants, jackets, and ties. Nothing else. I may not find anything, but I feel good when I do ($5-10/shirt, heck yes!). I've found several great shirts that would be $60+ new, and a couple really sweet blazers too.<p>Then I hit somewhere like Winners, reasonably stylish but not so expensive. When I find something I think I like, I ask myself a couple questions:<p>a) Does it look like a ""dad"" shirt/pant?\nb) Would a teenager wear it?<p>Both are deal-breakers. If I'm really unsure if it's too loud, I'll try it anyway. But be strict on fit. Dress shirts that look like a garbage bag wrapped around your waist are terrible. Of course, you have to tweak to your physical size, but you can find things that flatter. If it doesn't flatter, even if it's nice, put it back (even if it's ""your size"").<p>And for the first while, have a woman come with you, but tell her what you're going for.

Back in the days when most of us were stuck on dialup, they were charging $0.18 a megabyte. At least the slow speeds limited the damage, though downloading a 600MB would still have cost a ridiculous $108. Meanwhile the rest of the world hadn't even though of charing such tariffs for internet usage. Of course once you have one company setting the standard then their competitors all follow suite.<p>While things have improved tremendously since then, broadband plans are still based around download and sometimes even upload usage. At least now you're looking at something more reasonable like $50/month for 50 gigabytes a month of included download usage. So originally caching would actually save you serious money (unfortunately ISPs rarely passed on these savings to customers if they used their proxy server).

Now parallelize that problem over about a hundred thousand people.)<p>Thinking the radiation has future higher expected harm than the tsunami is pretty much solely a problem of cognitive biases.",1300716124

Most of us belong to some kind of ""minority"" in some fashion, sometimes it's visible from the outside, sometimes not. Are things in the USA really so bad that it matters what color your skin is? Isn't tech a business of ideas anyway?",1300716087

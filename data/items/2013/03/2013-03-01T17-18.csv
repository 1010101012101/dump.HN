5305783,comment,5303808,5305479,2,0,fennecfoxen,,,"The difference between programming and VFX is that you don't need to do maintenance programming on the finished result of a VFX project. Once you've rendered a movie scene, that's it: either it looks good, or it looks lousy. Cheaply-built software (from India or otherwise) may look okay, but fall apart under its own weight; visual effects don't have that class of problem (or to the extent they do, it is a much smaller or less-frequent problem).<p>If American VFX artists successfully unionize and attempt to charge higher prices for VFX work, you can expect to see more outsourcing of labor-intensive VFX to cheaper, nonunion VFX shops, many of which will be outside of the US. (Alternatively, some VFX shops will invest in capital projects - in the form of computer systems - that create quality VFX with fewer but more-productive artists.)<p>It may in fact suck to be a VFX artist. There is, however, little that you can expect to do to change this, even if you do unionize. If your life as a VFX artist sucks and your pay is low, you may simply have to pay attention to this price signal, exit the industry, and seek employment elsewhere.<p>Disclaimer.

So maybe you should familiarize yourself with VIM before talking about it - for example I noticed that you wrote that ""[in modern editors] there is no need to wonder in what mode you are"" as if it was a problem in VIM. It's true for vi, but VIM has a mode indicator on a status bar since times immemorial.<p>Second, in VIM there are three modes, that's true, but not the ones you enumerate. There is: insert mode, normal mode and visual mode. All modern editors have at least the last one: the editor (all of them) behaves differently when you have some text selected.<p>Third, in VIM you can freely delete and navigate (with arrows!) in insert mode. No problem at all.

In my code I usually emulate the Python copy-superclass-on-class-creation semantics of subclassing.<p>> its lack of support for proper namespacing and modularity,<p>RequireJS has effectively solved this problem for me. As per above, you should never put things in global scope anyway.<p>> its lack of proper typing,<p>If you're looking for built-in static typing, you came to the wrong place. I think it's important to remember that JavaScript the language was designed to be very minimal (IIRC the entire initial language was created in a week); in that regard, it at the very least is not a good fit for static typing.

The parent has now removed the sentence.]<p>We (the people using Python for Scientific Computing) like Python for the following reasons:<p>1. Numpy+Scipy+matplotlib+cvxopt is a very speedy environment. Its only real competitor for what it provides is MatLab. I have a colleague who bench marked Python vs. Matlab for <i>our</i> workload. Python is faster. (often because some of the algorithms used are newer than the equivalents in Matlab.)<p>2. It is a very productive environment. We do a lot of evolutionary changes and prototyping. Doing in this in C would slow us down in dev. time. This is academic work and mostly the code isn't important the analysis is.<p>3. We generally know where the ""hot loops"" are. Which is what we focus on for optimization. This generally involves doing math on paper. Then implementing it. If you turn loops in to matrix multiplications and use a good matrix library you get a great speed up.",1362159739

Here are some examples:<p>* iOS to Android Ports. You have an iOS app that you would like to port to Android. I can take the existing iOS experience, make it conform to Android standards and deliver a polished high-quality app.<p>* Web Apps. You have a mobile site that you want to convert to an app. I can take the web content and create an app using an existing solution like PhoneGap or a custom web wrapper. We can go one step further and create a hybrid app that combine the best of the web and native worlds to fully leverage all the capabilities of the mobile device.<p>* App Rescue and Optimization. You have an Android app that isn't quite performing. Perhaps it crashes, it's slow or has other problems. I can take a look, diagnose the issues and fix them.<p>* SDKs. You have some awesome functionality that you'd like developers to use in their apps. I can put together an SDK or library that lets developers easily do that.<p>* Strategy. Need advice on how to best approach Android development? Perhaps you are wondering what features your app should have to be successful? Or you have concerns about how to best approach testing on the myriad of Android devices? I can put together a plan that addresses issues like these and many more.<p>Want to know more about my work?

It's easier to drive an automatic, why do professional drivers switch gears manually? Because learning the more advanced interface gives them more control over the way the machine behaves, and in their use case, the investment in learning it pays off handsomely in the added power later.

Modern editors are mode-free, meaning (don't faint) you don't have to change modes to insert, delete and navigate. These editors don't need ""cheat sheets"" to help you figure out how to switch modes and navigate, <i>because you don't have to cheat.</i><p>Vi/vim is the oldest editor still commonly available. I used it in the 1970s when I worked for NASA, on a ""paper terminal"". In that environment, its quirks made sense because they saved paper. Since then, it has been completely superseded by newer, better programs.<p>Even my now-ancient program Apple Writer (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer</a>) was easier to use, largely because my program addressed and solved some of vi's more annoying problems. There's a reason Apple Writer became a best-seller -- one of them was that fact that, by eliminating modes, it represented a huge improvement over existing editors, including vi.<p>But that was the early 1980s. If I had been told then that I would still be trying to get people to use more efficient editors over 30 years, later I would have laughed -- impossible!",1362158932

Most special effects-laden movies have a few CGI shots that just look awful. And you would think that VFX would be steadily improving in quality, but while we often see more impressive results in terms of what can be done the accuracy of them isn't always holding up and the realism and reliability isn't improving at the same rate that technology and new techniques are.<p>This could end up with Hollywood shooting themselves in the foot. Movies are getting more and more CGI, but CGI that breaks the suspension of disbelief can really ruin a movie.<p>A lot of people complained about the VFX in Wolverine, for instance, but shouldn't the VFX in that have been better than the X-men triology? Well, when you have seventeen different companies doing VFX shots for a movie, you're going to get uneven results. There was some really good VFX in Wolverine, but there was some really bad stuff too, and I'd have to believe the studio going cheap is what led to it.",1362158148

If this were the case, CEOs would never get fired and replaced by outsiders. And if this were the case, CEOs wouldn't drive companies into the ground.<p>But this isn't the case. CEOs are just like everyone else. Some of them have bad ideas. Some of them make gambles that don't pay off. Some of them don't really understand their competitors that well.<p>I'm not making a judgement as to Mayer's ability to run Yahoo, but the idea that an outsider can't have good suggestions for a company and CEO is crazy. Yes, a lot of people in the tech press like to make recommendations to companies that aren't well thought out and are perhaps done for linkbait reasons, but there is a lot of data on the merits of remote work, especially when done part time. I don't see any harm in pointing that out, and a debate about working environments and work-life balance is important.<p>Mayer is not like most employees. Most people can't afford to hire help and to have a nursery built next to their office at work. She can, and she doesn't have to deal with the same issues that most of her employees do.<p>Saying that we can't have a debate about this because we're not the CEO of Yahoo is crazy.",1362157587

Tidemark Systems (<a href=""http://www.tidemark.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tidemark.net</a>, note "".net"") is hiring.<p>Like everybody else in the industry, we're finding hiring to be a difficult problem. For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of. But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do. So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great. But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS. You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience. If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code. This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job. This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.<p>Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound. The company is well-funded and we have people with decades of experience in the field.<p>If this position sounds interesting, my email is on my profile page.",1362157585

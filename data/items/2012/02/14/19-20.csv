3591505,comment,3591475,3591475,1,0,corticotropic,,,"The British Medical Association is currently proposing a change from an opt-in system for organ donation to one requiring an explicit opt-out for those citizens who do not want to donate. This would all be fine if the UK didn't use such a poor definition of death as its present standard of brain stem death. To label a patient as dead, their doctors need to perform just six simple manual bedside tests. These are, 1) shine a light in their eyes, 2) squirt cold water into their ears, 3) poke them gently in the eye, 4) poke more firmly toward the edge of the eye,  5) try to get them to gag or cough, 6) take them off respirator support for five or ten minutes and see if they spontaneously start breathing. This final test is an incredibly dangerous thing to do and risks both further brain damage and even immediate death.<p>The truth about brain stem death is that it is a diagnosis not of death, but of a dire condition with little chance (and if the diagnosis is accurate, possibly no chance at all) of the patient ever becoming responsive. If you accept this fact, you must conclude that the patient's true transition from life to death occurs on the operating room table as their organs are removed. Of course once a person is labelled ""dead"", providing them with the care of a qualified anaesthetist for the duration of the organ harvesting is just a ridiculously wasteful expense for a health service under pressure.<p>Before you join in with the applause for these proposed changes, have a think about how you would feel if a loved one of yours were deprived of oxygen for ten minutes in a procedure that might not even be mentioned to you. Think also of your loved one with a brain stem so injured that their eyes do not blink but with physiological and even motor responses to pain, and who-knows-what awareness and higher functions remaining, being opened up with electric saws at maximum speed.<p>Organ donation is important and at the present remains a necessity, but the plans to widen it's reach are an opportunity to demand of the doctors in this field that they are honest about what they are doing and that they improve their practices. In order to label someone as dead, brain-stem death and its ridiculously low-tech diagnostic standard should be abandoned. We should join the rest of the developed world in using a standard of whole-brain death, and it should require elaborate and prolonged testing involving advanced technologies such as brain imaging to assess the levels of brain activity under various sensory stimuli over time before the grave step of labelling an apparently live person as dead is taken. For the patients who cannot be proven to be in an irreversible state of whole-brain death, but who are expected to worsen and die even with all possible interventions, let the doctors who would take their organs present a case based on the reality of what they would be doing.\nLet them present the case for sacrificing live patients with no hope of recovery for the sake of other patients whose lives can be saved by an organ donation.\nThat is a legally difficult but morally defensible position. Once harvesting of organs is admitted to involve the living rather than the dead, at the very least it would mandate providing the donors with the same standard of anaesthesia, care, and dignity as the organ recipients. Whatever you think of the above, at least agree with me that we should give all donors the benefit of the doubt and require through legislation that they are anaesthetised and cared for just as though they were still alive.",1329249401
3591504,comment,3589949,3589949,1,0,ctdonath,,,"If you want ""experiences"", they're there for the taking at any cost from free to $OMGk.<p>The problem isn't so much providing them (although other posters address the issue of cost), it's whether the customer does, in fact, want to do his part. Go to a movie theater, look around, and ask what percentage of attendees would, in fact, want to spend the next 2 hours going thru an approximation of what they're going to sit there, mouth agape, staring at. Most wouldn't, even if they could - which most couldn't.<p>The opportunities for experiences are there. Skydiving. Romance. Wilderness adventure. World travel. Competition. Artistic expression. Whatever. Spend as much or as little as you like, in both time and money. I've seen all kinds of ""experiences"" appear and flourish in a few decades. Lots of people participate in them, as the height of our culture allows and facilitates unprecedented indulgence in luxury ""experiences"". Oh, they may not be as objectively exciting, but subjectively they can be fantastic (first time I did paintball - about the same price & duration & space as a high-end movie - it sure wasn't a James Bond film, but instead of ""that was neat, now what"" I drove around the city loop twice screaming in residual endorphin rush).<p>The key is audience participation. Anyone can jet off to exotic locations for wild times for just a few days' salary, and for even just the price & time of a movie go leap out of an airplane or take a romantic walk. Most, however, would rather push a button and say ""here we are now, entertain us.""",1329249385

Water: Drinking water is, of course, necessary, and quite a few people don't actually hydrate enough during the course of a day. +1 on this from me.<p>2. Fruits/vegetables: Now, fruits and vegetables are an essential part of <i>any</i> well-balanced diet, but if you're using them to satisfy an intermittent craving, I'm guessing you're probably going to reach for fruits. The problem with this is that if you're reaching for that apple a few times a day, you're still ingesting ~25g of carbohydrates (~9% daily recommended intake), and ~100 kcal. Eat four apples (or similar fruits), and you've suddenly consumed 1/5th of your caloric requirements and almost 40% of your carbs. In terms of macronutrients, an apple has about the same nutritional value as an 8oz bottle of coke.<p>Now don't get me wrong. Reaching for an apple instead of a muffin or a cupcake is unarguably <i>better</i>.<p>If you're reaching for vegetables instead of fruits, then most of what I stated above doesn't really apply. However, when those food cravings come around it's usually in response to a drop in blood glucose levels, which makes you reach for carb-laden foods first.<p>3. Nuts. Sigh. I don't know why people think nuts are actually something that's supposed to exist in a well-balanced diet. Perhaps it's the recent popularity of paleo. Anyways. Yes, nuts do contain a high percentage of poly- and monounsaturated fats, and fat is good for you. No one is going to argue that. But for the same caloric cost (~150 kcal for a serving of almonds, and that's a pretty tiny serving), you can eat a whole lot of more interesting and nutritious foods.

Otherwise, how are you going to make ends meet while you aren't working your day job?<p>What's also nice about finding the important items needed to get the business running is that, when you finally decide to quit your day job, you now know the important things in the business that you must prioritize.  It's like saying ""If I only had an extra 10 hours a week to work on the business, it would be 50% more profitable"".

For instance, when I first try to configure a new monitor, it consistently freezes up for about 30 seconds, reverts to the old display, and then magically works when I try it again.  And heaven forbid I want to align my monitors along the bottom edge (or ""absolutely positioned"").

Frustration for me comes from not knowing what happens under the hood and why the particular commands are the way they are. I see what they do, but I dont understand where they come from, nor their potential, nor their proper usage.<p>So I started to watch Harvard cs50 course online as well as getting my hands on anything that can help me better understand the underlaying architecture of hardware and software.<p>Allthough not sexy, imho, this decision is the best a beginner can make. Yes it will take you longer to make something concrete. Yes, you will find yourself touching languages you will seldom (if ever) use afterwards.

I see posts like this almost every day, and the point of every single one of them is ""I am already familiar with javascript, and I'm not familiar with coffeescript, so I HATE IT.""<p>It's very clear that you have not used coffeescript much, you just checked it out, glossed over a few features, tried to write something, were doing poorly because you didn't know it well, and said ""well fuck it, I'm going to write an angry rant about this"".<p>Let's break your post down to sections. Syntax first. Most people like the syntax. It's much easier to read for me and other developers, personally. If you don't like it, nobody's forcing you to use it.<p>Your analysis of 'wart removal' is misinformed too. Coffeescript is essentially a collection of helper functions for things we commonly need to do (as are many programming languages - for example, ruby, which a nicer syntax and a collection of helpers built on c). You missed all of them except for one. If the whole language was one helper function, you'd be right. But it's not. Read up before you rant.<p>I don't know what convinced you that javascript is different from every single other programming language enough such that classes are not useful, or why you again propose that classes are the only thing coffeescript contains. They are one helper function in a collection, and they are very helpful. I have used them a number of times in production code for large companies and it's saved me loads of time and made the code a lot cleaner.<p>If everyone had your philosophy, we would all be writing in assembly language and/or c. Hell, why do we need a whole different language to make the syntax nicer and contain helpers for common tasks? We could always just write a function for it, right?<p>It's a weird perspective coming from a language you understand to an abstraction that you don't, and that's why there are so many posts that say this exact same thing. But you have to keep at it until you understand it better, then the speed boosts and convenience will be worth every second.",1329247700

Since there is less code structured in simpler ways, there can be less tests (there are less code paths). Since the tests themselves are written more concisely, the tests themselves are smaller. The syntax errors will be caught in the tests because most dynamic languages actually compile the code. They just do it as needed.<p>Again, the 10x number is not out of thin air - we keep a lot of Java applications here and, more than once, we rewrote them in dynamic languages. We saw better than 10x ratios, although with the more recent, nicer Java code is more like 5x.<p>> Picking one example to refute the epidemic that occurs in the ecosystem is probably not a strong argument<p>I am not very familiar with the Rails ecosystem, but if most of the libraries someone picks tend to be abandoned, maybe the problem isn't in the libraries, but in the selection process.",1329247655
3591378,comment,3589949,3589949,1,0,neilk,,,"Burning Man is, in theory, devoted to interactive art. But, speaking from experience, those sorts of artworks are incredibly hard to create. In the Bay Area we have an interdisciplinary art community that can pump them out on a regular basis, but the costs to people's personal lives are immense. (Not to mention that people who like to create this sort of stuff rarely want to run it on a regular basis. They want to be Imagineers in their spare time, not full-time carnies.)<p>And what do we get when people show up? People seem to enjoy <i>looking</i> at the bizarre interactive stuff -- it gives them permission to be freer -- but most people, it seems, want formulaic experiences. They like dancing at sound camps, intoxication, and riding around on art cars in costumes. Which is just a typical Friday night clubbing, only more so.<p>But rather than criticize them for being unadventurous, let's look at what makes these experiences work. Music was invented a few hundred thousand years ago and there aren't many more direct routes to people's pleasure centers. It's also evergreen; a sound camp can swap DJs every few hours and have a different experience in the same environment.<p>Complicated art or interactive installations do their thing, but if you have a five ton sculpture that whirls boulders around, well, that's what it does. Rarely can they be as protean as a music hall or a movie house, or your personal computer.<p>The best you can do is some sort of hardware/software combination, like the Cubatron series, which has had various incarnations as a sort of 3d screen saver build out of LEDs. Syzygryd is an interactive, collaborative music sequencer in the shape of a giant sculpture that lights up and shoots fire.<p>Perhaps the best urban interactive experiences will be like that -- there might be some expensive hardware built component, but they need to plug into some inexhaustible source of new ideas too.",1329247654

They are only for 1 year and renewed at the team's discretion.  A team can cut you if you get permanently injured.  They typically don't because that would look bad to future recruits but if you can't continue with school they aren't going to keep you on scholarship.  They can move you to a medical scholarship but that happens less often than you'd think.<p>Second, I don't think you realize the amount of time it takes to play a college sport.  There's a reason a lot of athletes take something like General Studies, and it's not because they are all 'dumb jocks'.  The college and university will be accommodating but the fact is that there's a lot of practice time (4+ hours a day) and travel.  The football season is longer than most, even longer if the team is good (bowl games).  Any hard science that has a lab or field work is probably out.<p>I just don't think you are realistically looking at what your brother is getting himself into and your expectations seem way off.  He'd have to be one of those rare individuals to get a high-end degree and play a scholarship sport.  Choosing to be a scholarship athlete is choosing to work on a sport instead of working on a degree of 'substance'.",1329246264

3591268,comment,3589803,3591222,1,0,freehunter,,,"><i>you're done developing phones forever</i><p>There are dozens of different form-factors. Take a look at the diversity of the Android or even the WP7 market. Landscape sliders, portrait sliders, 4.3"", 3.7"", 5"", 3"", some with dual core, some with quad core, some with AMOLED screens, some with SAMOLED screens, some LCD screens. Some with removable SD cards, various amounts of storage, various price points of the market.<p>><i>Even the iPhone 4 and iPhone 1 look approximately the same</i><p>That's because Apple designed them all the same. The way Apple designs their products does not have any relation to the amount of possible designs.<p>><i>Android devices are even simpler because they only need a power button.</i><p>Android phones are supposed to have four face buttons. This is not strictly required (allowing for variation), but the phones expect you to have four buttons. Windows has three. Apple has one.<p>><i>you're stuck with whatever you get from your carrier</i><p>Except there <i>is</i> a <i>huge</i> amount of variation in the custom ROM world, which many Android devices allow.<p>><i>Phones are all software these days</i><p>A common misconception that will at some point pave the way for true innovation in hardware like we've seen in the past when the smartphone market stagnated (then the iPhone was released and it was exciting again).",1329246236
3591267,comment,3590939,3590939,9,0,ahmadss,,,"As a n00b trying to learn how to program, I completely agree with your points about Ruby on Rails. After getting in over my head going through a few rails tutorials, I took a step back and realized that while I could create really basic web apps and go through the keystrokes to write code and commit to Git, I didn't understand what the hell I was doing from a conceptual level. It was rote code copying from a tutorial or a book while leaving out the layer of actually understanding what and how the program works. It felt hollow.<p>I then took a step back and went to MIT's OCW courses that use Python to teach the basics of CS. None of the lectures introduced Django or other web frameworks, rather, they used Python as a means to teach core CS concepts. From there, I used the basics of what I learned to create simple scripts and conceptually understand what I was coding.<p>Then, I slowly ventured into Django tutorials. But even with the Django tutorials, I'm taking a step back because I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around databases, structuring data models, and basically, learning how to PLAN an app before I write code.<p>At the end of the day, I think it is really difficult to learn how to code on your own because it is so much more than learning syntax. This is where mentors and the community comes in. Mentors matter a whole lot more than great tutorials and working on a real project with other, more seasoned developers (basically, an apprenticeship) completes the circle of going from complete newbie to ""entry level programmer"".",1329246164

Depending on the school, CS can be part of the math department, science department, engineering department, or a liberal arts department.<p>My school grouped it in science/engineering and required a bunch of math, and quite a few science classes.  I've met people with the same degree from other schools who think it's crazy I took so much science and are surprised I had so few liberal arts classes.<p>It'd be nice if everybody were on the same page.",1329246131

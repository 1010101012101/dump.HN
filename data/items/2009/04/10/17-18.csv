Government's effects, aside from land grants, were dubious at best <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/pss/3115585"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/pss/3115585</a><p>Yes, there were bailouts. But that hardly makes modern railroads a function of government intervention. Aside from eminent domain, railroads have been very capable of operating and turning a profit on their own, at least when it comes to freight. Even then, it was <i>de</i>regulation of the industry that brought Conrail back to life (1980 Staggers Act) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_Central#Bankruptcy_and_Conrail_merger"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_Central#Bankruptcy_and_Con...</a> Even now, passenger rail is a money-sink, one that government continues to find worthwhile but the market does not.<p>The internet was ""invented"" by DARPA as a means to make research more effective. Unless you were at a federally-sponsored university, you didn't have internet access. But the <i>rollout</i> of the internet was very much a commercial thing. Delphi, America Online, UUNet, etc were all <i>commercial</i> players and they were the ones who brought internet to the masses. University participation was great in the early 80s when a small percentage of the population used it, but the ""real"" internet as we know it today runs on Cisco routers over Verizon cable to a local ISP owned by Sixpack Bob. It has grown and done just fine _without_ government help.<p>Lastly, toll roads are making a come-back, if you haven't noticed.

You can take some event, like the building of the trans-continental railroad, and focus just on government involvement. Then you can look down another layer and see lots of private sector involvement. Push down yet another layer and you'll find legislators pandering to businesses. Push down yet another and you'll find some businesses trying to build something to make a buck. If you're not seeing the entire depth, it can appear to be anything from government saving the day to free market euphoria. In fact, it's a complex mix of interaction that makes things work. Part of that reason is because of the driving factors: politicians are always looking to make things more complicated and businesses are always looking to create something to make more money.",1239386279

If anything maybe the government can find new ways of creating even more incentives for individuals to donate to charities and other causes.

The rich man benefits to the tune of many millions because society protects his property (both intellectual and physical), and provides him with a stable environment to do business in.

Food, household items, and rent in low-COL areas. Mostly, these are commodity goods. What do most rich people spend their money on? Trophy properties, expensive wines, and brand-name art-- in other words, items whose value is indexed to the status they confer. If you give the poor more money, their standard of living will improve. If you give the rich more money, the things they buy just become more expensive, and their standard of living doesn't change that much. The same argument holds when taxes are increased.<p>2. The rich get more, even on a percentage basis, from the government. If the government builds a road to a factory, each worker is a stakeholder in the project, using the road to get to work every day. However, the factory owner is a much bigger stakeholder; not only does the road enable him to get to work every day, but it also enables his workforce to do so. He's getting a lot more out of that road.<p>3. Money is the world's first AI algorithm-- an algorithm to allocate resources and manage society. Like many crude algorithms put to complex problems, it does a terrible job of this if left to its own devices, making improvements for a few iterations but later diverging to a degenerate state, and needs constant correction through means such as progressive taxation.",1239384513

So if we redistribute it to the poor, the whole of society will get better utility of that dollar.<p>Erm. Whoa there. This seems to me to be fundamentally flawed in no less than two respects...<p>1) $1 may be less valuable to a rich man than a poor man but that -does-not- imply that it is of less value to society for it to be in the rich mans hands than in the poor mans hands. In fact, it's quite easy to argue (and is often done) that it's substantially more valuable, to society as a whole, in the rich mans hands than in the poor man's hands.<p>2) More broadly, and the first point follows from this point, this is a false dichotomy. Society doesn't have a fixed number of wealth and it is not a zero sum game. You cannot trade dollars 1:1 and ignore the economic impact.<p>>  A question very relevant to us is ""Will it?"".<p>I find it interesting that you take the first proposition at face value as ""self-evidently"" true but feel the need to question this second proposition.

Sure the rich eat at Ruth Chris and the poor eat a McDonalds, but if you break it down to the normal level it is tough to spend more than $500 a month at the grocery store per person. It is also tough to spend less than $150 per person per month.<p>When I'm making $75 an hour as a programmer today I remember when I was making $8 an hour at McDonalds 6 years ago. When 90% of your income is going towards food, rent, shelter and then the government comes in and takes 30% it would effectively leave you with zero. No money to save, no money to pay for education etc.<p>But for me at $75 an hour, necessities are a small part. Now I'm saving and investing and have no debt and all this great stuff. So your saying it is a huge burden on me to pay 40% tax now so that people trying to get ahead like I was 5 years ago don't have to? Absolutely not. I still have plenty of money for everything I want.<p>It is more unethical to subsidize your personal discretionary spending at the expensive of somebody's necessities because you are simply greedy. That's the reason why the tax code has always been and will always be progressive - even in schemes like the flat tax system there is a credit for the bare necessities.",1239383544

If anything, we've seen riches being created throughout history with very <i>little</i> governmental help. In fact, it seems just the opposite -- we need government to help monopolies from running the markets.<p>So maybe the question is ""Now that you're rich, how much money should we take from you to protect us from rich people in general?""<p>But then again, taking money away from rich people doesn't actively solve the monopoly problem.

We pay taxes so that government can be funded, and in exchange government provides certain public services. Services like firefighters, police, hospitals, etc. If you think about it, these are services that everybody should receive equally, thus they should be services that everyone pays for equally. Currently we have a system where the rich pay a disproportionate amount of the costs for these services, and intentional or otherwise, what has happened is that the rich gain a disproportionately better use of these services, like the police are more likely to protect the rich than the poor, etc.<p>Bigger houses are more expensive to protect from fires than smaller houses, so real estate taxes should be proportional to the value of the property. Sales tax applies to everyone equally but those who consume more pay for more, which makes sense since those who consume more are making more use out of consumer protection agencies, like the FDA. Bigger companies are more expensive to regulate, so proportional corporate taxes make sense too.<p>But a human life is a human life. When one person pays more taxes than another person, the implication is that person deserves a larger share of the same essential services we are paying for than those who paid less.

Take away the alternative at $0.00, and their prices might well have very nice intersections of supply and demand, but with Kim Dotcom offering it at $0 or $5/mo for millions of products, the market is completely distorted.<p>I know that a lot of intellectually dishonest fellows such as yourself like to pretend that there are no lost sales, but no thinking person believes that trope.  It's obvious that if the same product is available for $20 and $0, that many of the people who understand how to get it for $0 will do so, even if they otherwise would've paid $20.",1330239381

3635024,comment,3633993,3634829,7,0,bermanoid,,,"While that's certainly a conceivable explanation (the ""gay uncle"" theory, that the gay members of a family help raise their family's offspring), I've always found it really tough to swallow the numbers there. More or less, it would require that each gay uncle increases the fitness of the family [see note 1 below, ""family"" is very important here, as opposed to ""group""!] by enough to make sure that on average, more than 1 additional child is produced per gay uncle. Put another way, with a 10% rate of homosexuality in the population at large, that would mean that at least 10% of our total reproductive success should be due to the helping hand that gays provide for family members' children. That's a lot, probably more than I'd realistically believe.<p>More likely, the gene that predisposes us to homosexuality (it doesn't cause it, as MZ vs DZ twin studies have shown that homosexuality has well below 50% genetic cause, with a much higher component based on individual environment, both pre and post-natal) is either beneficial in some other way (for instance, a recent study showed that female relatives of homosexuals tend to have more children, which could mean that the heritable bits behind homosexuality actually increase female reproductive rates enough to overwhelm the negatives on the male end), or live close on the chromosome to another gene that's more important, so the gene tends to stick around because of linkage even if it's harmful in some cases.<p>[1] The ""gay uncle"" theory relies on the fact that it's family members, i.e. people that are causally likely to share the gene in question, that are helped by the behavior. Google ""kin selection"" and ""group selection"" to understand the difference - briefly, kin selection is a totally legitimate effect because a gene helps itself through its prevalence in a family (and specifically, due to the fact that the gene will appear in the offspring that the gene helps make possible, even if it comes from other individuals), but group selection is completely bogus, because Prisoner's Dilemma-style defection is always the right strategy for a gene there.",1330238816

And those are much more helpful than single-character names would be.<p>Plus, the math tradition of one-character variable names means that they've had to adopt several different alphabets just to get enough identifier uniqueness (greek, hebrew, etc., plus specialized symbols like the real, natural, and integer number set symbols).  Which makes all that stuff a pain to type.  And even then, there are still identifier collisions where different sub-disciplines have different conventions for the meaning of a particular character.<p>It's also annoying because single-character names are impossible to google for.",1330236853

You can encrypt certain fields generating an encryption key based on non-encrypted data in the row (ex. your key may be sha256(primary key value + create time + application secret), and rather than protecting one master key you must protect the key-generation algorithm). Or you can have one master key that you use to encrypt data - this key should never be written to disk (the key should be decrypted into memory from your key custodians' passwords).  Or a combination of both. You should also have a way to version keys so that you can perform key rotation. Certain DB engines allow the entire database file to be encrypted (SQLite offers this with some paid extension, I believe). Or have the user encrypt the data before sending it (as some backup services do).<p>Consult an expert. I could give more details about effective encryption strategies, but I don't want a newbie finding my post, reading half of it, and implementing something dangerously bad. At least no encryption is at a known level of safety; data that's been encrypted incorrectly gives a huge false sense of security.",1330236274

8150785,comment,8148666,8150660,3,0,rbehrends,,,"> Do you claim it&#x27;s misleading that the GCs need at least twice as much RAM to be performant?<p>This is not what you wrote. You said that &quot;most GCs start being really slow even with 3 times more memory than needed with the manual management&quot;, while the generational mark-sweep collector has essentially zero overhead with 3x RAM in that benchmark. The &quot;most GCs&quot; you&#x27;re referring to are algorithms that are decades behind the state of the art.<p>Also, &quot;really slow&quot; is a fuzzy term and I am not sure how you come to that conclusion from the image.<p>Remember, they&#x27;re compared to an oracular allocator that has perfect knowledge about lifetime/reachability without actually having to calculate it. That ideal situation rarely obtains in the real world. The paper uses this case to have a baseline for quantitative comparison (similar to how in some situations speeds are expressed as a fraction of c), not because it represents an actual and realistic implementation.",1407455941

He made enough to rent a basement apartment and feed and clothe himself, and got to see lots of the world going on tour. That&#x27;s fantastic and I love that he got to follow his desire.

8150759,comment,8148854,8148854,2,0,pnathan,,,"One thing that I have observed and learned is money management &quot;strategies&quot; or &quot;styles&quot; vary between socioeconomic brackets.<p>E.g., tradespeople don&#x27;t always futz with stocks; they don&#x27;t have the appetite for risk and volatility that stocks introduce. Long-term investing tends to be not done (maybe 401(k) or an IRA is used). Some of that is due to a lack of discretionary income, some of that is just culture.<p>When you cross a certain barrier upwards, financial understanding of stocks and so forth increases, and money is leveraged to produce, e.g., use of index funds and their return on investment.<p>Moving downward in the socioeconomic classes and passing another another barrier, money saving becomes less common, and impulse purchases appear to become more common.<p>---<p>Some of this is definitely familial: I never learned about investments growing up and had to self-teach. That has limited my total financial situation to date. I did, however, learn about self-control, discipline, and self-teaching, which has helped me move forward financially.<p>Another aspect is behavior expectations of the successful - How to comport and present yourself in a way that signals that you are a professional, capable and trustworthy individual?  I feel comfortable saying that most anyone from a poor/blue-collar background and who has now made it into the white-collar ranks can join with me in saying that <i>that</i> is a big deal.

Trouble is the memory area is <i>dramatically</i> larger than the computation area.<p>Imagine if you were a reference librarian, asked for facts like some kind of ancient Google.

Engineers have been hard at work at this for decades.<p>- Use less memory. This is slower.<p>- Use a memory hierarchy. This is what we do today, and is analogous to you sitting in a bedroom-sized library with the Library of Congress just down the street, and a young courier who fetches you books from it.<p>The other challenge is speed.

People who claim that OSX is better are simply biased or drinking the typical apple fan boy kool aid. If anything, I would compare the development tools and in that sense Visual Studio is the best IDE out there!<p>My schooling was in Solaris, Windows and Unix. About 15-20 years ago open-source software was mostly available on <i>nix variants and not as much on Windows. Most people didn&#x27;t want to pay for software, so they chose </i>nix... OSX happens to be a variant of FreeBSD (if I remember correctly), so it can run everything that runs in *nix. IMO, it was mainly used by graphics designers because of better hardware and some standard software that came with OS X. I think if you looked at Photoshop, you could do the same things regardless of the OS.<p>At home, I use Windows on a Macbook because I like the form factor of the Macbook and because Windows makes me more productive. I&#x27;ve done startups / developed under various platforms and there&#x27;s not a single system where you&#x27;re restricted....other than typical iOS stuff on the Mac and Windows Phone stuff on Windows. With new frameworks, you can develop for any mobile platform on any OS. I think OS X fans have probably based their opinion off of a handful of issues they&#x27;ve faced in Windows. Nobody seems to compare and contrast specific issues where Mac is a winner.<p>People that complain about Windows have probably not tried to install and configure remotely complex products on Linux like mail servers for instance. Their complaints are not usually first hand experiences. IIS on the other hand was a PITA to configure in Windows, but it really isn&#x27;t as bad as people made it look.<p>I&#x27;ve coded in many languages/frameworks on Windows just fine:\n- NodeJS / Server side JS\n- Python\n- C++\n- C\n- Java\n- Ruby / RoR\n- R\n- Matlab\n- Web based HTML5 / JS\n- C#\n- VB<p>The only time I was forced to use OS X was for developing iOS apps around in 2007.<p>As far as your CS degree goes, I would start out with learning typical core computing concepts:\n- Algorithms\n- Data structures\n- Processor Architecture\n- Compilers\n- Memory Management\n- Etc.<p>In addition, I would keep a few different kinds of OS&#x27;s handy and set up the same stuff across all of them to see how it&#x27;s done and what the issues are. Along the way, keep blogging about your experience so you can always refer to it.

I.e. how to make use of limited computing power efficiently can be more important than how much of it there is.<p>For comparison, here is a static site served by a machine with a <i>4MHz</i> custom CPU: <a href=""http://www.magic-1.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.magic-1.org/</a> (more details at <a href=""http://www.homebrewcpu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homebrewcpu.com/</a> )",1407455051

We don&#x27;t pipeline because Moore&#x27;s law has ended. We pipeline because a two-stage pipeline is 200% as fast as an otherwise identical unpipleined chip.

I think that would be good for society, because the success-minded people who naturally come to control decision-making and run things around don&#x27;t seem to care much (or don&#x27;t grok) that there&#x27;s this other side of mankind who don&#x27;t quite fit in what they build. At least culturally these people still get a say, they do shape culture after all, but I&#x27;m afraid that&#x27;s gonna be less and less so, at least when it comes to the masses. The internet helps give them voice, sure, but when those who are like this and have a cosmopolitan view can&#x27;t afford a like-minded city, we lose scenes and movements and all these beautiful artistic expressions of a time and place and group of people.<p>In the field of software development, of course, there are many, who usually devote their lives to open source or learning materials and don&#x27;t really mind not having money (except when it starts pressing hard.) Richard Stallman could well be considered a great example who went on to make amazing contributions for our collective good, and his patron was the US Military. Alas, research budgets are being cut and cut, especially long-term research without sure profitability, and universities are on their way to bankrupcy, and times like that don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re coming back again.",1407453962

His essential points:<p>1. Building special-purpose hardware for neural nets is a good idea and potentially very useful.<p>2. The architecture implement by this IBM chip, spike-and-fire, is <i>not</i> the architecture used by the state-of-the-art convolutional networks, engineered by Alex Krizhevsky and others, that have recently been smashing computer vision benchmarks. Those networks allow for neuron outputs to assume continuous values, not just binary on-or-off.<p>3. It would be possible, though more expensive, to implement a state-of-the-art convnet in hardware similar to what IBM has done here.<p>Of course, just because no one has shown state-of-the-art results with spike-and-fire neurons doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s impossible! Real biological neurons are spike-and-fire, though this doesn&#x27;t mean the behavior of a computational spike-and-fire &#x27;neuron&#x27; is a reasonable approximation to that of a biological neuron. And even if spike-and-fire networks are definitely worse, maybe there are applications in which the power/budget/required accuracy tradeoffs favor a hardware spike-and-fire network over a continuous convnet. But it would be nice for IBM to provide benchmarks of their system on standard vision tasks, e.g., ImageNet, to clarify what those tradeoffs are.",1407453399

I do have some minor questions, though!<p>The simplest improvement that confused me at first is the ability to declare a new inline local to handle an &#x27;out&#x27; variable:<p>int x;\nfoo(out x)<p>becomes<p>foo(int x)<p>This by itself is a quality-of-life improvement but it enables the really nice extraction of values for pattern matching. I&#x27;m happy to see this as a general language feature instead of a hack specific for records. (Was this already introduced in a proposed future C# version, and I missed it?)<p>The record classes considerably simplify the creation of simple data structures, trees, etc. This alone would kill thousands and thousands of lines of pointless duplicate code in JSIL, so I&#x27;m really happy to see it. Are the properties of record class instances read-only? (It&#x27;s hard to tell from the draft spec. I&#x27;d be okay with mutable-by-default with opt-in readonly, but always-readonly would also be okay with me as a simpler design.)<p>The introduction of an overloaded &#x27;is&#x27; operator that accepts user-defined arguments on the right-hand-side. You define the operator on a given type and give it out-parameters (and presumably it can accept value parameters, as well, so you can do more sophisticated matching), and the compiler converts that into a call to the matching function that, if successful, yields values from the match. Really clever way to introduce this - the syntax is slightly confusing, but it avoids introducing new keywords and almost all of this feature follows nicely from existing C# features.<p>And switch statements are expanded to be able to pattern-match! Lovely! This is a natural improvement given that switch statements are already compile-time sugar for dictionary lookups when you&#x27;re switch()ing on non-integer values.<p>It seems like all of this is compile-time sugar that doesn&#x27;t require any runtime changes.

This seems to indicate that iperf and netperf are completely unreliable for testing this type of connection. Bear in mind though that I did have netperf running on the previous ubuntu install, but that installation was so messy I don’t know what drivers and user-space software was running.

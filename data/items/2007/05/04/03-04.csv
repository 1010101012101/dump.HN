Branding implies consistency, and no startup, no matter how pretty or expensive their logo is, is going to know exactly what they stand for, and they shouldn't know going into it all.<p>If branding was important to startups, no startups would exist, as they usually have no brand name.",1178250886

They may liquidate, since sunk costs are sunk.<p>According to Paul's essays, the software of Viaweb was powerful because it was written in a high-level (but bottom-up) way.  It seems like besides this being an edge over your competitors, it would also make your investors leery of getting rid of you.  Who else would want to buy it if the Viaweb team wasn't there to walk them through it?  And wouldn't that consideration also be true for lenders?  I recall reading something about Trump's period of declining fortunes years ago - to whom, exactly, were the banks going to sell his gaudy yacht and other outrageously expensive and virtually unsellable properties?  They were better off pretending he could still be successful for a while, and they got lucky.\n",1178249515

The greater the % of Harvard MBAs working on Wall St the worse market performance.  The analysis went further and suggested that any time more than 30% of the graduating Harvard Business School class went to work on Wall St, it was time to Sell Sell Sell!<p>I was working at Microsoft at the time, and the place seemed overrun with a bunch of recently hired Ivy League MBAs (particularly Harvard grads).<p>The slate piece:<a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2109982/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2109982/</a>",1178249092

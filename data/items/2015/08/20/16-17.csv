X86, ARM, etc. So as long as code can talk to low level hardware and get executed, it doesn&#x27;t really matter what you language you&#x27;re using.<p>I can understand the need to have others pick up from where you left off, but that&#x27;s introducing politics into programming, and more oft than not, it confuses what you&#x27;re trying to achieve (which is converting some form of input to output I hope)<p>As a first port of call, it would be preferable to know one low level language like C, and a scripting / CRUD language like PHP/JS, as a lot of application development now is web based. Bonus points for learning ASM as that&#x27;s as low level as we can get. (Unless you work in an Intel chip facility and are not allowed tell people what you&#x27;re working on).",1440089990

If we cut them, he says we&#x27;d &quot;only&quot; have to increase taxes 18%. Neither seems particularly affordable to me — remember, this is on top of our existing rates.<p>If we cut existing beenfits, it still seems to me many disabled/unemployed people would be worse off with BI, or about the same, as the current system. So we&#x27;re left with massively higher taxes, and people who can&#x27;t work will be left poorer.<p>The second article mentions all the secondary social benefits, and all the costs we&#x27;ll avoid associated with people living in poverty. I buy that, but a 18%-35% tax rate itself is also going to have a massive deadweight losses as well which he&#x27;s not accounting for. Current marginal rates are 30-40%, so we&#x27;ll now have 48%-75% marginal rates (or assuming a 35% increase, 65% to 75%). Think that won&#x27;t make society poorer and decrease the incentive to work?<p>I want a stronger social safety net. But BI seems to me like a extremely costly way to do it. There are many things we can do that would have higher bang for the buck.",1440089968
10093116,comment,10092662,10092910,0,0,guscost,,,"Prior to the satellite record historical temperature data is much less reliable, since each source is in a local area and may have different heat island effects, calibration, or quality of instruments. Additionally not as many stations were operating in 1880, which means more uncertainty about the data we do have.<p>Folks have tried to get around this by finding <i>proxies</i> for temperature (measurements that are theorized to track temperature, like the width of tree rings for example), and then calibrating that data by comparing it with the intervals for which we have reliable data (since 1970 for satellite data, or earlier for whatever thermometer data might be suitable). The long-term trends are identified and argued based on these proxies.<p>So to answer your question, they can calibrate a proxy using the satellite record, see what it suggests about 1880, and combine that with the available temperature data, but that&#x27;s about it.",1440089961

I&#x27;m far too lazy to calculate random odds right now, but setting a new high at a 17 year interval doesn&#x27;t seem remarkable.

Data, numbers, the good stuff!<p>> This also eliminates the need for pesticides since you&#x27;re closing off the plants from insects.<p>You don&#x27;t need to grow indoors to grow pesticide-free.  Nor do you need to grow indoors to protect plants from pests.<p>> Organically grown plants are GMO free and therefore need a lot more pesticides to keep it looking good. So if you want to pay the cheaper price for a mouth of chemical then that&#x27;s on you.<p>Holy conflation, Batman!  First of all, &quot;organic&quot; is a family of growing methods; one could grow GM stock using organic methods if one wished, though in most places it will be difficult to get certification.  Second, by definition &quot;organic&quot; methods prohibit or greatly restrict the use of pesticides.  So you&#x27;re contradicting yourself here; someone growing non-GM food organically is by definition not using them.<p>> I agree that the electricity usage is an issue but this is something that is being solved. Year by year we see lights getting more efficient and solar panels getting more efficient as well.<p>As I explained, this doesn&#x27;t matter.  A 100%-efficient PV module connected to a 100%-efficient LED bulb with a 100%-efficient transmission and distribution system is <i>at best</i> going to provide the same growing area as the area of those PV modules.  The physics of the situation simply do not allow anything more than that, and in this universe, where we obey the laws of thermodynamics, they don&#x27;t even allow that.  Surface farming will <i>always</i> be more efficient than covering the surface with PV modules and farming somewhere else.  If you cannot accept this, then your entire argument reduces to &quot;indoor farming is a perpetual motion machine&quot; and you should expect it to be taken as such.<p>> When it comes to running out of farmable land and fresh water becoming more scarce and a growing population though,<p>If you don&#x27;t have fresh water, you cannot farm anywhere, period.  A tap in an urban building is not inhabited by magical water fairies; that water comes from the same places that traditional farms get theirs.  If you believe you have a more water-efficient way to farm, why not combine that with the most energy-efficient farming method as well and employ it on the surface?

Even if you don&#x27;t particularly want a management position, focus on that aspect of your career.  It&#x27;s going to be hard to convince a prospective company that you&#x27;re worth the money as a developer if all you have to offer is 12 years of ASP.<p>I ran the software dept for a small consulting company and yes you&#x27;d probably never get a call back from me if you were applying purely as a developer.  While we have hired late 30-somethings developers, it&#x27;s usually because they offer some fairly unique tech skillset (i.e., a few years of production-quality FPGA experience, not a couple months dorking around with &quot;whatever hot new technology&quot; on github--that&#x27;s something I look for in a fresh-grad).  So I think for a purely tech role, beyond getting another job at a similar company doing similar tech, you&#x27;re a long shot at best.<p>But beyond that, the one thing that would case me to look at your resume is if you were wanting a leadership position and had the corresponding soft skills and experience.  It sounds like you do, so highlight that, and work on it.  The advantage there is that management skills: talking to stakeholders, setting expectations and timeframes, finalizing deliverables...are all applicable no matter what the underlying technology.  So there&#x27;s no reason you&#x27;d have to limit yourself to ASP management roles.<p>My previous company had lots of young developers doing engineering with lots of new technologies, but they&#x27;d have never delivered a thing had they not been guided by some experienced devs who actually spent most of their time in Excel (or trello or Jira or whatever we happened to be using to manage the particular project).",1440088777

The students found the O’Reilly books great (so many professional expertise at their fingertips)! But they found the S4S web page boring as it was just an alphabetical listing of book titles. So they made a portal to the site, with graphics, thumbnails of book covers, sorting, deep linking. It&#x27;s also the big fundraiser of the year for the class.<p>But the fun part of their portal &quot;Steampunk Franklin&quot; is their visual theme … “Benjamin Franklin as Steampunk” which is cool for a lot of their fellow teens! They have several quotes from Franklin which are cool for teens as well. They partnered with their fellow CTE Digital Graphics Design class to do the graphics for them, just like your professional tech companies do. They also made a documentary about how they built the portal (see the Safari Books Online blog post).<p>The class wants to pay it forward, in appreciation for getting so many professional books for free. So, they open sourced the portal software. They’re hoping you and other web design/programming experts can show them some best practices by submitting pull requests.<p>But, they can’t keep going on this project without funds. So, they’ve made some very cool “Steampunk Franklin” t-shirts for a donation, that have cool Ben Franklin quotes on them. \n<a href=""http://www.gofundme.com/steampunk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gofundme.com/steampunk</a><p>And now they want to build a website with to help solve the Calif. water shortage crisis … with Thorium LFTR reactors in submarines off the coast generating electricity, hydrogen, pure water, hot water, and oxygen to revive the coastal hypoxia dead zones, power generation submarines that they can also export to other countries.

What else would let them so ardently believe in an economic system that&#x27;s never been actually demonstrated to work.<p>You argue that, by mathematical definition, a steepening Pareto curve will increase motivation for everyone on it, and that: &quot;Now that your claims about incentives and your conflation of poverty and inequality are debunked[...]&quot;<p>Have you considered the possibility that in the actual world the curve doesn&#x27;t strictly conform to the mathematical one?  That it flattens early, or that the whole thing is translated downward?  Or that it&#x27;s not a Pareto curve but one that is similar?  Or that (as has a lot of evidence behind it) that socially-based incentives are sensitive to relative inequality, not absolute?  I pointed to an abstraction for illustration, and you made claims based on that abstraction and called it proof of the real world.<p>This is economics: there&#x27;s no such thing as &quot;debunking&quot;, there&#x27;s no such thing as &quot;proof&quot;.  There&#x27;s evidence, and there&#x27;s models that maybe explain some aspects of it better than others, from a very narrow view.  Models can&#x27;t demonstrate anything, all they can do is suggest experiments to be carried out in the actual world, at which point what happens there trumps any claims that they may have made.<p>The only thing we really have is comparative studies, across nations and through time.  Everything else is just fooling ourselves with our own metaphors.<p>So when you discard the only thing that we&#x27;ve got as &quot;a few cross-country correlations between inequality and other bad things&quot;, what exactly are going going to replace that with, your theories?

Given a computer system with intelligence much greater than a human (not necessarily passing the Turing test or being intelligent by certain human metrics, but being very effective at problem solving and engineering) could result in most of the current problems that companies like Boston Dynamics, et al have been working on for years being solved and tested in simulations in mere minutes. Such a machine can&#x27;t just be invented, but through evolution (genetic algorithms, etc.) on the copious cloud computing environments, such a machine will eventually happen, unless something changes (e.g., laws to attempt to prevent it, disaster of some sort that sets us back financially and computer-wise a few decades, etc.).<p>This means, the thing we should really fear is machine intelligence, since the physical world aspect of its existence is really secondary. A machine that can design better solutions to physical world problems (like moving around, negotiating obstacles, etc.) than the hundreds of teams working on the same thing is what I fear.",1440087851

Like other (all that I know of, in fact) voting systems on popular social sites, Hacker News' is biased in favor of comments that repeat the established, arrive early, and are written by popular authors. All criteria which are subtly different from quality of contents.<p>My first comment was <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=739112"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=739112</a>\nBeing my first intervention on HN, I thought I would be able to post anonymously so I included my name at the bottom of the post. The first reply (which, I admit is polite, well written and from a relatively famous person in this community, although not completely on-topic with respect to the article originally linked) got upvoted above ten. My comment, which revealed a lesser-know but true fact strongly related to the original article, with reference to an experiment that you can reproduce at home, was upvoted twice or something like that.",1253966149

Then he changed story.<p>Edit: I might also add that Godalus' second code example modified an array inside an append to the array -- inside two tight loops... I've only seen things like that in obfuscations. (It could be extreme optimization -- but with a few earlier versions in comments or cvs/subversion/git/etc.) Tell me THAT code choice is not trolling...?<p>Edit: Removed the rest, which has been written by multiple people in this thread.",1253965936

845343,comment,843587,845021,0,0,eugenejen,,,"There are part of computer science and engineering dealing with well defined problems. then it is easier to judge solutions to problems by proofs and test cases. Whoever can't prove their code is right or writing test cases are really criminal in their professions.<p>But there are another part of computer science and engineering dealing with fuzzy requirements or unknown problems. I don't see any better way to explore that area except trials and errors and the scientists and engineers have to face possible charges of ""piss-poor"", unethical, criminal and evil for the consequences of their solutions.<p>I feel that you have a very clear dichotomy of moral system. Unfortunately I deal with fuzzy things daily and see the harms of dichotomy in creating new stuffs and burning through money without any fruit of labor. It is easy for you to improve existing technologies because you can define criteria for improvements. But it is so hard in underfunding web startups that you can't expect in advance what a new solutions will be to users unless you make it and test it with them.<p>If I need someone to preserve and maintain existing software systems, because specifications and use cases are well defined, people like you are well fit for the task. But if someone has a new idea to solve a new problem that no one solved before, I would rather to see an unsophisticated solution first to test against the problem and start from there, and I am ready to rewrite the system when the problem becomes clearer.",1253964390

I believe this is completely normal and reflects the ability to doubt yourself. The fact that I initially think a story or comment is valuable, does not mean it actually <i>is</i> valuable: I may be wrong. As there will usually be comments reflecting different sides of the issue, I need to know what the community thinks the value of these comments is, relative to each other.<p>20 Points for a comment 'supporting' my position and 20 for a comment arguing 'against' my position indicate that I shouldn't be too certain, but that my position is (probably) at least rational.<p>20 Points for a comment 'supporting' my position and 1 for a comment arguing 'against' my position is an additional sign that I am probably on the right track.<p>1 Point for a comment 'supporting' my position and 20 for a comment arguing 'against' my position is a clear sign that I may have missed something and should read that comment carefully.<p>I really dislike this change.",1253962845

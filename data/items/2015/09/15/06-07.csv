I didn&#x27;t mean to come across so critical. It&#x27;s just so close to being a great idea that can solve what I see as a huge problem-- why are people taking out loans for a bullshit University of Phoenix degree? Because they don&#x27;t know what their options are, and they don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s going to cost, and they have some feeling in the back of their head that college is always a worthwhile investment. That&#x27;s how we nationally end up with more student debt loan than credit card debt.<p>With a little more data and a bit more prodding, this could genuinely fix that. No longer will people be getting their primary source of information from 2:00AM University of Phoenix commercials.<p>When I said the execution was poor it was not to say that this is somehow botched, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s so damn close.

10219314,comment,10218249,10218554,0,0,Camillo,,,"> If everyone called a tail a leg, it would be a leg.<p>You are sorely confused. When mixing different languages, you need to keep track of which is which, otherwise you just end up making a pun. In this case, &quot;if everyone called a tail a leg&quot; hypothesizes an alternate English where the distal portion of a dog&#x27;s spine is called &quot;leg&quot; instead of &quot;tail&quot;. We&#x27;ll call this English Prime, and denote English prime words with a hash sign, to distinguish them from ordinary English words: #leg.<p>Obviously, the sentence itself is still written in English, not in English Prime. Otherwise it would be impossible to ascribe any meaning to it, since we have not defined the meaning of any English Prime words besides #leg - and we could not even define that one without using English.\nThe only words that are to be interpreted as English Prime are the ones that are explicitly quoted from the hypothetical scenario. Therefore, &quot;if everyone called a tail a leg&quot; can be written as &quot;if everyone called a tail a #leg&quot;.<p>Now we have the following:<p>- If everyone called a tail a #leg, it would be called a #leg. Clearly true.<p>- If everyone called a tail a #leg, it would be called a #tail. Clearly false.<p>- If everyone called a tail a #leg, it would be a tail.

I bought myself a laser cutter for my wedding (she got a ring, i got a 90watt), and it came with an iLok for the horrible software that the chinese company built. It just takes up a USB port i could otherwise use.<p>That being said, its a great tool for very big, old software companies that have to protect from pirating.<p>I think that you have an entirely different play at hand. Because you are building a platform, you dont care if people pirate. What you just want to be sure of is that people aren&#x27;t sharing logins. Soooo....just make the logins tie to personal info. Back in the day, when I used to send sensitive PDFs, I would just make the password on the PDF the recipients last 4 of their SSN. I could basically guarantee they wouldnt send the PDF around. The equivalent in your situation is to use Oauth with something like LinkedIn or Google. For the users to share your account, they would need to create an fake LinkedIn or Google account...and if you system is all about lead generation, that becomes crippling.<p>Overall, i dont care about iLok vs another form of protection.  For me, the most important thing you are thinking about is can you create an amazing amount of value for your customer. Can you get them hooked, and improve their (business) life. If you can, then you can put a dollar amount on that improvement. I used Bloomberg terminals many moons ago, and it was not the best software in the world, but the data was immensely valuable.

For example, when we launch Spark (now Particle), we thought it would be hardware hobbyists. After looking through the list of backers, we found out that it was actually professional engineers, looking for a good wifi solution for prototyping. Had we focused on shipping before talking with our audience, we would have put our energy into the wrong place.\nWith Prynt for example, we found a specific demographic (young female) was the best click thru we had...this changed our collateral and retail conversations.<p>Then there is the question of what qualifies as a &quot;successful campaign&quot;? If you sell your product at a loss (I can point to some examples) and sell over a million, i dont know if i consider that a success. Whereas, Particle has done multiple 600k plus campaigns. For a consumer product that might be OK, but for a developer kit, that represents a massive amount of LTV.<p>All in all, i would say that I dont invest entirely based on a kickstarter campaign (and most often commit before the campaign happens) but the more data the better, and the more action the team has done, the better to learn their behaviors.",1442299372

In looking at tools like this, it&#x27;s hard to know where the line is between simple functions that you then use to create abstract features, and more complicated interfaces that define features explicitly. It&#x27;s a nuanced thing. With Workflowy, the simple list and tag interface can do much of what Notion does (of course, minus the great design and multimedia support), but you really need a formal workflow and need to stick to it to make it function well. Whereas Notion kind of designs those patterns for you, but at the expense of some interface simplicity. I feel like Workflowy demands more of a unix philosophy to achieve Notions features. You&#x27;ll need to chain web apps together. For example, you can use hyper links in Workflowy to link to files in dropbox, or host images on some other site and audio/video on another, where Notion puts in all in one spot. Very cool.<p>I can definitely see this as a great tool in the classroom for creating interactive discussions. Copy a template for each class and you can have everyone collaborate and focus on the discussion, not taking notes (or better still, take notes in the collaborative page itself, things that aren&#x27;t originally there), and then after you have a record of everything which you can share across all students and with different classes.<p>[1] <a href=""https://workflowy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://workflowy.com/</a>",1442298767

In the interim its impact is limited (because it is a long-term project).<p>It makes no sense to compare the two ventures as some competition. The worlds needs both.

They track you wherever you go, not just online but offline too and people are starting to realise how intrusive this is. Most people are reasonable. A lot of articles have been publish about how terrible ads are but if you show them in a tasteful and a non-intrusive way (meaning that they don&#x27;t track the user), they can be very successful.<p>Podcasts have been getting more and more popular everyday and I listen to a lot of them. I almost never skip any podcast ads even though I&#x27;ve heard most of them before because they feel more authentic (mostly because it&#x27;s read by someone whose opinion I trust) and they&#x27;re not intrusive at all. It seems like a good trade of to listen to them while getting great entertaining/informative content for free <i>and</i> I might get a good deal on something I might be interested in (since they mostly offer promo codes). If I&#x27;m listening to a podcast on technology, I get to hear Hover&#x27;s ad spot, for example. That&#x27;s interesting to me because as someone who&#x27;s interested in listening to a podcast about technology, it&#x27;s possible that I already manage a couple of domains and I might not be happy with my registrar (then again, who is). They&#x27;re generically targeted ads. While on the websites, cookies follow me wherever I go, sometimes even when I delete them and my information is sold by companies I trust as a user because they&#x27;re greedy and some other party want my information just so they can put ads in front of my face. When I try to block these, I&#x27;m called unethical because I&#x27;m taking food off the table of the writers.<p>There&#x27;s a middle way here but I don&#x27;t think ad networks ever going to realise this the same way movie studios haven&#x27;t realised you can&#x27;t solve piracy problem by adding more and more DRM. Don&#x27;t be intrusive. Don&#x27;t fuck up the UX. Don&#x27;t bother me. I don&#x27;t mind removing my ad blocker and see ads if that means I&#x27;ll support the websites I visit. But ad networks are greedy and I fear this is only going to make them become more intrusive because of how easy (and now probably widely reached) ad blockers are going to become.

And how are you so sure they won&#x27;t go the other direction? Because that&#x27;s where I&#x27;d place my money in a heart beat.<p>Adblockers rely on blocking requests to known ad networks and affiliates. If the ads are instead served up locally, from the site the person is visiting itself, it can&#x27;t block the ads. Ad blockers are 100% ineffective in those instances. A company like google or any other major ad network just needs to create some sort of back-end, plugin or server side program that serves up ads from the domain you&#x27;re visiting. The ad blocker wouldn&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a picture of a cat or an ad for Netflix since it&#x27;s all coming from randomsite.com<p>Several smaller companies have already started doing this and it could very well signal the end of ad blockers if it becomes widespread and adopted by the big players (specifically adsense).<p>The one thing I <i>don&#x27;t</i> see is ad companies becoming more transparent & open. That&#x27;s silly to even think about since it&#x27;s less profitable alternative. The companies that don&#x27;t do this will cannibalize the ones that do since they&#x27;ll be shooting themselves in the foot. No, I see ad companies becoming more clever.<p>As far as content creators go, I don&#x27;t even know how this is a debate. Just how entitled are people nowadays? Is this why they call millennials the entitled generation? If someone creates content, and wants people to see an ad for Pepsi before you can consume that content, that is the creators prerogative, not yours. End of story.

1218343,comment,1218075,1218290,0,0,sailormoon,,,"<i>But that's not the near future.</i><p>Well, I think you're underestimating the pace of technological progress. Yes, I might not personally live to see the day, but I don't think it will be that far away. There are a lot of rapidly aging rich people. Research is increasing in pace, not decreasing, and efforts like SENS are only just getting started.<p>Those billions of data points are largely irrelevant on a timeline where technology only increases in potency. Historical death rates offer almost no guidance to a future where the causes of those billions of deaths are being isolated and eliminated faster than ever. You do know that according to Moore's law, computers will overtake the human brain in the 2020s, right? Where's the historical precedent for that?<p>You might have a point that immortality boosters are motivated somewhat by hope and self-interest, but you seem to be biased in the other direction, for no reason I can discern.<p>It is rational for any living being to seek to extend their life. Admitting it is possible and desirable is merely the first step. Why not considering taking it?

1218333,comment,1218199,1218199,0,0,EliAndrewC,,,"Anecdotally this fits with my experiences on death march projects.  I've often seen people learn a new programming language and/or set of libraries while on a tight deadline and getting yelled at for being behind schedule.  Their knowledge retention is <i>drastically</i> worse than when they're on a more relaxed project.  In my experience, someone who takes an unhurried week to do a small project in an unfamiliar environment will learn a lot more than someone forced to spend a month frantically trying to make a deadline in that same environment.<p>An interesting corollary is that someone who really cares about their job may end up being less effective in the long run than someone who does.  Specifically, someone who cares about making their insane deadlines and who gets stressed at the thought of looking bad will end up retaining less knowledge about the programming languages and libraries that they use.  They'll also be more inclined to copy/paste code without really understanding it just to make their deadline, etc.<p>Conversely, when someone who doesn't care much about their company's priorities is given a task, they can take a more relaxed attitude and learn much more.  They might say, ""Well I'm supposed to finish this C# program in 2 days, but if I take 1 extra day then I can learn how to use the .NET logging framework, figure out how to use delegates, and really understand how its threading model differs from pthreads.""  In the long run, this employee will probably be more effective than the ones who listen to their managers and try to finish everything now-now-NOW!  And according to the OP, they'll probably retain what they learn much better as well, which definitely fits with my experiences.",1269521474

This is something I didn't understand at 20 but know too well at 40. The human mind is made to forget things -- lots of things. In fact, the ability to forget things is probably what keeps us sane and able to focus. Otherwise one thing would trigger another and we would just spin off on tangents all the time.<p>Having read the article, and agreeing with the points and sentiments, I still think the Great Singularity Cometh. Just nowhere near 20 years. More like 500. And I think by that time we will have a <i>much</i> different idea of what is human and what is not. So it all works out.<p>I've been meaning to set up getting frozen when I die. Not for immortality -- I think the problems Jacques mentions will work out but take a while -- but simply for life extension. I think the definition of ""die"" is a lot more flexible than we currently imagine and I think there's a chance that sometime in my lifetime we'll work out cryogenics to the point where there's a shot at getting another 20-40 years at some point in the distant future after you die the first time. (Although coming back to life with everybody else you know gone for hundreds of years has to be a very sobering thing.)<p>But the main, critical point here is that yes, you will die. And, apologies for the existentialist plug, but how you deal with your impending death, in a real and immediate fashion, is what separates you from a lawn slug. The denial of one's death through whatever fashion is a great travesty on what it means to be human.<p>And I'm almost certain the Easter Bunny isn't coming for somebody here, but I'm not going to mention any names.

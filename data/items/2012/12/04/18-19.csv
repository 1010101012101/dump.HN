My best friend had all the castles and my cousin was obsessed beyond anyone I have ever met, even today.<p>Currently I am into the Mindstorms sets. I buy them all. Right now I have 2 of them and I want very badly some of the 3rd party accessories to make some unique fun robotic machines or robots. The possibilities seem endless. There are so many neat ones I can't decide what I should build to use them now. I find my self thinking of robots that could do something only to make an excuse to buy the part and build it.<p>This situation that the boy was in reminds me of Nintendo games.<p>1.

4872601,comment,4870768,4871528,3,0,anonymous,,,"""a large number of names"" is a metric that differs for different people. Some find it much easier to parse text when everything is named, some prefer to have things unnamed and just spelled out. Think of having a hash from name->function vs a hash essence->function. The first people can see a name, remember it, look it up and form a connection. The latter can see a logical block of code, parse it and then recognise it when they see it again.<p>Personally, I'm in the latter camp. There are people whose names I've been told more than 5 times, but still don't remember them. I remember the person, but not the name. In school, I almost never knew any teacher's name and it took me several years to learn the names of most of the other children.<p>This also means that you can't have a ""One True Most Readable Style"". You only have several local maximums for different classes of people.",1354647415

These things contradict each other. loaddata uses your models, which will be potentially out of date. We have had to manually load up the fixture using json.loads, then create the model instances using orm.Foo and setattr.<p>Also, not a great solution, but we monkeypatched south to simply use the number in the file name, ie 0001.py. This way if two developers try to commit a migration, they cause a conflict, and we can fix it then instead of finding out later. It makes the filename less friendly, but we usually use grep/ack to find a migration anyways.",1354647380

I could see not investing initially when it was unclear if tablets were a fad or not but it is now well past the point where people should be arguing that they are 'just a fad' (I don't know that anyone does any more, just saying that if they did, it would be silly) and Google can (and has) executed really well in the past in response to things that could be solved by pushing out more ECMAscript code to the web site.

Your statement I quoted above directly reflects the sentiment I was attempting to direct towards 'the Twittershphere'.<p>> 1. You never know who has actually organized a conference,<p>You may have indadvertently overstated your case here. For example, the organizers of this conference are listed at the bottom of the page linked above!<p>> 2. That's not a relevant counter argument<p>I recognize that most of my original comment is basically an ad-hominem attack on anyone critical of conference organizers. I failed to clearly state what I would consider to be an appropriate response: sharing constructive criticism via private channels such as email, phone calls, etc. with a particular emphasis on providing immediately workable solutions. Twitter has repeatedly failed as an initial channel for constructive feedback on serious issues, but is certainly recommended as a fallback should the time come to 'name and shame'.",1354647354

For self-hosted comment sections I have to either ""sign up"" for every individual blog I want to comment on or tie my real identity to my comments for convenience.

With a self-hosted comment section I'd have to check the comments section of several blogs constantly or subscribe to some kind of comment RSS feed, which is not ideal at all.<p>Hacker news can be substituted for ""A service like Disqus"" in the last two paragraphs.<p>For these reasons, I might decide to not reply at all, even though I might have something relevant and interesting to say.<p>I'd like to hear your reasons for hosting comments yourself though, as I can't think of any good ones myself that render the arguments I laid out here irrelevant.",1354646509

4872481,comment,4870875,4871814,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"One of the interesting side effects of plasma streams impacting the atmosphere is that they transfer kinetic energy. Early models of the climate (I've not checked the most recent one the IPCC is endorsing) were strictly radiation based (how much energy is absorbed by atmosphere, ground, how much is reflected, and re-radiated off) generally kinetic effects were considered minor or immaterial because the magnetic field deflects most of the solar wind. So when a CME heads our way, the ""mass"" gets pushed aside by magnetic repulsion and the energy transfer is minimal (some angular velocity imparted to the planet). But if the mass is <i>not</i> moved aside and impacts the atmosphere directly, it transfers its kinetic energy to the atmospheric gas which comes back as a net rise in temperature.<p>If the effect is significant it could inform observations on solar activity and climate that were previously missing a plausible theory for connecting them. These 'portals' have the nice property that you can map them with a satellite and you can then correlate those maps with atmospheric effects. That should help us with the models we're using.",1354646496

The whole thing was actually a huge waste, the opposite of what ""lean"" is supposed to be about, ironically.<p>Since we use everything we create in house, it's very obvious when actual value isn't being created, and pivoting, A/B tests, and the like gave essentially useless results, or at best, trivial results, and produced no value.<p>That's why we dropped it.<p>I didn't understand <i>why</i> it didn't work for us until I read Thiel's axis of startups, and discovered that Reis' approach isn't targeted at companies or people like me.<p>I think his <i>goals</i> are fine (really, does anyone disagree with them?), but his practices only apply to specific kinds of people/companies, in my experience.

But (going a little off-topic) I sometimes see this extended here on HN towards the attitude that we don't have any responsibility towards the third world, and the best thing we could do to help them is to stay away. With that I disagree.  First worlders have advanced maths and superior computing power which, in many cases, allows for strictly  better design given the same materials. Take antennas for an example - there is a whole branch of science built around it that amounts to discovering even more imaginative ways of bending metal rods[0]. I do strongly agree with anonymfus below [1] that we shouldn't hook the third world up to our industry and sell them things they can't hope to produce or maintain, but we do have an <i>enormous</i> amount of knowledge about pretty much everything; knowledge they could use to vastly improve their lives. So I'm all for co-operation between people from both worlds.<p>[0] - by the way, I find this to be an amazing example of the power of human thought - we're basically bending pieces of scrap metal, turning stuff that was worthless few hundred years ago into something very useful, and quite often expensive.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4871692"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4871692</a>",1354645942

Fact is, hosting servers costs money, and developing optimized software costs money and time. The pirated copies are costing them money without giving them anything in return. On top of that, a lot of these people might have paid for the game if they had not been able to get it free.<p>As a game dev you are going to have an awful lot of things on your mind that are more important than optimizing a system that currently works. This is business reality. Obviously, this could have been an ""excuse"" to shutter a poorly-constructed game, but I totally believe that the load from copies freely obtained (against the developers' wishes) made their product untenable. All their blood, sweat, and tears, wasted.<p>I feel deeply about software piracy.<p>Piracy disrespects the software developers. The developers worked hard to produce something and you tell them that there code is worth $0.00. I'm extremely offended that people pirate code.<p>The key is that <i>they asked for money and you told them no.</i> It's one thing for someone to offer their software for free, it's another thing for someone to say, ""I need money to develop this,"" and you tell them ""No, your software isn't worth that."" Maybe you didn't mean that. It's like slapping someone in the face and telling them that you really didn't mean it that way.<p>I'm absolutely shocked that comments in this thread insist that it's the responsibility of the developers to either throw up an authentication wall (think about the conversion losses!) or just handle thousands of people using their software for free. That's precious development time that they've spent on premature optimization when they could have built better features for paying customers.<p>I'll wager that 95% of the developers commenting here actually get paid for their code in some way, shape, or fashion. Why wouldn't you want to pay for someone else's code? Why do you have a kneejerk reaction when other people don't want to pay to use others' code?<p>I go out of my way to support free code if there's a donate button. Nearly every time I see a donate button I click it. I used Readability before their donations fell apart. I have a gittip account. I respect developers and the time it takes to create code, so I pay the price.<p>I assume the people reading this are like me. You also donate to open source projects and buy the paid version when possible, once you've tried the game. However, the rank and file of people who are pirating software probably do not.<p>Even though copying code is cheap, piracy takes a toll on the company:\n- It often takes away potential sales.\n- Pirated copies are often sub-par and can tarnish your brand. Some developers might not realize how important brand is, but just consider how many millions of dollars are spent to build brand for these companies.\n- In this case, pirating imposed an unbearable load on servers. They had to shutter the game.<p>I am all about open source and donate whenever possible. I totally understand that, for example, patents are just ridiculously overplayed in today's world. However, software piracy offends me deeply. I think it ought to offend other developers as well, but you are free to hold whatever opinion you like.",1354644607

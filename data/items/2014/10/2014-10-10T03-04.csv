Any time you have about ~1% features being present, it can make a difference. Example: if you have about 5 of 500 fields with 16 possible values represented, storing all the 0s is expensive. Using a naive 4-bits-per-field, you end up with 2000 bits, whereas, using my method, you only use ~620. Even using a 500bit number to flag which fields are present and then listing just those fields in order only saves you about ~100 bits over my method.<p>Plus, I manage to spark off a discussion about math and the problem, rather than just whining about it being hard, which I consider to be a good thing.",1412913566

I actually make use of an old Power Mac G3 (B&W) running Mac OS 9 for connecting to some IRC servers (using ircle) and in its case, at least, nicks are assumed to be 10 characters or less. This is quite annoying since there are active users on the channels who have nicks longer than that, so the client simply displays their messages with the extra characters of their nick cut off (to keep the messages left aligned). While I suppose ircle could dynamically resize the area for nicks based on the length of the longest nick that has posted a message, that could be pretty inefficient… not to mention if the channel messages are being logged in a text file with messages left-aligned in there as well (which is what ircle does); the whole file would have to be recreated.",1412912735

8436148,comment,8434409,8435308,0,0,WalterBright,,,"The reason for &quot;weakly pure&quot; was first discovered by Don Clugston (as far as I can tell). Suppose I have a struct with a member function:<p><pre><code>    struct S { int s; pure void set(int i) { s = i; }
</code></pre>
Now, even in a strongly pure function, I can use the weakly pure function even though it is mutating state through its arguments:<p><pre><code>    pure int foo(int i) {
        S s;
        s.set(i);
        ...
        return whatever;

8436138,comment,8435548,8435823,0,0,ChristopherM,,,"The company I spoke of did have a yearly review process, I also waited for that yearly review to come up before I objected to the pathetic raises which barely tracked inflation.  When one starts out at entry level, one should quickly gain significant raises commensurate with ones skills and abilities.  This company clearly tried to get away with doing as little as possible, I also happened to know that senior software engineers at that company in Colorado were making $120k+.  Had I kept my mouth shut, sure, in a decade or two I also would have been making $120k+ but in 2020&#x27;s dollars not 2000&#x27;s dollars.  The actual salary doesn&#x27;t matter as much as what those dollars can buy.<p>As for Microsoft, I have no idea how their process works or if they even reward ambition and results.  I did work for a larger company later, 6 months in they gave me a $13k raise and 6 months after that another $20k raise when they made me a manager.  I never once brought up my salary, what I did do was point out what I thought was being done wrong and then proposed how to fix it.  In this case I went to the CTO as my manager really wasn&#x27;t managing the product at all, I thanked him for hiring me but told him I didn&#x27;t think I was going to stay.  He asked why and I described what it was we were doing and all the problems it was causing.  I then followed it up with a solution of how to manage the product.  I did not expect, nor even go in there with thoughts of taking over my manager&#x27;s job.  It was just an honest assessment of how to fix and drastically improve the efficiency of the group.  One week later the CTO came to see me, privately.  He told me they were very impressed with the work I was doing and they wanted to give me the opportunity to manage the product and the engineers working on that project.  The first 6 months were probationary, after that I would be made full manager and get a salary increase.  At that company, I never needed to negotiate my salary.  They were always generous, they listened and were very proactive in keeping their employees happy.<p>In general though, my experience has been more like the first job.  The companies, while having a yearly review process are very stingy.  When it&#x27;s time to hire a manager they bring in someone from the outside as they don&#x27;t want to hire another engineer and retrain them.<p>As for Ben Horowitz&#x27;s article, I would have quickly left any company that followed his advice.  Telling me to wait, the company policies etc.  I would see them for what they are, a stalling tactic.  I would recognize that I was being &quot;handled&quot;.  With me I voice my opinion, I lay out the facts.  If they are ignored, I don&#x27;t complain, I don&#x27;t bring it up again.  I just quietly look for a new job, and any counter-offers after that point are immediately turned down.

And that, I think, might be one of the additional super powers, that quite frankly, women who don&#x27;t ask for a raise have. Because that&#x27;s good karma, it&#x27;ll come back! Because somebody&#x27;s going to know, &#x27;That&#x27;s the kind of person, that I want trust.&#x27;&quot;<p>He&#x27;s assigning good karma to a lack of assertiveness in women.",1412910087

Then when I ask about the basics like target market, retention metrics, customer feedback etc - I get a bunch of blank stares.<p>It&#x27;s no good driving more traffic or &quot;virality&quot; when people aren&#x27;t interested in your startup in the first place. I&#x27;d say in 9 out of 10 cases, there&#x27;s still a ton of PM fit work to be done by startups who think they are in the &quot;growth hacking&quot; stage.<p>The problem is, I&#x27;d say most first-time entrepreneurs just think the only obstacle they need to overcome is getting more people seeing their website, or downloading their app. It&#x27;s hard to accept that your startup is not ready for growth because it&#x27;s not providing any clear value yet.",1412910006

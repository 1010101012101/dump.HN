I call it ""the feel good factor"" entrepreneurship is supposed to be hard work nothing simple.<p>Like the guy who used markups in the 90's, I come from the school that seeks a point of pain and then start working your way into solutions.<p>I learned this from the advertising agencies where I worked a few years ago. Client came in with a problem, specified the problem and the particular need for a solution and wrote this out in something called ""a creative brief"" we took this info, worked our way into sketches, prototypes and then convinced the client that we had a solution.<p>Convincing the client meant conducting independent customer research and validation.<p>Lots of iterations where done but at no point did we push, shove or even seek to misled clients for the sake of validating our ideas without hard work done.<p>I like customer validation. I use it everyday. But I want to do my research and some hard work and then let the customer guide my way. Real MVP and real customers and then we can do all the supper stuff.

However, the price discrimination decision is made by the institution, and it clearly has benefits to the institution.<p>In addition to raising more money, price discrimination also serves to attract better students by competing aggressively on price for students who are good but price sensitive. In this sense, the average student benefits from price discrimination.<p>Finally, even raising prices for the least price sensitive students increases the tuition to a small fraction of the true economic cost of education.  For example, at the private school I attended the $30k/yr of tuition (this was 10yrs ago) covered approximately half of the $60k/yr per student it cost to run the school (the rest came out of the endowmment).

The separation of the database team from the development team introduces communication problems, priority mismatches, and fixes done on one side or the other that should have been made on the other side. If you are reading this and you have separate database and development teams, merge them now, or at the least, put control of the schema in the hands of the development team.",1259014340

Non deterministic computation -> remembering last value of m and n. I assume you are talikng pseudo random generators here.<p>2. error handling with Maybe -> remembering last value or Nothing.

I  am unwilling to submit to this McCarthy-style investigation of my scientific research... I will continue to refuse such data requests in the future.

I stopped playing their No-Limit Texas Hold-em poker app because I was suspicious that it was rigged.<p>I thought that maybe I was just a typical unlucky player who would make such a claim. I feel less sure of that after seeing the ""every horrible thing in the book"" remark.<p>I think the sleazy tactic would be to hook new players onto the game by weighting the odds in their favor.<p>For those who care... what I saw was a lucky streak when I started playing. For my style of play, that meant good hands and good flops. After a few weeks, I started seeing that people were regularly getting sucked out on and losing to very rare hands on a frequent basis. Yes, the former can be blamed on the quality and aggression levels of Internet users playing without consequence (i.e. real money). I couldn't explain the latter.<p>I saw players call very high bets on the flop and turn and end up with runner-runner straights or flushes on the river. It <i>felt</i> like the game might be rewarding stupidity more often than any decent pseudo-random number generation would dictate. Again, this could just be because a higher number of stupid hands are played in their game than IRL but I think I accounted for the probabilities in my incredulity.<p>Most damning was that I played for about about 3 hours over a 48 hour period and saw a straight flush and 3 4-of-a-kinds. I've played 4 hours a week of ""bar poker"" (play for chips, not money) for 1 1/2 years and have seen 2 straight flushes and 2 4-of-a-kinds total that whole time at the real tables. They're (supposed to be) rare enough that I can recall each instance with clarity.",1259013950

FB and Google both offer a lot of other services beyond <i>just</i> chat. FB offers photo sharing, the newsfeed, potential for correct address books (at least with people that share that info with their friends), event organizing, games. I&#x27;m not that into it, but I know a lot of people that are. Then Google offers Google Mail, Docs, Hangouts, Calendar, Drive. I think they have their own image sharing system (I don&#x27;t take many photos, so those features are nearly useless to me). Their chat protocols are more of a side-effect of having something already associated with your identity. Opening them up to federation likely won&#x27;t cost them many users (and those users it does cost them will likely be as inactive on all their other services as I am), but has the potential to gain goodwill and endorsement from other circles (particularly those people that others -- family, friends -- go to for tech advice).",1391111928

7152967,comment,7151626,7152786,1,0,Zancarius,,,"> But desalination isn&#x27;t that kind of technology — it&#x27;s the destructive kind.<p>But is it really? You&#x27;re effectively doing what occurs in nature. Clearing land and building a distribution infrastructure is destructive, but certainly no more than what is already going to happen regardless of whether or not desalinization is used. Pumping from salt water aquifers might qualify as well.<p>> My question was genuine.<p>It was, but your comment seemed dismissive of alternatives. I don&#x27;t think that objectively adds anything to the conversation. I apologize if that wasn&#x27;t your intent.<p>I can see a solar desalinization system in place in areas where much of the water you encounter underground is brine or otherwise non-potable, and it&#x27;s particularly useful in areas where other methods of collection won&#x27;t work. Yes, it has the potential drawback of kicking the can farther down the road in terms of <i>potentially</i> extracting water faster than it&#x27;s replaced. But that said, in much of the west, the topography lends itself well to draining much of the run off into large basins and water ingress likely far outpaces whatever could be pumped out of the ground. Perhaps a hybrid (rainfall collection + solar desalinization) would be ideal.<p>I think you&#x27;re focusing exclusively on the advertised &quot;seawater greenhouse&quot; and may not be aware of the benefits such a design would have in areas where there certainly is plentiful salt water, just not from a sea.",1391111914

I guess there won&#x27;t be many with c++ solutions.<p>I only found the challenge two days before the end. My goal with the challenge was not to get the best solution, but rather use it as an exercise to practice the different languages and finding intuitive solutions.<p>Level 0 as you wrote was really just a two line change.<p>Level 1 was fun, because I tried to work with the existing bash structure as far as possible and just replaced the hot loop with inline python (something new learned). I found it interesting that this way I could directly inject the variables into the python program without having to load them as env variables (see [1]).<p>In Level 2 I did too much work, I did not think simple enough. I assumed that the different test cases would differ a lot and that a static divider would not help. My assumption was that the histogram of requests per second across the different IPs would have a bimodal distribution[2], thus I used the excellent &quot;fast-stats&quot; library to get a histogram and ban clients based on that. The library even offers approximate histograms, so even if there would be thousands of requests it would still scale.<p>To solve Level 3 with the given code required to changes:<p>-(i) Partitioning the data across the three server. I only loaded a subset of the files based on the server id (which was conveniently already available in the search servers) and<p>-(ii) Loading the files in memory so that they don&#x27;t have to be read from disk for every search term. This was enough to pass this level. The code was too long for the gist but I can put it on github if someone wants to take a look at it. No fancy index structure required. I just scanned The files linearly on each request.<p>Mastering Level 4 was not possible for me, I tried working with the go-raft library and got the integration with unix sockets working, but somehow the system got unstable after a while. Fixing this was really frustrating and in the end I gave up because I could not find the problem and time was running out.<p>I congratulate all ~200 persons which also passed this last level.

If I rely on raw JS, then I&#x27;m one glitchy browser implementation away from being broken.<p>Even worse: suppose you build a product with the approach you recommend, it&#x27;s very successful, and then your sales team makes a major sale to a stodgy old bank that still uses IE7.  Or maybe you just never make the sale because you don&#x27;t support the browser they use.<p>OK, let&#x27;s say we should all turn away money from IE7 users because it&#x27;s insecure and old.  For OP&#x27;s strategy to work, we have to assume all browsers we care about will be compatible going forward.  I think this is a very unsafe assumption to make.  While one small incompatibility would only be a minor annoyance, once you have more than a handful of these, a compatibility layer like jQuery again looks very nice.<p>And none of this even speaks to the fact that the jQuery implementation in the source article is generally at least as short and readable as the alternative, or that most people are more familiar with the jQuery version.<p>The only reason I can think of for dumping jQuery is maybe speed optimization, and even in that case, well-implemented jQuery should be no slower than the native speed plus the cost of a function call.  If it&#x27;s slow and you want to optimize something, why not optimize/bug-fix jQuery itself and help everyone, not just your one project?",1391109998

I think conservation is a necessity that few appreciate (having lived in a desert all my life, I have a certain appreciation for scarce resources), but comments like the one you replied to are exactly the kind we don&#x27;t need. That is, dismissal of alternate solutions isn&#x27;t going to help the problem get any better.<p>Out here, there&#x27;s a large, untapped reservoir of brine that would be ample water to supply the neighboring communities for decades or more. The local government continues to humor bonds to build a desalinization plant every 10 years with conditions that the money will be redirected after 3 years if the plant isn&#x27;t built, and unsurprisingly, the plant is never built. These greenhouses, if they work, would be a worthwhile experiment and probably substantially cheaper considering the wider variety of crops that could be grown and sold. Not to mention local growers could continue growing their crops without ruining the freshwater wells of their neighbors by running them dry. I just doubt it&#x27;ll happen until the cost of pumping fresh water becomes too expensive or the wells are run completely dry.",1391108752

The main issue with being poor (speaking from experience) is the unavoidable fact that an unexpected outlay of $$ (car repair or trip to the doctor or parking ticket or broken water heater) can have such a profound effect on your finances, one which you may not recover from.  The reality is that when you are poor, living pay check to paycheck, the margins are beyond fine.  There is no second chance when life strikes, so the daily stress you feel is intense and surely has an effect on your state of mind. Soon you begin to feel trapped and that is when hope becomes a memory with survival the only concern. I feel fortunate to not have those stresses anymore and can tell you that the stresses I feel now are significantly less stressful in comparison. Stresses now could ruin my day but not my life (barring the most catastrophic events). When you are poor, everything $$ is significant and can have a radical impact on your life.",1391108501

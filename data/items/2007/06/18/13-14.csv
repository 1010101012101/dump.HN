28855,comment,28848,28848,0,0,willarson,,,"There is a lot of buzz recently for outsourcing software development (thank you Guy Kawasaki), and it still bothers me somewhat. At one point someone made the observation that outsourcing tech is fine as long as tech isn't supposed to be your core speciality.<p>\nI can't imagine outsourcing the foundation of a project that I might have to work on for years to come. Maybe this is a bit overly romantic, and it would be more efficient to outsource the initial version, and build a custom one if and only if interest emerges.<p>\nMuch of my discomfort about the outsourcing stems from the fact that these people are charging 5-10k and taking 4-8 weeks to build something really unspectacular.

I never really used any one of the startups everybody's talking about, except maybe Flickr, but then Flickr wasn't created by kids.<p>On the other hand, adults, however slow, are capable of creating systems for everyone, if they are capable of anything at all.<p>And most importantly, adults can build infrasrtuctures on top of which kids can play their games. See the difference? Or show me a protocol, a platform, or a decent programming language created by a 15 year old.",1182173104

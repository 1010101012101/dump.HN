6388698,comment,6388634,6388634,4,0,onion2k,,,"This is actually a solved problem in some industries using a technique called &quot;3 point analysis&quot;. I&#x27;ve no idea why it hasn&#x27;t really caught on among developers; it&#x27;s very useful. Essentially it goes like this:<p>1. Estimate the very best possible outcome. How long would something take if everything went to plan?<p>2. Estimate the very worst possible outcome. If everything that can go wrong does, how long will the task take?<p>3. Estimate the most likely outcome. Knowing what you do about the client, the task, the tech, etc, how long is it likely to take.<p>(Point 3 is the normal way of estimating.)<p>The advantage of 3 point analysis is that you can use the difference between the times to estimate risk. If the best and worst outcomes are similar, then there&#x27;s little risk of things going horribly wrong. If the best and the likely times are similar but the worst is much longer then there&#x27;s something that can completely screw up - identify what that is and defend against it. If the likely and worst times are similar but the best time is much shorter, identify why that&#x27;s the case and try to make sure it happens. And so on.<p>Better yet, by taking the aggregate best times for a set of requirements and comparing it against the worst, you can get a good view of the overall risk of a project.<p>Very useful indeed.",1379242508

6388691,comment,6388512,6388512,48,0,pron,,,"Far be it from me to say that the choice of programming language doesn&#x27;t matter, or that picking one slightly off the trodden path is not a sign of a certain openness of mind. I also think that Clojure is particularly enjoyable, elegant and beautiful, while at the same time extremely practical, easy to learn, and well suited to modern application development; it is the best designed programming language I have encountered in my almost-two-decades-long programming career (with Julia giving it a run for its money if only it had been implemented on top of the JVM as well).<p><i>However</i>, I&#x27;ve seen a clear inverse correlation between the magnitude of technical challenge and the emphasis on the choice of programming language. It is usually web application developers that spend the time and effort picking what they deem to be a modern, or &quot;more productive&quot; programming language. It is as it should be, because most productive languages, Clojure included, are usually more productive for <i>applications</i>  not complex basic algorithms, or the development of novel data structures. Application developers spend 90% or more of their time writing and debugging production code, so they&#x27;d better spend some time picking and learning a language that makes their work easier.<p>But people in the fields of computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, concurrent data-structures and others  very smart, very forward thinking people  would pick Java or C/C++ nine times out of ten, and not only because these languages are better suited to their task performance-wise, but because they have other, more important things to think about. If your challenge is not translating a business model into code, but solving a real algorithmic or technical problem, then the programming language really doesn&#x27;t matter, and you&#x27;re better off sticking with the one(s) you know best.<p>If 95% of your time is spent thinking anyway, it doesn&#x27;t matter if your language can reduce the remaining 5% of actual development by a factor of two or more. IBM&#x27;s Watson would not have come about sooner if its engineers had chosen Haskell over Java.<p>ADD.: 
&quot;Productive&quot; programming language are better when you need to solve the same problem over and over (say retrieve data from a database and generate HTML). But when your problem is more or less one-of-a-kind, these productivity boosts either disappear or don&#x27;t matter. When you&#x27;re handcrafting a magnificent chair, picking the best assembly line is irrelevant. Chances are it&#x27;s been designed to solve other problems and retrofitting it to your requirements is extra work, and even if it wasn&#x27;t, this chair need only be made once. Mass production tools are unnecessary.",1379242431

And the reason why I mention this is that many Lisps have FFI which makes integrating those libraries almost seamless. Aside from Gambit-C, which compiles Scheme code to C and so supports inline C code, for example Racket has very nice DSSL for FFI, which reduces the need for glue code to one or two lines of code per imported function.<p>Integration with native Java libraries is easier from JVM languages, of course, but then there are many Lisps for JVM too. And for CLR, where tail call elimination exists. So if you want to write in Lisp, but are worried about lack of libraries, you really have many options.

It is a perfectly rational alternative policy to bring a smaller number of prosecutions, and to compensate defendants for their costs, wasted time and distress, if a prosecution fails.<p>I&#x27;m not well versed in the details, but I understand you can reclaim certain costs incurred in defending yourself in such cases.<p>It is, alas, completely impracticable to cover all costs, as many of the costs (compensation for the distress caused, time spent worrying about the case, etc.) are non-pecuniary.<p>Hence defending an accusation will always be costly. No one is ever going to come out of a court case, even when proven innocent, thinking the whole experience had a net positive impact on their life.<p>> You might like to look up some of the published data about the proportion of appeals that succeed against things like local-authority-issued parking tickets and ANPR-based congestion charges. It happens all the time, and erroneous charges aren&#x27;t even close to the kind of isolated incidents you seem to believe they are.<p>That&#x27;s what I was referring to in the subsequent qualification. People routinely get off the hook for such infractions on technicalities, but that doesn&#x27;t render the initial accusation baseless.<p>Generally speaking, the person will have been at the location on the given date, doing something or other that gave the authority good reason to issue them with a fine.<p>If they were not, it is usually a reasonable misunderstanding (e.g. cloned plates, stolen car, taken without owner&#x27;s consent, ANPR system mis-read a plate) and relatively straightforward to clear up.<p>> Whether it was malicious on the part of the authorities or their enforcement people just got duped as in the cloning case you mentioned makes no difference at all to an innocent third party who gets slapped with a penalty notice they didn&#x27;t deserve.<p>What else are you going to do? Stop issuing penalties for motoring offences full-stop because a tiny percentage of vehicles on the road are stolen, or taken without the owners&#x27; consent, or have cloned plates, and thus issuing a penalty to the owner will stress them out?",1379240072

182407,comment,182369,182369,0,0,subwindow,,,"Not to sound blunt, but you can charge whatever you feel you're worth.  I've never had a client blink when I told them what my hourly rate was.  They do a calculation in their head, but it is not ""Is this too expensive?"" but it is ""Do I think this guy is worth it?""  Chances are if you yourself feel that you're worth that amount, they will too.<p>That said, DB consultants generally make a bit more because of the fragility and messiness of what they deal with.  I've done some Oracle consulting at $100/hr and that, I realize now, was a very low rate.",1210078765
182406,comment,182280,182395,0,0,axod,,,"Sure, but IMHO forum posts (ASK YC:) etc, are not really links. They're forum posts - I'm not sure of the value added by lumping them in with news stories/links/articles. By doing this, the forum posts don't seem to get the attention they actually deserve.<p>Personally I think separating it and having a specific forum for startup topics would really improve things.",1210078651

182403,comment,182369,182369,0,0,mfruhling,,,"I've done consulting on the microsoft stack and I got between $50/hr and $75/hr on short term gigs.  I was also considered on the cheap side by the people who hired me.  I think price is greatly determined by whether you're coming from a company or you're an individual.  Customers will pay a consulting firm $150-$200/hr or more because they are also buying someone to blame if the project goes wrong.  An individual is not going to see that amount.  My advice would be to market yourself as a consulting company, even if that is just some of your friends loosely affiliating yourselves with one another.  You will get higher rates that way.  Another way to higher rates is to have a business domain(s) that you can be considered knowledgeable in.  Domain knowledge will separate you from the pack when someone is price shopping, and that knowledge or experience really does make you much more valuable and efficient.",1210078385

Seriously, I've seen this kind of stuff happen a couple of times before and it always works fine. There is a need for something that cannot be solved in any other way : less traffic.<p>From what I've seen before, this works like a charm. Everybody keeps up visiting the main site, but the few that needs more focus start to feed the second portal. Interesting stories of the second portal will get into the main one, adding value to submissions. Win-Win.<p>Remember the early days of HN ? There is a need for this kind of environment that disappeared when HN got popular. So make a second portal running, announce it, and it'll take off slowly effortlessly.",1210077136

In other words, if a progress  is reported by an AI researcher, it doesn't mean anything.<p>There are many forms of intelligence and for example Turing machines are just one, probably.

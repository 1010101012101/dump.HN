If you plan to seek funding and investments, then incorporating in DE is in your long-term best interests.  If you plan to bootstrap things and keep it more simple, then the state you incorporate in is less significant, as you won't really be doing much from a legal perspective.<p>As far as registering in the multiple states that is also more important when there is actual cash flow.  If you're in the early stages of development and cash burn, there is less valuable in making your legal work more burdensome.",1216821367

A site I'd built for a client was sued by Channel Intelligence in their mass filing last week (TechCrunch covered it) for their revolutionary and genius idea of ""configuring a database system to store information regarding a plurality of items,"" focusing on wishlists.<p>The client (#12 in the suit if you're curious) called me in a panic telling me to pull down the site, so all its users are screwed. I've also run a free wishlist site at GreedyMe.com for several years which wasn't named in the suit, but if it had been, I couldn't financially justify trying to fight it.<p>PageRank was pretty revolutionary. I'm on the fence as to whether that should be patented. Amazon's 1-Click and Channel Intelligence's ""list storage"" are obvious methods, and I can't fathom how any lawyer or businessman can submit a patent for such nonsense with a straight face.",1216820177

254295,comment,254107,254107,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>Rather, people with a naturally anti-authoritarian attitude tend to become attracted to programming.</i><p>I was actually a staunch progressive before entering the startup world.  A few things turned me into a libertarian:<p>1) I realized that nearly every instance of what my college professors called a ""market failure"" was really an instance where there was a web of government regulations preventing me from starting a business to solve the problem ( such as health insurance, education, or corporate governance).  Once you stop thinking, ""How could the government solve this problem?"" and start thinking, ""How can I start a business to solve this problem?""  your perspective on the world change dramatically.<p>2)  The software industry is so new it hasn't had the time to earn government favors and protection.  Thus an engineer pays a lot to the government, but gets virtually nothing in return.  Other professions used to be this way, and were much more libertarian ( farmers being the original case, but also doctors, bankers, etc.).  Long ago those professions started getting either direct government funding or laws protecting entry into their industry. They became dependent on government.  Engineers are also wealthy enough that they are net losers from income redistribution.  And finally, by working in the startup world, most engineers see the free market at its best, rather than only seeing the soulless corporate side.<p>3)  I decided to actually read about this ""Austrian economics"" nonsense.  I read a bunch of books from both sides and scoured the internet for arguments and counter-arguments.  At the end, I was shocked to realize that Ron Paul was right.  Before, I thought he was a nut-job and Austrians were just ignoramuses who had never even taken a college macroeconomics course.  After, I was ready to don my tin foil hat :-)",1216820051

254286,comment,254231,254231,0,0,jm4,,,"I've used Spring but not Spring MVC so I can't comment on their web framework. I have used WebWork which became Struts 2. I think Java web development is complicated and tedious under the best of circumstances, but as far as Java web frameworks are concerned WebWork/Struts2 is decent.<p>You're going to have lots of files. You're going to have at least several hundred lines of XML even for a small application. This is par for the course in the Java world. The upside is that the documentation available is generally very good and it's also very easy to navigate your way around the application. Another plus is that Struts is kind of the de facto standard framework for many Java developers so it's easy to find help.<p>You might also want to check out Stripes if you like Struts2. I like to think of it as a better Struts2. It follows more of a convention over configuration model while still being at least as flexible as Struts2. The result is less code, faster development and no XML. It also has the benefit of being so similar to Struts that any developer familiar with one can quickly pick up the other.<p>Wicket is interesting too and probably worth a look. There was also a framework called RIFE that looked like it had potential, but the documentation was absolutely atrocious when I looked at it about a year ago.",1216819273

The main pillars are three different folders:<p>1) INBOX - unprocessed input, usually files downloaded from the web or saved attachments.<p>2) PROJECTS - here, I create subfolders, one subfolder for one Project. In the subfolders, there are files I actively work on, like doc files.<p>3) REFERENCES - here, I store files I am not working on, like ebooks, texts, photos, etc.<p>So, in the slide example, I would not lost the file location, since I know it will be in the folder Projects\Write-Essay-On-Teaching.

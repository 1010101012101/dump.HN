Spam is a real and serious problem, and we dilute the importance of fighting it when we call anything remotely commercial as spam.<p>A blog has the right to make money. How? Typically ads and affiliate offers. As long as there is disclosure for both, I see nothing wrong with their use. OP wrote a review of a product and then submitted it to HN. People liked the review and therefore up-voted it. I think that's totally fair. Or are you suggesting that the OP is gaming the site?<p>The lack of comments may be explained by the fact that people didn't have much to add about the product, they are afraid of being labelled as SEO people, or they are simply toying with SEOmoz after reading the review.<p>HN-Books.com looks like a site dedicated to (mostly) book reviews. I don't see 10 posts a day from it, so I think it's totally okay.<p>I'm not crazy about bit.ly either in principle (for the reasons that you said) but again, the OP is definitely within his rights to use that service if he wants. Redirect links can be used for tracking purposes, for convenience, or very honestly for increasing one's conversions rates. Even in the latter case, I fail to see a problem with it.<p>If you don't like the content, ignore it (and if it's bona fide spam, then flag it by all means). If you like the content, but not the conditions under which it is provided, use AdBlock and don't click on the links. Screaming ""spam"" every time ""commercial-ish"" blog entries are posted is uncharacteristic and unbecoming of a community of entrepreneurs.",1297709896

I agree with everything you have said.<p>And yet it is also true that the end-users can have a significant amount of influence in how quickly the marketplace provides more choice and more open solutions.  Most immediately they can choose the more open solution instead of the one that provides more of a walled garden (such as selecting android over the iphone).  They can, at least in less capital intensive fields, choose to enter themselves and provide a more open solution (as certain Linux providers have done).  In the extreme, they can lobby for legislation or regulation to require or at least support openness and choice.  While I generally support a very light regulatory touch, there are some rare and extreme cases where it is appropriate.<p>While everything you say is true, those who wish to resist walled gardens and proprietary traps can choose to do so in an active and conscious way, rather than merely waiting for the inevitable (yet sometimes slow) march of technology to bring this openness.",1297709765

Can be found here - http://joncrawford.com/how-i-got-kicked-out-of-y-combinator-and-rais<p>I checked out his business at storenvy and was alarmed and disturbed by what I saw. I only looked at a few pages, but their are many to go thru.

http://lovelessapparel.storenvy.com/products/1111-revolt<p>I am having a hard time believing how such A-List investors can be affiliated with this kind of company. One can make an argument that the items in question are posted by users and not the views of Storevny. However, does storenvy not monitor the items on it's website?<p>Also, one of the  brands, Loveless Apparel, is based in Orlando, Florida. Isn't this where Jon's original tshirt printing business, Threadbird.com, is from? Doesn't Threadbird.com print tshirts for Storenvy customers? If that is the case, then can't one assume that Threadbird.com knew exactly what they were printing and allowed it? Then allowed it to be offered it for sale on Storenvy?  If these assumptions are true, then I think there is a problem here. Free speech doesn't give people the right to distribute or market Antisemitism and use an American icon like Mickey Mouse to do so.<p>Why do I care? I did not like they way Mr. Crawford tried to subtly insult the Ycombinator team and belittle them. In addition, the tshirts in question are extremely offensive to me and my grandparents. Don't shoot the messenger.<p>Thank you.

The first time I looked to off-shore my development, I went with traditional off-shore development providers and was severely disappointed. The developers I found had big firm coding experience – having worked on projects for Goog, Msft etc and probably could build software on a consulting basis but just didn't get ""startup"" development. They needed a defined set of requirements within which they could work and needed for those requirements not to change. You can forget about pivoting. This ""big-company, back-office"" mentality obviously won't work for startups. They don't understand agile software development and are terrible with communication. And by communication I don't mean English, that’s usually not the issue; the issue is their approach to communication with a team - closing the loop on emails, replying in a timely manner (or doing anything in a timely manner for that matter) and addressing all the issues you communicate with them.<p>After spending time with 2-3 different teams I changed my approach and started searching for people who were passionate about and contributed to open-source, were active on forums, on Twitter & Fb, and were excited about working on my idea – as opposed to guys wanting to make money from a consulting gig. I found my current developer through such a search and so far it’s been great. There have been some hiccups, but I daresay these aren't issues that would have cropped up even with a team located stateside.<p>So I’m running a distributed company and it’s working out to be very cost-effective - which was the reason I started down this path in the first place. Anyways this is my experience. I may be one of the lucky few; but I do believe that you can find folks with a mentality suited to startups.

I personally have a fairly inclusionist perspective, but my perspective is more or less: Wikipedia should cover anything on which any decent third-party source can be found (and it should point the reader to the source, so they can look it up themselves if they want).<p>There is of course stuff on which internet users can collect useful information, where no current sources exist to cite, but there's no reason Wikipedia has to be the <i>only</i> wiki on the internet. For example, Know Your Meme is an excellent project to document current internet memes, including via original sleuthing by its editors, who try to track down the history of memes and reconstruct their paths. It's not really a tertiary source summarizing the existing literature though; it's a sociological/historical research project. And it's great that it exists. Why does it have to exist <i>on wikipedia.org</i>, a project that has different goals, which don't include doing original research? Of course, memes should also be covered on Wikipedia, but only when Wikipedia can cite some existing published source documenting the information (a news article, a sociology conference paper, anything really).<p>I guess it seems perfectly fine to me that there's more than one project on the internet dedicated to collecting knowledge, with different goals; I don't see why Wikipedia has to be the union of all possible wikis. If anything, I would prefer <i>more</i> projects with different goals and approaches to exist, rather than everything being so centralized. That way I can go to Wikipedia if I want the tertiary-source take on internet memes, and I can go to Know Your Meme if I want the primary-source take on internet memes. Same with a Wikipedia article on a location versus a Wikitravel article on a location: both useful, but I don't see why they have to be merged into one project (or why that would be helpful).",1297706603

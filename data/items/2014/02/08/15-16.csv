Just because you think you&#x27;ve found the highest probability explanation doesn&#x27;t make it true, and thus alternative explanations aren&#x27;t &quot;false&quot; but merely &quot;less likely&quot; Others might disagree with your level of certainty and at this point we&#x27;re all basically spouting opinions, not facts.",1391875178

7201473,comment,7200270,7200475,5,0,callahad,,,"Persona is an awesome way to verify email address ownership, but that&#x27;s only part of what Sync and the Firefox Marketplace need. For instance, Sync needs a user-memorable password for client-side encryption, and Marketplace needs the ability to force users to re-authenticate before a purchase, which is only feasible in a centralized system. Then there are COPPA concerns: We don&#x27;t want to build an age gate into Persona, but we need one on Sync and Marketplace. Firefox Accounts lets us do that once, up front, and be on our merry way.<p>Nevertheless, I&#x27;m hopeful that we&#x27;ll integrate Persona into the Firefox Accounts workflow, but that&#x27;s still only part of the problem that Firefox Accounts is trying to solve. :)<p>(Why wasn&#x27;t it there at first?

It&#x27;s making the assumption that an &quot;illegal operation&quot; is a binary thing deserving of absolute condemnation.

Sorry, you&#x27;re a known litterbug, no one may sell you insulin for your diabetes.<p>And so it is with domain names. You turn off somebody&#x27;s domain name, you&#x27;re taking away their forum to inform the public of your error in wrongly accusing them of misconduct.

You&#x27;re not turning off their infringing operation, you&#x27;re turning off their existence in the communications network.

7201423,comment,7198267,7198267,1,0,joeblau,,,"WOW! Bug Labs, you guys are still around. I remember back in the Summer of 2006 when the BugBox was the hot product.  I was trying to build a real-time geo-tagging service to tag <i>speed traps</i> using the BugBox[1].  Then 6 months later, Steven Paul Jobs came though with the hand of magic, announced the iPhone with all of the sensors that were in the bug box with a much better product and simultaneously erased the Bug Labs from my mind.  As far as <a href=""http://dweet.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dweet.io</a>, this looks like a very good implementation of a message bus.  The two things I&#x27;m worried about with this project are performance and concurrency.<p>Lets start with performance. If you&#x27;re trying to get a predicted 26 billion devices by 2020[2] on a Node.js/Socket.io Framework, you&#x27;re going to need so many machines, the business case wont be viable.  Socket.io is great for  message passing, but at high throughput, it&#x27;s going to fall short.  Message busses like ØMQ (ZeroMQ) are a lot lighter and can bind to file descriptor without requiring spawning up an HTTP server.  As for Node.js performance; It&#x27;s great for JSON serialization (Which you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot of), but it&#x27;s far from the fastest.  Node blows away languages/frameworks like Ruby/Rails and Python/Django in speed when it comes to JSON serialization (And almost anything else), but it&#x27;s still in the 30th percentile for JSON serialization which is very low[3].  With this being one of your most performed operations, this is something that should be as fast as possible.<p>As far as concurrency is concerned; Node.js isn&#x27;t an inherently concurrent language although it does have it&#x27;s non-blocking I/O callback magic.  Obviously, you can use modules like cluster, the native process spawning or backgrounder[4], but the weight of threads is going to be so expensive compared to the amount of work that&#x27;s needed to be preformed.  Supporting concurrent paradigms like RUN.At, RUN.Until, RUN.After, RUN.Every, RUN.WithTimeout, and RUN.BatchJobs are easy to do in Node.js, but then getting those individual processes to talk to each other in an orderly fashion using callbacks and Socket.io seems like duct tape and chewing gum over just using a language that supports concurrency natively.<p>Other than that, I love it, I understand the vision (because we&#x27;re building something similar), and I&#x27;m very glad that you guys open sourced this project.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.vroomtrap.com/downloads"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vroomtrap.com/downloads</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2636073"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2636073</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r8&hw=i7&test=json"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r8&hw=i7...</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://jolira.github.io/backgrounder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jolira.github.io/backgrounder/</a>",1391873994

That&#x27;s a very difficult question to answer.<p>Perhaps thinking in terms of expectations would be better: My expectation is that Mozilla will produce a decent browser, with occasional bumps and steps backwards in response to some <i>flavour du jour</i>, most notably in the area of <i>wouldn&#x27;t it be cools</i> that break usability. Not to mention the mobile browser considering my tablet and phone to be the &quot;same type of device&quot;, when my tablet is much closer to my computer - and it&#x27;s the computer&#x27;s UX I want everywhere, not the phone&#x27;s.<p>My expectation is that Mozilla will produce a half-decent email client that I have no real reason to use.<p>My expectation is that in doing these things Mozilla software will mostly stay out of my way, mostly work as I expect (sync the function works pretty much as expected, sync the UX is awful - I still need all manner of extension and app to get the &quot;move easily from one device to another&quot; experience I really want).<p>My expectation is that Mozilla will occasionally cook up something new, e.g., Persona, that I really don&#x27;t see a need for, and that Mozilla will be unable to articulate why that new thing is needed, cool, or anything else.<p>If Mozilla disappeared tomorrow, I would be quite upset, because FF sucks far less than every other browser - maybe that&#x27;s because I am so used to it, that I&#x27;ve made it work for me, but moving to anything else would be painful. My expectation is that they will continue to deliver excellent B+ software that is adequate to my needs and wants.<p>But why on earth would I expect that I could trust Mozilla with anything more than my sync information?<p>I trust Mozilla about as much as I trust my bank, as much as I trust Google, and, to be fair, more than I trust facebook. But again, trust is the wrong word: I expect Google to mine my information, make the occasional misstep, but to by and large attempt to keep my information safe and secure, because if they don&#x27;t, it ain&#x27;t just mine they release, it&#x27;s millions of ours, and they cannot afford that.<p>I expect my bank to mess up UX occasionally, but to do security reasonably well, and to not share my personal overmuch, because of the regulatory framework in Canada: They just cannot mess this up without serious consequence.<p>I expect facebook to mine, share, intrude, mess around, and generally do stupid things. I am never disappointed.<p>What should I expect of Mozilla Accounts?<p>Nothing. Nothing at all, because &quot;Accounts&quot; is so not what I think of when I think &quot;Mozilla&quot;. I hear &quot;Mozilla&quot; I think &quot;FireFox&quot;, I think half-decent browser, better than others, adequate email client, neither better nor worse, I think confusing cross-device UX...<p>...but do I think trust?<p>Nope.<p>And the &quot;occasional bump in response to something shiny&quot; mentioned above means I never will - at least not without major public rebranding.<p>If I am going to trust you, you need to convince me you are rock-steady reliable, and never prone to blowing with the wind.",1391872417
7201353,story,,,393,178,dieulot,"Show HN: JS library to make your website instant",,"http://instantclick.io/<p>It seems the internet architecture won&#x27;t bring us instant websites anytime soon. So here is a hack.<p>I released this JS library last month (today is version 2.0 release, fixing v1.0&#x27;s rough edges), it makes use of HTML5&#x27;s pushState and preloading to make a website instant.<p>It works like this: before clicking on a link, you&#x27;ll hover over it. And there&#x27;s a delay of 200-300 ms between these two events. InstantClick uses this delay to preload a page, when you click on a link it will display instantly in most case. (You can test on the website.)<p>That&#x27;s similar to pjax and Turbolinks, for it uses HTML5&#x27;s pushState and Ajax. And preloading is thrown into the mix.<p>In case preloading all the links that a user hover over is too much work for the server, there&#x27;s also an option to set a delay before preloading kicks in, or to preload on &quot;mousedown&quot;. Mousedown is when you press your mouse button (a click is when you release it). This way you still get a slight &quot;magical&quot; speed advantage, and pjax&#x27;s benefits (notably, no recalculation of scripts/styles on every page change).<p>For mobile it preloads on touchstart, so you get 400 ms to preload. This is different from FastClick: with InstantClick a user can still double tap to zoom without triggering a link.<p>As said in the first sentence, the internet architecture can&#x27;t bring us instant websites today or tomorrow. So I think this — InstantClick — could be a pretty big thing to improve the situation at scale.<p>The main challenge I see is that existing JS scripts may not work with it out of the box.

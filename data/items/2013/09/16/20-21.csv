From GPLv3/Wikipedia:<p>&#x27;A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#x27;s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.&#x27;<p>In other words, your MIT library is an independent work and does not limit the rights imparted by the other pieces (namely, the GPL pieces).  This is somewhat important since you (presumably) don&#x27;t own the copyright to that MIT work and so your options for relicensing it are limited.<p>Meanwhile, your code is a direct, derivative work of the GPL code and at a minimum, must be made available under the GPL.  You can additionally release under other licenses, provided that those licenses do not conflict with the GPL.  A &quot;public domain&quot; non-license might work.  And again, you must always offer a GPL option.<p>I don&#x27;t know how the AGPL applies here.

We&#x27;ll build a communal building with a shower, kitchen, lounge, and bathrooms. Each owner of the island gets to pick a spot on which to build their own little structure to sleep in. Together we&#x27;ll build infrastructure, gardens, a fire pit, and whatever else we can come up with.</i><p>A couple years ago I bought some rural land with the idea that something like this. . . something I think of as &quot;ecosteading&quot; is going to become a trend of sorts.  The idea that I&#x27;m working on (and have already applied to YC and a bunch of other incubators with) is actually right along this line:  a platform for people to buy and sell land, exchange ideas for ecological homesteading, even build out a platform for more intelligent urban planning.  When it&#x27;s done from the &quot;ground up&quot; (literally), there are all kind of future headaches that can be avoided.<p>Imagine if the Hyperloop or the California high speed rail had been able to be laid down <i>before</i> most of the development around this insanely populated state took place.  Population growth is exponential; it&#x27;s inevitable that we&#x27;re going to need smarter ways of transporting people and consumables.  The key is figuring out where these new hubs of population are going.

Autocorrelation depends on knowing the departure times of the outgoing laser energy and accumulating many samples at the expected return time, which is predictably and reliably related to the transmission time.

6395678,comment,6394892,6395436,4,0,adwf,,,"Two answers that I can think of at first glance:<p>1) A large proportion of the games that I own for Linux are developed using the Unity engine.  This has many advantages for an indie developer (ease of use, cheap license), but is especially useful because it can cross-compile to Windows/Mac/Linux/Android/iOS/Xbox/PS.  Even Blackberry!  This is a godsend for indie developers trying to reach as large a market as possible.<p>So the challenge isn&#x27;t necessarily to get developers to stop using DirectX, but to get the major engine developers (eg. Unreal) to ensure good cross-compilation support.  They already have to a certain extent, because the PS3 is already using a form of OpenGL.  All we really need is a little extra effort from them to make sure it&#x27;s compatible with Linux.  This would immediately add a large proportion of the current game releases to the Linux market.<p>2)  Driver optimisation isn&#x27;t as important as you might think.  The average PC graphics card vastly overtook consoles in graphical power a very long time ago.  Certainly within a year or two of the current generation of consoles.  Even without optimised drivers, they are still far more powerful than the Xbox360 or PS3.<p>All in all, the obstacles are very surmountable.  The biggest problem that I can see lies in convincing the big game engines, like Unreal, to bother with such a small market.  But if Valve leads the way with the Source engine, they could start eating away at the likes of Unreal - simply by being the only AAA choice on Linux.",1379363308

I&#x27;m less of a fan of windmills, but they have their place.<p>Water is indeed the most important infrastructure element to get right, but the solution you go with often depends heavily with your power choices.

Basic games like Tux Racer have taken down my system. Maybe wayland or Mir will fix this.<p>2) Current Compiz / 3D compositing window manager kill 3D performance - The performance hit when running under any of the 3D composting mangers is unacceptable. Maybe wayland or Mir will fix this.<p>3) Video driver situation is abysmal. Nvidia and AMD open source drivers run at a fraction of speed of the proprietary counterparts and are riddled with bugs. Proprietary drivers only work for latest generation cards. Intel has decent open source drivers, but no true gamer would consider using integrated graphics.<p>4) Linux Sound subsystem is a disaster. Sure it&#x27;s fine for listening to music or watching videos, but the latency and CPU usage is unacceptable to real gamers. MS learned their lesson with Vista/Win7 and now have proper hardware acceleration for sound cards in Win8 like they did in WinXP. Linux had their chance to fix this situation with OSSv4 but instead went with the inferior ALSA.<p>I would love to see Ubuntu and Value clean this mess up, but I&#x27;m not sure they have the resources to pull it off.

The biggest thing that can go wrong with this kind of technology is the presence of large magnets or ferrous objects nearby, but even in the roughest environments we&#x27;ve taken the current version of the suit to(mostly conference halls with giant steel beams running through them), we&#x27;ve always been able to calibrate it to work in the environment.  There are also ways to automatically account for temporary magnetic distortions by relying on the gyroscope.<p>Outside of these sorts of distortions, inertial sensing has always seemed like a solid option for mocap to us, and one with a lot less potential for error than an optical or IK based system.  I&#x27;d be glad to hear about any bugs anyone has experienced with inertial sensors in the past, and I can let you know what our system does to alleviate or sidestep those issues.",1379362295

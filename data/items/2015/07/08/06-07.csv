Many of them support privacy, and want surveillance reform. Also, there&#x27;s been a large amount of ongoing public outcry, which keeps leading to more security advances in mass market products.",1436338765

9850176,comment,9844889,9848304,0,0,shoo,,,"> Otherwise my experience is that asking for a general purpose solver is, for now, hopeless.<p>> Instead, for the real problems I&#x27;ve had success with, have to look carefully at the problem and exploit special structure particular to that problem.<p>I am in complete agreement.<p>One way I have thought about this is that, rather informally, &quot;the mapping from problems to solutions is highly discontinuous&quot;. That is, suppose you have a problem statement, and you figure out a method to attack the problem and solve it in practice. Now, vary the problem statement slightly. There is a reasonable chance that the new problem is dramatically harder to solve, and you need a completely different body of theory to even think about it, let alone solve it.<p>For example, suppose you have a polynomial equation in a bunch of complex variables. This is easily solved numerically in practice to any degree of precision you care for. Let&#x27;s reword the problem a little and require that you are only willing to accept integer-valued solutions. Now you&#x27;re talking about Diophantine equations! Have fun!<p>In practice, if you&#x27;re participating in some project to solve business / industrial problems using optimisation, it is pretty common to have the definition of the problem change slightly every few weeks or months, as you learn more about the domain, or as people change their minds, or as the business actually changes what it does. Often you need to figure out clever ways of exploiting the mathematical structure in a particular problem statement to figure out a tractable way of solving the problem. Best to hope that the new version of your problem doesn&#x27;t suddenly break that structure while you&#x27;re &quot;sprinting&quot; towards the next release!",1436338600

They are frequently <i>displeased</i> about vigilantes ruining their operations by doing shit like this - it makes the paedophiles more paranoid and careful, actively disrupting ongoing law enforcement investigations.<p>Fourthly, it&#x27;s not valid research. geek_slop doesn&#x27;t appear to be familiar with how Tor actually works, in fact, they actually list the wonderful exit nodes they got, apparently unaware that the list of exit nodes is <i>public</i> and by design doesn&#x27;t tell you anything at all about the visitors to your site. Web crawlers (including &quot;Dark Web&quot; - a wording which is another sign that the author does not have a strong background in anonymous networks - it&#x27;s correctly &quot;onion site&quot; now, formerly &quot;hidden service&quot;) naturally find <i>related sites</i> that link to each other, if you&#x27;re going by links, which they might have done.

However, we can&#x27;t equate $500B notional of e.g. CDS written against Apple debt with $500B of Google stock.  The CDS represents (1) to the seller, an small initial premium and a large, extremely low-probability liability requiring some collateral, and (2) a stream of future payments from or to the buyer, depending on the cost of insuring the debt.  Up until a credit event, the only money exchanged is the premium, and perhaps some collateral, both of which are (for highly rated debt) orders of magnitude smaller than the notional value of the contract.",1436335288

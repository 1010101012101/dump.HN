A cursory thought in the direction of the project would reveal that the pitch is essentially a) others with tons of experience have invested lots of hard money in this space b) to no real success so far but c) we have the answer and only need a hundred grand to make it large. And d) actually, we don't even need $100k, it's more like $25k plus materials, so as you can see this project is really 99% done now.<p>This is classic hucksterism; you will see it at any business meetup in any town. Somebody has built a better mousetrap in his garage, leaping over giants, and only needs $25k/$50k/$100k to get to market. The key is they never need large sums of money, only relatively small sums to get to market; a larger sum would indicate that the project is not 99% done, which I assure you it is.<p>The obvious question: if you have built a better mousetrap and only need $100k to take over a major industry like lighting, why not go max out your credit cards and just build it? Or show a prototype to anyone over 50 who might be able to connect you with an angel investor? Occam's answer: because you haven't a clue how to make it work.<p>Again, I don't know if the Lifx guys are hucksters. But their pitch follows a classic huckster pitch to the letter.",1347980292

It also means they are not supported by corporate interests either, so won't scew programmes to avoid upsetting advertisers.<p>Whether or not they really are impartial is largely a matter of opinion, but I would personally say that they are at least less biased that other channels.",1347979782

How can they say that there was no tampering when everyone admits the ""record keeping wasn't very good""?<p>They cannot produce research records from 10 to 12 years ago? Why not? Why would they throw such stuff out? Wouldn't they present all their research data when they submit to peer review? If not, why not?<p>Your articles mentioned that they did in fact hide their data, deleted emails to prevent going public. Why? If you look around you can find articles where they not only did not present their data for review, they actively prevented people they didn't like from getting access to it. Even after publishing in scientific journals. That's not good science.<p>Of course they should have been more public with their data, that's the whole point. But saying that, well, those guys over there were bad about it is not an excuse for them to use to refuse to present their data.<p>So, we can all agree that the findings are suspect because the data appears to be lost and/or incomplete.

1. The human mind can only maintain sustained focus at the highest levels for a limited amount of time each day, which is why in a typical work day, performance drops significantly after 3PM.<p>2. When tired or exhausted, your mind will default to system 1 thinking (using Nobel winner Kahneman's description for fast, intuitive, emotional and automatic decision-making process because it requires less energy; from his book Thinking Fast, and Slow) which is normally bad for start-ups that require intense focus and deep insight.<p>Accept that the human mind works very well in matters requiring problem solving skills and creative deliberation for 4-5 hours, the other 4-5 hours leave for less intense duties (responding to routine email, basic accounting, staff meetings, exercise, playing with the kids, etc.). To push your mental focus so hard will render you a complete zombie by nighttime and your significant other will leave you, make no doubt about it, because it would be like talking to a wall that just nods and blinks.

It doesn't seem to support your position.<p>I'm also rather disappointed to see the stereotype ""we hate everything"" characterisation of Slashdot from a couple of posters here. That's like saying HN is just full of college kids who think making a social web app with geolocation and a REST API is going to turn them into gazillionaires when they pivot to something useful (after all, the idea doesn't matter, it's the people who count) and then get acquired by Facebook for the GDP of a small country.<p>Obviously there really are quite a few young, delusional people on HN, but I don't think most of us spend time here because of those people. Obviously there really are quite a few very negative/selfish people on Slashdot, but I don't think most of us who spend time there do it because of those people, either.<p>Incidentally, as I write this, Slashdot's home page is full of topics that might have been (and in several cases have been) popular on HN as well: several articles on new technologies, several popular science articles, commentary on issues like piracy and privacy, and so on. There are some decent comments in the related discussions, too.<p>That all said, I don't go to Slashdot as much as I used to. Partly that's because they keep messing around with (and often breaking) the basic design and functionality of the site. Partly it's because a lot of the stories are old news by the time they get past the editors, and they've already hit the front pages of HN, relevant subreddits, etc. Partly it's because the discussions are too big for a simple chronological ordering to really work and the system for filtering by moderation score doesn't seem to help much. All of these things make the site more frustrating than it used to be, and I suspect if Slashdot is indeed on the way out there will be plenty of places to point fingers.<p>But please can we not descend to the level of ""Oh, those people on {other site} are just {arbitrary negative stereotype}"".

There were two ways to wire each sensor, and one of them was wrong.  Someone had methodically installed every single sensor backwards.  Murphy quipped something -- no one is exactly sure what it was -- which was cited in the <i>Aviation Mechanics Bulletin</i> as ""Murphy's Law: if an aircraft part can be installed incorrectly, someone will install it that way.""  A few mutations later and this became the famous ""Murphy's Law"".<p>I think the original Murphy's law applies with great force to the world of programming languages.  If there are multiple ways of doing something, and some of them are stupid, you still have to know <i>all</i> of those stupid methods because some idiot on your team will do it.  The probability of this happening increases as the size of your team increases.<p>The proper course of action as a language designer is to make sure that foolish methods are not built into your language.  What you do <i>not</i> do is design foolish methods into your programming language, and then put up a big sign on Hacker News saying ""don't do that"".<p>The Original Murphy's Law is so critical to the design of systems -- languages, APIs, libraries, etc., that after your post I feel compelled to ask you to put down your Programmer's Card and step away from the keyboard at this time.",1347978576

The market of high school aged soccer players in the United States looking for their ideal college program is immense. The best of the best however are known to many of the top coaches nationwide, but what about the majority? the good players, who are serious about finding a 4 year program to play at which will also meet their academic needs? The number of these players is immense, and only getting bigger each year, boys and girls. Trust me, as someone that can remember being a sophopmore, or junior in high school and traveling the country playing in so many different tournaments to be noticed by a small amount of coaches, I always wondered why there didn't exist some sort of software which would create profiles for individual players based on their club teams, which would contain specific academic information, and athletic information as well. Perhaps a video introduction and some other attributes too. Coaches, and school programs would have their own profiles as well containing valuable information about the school, team, facilities, location, job placement upon graduation, size of team, reputation of the coach etc. The software would offer suggestions of programs to the players and also offer coaches suggestions of players based on the previously mentioned attributes. I think the whole process of coaches courting players, and players looking for schools could be streamlined, and made far smoother than it currently is. I'm looking for someone to help develop this with me, if you played college soccer it'd be an awesome bonus but if not, that's cool too.<p>feel free to contact me with thoughts, ideas, feelings, and opinions<p>All the best!",1347978154

The constant influence drives creativity, spontaneous idea generation, acquisitions, pr, hr, etc.  Also, acceptable weather.<p>Seattle's tech scene is 90% Amazon employees.  You have other smaller companies and startups out there, but Amazon dominates. To start a company, you'll be fighting Amazon for employees.  If you hire an ex-Amazon employee, you have to spend six months deprogramming them from broken Amazon processes and lifestyles.  Bonus for Seattle: no personal or corporate income tax (just a 9.5% sales tax).<p>NY's tech scene is almost hidden.  You won't run into it day to day.  You'll run into actors, models, fashion designers, lawyers, quants, tourists, and people trying to find their place in the world.  You won't hear someone talking about json or rails or functional programing in coffee shops or on the subway.<p>Summary conclusion: If you're a high strung aspie nerd who wants to win win win -- SF or The Bay Area.  If you don't need tons of employees or can import employees from around the country, Seattle beats SF to avoid taxhell and dirtyhell and smellyhell and homelesshell.  If you want to date, have a life, have culture, and cross pollinate your company with The Real World, NY wins.<p>Transit conclusion: In The Bay Area or Seattle, you'll want to have a car.  If you never leave SF, you can get by without a car.  In NYC, only crazy people have cars (just wait until you can afford a door-to-office helicopter).<p>Place-to-live conclusion: SF's housing/rental market is broken.  Seattle has more sane rents and places to live, but nothing is connected by transit.  NY has adjustable rent depending how far out you want to live, and everything connected by transit.<p>Starting a company conclusion: Seattle wins because of no income tax, still having a relatively high techie population, and young we-can-do-this atmosphere.  California rips almost 10% out of your paycheck for personal taxes and more with corporate taxes, but you're surrounded by the best startup people in the world.  NY has a more sane personal income tax level around 6%, but you'll be importing startup people or herding them yourself (just convince some actors to act as programmers until they can actually program).<p>Actual conclusion: If you want the easy build-to-flip or fail-by-acquihire approach, be in SF.  If you want to be around good people and not be taken advantage of by your local governments, use Seattle to start/grow your company.  If your company deals with real people having real problems and you want to live an adventure, use New York City.<p>Am I qualified to have these opinions?  Check my profile.",1347977895

By having custom syntax for ""method that takes a single block"" you get a certain simplicity that makes methods look like built-in keywords:<p><pre><code>    loop { puts ""Nuts"" }
</code></pre>
It does make multi-block methods look ugly, but frankly, I think they look ugly in any language.<p>Lisp has macros (which has both it's advantages and disadvantages), but I find that Ruby's blocks make the lack of macros more tolerable.<p>Compared to JavaScript/Perl/Python-lambas, Ruby's blocks don't introduce another scope. ""self"" and ""return"" still refer to the method's scope (I'm not sure what this type of scope is called; it's not the variable scope I'm talking about here). By introducing another set of keywords that work on the block (""next"" and ""break"") you can easily wrap code in blocks without changing the semantics.

An FPGA would control and modulate the LED's (at the time it was the only affordable thing that could modulate a LED 400.000 times a second) The whole thing was online via an OEM phone module and would automatically update with ads, weather, etc. from a server where customers could buy campaigns online. Campaigns could of course be customised wo that you could get your ad only on the displays you wanted. I was in charge of getting this whole bandoogle from an idea to a product, and while it was hard I managed develop and bring it to market for around $200.000.

Three of Israel's largest banksthe Union Bank of Israel, the Israel Discount Bank, and Barclays Discount Bankhad loans of some $660 million outstanding to diamond dealers, which constituted a significant portion of the bank debt in Israel. To be sure, not all of these loans were in jeopardy; but, according to bank estimates, defaults in diamond accounts rose to 20 percent of their loan portfolios. The crisis had to be resolved either by selling the diamonds that had been put up as collateral, which might precipitate a worldwide selling panic, or by some sort of outside assistance from the Israeli government or De Beers or both. The negotiations provided only stopgap assistance: De Beers would buy back a small proportion of the diamonds, and the Israeli government would not force the banks to conform to banking regulations that would result in the liquidation of the stockpile.""</i><p>from the article about trying to sell diamonds - <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you...</a>",1347977075

Freedom of information laws vary by State, but in general, employees of State Universities are State employees, and as such information related to their positions, etc may be subject to a freedom of information request. I'm not intimately familiar with the FOI laws in Virginia, but I do know that they require salaries of all State University employees be divulged under a FOI request (you can get that information here: <a href=""http://datacenter.timesdispatch.com/databases/salaries-virginia-state-employees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://datacenter.timesdispatch.com/databases/salaries-virgi...</a> or any other number of places)<p>It is not at all unprecedented to ask for emails of State employees in a freedom of information request, though the scope must be pretty narrow to be successful. You may see, for example, requests being made for emails related to deliberations around specific procurements.<p>Personally, I think a blanket off limits approach to university personel is a slippery slope. People biased enough to be upset over a request like this should feel free to submit similar requests to researchers (at State institutions) whose results they disagree with.<p>One more point - no FOI request would ever have a chance of being approved asking for something like 'all emails from an email account' - these requests need to be very narrow and specific to be granted so it would likely be something more like 'emails related to one specific research topic in a specific timeframe'. So, folks who think they're looking for a broad selection of personal emails to find something personally embarrassing are off base.",1347976971

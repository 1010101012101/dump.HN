8446210,comment,8444272,8446020,0,0,clarecorthell,,,"Of people who use these tools, only a very small percentage of them also build said tools. Which makes sense. In industry, companies want to build meaningful products and data sets that provide value which can be exchanged for money. That means delivering some majority of the value in the shortest amount of time possible. For that reason, engineering teams have little room for R&D, including the kind you&#x27;re hinting at. Scikit, for example, has largely academic contributors (<a href=""http://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html</a>). Not surprising. Talents of pedantry, proof-writing, and pushing the boundaries of theory probably lies in academia as opposed to industry. Industry rewards shipping code (useful oversimplification) and academia rewards novel theory (yet another oversimplification).<p>Solving problems requires understanding what solutions exist (and whether they can be used, must be built upon, could be used in ensemble, etc). Choosing among those solutions requires understanding (to some varying degree) why and how the solution solves the problem. Choosing the correct out-of-the-box solution is not trivial.<p>One very real danger here is unwittingly lying with statistics. Which is arguably worse than wittingly doing so.",1413140193

He&#x27;s a singer. He was castigated for his association with Communists, subpoenaed to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, and found guilty of contempt of Congress before an appeals court overturned it.<p>Is singing a sensitive position?

Having a strongly held belief which happens to be aligned with a foreign power&#x27;s stated goals does not immediately make one a security risk.<p>Consider that in South Africa during Apartheid, and after abandoning the Native Republic policy in 1948, the South African Communist Party was one of the few that called for the end of Apartheid and equality of the races. The Suppression of Communism Act in 1950 formally banned the party and all those who supported communists. In practice then, that power was used to prosecute anyone against apartheid, since after all their aims were aligned with the presumed aims of communism.<p>Mandela was a member of the SACP and served on its Central Committee.

That&#x27;s one of the critical points. Domestic law can be skirted by International Law and International Law can be skirted by Domestic Law.<p>Need an American&#x27;s data? We can&#x27;t take it off the wire, store it, process it, and inspect it (in all cases). But Canada can, or Israel can, or Australia can, or New Zealand can (etc).<p>Need a foreigner&#x27;s data that blocked by espionage laws? The country may itself be able to. Or a partner that doesn&#x27;t have an agreement may be able to.<p>> PRISM: Initial reporting said that the NSA had direct access... NSA did not have access to any of their servers<p>Right, but this is one of those word games. First, the direct access the NSA DID have was not under the PRISM program. Reading &quot;PRISM program did not give NSA direct access to servers&quot; reads the same as &quot;NSA has no direct access to servers&quot; but it&#x27;s not.<p>The &#x27;targetted&#x27; collection of data itself turned out not to be very &#x27;targetted&#x27; at all. Many requests were for large swaths of data and in many cases the NSA was given direct control of the servers that stored the metadata (as with phone records) but would need to request the companies for the content itself. Metadata = surveillance.<p>To extend the skirting laws above, the federal government is able to bypass laws on search and seizure by forcing private enterprises to do it and then requesting it as they see fit later on.<p>Why are these companies allowed to surveil and have access to my information? I don&#x27;t trust employees at Google or Apple any more than a stranger on the street or any random government employee. Actually, as there are few to nil restrictions on what corporations can do with databases of my and other communications, in some sense it&#x27;s worse. Aren&#x27;t we guaranteed security in our persons and our affects? If a federal government forces a private company to censor you, or to surveil you, isn&#x27;t that still censorship or surveillance - regardless of whether as feds they act on, collect, mine or process that information/data at all?<p>> XKeyscore ... no proof shown by Greenwald or indicated in his slides he published that it had been used to collect American&#x27;s communications<p>But it did show that there were mammoth amounts of American metadata present in the database (however it was collected). Doesn&#x27;t seem to matter whether XKeyScore was the collector or just a repository.<p>> The Stewart Baker article... porn<p>There is a lot that the NSA and CIA can do to influence people, their credibility and the credibility of an idea in groups (MINERVA, etc) - look at what the USAID Cuban Twitter program nearly succeeded in doing, and what similar efforts may have had a role playing in Hong Kong (and dare I say Scotland).<p>There is no doubt about the use of using Porn to discredit &#x27;radicalizers&#x27; (a term used to refer to foreign and domestic targets).

Prior to that I was mostly writing applications that generated SQL and wrapped the results in some HTML.  Pretty boring.  Data science is more compelling.<p>Over the past 15-20 years there has been a massive amount of information piling up in databases and log files; not just from web applications but from desktop and mobile apps too.  And there are companies who want to pan for gold in that data.    So if you want to do something more interesting than fiddle with canvases, or CSS or MVC frameworks, then data science is fairly accessible if you&#x27;re not afraid of math.  Furthermore, most companies will have a need for it even if you don&#x27;t really care to develop their software products directly.<p>NB: I doubled my salary by moving into data science.  Nowadays gas station attendants can write a Rails app to search a database. The bar has been lowered.

8446026,comment,8444739,8444739,0,0,mmastrac,,,"HTTP/2 is certainly not a clean separation of concerns like HTTP/1.x was, but it&#x27;s something of a pragmatic approach to protocol design.<p>HTTP/1.x was neatly layered on TCP with an easy-to-parse text format. This in turn ran neatly on IP4/6, which ran on top of Ethernet and other myriad things. This separation of concerns gave us the benefit of being very easy to understand and implement, while also allowing people to subvert the system, adding things like half-baked transparent proxies to networks that would munge streams and couldn&#x27;t agree where HTTP headers started. We ended up having to design WebSockets to XOR packets just to fix other people&#x27;s broken deployments.<p>HTTP/1.x also became so pervasive that it became the overwhelmingly most popular protocol on top of TCP, even to the point where a system administrator could block everything but ports 80 and 443 and probably not hear anything back from their userbase. This is the reason we ended up with earlier monstrosities like SOAP and XML-RPC: by that point HTTP had become the most prevalent transport that it was assumed incorrectly in many cases that it was the <i>only</i> transport.<p>Perhaps the IETF should be pushing a parallel version of HTTP that pushes many of these concerns into SCTP. The problem here is that it&#x27;ll take forever to get that rolled out and we need something to improve things now. Look at how long it&#x27;s taking to roll out IPv6: something we <i>actually need</i> to fix now.",1413136943

The NSA currently requires companies (like Microsoft, Apple) to provide encryption keys corresponding to devices where pertinent. If you look at Bush era legislation most of the pen register, tap-and-trace laws and rulings were precisely pulling existing laws for telecommunication onto the domain of the internet by arguing technical equivalence. It is also true today that essentially all telecommunications are done over digital lines.<p>Finally Apple isn&#x27;t a &quot;web company&quot;, nor is Microsoft or the majority of &#x27;large corporations&#x27;.<p>> &quot;...unless the encryption was provided by the carrier and the carrier possesses the information necessary to decrypt the communication&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think I need to say very much here.<p>Regarding Apple&#x27;s encryption there&#x27;s lots of good information about how very little it actually does and can do.

RSA is now in a similar boat.<p>&quot;Weaken encryption&quot; does not mean &#x27;lower the bit security under the standard attacker model&#x27; here. In this case it means &#x27;subvert encryption through design or implementation flaws, key repositories, controlled PRNGs, side channel access or designed-in systems level access to the data&#x27;. &quot;Weaken encryption&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;choose smaller key sizes&quot;, it means &quot;make the fact that something is encrypted a weak guarantee of security and privacy.&quot;<p>> But the Silicon Valley companies that we know and more-or-less love have done the opposite<p>Image management, nothing more. Why the public showdown? That doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all. No sir, I&#x27;m certain that corporations would like to provide security and privacy for their customers. And they do.

There is no David and Goliath story here, no heroes to be heralded. It&#x27;s romantic, alright. I wish it were realistic.<p>Google (and others, that we are supposed to love) fought several battles that made it to the highest levels of court in the United States but lost. They were then forced to comply. The United States used extreme financial leverage to get QWest to comply (and when they still wouldn&#x27;t, let/forced them to go bankrupt).<p>What&#x27;s changed since then?

Next, carriers might compete on price for their flat rates. At some point, connections charges might become a non-issue.",1203986661

You are right, its place is where what you want to consume and what you (want to) produce are different goods. I don't see why the web would change that basic principle. You may contribute your expertise to Hacker News, an open source project and a couple of Wikipedia pages. But surely you don't want to consume only your own products. But maybe the producers of your desired ""goods"" (whether purely informational bits and bytes or real physical apples or oranges) derive no direct benefit from your aforementioned products. You will necessarily arrive at some medium, whether you call it credits or miles or dollars.",1203985807

It might have been having a better product that helped them at first, but right now the single most important factor keeping people coming back to Google is: habit.<p>Everyone is used to going to Google to search.

It takes breaking the habit of reaching for Google whenever I need to search.<p>It takes more than a slightly better product for folks to break this kind of habit. It's the same reason why Google has trouble competing with established search engines in other countries, even if Google has better results.<p>When Google came out it was a LOT better than everyone else, so people switched.

It's also possible to stretch the parental leave into a longer time of subsidized part-time. One of my bosses is doing that right now.<p>However, the system is designed for salaried employees. If you're self-employed, your parental leave benefits are based on whatever bills your customers chose to pay in the 12 months before birth (but hearsay).",1367477898
5643026,comment,5642705,5642902,1,0,craigyk,,,"I'm not sure exactly.  Is the pay at 100%?  In California you might be paying already into the state disability program, in which case you are automatically entitled to six weeks of leave at ~50% pay... if your employer is awesome they might cover the rest (so Yahoo might be covering ~70% of the total cost rather than 100%).  As so why it is economically desirable: making/raising kids is a HUGE investment in time and money, but without children and involved parents you're looking at disaster 15-20 years down the line.  It's desirable/viable in the same way that buying gas is desirable/viable to making your car run.",1367477894

Long parental leave works in bigger organizations, because there tends to be people who can fill in, but for smaller ones less so. Countries without parental leave in effect force every couple to delay having children, quit their jobs or spend very little time with their little ones, all in favor of startups.

I appreciated your help, but you were clearly too quick to declare your own success and my lack of motivation or effort. You provided two phone numbers, one of which I had already tried, and both of which were dead ends. That was the only issue you expressed interest in talking to me about, so that is the only thing I mentioned in my reply, so I didn't waste your time or mine.<p>I am traveling up to Napa very soon, and was considering trying to drop by their office, but politely and without presumption. However, it is not my dream to work with Ev and Biz. I just have the impression they share my goals and values, so would potentially be great people to partner with. I will continue to be on the lookout for opportunities to connect with them, but it's not my only option.<p>What I AM doing is moving forward on the MVP of my product, with my partner who has committed to a substantial amount of effort to building the business. I am feeling great about our prospects, as he has brought more to the team than I had even hoped for. He is very confident we can handle the big data (as he has already done major projects using Cassandra). And since he is willing to contribute more than I expected, and we work together even better than I hoped, things are looking up.<p>I have endured far more for far longer in pursuit of this goal than Barnes' blind baggage ride. In the last year alone I have endured several trials that would have broken many men (no exaggeration). I (and my family) have come out the other side stronger than ever, and I am determined to do everything in my power to pursue this goal. This year, next year, 10 years, this is what I will be doing, because I would do it even if I didn't need any money.

I also bought Minecraft some time ago (back when it was roughly €7).<p>Having used Minecraft for a pretty long time, I don't feel like it's the sort of thing someone should hold up as exemplary of how fast Java is / can be.  Instead, for me at least, it's more evidence of Java apps having troubles making use of available system resources (particularly many cores and/or larger amounts of RAM) as well as demonstrating that portability still can be a problem with Java apps (as in OpenGL v OpenGL ES; MCPC v. MCPE, MCPI & MC360; and even windows v Linux & Mac).<p>I get that it is possible to write Java such that certain things run pretty fast.  I also don't think that these sorts of metrics should be used as the only metric every developer uses to decide what language to use for their projects.  Therefore, I don't feel that these are reasons to conclude that someone else should or shouldn't use java for their project (as surely they have their own priorities which they base their own decisions on).<p>On the other-hand I don't think that any software programming language having advanced features which allow for efficient use of these various other system resources matters much, if many (most?, most popular?, many popular?) projects don't use them (or perhaps don't use them correctly).  For that matter the same goes with hardware... it hardly matters if some chip has amazing super powers, if few projects use them.<p>Back to why people think Java app can be slower than they ought to be.  My experience has been that when Java first began to become popular, it became the language of choice in many universities. Not long after that it was common to find poorly designed & implemented projects to be written in Java.  While this has changed by now, nearly all of the Java projects, that I have experience with don't have an obvious priority of maximising performance by using all available system resources as efficiently as they can be.",1367476774

It is no longer accelerating along a physical axis but instead along a virtual one. What Peter Thiel doesn't see is that the virtual curve will be even more transformative than the physical one. Physical technology has had hundreds of thousands of years to evolve but virtual technology will obsolete it in just a few decades. How? The answer starts out looking a little like Angry Birds but probably ends up more like the Holodeck.<p>The issue of measurement IS important. The problem with all of Peter Thiel's metrics is that they are inherently indicators of external activity. The triumph of the virtual curve reveals itself in the only metric that really matters: time.<p>All forms of technology have the same purpose: to optimize the utility obtained during a finite lifespan. Some forms of technology increase the utility per unit time, others simply increase the units of time we have left. Therefore, more and more time spent in virtual space is an indication that virtual technology is out competing the substitutes provided by physical technology. As we go higher up the virtual curve and technology becomes more advanced at fulfilling our emotional and psychological needs by moving bits instead of atoms, eventually physical progress will slow to baseline: literally life support (maybe with gamified life extension projects taking place in virtual land).<p>Alas, the last technology invented by man will not be the singularity, it will be near perfect virtual reality; closer to Angry Birds than Skynet.",1367476580

It's been 5 years now and the Indian IT industry isn't dead yet. It would have been a great bet at that point in time to have gone long on the Indian IT companies. 2010 boom for the Indian IT industry was short lived. The valuations for Indian IT co's hit their peak around that time. Was it sustainable? It was time to go short on the Indian IT co's. It's 2013 now and barring TCS, the rest of the folks have retreated. All their strategies at differentiating haven't fetched them much.<p>I can point out all of this with the advantage of hindsight. Although I pointed out when I commented on your Forbes article, I would still reckon that it's not a fare game. So here's my take about the future of Indian IT:<p>On Margins:\nInfosys has for long resisted competing on margins, and quite arrogantly so. It has now lost out to other players. 31% are idling on ""Bench"" as of today. The future is- its going to join the fray and begin to scale the labor arbitrage heights too. Although a lot depends on demand & supply, about 2 to 3 years down the line, we will start to witness a margin squeeze for all the IT co's.<p>Will the Indian IT co's get to the forefront of technology and technology driven services?:\nNo and no. Not in the next 5 to 7 years. Simply because it's not in their DNA. Although I fancy Bruce Henderson's school of thought and like to think that Indian IT co's should start acquiring smaller American tech companies and start moving up the value chain in their service offerings, start building Cusumano's Hybrid Models etc... At heart, I believe in Henry Mintzberg's school. Indian IT co's will remain at the mid and trailing edge just managing to stay off of the cliff. That's the terrain they know and are comfortable with. That's where they have come to be and will be.",1367475357

There is no such thing as a point mass in reality). So the energy conversion from speed to distance and back is not 100% efficient and an asteroid (or the Earth, for that matter) is doomed to eventually fall into the sun or fly away from it forever. It cannot keep circling forever, even in a theoretically perfect situation.<p>In addition to that, the tidal forces will compress and decompress the mass of both objects, which effectively converts potential energy (the distance between the two objectds) into heat. Even though the moon is on a trajectory to eventually leave earth orbit, every tide that comes in and leaves lowers the rotation speed of the moon. While the moon has no liquids on it's surface, which makes the effect nearly invisible, it does have tides (slight variations in the angle and magnitude of gravity at it's surface) which move objects around and the energy for that does indeed come from orbital decay.

Often that's a factor in whether I keep them running.<p>EDIT: I was assuming when you said ""...keeps it simple with the icons..."" that you were referring to the Dock.",1367474732

As an Aussie trying to impress American employers (in the past) with my credentials, this goes some way to explaining why they list ""GPA 4.0"" as required.

Costco in the other hand targets the upper-middle-class.<p>Poor families do not have the space neither the stable income required to shop wholesale.

32700,comment,32668,32693,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I'll be surprised if Google lasts as long as Microsoft. They sure as hell won't last as long as WalMart. Not a chance.<p>As has been pointed out, MSFT could destroy half the revenue of google tomorrow by adding an ad blocker to IE. It's probably their long term goal (they do have a long term, you know) to take that revenue, and so they don't bother.<p>As for CostCo, they simply don't have any choice but to do the best for their shareholders, and that can mean a lot of different things, from apeing WalMart to contrasting with it.  17 dollars an hour (or whatever) for retail workers strikes me as ridiculous, but they may well have a good reason for it. Mom-and-pop shops usually pay minimum, WalMart a few bucks over minimum, while Costco pays more than factory wages. Maybe wages fall under their marketing budget...",1183691280

Perhaps the reason they don't stop after the windfall is because they're working for themselves and doing what they love? Freedom is the ability to choose what you do, it doesn't mean not working.<p>I'm not even sure it's accurate to say that ""most"" don't stop. I personally know some very driven people who have ""retired"". They're doing things now they feel are more fulfilling or more interesting.

This is a picture posted in another HN thread of their &quot;original sensor&quot; which is just 2 basic IR sensors: <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots.angel.co/73/340163/7982c9ae0ff6493c904eb57c3e53cab9-original.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots.angel.co/73/340163/7982...</a><p>As far as I can tell from the updated website, the new sensor is the same thing, just dressed up nicer. Each sensor is only counting one metric, i.e. ingress. Beyond that, the base hardware (not the sensor) is a Raspberry Pi that connects to both the sensor(s) and WiFi. I&#x27;d imagine it would make sense to have many sensors for each box, but maybe not.",1436813983

At one of my consults all the developers lean heavily on IDE debugging at the expense of developing well-defined contracts and interfaces. Nobody blinks twice at having a ton of threads mutating global variables because they have all these great debugging and tracing tools.",1436813980
9880235,comment,9878597,9880169,0,0,dfine,,,"Great questions.<p>1) the processing is happening aboard the sensor, counts are what are sent back to the servers<p>2) we don&#x27;t do unique identification like that. We use object detection, which is different than using unique biometric markers like face detection. That means that we can track a person or a car within a frame of view, but not if they exit and re-enter the frame like in the case you described.<p>Does Density still use wifi pinging for part of its counts?",1436813973

9880232,comment,9878482,9880121,0,0,geofft,,,"Thanks, I definitely understand this topic imperfectly -- I am familiar with high-performance serialization, but I&#x27;m not familiar with Java or best practices with doing this sort of thing in Java. So it&#x27;s definitely helpful for you to be clear in what you&#x27;re discussing and what Unsafe is currently used for.<p>Is the specific Unsafe use here to serialize a Java object into a byte array? The linked article doesn&#x27;t describe using Unsafe, so I&#x27;m still not sure what functions are at issue.<p>This is what I was referring to about a bounds-checked buffer in my parent comment: it seems like you could state that accesses to an area of memory are unsafe and unchecked, except to check that the reads/writes are within the buffer. This preserves safety for the JVM as a whole, but gets you native performance within the buffer. Intel MPX should be able to implement this efficiently, and the standard techniques in other languages for efficient bounds-checked memory access should all apply.<p>Am I completely off-base here?",1436813955

Both have been beaten on for so long that they&#x27;re both fairly reliable, which is not to say either bug free (reliable or secure), resource efficient or maximally productive, just more usable in production on average.<p>On the client side (browser-land), JavaScript (and HTML & CSS) is ubiquitous.  The issue of course is that every browser is &quot;especially&quot; different.  So it makes no sense to deploy browser extensions unless things need to talk to other local apps.   It makes more sense to develop hybrid native apps which are mostly html5 using something like QtWebKit and add your own per-platform goop rather than try to use something like node-webkit, phonegap (cordova) or appcelerator, because, inevitably, system-specific code will be needed, and not having direct access to APIs because of limited proxy/thunk/trampoline code doesn&#x27;t make for happy developers.  Java tried to do the hybrid way using JNI, which could load dll&#x27;s, dylib&#x27;s and so&#x27;s dynamically (I wrote a custom, cross-platform (Linux, Windows), CD-ROM-based app installer using Java + JNI in 1995 by the way, it was trivial..

It&#x27;s not what it once was, but there&#x27;s still a lot going on.<p>Seems that there are a lot of stakeholders who are care a lot more about not having Greece default than was the case for Detroit, while at the same time nobody has enough power to really make anybody do anything. So Greece is coming down to a very long and drawn-out series of negotiations where nobody can put their foot down and say, look, here are the lines you can&#x27;t cross, and here&#x27;s where you&#x27;re allowed some flexibility. Figure it out.<p>With Detroit, it all happened in an environment with a strong legal system that could keep the various parties under control.

Maybe Hubert Dreyfus is correct and there can&#x27;t be general AI, but the fact of the matter is that our actor-networks (as in Latour) are already crowded with algorithms and machines. What does it mean for a machine to be accountable, dependable, reliable, and yes, fair?<p>An image classifier should be invertible -- if we&#x27;re consistently getting that black men look like apes, we should know what the machine thinks an ultra-archetype ape is. Interestingly, this has been the focus of a lot of research since I took that NN class in college back in 2001 -- we&#x27;re able to visualize hidden layers now.<p>A credit scorer should be consistent with some wider sense of credit worthiness, sure. It should be possible to increment your credit score, at the margin, with marginal changes to (real, important) inputs, rather than have it place you in a brittle &quot;unreliable&quot; type.

We know that the Facebook studies on nudging voting behavior and emotions had ties to these programs as well.<p>We know that threat intelligence systems include patterns to block certain URLs and content that is foreign controlled propaganda - notably of Russian origin and that there are people in the government full time on tracking Salafist ideas online for both blocking when they reach American audiences and engagement of various sorts overseas.<p>We know that there is a firewall between the State Department and DoD when it comes to the programs (State Department has the overt programs for the most part and the DoD the covert). We know a few things from various leaks about partnerships (HB Gary Federal, etc) with private sector intelligence firms.<p>We also have reports from the US and journalists about some of the techniques of adversary nations and we have some details especially about GCHQs JTRIG capabilities and some of the areas the NSA and GCHQ have worked in due to Snowden document. We have a couple of other examples - things like ZunZuneo - that some social media platforms are fronts for various countries rather than merely partners.<p>We also know some things about the law in the United States for messaging: foreign messaging the US has pretty much no limitations. While it will censor American political speech (al-Alwaki&#x27;s youtube videos, etc) for the most part it can justify minimal amounts of this and focuses on foreign speech and foreign aimed influence.<p>It is legal in the United States to message Americans under wartime powers, states of emergency (Occupy and Ferguson were both considered states of emergency), and for the purposes of getting domestic support for overseas military operations. The Smith-Mundt Act was recently revised to remove the limitation on the US government to prevent foreign-aimed propaganda from being incidentally consumed by Americans (the internet makes this hard) but it&#x27;s unfortunate that this happens quite a lot (why they had to make the revision) and that it has, in the past, been purposefully abused.<p>We also know some things about historical partnerships, but most of that has to do with &#x27;old media&#x27; and it&#x27;s hard to draw real policy and technical implications from programs that existed a generation ago.

Bloodborne is the only game in the series which is actually relevant to this thread.<p>As for the class/character system, Bloodborne is actually not a Souls game and is deliberately different. I don&#x27;t really want to get into a big discussion of the game mechanics here, but it took what worked best from Demon&#x27;s Souls and invested everything in it. Nobody really played with heavy armor in Demon&#x27;s Souls anyway except perhaps for a self-imposed handicap. Bloodborne is basically a streamlined Demon&#x27;s Souls with the cruft that didn&#x27;t work well thrown out and a more explicitly Lovecraftian story and world.<p>DS2 has a lot more variety but also has a large number of basic mechanical issues, such as imprecise hitboxes.<p>Dark Souls 1 probably hits the sweet spot between variety and solid fundamentals. Hopefully Dark Souls 3 marks a return to this style.",1436812633

I used to complain all the time about XAML, and as a huge React fanboy, its been lurking in the back of my mind. Why would I like JSX but not XAML? Especially since early Silverlight projects used &#x27;code-behind&#x27;, which is essentially just a c# file that is paired with each component. How is this different than React? At all?<p>I think the biggest difference is that XAML was really terrible to work with in part because of proprietary components and the massive tooling around it. I remember I&#x27;d have to use Blend whenever I wanted to change how something looked. And then there wasn&#x27;t a great application structure that moved along with it. I pushed really hard for us to switch from code-behind to MVVM for our application architecture. It worked great, and made everything much easier, though it was really abstract and styling was difficult still. But that was my first job--maybe if I went back it would seem trivial.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this applies to XAML, but once you start thinking of React in a component architecture model (knowing JS helps too!), the declarative style makes so much sense.",1436812568

My partner, who is in a more fortunate financial situation than myself, was able to work full-time on this from the beginning with little/no pay. I needed my day job so I spent nights/weekends on this. For many many months I was doing 20-30 hrs/week at the startup on top of the day job. He was working at the startup during the day as well as nights/weekends with me so he was definitely working more than me.<p>We’ve since rented a building and hired employees. While we&#x27;re barely sustainable at this point, if I went full-time I would be making 1/3 of what I make now and I would lose all benefits. I truly LOVE my day job and have realized that I’m not passionate about working at the startup. It&#x27;s successful side tangent in an arena we both know little about. I would also have no work/life balance. I&#x27;ve also realized that I don&#x27;t work very well in business relationship dynamic that he and I have. He wants to pursue it, I no longer want day-to-day responsibility.<p>Obviously, a 50/50 split isn&#x27;t fair any longer. We renegotiated our split based on amount of time spent working on the project-which I thought was a little dubious given the amount of time, money, hundreds of hours of design/engineering work (both our names are on the patent), and the fact that it took us both to start up. Either way, I obliged now own a little less than 10%.<p>He&#x27;s now seeking outside investment and asked me to sell all/most of my shares back to him (at a VERY low valuation) because he thinks it’s unattractive to potential investors to see a large stakeholder who isn’t full-time.<p>Questions:<p>1. Does he have a legitimate concern about the large stakeholder issue? I feel like I&#x27;ve already let go of too much.<p>2. If so, what percentage would be considered &quot;small enough&quot;?

This accounts for half of your time being taken by &quot;process&quot;.<p>So small companies migth be more interesting, but also riskier (because small companies are tipically start-ups which haven&#x27;t yet confirmed the validity of their business model). Of course there are exceptions, but on average this also means you get paid less.<p>One case study for fun job is id Software at the beginning - the guys who developed Doom, the first significant 1st person shooter game.

9879814,comment,9876554,9877858,0,0,schrockn,,,"Hi I&#x27;m Nick Schrock one of the GraphQL developers at Facebook.<p>While GraphQL certainly shares some attributes with OData, we believe it is substantially different enough from Data that we aren&#x27;t simply repeating the same mistakes.<p>There are a number of differences, but two in particular are striking.<p>1) Is that the GraphQL language is built with product developers in mind. This is a subjective/qualitative judgement, but we believe that it&#x27;s just a much more elegant language, and that it is a more powerful platform for tool-building. We hope to prove this out in the coming months as both we and the community build tooling atop the language and the introspection system.
2) GraphQL is more constrained. A OData service has to support a huge number of operations that make it more of a generic querying service, rather than a highly structured way to expose application logic. We agree with you that often cover too much and without adequate performance guarantees.<p>In terms of complexity on the server side, I think this is a really legitimate question. Our answer is that although there is complexity, it is generally incurred on a much smaller set of core and tool developers. The average product developer who will just need to expose a capability via a GraphQL type and then consume it on the client will not find the system overly complex.",1436810516

I share your sentiments about our parents - they sacrificed so much so that we could have a good life here in America. My problem is that the many of things they taught us do not produce the results that we - this generation - are looking for (or perhaps more kindly, are necessary but not sufficient).<p>I want adventure in my life, an uncapped career trajectory and yes, I would like to have money. But other people might want other things too - like the writers and poets featured in the Paper Tigers article.<p>The important thing is recognizing what you really truly want and not letting other people's expectations stop you from going after those things.",1305068388

2534417,comment,2533797,2534126,10,0,tzs,,,"You can equally validly argue that this will lead to a worse, less peaceful future, because some secrecy is <i>essential</i> for governments to function.<p>For example, in order to make the right decisions when dealing with foreign affairs, a government needs accurate information from its diplomats and other agents. Already one diplomat (the US ambassador to Mexico) lost his job because he provided an honest assessment of Mexico's organized crime problem and the ineffectiveness of Mexico's attempts to deal with it in his reports back to Washington. Wikileaks leaked those reports, and that embarrassed Mexican officials. Ambassadors can't function if the host country is pissed off at them, so the Ambassador was withdrawn.<p>The major effect of these leaks is going to be for the government to become less open. Assuming Manning is indeed the source of most of these leaks, the reason he had access to all that information was because the government was trying to be more open internally. One of the findings of the 9/11 investigations was that collectively we had enough information to anticipate an stop the attack, but because the information was spread among several agencies, no one was able to put it all together and see the connections.<p>In response to that finding, the government purposefully started making information more widely available across agencies, and to more people in those agencies.<p>Surely that will be cut way back now, with much less sharing between agencies, and information only going to those who definitely need it.",1305068310

Col. David Coombs, Manning's counsel:<p>“[Manning] is held in solitary confinement. For 23 hours per day, he sits in his cell. The guards check on him every five minutes by asking him if he is okay. He is required to respond in some affirmative manner. At night, if the guards can not see him clearly, because he has a blanket over his head or he is curled up towards the wall, they will wake him in order to ensure that he is okay. He receives each of his meals in his cell. He is not allowed to have a pillow or sheets. He is not allowed to have any personal items in his cell. He is only allowed to have one book or one magazine at any given time to read. The book or magazine is taken away from him at the end of the day before he goes to sleep. He is prevented from exercising in his cell. If he attempts to do push-ups, sit-ups, or any other form of exercise he will be forced to stop. He receives one hour of exercise outside of his cell daily. The guards take him to a room and allow him to walk. He usually walks in figure eights around the room. When he goes to sleep, he is required to strip down to his underwear and surrender his clothing to the guards.”[2]<p>According to an official at the Marine brig at Quantico, Va., the nudity is in fact happening[3][4].<p>Now, I'm not saying that all the aforementioned accusations are true, but it now seems clear that the solitary confinement and forced nudity at least are happening - over several months of illegal incarceration without due trial of any kind.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/14/manning/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/14...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/03/04/morrell/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/03/04...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/03/05/manning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/03/05...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/world/05manning.html?_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/world/05manning.html?_r=1</a>",1305068232

Make sure you're equipped to answer these questions, whether via relational queries or map-reduce jobs or whatever.  Also make sure that you can turn around requests for a lot of different kinds of these queries, both scheduled and ad-hoc.  Business folks call this ""reporting"" and it isn't optional, because it's one of the business' main ways of staying grounded in reality.  Is the new marketing campaign working?  Are the demographics of our users match our predictions?  How did last week's outage affect customer retention?  The worst case scenario is when the answers to those questions are nonexistent, and the second worst case is if they're hidden in log files, but after those two the worst case scenario is if the only people who can write queries against your datastore to answer those questions are the hard-core developers who ought to be adding new features or working on infrastructure.<p>So however you store your data, make sure it isn't rocket science to write the queries that the business guys need to answer their questions.  Otherwise your rocket scientists will be wasted answering marketing questions like, ""How many iPhone users who purchased our service in February used it in both March and April?"" instead of improving your technology.<p>P.S.  I believe reporting is a major motivation behind the SQL-like languages that pop up for non-relational databases, but my experience with the problem I described was actually with a very large and complicated relational database, so SQL is no panacea.  It took us a long time to create a reporting team that was self-sufficient enough to shield our senior database developers from the flow of menial reporting work.",1305068082

(Analogous to Ctrl+C to copy highlighted text.) I am trying to find a set of guiding principles which would allow the creation of an 'optimal' hotkey layout. Does anyone know of any research work on this problem?<p>I haven't had much luck searching for ""Industrial Design"" and ""shortcut layout"", but perhaps that is nonstandard terminology.<p>The most useful reference I've found was a website which outlined the story of a programmer who remapped his keyboard from QWERTY. In that case he guesstimated a cost for each key press (eg, pointer from 'f' to 'r' is 1 unit, from 'f' to '5' is two units), calculated the frequency of each character used from a collection of sample code, and then used a genetic algorithm to find an arrangement which minimized the cost.<p>This seems like an interesting starting point but I am concerned it might give a solution which breaks some higher level principle. For instance, in SC2 there are sequences of actions which occur together frequently, maybe it has been shown that it is best for one finger to push all the necessary hotkeys in the sequence or perhaps each hotkey should be given to a different finger. Is it better for the hotkeys associated with qualitatively different targets to be physically separated on the keyboard or is key reuse ok?

Now ask the question, ""how did the entrepreneur come up with the idea?"". The thoughts any any individual has are a function of their environment (that's the abstracted version of your theory :). There are lots of people having lots of ideas all the time, many with in similar environments as the entrepreneur. The net result is that if the entrepreneur did not allow their idea to 'leak' into YC's consciousness, some other person in YC's environment would do so within a short period of time. So there is no loss to the entrepreneur of exposing the idea to YC, aside from a small chance of a small time shifting of the 'leak' (only if they really are the first person to expose that idea to YC, which is statistically unlikely).<p>Simple version: <i>even if subconscious-idea-leakage exists</i>, the likely cost is vanishingly small, as your idea is unlikely to be new to YC. If it would have been new, then withholding it only buys you time until the next bright person exposes the same idea to YC.<p>If you believed in conscious/active idea leakage the numbers would look different.

There are quite a lot of things that could go wrong with the search itself, before even addressing the individual and how they seek and learn.<p>Some people learn by reading. Some people learn by listening. Some people learn by doing. This is not a weakness or a laziness issue, this is a human behavior issue. You're not pacifying people by giving them the information they're seeking. We used to call that answering, because they asked a question. If, as posed in this scenario, the first poser provided incomplete information, and the second poster posted a question asking for clarification or more details, I really fail to see how this is laziness that needs to be pacified. That is a very negative view of someone who just wanted more details.<p>The person was seeking education, they asked a question. Negativity and arrogance on how it was so obvious and they should have just searched for it are not helping educate anyone. They have the opposite effect: next time the person may not even bother asking at all, now feeling alienated and perhaps it's best to not try to learn at all. That doesn't help anyone.

Go's strings are all utf8, so unless you're working in its ASCII subset alone, you have to manually iterate over multi-byte runes to get the unicode codepoints out. That's really not what I'd call a friendly unicode handling comparable to scripting languages, or even Java.<p>Please correct if things have changed.

Strong typing is for weak minds, and it's exactly like they say at MIT: Our current popular languages are designed to help losers lose less.<p>I will be able to point to various examples where Lisp programmers have written not only 3-5 times faster, but they wrote things other programmers thought were impossible. In this regard, I'd tell the CEO, our competitors will be spending all their time trying to figure out that it's really possible we're doing what we're doing, because they will be thinking in terms of customization at compile time or link time, not at runtime.<p>Moreover, we will be operating where the CEO is focusing on his or her specialty and not imposing his or her knuckleheaded view on technology.<p>Because Lisp is dead, I'll get better programmers for less money. I'll be able to guarantee 50 more IQ points for the same pay. And my guys will be able to spend their time typing in value not book keeping overhead and typing in type descriptions because their guys are too stupid to know when they type + numbers are involved.<p>Because no one uses Lisp, I'll have my pick of thousands of great, experienced programmers looking to work for someone with a non-zero IQ, not the ones fresh out of college with 10 programs under their belts.<p>I'll be compatible with everything because it is right now. And if someone throws me a bug, I can code around it in a few minutes. Being a niche market means we're more proprietary. People will not use Lisp to compete with us because they are lamebrains listening to the latest fashion statement from Sun or Microsoft.The open source crowd isn't even smart enough to notice C++, so they are especially nowhere in the picture.<p>Of course, no CEO will belive this because every one of them is stupid.<p>-rpg-",1305065761

Was it funded by a government trying to figure out where they needed to build roads, or an advertising industry promoting itself? Do the methods support the conclusions? How much does it support the claim we're discussing?<p><i>The best way to produce a true ""proof"" would be to ignore everything that's been written and perform a sociological experiment. That would require years of work, expertise in conducting similar experiments, and millions in funding. Is that what you are asking me to do?</i><p>There have, in fact, been many millions (likely billions) spent funding sociological and urban planning studies over the years.<p>Can you reference some serious study that even halfway supports the claim? I'll read whatever you come up with with an open mind.<p>Or are you expecting me to throw out my own experience and intuition and just ""learn to accept"" yours?<p>Because my experience says that where people work and live is a major life decision that people plan for and think about very carefully. People buy houses in the suburbs because they prefer not to hear the neighbors through their apartment walls or live in the shadow of the factory or office building where they work. People buy cars because they need to get to work and cars provide convenient, comfortable, and relatively inexpensive personal transportation.<p>My intuition tells me this explanation is sufficient and we needn't invoke Bayes, Bernays, Freud, or powerful psycho-sexual subconscious forces to explain it further. Heck, my intuition would sooner accept a purely Jungian explanation than this self-important Media Studies concoction.<p>A person in advertising once related to me that the studies they went by placed sex <i>third</i> in male attention-getting effectiveness. Food came in second after...wait for it...transportation.  That's right, advertisers use transportation <i>on its own</i> to sell other products. They hardly needed to use sex to sell farmers a Model T or family cars in the 30's and 40's.<p>I <i>think</i> that my explanation will be better supported by data than yours. Here's why:<p>The automobile trend in the US started with the Model T: a utility vehicle if there ever was one. This trend was well underway far before the advertising-industrial complex really kicked into gear post-WWII.<p>Furthermore, people all over the world begin to prefer cars over walking whenever the economic/logistic factors support it.

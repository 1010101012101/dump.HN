It wasnt addressed to anyone in particular at Dragon, and it wasnt signed by anyone at Goldman. The Goldman Four testified later that they had no idea who had sent it. But the memo referred to many of the same due diligence issues that Ms. Chamberlain raised. The memo asserted, however, that Dragons accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, should do the work, not Goldman. [...] To support the argument that Goldman was not obligated to perform due diligence, the firm points to that mystery memo of Feb. 29, 2000  the memo that no one at Goldman has acknowledged sending  as establishing that Dragon Systems needed to push its accounting firm to explain any red flags or resolve outstanding worries.</i><p>Given that GS is now using this memo to cover their asses, it makes me wonder whether someone there knew what was going on...",1342353480

Thank you, yes I am clearer, the concept is even more awesome than I thought .<p>>I think active patterns do not constitute first-class patterns.<p>I agree, but like I said, they are the closest thing in active use, they extend the type of structures one can deconstruct to encapsulated ones while being more flexible in implementation. They fall in the class of techniques which extend and make matching more flexible, other examples would be multimethods and predicate dispatch. So very much orthogonal to approaches in pattern calculi but I think in a subspace in terms of matching.<p>>GADTs are also unrelated. For one, GADTs only affect the type of a constructor<p>Yes they are unrelated that's why I focused on expressitivity, and you are right, I misconstrued what you meant by generalizes on constructors. But everything has a cost - runtime, learning, cognitive overhead - what I was curious of is: how much does the pattern calculus buy you? GADTs are another concept that allow one to elegantly tackle problems where it looks like the pattern calculus would help. I was just looking for an example where something like GADTs fumbles in comparison.<p>It's clearer to me now that the pattern calculus is definitely more flexible in terms of match semantics but I can't think of any situation in practice where this would give an added advantage.<p>Also, Is this typically done via term rewriting  and is there anything on the decidability of this?",1342353161

Should the BankAccount class have a transferTo(BankAccount other) method to transfer money into another account? What if there are different account types and the exact process depends on the types of both accounts?<p>Of course it's possible to do it that way, but is it really the cleanest way to imagine this?

Pick a sub-segment of your business.  If you sell widgits, chances are some people specialize in dark green widgits from France.  Find out if there is a French Dark Green Widgit Trade Journal, and see what their rates are.  Find out if there is any specialized software which these people use, and see if you can talk to those vendors about advertising.  In my experience, unless you're doing extremely specific Ad-Words targeting, most of the usual online ""wisdom"" is completely useless when it comes to targeting small businesses (which is tragic, since they're such a huge market).<p>I'm not sure official sales people are going to work, given that they're having trouble getting initial traction.

It could be that you need polymorphism along one hierarchy but that would make the design look very unnatural in the eyes someone who knows the problem domain.<p>In my experience, OO models tend to diverge greatly from the real world over time, because after all we're not modelling the world, we're modelling a solution to a problem and we shouldn't fight the tendency for the language of the solution domain to dominate the language of the problem domain.<p>Sometimes this can mitigated by having interfaces on different levels of abstraction, but that often leads to bloated and slow systems.",1342350037

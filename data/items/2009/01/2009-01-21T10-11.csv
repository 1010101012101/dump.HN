All Souls is an odd institution, very closed to the outside, and I was never blown away by any of its fellows. From people I know who've taken the test, apparently the dinner at the end is the most crucial part, where they basically decide whether they want to socialise with you for the next six years.",1232535451

It was a free app to control a specific piece of really expensive hardware ($5k-10k whole house audio systems) so that might have made it easier.<p>What was odd is that the app doesn't do anything without the hardware, and there was nowhere to provide additional testing information, so as far as I can tell they didn't really use it.  Perhaps they just scan the binary (or source?) for bad things.",1232535165

Different dialects emerged because of regional isolation amongst different groups throughout times of historical growth.  As the world is no longer isolated from each other any more, the need to persist those independent languages has lessened to the point where distinctly different dialects (alliteration?) only hamper communication.<p>While a tool to instantly translate a conversation while two people speak would be amazing, it would have the same effect as having a universal language in my opinion.",1232534900

S o for example someone above mentions  the comms issue: a static relay planted on the surface interfacing with a seperate rover device would probably work well. In fact I would launch 2 or 3 of each type (assuming cost could be kept low) to ensure that you got at least one functioning pair :D)",1232534248

However, I am not sure what compensation should look like for these non founders.  I.e. We have been working on a project part-time for over a year, but could use another rails developer to help out on our front-end work.

I know actually it is a whole bunch of problems but I think that there is a solution which could be successful in the long-run: Educating people. Let them know what is possible and how to achieve things. Help the people, e.g. in Africa, to keep up with the world and especially also their elite which at the moment often is dominating them because they don't know better.<p>The OLPC project took a shot at this but besides creating net-books it wasn't too successful, to summarize, the OLPC project was ambitious but rubbish ;-) I don't know yet how to solve the problem of educating people ion those countries, especially when it comes to basic things like literacy and/or math but I definitely think it would be worth quite a lot of effort and also be a business opportunity because of scale (if not now maybe also in the long-run).",1232533603

443028,comment,442059,442766,0,0,cchooper,,,"Actually, she said it would cause inflation only if the central bank also successfully increases the money supply at the same time. I think Monbiot is suggesting this as an alternative to that, rather than something to occur simultaneously.<p>It's also worth pointing out that although central banks will always be able to produce the necessary liquidity, they have to take ever greater risks to do so. At the extreme, they could purchase each and every public and private bond in the economy, but then they expose themselves to the risk of default on those loans, which could result in severe future inflation. If they are unwilling to do this, then they will not be able to stop deflation. So although they <i>can</i> stop deflation, it's not clear that they will.<p>Perhaps the most unfortunate thing about Monbiot's article is that he sees alternative currencies simply as a means to fight deflation, but Lietaer saw them as a way to create social capital. The benefit of a negative interest rate mutual credit currency is that it encourages a gift economy, rather than a competitive economy, and therefore builds social ties as well as financial wealth.",1232532384

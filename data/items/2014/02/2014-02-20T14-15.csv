Even broadcast channels have been getting into the re-transmission fee game and they don&#x27;t want to give it up.  Frankly, I&#x27;m not worried that their business model is being disrupted.<p>The other issue is that ratings aren&#x27;t well tracked for streams.  This is more a problem that Nielson or someone similar needs to correct but it is a problem.  And unless/until Aeveo viewers are counted in the ratings the broadcasters get no benefit from their existence.",1392908345

There was a lot of hype about the best new testing methods with RSpec and this new thing called Cucumber, 100% paired programming all the time, 100% TDD, and 110% test coverage, fat-model, skinny-controller, decorators and service-based architectures, and on and on. These were all good things on the path to quality software as a community goal, but to a newcomer, it was overwhelming. It was the fanatical attitude and the all-too-common phrase, &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong.&quot;<p>I had already been doing Ruby for a couple years when all of this hype came to a peak. I remember pushing back over dinner table discussions with various speakers at conferences that this attitude was hurting the community. It was erecting a barrier to beginners. We were telling people they couldn&#x27;t just build something that did something. They had to do it this way, using all these tools and methodologies. Unless you know and fully understand the purpose and constraints and context for what someone is building, how can you tell them they&#x27;re doing it wrong? Where was the support for learning progressively? What happened to the joy of just building something? After all, this is where Ruby, as a language, shines!<p>I bring all this up, because I met Jim at one of the first Ruby conferences I had ever gone to around this time. Though I had been doing Ruby for a couple years, I was relatively new to the conference-going community, and so not part of the &quot;in-crowd&quot;. I remember the highlight of that conference for me was talking with Jim.<p>He seemed not to care for the existence of any sort of clique while simultaneously being its unknowing leader. He was very approachable and friendly. But more importantly, he was a great listener and thinker. I remember talking with him about my views on TDD and pair-programming (at the time, the view that &quot;it depends&quot; was controversial), and how the hype was hurting the community. He was one of the few who gave it considerable thought, and after discussing it, even encouraged me to give a talk. As someone new to the conference and public developer community, and outside the speaker in-crowd, this was very encouraging.<p>I had been asking what happened to the joy of just building something in the community at that time, but I can honestly say, Jim never lost it.<p>Jim, you&#x27;ll be missed.",1392907851

Cell tower antennas are simple dipoles, not directional antennas.<p>> Cell tower antennas are vertically polarized dipoles<p>> The fact that the vast majority of cell tower antennas are simple dipoles -- it&#x27;s the basis of the system<p>You stated three times that cell tower antennas are simple dipoles.  That&#x27;s the problem.  They&#x27;re not simple dipoles.  20 or 30 years ago they absolutely were.  Then a lot of users joined the system and the carriers all rolled out directional antennas in all but the most rural of places.<p>I&#x27;m trying to make sure that you understand that this is the point I&#x27;m arguing.<p>I fully agree that a 1/4 wave dipole is an omni.  I fully agree that pCell probably uses omnis (at least initially).  I fully agree that many years ago the cellular system used omnis.<p>Where I don&#x27;t agree is the idea that the current cellular system uses omnis.  By and large, anywhere suburban or urban, and even many rural base stations all use directional antennas.  I&#x27;ve provided tons of links showing that the carriers use directional antennas to further break up the large cells that existed when they put all the towers up (and used omnis) into smaller cells today which can support more users.<p>>  I proved my case, or weren&#x27;t you paying attention?<p>Just asserting that some statement is true doesn&#x27;t make it so.  I&#x27;ve provided plenty of evidence that carriers today use multiple directional antennas to service extra customers from their existing towers.  &quot;Directional antenna&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a 5 degree beam width, an antenna can have a 30 or 60 or 90 or 180 degree beam width and still be directional.  The towers used to be in the middle of the hexagonal cells, now they&#x27;re at the place where three hexagons meet.<p>Here is a patent by Nortel for a six-sector system in 2004.<p><a href=""http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6745051.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6745051.html</a><p>You&#x27;ll notice the familiar triangle shape holding the antennas and that there are a total of 12 antennas.<p><a href=""http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6745051-0-large.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6745051-0-large.jpg</a><p>What does that look an awful lot like?

I started my career as a developer (as planned) but changed to a user experience role when the company I was working for at the time closed its doors after half a year. I took the new role to round out my skills, and because the hiring company was a large, stable brand. All said I&#x27;ve done well in the role, and have been with the company for nearly two years now. My original manager left the job a few months ago, and is now trying to headhunt me. Herein lies my dilemma.<p>I&#x27;ve wanted to get back into development for a while and was planning on making the move during the next few months. User experience is important to me, but I miss the satisfaction of solving technical problems, getting my hands dirty, and creating things. I started keeping a side project, a roguelike game, which I work on now and then. Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t had the time to flesh it into an actual game, it&#x27;s more of a line-of-sight demo right now.<p>The headhunt offer has come with a significant promotion into management, and a generous paycheck to match. Of course accepting this will likely leave me even less time to work on side projects. I think my concern stems from the six-months-to-a-year commitment of getting a new job. I would really rather not join only to burn bridges by leaving, but if the job proves unenjoyable, six-months-to-a-year is a rather long time.<p>So here is my question, in my shoes, would you continue in an area of work that is very well paid, but you do not particularly enjoy?

The SMS component of the app wasn&#x27;t the initial focus. The company didn&#x27;t need VC funding at any point. He was able to focus on product development and revenues started to come in to cover costs.<p>2) Jan is a technical guy. He did the initial backend but hired out the iPhone development. Either way he was involved. He developed the initial app for the first 9 months or so before bringing on Ackon as a cofounder.<p>3) There is real value in the app. No one needs to question this. There&#x27;s no big pitch deck&#x27;s, presentations, etc.The app was allowed to grow organically due to its network affect. The business can scale into the millions and billions of users.<p>The $16 billion exit is largely due to number 3. It&#x27;s rare for a lot of businesses to have that kind of scale.<p>Reading the Forbes article, my takeaway is that there is no way anyone can &quot;build a path to a xx billion exit&quot;. What one can do is find a business model that can actually scale and generate real revenue. Maybe not to billion users or hundreds of millions in revenue but enough to take it outside of the &quot;lifestyle&quot; business mode. Also, having money of your own and technical skills to execute doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit.<p>I think one lesson that I would take away for the younger crowd is - slow down a bit. Go work for a big corp or even a startup that pays well. Save every penny. Instead of spending that $100 on the get together every other night save it. Build your skills. At some point, go for it. You&#x27;ll have money to live off, money to test your business model and a fallback if it doesn&#x27;t work (get another job).<p>EDIT: Another big reason for the big exit is incredible leverage by Jan. He&#x27;s got the most equity. He doesn&#x27;t need Facebook. He is already a millionaire and the App can only get better. This is deal making at its finest. I can only imagine how much back and forth happened, each time with a bigger number from Facebook.",1392905116

We&#x27;ve never seen it before, or seen it so rarely that nobody built it into the model.

But I do it explicitly with my wrist+hand, not with my arm. I never have. Always rest my hand on the paper and draw with my fingers. Then I don&#x27;t tremble, I only tremble when I gotta keep my hand still in free space. But on paper my hand&#x27;s 100% relaxed and only moves as I want it to. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve drawn things all my life and there&#x27;s a trust in my hand that allows it to relax in that way.<p>There&#x27;s two consequences to this drawing style: I draw best when it&#x27;s really small, because of the range of motion of my hand and wrist (although there&#x27;s a few ways I can use a marker and draw nice curves and cartoon faces on larger paper as well). I can&#x27;t paint :) Because if you rest your hand on the paper you&#x27;ll smear out all the paint :) This was already a problem in highschool, before I burnt out, it&#x27;s just not how I want to interact with the medium. It&#x27;s gotta be up close and personal.<p>Either way if my movements had to come out of my arm, my fingers would tremble, and it would suck.<p>BTW I have a similar fear for starting to learn electronics, I really doubt if I can handle a soldering iron and those tiny elements accurately enough to make things without it becoming a hugely frustrating exercise in &quot;accepting one&#x27;s limitations&quot;.<p>To the GP I say, try it, and really, try to relax about it (if relaxing helps with the tremors--it doesn&#x27;t for me, 100%, which is why I also need to calmly rest my hand on a surface. but then it&#x27;s pretty steady).",1392904881

I used Fedora for a few years and before that Ubuntu and I think I only ever rolled my own package or modified an existing one once or twice because of the sheer complexity of it. With Arch, from day one I was fiddling around and every time I need something that&#x27;s not packaged already (and that&#x27;s rare), it takes me minutes to do it myself. I&#x27;d much rather know how to build my way through (and not suffer) than cross my fingers that someone else already has.<p>Adding to that, I find Arch to be so clean and minimalist and more importantly unsurprising. Because of its rolling release cycle, I never have to plan an upgrade which always stressed me out with Fedora and Ubuntu.<p>Regarding hardware support, I&#x27;m running Arch on a mid 2015 manufactured Lenovo X250 and everything works out of the box and I get a solid 8 hours battery life out of it.",1449981967

They are losing money on making things harder for their users. For instance DRM means lost sales for them. Same goes for fractured releases and poor availability of what they offer. They might gain some power to tell who can get what, where and when, while in practice they reduce reach of what they make which means less profit.<p>Avoiding too much distributor&#x27;s leverage can be an issue if there is only one distributor or some collusion between them. If there is healthy competition, they can always ditch one and chose a competitor which balances this issue.

I've been a Wikipedian since about 2003, been in and out of the meta-circles, and have a mix of positive and negative opinions about how it works (but I think on the whole it's a huge benefit to accessibility of knowledge). So when something like this comes up in a community I'm also part of, I usually try to participate in the discussion. Not even really just to defend Wikipedia, because there are plenty of criticisms one could make. But it was hard to figure out where to enter into the discussion, and what productive result could come from it.<p>When there's a bunch of angry people wielding pitchforks convinced that Wikipedians (or some subset) are evil bastards who hate knowledge and love nothing but rules, it's not that conducive to calm discussion. There's just sort of a vaguely defensive, ""well, it's not <i>quite</i> like that, you know most of us also think about these issues and have tried to balance the criticisms many people have of Wikipedia, and even some of the rules and guidelines I disagree with do have some reasons they exist, but nobody seems very interested in discussing any of that, so I guess I'll just mostly sit this one out..."". To be fair, there was some good discussion buried in some of the threads.<p>I did write up a way-too-long version of what I would've said in the discussion: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability...</a><p>(As a non-HN-specific aside: What's frustrating from the perspective of someone who wants to make Wikipedia work is that it seems most external discussion of Wikipedia comes in these weird mob frenzies, but they come from opposite sides.

In Go such light-weight tasks are called goroutines.<p>Quoting from Effective Go[1]:<p>A goroutine has a simple model: it is a function executing in parallel with other goroutines in the same address space. It is lightweight, costing little more than the allocation of stack space. And the stacks start small, so they are cheap, and grow by allocating (and freeing) heap storage as required.<p>Goroutines are multiplexed onto multiple OS threads so if one should block, such as while waiting for I/O, others continue to run. Their design hides many of the complexities of thread creation and management.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#goroutines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#goroutines</a>",1298044650

PHP's docs suck. Save yourself the time and pain of learning poor functional design tips on php.net, almost any framework now will help you to separate concerns of your project. Best practices are not PHP's strong point - Have a look at almost any web designer's ""well made"" code and you'll see that PHP simply doesn't teach SoC.<p>* You usually get XSS, SQL injection and CSRF protection in a framework. nuff said.<p>* Unless database mapping is what you know and do for a living, the database abstraction layer that you build will not be as good as the ones that already exist.

2. Bandwidth - move resources to a CDN assuming you already gzip and minify text, combine javascript files, and have appropriately sized photos.
3. Disk I/O - change DB structure again, more/better caching, set up load balancers (there are tons of other optimizations to do before you get to this point)

This is the same income inclusion rate as a capital gain, but it is not considered to be a taxable gain, so you cannot use it to offset capital losses.<p>The deferral ability you mentioned (delaying tax until you sold the stock) was eliminated in the 2010 Canadian Federal budget.

We just want to make sure we take some time to understand these issues with the data feeds before we start publishing them.<p>The snow depth feed is also a really cool graph.  We have it more or less ready, but it is perhaps the least reliable measurement.<p>For example, during that recent snow storm in Chicago it reported some pretty crazy big snow depth numbers for a couple reports and then without correcting the old reports just dropped the snow depth by more than a meter in the next report.

I had always had a negative view of PHP prior to that despite knowing almost nothing about it, which I think is a not uncommon experience.<p>Anyway, there are lots of things that offend people about PHP that are basically inexcusable: like the inconsistency in parameter order (needle, haystack or the other way around?) and the inconsistent use of underscores in API method calls.<p>But all of that is just noise. Use something like PHPStorm, Netbeans, Komodo or whatever and it'll tell you the right order or if the function doesn't exist (I know some people are still in love with their raw text editors; I'm not one of them). And you learn quickly enough the right names and orders.<p>One thing I love about PHP is the simplicity of it. Edit the file, save, refresh in the browser. I love this short feedback loop. It was a refreshing change from doing Web apps in Java (for example), which added a compile/build/package step in between.<p>After doing this I investigated the common frameworks (CodeIgniter, Kohana, Zend, etc) and frankly I was horrified.<p>These things are so hideously overcomplicated. It's like a zealous Java programmer tried to recreate ""Super-Struts"" in PHP in a devilish plan to destroy all of the advantages of PHP while leaving a lot of the negatives.<p>The number of times I got bitten in the ass or just wasted time trying to figure out how the ""magic"" in Zend worked was infuriating.<p>Take something as simple as a controller. This is stupidly easy to implement yourself that any sort of generic framework is just going to bring you pointless crap you don't care about to the stuff you do by a factor of probably 10:1.<p>The ORM side was even worse. Java is kinda built for ORMs. It has stateful Web containers. PHP isn't (and doesn't).<p>The one bright spot I found was templating. It is common to say ""why use a templating language with PHP when PHP is a templating language?"" and you have an entire valid position. I too have said this.<p>That being said, I found Smarty to be incredibly useful just from the point of view of caching parts of the page and creating my own plugins/extensions for tasks that were common to me. Smarty had other issues like I wasn't completley fond of it's caching model and the speed, prior to Smarty 3 at least (which I've never used), was also questionable.<p>But despite all that I liked it a lot.<p>So can you use PHP without a framework? Sure you can. Not only that, I'd highly suggest it <i>if you know what you're doing</i>.",1298043380

Any HTML you generate is only to bootstrap your client-side application (and load initial state) and to accommodate non-JS-enabled clients, which in this date and age should only mean search engine spiders.<p>The advantage is a uniform interface, like a file-descriptor in Plan-9 (an analogy used in latest InfoQ interview with GO/Newsqueak creator), the HTTP protocol.<p>And for that, languages like OCaml or Haskell should flourish. Especially functional languages, since typical REST API request should be nothing but data+auth token (whether that's cookie or oauth token).<p>Applications developed in that model—besides being much simpler to write and test—are easily cacheable and more secure by default. The added bonus is that object oriented languages, that have been most successful in GUI programming, can be once again utilized purely for that.<p>If not embracing this model one is left with little appealing options: 1) continue to process text in perl-like manner with RoR/Django/etc., coping with nondeterministic behavior and security  2) to invest in frameworks that hide HTTP at all, coding to widgets instead of pages, and to let framework decide how to push that over the wire, which usually means that some sort of continuations are employed, which are inherently HTTP-unfriendly and uncacheable outside of the app's context 3) to replace HTTP with something else, probably some sort of RPC",1298041869

Let us assume the question to be hypothetical.<p>Our website is in beta phase and I am the only coder in the team. Looking at the idea some investors have given us a decent amount of money.<p>We launched this site through invitations to 100 people. Within a week we hit the 1000 registered users mark. Till then we had hosted our site on rackspace cloud with a server with 256MB (thats not a typo) machine. The tech stack was LAMP.<p>Sensing the growth we increased the RAM to 1 GB. The number of users at any given time was around 40. The RAM was more than sufficient for such a scenario but still the site started slowing down.<p>I immediately shifted the mysql server to a different machine. That really did not make much difference.<p>So I looked at the most frequently used operations (which was some queries with joins). I indexed all the tables accordingly and installed memcache to cache the queries for half an hour or so (wherever possible).<p>Now the number of online at any given time is increased to 120. Total registered users is 9000. 
Our investors are happy and co-founders think we are successful and now trying to buy an office for ourselves and build a proper team.<p>However I am clueless as to think how we can scale hence forth.<p>Can people give me some pointers as to the different paths I can follow?
Please note that we cant host the server ourselves, we would love to continue with rack-space.",1298041807

The one I'm most familiar with is spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) [1], which modifies the strength of a synapse based on the millisecond-level timing of action potentials. When cell A tends to fire just before cell B, and the two have synapses connecting them, then cell B will increase the strength of its synapses to A. The reverse is true too: if cell A tends to fire just after cell B, then the synapses will decrease in strength.

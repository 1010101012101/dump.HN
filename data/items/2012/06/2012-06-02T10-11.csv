We have a Mac mini hooked up to the TV for watching stuff, and after putting an SSD and bumping up the ram it flies better than when I first bought it. No reason to upgrade, everything I ask it to do it does just fine.<p>I recently bought a top-end 15"" Macbook pro for work and put 16Gb of RAM in it. Despite the positive experience with the Mac mini, I feel like I'm sometimes fighting the MBP to get what I want done. I realise that this is probably me not doing things the Mac way, but it is mildly annoying to say the least.<p>If Windows 8 is (as expected, and it was when I tested the consumer preview) similarly different, your point is absolutely spot on.<p>I'll keep the MBP mainly because of the hardware quality, but if I was buying it again I'd definitely reconsider - both against because of the differences, and for because of Windows 8 (and the touchpad).",1338634686

Of course, there are easier languages, there are more powerful languages, there are fancier languages and whatnot. I like Python and I adore Lisp. But I still love C most.<p>C is the sweet spot where I can extend my programs to do high-level stuff while still keep my hands down on the actual hardware I'm programming. I like that a lot, probably because I grew up banging hardware. Or maybe it is because I like to keep in touch with the actual device that I program: bending some definitions, <i>C is what my machine does</i>. Even if I embed Lua and script parts of my program, I'm still conceptually working on a C runtime, complete with addresses, pointers, integers and registers. That's why I also like LLVM as it abstracts away different instruction sets into a generic high-level instruction set, much like C abstracts different assembly languages into a generic high-level assembly language.<p>C also has the property of being most enjoyable code to read. I've spent a lot of time just reading C out of sheer enjoyment. C is tricky: it can be a total mess or it can be terse and beautiful and clear. No matter what, it describes exactly what it does to my machine. Read some of D.J. Bernsteins source trees to get an idea of how neat C can be.",1338633370

Funky App 2 at half price, and to be able to notify users of the app at that new price.<p>The rationale behind this is that users can still be notified of major release versions without forcing them to upgrade or die (sometimes people continue to support older versions for a bit while the new version gets traction). For example, the new version of Coda when it came out was pretty buggy compared to the older more stable version and app store reviews showed it, but there's no way for people buying Coda 2 on the app store to upgrade to Coda 3 at an upgrade price when it comes out. Having the ability to provide a discount for not only Coda 3, but other Panic software at upgrade time could generate more sales for things like Transmit etc.<p>I'm not singling out Panic, just a recent example.",1338631981

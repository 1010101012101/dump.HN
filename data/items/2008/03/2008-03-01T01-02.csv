I hope it works out for them because I don't see too many other options that would generate positive value for a company.<p>Google could probably implement it on their own (not to trivialize the work, but to point out that Gmail basically has all the information and fast search, they just need to mine the contact network).<p>The typical Yahoo user probably wouldn't care for it.<p>That said, it would be an ironic purchase for MS, because from my standpoint they already bought and burried the search tech with LookOut to push their Desktop search client. But that's for MS to justify, not Xobni.",1204336371

So it was user->shared host->laptop->desktop with database->laptop and all the way back for every request.<p>Latency wasn't really that bad as long as the shared host was nearby.",1204336354

The problem is finding a connection with a decent uplink.  The two big ISPs in my area, Comcast and AT&T limit you to 768kbps, and I think both also block port 80.<p>And as far as I know, getting SDSL or a T1 is gonna set you back a few hundred a month, at which point you're better off getting a dedicated box.",1204335873

Upcoming.org was based out of some weekend and late-night hacks, and the founders never quit their day jobs before being acquired.<p>del.icio.us was a one-man band for years, and even when the site started getting major attention, the founder, Joshua Schachter, was working full time on Wall Street. He says that he found ways to be productive when he had just 15 minutes free. (I recently asked him about that and he said that one of the techniques that helped was shorter methods, nothing longer than a page. That's an interesting real-world metric for how readability = value.)",1204335021

The talks about holism vs reductionism, the introduction to programming with in it, extending to writing programs that write themselves and other strange loops are all very relevant.<p>Perhaps most relevant of all is learning how such varied fields relate. It's all very well being a hacker, but working out how hacking is a general thing not specific to computers is quite edifying. Learning how the tenents of the hacker are seen in religion, philosophy and art as well as science is quite profound.",1187845064

45495,comment,45081,45081,0,0,jsnx,,,"The author overstates some of his claims. For example, European women made excellent contributions to herbal medicine -- the only medicine around -- until the rise of 'scientific' medicine, which caused as much as harm as good for much of its early history. The author claims that medicine was all men's doing.<p>This tendency to overstatement manifests as a pervasive one cause fallacy. There are many reasons for womens' and mens' relative different status -- some long term and unchanging (the politics of birth), some short term and malleable (prejudices relating to relative intellectual capacities), many in between these extremes. The author acknowledges the manifold causes of gender differences only to dismiss them -- and the motivating factors for women's cultural creation are left unexplored.\n",1187843233

They went with a simplistic, anti-""feature creep"" approach with the Palm Pilot.  It's characterized by their simplistic operating system, and they never tried to innovate that personal appliance, such as an iPhone, etc.  They released the Treo, and it only had minimal success.  Also, remember Handspring released the Treo, and then merged to form PalmOne.<p>If hindsight is 20/20, then they could have made some riskier moves, and these ideas coincide with the article in some respects.<p>- Open up the OS.  They should have made it a geek toy.  Let the Linux master in all of us come out.<p>- Supported 3rd party software with moral support.  They should have had a ""killer app"".<p>- Made it into a gaming device.  I don't know if the processing power and battery-life were there, but it could have been another direction.<p>- Better marketing.  In line with all these points above, they should made it ""cooler"".  It should have been the province of business people to own a Palm.  Everyone should own one, because you'll be cool.  <p>Take these together and you have the iPhone.  Congratulations Apple!  RIP Palm.",1187842411

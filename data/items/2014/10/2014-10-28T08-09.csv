8520009,comment,8517187,8519243,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I&#x27;ve heard these arguments a million times. IDs are not that difficult to get or people who needed them to function in other spheres wouldn&#x27;t be able to get them either. So some DMV offices were open weird hours or required traveling some distance. Well yes, Wisconsin is a pretty low density state and the same problems obtain in any rural area.<p>The argument I&#x27;m making (and which people keep missing) is not that Democrats should be paying for people&#x27;s birth certificates out of party funds, but that Democrats should be saying &#x27;Yes, we support voter ID&#x27; and then using that position as political leverage to obtain funding for/make administrative changes to/launch lawsuits over deliberate barriers placed in the path of people who are being hindered from getting the ID they&#x27;re entitled to have.<p>Have you noticed how the mainstream Republicans manage to play both ends of the immigration issue? They say they want reform, but that the border has to be secured first. Democrats should be saying &#x27;we want voter ID law, but we need to fix the state&#x27;s administration system first so people can get their ID.&#x27; Instead they say &#x27;oh no voter ID is evil&#x27; and give the Republicans (and the Tea Party in particular) a free hand to say that Democrats want to commit electoral fraud, because the Democrats are too previous to pay lip service to people who are worried about voter fraud.<p>This is an extremely stupid position to take. Refusing to even pay lip service to the idea of voter ID provides bomb-throwers like the Tea Party with the perfect opportunity to delegitimize any Democratic electoral victory, and has made it harder for complaints about things like voting machine integrity to gain traction. There seems to be substantial majority in favor of voter ID laws (70-80%, looking at major polling organizations), yet Democrats continue to cling to what is obviously a losing strategy instead of trying to own the solution. This translates into lost votes from people who don&#x27;t trust them - I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it consistently loses them 1-3% every election.<p>For example, take a look at this McClatchy/Marist poll from last year: <a href=""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/07/25/197687/marist-poll-for-mcclatchy-on-voting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/07/25/197687/marist-poll-for...</a><p>There is <i>no demographic</i> that does not have <i>strong</i> majority support for photo ID laws. Even Democrats, even non-whites, even the elderly, even the less well off - all have strong majorities in favor of photo ID requirements to vote. The same demographics that think discrimination in voting is a significant problem <i>also</i> express strong support for voter ID requirements. It&#x27;s not the most rational position for voters to hold, but that&#x27;s never stopped them before.<p>It&#x27;s time for the Democratic party to recognize that it already lost this argument several years ago. Its current position is the political equivalent of punching itself in the face, every damn election.<p><i>I think the problem here is that you&#x27;re approaching this problem the wrong way: you&#x27;re coming to it with the impression that getting a photo ID is a low bar. The problem is that, for whatever reason (budget cuts? malice?) photo IDs are _difficult_ to get for the same people that need them.</i><p>I&#x27;m an illegal alien. I don&#x27;t need <i>you</i> to tell me about how difficult photo ID is to get.",1414486234

8520004,comment,8519801,8519932,0,0,ganzuul,,,"From the same site, quantitative analysis:<p>&quot;The chi-square test is the most commonly used test for the randomness of data, and is extremely sensitive to errors in pseudorandom sequence generators. The chi-square distribution is calculated for the stream of bytes in the file and expressed as an absolute number and a percentage which indicates how frequently a truly random sequence would exceed the value calculated. We interpret the percentage as the degree to which the sequence tested is suspected of being non-random. If the percentage is greater than 99% or less than 1%, the sequence is almost certainly not random. If the percentage is between 99% and 95% or between 1% and 5%, the sequence is suspect. Percentages between 90% and 95% and 5% and 10% indicate the sequence is “almost suspect”. Note that our JPEG file, while very dense in information, is far from random as revealed by the chi-square test.<p>Applying this test to the output of various pseudorandom sequence generators is interesting. The low-order 8 bits returned by the standard Unix rand() function, for example, yields:<p><pre><code>    Chi square distribution for 500000 samples is 0.01, and randomly would exceed this value more than 99.99 percent of the times. 
</code></pre>
While an improved generator [Park & Miller] reports:<p><pre><code>    Chi square distribution for 500000 samples is 212.53, and randomly would exceed this value 97.53 percent of the times. 
</code></pre>
Thus, the standard Unix generator (or at least the low-order bytes it returns) is unacceptably non-random, while the improved generator is much better but still sufficiently non-random to cause concern for demanding applications. Contrast both of these software generators with the chi-square result of a genuine random sequence created by timing radioactive decay events.<p><pre><code>    Chi square distribution for 500000 samples is 249.51, and randomly would exceed this value 40.98 percent of the times. &quot;

8519997,comment,8519862,8519862,0,0,hkmurakami,,,"I came in thinking that this was going to be about the Baidu IME Japanese language input (which caused quite a stir earlier this year iirc, for the same kind of logging and tracking -- though I think the information wasn&#x27;t as extensive as this). Lo and behold, it&#x27;s much worse than that.<p>Wasn&#x27;t it Sony that installed some kind of spyware in its VAIO machines or its anti-piracy SW or something along those lines? When will they ever learn? And there will likely never be an explanation for what they were trying to do here.<p>They are already in a precarious position in the smartphone market with most of their sales coming from Japan (and Sony Ericsson becoming just Sony Mobile back in 2012). What were they going to do if shit really hit the fan and this went to mass media in Japan as the &quot;Chinese spyware phone&quot; given the tension between the two countries, especially given Japanese QE over the last 1.5+ years? Consumer sentiment is pretty irrational. I can easily see a situation where they get labeled as a &quot;traitorous company&quot; and a boycott starts, at least vs their mobile division. Shortsightedness at its finest.<p>I want to root for this company so badly yet every few years they do boneheaded things like this and make me utterly despise their stupidity.<p>edit: On further thought I bet this is created by some pre-installed default Baidu app that Sony QA didn&#x27;t vet properly or didn&#x27;t give a damn about. Or maybe QA found the folder + the connection to China, but it was quashed by management for &quot;strategic reasons&quot;.

Yes, the Google Cargo cult is frightening. Things that previously where scorned at is now raised to the skies.
But we have to remember that is also a completely new generation of developers out there who have not lived thru the entire painful history of web development, so therefore the same mistakes will repeat it selves.
It should be obvious now by most rational people that Angular 1.x is a dead end and if you build your own architecture around it you will continue to dig yourselves a deeper and deeper hole that will become harder and harder to get up from.
Angular 2 looks more promising with it&#x27;s modularity and that should be the lessoned learned.
The web is just a way too fast moving target that any framework can keep up with, because the idea of a framework is the opposite for fast moving progress, i.e. stabilization of risks. And thats why so many javascript frameworks have already died even thou the web is really young.
The road ahead must be modularity and not the the way of the monolithic frameworks. Interoperability and interchangeability. Things we ought to have learned after the Prototype.js years. Or after the Dojo years. Or after the ExtJS years. Or ...

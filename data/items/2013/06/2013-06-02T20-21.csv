5810070,comment,5806970,5808323,5,0,MetaCosm,,,"As a pragmatist and someone who enjoys Haskell and F#, I find your comments very academic.  There will always be less popular, feature packed fun languages like Rust, Haskell and OCaml, and there will always be teams that use them to great advantage (Jane Street).  But IMHO, lots of these systems are a little creaky in the support structures (cabal for example) and deploy features.<p>That said, I think a lot of what makes Go great is because of its simplicity, lack of surprises, and general lack of cleverness.  You can get your hands around the language features very easily, in mere hours.<p>Beyond that, I think the ease of building tooling on top of the AST (or in general), the ease of deploying code to production, the build speeds, the inclusion of go get and fmt, the policies around imports and variable use (use or lose) all add up to be more than the sum of its parts.  It is very obviously built by a team looking to use it in production, on real projects, as soon as possible.",1370206785

5810004,comment,5807941,5807941,18,0,Jun8,,,"I've been following the events since the beginning (in fact I was there at the solitary meeting in Chicago yesterday: <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-local-demonstration-supports-turkey-protests-20130601,0,5732219.story"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-local-...</a>), so let me summarize what's been going on. However, if you have time to read just a single post, read this (<a href=""http://technosociology.org/?p=1255"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technosociology.org/?p=1255</a>) spot on analysis instead of my comment.<p>First, it's not an Istanbul thing anymore, many Turkish cities, especially Izmir and Ankara witnessed large protests and clashes with the police in the past couple of days.<p>On paper, this started with a small group of protesters sitting in the park to stop its demolition and cutting down the trees on Monday. That evening and at 5am on Tuesday morning they were violently attacked by the police. The attacks continued on Wednesday. The appalling police brutality unfortunately is nothing new in Turkey but this time it triggered an unexpected reaction from a wide swath of people.<p>People's discontent with AKP has been rising for some time, although they have provided a stable economy for the past 10 years. Some of the recent events have really notched it up, though, e.g.:<p>* The fact that government made no official plans to celebrate the May 19th holiday, which is an important day in the creation of the Turkish Republic (mirroring their approach to the October 29th holiday, which is like July 4th for Turkey)<p>* Lack of adequate response from PM Erdogan to the bombing in Reyhanli. Rather than cancel his visit to the US to visit the town, he went with his original plan. A lot of people thought that he brought such terrorist activities on Turkey due to his agressive rhetoric on Essad and his strong support of the dissidents there.<p>* The recent ban on the sale of alcohol between 10pm and 6am (<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/31/turkey-alcohol-laws-istanbul-nightlife"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/31/turkey-alcohol-l...</a>). This was an unheard-of move that angered a lot of people, not because Turkey consumes a lot of alcohol but it was interpreted as a step to the Islamic Law.<p>What really surprised me (and I witnessed many a protest and a few military coups there) was the exponential growth of the protest and its apolitical nature. Before, people used to write the usual leftist slogans on the walls, this time there were a lot of funny graffiti about Erdogan, the police and the pepper gas (examples at <a href=""https://eksisozluk.com/gezi-parki-isgali-duvar-yazilari--3858340"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eksisozluk.com/gezi-parki-isgali-duvar-yazilari--385...</a>, for Turkish readers).<p>Due to the wide use of social media there were some disinfomation as expected, spread around by excited people, e.g. that the police was using Agent Orange. This was due to the China-like complacency of the Turkish media. In fact, when CNN International was transmitting live from the riots in Istanbul CNN Turk was running a documentary about penguins! The reason for this is two-fold: the intimidation of reporters in the past 2-3 years (e.g. see the OdaTV case, where the owner of a TV station and reporters were swiftly jailed with scant evidence when they criticized the government: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/world/europe/soner-yalcin-owner-and-editor-of-odatv-freed-from-prison.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/world/europe/soner-yalcin-...</a>). The other reason is the financial blackmail that the government exercises over large media conglomerates, e.g. when the Dogan group got a colossal $2.3B tax fine in 2009.",1370205712
5810003,comment,5809281,5809281,10,0,cletus,,,"Here is why patent reform is a problem in US politics.<p>The Democrats are essentially the political wing of the American Bar Association. They are bought and paid for and represent the interests of trial lawyers. Lawyers make a lot of money from the current patent system. This is the same reason Democrats oppose tort reform to reduce frivolous class action suits (of course it's all in the name of the little guy getting his day in court).<p>The Republicans are beholden to big business (and the religious right). As much as big players are suffering the death of a thousand cuts in the current system no one is going out of business because of it. What's more arguably it hurts the smaller players more.<p>The patent mess is nothing new. Patents stifling innovation is nothing new. Benjamin Franklin was notably against patents [1]. The Wright brothers started a patent war [2] that completely paralyzed the US aviation industry to the point that when the US entered WWI it was completely incapable of producing planes and had to buy them from Europe. This eventually took Congressional action to resolve resulting in the system that exists today (aviation patent licensing).<p>Pharmaceuticals are the thorny problem here. It's true that it takes hundreds of millions to bring a drug to market and it's easy to reproduce so some protection is required.<p>But at the same time drug companies spend most of their money on marketing not research. Patents are effectively extended by slightly changing a molecule (sometimes making the drug less effective) and getting a patent extension, which they then push doctors to prescribe (over the generic) leaving consumers and insurance carriers to foot the bill.<p>But software is easy. Just get rid of them all. You can't patent mathematical formula. Algorithms, as all those with even a rudimentary CS education know, are just mathematical formulae. How the courts haven't worked this out yet is a mystery.<p>And of course there are the patents on ""swipe to unlock"" and similar obvious ""inventions"", which should never have been granted in the first place.<p>If two people can come up with the same idea independently then it probably shouldn't be patentable. The idea that you can write software that ends up infringing on any number of patents you know nothing about is beyond scary.<p>Yet the US continues to push foreign powers to tow the US line on software patents (with mixed results), which isn't helped by the current Obama administration, which has to be by far the most IP holder friendly administration in US history (between the original ACTA, stuffing the DoJ and the Federal bench with RIAA/MPAA lawyers, pursuing the Swartz case beyond all reason through the US Attorney, etc ad nauseum).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://movingtofreedom.org/2006/08/31/ben-franklin-on-patents/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://movingtofreedom.org/2006/08/31/ben-franklin-on-patent...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers_patent_war"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers_patent_war</a>",1370205672

The solution is, however, not to say ""well, science didn't work out, let's try  to go back to the caves"" - the solution is to keep working.<p>>>> What you support is a matter of what seems trustworthy.<p>This is exactly the problem - the support becomes political and relies not on what is actually better but on whose lobbyists are better and whose PR campaign is more successful. This venerable tradition started a long time ago, with Edison's shenanigans[1] to give him edge over the competitors. The story of DDT is another example - while the scientific basis for the book that destroyed the DDT - Silent Spring - remain shaky[2] and the ban ended up costing millions of lives of malaria victims, it is still considered an example of how science is going to doom us all. Another example is the continuing PR battle between sugar lobby and corn lobby. Initially, corn lobby was winning - that's why HFCS is called ""high fructose"" - because once fructose was good and glucose was bad, so the marketing term emphasized the good part, even though some varieties of HFCS have less fructose than table sugar, and commonly used one has only very slightly more [3]. Due to this and as the effect of the insanely high sugar tariffs, US industry switched from sugar to HFCS. Now the tide has turned and HFCS is becoming the bane of our age. And now the corn lobby wants to go back to ""corn sugar"", but so far they weren't allowed to. Corn guys though did another number in ""biofuels"", so even if they lose the HFCS thing, they have other victories in their belt.<p>This is all to say ""what seems trustworthy"" is a very poor guide, since most information you'd see in popular press is probably worthless. And decisions made by politicians are probably based on random factors having nothing to do with actual merits of proposed solutions.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Currents"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Currents</a>

So what makes this agreement between King Saud and 30+ other powers a valid cause for the King's subjects, or anybody else, to wage war against the US? What makes Usama bin Laden the superior authority to say who is allowed to live in Arabia? What justifies forbidding people from holding any other religious belief than the approved one? What makes Usama bin Laden the sole authority on religious matters in Arabia who can decide what religion people are allowed to believe?",1370204780

This part stood out for me "" I wasnt demanded of much: maybe to keep my room clean and to help out around the house occasionally.""<p>Sometimes I wonder if there isn't a niche for someone to teach people like this how to live a little better. Like really basic things people used to take for granted such as cooking, being outside, and eating meals with friends and family.<p>It took spending some time on a family farm to make my realize that while I had ""success"" I had a very low quality of life, one that just wasn't worth it in the long run. It makes me sad to see posts about things like ""Soylent."" It's like how much of humanity can we prune off in the pursuit of coding as much as possible?<p>I quit my Manhattan job with the long commute and moved to a cheaper, though still vibrant city. I sleep eight hours a night, I cook meals from scratch, I have friends I see almost every day, I walk to work, and in general my quality of life is very very high. My job is fairly ""boring"", but I have the energy to work on my own side projects.<p>Don't forget that you are not a robot.

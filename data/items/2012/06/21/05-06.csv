I mention this in the paper. I have provided a data point not a proof. It took me a couple months of several hours a day to the do the translation, I hope more people translate more programs to see if the results hold in the face of a larger data set. Second I agree the quality of the Python code isn't that great. I wanted to see whether unit testing obviated static typing in practice. In order to avoid selection bias I choose the projects at random. I picked the first four projects that were < 2000 lines of code and that had some sort of unit testing.<p>I believe that my methodology, nor my conclusions are flawed but that all should remember that a single experiment does not make a scientific proof.

4140651,comment,4138009,4138009,2,0,schme,,,"Back in high school I felt the same way. I couldn't understand why I went out. When I didn't I felt bad and as if I was doing something very unnatural. I come from a smallish town where everyone knew each other. After awhile I got to be known as the boy who didn't go out, which hurt.\nAfter a few years I got over it. I realized I didn't dislike going out per se, the people in the small town just weren't people I liked, we never 'clicked'. You can't like everyone and as I realized this I started going out and being with friends and doing all the stuff I had missed out on.<p>It's not about being an extrovert or introvert, it's more about not understanding why other people and/or yourself put certain demands on yourself when you feel like something else. Nowadays I don't care about what I 'should' do or what I'm expected to do. Not doing something like going to someones birthday party has certain implications to people, but I understand where it's coming. Now I make a choice between the consequences of my actions, not because an abstract idea of having to do something.",1340255702

First of all I completely agree that my sample size is too small for a conclusive proof. I mention in the paper that I hope that others will try and replicate this experiment on other pieces of software. I do think it's appropriate when conducting an experiment to publish a conclusion, not that the experiment will constitute proof (or an established scientific theory), but as a conclusion to the study that others can try to confirm or refute.<p>I also mention in the paper that it would be beneficial to conduct this experiment using different type systems for the reasons that you stated above.<p>The argument against static typing that I was testing didn't mention any particular type system nor any particular dynamically typed language, it was a general argument that stated that unit testing obviated static typing. Because the argument was so general and absolute I felt that any static type system that could be shown to expose bugs that were not caught by unit testing would be enough to refute the argument. I was not trying to prove that <i>any</i> type system would catch bugs not found by <i>any</i> unit tested software. The paper also points out that I'm trying to see whether unit testing obviates static typing in practice, in theory you could implement a poor mans type checker as unit tests, but my experiment was focused on whether in practice unit testing obviates static typing.<p>Finally I believe that my conclusion in the paper was at least a bit more modest than that of the blog post. The lack of apparent modesty in the blog post was caused more by a lack of ability on my part to accurately summarize than an inflated sense of accomplishment and self importance.",1340254848

5244584,comment,5243890,5243890,4,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">He suggests one way to prevent dangerous, illegal usage of 3-D printers is to better control gunpowder, an idea that has come up in gun control in the past.<p>Isn't gunpowder pretty easy to manufacture too? Not with a 3D printer, obviously, but with common materials and a cursory knowledge of chemistry.<p>>When I tell them the law that would stop these plastic guns from getting onto planes is expiring in just a few months, people are appalled.<p>This is the essence of missing the point. The issue with 3D printed weapons is that you <i>can't</i> ban them. I have to imagine that it's already illegal to bring a gun onto a plane, so he has to be talking about banning their manufacture, which is the exact thing 3D printing will make moot.<p>Can we please at some point graduate from trying to prohibit anything with a sharp edge and instead try to address crime and terrorism at the root? I realize that isn't as profitable with campaign contributors or as rhetorically effective in frightening the voters, but the point of a representative rather than direct democracy is that legislators are supposed to make hard or unpopular decisions when it's necessary.",1361285970

5244574,comment,5241977,5242660,1,0,ctdonath,,,"No. ""Purchasing power parity"" fails to take into account a host of tangential & overhead costs. Sounds good to compare what a product costs in two countries in the same currency, and to note the difference in price, but there is so much more affecting those prices even though in ""fairness"" they should be the ""same"".<p><rant> An overstated example... A dozen eggs here may be $2.00, and $0.10 somewhere else, but the former includes: sale in a store clean enough to host surgery in the other country, well-paid staff (staving off their potential poverty), robust packaging, long-term storage facilities, remarkable uniformity of products (each egg almost exactly the same size, shape, and color), proliferation of taxes imposed, long-distance transportation (keeping farming issues out of urban settings), compliance with regulations (starting with: no livestock in residential areas), wages reflecting a very high standard of living (imposed not just by society but by legislation), and quality feed & care of originating chickens; in the other country, the dozen eggs may be delivered in a random box by a guy who has chickens in his back yard and feeds them table scraps. Yeah the same product cost 20x more in the same currency in different countries: there's a radical difference in supply chains, regulations, taxation, and currency flow. </rant>",1361285913

5244570,comment,5244192,5244472,3,0,mediagearbox,,,"""This part is easily and affordably done online, and possibly more effective for some people.""<p>That sums it up for me.  I work full-time along with my side projects and I still chug along at getting a degree, running all over the city is not in my favor for taking classes.  Online classes have not only saved me money but created more time to take on other projects that pay for more classes.<p>In regards to cheating, honestly it is just as easy to cheat in class as it is online.  BUT this is not factoring the personalities. Some people cheat because they do not really care, others do NOT cheat because by cheating (in my mind) you are cheating yourself.<p>Lastly, online classes have taught me something far more valuable than a brick and mortar class - RESPONSIBILITY.  For me (key phrase) going to class was not only troublesome in my day to day but horrifically boring. On top of which with campus classes you get more of the professors personal opinions on matters rather than actual material that you can base your studies off of to generate your own opinion or hypothesis.  With online classes I plan my weeks in advance from quizzes and tests, to writing papers and doing research and of course incorporating my needed day to day duties.<p>As a student who has taken both campus classes and online classes, I would have to say that online classes are more challenging.",1361285881

It doesn't matter what industry, this will always fail.<p>Online shopping, for example, isn't just a easy access to the products found at a brick and mortar store; it is an entirely different way to shop. Amazon realizes this and knows that sometimes people want cheap (hdmi cables) and other times good quality (chef knives).<p>Khan Academy gets it. You don't take a 'math course' but you answer questions and watch videos and you know how well you are doing in a general area. You know when you should study something more and you know when you are solid.<p>I would love to see all online courses abandoned and instead follow a khan academy approach. Drop the course idea and instead have thousands of goals where each goal can be tracked by how well you handle problems.<p>I used to teach in colleges and the number one reason a student became confused wasn't because they weren't as smart as the other students but something small that they missed. It could be as simple as not knowing how ftp works, or not being used to a *nix environment, or not knowing where environment variables are set in a windows environment. This same person might have decades of ide-based-java experience but struggle when asked to compile on the command line. The khan academy approach would distill all of these concepts into goals and would determine what should be your next area to study (looks like you got lost on using ftp, let's cover a few videos of that before we move into the next section).",1361285822

5244559,comment,5243908,5243908,5,0,cypherdog,,,"I currently work for the web communications part of a small-to-medium size university. We have around 2000 employees and 8000 students. We embrace all google products on campus. We actually use gmail for our primary email system. We use google forms to collect data throughout our website (not perfect by a long shot, but makes data collection approachable and accessible to end users). We would never shut down google forms. We simply couldn't. We regulate mass email by only allowing a select few individuals to email to all users. We have literally a dozen or so users on campus that can send an email to all users, and most are in the communications department or IT. All this talk of authentication systems, and teaching users not to get caught by phishing, sounds like ""ideal world"" solutions. Our solution is simple. If you want to send out an email to everyone, send it to a central authority that can approve the sending. It is easier to make sure a dozen people have the skill to send a mass email appropriately and avoid phishing attempts, then it is ten thousand. Also, it has the added advantage to allow us to consolidate less urgent emails into a single newsletter once a week, keeping faculty/staff and students email boxes free of non-urgent notifications. I'm not pretending we have a perfect solution, but it seems like we'd never get approval to stop using google docs in a situation like this. I'm actually rather impressed by Oxford's ability to react and then write a long and thorough explanation of their actions.",1361285787

If you spend a few hours reading the FAQ on that site, plus examine.com's nutrition articles, and reddit.com/r/leangains FAQs, you will come out with a much better understanding of your diet.<p>There are also calculators listed in the FAQs that will help you determine what you need to eat to maintain your bodyweight, lose fat, gain muscle, etc, over a user-selected window of time.<p>First thing I realized - that the difference between tracking your ""macros"" and not is like programming with Word or with vi/emacs/slickedit/etc - the difference is AMAZING.<p>The next thing I realized - is that to get enough protein if you're even moderately active, you have to eat A LOT - eggs, milk, meat, tuna, and even then I still have to supplement with protein supplements.<p>Now, combine the diet knowledge with a beginner weight training program like Starting Strength and the effect is amazing. I've gained 10 pounds of muscle and lost 10 lbs of fat. I've doubled all my lift numbers (which are still admittedly quite low) in four months.

Salt takes advantage of a number of technologies and techniques. The networking layer is built with the excellent ZeroMQ networking library, so the Salt daemon includes a viable and transparent AMQ broker. Salt uses public keys for authentication with the master daemon, then uses faster AES encryption for payload communication; authentication and encryption are integral to Salt. Salt takes advantage of communication via msgpack, enabling fast and light network traffic.

Email them a fishy message ultimately asking them their password for instance, the same way an attacker would. Of course, some phishing emails / sites look incredibly legit but in my experience most have noticeable deficiencies. If your users can spot at least those, then they can protect against a good number of attacks.

Some compilers are tuned too much for looking good on artificial benchmarks, in which turning 3-line loops into thousands of instructions sometimes helps, even if it hurts on most real-world code.<p>> And if I don't want the compiler to do this, I have no idea how to stop this behavior, nor do I want to invest in the specific knowledge of the nuances any particular compiler.<p>The -O0 option, or its equivalent, is pretty easy to find in many compilers. If you're happy with the performance of your code without all those fancy techniques being applied, feel free to use it. Most people aren't ;-).<p>> P.S. Oh, and by the way if I really wasn't using half of the code I wrote, I would throw the source code away.<p>Only if you were aware of it ;-). I wish that compilers would focus a little more on helping me make my code better, rather than so much on magically making things better under the covers.",1361282967

Surely this removes all security of contact-less payment?<p>In summary the process works as follows:
  1. Youre issued with a contactless compatible card which features a logo similar to the Wi-Fi logo on the card: http://productreviewsuk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/barclayscard.jpg
  2. The contactless compatible reader prompts you with a price, green light and if the purchase is less than 15   asks you to present your card for contact-less, else insert it as usual and use your PIN
  3. You hold the card on the reader, wait for all the green lights to fill and then wait for an approved message
  4. Leave with your shiny new item (or in my case lunch!)
Heres a YouTube video showing how it works if you havent had a chance to use contactless http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBQjxY-3_uU&feature=player_detailpage#t=34s<p>I know how to use these readers, I actually think its very clear and easy to use. Ill wait for the prompt, check the price and then present the card for payment. However, as mentioned in my introduction, the person at the checkout keeps on taking the card from my hand and placing it on the reader, meaning I dont have a chance to confirm the price, I could be paying up to 15 without my direct consent.<p>The problem however is that this is becoming the social norm, and when I've mentioned Id prefer not to handover my card to the cashier I've been made to feel like Im being deliberately awkward or taking control for the sake of it!<p>What do you think? Have you experienced the same thing? Is there anything that could be done to fix this? Should cashiers be given extra training and guidelines on specifically not doing this?",1361282932

Well, that's not a very good example because you can tell GCC to do exactly that, but it's not a standard C feature and the compiler cannot do that on its own across translation units. So it's one of those situations where you can ""outsmart"" the compiler, even if the compiler would probably tell you it's not fair game :)",1361282719

Look-mummy-my-first-SIMD-routine is usually within spitting distance of the compiler's best effort, and a lot neater-looking. Then you can just take it from there.<p>The compiler's output is far from useless, because compilers generally know a few tricks and/or cute sequences that you can copy. And using intrinsics is certainly better than relying on it to automatically vectorize things itself - I've never heard of that do anything remotely interesting. But, even though it's 2013, it still seems like the compiler is easier to beat by hand than you'd think.<p>I make no claim that this is worth doing in every case.<p>(As for the suggestion that the compiler can't rearrange inline assembly language, or provide symbolic register names - whyever not? Perhaps people have been conditioned by gcc and VC++ never to expect anything except the absolute bare minimum from inline assembly language support, but that's no reason to assume that these tasks are impossible. Code Warrior for Wii would rearrange assembly language for you to avoid holdups due to instruction latencies, and while automatically assigning registers for you. I believe most modern assemblers will do similar reordering and at least let you assign names to the registers you're using.)",1361282543

As soon as the battle was over Rothworth quickly returned to London, delivering the news to Rothschild 24 hours ahead of Wellington's courier. A victory by Napoleon would have devastated Britain's financial system. Nathan stationed himself in his usual place next to an ancient pillar in the stock market. Knowing he would be observed he hung his head and began openly to sell huge numbers of British Government Bonds. Believing this to mean that Napoleon must have won, everyone started to sell their British Bonds as well. The bottom fell out of the market.

Once the App Store was released, there was no way Apple would allow out-of-band application development technologies.<p>So what happened is that, to reach this new segment of the market, web developers needed to develop two versions of their applications -- one for iOS and one for everybody else. This in turn spurred development of non-native web technologies, for those applications where a fully native version wasn't feasible, which further reduced the demand for Flash. Adobe was forced to try and play catch up, and that's a really tough position to be in.<p>Good riddance, but I'm fully expecting Flash's niche as a provider of abusive advertisement and wretched restaurant menus to be filled soon enough.

The multiplayer deathmatch allows one team to take the role of monsters, who have the backing of the zombie horde to make up for lack of guns. Playing it really provides some interesting insights to how the AI effectively functions, by slowly getting the human players to come unglued, either by targeting stragglers or letting the best players get too overconfident and move ahead of the team. Of course, all deathmatch games have this dynamic but it's very explicit in L4D, mostly because it's impossible for one human or monster player to singlehandedly own the opposing team in the way that an ace player can miraculously wipe out a team in Counter-Strike.<p>edit: The AI controlled human players is extremely competent, maybe the best bot players yet created. But they do show their limitations in multiplayer...among their weaknesses: they're too willing to sacrifice their healthpacks for an injured teammate, and will almost always try to help an incapacitated player no matter how hopeless his/her cause. Real humans can be total assholes, but in some situations its best for the team to leave a straggler behind, especially if the enemy has set up an ambush for the rescuers.",1366808079

API to customise PDF templates with data<p>FULL SUMMARY:
It's really hard and costy to build your own print customisation process(without the hassle of using PDF librairies) and especially for a small website unless you are ready to spend $120 000 (XMPie) to get an old style java/.net library to integrate it  with XML message as a way to submit data.
Why would you need that? 
Let say you manage a website for a designer.
Each artwork is at the moment sold only once. Now the designer would like to take an already created artwork and use it for different customers.
As an example, let's take a business card PDF.
Customers visiting would be able to fill in an HTML form with name, address, title and phone number and get a PDF produce automatically with these information updated, without having any more integration work (for the designer).
We provide: a web interface to configure and manage templates, a widget to add into your website to automatically create the form and an API to send directly the data if you don't want to use the snippet.
Languages used to define the customisation config would be CSS and JS/JSON.
Business cards, posters but also payrolls or any PDF related file could be easily produce or sold many times. Moreover, you pay by request.",1366807454

The good universities in Germany are public universities (TU Mnchen, TU Erlangen). Private universities exist for a few years now, but so far they haven't proven that they can reliably deliver the same quality. (There certainly are exceptions).<p>2. For technology fields, southern Germany is better than northern Germany.<p>3. Computer science (""Informatik""): Bigger universities are better, check out what research is being done at the university before applying. If you do your standard degrees (in Germany this is a bachelor and a master), you will, from your bachelor thesis on, be involved in actual research activities.<p>4. For electrical/mechanical engineering, good criteria for university selection are: Is there a major technology center nearby (Mnchen, Stuttgart, Rhein-Main)? Is it a TU (Technische Universitt)?  Does it have more than 10000 Students?<p>5. Forget about Berlin (at least for a moment). Berlin is _the_ place for the ""young and hip"" startup scene in Germany, but for historical reasons, it is not traditionally a technology center. The biggest German IT technology center  is in the Rhein-Main-Neckar area. There are a bunch of universities (TU Darmstadt, TU Heidelberg...) and many ""traditional"" companies (SAP, Banking services...). You are also close to Frankfurt, which is a very central travel hub (Frankfurt airport obviously, but also the train station.) There might even appear a direct train connection to London in the near future. At the moment, you have to change trains once, in Brusseles.<p>I hope this helps someone. There are certainly also great technology/IT universities in the Netherlands and some northern and eastern european countries, so further research is advised.",1366807404

I've had the exact same realization about the deadlines being arbitrary, and ever since I realized the engineering talent gets to set the deadlines, I ignore most of what's dictated to me and I set them back. The management at my company can't do much about it because regardless of how long it takes, the work I do is the important technology work in the company and none of the other developers could do it (not now at least, maybe in a few years).<p>There was a bullshit fake article written by someone at facebook this week, some tongue in cheek thing about how awesome it is to work at facebook as a developer.

Yet more human beings, subject to the same failures of judgment as the people who you claim are incapable of effectively assessing risk?<p>If the latter, where's the evidence that there ever was a breach of that understanding?  Reward is proportional to risk, and those seeking high-interest investment opportunities implicitly acknowledge that with higher return comes higher risk.<p>> Noone considers full chain of risks.<p>Plenty of people do, and where sufficient information to make a confident risk judgement is unavailable, plenty of people take <i>that</i> into account and plan accordingly.<p>""Most people"" do not feel they are immortal or perpetual winners; indeed, although the systemic effects of the financial crisis have impacted us all, the number of people who <i>did not</i> engage in irrational real-estate speculation far exceeds those who did. (The ""everyone"" I mentioned above refers to <i>segments</i> of the chain of investment, not to individuals in general).<p>> The only thing we can do is set up barriers to curb the risky behavior<p>No; there are plenty of other viable alternatives, like providing mechanisms to <i>insulate</i> unwilling third parties against the risk-taking activities of others.  Most public policy and regulatory intervention seems to do the exact opposite, however, and seeks to shoehorn everyone in society into a single uniform pattern of interaction, which, of course, exposes us all to the new systemic risks it creates and doesn't account for, and leaves us little room for escape.<p>Let's regard regulation as what it is: a flawed attempt to mitigate the downside of universal social systems in order to <i>sustain</i> those systems, and justify corralling everyone into them in order to maximize their putative upside.  The problem is that it just doesn't work: at best we're reducing small and predictable risk impacts for massive and chaotic ones, which doesn't yield an environment suited to evolutionary resilience.<p>As in everything else, variation is the key to stability and survival, and top-down regulation of individuals' subjective risk judgments diminishes variation.  We need lots of separate baskets to put our eggs in, not one giant over-engineered basket that's ultimately no more unbreakable than the Titanic was unsinkable.",1366806313

I have a friend who has followed the opposite strategy, always asking for and fighting for the most he can squeeze out of an employer and life.

I think this works because unlike what many people seem to think, the other side aren't typically sociopaths trying to squeeze the last drop of blood out of the employees.  But they will respond that way when pushed.<p>People generally have a solid understanding of what is fair and what isn't.

Should I develop it further?<p>Many thanks in advance!<p>-Nina, nina@userium.com, <a href=""http://userium.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://userium.com</a>",1366805097

Average investors should not have been affected at all.<p>(Some probably were affected due to stop-loss orders, but those simply should not be used-- index mutual funds are a perfectly good way to gain equities exposure.)",1366805039

5600988,comment,5600532,5600736,4,0,phyalow,,,"It's nothing to do with ""high frequency"" or high volume trading. It's grounded in the fact that firms base their trading strategy on scraped sentiment and macro news. When a delta occurs between reality and signal input all hell breaks loose. All of which has nothing to do with the speed at which trades are submitted and executed.<p>A financial tax is laughable. That would truly impede market efficiency, a much better approach would be to mandate a minimum holding time of each order in the ELOB say 1000 micros before it can be amended or canceled.",1366804917

If I'm to believe that this is a technique, and not just a fortunate hiring for employee and employer, then there would need to be more examples of how this works, not just one.<p>From the content of the article alone it seems like finding a good employer might be a way of securing a good salary.

Either that or we need people who have seen the malaria epidemic to start blogging. Seriously, we have two communities that dont intersect with each other.<p>For me, one of the things I didn't realize is how steep the side effects for anti-malarials can be, or how short a time frame you can take them without destroying organs. I sort of took it for granted that we had solutions that allowed us to travel the planet, that it was just a ""well, poor people don't have access to our awesome first world drugs.""<p>It's... not like that.<p>I sometimes wondered as a sci fi loving kid what would happen if we were on multiple planets, could diseases and adaptations evolve so quickly that travel between human communities would be basically fatal?<p>The harrowing reality?

OR are going after a mass market with a better X OR need to get up the App Store charts (hit based apps)? THEN aim for a huge hard-launch. A big product launch in this case is pretty much mandatory.<p>IF you are not sure people will want it OR are searching for product/market fit THEN defer launch.<p>Always launch! Depending on the product/market sometimes you go big other times you fly low with a soft-launch.",1366804853

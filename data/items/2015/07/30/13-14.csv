But then it typically costs money to host any app, anywhere.<p>- The OSS alternatives to .NET are not better, not objectively. Some people prefer them, but that does not make them &quot;better&quot;.<p>But that&#x27;s sorta the point, isn&#x27;t it? I&#x27;ve done enough work in the Node and Rails and .NET ecosystems to have some small bit of perspective on the matter. I haven&#x27;t seen a server-side language that beats C#, at least presently. I haven&#x27;t seen a framework that is anywhere near as powerful as .NET anywhere in the world of OSS. And I haven&#x27;t seen ANY text editor that holds a candle to Visual Studio. I am pretty sure I&#x27;m coding circles around most of my OSS friends, well-intentioned as they are, and it&#x27;s mostly because of the tools I use.<p>There is SO MUCH VALUE in everybody on a team using a powerful, elegant, monolithic framework. There is also a lot of hostility towards Microsoft in our line of work, most of it deserved. But things change. And frankly, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time for anybody&#x27;s years-old grudges, not even my own. I don&#x27;t want to spend months of my life mastering Git while our billion-dollar clients are waiting impatiently for their apps. TFS is better and easier for our purposes, and a LOT of professional developers feel that way. Doesn&#x27;t mean we think anyone is wrong for using Sublime Text and terminal.

9974914,comment,9971888,9972815,0,0,duaneb,,,"> onfounding the processing of meaningless symbols (what computers can do) with actual sensory awareness of existence (what brains do).<p>I am highly dubious that the the qualitative nature of awareness when removed from symbols is of any value.<p>I have long ago accepted that I &quot;observe&quot; my brain—that is, my brain registers its own actions. At this point, understanding in the sense of the Chinese Room Experiment is mostly a question of &quot;how do you want to serialize these symbols?&quot;. The meaning is in the relations between symbols in that person (or computer&#x27;s) mind—mind-bogglingly complex, sure, but hardly non-serializable.<p>I find it very interesting that consciousness itself has had such a difficult time being hammered out. I have read quite a bit of philosophy on the subject (Searle&#x27;s publications among them), and it seems that there are fundamental disagreements over diction. I have had a very, very difficult time wrapping my head around the arguments for both &quot;free will&quot; as some kind of quantum effect (see: Penrose&#x27;s The Emperor&#x27;s New Mind and its &quot;sequel&quot;) and arguments for some specially defined consciousness with requirements for &quot;awareness&quot;. Think about a dolphin: it&#x27;s fairly easy to imagine what it might be aware of, although the particulars are obviously unreachable because our brains are not wired to be aware of the same sensors of which a dolphin brain is aware. That&#x27;s the practical limit, though, in terms of having difficulty grasping what a dolphin might experience—you might have the same difficulty understanding how a blind-from-birth person is aware of the world because you can&#x27;t cancel out your own visual wiring. This isn&#x27;t really a barrier in terms of having the same ability as a blind person (or vice versa) except where that sensory awarenesses is critical.<p>Now, in terms of meaning, talk to people with abnormal thought patterns—schizophrenics, bi-polar people, borderline personality people, OCD people. For instance, many with severe personality disorders have a tendency to dichotomize everything with difficulty integrating &quot;shades of grey&quot; into every day thinking. Others—e.g. some compulsive liars—have a very difficult time pinning down specific meanings from an objective standpoint. Compartmentalization is a mechanism allowing multiple truths in compartments while allowing contradictions in a general sense. Meaning is evidently subjective. Which is more &quot;meaningful&quot; to you, attempting to understand the mapping of incomprehensible numbers of physical neurons, or attempting to understand the mapping of incomprehensible numbers of non-linear equations? They both come out to about the same level of &quot;meaningless symbol&quot; processing with no &quot;magic&quot; to me.<p>The structure of models of current neural networks are very, very rudimentary now, and are probably dozens of orders of magnitudes less complex than those of the human brain. But current research—including analyzing the brain, understanding how to describe it in terms of current understanding of neural networks, serializing it to a model, and simulating the model—are even now, within reach of being able to simulate a nematode brain. At that point, the arguments over consciousness merge for &quot;how big/smart/aware/whatever does a brain need to be to be conscious&quot; and &quot;do we have strong AI&quot;? It becomes a game of &quot;is this particular instance of AI closer topologically to something we have qualitatively shown to be useful as a strong AI contender via something like the chinese room experiment (I&#x27;m pretty sure a lot of humans would fail a chinese room experiment because we can be really dumb, so we can compare/contrast against a human success rate), or to something we modeled after biological research.<p>Consciousness is nothing special anymore. The magic is modeling the facets of awareness you find fascinating or unique, in any language you want. If you don&#x27;t <i>think</i> you can model it, try to articulate what quality you would have difficulty modeling. I suspect I would have difficulty understanding the quality in my own experience.",1438264145

I still think that asking candidates to spend, say, 5-7 hours on something is a big deal, even if you give them a choice to take a different path.<p>I&#x27;m not inherently opposed to technical tests, either in person or take home exams.  I believe that many exam-based institutions adhere to a code (probably unwritten) that grants certain rights to the examinee.  Think about exams in college, where stakes can actually be quite high.<p>Think about exams at a university.  Typically the subject matter and nature of exam questions is available in advance.  The grader is highly competent in the field.  An associated study path is available for the exam.  The exam will be graded and scored, and those scores will be communicated to the student within a set time frame.  Feedback will be provided to the student.  The exam is part of achieving a lasting credential, such as credit for a course on a transcript.<p>None of these things exist in technical exams, and in many ways, this increases the stress.  Merely making an exam &quot;optional&quot; doesn&#x27;t erase all these problems.  I think this is the core problem with technical exams, they contain all of the stress for the student, but have none of those rights that I believe exist in universities and other exam-based institutions for a good reason.",1438264128

It&#x27;s Is suspiciously similar to what you would expect from a measurement error due to thermal effects.<p>The only comment in the HN submission is mine, and I&#x27;ll copy it (with a few modifications) because it&#x27;s (more) relevant here.<p>Some numbers to compare:<p>The German experiment got 20uN with a 700W magneton, that is 20uN/700W = 0.03 mN/KW. (Probably some energy is &quot;lost&quot; and the &quot;real&quot; efficiency is higher, but when you claim to break the physics law the measurements must be foolproof.)<p>The maximal theoretical output of a device that don&#x27;t break the currently accepted physics laws is 1/c = 0.0033 mN/KW. So the German measurement is 10x bigger than the theoretical maximum.<p>The 18-month-to-Pluto and 4-hous-to-Moon calculation use 0.4 N/KW = 400 mN/KW, that is approximately one half of the maximum claim of any of this device family, but most experiments get much smaller results. The 0.4 N/KW is 130,000x bigger than the theoretical maximum and 13,000x bigger than what they got in the German experiment. So if a device with the same output of this experiment, the trip to Pluto or the Moon will be much longer.<p>(Disclaimer: Just to be clear, I think this is only an experimental error.)",1438261962

I&#x27;d say that the analogy makes no sense. Whatever you can &quot;emulate&quot;, you&#x27;re emulating because you&#x27;ve got the &quot;hardware&quot; to do it.<p>To illustrate my point: we can&#x27;t emulate perceiving time at a much slower pace or viewing a wider spectrum of light. Okay, that&#x27;s a wrong example since we&#x27;re limited by our eyes - the peripherals/sensing devices. Perhaps try emulating interpreting visible light as a color blind person would.<p>The separation between hardware (brain) and software (soul?) is practically non-existent.

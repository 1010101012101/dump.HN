(Factories use robots that are custom programmed with vision for each application and don't really do recongition in the sense of object recognition in an arbitray scene). Recognizing common household objects would be useful for a company building home robots (of which there are a few) right now.<p>There is a recent startup doing image recognition using humans, on photos at flickr.<p>Search engines relied on letting a single algorithm go out and process data. There isn't yet an artificial intelligence algorithm that can just go out and do what it needs (unsupervised learning algorithm that works well). The currently available algorithms (supervised learning) require labelled data, and since there are millions of categories of things (that we as humans can percieve and so are useful to recognize), it would require at least a billion labellings of the data (1000 data labellings for each category).<p>The trouble with companies and groups engineers is that you would have to fund them, organize etc. and only a few groups would form (there are only an handful of video analytics companies probably, all of them probably do recognition of a handful of the same things).\nBesides, the system advocated above is pretty simple, hardly any engineering in the sense of specialized technical skill is required. You would just collect and feed data into the classifiers. Others would combine data from classifers into yet more classifiers.",1218249132

Related and also important is motivation.<p>Excelling at the classroom model might provide a foundational excitement or make talking with natives less humiliating or help with grammatical minutiae (in German, irregular verb stems and modifier declension, which just take more hours to get intuitively), but has nothing directly to do with how fluent you end up.<p>I’d guess this test serves more to reinforce an already prevalent, toxic fatalism about learning languages (in particular as adults) than to teach us about our selves.",1397850838

There are millions of DHCP servers etc.  The exception is DNS, which was a centralized replacement for the original decentralized mechanism of hosts files - an understandable decision as software techniques for decentralized consensus were unknown at the time. Fortunately we can now correct this, with Namecoin or similar.<p>>All the devices on the internet would be constantly communicating, trying to find consensus, trying to update routes, trying to search distributed rings (my personal favorite topology) to find peers, connect services, authenticate trust relationships, query data, update indexes<p>You seem to have a very detailed idea of how a &quot;decentralized&quot; internet would work at the technical level. Sounds like you&#x27;re describing a global meshnet, as imagined today. Obviously we do not currently have the tools to develop an efficient global meshnet. However, just because you cannot personally imagine one doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t possible.<p>>FDIC-insured bank<p>Must have missed something - what&#x27;s Facebook&#x27;s FDIC equivalent? I wasn&#x27;t aware that <i>cough</i>cloud<i>cough</i> services had a regulatory body that would compensate me if they failed to do their job.<p>>It&#x27;s just a really dangerous idea to put data you care about in a place that&#x27;s easily available to thieves<p>I agree. How exactly is a hard drive in my basement more accessible to thieves than a data center (a much juicier target) run by people of unknown competence and ethics? Of course, if you&#x27;re paranoid about your house burning down, there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from putting an encrypted, uuencoded zip of your files on pastebin.<p>>the very idea of decentralized services is contrary to high-availability data<p>Bittorrent: Faster, cheaper, and more robust than a central server.<p>>we put a man on the moon with centralized services<p>Really? I thought we did it by funding a whole bunch of aerospace companies to design and build different pieces. Sounds pretty decentralized. &quot;But the funding came from the government!&quot; The funding came from taxes, which came from millions of people, who would not have had that money were it not for the economy! Now there&#x27;s a whopping great decentralized system for you. Shall we switch to a planned economy? Would that be more efficient?<p>The best way to make a system do what you want is design its ground rules from the get-go such that it self-organizes that way.",1397850282

Nobody was more surprised than I was.<p>Then, after spending a few years teaching English as a foreign language, I realized a few things.<p>First of all, pretty much anybody can pick up a new language, since pretty much everyone speaks a native tongue. Learning a second language really isn&#x27;t any different. I was shocked at how natural it felt, picking up Portuguese -- I just felt like I was 3 years old again.<p>But second, unless you move to a foreign country and spend all day in the language, very few people have the time or exposure to learn a second language this way. It&#x27;s just not realistic.<p>So third, this is why traditional language-learning classes fail for most people, because the teaching style bears so little resemblance to the natural way our brain picks up language. (This is not a criticism, it&#x27;s just the reality of what you can do with a very limited amount of time and the classroom format -- and believe me, I know!)<p>But fourth, a few students thrive in the classroom format and pick up the language anyway. I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s necessarily that they have better innate language aptitude -- they just seem to be the lucky few who are more compatible with the classroom format.<p>So I wonder, is the test described in this article identifying people who are actually better at learning languages &quot;naturally&quot;, or people who are better at learning them in the very different environment of the language-learning classroom?",1397849187

I have seen this transition first-hand. I grew up in a multi-generation home with my grandparents and parents sharing the same space. I have left at 19 to another city, but some of my family members have stayed and there are four generations living in the house right now. My parents share a floor with my mother&#x27;s dad, my father&#x27;s mom and my brother (in his twenties). On another floor lives my mom&#x27;s sister with her family (husband, daughter and daughter&#x27;s children). Houses built to accommodate two or three generations were common even 30 years ago. Many people, especially in small towns and villages have built huge houses with the assumption that each of their kids will stay there and needs a floor of their own. Then, suddenly, so many things have changed. We can - or have to - work abroad, or move halfway across the country to study and then find a job. Many of those large houses are so sad right now with just a couple of elder people using two rooms and the kitchen with hundreds of square meters of empty space, sometimes filled with stuff left behind by their children who can&#x27;t take it all with them to their studio apartments.<p>I don&#x27;t know of anyone from my generation who would event think of building a house with their future kids and grandchildren in mind.

But that&#x27;s also a ridiculously reductionist view that neglects the layers and layers of complexity that overlays that. For example, if you were able to create a situation where a person&#x27;s diet and exercise levels could be exactly controlled, then yes, we can control a person&#x27;s weight from first principles, relying only on conservation of energy. But that&#x27;s not a realistic situation.<p>b) Just &quot;cutting your carbs&quot; is probably a reasonable piece of advice on an individual scale, and probably a reasonable thing for a person who is worried about their weight/health to attempt. But as the article points out, the carb increase is systemic, and while its certainly possible to address systemic problems from a purely ground-up, individual basis, it&#x27;s certainly easier to tackle the issue from as many perspectives as possible.<p>c) Just &quot;cutting out the processed foods&quot; is exactly the same as above<p>d) Just &quot;try <insert name> diet&quot; is once again probably the same as above, with the added bonus that nearly any diet is probably going to work and generate short-medium term results just by shocking the body, and forcing some level of structured discipline on an individual, especially discipline laced with all the extra goodies of being from &quot;experts&quot; and all the other fun social stuff we work in.<p>e) Natural obviously does not mean &#x27;better&#x27;. However, it&#x27;s clear that we have adapted for a certain environment, and while we certainly don&#x27;t need to replicate that environment in it&#x27;s totality, that does not imply that our current environment is any good at all from any number of perspectives.<p>f) This does mean that &#x27;paleo&#x27;, especially the way the that the paleo-diet/lifestyle is marketed is the way to go. Really all we got to go on is that our macronutrient ratio is out of whack. That does not mean that if you&#x27;re doing paleo, or are considering paleo that you&#x27;re doing shit wrong.

7610756,comment,7610260,7610602,6,0,ckinsey,,,"Good points.<p>First off, thanks for checking out the site.  You are absolutely correct that full-stack engineers are _not_ needed at organizations of every size and structure.  They are, in my experience, in the highest demand in any organization that has a small to medium size technical team.  The reality is that many teams of this size exist--there are far more small teams than their are large ones in the workforce.  I come from a background in news media, specifically newspapers.  Let me tell you that EVERY news organization, even at the local level, needs full stack developers.  Almost none of them need, for example, an Angular.js specialist.<p>Larger organizations, especially proper software companies, can afford to diversify their workforce into highly focused and manageable skillets.  But, that does not mean there is no place for the full stack engineer in these companies.  Positions like Operations Managers, Data Architects, Heads of Technology, Directors of Application Development and even some Project Managers are filled very well by candidates with full stack engineering backgrounds.<p>So its important to note that these positions do exist in organizations of all sizes and in many cases, they are a fast moving career path into management.  I do recommend this path post grad--I&#x27;ve been working as a full stack developer for nearly a decade, and the biggest struggle I&#x27;ve had is having to turn down work.  That&#x27;s exactly why I started this project, because I have more jobs coming across my desk than I can apply for.<p>In my personal experience recently as Head of Technology for a startup company, conveyance of skills really was a big challenge for us.  We needed highly capable engineers, and headhunters were throwing us lots of unqualified talent.  That&#x27;s a tough pill to swallow when you are paying many thousands of dollars just to _search_ for talent on a startup&#x27;s budget.  I felt that had I been given some very quality insight into the skills of the talent pool, I could have done a much better job of vetting the candidates myself for our specific needs--another concept that pushed me to start this project!<p>-Casey",1397848451

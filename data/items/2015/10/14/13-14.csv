Livery cabs are not allowed to accept street hails, but are allowed to be ordered for pick up in other ways (such as through a phone call).

While the American revolution and American Civil War is well known[1], the British Civil War and the Glorious Revolution are probably not given the attention they deserve. If you look closely at history, you can see similar patterns: despotic monarchs run out of money, give more power to the nobles in return for taxation rights. Nobles use their new power to restrict the absolute powers of the monarch and then the monarch and nobles struggle. Britain was the one country where the nobles were successful in restricting the absolute power of the monarch and continued the tradition of sharing power, bringing democracy to Western Europe after a long time.<p>Anyway, that was completely off topic. I agree that the British Empire, while most certainly not the most moral or fair, cannot be characterized as despotic.<p>[1]: Perhaps I hear more about it because I currently live in the US.

10386562,comment,10382919,10382919,0,0,mazelife,,,"I have very mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, it&#x27;s great to see a younger and/or less-traditional audience attending symphony concerts. But I wonder what percentage of these first-timers would ever come back for a non-videogame music performance? Because—the title of this article notwithstanding—if these concerts don&#x27;t do anything to cultivate an audience who actually engages with classical music (or &quot;art music&quot; or &quot;western concert music&quot;, call it what you like) then videogames are not going to save the symphony. Not even close.<p>People in the comments rightly jumped all over the guy in the article who said these concerts were “akin to Mouton Rothschild using its wine to make and sell sangria.” But there is a point buried under all the snobbishness: video game music (and film music) are not supposed to be concert music. In fact a good film composer would probably tell you that if their score for a film is so compelling and interesting that it can be extracted out and plunked down in the concert hall as a fully-fledged work, they&#x27;re doing it wrong. Film/videogame scores are (by definition) supposed to be subservient to the whole of which they are a part. Thus it&#x27;s the narrative of the game or movie that drives the formal aspects of the music. This isn&#x27;t to say that there can&#x27;t be greatness and even genius in scores, but that it&#x27;s not being used in service of producing a stand-alone concert work. Which is why even very good scores usually have long passages of music that successfully create an atmosphere for a particular scene, but taken out of that context would sounds rather boring and aimless in a concert hall. Similarly the kind of drama evoked in a concert piece where you have musical themes that are presented and then developed and transformed at length just doesn&#x27;t work for film scores, where you are working in much shorter time increments (like the length of a scene). This is why even the greatest film scores (Maurice Jarre&#x27;s score for Lawrence of Arabia and John Williams&#x27; score for Star Wars, for example) are known for having a few really memorable, resonant melodies and/or for the way in which they contribute to a memorable scene.<p>I&#x27;ve gone to film music concerts and enjoyed them, but I&#x27;m under no illusion that it&#x27;s necessarily the most challenging or profound stuff. I&#x27;m also aware that it&#x27;s partly the memories and associations  I have with the movies themselves that I am enjoying when I listen to the music. In any case, it&#x27;s not at all the same experience as a classical music concert. I hope that some of the people who have dipped their toes in the water listening to an orchestra perform &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; might be curious enough to go back and hear what other, far more interesting kinds of things an orchestra can do. Because if not, these concerts will be a nice windfall that can help pad an orchestra&#x27;s bottom line (and god knows they could use the money). But they won&#x27;t do what orchestras need most, which is to develop a real, life-long appreciation for classical music in younger audiences. Unfortunately this article presents zero statistics one way or the other on that point.",1444830529

It&#x27;s not a bad language, and yes, the plotting is currently second-to-none, at least based on my limited experience with matplotlib and seaborn.<p>There&#x27;s scant few articles on going from Python to R...and I think that has given me a lot of reason to hesitate. One of the big assets of R is Hadley Wickham...the amount and variety of work he has contributed is prodigious (not just ggplot2, but everything from data cleaning, web scraping, dev tools, time-handling a la moment.js, and books). But that&#x27;s not just evidence of how generous and talented Wickham is, but how relatively little dev support there is in R. If something breaks in ggplot2 -- or any of the many libraries he&#x27;s involved in, he&#x27;s often the one to respond to the ticket. He&#x27;s only one person. There are many talented developers in R but it&#x27;s not quite a deep open-source ecosystem and community yet.<p>Also word-of-warning: ggplot2 (as of 2014[1]) is in maintenance mode and Wickham is focused on ggvis, which will be a web visualization library. I don&#x27;t know if there has been much talk about non-Hadley-Wickham people taking over ggplot2 and expanding it...it seems more that people are content to follow him into ggvis, even though a static viz library is still very valuable.<p>[1] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ggplot2/SSxt8B8QLfo/discussion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ggplot2/SSxt8B8QLfo/...</a>",1444830479

(Also, if you actually look at the parts HTML 4 that required anyone to do anything, you end up with things like dbaron&#x27;s table (as in, a desk) implementation of it: put quotations mark at either end of the table, and whatever HTML you put on the table, it has fulfilled all the requirements of the standard.)<p>But yes, the underlying problem of different approaches is a large part of the reason why you want multiple implementations — the other large part is you want <i>evidence</i> the standard is clear enough to lead to interoperable implementations. These are the two big reasons the W3C now require evidence of two, distinct, interoperable implementations of a specification to proceed down the Recommendation track beyond Candidate Recommendation (i.e., to Proposed Recommendation)… and this is the reason why so much around the W3C takes so long, because people by and large don&#x27;t want to fix ancient, obscure bugs which are often time-consuming to fix for the sake of the standard progressing.",1444830374

That way, if you ever upgrade your store, you just have to refactor those queries but your app code remains the same. On top of that, in your unit tests you can pass in a mimicking test double for your store to do a true unit test, and avoid retesting your store over and over again wastefully.

One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops, and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It&#x27;s a little bit off because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It&#x27;s interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of an electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bit bigger than Millikan&#x27;s, and the next one&#x27;s a little bit bigger than that, and the next one&#x27;s a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.<p>Why didn&#x27;t they discover the new number was higher right away? It&#x27;s a thing that scientists are ashamed of—this history—because it&#x27;s apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan&#x27;s, they thought something must be wrong—and they would look for and find a reason why something might be wrong.

Anyway it happens all the time, most companies sell or buy B2B with 30-60 day payments, and many companies with cashflow issues will sell those future payments for money today.

Prediction of aliasing is discussed on slide 25.<p>The patent in question pertains to an optimization of what these days you&#x27;d call &quot;memory disambiguation.&quot; In a processor executing instructions out of order, data dependencies can be known or ambiguous. A known data dependency is, for example, summing the results of two previous instructions that themselves each compute the product of two values. An ambiguous data dependency is usually a memory read after a memory write. The processor usually does not know the address of the store until it executes the store. So it can&#x27;t tell whether a subsequent load must wait behind the store (if it reads from the same address), or can safely be moved ahead of it (if it reads from a different address).<p>If you have the appropriate machinery, you can speculatively execute that later load instruction. But you need some mechanism to ensure that if you guess wrong--that subsequent load really does read from the same address as the earlier store--you can roll back the pipeline and re execute things in the correct order.<p>But flushing that work and replaying is slow. If you&#x27;ve got a dependent store-load pair, you want to avoid the situation where misspeculation causes you to have to flush and reply every time. The insight of the patent is that these dependent store-load pairs have temporal locality. Using a small table, you can avoid most misspeculations by tracking these pairs in the table and not speculating the subsequent load if you get a table hit. That specific use of a prediction table is what is claimed by the patent.<p>Maybe this is worth a patent, or maybe not. For what it&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t think anybody was doing memory disambiguation at all in 1996. Intel was one of the first (maybe the first) to do so commercially in the mid-2000&#x27;s. Apple&#x27;s Cyclone architecture also does it, and I think it was the first in the low-power SoC space to do it.",1444828420

There is the exact same problem in bittorrent space: there&#x27;s a BEP (extension) for discovering peers using Zeroconf (BEP 0026, as can be read in [1]) and &quot;Local Peer Discovery&quot; that doesn&#x27;t even have a BEP.<p>The Zeroconf way is kind of cumbersome, especially if you don&#x27;t have an easy way to do the whole mDNS and DNS-SD. And since Windows doesn&#x27;t have a native way to do this (you need to use the Apple SDK) and it seems most bittorrent users are Windows users, nobody seriously bothered with that.<p>LPD on the other hand is the simplest thing you can ever think about (<a href=""https://forum.utorrent.com/topic/54306-local-peer-discovery-documentation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forum.utorrent.com/topic/54306-local-peer-discovery-...</a>):<p>> in short: join the multicast group 239.192.152.143:6771 and listen for SSDP messages. Every 5 minutes, announce yourself to the multicast group by sending this message:<p>> snprintf(msg, 200,\n&quot;BT-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1\r\n&quot;\n&quot;Host: 239.192.152.143:6771\r\n&quot;\n&quot;Port: %d\r\n&quot;\n&quot;Infohash: %s\r\n&quot;\n&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;, listen_port, ih_hex);<p>I&#x27;ll agree with you that if everyone talked Zeroconf it would be great, but the truth is, it&#x27;s far too heavy and difficult compared to the alternative of polling a simple UDP socket, which pretty much any language can do easily.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0026.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0026.html</a>",1444827885

If Mnesia turns out not to fit your problem, here in 2015, you&#x27;ve got literally <i>dozens</i> of choices of alternate DB, with all sorts of consistency and distributibility and performance characteristics.<p>My guess is that if somehow Erlang was where it was in 2015 except it didn&#x27;t have Mnesia, nobody would really perceive much of a hole there, and nobody would write it, because of the database explosion we&#x27;ve seen in the past 10 years. But it is there, and if it works for you, go for it.<p>My only slight suggestion is that rather than inlining all your mnesia calls, you ought to isolate them into a separate module or modules or something with an interface. But, that&#x27;s not really because of Mnesia... I tend to recommend that anyhow. In pattern terms, I pretty much <i>always</i> recommend wrapping a Facade around your data store access, if for no other reason than how easy it makes your testing if you can drop in alternate implementations. And then, if mnesia... no, wait... And then, if $DATABASE turns out to be unsuitable, you&#x27;re not stuck up a creek without a paddle.

7171758,comment,7170560,7171632,7,0,gabemart,,,"It&#x27;s not impossible, but it can be extremely difficult.<p>Consider a short story published in a literary journal last week. Allow a copyright system to exist that covers each eligible work for 30 years by default, and allows multiple extensions of 5 years at a cost of $1000 per extension per work, up to a total copyright term of 100 years.<p>Someone in 2047 discovers a copy of this particular journal issue, which has now become obscure. They identify that this short story, though never being given acclaim, has had a subtle yet profound cultural influence. They decide to republish the story in their own commercial magazine, but want to check if the copyright has been extended. If it has not, the story is in the public domain. If is has been extended, the story is still covered by copyright.<p>They can search the central registry for the title of the short story and the name of the author. But they also have to search for the names of the editors of the journal, because it isn&#x27;t clear whether or not the copyright stayed with the author or was transferred to the journal as part of the submission process. In fact, the copyright might have been granted to the owner of the journal, which may be an individual or may be an institution. The entry for the copyright might be under the title of the short story, or under the title for the journal, or under the title of that particular issue of the journal.<p>Furthermore, the author of the story, if they retained the copyright, may have submitted the story under a pen name, and/or may have registered the copyright of the short story under a different title than the title they used to submit to the journal, or the title might have been changed by the editors.<p>Or, the author, after having the short story accepted by the journal, may have sold it to a publisher who published it in a short fiction anthology, the copyright for which is registered completely separately and is essentially invisible to our hypothetical future researcher.<p>Any of these agents might have extended the copyright. It would be extremely difficult to prove to a high degree of certainty that the story was or was not covered by copyright.",1391446639

In one of his last letters to his lawyer he tells him: &#x27;Do whatever you wish to do, the issue [of my defence] is over&#x27;, and includes with it a message of farewell written both to him personally as well to the world at large: &#x27;With all my pains, I say goodbye to you and the cry of death should be enough for you. A world power failed to safeguard peace and human rights and from saving me. I will do whatever I am able to do to rid myself of the imposed death on me at any moment of this prison... the soul that insists to end it all and leave this life which is no longer anymore a life&#x27;&quot;.<p>Josef K thought the law was accessible and would protect him, because he was innocent--so there is nothing to fear, right? Wrong. The excerpt from above is taken from a central piece of The Trial--the parable &quot;Before the Law&quot;, which was a conversation Josef K had with the priest.<p>Franz Kafka studied law. He thought it was made to confuse the layman and that the law was not blind and balanced, as the statue so famously demonstrates, but rather has wings and shifts.<p>Though The Trial is a work of fiction and Latif is a real man, when I first read this book, it helped me realise and gain more compassion towards those who have been treated unfairly by the law.",1391445474

Currently, anything published in the United States prior to 1923 is in the public domain in the United States [1][2]. Some works published after 1923 are also in the public domain if they meet certain conditions (e.g. a work published in 1925 with a copyright notice where the copyright was never renewed), but it can be an extreme headache to work out which post-1923 works are in copyright and which are not.<p>Although I am in no way a fan of the current system, it at least has the advantage of clarity for pre-1923 works.<p>In a proposed system of copyright extension, renewal or terms that are in other ways modifiable on a per-work basis, establishing whether or not works are still in copyright would become an absolute <i>nightmare</i>. Consider that, in the US, copyright applies to any eligible creative work at the moment it is &quot;created and fixed in a tangible form&quot; [3]. In the internet age, millions or billions or works are created each day that are protected by copyright. Most of these works do not have a title and will never be registered anywhere, but copyright applies none the less. A central registry of copyrighted works is impossible, much less a registry that records the specific extensions or renewal term on a per-work basis.<p>In my opinion, the only possible system that can work is one based on fixed lengths of time. If copyright is extendable, the large majority of works will fall into a legal grey area where it is unclear whether or not the copyright has been extended and almost impossible to find out. Under such a system, the only safe approach to handling copyrighted works would be to assume each work had had its copyright extended to the maximum term possible under law, unless it was provable that was not the case (which, as I have argued, would be extremely difficult).<p>Under a fixed-term system, it is simple to work out whether or not most works are still copyrighted, even in cases where the title, author of record or copyright holder are not identifiable.<p>[1] There may be some obscure exceptions to this rule, but it holds broadly enough that I have never encountered any in practice.<p>[2] <a href=""http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html</a>",1391445472

The dishes themselves are not in and of themselves important. In the case of the streetlight, many people may be too busy navigating the streets to relax properly into a good idle state, or they may be pissed off and want some light-hearted fun; we should not make value judgments on them for that.<p>> it [is] important to unplug from technology on a regular basis<p>Whilst I might not necessarily disagree with you on this point, people often make this claim with no actual evidence or reasoning. <i>Why</i> is it important to unplug? In some situations, I can clearly see a benefit - for example, eating dinner with friends, pulling out a phone to check social media disrupts your ability to connect with your friends, makes you seem rude, and will likely reduce the quality of your interaction. When I&#x27;m on the train to work in the morning, listening to music and reading web articles on my phone seems like a net benefit.<p>There can be benefits to avoiding technology and to doing things properly and in-person - but those should be evaluated on an individual basis with logic, rather than with a general appeal to puritan work-ethics and ascetism.",1391445310

I was banned from adsense for &quot;manipulating ads&quot; or some such thing. I of course had never done this, and had actually put a LOT of effort into making sure that there was no way I could be flagged for click fraud. I actively told any family or friends that knew about my project to NEVER click on an ad on my site. It just wasn&#x27;t worth the risk of getting banned from adsense, since most other networks pay significantly less for significantly more headaches. I had a high traffic site that was bringing in a lot of money without any need to cheat (so why risk everything for a few bucks?).<p>Well I ended up getting banned regardless for who knows why, maybe someone had it out for me and committed click fraud on the site through a bunch of proxy servers, I have no idea. Google refused to give me any information whatsoever. They did allow me to &quot;appeal&quot; to them, but it was clear in their automated response that no human read my appeal.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;ll never trust Google again for anything business critical. By which I mean any project that relies heavily on Google in some way is very high risk. If something goes wrong (ie they shut down a service you rely on etc) they won&#x27;t care to work with you in the slightest (unless you already have SV connections like rap genius).<p>On a side note, I did have a Google sales team reach out and contact me about a year later asking if I wanted to get involved in some new ad product they were working on. It was quite a slap in the face when I had to tell <i>them</i> that I was actually banned from adsense. Of course they responded by telling me there was nothing they could do to help overturn my ban.

Crap, there&#x27;s a race condition; is the thread going to push the next thing this item needs in time for the pop? Well, maybe change it, the thread handles all the remaining action items for that job? But what if it&#x27;s long lived, how does my thread pool look, will we exhaust the pool?

They don&#x27;t need Bootstrap, Knockout, Rails or ORMs. In fact, these frameworks are demonstrable bad due to:<p>1. They remove functionality (developmental power) from their underlying technologies in exchange for making a few types of features slightly easier.\n2. Their abstractions are leaky - they cannot be used to their fullest potential without also understanding their underlying technologies.\n3. They add overhead to a project both in optimal performance and technical debt.<p>So why does everyone flock to frameworks?

One is &quot;Learning how something really works and understanding the core&quot; and the other is &quot;Creating production ready applications with a tested abstract magical tool&quot;. Frameworks are great to create production ready apps in no time even for a novice. But on the other hand, they have too much magic at times. Take for example, this code in Python/Django:<p><pre><code>    user = User.objects.create_user(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;email&#x27;, &#x27;pwd&#x27;)\n    user.save()\n</code></pre>\nIn 2 lines of magical code, we are able to create a user object and make sure we are able to save it in the database without worrying about a lot of things. This is great for rapid app building. But what is really happening behind the scenes ? Do you really understand the flow for user.save(). How would you do it without this abstraction ? If you don&#x27;t understand the core, you will never be able to become a great developer.<p>So my advice overall is to learn the core by writing stuff from scratch as much as possible and really understand how things work. Then, pick a framework and do the same. So even though you will write crappy bad quality code, you don&#x27;t need to release that in production. Win-Win here.",1391443391

250447,comment,249658,250205,0,0,randombit,,,"I'm not sure about the derivatives market part, but remember that (in the US, at least) most student loans are administered by the federal government, and are 'guaranteed' by them. That means if you don't pay up, the government will fuck with you in all the various ways a government can (confiscation of tax refunds, wage garnishment, etc - and don't forget student loans are not covered by bankruptcy). That is why my loan interest is less than 2% over the fed funds rate - it's worth it to loan money at that rate, because there is effectively no way to avoid having to pay up, short of dying.",1216436171

Suddenly just because some humans have the ability and capacity to provide something that others want, they are now entitled to it? That is a pretty bold claim that I think needs justification. I'm not saying I disagree, just that when you are suggesting that someone must do something, you provide your reasoning.",1216435521

If MS didn't want to do it when their stock price was over $30 why would they do it now when they are under $26.

250436,comment,250388,250388,0,0,Zev,,,"Maybe it's just me, but it doesn't make any sense to use Bittorrent to stream videos.  One of the strengths of Bittorrent is that you don't download everything sequentially (which makes sense to do if you're streaming audio and/or video). It's broken up into pieces that can be sent randomly to many users who then redistribute the data.<p>Sure, there's Initial Seeding (spec: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/6y2ng2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/6y2ng2</a> ) which sends data sequentially. But that refuses to send data to a peer until that peer has already sent its data out to everyone else. There's also HTTP-based seeding (spec: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/p5kpn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/p5kpn</a> ) but the implementations - or attempted implementations - that I'm aware of don't exactly work well.",1216435024

The sandboxing and unloading are legitimate issues, but have nothing to do with the language.<p>I wouldn't necessarily be against a wholly different language for use in the timeline, as I prefer not to put code there anyway, assuming I have to use those ugly Movieclips at all. I could see something terse and elegant, eschewing the AS2 prototype nastiness, being useful for animators and light programmers alike. I think the biggest barrier for most is the new event model. Adding listeners is a bit verbose for those used to simply overriding an on() method.",1216434703

At the very least, you can notify someone to change their password because their account has been compromised.  You know _who_ is responsible for the request because it was authenticated.<p>In other words, your EULA/terms-of-service is a long the lines of ""you are responsible for the user of this service using your login credentials, which can be revoked at any time if we perceive you to be violating the terms of service"".  Then becomes a little more manageable as a social problem (which it is), rather than solely relying on a technical solution to a social problem.",1216432830

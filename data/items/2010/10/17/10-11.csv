It's the best algorithm known to people who took any course in number theory or a higher level computer science course that covered approximation algorithms.  This is used in actual applications like crypto (RSA) frequently.<p>It is exactly like asking an applicant to sort an array and expecting the naive bubble sort response to check they can develop and implement a naive algorithm for searching.  It says you can brute force a solution with a for loop.  It says nothing about how well you understand advanced data structures, recursion, algorithmic analysis, language features, domain specific knowledge, program design and structure, or knowing when you you're out of your league and should google the best approach. It quizzes chapter 3 of any intro programming book and basic division in a situation where you would never use it.<p>Ask them about event handling or something useful like hash tables or linked lists or version control systems.  Any math major can answer this question easily without knowing much beyond for loops and arrays.  It tells you almost nothing about their programming skills.  I was math/cs with grad school in math and every math major I know could do this.  Most of them have no idea how to code.

Computer science is not about computers; Just like astronomy is not about telescopes (Dijkstra).<p>The only thing that really matter about computers is that they are communicating Turing-complete machines.  Every communicating Turing-complete hardware on the planet is therefore the same, modulo the necessary emulation layer (performance is becoming secondary, so let's pretend it's not a problem).<p>What we want as humans is communicating Turing-complete machines that are easy to use.  That's a fact about us, not about hardware.  Therefore, OS APIs should depend on <i>us</i>, not on hardware.

To give an example, the time you spend reading this email might be a completely wasted effort, or even a mostly wasted effort, but with some degree of luck and skill, I <i>might</i> manage to make the time you spend worthwhile.  Essentially, the words I'm writing <i>might</i> have value to you.<p>In a world where writing something is extremely easy, the overwhelming majority of written text has little or no value. The invention of text editors, desktop publishing, printers, and all associated technology has vastly increased the volume of written text, but at the same time it has decreased the value of written text. It's a signal to noise problem, since when any idiot can write, many do (myself included).<p>Please don't fall into the trap of believing ""reviews"" (or karma for that matter) will be an adequate filter. There will always be a risk/reward ratio for time invested in reading, and for something to be ranked poorly, someone had to waste their time reading it.<p>There are really only two primary motivations for writing, fame and fortune. The minor motivations such as sharing and contributing thoughts or efforts are often entangled with the primary motivations. This goes back to the pessimistic view of, ""There's no such thing as a selfless act,"" but rationally, it is applicable.<p>For the sake of argument, imagine the end of copyright, and hence the end of books as we know them. More accurately, we're looking at the end of the financial motivations to write, edit, and publish books in any form. With fortune now missing from the rather short list of primary motivations, all we have left is fame. Since one can profit from fame, financial motivations have not been completely removed.<p>When you boil it down, no matter how ""useful"" written content may be, it is still a form of advertising.<p>When you want to hire someone for a programming position, you look at their advertisements, such as open source contributions.<p>When you want to be entertained, ...<p>When you want to be informed, ...<p>Assuming you've read a book (advertisement) by J.K. Rowling, and enjoyed it, would you be willing to pay to see her read/tell a new story to an audience?<p>Assuming you've read a book (advertisement) by Lawrence (Larry) Harris on ""Trading & Exchanges,"" and found it useful/enjoyable, would you be willing to pay to attend one of his classes or lectures?

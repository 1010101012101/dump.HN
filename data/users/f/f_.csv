For us, they were not only innovators, but also collaborators and thinkers – you can’t argue with that. We’re here to revive that very same atmosphere, bringing french touch talent to light. The French Shuffle is a music blog dedicated to all things french house, electro, disco, and funk.\n\n     Currently, the blog exists as a liaison between musicians and their respective listeners, keeping the audience up-to-date on artists, events, interviews, news, and more.

fluffyjack,,5,0.0,6,2,"Twitter: @FluffyJack\nLinkedIn: http://lnkd.in/A_Qq5q<p>I was one of those kids that always pulled apart my toys instead of playing with them because I was way more interested in how they worked, and so when my family got a computer when I was about 7 or 8, I managed to convince my father to pull it apart with me and learn about all the pieces.<p>Then we got the internet, this was around the time I was turning 10. An amazing thing but nothing for me to pull apart, so I did the next best thing, I learnt how to build more of it myself. I searched and searched and learnt everything I could.<p>One day I&#x27;d reached a level where even though I was 12, I was able to go and get a professional job, for real money (very exciting at 12), creating and maintaining websites for a local studio that did websites for companies all over the world. I was hooked.<p>Around 14-15 I managed to enter a program at school where I could go work and complete a traineeship instead of participate in all of my classes. So I was introduced to Yari from Evolved Websites, and I started my traineeship. I learnt so much over the 19 months there, not just in terms of my technical skills, but my business skills also. The traineeship was a huge success too. Though the normal completion time was 24 months, I managed to fast-track the course side and complete it in 6 months.<p>Then I was on to leading a team. I joined VisionTech Digital and was quickly the lead developer on a large amount of projects, and asked to be the replacement for the Head Developer role that was shortly going to be opening. An amazing opportunity for someone that was only soon turning 17.<p>Those 7 years from when I first discovered the internet and it&#x27;s wonders to VisionTech Digital were a blur, they seemed to go by so quickly, but the past 4 have gone by even faster.<p>Start ups, government enterprises, amazing projects through my own business, and most recently finding the joy of teaching, screencasting, and writing books and blog posts. My career has been full of amazing things.",1381299250,1450207814

When I came back from Jam Sessions at night I was so amped I could not get at sleep for maybe two hours. Then I turned on my computer and started writing java applications testing roulette systems. The fact you could spend your lifetime on finding THE SYSTEM was facinating to me. It is the same with music. It never ends. There are no limits. Having technical limits drives me crazy. And it drives me even more crazy if I have to wait for third party solutions. This is the point I start to create my own world and I am sure there are people out there dealing with the same issue as me. This is the way I came up with bandnova.",1393513255,1452922528

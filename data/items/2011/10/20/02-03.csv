3133227,comment,3130848,3132103,2,0,brc,,,"Yours is a common misconception of the Broken Window Fallacy.<p>Most people think the fallacy is just a statement about destroying things in order to create jobs.<p>While this is true, the deeper meaning of the fallacy is that every action has a consequence, both negative and positive.  But the problem most economists and politicians have is that they only look upon the easily measured and obvious outcome (the work for the glazier).  They fail to consider the non-obvious outcome, which is the tailor who sells one suit less, because the bakers money was diverted to the glazier instead.<p>The broken window fallacy is a tool to help us analyse <i>all</i> of the consequences of an action, rather than just the obvious ones.  So, whenever a make-work government program is announced, all we hear about is the x,000 jobs it will create.   What we don't hear about is the x,000 jobs that must not be created in order for those to happen.  We don't hear about it because it's likely to be 1 job across x,000 industries, rather than x,000 jobs in 1 industry.  The money for make-work programs must come from taxes, or from borrowings, which is just future taxes brought forwards.  Thus, when people pay more tax, they must therefore spend less elsewhere.<p>This is not a request for a zero-tax environment, it is just a call to recognise the entirety of economic actions, not just the obvious ones.  That is the broken window fallacy.",1319079514

If they are telling you to do one thing, you do another, and then get praised for it, and this is happening consistently you need to bring it up to understand exactly whats going on, either they really don't care that much and are leaving it to your discretion or there could be friction developing behind the scenes. At my current job we have weekly one on one meetings with the manager to bring any issues up and something like this would be a good topic for a one on one discussion. You don't want to get in the habit of doing more work than is needed, also, if you want to pursue UI development then consider finding a job that wants and appreciates that. The more complex the server-side coding becomes the less room there is for a ""jack of all trades"" so it really just depends on where you want your focus to go in your career. That said, a UI guy who has programming experience and understanding of server-side development, in my opinion, is always going to have a leg up on someone who doesn't",1319079468

3133205,comment,3130848,3131118,4,0,brc,,,"I agree with you totally.  The focus should be on increasing wealth through more production of everything.<p>Somehow we've ended up in a situation where everyone focuses on job creation at the expense of everything else.<p>Right now most families need two parents working in order to provide.  I think many would be happier with one less parent working if they could maintain the same standard of living.  That would be possible if one of the parents doubled their productivity.  Yes, it's a crude example but shows that focusing on jobs, and jobs only is looking at the wrong metric.<p>Counting jobs is as foolish as counting lines of code developed rather than the output of the code.  But because each job is attached to a person, we've all become blinkered to it, like a PHB counting lines of code and assuming progress is being made.<p>Wealth creation is simply the process of creating a better life through a combination of hard work and technology.  When you live better you're more wealthy.<p>Unfortunately, just about every initiative I have seen from any government for the last 10 years has been about job creation, when wealth creation isn't even considered, or, if  it is, in a distasteful manner, usually coupled with some reference to greed and profit. But the only way to create real jobs is to create wealth that people will willingly exchange their own labor for.",1319079031

You have to specifically get someones username in meatspace to be able to start following them on twitter; that probably works for your close friends but not at all for acquaintances. There are a couple of dozen people on Google+ and Facebook that follow me and vice versa that I have some interaction with that I never would have just gone up to and said ""Send me your google+ username"" in real life.<p>It just doesn't scale well at all; you have to memorize the mapping from username to actual name for your entire social graph. I have no desire to learn two names for each person, one actual name and one that looks like ""0x12"".<p>If I have an old friend named Pete Smith that I haven't interacted with in a while that is among the 200 people I am following on twitter, it's impossible for me to go look at his recent tweets or at-tweet to him something awesome that reminds me of old times, because I have no idea what his username is. His name is Pete Smith, that's what I always called him and that's what everyone calls him, why is he using a new name that potentially doesn't even map to something that people would identify as a name. There was a time where I knew my friend's username on a forum was some insane misspelling of Obsolete Oaf, and it was just literally impossible for me to type it because it was something like Obs0le7e 0af. I even knew my friends username was (in one sense) and I still didn't know it well enough to type it in to search.<p>There is enormous value to me in having people's names online be discoverable and searchable by the name that I actually know them by. Google+, Facebook and LinkedIn provide enormous value to me, tumblr and twitter provide almost none, and I don't think that is a coincidence.<p>Your experiences may differ, twitter and tumblr are both obviously very popular. I'm really not saying that you are wrong if you want to use those services, I do think you are wrong to act like a company is evil because it is providing a service that isn't what you want to use.",1319078676

This release tries does a very good job of both.  You're not going to make everyone happy, at the same time not all problems are easily solved.  What you call cutting corners could just be, they haven't figured out a great way to solve the problem.  Android supports just about all possible hardware configurations from low end to high end.  iOS supports pretty much 1 hardware configuration that they define (realistically Apple cuts out features out of older phones).  Like Nokia if google doesn't address big things, then some one will pick up the slack, so be it.  As the parent comment was pointing out, people are willing to pay for the luxury of animations, or polish.  For most people just getting calls, text, email and mobile web, at affordable prices is all we really want. Without actually knowing what Google's budget or legal/development/marketing etc costs are, I think theres really no way to assume how they prioritize things.

As long as the returns are better than the cost of the borrowed money, everyone wins.  If it doesn't, he loses because leverage works both ways.  Leverage is vitally important in making money, whether it is through getting other people to work for you, or getting other peoples money to work for you.  Any serious entrepreneur should have a deep understanding of the uses of leverage.<p>The problem is that artificial manipulation of the price of money (interest rates) gives a false signal for people to invest in an asset class, like real estate, because it artificially inflates returns.  Real Estate investing contains many risks (the largest is lack of liquidity), so it doesn't make sense to invest large sums for a small return.",1319078148

I can't see it achieving wider adoption. Nokia will claim a slice of this small niche, but that's all it will have.<p>WP can't survive on off-the-side interest from HTC and Samsung. Microsoft needs Nokia for WP to survive, so I fully expect Microsoft to purchase Nokia within the next five years.<p>I think Nokia would've been able to survive on its own had it gone with Android (earning a smaller slice of the Android pie, but still much larger overall). I think most technical-oriented people recognise that Nokia's expertise is in hardware - a quality that the Android ecosystem is still lacking. Samsung is getting there, but the N9's build quality is generations ahead of any of the Galaxy phones.<p>Nokia would always be my first choice in choosing an Android phone.

I don't know exactly what Roslyn does, but I see a lot of potential:<p>1. Measuring code complexity. I've often felt that code complexity can be gauged several ways, and one is the number of ""if"" statements (or select..case). Being able to query the code base of an extremely large solution is a big step in that direction.<p>2. Being able to ""query"" the call stack - how do I get from this line to the base constructor of my ""user"" object. Rather than stepping through the debugger, it could be a query of the code base to find the path from here to there.<p>3. Detecting bit-rot. Finding any method class that's simply never used could be another ""query"" of the code base. Yes, proper test-coverage would help detect this, but not every production system has unit tests.<p>4. I've worked on projects in the past where we really wanted to add guid tracing to the preamble of each function to dynamically trace the code at run time. If Roslyn supports ""update"" queries of the code, it might be easy to add such a feature across the whole code base (or perhaps only classes that inherit from some known base class).<p>Managing a code base like this (rather than grepping/searching) is a powerful concept.

If you want to talk to total strangers, then you want to be pseudonymous but you also have almost no reason to not post publicly.<p>That's fine; there is twitter, tumblr, even HN fit that model. All pseudonymous posts, all public all the time. Discussions with strangers.<p>Google+ can be used that way; I guess many people do. I somehow got marked as a redditor when I first signed up and I still have about 3 redditors that are strangers start following me every week, and I think it's pretty awful.<p>There is a huge space for online interactions with people who you know in meatspace, and plenty of reason why Google would want to get into that game. Product recommendations is the first thing that comes to mind; would you rather buy an item that your real life friend says is good or that a random person on the internet says is good? That is a benefit both to you and to google if they can provide that.<p>If you don't want to interact with people you know IRL, there are plenty of other services besides Google+ available online. Gmail remains one of them, it's a perfectly legitimate service to interact with strangers. It seems to me that you are throwing out the baby with the bathwater just because they are offering a product that you don't want to use, but that's obviously your choice.<p>> The only reason that it would take months to implement is because they're using some authoritative method - maybe ISP customer info, or government supplied info- to correlate users to reveal real identity.<p>This is seriously bordering on ""batshit crazy"" level conspiracy theory. What you are describing is impossible on so many levels; legal, technical and PR. I have no idea what they are implementing, but it's probably more along the lines of allowing people who are demonstrably known in real life by pseudonyms (like Lady Gaga, but less famous). The advantage is not from you using your real name, the advantage is from knowing the name that lots of people already know you by so all those people can easily find you on Google+.

For me, it's about the quality of the photo, not the convenience.<p>We're lucky to have choices. That's the beauty of it.",1319076022

Even replying it's great, because it's a short message. If I click on a link to a web page that has a mobile version, it's also great. Even though the screen is small, the site is designed so the clutter is gone and it's still easy to read.<p>Where my smartphone isn't so great is when the user experience breaks. I click a link and I end up on a site that isn't mobile friendly, is filled with junk and I need to pinch and zoom all over the place, I hate that. Or if I want to type in more than a sentence, I really hate the onscreen keyboard, or any small keyboard. Trying to do more involved things can be frustrating as well because it's never as fast as my desktop.<p>So really I think it's an evolving issue. Some things work great on it, many others not so much, but it's just a matter of time for many of these things to get better. When all sites have seamless mobile versions, when speech recognition is good enough that we won't need to type anything, we'll see smartphones be much better.",1319076003

8642677,comment,8641867,8642175,0,0,nirvdrum,,,"I did think about licensing.  There are two big problems with that:<p>1) The costs of running a single instance of the application far exceed the plans I was selling.  It requires a certain amount of amortization to become cost effective for a lot of people.  Dealing with Windows and Mac licensing and the hardware required just to get the browsers going, let alone the analysis engine, is too much for most of our customers.<p>2) Browser vendors pump out releases every 6 weeks.  Without some form of ongoing support, the app would become obsoleted in fairly short order.<p>As such, the licensing model only makes sense for those that are comfortable messing around with the source.  While the article makes it sound like it&#x27;s a coupled nightmare, most things are actually laid out very nicely.  But, it&#x27;s still a level of complexity a lot of people aren&#x27;t going to want to tackle.",1416596277

As I learned Mandarin Chinese as a second language up to the level that I was able to support my family for several years as a Chinese-English translator and interpreter, I had to tackle several problems for which there is not yet a one-stop-shopping software solution.<p>PHONOLOGY LEARNING<p>For ANY pair of languages, even closely cognate pairs of West Germanic languages like English and Dutch, or Wu Chinese dialects like those of Shanghai and Suzhou, the two languages differ in sound system, so that what is a phoneme in one language is not a phoneme in the other language.[1]<p>But a speaker of one language who is past the age of puberty will simply not perceive many of the phonemic distinctions in sounds in the target language (the language to be learned) without very careful training, as disregard of those distinctions below the level of conscious attention is part of having the sound system of the speaker&#x27;s native language fully in mind. Attention to target language phonemes has to be developed through pains-taking practice.[2]<p>It is brutally hard for most people (after the age of puberty, and perhaps especially for males) to learn to attend to sound distinctions that don&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. That is especially hard when the sound distinction signifies a grammatical distinction that also doesn&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. For example, the distinction between &quot;I speak&quot; and &quot;he speaks&quot; in English involves a consonant cluster at the end of a syllable, and no such consonant clusters exist in the Mandarin sound system at all. Worse than that, no such grammatical distinction as &quot;first person singular&quot; and &quot;third person singular&quot; for inflecting verbs exists in Mandarin, so it is remarkably difficult for Mandarin-speaking learners of English to learn to distinguish &quot;speaks&quot; from &quot;speak&quot; and to say &quot;he speaks Chinese&quot; rather than * &quot;he speak Chinese&quot; (not a grammatical phrase in spoken English).<p>Most software materials for learning foreign languages could be much improved simply by including a complete chart of the sound system of the target language (in the dialect form being taught in the software materials) with explicit description of sounds in the terminology of articulatory phonetics[3] with full use of notation from the International Phonetic Alphabet.[4]<p>Good language-learning materials always include a lot of focused drills on sound distinctions (contrasting minimal pairs in the language) in the target language, and no software program for language learning should be without those. It is still an art of software writing to try to automate listening to a learner&#x27;s pronunciation for appropriate feedback on accuracy of pronunciation. That is not an easy problem.<p>VOCABULARY LEARNING<p>After phonology, another huge task for any language learner is acquiring vocabulary, and this is the task on which most language-learning materials are most focused. But often the focus on vocabulary is not very thoughtful.<p>The classic software approach to helping vocabulary acquisition is essentially to automate flipping flash cards. But flash cards have ALWAYS been overrated for vocabulary acquisition. Words don&#x27;t match one-to-one between languages, not even between closely cognate languages. The map is not the territory, and every language on earth divides the world of lived experience into a different set of words, with different boundaries between words of similar meaning.<p>The royal road to learning vocabulary in a target language is massive exposure to actual texts (dialogs, stories, songs, personal letters, articles, etc.) written or spoken by native speakers of the language. I&#x27;ll quote a master language teacher here, the late John DeFrancis. A few years ago, I reread the section &quot;Suggestions for Study&quot; in the front matter of John DeFrancis&#x27;s book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, which I first used to learn Chinese back in 1975. In that section of that book, I found this passage, &quot;Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ&quot; (capitalization as in original). In other words, vocabulary can only be well acquired in context (an argument he develops in detail with regard to Chinese in the writing I have just cited) and the context must be a genuine context produced by native speakers of the language.<p>I have been giving free advice on language learning since the 1990s on my personal website,[5] and the one advice I can give every language learner reading this thread is to take advantage of radio broadcasting in your target language. Spoken-word broadcasting (here I&#x27;m especially focusing on radio rather than on TV) gives you an opportunity to listen and to hear words used in context. In the 1970s, I used to have to use an expensive short-wave radio to pick up Chinese-language radio programs in North America. Now we who have Internet access can gain endless listening opportunities from Internet radio stations in dozens of unlikely languages. Listen early and listen often while learning a language. That will help with phonology (as above) and it will help crucially with vocabulary.<p>GRAMMAR AND SYNTAX LEARNING<p>The third big task of a language learner is learning grammar and syntax, which is often woefully neglected in software language-learning materials. Every language has hundreds of tacit grammar rules, many of which are not known explicitly even to native speakers, but which reveal a language-learner as a foreigner when the rules are broken. The foreign language-learner needs to understand grammar not just to produce speech or writing that is less jarring and foreign to native speakers, but also to better understand what native speakers are speaking or writing. Any widely spoken modern language has thick books reporting the grammatical rules of the language, for example Modern Standard Chinese,[6] Portuguese,[7] and of course English,[8] and it is well worth your while to study books like that both about your native language(s) and about any language you are studying.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPhoneme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/Wha...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-Grammar/dp/0520066103/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars/dp/0415150329/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Brazilian-Portuguese-Grammar-Practical/dp/0415566444"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Brazilian-Portuguese-Grammar-Pr...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Falar-Ler-Escrever-Portugues-Exercicios/dp/8512543221/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Falar-Ler-Escrever-Portugues-Exercicio...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0582517346/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/...</a>",1416594783

Clearly the author is a dedicated researcher in his field.<p>It&#x27;s odd and ironic, but yes, the book has been repeatedly published in China and is widely available, even from a state-run bookstore. Perhaps this illustrates the point that, if you treat something like it ain&#x27;t no thang, people don&#x27;t notice and focus on it (the &quot;forbidden fruit syndrome&quot;). Or, alternatively, that most people don&#x27;t care about political satire as long their lives are improving materially.<p>A quote by Orwell from the article, showing his ethnic/national sensitivity in 1947:<p><i>We all have these feelings in one form or another. If a Chinese wants to be called a Chinese and not a Chinaman, if a Scotsman objects to be called a Scotchman, or if a Negro demands his capital N, it is only the most ordinary politeness to do what is asked of one. The sad thing about this alphabet-book is that the writer obviously has no intention of insulting the “lower” races. He is merely not quite aware that they are human beings like ourselves. A “native” is a comic black man with very few clothes on; a “Chinaman” wears a pigtail and travels in a junk– which is about as true as saying that an Englishman wears a top hat and travels in a hansom cab. This unconsciously patronising attitude is learned in childhood and then, as here, passed onto a new generation of children.</i><p>(The article explains that &#x27;Negro&#x27; was a term of respect at the time.)",1416594647

8642437,comment,8640820,8642386,0,0,DanBC,,,"Did you read the article?<p>> When Swanson first analyzed the ostensible connection between violence and mental illness, looking at more than ten thousand individuals (both mentally ill and healthy) during the course of one year, he found that serious mental illness alone was a risk factor for violence—from minor incidents, like shoving, to armed assault—in only four per cent of cases. That is, if you took all of the incidents of violence reported among the people in the survey, mental illness alone could explain only four per cent of the incidents. When Swanson broke the samples down by demographics, he found that the occurrence of violence was more closely associated with whether someone was male, poor, and abusing either alcohol or drugs—and that those three factors alone could predict violent behavior with or without any sign of mental illness. If someone fit all three of those categories, the likelihood of them committing a violent act was high, even if they weren’t also mentally ill. If someone fit none, then mental illness was highly unlikely to be predictive of violence. “That study debunked two myths,” Swanson said. “One: people with mental illness are all dangerous. Well, the vast majority are not. And the other myth: that there’s no connection at all. There is one. It’s quite small, but it’s not completely nonexistent.”",1416593205

sysvinit is quite easy to get, because you just apply what you already know (running shell scripts, running shell scripts with -x, read (log) files, etc.) and there isn&#x27;t a layer in front of you that you don&#x27;t know how to debug or trace.<p>And yes LSB init scripts <i>are</i> broken under systemd, exactly because of what you describe (placing echo doesn&#x27;t show) because it redirects the execution through systemd, and stores the output in journald.
Try writing (or debugging) an init script on a non-systemd system and see how much easier it is.<p>systemd also tries to act &quot;smart&quot;  and remember the last state a service was in which makes developing LSB init scripts on a systemd system ... complicated.
If an init scripts exits with success (perhaps because the deamon wasn&#x27;t configured yet) then systemd will remember that and the next time you issue a &#x27;start&#x27; it&#x27;ll be a noop, and claim it was successful.
Which leads to countless hours wasted until you figure out what really happened: systemd never even run your script again. So then you run &#x27;restart&#x27; on the init script and all is well again.",1416593068

287834,comment,287108,287710,0,0,walterk,,,"Well, I was reading it about 4 hours ago, and I'd like to be told why one should be libertarian. :)<p>But I'm genuinely curious to see what sort of reasoning led to Thiel's becoming a libertarian, and there's just not much to go on in the interview.  People of many political persuasions, after all, maintain a healthy dislike for totalitarianism.  And anyone who's taken Lord Acton's proverb to heart should recognize that corruption can manifest itself in those who hold market power just as easily as in those who hold political power.",1219819211

The new design plays much better to contrast. They took out unnecessary visual debris (well, besides the ads, of course).<p>This is at least one thing TC is has done right recently.",1219818696

The working examples definitely showed the difference on my iPhone on edge.<p>Second point: who in the hell cares how the word ""iPhone"" is capitalized?

It closely integrates with the Lucene search engine project.<p>If you want something which is very specific (like the hype machine) you can easily create a basic crawler in python. There is not much change in the crawling strategies. Just a basic programming knowledge and reading the documentation of the urllib module (in python) would be enough.",1219817734

Dishonesty implies deception -- intentionally misleading people.<p>The pastor in my example misled people with wrong arguments, but it was unintentional. While this type of action can lead to horrible results, it's hard to call the pastor ""dishonest"" if he didn't intend to deceive. Perhaps a better descriptor would be ""fool"" or ""ignoramus"".",1219816860

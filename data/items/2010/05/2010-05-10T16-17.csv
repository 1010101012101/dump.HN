Even there, photos are exposed in a special way because it's understood that people will want to do various interesting things with them (like edit them or upload them using different apps).<p>I think the real problem is in how the file system is presented to users.<p>When a user saves a file, they have no clue where they saved it.
The concept of file shortcuts is another killer - I've seen many cases where someone copied a shortcut onto a pen drive - or worse- burned it on a CD.<p>Instead of presenting a 'Save' dialog, have the user drag some file icon next to the top of the app into the desktop or some folder.<p>When browsing a list of files on the system - instead of showing folders in a hierarchy, show a list of apps - in each one, show the list of files whose last modification was done by that app.<p>Many users already follow a model like this- they just fire up the app and click the Open button which shows the most recently saved location.",1273510737

It does this by training the user to think of their files/content as being managed by an individual app that's responsible for manipulating it. This creates a single top-level ""folder"" for the user to use as a mental key to remember how to get at something.<p>Contrast that much shorter path to content to the standard desktop model of having a folder in your home folder, perhaps, to store documents. The ability to make sub-folders, sub-sub-folders, etc. and have all the contents of those folders utterly disconnected from the applications you use to manipulate and create that content.

1334810,comment,1334110,1334450,0,0,shaddi,,,"> You're working off of your terminal values, your moral judgement, that the outcomes in Afghanistan and Pakistan are bad.<p>Yes, the particular systems I'm referring to are bad, in my opinion. My base principles for making that assumption is that educational systems should not deny education to women, promote violence, or provide educations based on faith and mythology. If that is a purely moral viewpoint, so be it: we do not live in an objective world, and you're free to disagree with me.<p>But that is /not/ the point I'm trying to make here. Moreover, these are just an example of a potential failing of private schools. I could imagine several ways to defraud parents of the education they think they're paying for. My conclusion it's unclear what the incentive system for private schools to provide ""quality"" education (from the point of view of parents, students, and society as a whole) in an area where little or no educational institutions have existed before, and where institutions (public or private) do not exist to allow families to make informed decisions about the schools they're sending their kids to. It's a basic problem of incomplete information available to clients of these schools, that's all: can we (or someone else) come up with a way to allow families in these areas to make sure that the school they're paying is actually providing the education they're expecting to receive?<p>> what's wrong with a solely instructional institution that certifies competence in a given area?
I am referring to fraudulent organizations that award degrees based solely on payment, and provide no actual education, classes, instruction, etc. The system we have may be flawed but these do not do anything constructive to change it.",1273507386

So if I hire somebody to wash the dishes in the evening, it is costing me money. The value I get out of it is quality of life and is difficult to quantify.<p>Even for people running their own business on the side. Times and times again we see article on HN how IT guys can&#x27;t really be more productive than a few hours a day. Also, to get back to my dish washing example - I ( and other on HN too ) noticed that that sort of repetitive work is a lot better for reflection. Replacing it with a 1 hour session playing games, working or other activities may actually be overall detrimental to your side business.<p>What is actually useful though is to use your hourly salary to evaluate the cost of the services you buy.

8252582,comment,8251288,8251288,9,0,tbingmann,,,"The article is completely by side the point. He&#x27;s basically ranting about how they can&#x27;t test systemd on all distros, because every distro does things differently. How to fix it? Virtualize distros, yay. That may fix your problem, but no one else&#x27;s.<p>The real point is that, due to distro fragmentation, Linux gives the casual user an inconvenient shared library linkage experience. At the same time the distros are really good as packaging software, which gives us the &quot;one-click install&quot; experience we&#x27;re so use to. But they do so, at the price of compatibility, so we have the current distro lock-in situation.<p>Anyway, as an upstream software developer, I see the medal from the side of library linkage: when my program starts, the dynamic linker resolves this big list of symbols that my program contains and finds me matching libraries. You can extend this paradigm to icons, locale, and other support files as well.<p>So who tells the dynamic linker which symbols to match? Well, the contents of the shared libraries, and these already contain versioned symbols (e.g. this memcpy@1.0 does this, memcpy@1.1 doesnt do that anymore). The easiest solution to the matching problem is static linking. But that&#x27;s not what we really want, because we may actually want to replace symbols with better versions (due to security fixes, faster implementations, super-set of features, etc).<p>And who versions symbols? Well, usually the upstream developers of the important libraries do. And they do that somewhat remarkably well already, but it could be better. If your program uses an upstream that doesnt version things, well, bad choice, static linking is probably the best solution here.<p>So what I would propose, is to move the problem down to a linkage problem, with better consensus between binary creators and upstream authors on how to version symbols. And if my system currently doesnt have a matching symbol installed?  Just download it from the distro&#x27;s well-versioned repositories, maybe not the whole gtk+ library, but a diff of it to another version.<p>We would then in the end not have a package installer, but a fetcher-of-missing-versioned-symbols-for-a-binary installer. But this model is pretty far fetched, since the current method of compiling code into monolithic shared libraries is much simpler. On the other hand, the linux dynamic linker is already very intelligent, maybe it&#x27;s time for the large distros to cooperate on this level.",1409576121

Nix solves the majority of the problems he mentions, and it still has plenty of room for improvement to fill the gaps where it doesn&#x27;t.

Not because its true, but because mostly rich white kids are in those clubs so if you select those groups you&#x27;ll get the &quot;right&quot; people wrt race and income.<p>The problem is someone fakes their social life and interests to get into school, if they make it they&#x27;re going to be surrounded by a weird mix of genuine upper class kids who really did grow up enjoying sailing and playing polo, and a subgroup (perhaps too small to be self sustaining and supportive) of poseurs who don&#x27;t care about that stuff other than a means to an end.<p>There is an analogy in software hiring practices.  Obviously everyone knows from studies that higher IQ people are more successful.  But implementing IQ tests is a legal minefield.  Smart people can learn algos.  So google does or used to torture applicants with algo questions.  They&#x27;re not looking for people who know all about red black trees or implying that all jobs there use algos, but are selecting people who passed the &quot;IQ test that isn&#x27;t an illegal IQ test&quot; filter.  &quot;cargo cult&quot; copycat companies who do almost the same but miss the intelligence test part, perhaps by asking brainteasers or similar tasks that don&#x27;t require intelligence, are comical.<p>The moral of the story, is if you want to do something wrong or immoral or highly politically incorrect, you can get about the same outcome by playing games with overlapping venn diagrams and pretend that a right, moral, popular activity with a large overlap is what you &quot;really&quot; want.  A large part of adult/older human cultural interaction is understanding when someone&#x27;s talking exoterically or esoterically in order to respond correctly.",1409573396

That&#x27;s a downside, but it&#x27;s rare.<p>And variadic functions are easily translated as well. They&#x27;re much more syntactic convenience than true semantic variation. Typically, variadic functions encode defaulting which, in Haskell style, is just ignored. Otherwise, you just encode them as separate functions with different names. That can be annoying, but in my experience it rarely is. Worst case, you can often abstract over most of the polymorphism using a typeclass.<p>I&#x27;m sure you could manufacture some Clojure code which takes advantage of non-obvious macros, bizarre variadicity, and massive dynamic typing... but it&#x27;d be really hard to understand as a human.<p>Human intelligibility tends to drive Clojure code to be easily translatable.",1409573255

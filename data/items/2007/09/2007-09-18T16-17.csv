56358,comment,56278,56278,0,0,jdavid,,,"The goal of any startup is to find out early and often how customers will react to your vision.  If you have a vision of charging for a service, and you give it away for free; you may find people leaving to a competitor.<p>If ads are your vision, then establishing trust with your consumer base is critical.  They need to know that their information is not being used inappropriately.<p>You will also demonstrate value sooner to investors if you have an established revenue stream.<p>One option we have considered is establishing 2 brands, just for this purpose.<p>One can be ad based, and the other could be free or subscription based.",1190134322
56357,comment,55974,56302,0,0,rms,,,"Yes. I applied and got an interview with YC for what was more or less this idea... among other reasons for our rejection, one was that we failed the flexibility test by strongly disagreeing with Paul Graham's suggestion that the simplified subset of our problem to focus on was an ""internet picture frame with email"" which conflicted with our stated goals of not trivializing the internet appliance.<p>I would go so far as to not give the user access to low level storage, but only give them access to their files in the context of specific tasks that used them (unless they were in advanced mode). Email me if you'd like to talk about this more.",1190134207

It does not appear that tech will trigger the downturn (if there will be one) this time, but the question is how much will tech be affected? <p>Personally I believe that the solid business models will continue to prevail since internet traffic will continue to increase.

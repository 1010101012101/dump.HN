The Saudis were able to sell oil at a lower price than the USSR, took advantage of that and broke them. Any extra spending incurred by Reagan is a drop in the ocean compared the complete destruction of their revenue source.",1343001474

Think about this button's application in learning environments like Coursera lecture notes or a Now You Lost Me! button that allow users to append their thoughts to specific parts of a lecture or video.  Or what about a button you can press in a physical classroom?  It's really quite wonderful.<p>I agree with some of the comments though, my first reaction was, ""Don't leave it at where they got lost, let them tell you why.""  Maybe when users click the button a text box can fly out (gethopper.com does this really well) that allows users to append notes.  In some cases admins will read all the feedback, but if you want to get really fancy you could parse the responses for common themes, keywords, etc to identify the most common points of confusion.<p>Looking forward to seeing this develop, this is great.",1343001376

Pakistan is fairly developed considering the region it's in. It's also unstable because of the military from what I can understand.

That's the analysis that I've heard, but I don't know much about Pakistan.<p>We have problems with North Korea having nuclear weapons because they are extremely volatile. Their interactions with the South prove it. Those tunnels into SK that they used to send commandos in an assassination attempt? Or maybe the sinking of the South Korean warship? The shelling of an island? The list is LONG and a cursory glance of their Wikipedia page will prove that.\nCan you honestly tell me that you'd feel safe if North Korea had nukes?",1343001055

Meaning that even if you invented something first you can still infringe on a patent if somebody else is able to get to the patent office and pay them off first.</i> //<p>This is how it is in the rest of the world.<p>If patents are about giving information about inventions to the public domain in exchange for a limited time monopoly; which is the best form IMO. Then it is right to put pressure on inventors to either publish their inventions or patent them, their choice. If you find the invention valuable then you can patent it - submit a minimum sufficient disclosure to get a filing date and go on from there. If the invention is not so valuable or you want to merely protect from others filing then you can simply publish the invention.<p>The whole idea is to get new inventions published as soon as possible with enough detail to enable skilled practitioners to recreate the invention.<p>In the UK it is free to file an application; but you need to pay to get it processed, searched and examined.<p>WRT your last argument are you saying that you'd rather that patents take up more court time and attract more legal expenses (which ultimately get paid by consumers)?",1343000272

No brain? I mean come on. Jelly fish are floating piles of goo with absolutely no purpose or delight in life other than being floating piles of goo.

I don't think it is; I think your argument is self-defeating. It makes me want to make a LuaJIT plugin more, not less. LuaJIT is seriously cool.<p>If it were merely a question of some minor incremental improvement, such as could be obtained by ""contribut[ing] to one of the three open source JS engines"", then I agree it wouldn't be worth the fragmentation. But then it wouldn't meet the definition of a ""killer app"" either. Nor would it be likely to gain traction. It would just be a gnat.<p>What I'm talking about is only interesting if it might be disruptive. I think there's a chance that Lua as both language and implementation is good enough that it might enable things that simply aren't doable (performantly) in other ways. Perhaps I underestimate how many tricks the V8 people have left in their bag. I hope so. But at some point they're going to reach a wall caused by JS's design limitations that simply can't be drilled through. I take the existence of Dart to be a tacit admission of that wall. And what is so amazing about LuaJIT is that it has already proven it does not know that wall.<p>At the same time Lua is so similar semantically to JS that it is not likely to mess with the things that made JS great, so integrating Lua into the web would arguably be a conservative design choice  more conservative, perhaps, than many proposals to ""fix"" JS by making it more static and proper-like.",1342998915

4278807,comment,4276916,4278141,4,0,mikeash,,,"The thing is that the second amendment appears to be fundamentally different, in terms of human rights, from the rest. There are a lot of good arguments as to why allowing free speech, prohibiting unreasonable search and seizures, and other such things is a good thing in general, and are fundamental issues of human rights and freedoms. There are substantially fewer arguments as to why gun ownership is important to freedom in general.<p>If one were drawing up a list of fundamental human rights today, and were somehow completely ignorant of the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, what would it include? Would someone ignorant of the Constitution, but otherwise familiar with government, law, and freedom tend to include gun rights on that list?<p>The second amendment really seems like the odd man out. (Well, the third amendment is pretty odd too, but nobody cares about it these days.) Freedom of speech is important because the only reason to deny it is to oppress people. Due process and requirements for warrants are important because it keeps the government honest, and suspending them would cause more government abuse than it would stop crime.<p>But what makes a right to gun ownership important? What does it protect against, and what makes it better than not having that right?<p>I understand that reasonable people can disagree on this matter, and I hope we can have a reasonable disagreement here. What I'm trying to say is that the fundamental divide here is, as far as I can tell, precisely whether the second amendment enshrines a fundamental human right, the way we feel much of the rest of the Bill of Rights does, or whether the second amendment is out of place and does not describe a fundamental human right. To argue by saying that the other side's attitude would not play well when applied to other amendments in the Bill of Rights is to miss their motivations entirely.",1342998355

4278798,comment,4278037,4278037,7,0,tptacek,,,"I think people fixate too much on the supposed perks of SFBA and NYC. I concede that there is a kind of company best delivered from one of those two places; if your company is in any way premised on riding some kind of tech industry zeitgeist, it helps to be in the middle of the tech industry. But for the rest of companies, I can think of a bunch of reasons why you'd be better off elsewhere.<p>So to make that concrete, an unscientific comparison of Chicago (where I am) to SFBA (where I worked for ~4 years):<p>* Talent is cheaper in Chicago by high-single-digit percentage points<p>* Talent is more abundantly available in Chicago. There are (obviously) fewer overall candidates, but the competition for them is much lower.<p>* If you're in a specialized field (as we are), it's even better: the SFBA talent competition seems most intense for high-premium specialists, and markets like Chicago have disproportionately fewer opportunities for those specialists.<p>* Housing is significantly cheaper and thus dollar-for-dollar better and more convenient than SFBA.<p>* Public transportion as vastly superior in Chicago than in SFBA, which increases both the effective availability of housing (more neighborhoods are easily commutable) but also overall quality of life (if you want a tree-lined street with kids, you got it; if you want a 1 block walk to your favorite bar, you also probably got it).<p>* Much less ""networking"" in Chicago than in SFBA. I've met a lot of Chicago startup ""luminaries"" for various reasons, but can't think of any event where I could do so reliably, unlike SF.<p>* The startup population is growing in proportion with the nationwide startup population. This is in contrast to NYC, which is growing disproportionately fast. Our big names are Groupon, 37s, Grubhub. We've got a small number of local YC companies.<p>* I'm a bad person to ask about the funding market but it seems anemic compared to SFBA or NYC or even Seattle. This is a better place to bootstrap.<p>* I also think it's an easier place to bootstrap, because Chicago has a large number of businesses, and more diversity in business size (from a large population of approachable stable small businesses to a large population of major enterprises) and vertical (trading, banking, pharma, law, insurance, food, hospitality). I think this is a stark contrast to SFBA which, if you're not freemiuming to the whole Internet as your strategy, has an ""ice cubes to Inuits"" vibe to it.<p>* Way more available office space, both in the Loop (downtown) and on the north and near-west side (if you want to be SOMA-trendy about your company).",1342998228

4278796,comment,4276691,4276931,1,0,CamperBob2,,,"I've thought about that, but the problem is, such an encumbrance would zero out the value of the patent.  Your employer wants you to file patents not because they make their products more valuable, but because they make the <i>company</i> more valuable.<p>A possible compromise might be joint ownership of patents.  Maybe that's what you had in mind?  Under an arrangement like that, the engineer wouldn't have the right to stop his employer or a future owner of the patent from suing people, but he <i>would</i> have the ability to license the patent rights himself.<p>I like this idea because it leaves the value judgment to me.  If I don't agree that the cause is just, I can stop any offensive legal action simply by offering to license the IP to the defendant for $1.  If I work for Google and they want to get into some kind of galactic pissing contest with Apple, they can knock themselves out for all I care.  But if my patent ends up the hands of Uniloc, Acacia, or that Myhrvold asshole, I can shut them down.<p>Co-ownership of patents would still devalue the IP substantially, but that might be ameliorated if I agree in advance not to license the rights to anyone who has initiated any other legal action against the patent holder.  That would help maintain the patent's defensive value.  It could still be used in a FRAND licensing pool, for instance.",1342998196

So this is a big win for them.  A huge exit/IPO just about NEVER fails to have a Series A.  Given MY tolerance for risk, I'm probably prefer to own Weebly or Wufoo before most other YC companies...  But I think it's unlikely that they'll be a HUGE win for YC (9-figure exit, that is).<p>Entrepreneurs generally (maybe just sometimes?) get into the startup world in the hope that they'll see a multi-million dollar exit (to compensate for the risk and the lack of salary for a chunk of time).  For people motivated that way, the Series A is a big deal.  Wade through data of $5m+ exits and I think we'd find that the non-funded startup is pretty scarce.  Wad through the $20m+ exists and I think they'd be functionally non-existent.<p>Weebly took $650k according to CrunchBase, so they'd fall into the 6 out of 10 TechStars group, FWIW.",1258490233

The article is arguing that subjective, linear wine ranking is faulty, that preferences are not objective or static, that it's difficult to distinguish between similar wines and that identifying individual flavors and scents (eg, ""lavender, roasted herbs"") are tied to the taster's imagination.<p>If you can tell the difference between grapefruit juice and orange juice, you can tell the difference between a gabbiano, a monticello rioja and a generic merlot. They taste dramatically different and you can't give a merlot to someone who knows what chianti tastes like and have them believe it's a chianti. Different varietals have very distinct flavors.<p>And when it comes to quality, there is a much, much more significant difference between a poorly stored, very low-quality wine and a mainstream ~$10/bottle wine than there is between a $20/bottle wine and a $100/bottle wine.

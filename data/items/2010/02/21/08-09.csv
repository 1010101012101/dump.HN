This applies much more to music than to games, and more to games than to movies, due to budget issues (obviously).<p>It's just that you don't see most of it unless you're looking for it.<p>One of my music folders has around 64 days of music in it.  This folder contains entirely indie music, produced by a single category of fans, published biyearly at Comiket.  A large portion of it sounds professionally produced; I would say the ratio of ""good to bad"" is no different than that of professionally published music.<p>... and this is from one category of fans, from a single set of conventions.<p>For every professionally published album, there are a dozen garage bands publishing their own.  And even among those who do publish through a record label, there are thousands of indie labels.  When I hear a song I like and look it up on Wikipedia, a major label is the exception, not the rule.<p>Of course, I mostly listen to electronic music, so it might be different here.  But I doubt it.",1266742463

Five weeks later I'm not sure that's the case - I've gotten faster and more accurate with the virtual keyboard than I was at first, but I'm still a lot slower and less accurate than I was on the Blackberry (or the Palm Treo that was my primary phone before it).  I absolutely cannot use my N1 to compose any sort of text unless I'm sitting still; with the Blackberry I could fire off a message while walking down the street.<p>For day-to-day usage, I think the increased utility from the web browser and other apps (Google Voice rocks!) probably outweighs the decreased utility from quick/easy SMS and email replies, but like everything in the engineering world there's a trade-off.",1266741587

1140357,comment,1139764,1139764,0,0,cwilson,,,"Are people here really suggesting we replace a mouse driven hover state on traditional computers with a touch driven tap and hold on touch screen devices? How does that make one lick of sense? What do you do while you're tapping and holding? Use another finger to navigate around your hover based controls? This is so counter intuitive I'm a bit baffled people are even suggesting it.<p>Half of the brilliance of computing moving in the way of touch is that you start to interact with digital things the way you would handle actual physical objects. People have been training themselves to use a mouse to move a cursor around a screen for the past 25 years, which is really awkward when you think about it.<p>With touch things work exactly how you expect them to. There have been dozens of studies with very young children who have had 0 experience with traditional computers who simply ""get"" touch devices, because its human nature.<p>I believe Apple understands this and they are not going to spend significant time solving problems that do not need to be solved, especially when said problems really just need to be unsolved and forgotten.",1266741440

1140355,comment,1139838,1140269,0,0,patio11,,,"There is a long standing tradition at a major customer of my company, unrelated to this system, that any worker anywhere on the line can hit a Big Red Button which will stop the line if they detect a quality issue.  Hitting the Big Red Button has immediate costs: it delays production ($$$), it incurs overtime expenses to get the lost production back ($$$), it throws your supply lines into chaos ($$), it causes you to miss targets with your customers and pay out contractual damages ($$$$$$), etc, etc.<p>Hitting the Big Red Button on a software project is cheaper, but not free.  (For example, the Big Red Button plan for customer acceptance testing might sound like ""Nobody goes home if there is an unknown risk to delivery"", and a translation error anywhere means there is an unknown risk to delivery until you have verified that whatever process introduced the error was not similarly out of control elsewhere.)",1266741234

Yes, the concept of mouseovers could be done without (if it had been done without from the very beginning), but since so many Flash apps rely on it now, you can't have a decent Flash experience on a device that doesn't have it. Try using many Flash video sites without an ability to mouseover: the controls hide until their moused-over. A click on anything but the controls means ""pause"".<p>""and websurfing on even the best phone is so fraught with compromises and frustrating relative to a desktop that you really don't care (free).""<p>I strongly disagree. The web on phones before iPhone was indeed compromised and frustrating.

62253,comment,62030,62209,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm afraid Chrysler poisoned me as a customer before I was even old enough to drive.  My folks owned a couple of Chrysler products that were the worst vehicles I've ever dealt with: my mom's Dodge van once stopped steering while she was driving...yeah, the steering wheel just spun right around.  On another occasion the brakes simply stopped working, pedal to the floor and nothing happened.  Those are seriously dangerous catastrophic failures in dangerous circumstances and without warning.  The engine also had to be entirely replaced within weeks of the brand new vans purchase, but at least no one was in danger in that case.<p>I got to work on them quite a bit growing up--they at least gave me lots of experience fixing things.  But it'll take another generation before folks who experienced Chrysler in the 80's and 90's, like me, start buying Chrysler products again...and then only if they are actually making good cars now (which I'm not confident of).  I'm afraid I've been well-trained to buy only Japanese cars.  I've had two fantastic Nissans in the 20 years I've been driving, and one mediocre (but never broke in dangerous ways or left me stranded--it just had some annoying quirks) Toyota...I like to drive my cars into the ground, and the ground comes at me way too fast with American cars, and Chrysler cars in particular.<p>Sorry, I know you weren't looking for a rip on Chrysler, but suggesting I buy a Chrysler product sent me reeling into the past for a moment...I could smell the burning oil, feel the claustrophobia of laying on concrete under a jacked up minivan, and everything.  I just thought I'd share my pain with you.  ;-)",1191357759

62242,comment,61922,62194,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"> By the way, I haven't failed to notice that everyone except me is getting voted up in this ""little debate"".<p>I'm not among the ones voting you down.  I prefer to respond.<p>> I've seen what happens too many times when people don't play ""by the rules"" (whatever that means to you).<p>Sure, and I agree...where we disagree is on what those rules are.  My position is that offering someone a job is not a breach of ethics, unless there is a non-compete or non-association agreement in place.  The folks in this story are unrelated parties.  They have no contractual relationship, and seemingly no friendship to uphold.  While it would be rude to ""poach"" (note that I don't care for this word in this context--it puts the person being offered a position in the role of animal with no ability to think for or look out for his/her own interests) someone from a friends company, it is not a breach of any reasonable code of business ethics.<p>Good old boys, in the bad old days, might have had gentleman's agreements in place to keep folks from moving between jobs for higher pay and better treatment.  But those days and those boys are, for the most part, gone in the technology industry.  Employment is at will, and the best talent goes to the highest bidder (by some definition of highest, where Google redefines it to not be raw salary).  That is how it is, and how it should be.  What you're suggesting is, I believe, the unethical position.  When taken to its logical conclusion, you're suggesting that an engineer is the lifetime servant of the company he works for, and has no right to entertain other offers and no one has the right to make other offers.<p>In a previous thread, you've threatened murder in similar circumstances.  I believe we're at odds on this position, as well.  ;-)<p>> I don't think either party in this ""dispute"" emerges smelling very good.<p>Here, we agree.",1191356931

Freemium, enterprise/biz/groups functionality, etc.  The data is also pretty valuable...  If you've ever priced data from Comscore Media Metrix, you'll know that having good data on user behavior is pretty valuable...  Of course, this is only valuable if the users are a reasonable cross-section of users.  Then again, Alexa does pretty good business having a pretty non-representative sample...<p>If we go the enterprise route (I'm not eager to go there-- I'd prefer to focus on small/med biz if we create a biz offering), we'd certainly get insurance-- though the rates for professional liability insurance are laughable small when compared to other costs.",1191356683

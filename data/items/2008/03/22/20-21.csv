143552,comment,142454,142745,0,0,Shooter,,,"""Breaking the cycle and giving people a purpose in life, embracing them, can make a difference""<p>This article doesn't remind me of the gang stuff in Freakonomics so much as it reminds me of a bonus feature on the ""Sicko"" DVD.  Michael Moore goes to a prison in Norway that allows everyone, including murderers and rapists, the opportunity to work amongst the general population doing fulfilling work.  [They mention a prisoner, for example, that killed two people with a chainsaw.  He was allowed to finish his sentence by working in the forest freely with a chainsaw!]  Norway doesn't have a death sentence, nor even a life sentence.  The maximum prison sentence is 21 years.  And, by the way, Norway usually has the lowest murder rate in the world.",1206219383

143541,comment,143333,143333,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"He's right on most of the stuff he says in that article actually. Let's have a quick breakdown:<p>- Electronic publishing will not surpass traditional newspapers: newspapers may now be found online, but the majority of substantial content out there is still produced the out fashioned way by old fashioned reporters. Bloggers have done a pretty decent job of covering stories which are too niche for the mainstream presses (Engadget, TechCrunch etc), but have not come even remotely close to challenging traditional media. I saw a PBS documentary on the Iraq War which mentioned that traditional newspapers are both profitable and account for about 80% of new stories, with talking heads on TV mostly taking their cues from papers.<p>- multimedia software replaces teachers: I'd like to see someone try and argue he was wrong on this one.<p>- computers replace books - well, it hasn't happened yet, and it seems it won't happen until computers start to resemble books so much that there isn't any practical difference anymore. The Kindle, E-Ink, etc are all trying to make computers more like books, since no one likes reading off a screen, so I'll give him this point too.<p>- 'ocean of uneditted data': wikipedia and google have made a huge difference here, so he's wrong on this point<p>- digital networks change governance: Now that I think about it, isn't it a bit ironic that the rise of blogs, distributed networks, open discussion forums etc all took place during one of the most orwellian administrations ever? Unseen levels of secrecy, scandals too numerous to mention, a disasterous war, erosion of civil liberties, increased surveillance... one of the hubris around electronic governance made an once of difference.<p>- cyberbusiness: partially right on this one. The internet is great for some kinds of business and quite horrible at others.<p>- Online communities cannot replace real human ones: again, completely right on this one. While online communities are better than nothing, they pale in comparison with real human ones. There's a very good reason why startup hubs are as relevant as ever and YCombinator and its clones demand that you move to their location in order to partipate.<p>OVerall, a pretty good record of predictions and I suspect a lot of them will continue to hold for a very long time.",1206218589

143530,comment,143148,143148,0,0,startingup,,,"OK, I agree with 70% of pg's essay, but here is something that worried me. Most YC start-ups want to sell to large companies (they pay better!). Is pg saying that they go from being free men/women to caged animals? Or is he telling them ""take your money and run?"" If so, wouldn't a large company <i>knowing pg's advice</i> assume that people will leave quickly, so put a lesser valuation on a deal? After all, companies like Google acquire companies like Zenter for the talent as much as for the product. If the attitude is ""take your money and run"", wouldn't that necessarily lower the value of every YC company in the eyes of the large acquirer?<p>To an extent, there was always an element of start-up founders taking the money and walking, but by making things so explicit ahead of time, isn't pg unwittingly devaluing the very companies he has nurtured?<p>Second, what should an employee number 18 in a Loopt or a Scribd think? Should they start thinking ""I am not a founder, so I am missing something"". Apply this recursively ... is pg in effecting talking away the very talent that his companies need to grow?",1206217834

143521,comment,143239,143282,0,0,Shooter,,,"I would say that open-source is a ""long road"" for financial institutions, in general, even if it is not for rational reasons. They are concerned about crooks finding vulnerabilities they can exploit in open codebases, for example, and they are concerned about always having a 'throat to choke' in the form of a very solid support services provider.  Only when an open-source project is huge and very well-supported by several large systems companies do most institutions start to come around.  Linux, for example, has been hugely embraced by financial institutions...but most of that acceptance took place only after Red Hat, IBM (etc. etc.) were around for services/support contracts.  Financial institutions do NOT like risk.  They absolutely HATE risk.  A guy in a garage is a huge risk for them, even if you do develop a killer product/service.<p>As a 'guy in a garage,' I'm not sure a financial messaging product would be my choice to focus on, open-source or not.

This is probably the best example of utilizing Web 2.0 that isn't ambiguously superficial, no obscenely huge banners, flashing colors of ""beta"" texts.  You're attacking the technology at the core.  I congratulate you heartily, sir.<p>I would promote this service personally by NOT making it social (yet), for one thing.  There are lots of possibilities in socializing this type of software, which is truly unique and very helpful for research endeavors; all of them good.  This may kill some of the buzz you might get from TechCrunch or Mashable on the blogosphere, as it is a great app but I wouldn't rush to make it social just yet.  Find the user incentive to socialize it, understand the needs and demands, then bring in the sheep.<p>Great job by developing a bookmarklet: you see many blogs out there with autolinking, those double underlined links that popup little hover boxes and kill usability by displaying a screenshot of what they're going to see.  Maybe even develop your bookmarklet so that it will bring up a smaller, unobtrusive hoverbox with the page title of where you're going (eg. Wikipedia: Tibet) for the end user.<p>You are correct in estimating that not very many people would find this useful.  You may target it at education based blogs, or even yes, wikipedia editors.  I know one guy who was just elected to an editor position and I'll be more than willing to ask him if he'd find any use in it.<p>Finally, commercialization really should be your last thought.  37Signals put it best, solve your problems first and the rest will fall into place.  Build to solve problems, not create new ones with financing.<p>Just my two cents.

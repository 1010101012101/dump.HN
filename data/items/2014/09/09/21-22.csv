I&#x27;ve built a few applications in my work where I&#x27;ve always had comments about how easy it is to use, as well as websites and done small bits of design here and there. I&#x27;m a security hobbyist and I&#x27;ve just switched over to Ubuntu on my desktop. As most of you would know, most security tools are written with CLI&#x27;s in mind. This is likely to automate a lot of the tasks, and speed up workflows for the power users.<p>But from a usability point of view for beginners (I come from Windows 95 and Macintosh II, so I&#x27;ve always had a GUI) and the younger crowd, I think the barrier to entry for a lot of these tools would be lowered if they had a GUI.<p>Pretty much what I&#x27;m asking; is does HN think it would be helpful or beneficial to contribute to existing projects by building GUI&#x27;s for them (or improving existing ones)? A good example I think is ZenMap GUI for nmap. Tools I have in mind are:<p>wpscan, joomscan, sqlsus, grabber, fimap, deblaze and BlindElephant (and improve wfuzz&#x27;s GUI, forgot the name for that project though).<p>Also if you have any ideas for others let me know.

But this knocks down an awful lot of the criticisms I&#x27;ve had of existing smartwatches. The smaller Apple Watch is 38mm, certainly not small but by no means an irrationally huge behemoth. (Even the larger is only 42mm, I believe.) When you consider the three lines, two sizes, and multiple bands, there&#x27;s dozens of combinations available. You may personally not like the fashion sense, but other than the Moto 360 this is the first smartwatch that&#x27;s had a fashion sense to criticize. (And guys, the Moto 360 is 46mm, so let&#x27;s not pretend it&#x27;s svelte, either.)<p>But what&#x27;s really interesting to me is that Apple has clearly put a <i>lot</i> more thought into how interactions on a device like this should work than anybody else. Yes, I&#x27;m sure every single component has an antecedent you can point to, just like the iPhone&#x27;s interaction model. Except that nobody put it all together like that before the iPhone. And nobody put it all together like <i>this</i> before the Apple Watch.<p>I&#x27;m not so glib as to say that catcalls when Apple introduces a new product are a sure sign of success (I remember the iPod Hifi, thanks). But again, it&#x27;s hard not to see a few recurring patterns in the responses: oh, look, it doesn&#x27;t do everything that it could (or that competitors already do!) and it&#x27;s too expensive. If it sells well, it&#x27;ll only because of the Apple faithful buying everything.<p>And, of course, if it sells well, than within a year all smartwatches will adapt its interaction model. Other manufacturers will come out with variants that Apple isn&#x27;t making, and we can move onto the evergreen phase of dismissing Apple as a company that just copies everybody else.",1410298572

8293310,comment,8289718,8291741,7,0,adamjs,,,"I might be able to give some insight, I helped found the RO emulation community back in 2003. Along with AppleGirl, I (AjS15822) made some of the first English NPC scripts used in all Athena servers, participated in YARE, contributed code to Athena, and ran several of the forums.<p>It&#x27;s been a decade so my memory is a bit fuzzy, but here&#x27;s what I remember about that time:<p>We started with AEGIS (leaked Korean server files) on the asb-sakray board [1] but it was notoriously hard to setup since it had major MSSQL and ODBC driver dependencies (I wrote guides). We started work on an installer for Aegis but realized we wanted to customize the server even more.<p>A few emulators started to take hold at this time (YARE probably the biggest) but Gravity (creator of RO) threatened legal action and shut it down.<p>Enter &quot;Athena&quot;— we discovered a Japanese RO server emulation project on the &quot;Avethes&quot; BBS that had the most complete packet mapping at the time. AppleGirl did most of the first translation of the code (AppleMod) which spawned a ton of other English emulation forks as the YARE developers jumped back on.<p>It was a really fun time for me— age 14, not much programming experience, in the middle of this massive, open-source MMORPG emulation war. I learned so much about C++, network programming, and server architecture during that time (as did many others). All the different forks openly stole code and ideas from each other so things moved very quickly.<p>The beautiful thing about writing code for RO private servers was the immediate sense of gratification you got. I could implement a small change to a skill, or a new NPC behavior, and then immediately log into the client and see it in action (and then thousands of users would see it in action when we committed the change).<p>We weren&#x27;t concerned so much about code quality in the beginning since Athena strived to be a server modder&#x27;s paradise— if you wanted raw stability, you went with Aegis instead. Stability came later once all the projects eventually aligned under one flag (eAthena).<p>I left in 2005 to work on server emulators for Lineage II, and later got bored of servers and jumped to client-side graphics programming, where I&#x27;ve been happily working for the last seven years. (Funny enough, my latest project [2] was used in Lineage II as well as hundreds of other MMOs and games, so I&#x27;ve now written code for both emulators and official. :))<p>[1] <a href=""http://forum.asb-sakray.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.asb-sakray.net/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.awesomium.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.awesomium.com/</a>",1410298210

Here&#x27;s the thing: have you run filesystem recovery tools lately? Because if you&#x27;re at that point, your data is toast.<p>It&#x27;s toast if you were running mdadm or RAID. It&#x27;s toast if a file gets deleted and recovered by ext3/4 (good luck figuring out which chunk you&#x27;re looking at in lost+found).<p>The second article is simply stressing my original point: ZFS cannot protect you from bad RAM. No file system can. If data is corrupted in RAM, ZFS will checksum that and write it to disk. <i>This is exactly what will happen with any other filesystem</i>.<p>ZFS storage pools can recover from fairly dramatic failures. You can lose a disk out of a non-redundant stripe and still have complete metadata (just incomplete data, but checksums tell you exactly what you lost). Unimportable pools are not something that easily happens without severe damage - a corrupted uberblock can recovered by using the zpool import -T to rewind a txg and get back a verifiably complete copy of your data.<p>This idea that somehow the failure mode of other filesystems to faulty RAM is better is destructive fiction. You have no idea if your data is valid on disk. You have no way to verify if the data is valid in the first place. And the degree and number of failures required to wipe out a pool would also wipe out any other storage system. The idea that recovery tools will save you in a catastrophic failure (of what kind?) is laughable. This can be trivially explored by trying to recover a deleted file in ext4. Sure, it <i>can</i> technically be done. Good luck with doing it more then once.",1410298150

On every smartwatch, there&#x27;s a lot of swiping around to do basic navigation, but there&#x27;s not been a really good way to zoom in and out. Apple&#x27;s implementation allows for apps like their photo demo to be more practical. I&#x27;m suspicious that they might be overusing it -- the idea of needing to zoom around to launch apps seems less like a good idea, but overall the novel input method is an innovation I&#x27;d say.<p>I assume they must have NFC in the watch to handle the payments system.

Besides the major players, there were any number of mail and public post networks that ran on hobbyist bulletin board systems (FIDONet and WWIVNet are two that come to mind on the BBS end, and BITNET was a popular academic network before TCP/IP took over the world).<p>Toward the end, there were gateways between (almost) all of these systems that worked more or less reliably. You had to keep a text file handy to figure out how to mung an address on network #1 so that it would delivered to network #2.<p>For instance, a WWIVNet user could send email to foo@bar.com by sending it to foo#bar.com@5XX, where 5xx was a WWIVNet node number in the 500 range (these were reserved for gatewaying purposes). An Internet user could send email to 23@9073 on WWIVNet by sending it to 23-9073@(some site that was running the gateway software).<p>Similar address rewriting hacks were used for the other networks. Some were pretty straightforward -- I remember CompuServe used addresses roughly like 888,923423. To send mail from the Internet to CompuServe, you just had to change the comma to a period and tack @compuserve.com on the end.

Plus actually using it will eat through battery quicker (it wasn&#x27;t a 36-hour device for me like the iPhone 5C was, despite similar usage) and (this one surprised me) eats more data.<p>Not to mention if you have kids, the lack of iMessage and the inability to forward an HD video over to your spouse of the kids is almost a deal-breaker all by itself.<p>Anecdotal, my 2c, etc. But I owned a Nexus One, every iPhone except the 3GS and 5S, a Samsung Galaxy S2, Moto X, Palm Pre, Palm Veer (loved that little guy, just too buggy) and most recently an LG G2.<p>Discounting Apple on the basis of hardware and perceived performance would be a big mistake IMO. They&#x27;re head and shoulders above everything else on those counts IME, and age so much better.<p>I got so tired of the quirky G2 (I swear there was a 1 in 3 chance that just unlocking the phone would launch the Alarms app for no reason, and that forced Menu button... GRRRR) I swapped my SIM into an old iPhone 4S I had lying around yesterday. It&#x27;s not quite as snappy. But it&#x27;s not half bad either. From a perceived performance perspective (say that three times fast!), the G2, a flag-ship Android phone released only 12 months ago, is slower in every way than an iPhone 5, a phone twice it&#x27;s age (and yup, the G2 has 2GB of RAM, the iPhone 5 had 1GB).<p>If you prefer Android more power to ya. But if you&#x27;re a long time iPhone user... Maybe I&#x27;ll convince you to save some heart-ache (and $$$). ;-)",1410297737

If man -> sales If woman -> recruiter<p>Thus, the gender bias is as to which non-technical role the poster puts you in, not whether they think you are non-technical.<p>Yes, I was wrong to indicate there was nothing sexist at all about the post.  I was thinking primarily of the non-technical part.<p>> Moreover, this person was suggesting that &quot;incapable coder&quot; -> not a coder. Which is sort of weird.<p>I see that sentiment expressed about programmers of all types.  It&#x27;s the idea that if you are not at a certain level you are a faker, and thus not really a &quot;coder&quot;.  I see such accusations leveled at people constantly, without regard to gender.<p>The core point I was making is that you are not being typecast as non-technical for being a woman.  You are being typecast for the writings for which you are best known, not for being a woman.<p>EDIT: So, I posted this reply from my comments view four hours after my GP post.  Then I went back and read your other comments.  In that context, I change my opinion.  The submitted blog post needs the details you posted in this thread, and on it&#x27;s own does present a very strong argument.",1410296646

I am not a lawyer, but through this whole affair, I have listened to tech pundits and others opining about the case, and I have become more and more frustrated as these people provide lazy opinion based mostly on irrelevant information.  Its not the patent abstract, or common belief of what a specific patent entails, that matter. Its the very specific patent claims.  The same goes for ""prior art"".  People really need to read the patent claims, and consider all the claims in the patent as a whole, before expressing frustration about how these cases are developing.",1346212742

If I understand correctly:<p>1) I would define something as ""not cracked"" if it is as strong as its password--in other words, there's no way to circumvent it that isn't a general vulnerability (peek through my window, get a keylogger on my machine, etc.) I assume you're telling me that this is the case with WPA2.<p>2) It sounds as though you are saying that something like WPA2 doesn't just authenticate a login but remains in use as an encryption key for subsequent wireless data interchange between client and base station. If I'm understanding correctly, that's a powerful point.<p>3) I knew that MAC addresses could be spoofed, but I was thinking they wouldn't know WHICH MAC address to pretend to have. Of course, if I'd been a little smarter, I would have noticed that my own linux process was using the MAC address a client claimed to have to throw out unrecognized machines (before I had MAC address filtering as a built-in router feature). If they were sending their MAC address to me, then my own client machine would be sending its MAC address in clear text to them, telling them which MAC address to pretend to have. Duh.<p>Well, I feel a little dumber and a little smarter. Time to go change my network. Thanks again.",1346211787

Classes weren't what I would describe as educational - a better image would be some big corporate bureaucratic job where the solution to every problem is obvious but you have to spend a lot of time time figuring out just how, precisely, to flatter your superiors. Maybe if you're being cynical you could say that's the best education you can get, but I wasn't impressed.<p>What Columbia does give, and what apparently holds a lot of water, is an semi-official grant of being Better Than Everyone Else. It's ridiculous that kids who learned nothing are rented out by consulting firms for a quarter million a year to come into a company they have no familiarity with and have all the answers to everything, but they get away with it because they're Better Than Everyone Else. Of course a piece of paper doesn't make you competent, and the compiler doesn't care where you went to school, but there are so many times you rely on someone else's positive appraisal of you (hiring, funding) that brand name has a massive impact. It's turtles all the way down, too. The University of Illinois is more prestigious than Illinois State, but who actually knows which is better at teaching?<p>The current problem with higher ed is that for most purposes in the current economy it just functions as a class system.

You can't get that job, but you can get another that's no so bad. You went to University of Phoenix?

All &quot;we&quot; are saying is that what some perceive as &quot;ability&quot; is, in fact, a combination of talent with a lot of privilege, luck and encouragement by society (of course, some people beat the odds but those are the exception, not the rule). There is no shortage of talent in any group, and ability should therefore be nurtured by removing some very powerful discouraging factors.",1419346752

I really missed it when I switched to Python (sure, there&#x27;s OrderedDict, but it&#x27;s a second-class citizen: there&#x27;s no syntax for literals and standard APIs don&#x27;t explicitly take advantage of it).<p>Missing syntax sugar makes it a second-class citizien? How? Also what advantages could standard API (<- what does that even mean?) take?<p>> It&#x27;s neat for sorting objects without having to mutate them to add a key or wrap them in a key/value object.<p>It&#x27;s called set()<p>>  It&#x27;s great for configuration with JSON-like structures, but key order gives extra flexibility in the design, e.g. instead of [{id:&quot;foo&quot;},{id:&quot;bar&quot;}] you can use [&quot;foo&quot;=>[],&quot;bar&quot;=>[]].<p>...and the reason you cant use OrderedDict here is you dont like it.<p>About ordering stuff: after years I can still remember the problems I had with ordering in PHP. There&#x27;s more than a dozen of sorting methods, which is mess. No one can remember if they all behave the same way and what&#x27;s the order of its parameters. In Python you&#x27;ve sorted() and that&#x27;s it.
You cant do any advanced stuff with these array, because sometime they act as lists and sometime they act as hashmaps. I&#x27;ll take this example from &quot;Fractal...&quot;:
$first  = array(&quot;foo&quot; => 123, &quot;bar&quot; => 456);

Close cooperation by the standards of the day that is, in personal meetings and messages conveyed on horse-back.<p>Neither knew from which direction Napoleon would attack, and when he did he took both Blücher and Wellington by surprise.

The likely scenario is that (initially) high-end luxury cars will get features that could allow them to operate autonomously on designated sections of highway. The problem, as you point out, is that it would take concerted public action to change laws and designate those sections (perhaps requiring some sort of radio beacons to enforce the designation).

My HN account? Nope... sorry to inform you, but I&#x27;m just weird. Anyone who knows me will attest to that. I&#x27;m generally far too full of energy, but depending on the occasion oscillate between a playful and pensive writing style. Here&#x27;s my quora page, and a blog post I did earlier this year if you want to cross-check.

If I&#x27;m super excited (as I was when people were posting awesome feedback,) or trying to get/keep someone&#x27;s attention - it&#x27;ll be more energetic/playful.

I think it&#x27;s worth to spend 1% of your work time on customer support to gain an understanding of that on a deep, visceral level.",1419343285

(Of course that doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense as an attribution, as Anonymous isn&#x27;t really a <i>group</i> of any conventional kind.)<p>This looks like a small DoS against one router, as any random could do (and perhaps has done), but of course, .kp doesn&#x27;t have much connection to the public internet, so that&#x27;s about all it takes. And it isn&#x27;t exactly a big impact on them as a country - yet it&#x27;s still knocking a country off the internet.<p>I believe the attribution to DPRK is very probably false. I think the Sony hack was quite probably conducted by non-state actors, but there is far too little information to be sure. The US have unfortunately impeded honest forensic investigations.<p>And I believe that attacks on the internet, any part of it, are destructive and not constructive. The US would be <i>extremely displeased</i> if the same - cutting it off the internet - happened to it, so I dearly hope they are not stupid and short-sighted enough to be responsible! Whomever is behind this deserves condemnation.<p>Perhaps we need a treaty. Yet when a few determined individuals can do offensively essentially what a nation can, I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s possible. But focusing on offense will only make everything worse - the US probably has more to lose from so-called &quot;cyber war&quot; than any other nation on earth. It should be leading the charge against it. It isn&#x27;t. And that&#x27;s a huge mistake.",1419343234

No jQuery or whatever necessary ... if all you're doing is basic event handling and you know how the DOM works for other things, it really isn't much trouble to include this and a couple other small functions in a one-off, and is far preferable to including a hefty all-purpose DOM abstraction library like jQuery or MooTools.<p>Their example including an ugly onclick attribute doesn't imply that that is the only way to do things, it merely demonstrates the absolute simplest way to use the library. Of course any fool can use a script that includes the function above and locates the element manually.",1310313280

2747928,comment,2747621,2747636,10,0,bobthebee,,,"True. But to go a level deeper, Facebook is dangerous to Google, because:
1) The competitive advantage of AdSense ($10 billion in annualized revenue) is all about having better user profiles that can translate into better syndicated ads. Facebook will undoubtedly launch a competitor given the hires they have made.
2) The competitive advantage of AdWords ($20 billion in annualized revenue) is mostly about having better search results. Again driven by better user understanding.<p>Facebook has excellent information on users interests. As opposed to MySpace and Twitter, most of the data on Facebook is not crawlable. It's private data, which means that Google is completely locked out. Even if it was crawlable, the data is not as valuable since Google would have to try to interpret it, while Facebook knows what it really means.<p>Summary: Facebook is an existential threat to Google's two major lines of business AdSense and AdWords.

Even jQuery's $('#some-element') selector is simply calling getElementById('some-element') under the hood and then wrapping it in a jQuery object.<p>And technically the onClick stuff can still be unobtrusive, as long as the link still works as intended with javascript disabled (i.e. it's a normal link and doesn't have something like href=""#"".<p>But all technicalities aside, I totally agree with your sentiment.

The Bell telephone network of the first half of the 20th century was a marvel by the standards of the day.<p>Anyway, there honestly wasn't much of a problem with doing things that way from most customers' point of view: Bell owned the telephone equipment, but that was a good thing because it was expensive stuff, and they would maintain it for you. Moreover, there just wasn't much opportunity for differentiation in CPEs (customer premise equipment, the stuff in your house): battery technology wasn't at the point where wireless handsets made sense, commodity answering machines were a long way off, et cetera. In total, in terms of Bell's ability to roll out the network quickly, it was probably a net win with regard to the technology that they kept the whole thing closed.<p>Now, obviously it also gave them the opportunity to act pretty anti-competitively, and obviously that was not good for customers. But it's often been observed that huge infrastructure buildouts are much more efficiently done under central control, and given the choice between the Federal government doing it and Ma Bell doing it, I'll take the latter.<p>[1] I've read and implemented most of the Bellcore standards; in the past I worked on a team doing integrated telephone line control circuits (SLICs), and if you think fifteen years of web standards turns into a rats nest, try implementing 100 years of standards plus working around well-known cases that break those standards but are too widespread to ignore.

2747883,comment,2746698,2747578,3,0,to3m,,,"C is actually one of the few languages that gets the language/library separation mostly right. You can write pretty much the entire standard library in C, and you can easily write C without the standard library. It's very straightforward (if sometimes a bit annoying) to do this in Windows, and I believe neither EPOC/Symbian or PalmOS supported the ISO C library.<p>varargs, setjmp/longjmp and sbrk are 100% library. You can do varargs without stdarg.h; if you know the calling convention, you can just walk through the memory occupied by the arguments. setjmp is trickier but if you know the rules you could write it using assembly language, just like the library writers did. As for sbrk, I'm not terribly familiar with that I do admit, but judging by the man page it is not part of the C standard library, kind of proving my point. But you can definitely have a heap, and allocate out of it, and (where plausible) grab more address space, without having it.",1310310720

HHVM is fairly stable and is used by Facebook to serve over a billion web requests per today. In the past year or so developers outside of Facebook have started using HHVM to run other PHP codebases, and at present 20 of the top PHP frameworks are able to run correctly on HHVM (hhvm.com/frameworks), with 9 of the framework&#x27;s test suites fully passing.<p>If you encounter behavioral differences or bugs when running HHVM, you can report it at our github site (hhvm.com/repo) and we will help get it resolved.",1395341970

When I do sit, I like my desk to be almost on my lap, so that my arms hang straight down, and my elbows are very close to 90 degrees.  I find this very comfortable.  However, it means the desk itself has to go fairly low (mine is at 26.5 inches or 670mm right now).<p>Point is ... if you get a standing desk, make sure it works when sitting just as well as when standing.

7437794,comment,7436140,7436964,1,0,Theodores,,,"You have a good memory!<p>If I remember...<p>The original Daewoo cars in the UK were based on old Astra (and other Vauxhall) models, with body panels that were just not quite as well defined as the Astra originals. This appearance was a bit like the tacky Rover versions of Honda cars or how we imagine Chinese &#x27;knock offs&#x27; to look. They were competing against Lada and other low price motors at the budget end of the price range. I don&#x27;t think the service-by-Halfords arrangement worked out too well for them and other dealerships tried their hardest to do them down. Nonetheless they were a disruptive presence in the marketplace - at the time I lived in a rural part of Wales and those Daewoo efforts were quite common.<p>In a UK context the Tesla dealerships are probably more akin to the McLaren dealerships (I think these are owned by M(a)cLaren, i.e. Ron Dennis et al., but they could be a franchise). McLaren are an up-market premium brand and, having a McLaren dealership in nearby Knightsbridge, probably isn&#x27;t going to stress out the Ford dealers on the A5 (or rural Wales) in the same way that Daewoo disrupted things. I think our American friends are over-worrying about the &#x27;threat&#x27; Tesla are to regular car dealers.",1395341821

(Please elaborate if I misunderstand!) We rely on interface and class definitions in order to know what methods are available, and even though the runtime resolves everything at runtime so you can call any method that happens to exist at that time (&quot;duck typing&quot;), we enforce statically that methods do exist where we can. So for example, the following code will work at runtime since the method `g` does exist, our static typechecker will reject it since it does not exist on type `I`.<p><pre><code>  <?hh // strict\n  interface I { public function f(): void; }\n  class C implements I {\n    public function f(): void {}\n    public function g(): void {}\n  }\n  function f(I $i): void {\n    $i->g();\n  }\n  f(new C());</code></pre>",1395341805

A free market is not a market without regulations any more than a free society is a society without laws.<p>In both situations, freedom is best defined as that which the weakest member of the group has. A society where the weak can be bullied by the strong, coerced and cajoled by threats of force, is not a society where those people can be considered free. Unless you think that slaves are also free people, provided that there are no laws concerning slavery.<p>Similarly, I don&#x27;t see how a market can possibly be considered free if strong incumbent players are able to exert extra-market pressure on the weak players, to bully them in ways &quot;outside&quot; of normal market forces. Rather, a free market is one where all players are free to act on an equal footing, competing on price, quality, service, reputation, and other &quot;market-based&quot; differentiators, rather than through bribes, collusion, artificial barriers to entry, and the like - because the playing field is forced level by regulations which apply to all participants equally.",1395341653

On the very optimistic side, consider the possibility that AirBnB makes hotels almost entirely obsolete (it is definitely putting pressure on them). Hotels are expensive and cookie-cutter. While in some ways predictable is their advantage, expensive is not, and cookie-cutter is boring. AirBnB offers location (location location), comfort (home away from home), privacy (if you want it), and novelty (every trip is different). Major pluses in my book.<p>> Once they are forced to play on a level playing field,<p>What happens if they aren&#x27;t, ever? What happens if cities all over the place actually accommodate them? Unlikely, sure--but it&#x27;s easy to be a naysayer on the internet. It&#x27;s more likely what will happen to them is what is happening to Uber et al. Some places accommodate sycophantically (SF), some places go the opposite direction (Seattle). And anywhere that accomodates, AirBnB stands to take a huge chunk out of the existing hotel biz.<p>There are smart people working on these valuations, on both sides. AirBnB has real, valuable network effects that need to be considered. I don&#x27;t imagine to be able to gauge this one accurately purely based on &quot;c&#x27;mon, thats so much money!!&quot;. I&#x27;m honestly more a pessimist on AirBnB. But I&#x27;ve been a resolute pessimist before and gotten burned badly (e.g. stock market 2013, anyone?)",1395341624

So, no.<p>Aside from that, while a more permissive license was not part of my original goal or vision for musl, it&#x27;s something that could never have happened by working on improving glibc. Right now we&#x27;re facing a situation where Linux has been fragmented into a &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; minority made up of hackers&#x27; desktop PCs and enterprise servers, and an overwhelming Android majority. The latter is using a grotesquely incompatible, poorly designed, non-standards-conforming libc called Bionic, and if you want to run existing C programs on Android, you have to add heaps of #ifdef hackery to them to make them compatible with Bionic (much like the #ifdef hackery needed to make C programs work on Windows).<p>musl can provide a real, standards-conforming libc for use on Android that&#x27;s still light and MIT-licensed (important because Open Handset Alliance members have a contractual obligation to Google not to add copyleft code to the system they distribute). This means, in theory, we can do away with the whole #ifdef mess and just run existing, portable software on Android. In short, it has the potential to free FOSS projects from getting bogged down in the maintenance burden of supporting yet another gratuitously-incompatible system (Android) in order to remain relevant.",1395341537

The idea behind this is to make it easy to bring your money into the country on favorable terms, but hard to take it out (so you have to spend it there and repatriate the money through transfer of goods). In an inflationary system, you often have a capital class in power in a country, and high inflation keeps them in power since they own all the means of production.

7437658,comment,7431209,7433172,2,0,malandrew,,,"I would love to see someone create a &quot;marketplace for rent control rights&quot; in housing markets currently being fucked by rent control.<p>The idea here would be that anyone with rent control for a certain unit would be able to put out an offer for conditions under which they would vacate the property. Once you have standing offers for all units in a building, a developer could make a bid to satisfy those rent control rights and buy the property from building owner.<p>People with $800 rent control in say a studio might be willing to exchange their studio apartment for a 1 bedroom in a new building within 1-mile in the regions of a city, and this new unit would come with a contract for all the same rights as rent control, but that it would be limited to that tenant and that tenant alone (it can&#x27;t be &quot;passed&quot; on by adding people to the contract).<p>So lets say I&#x27;m a developer with a few properties under construction. When I see a building where all the tenants have made offers that I can meet in some way using units in my projects under construction. I crunch the numbers and make offers to each of those individuals. Once I get all the tenants to accept the offers I make, I then approach the property owner and make an offer on the property. Once I buy the property, I can then give each of those tenants a property in my other buildings and then demolish the original building and build something taller with more units. Even if I destroy the old building and build something newer with only marginally more units because of zoning laws, I would now have a new construction free of current rent control rights.<p>The key here is to create legal mechanisms that make rent control rights a fungible commodity that can be traded. By making rent control rights fungible, you essentially decoupled the rent control from the physical structure, you create a way for the owners of the structures to be able to use the land under that structure for its highest and best use.<p>Furthermore, this approach is much more amiable than Ellis Act evictions since it gives rent control renters an out that is comparable to their current situation. Even more, it gives them the opportunity to move to a larger unit in case they&#x27;ve outgrown their current rent control place and would like to stay in the city to raise a family (e.g. someone with a 1-bedroom can requests offers for a two bedroom place at a comparable rate relative to their current living situation).",1395340834

Hack seems to mix the two styles, which seems like it would make code harder to read as things get more complex, like when functions accept other functions as arguments.<p>Am I reading the documentation right? And, if so, can you shed any light on the decision making process that went into this decision?",1395340386

I don&#x27;t.<p>You do. The first probe moves toward infinity. The second probe toward the singularity. They each move toward destinations beyond opposite sides of the LIF. Then, as measured in that LIF, they recede from each other. But you disagreed here:<p>> The second probe will move closer to the first probe (while they are both within the LIF);<p>Again, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to show that the probes approach each other in the skydiver&#x27;s frame, given the first probe moving toward higher r-coordinates and the second probe moving toward lower r-coordinates. You should be able to do that if you are correct.<p>> You keep on making this mistake even though I&#x27;ve repeatedly explained why it&#x27;s wrong, and even though you think you are not referring to r coordinates at all.<p>GR places additional conditions on what happens in a LIF, when it predicts that everything below a horizon falls toward the singularity. To be a falsifiable scientific theory we <i>must</i> be able to set up a thought experiment that accounts for that prediction within an LIF straddling the horizon. So what I do in that regard cannot be a mistake, as long as I&#x27;m careful that nothing is measured outside of the LIF. For example, it&#x27;s okay to have an experiment in an LIF that says &quot;fire a particle toward Vega&quot;, even though Vega is outside the LIF, as long as the measurements take place wholly within the LIF.",1395340371

Press the universal shortcut for italic (cmd-I) and you get italics, in the content and on the screen. And so on.<p>Markdown is a hack that works around two inconvenient truths. First, in-browser editing has traditionally been shitty. Second, for those working in a coding milieu, you can&#x27;t just type &#x27;less someasciifile.txt&#x27; and have it display with the right italics, bold and breaks.<p>If you&#x27;re a professional writer for print, none of this has bothered you since WordStar.

So now I wait for a couple of days before calling Insurance company to confirm.<p>For background, I submitted this application on March 11th,2014 which means that my coverage should be active April 1st,2014 (according to healthcare.gov rules [0]). But guess what, the insurance company tells me that my coverage has been activated effective Feb 14,2014. So now I owe them for Feb and March while I am double paying COBRA premium as well.<p>Big software glitch on their part OR a badly designed logic of some sort.<p>Fellow HN&#x27;ers, if you are not qualifying for the subsidy (most of us don&#x27;t anyway), please refrain from using healthcare.gov and go directly to the insurance company. There is no law that you have to buy using the exchange. I didn&#x27;t know that and was too stupid.

Sometimes we shared other binaries that had nothing to do with Gentoo per se.<p>In any case I never gave these people a written notice saying how to get the source, nor did I host the source for three years, nor did I share the source when I copied that binary to a place where a friend could grab it.

1204775,comment,1204505,1204505,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I don't think it's so much about lyrics (although instrumental music tends to be less popular in general). Nor is about musical ability. I'm only a mediocre musician, but I can appreciate musical structure very well and like to compose in unusual modalities, especially phrygian. I know far better musicians than myself who don't like jazz; meanwhile my Dad has a complete tin ear and couldn't carry a tune in a bucket, but he loves jazz despite having little or no musical knowledge. I can't stand it, but not because I think it's bad - I'm really impressed by the depth and skill of jazz musicians. I just can't take it in any significant quantity.<p>My problem with it is that I get frustrated by the fact that it isn't necessarily going anywhere - the exploratory and whimsical nature of it upsets me because it conflicts with my desire for structure and resolution. I think my Dad likes partly because of this; it doesn't demand that he model structure and tension, he's quite happy to just be a passenger and enjoy the musical scenery. This is not to say it <i>lacks</i> structure or harmonic tension. Harmony is the weakest part of my musical ability and I'm just not able to appreciate the relationships between complex chords and for that matter I'm not much good at polyrhythms either. Strangely, on occasions where someone has tried to get me more into jazz, if we agree in advance on a musical modality I am able to improvise reasonably well and we can have an extended musical 'conversation': it's easier for me to play than it is to listen to, or at least it was when I practiced on a more regular basis. But the emotions it arouses in me largely consist of 'Aaagh! Please stop fucking around and get to the point!!'.<p>Most commercial music is highly structured, both rhythmically and harmonically. Jazz reminds of those art projects where they make blank molds of some kind of sculpture and then hand them out to artists to decorate as they see fit, such that the shape of the sculpture is less important than the mix of color and pattern the artist wishes to explore, a 3-dimensional blank canvas if you like. Very often the results seem to have nothing to do with the shape, but I find myself thinking that if the shape is so unimportant, go paint a piece of canvas or something. I know these artists are saying something about deconstruction of the form by projecting things onto it which don't fit its obvious structure but I'm at a complete loss as to why you would choose a specific form if the primary thing you want to say is that form isn't important. Or maybe it's just that I find some such work innovative but have no patience for the ensuing horde of people copying the same idea and just doing so with their own favorite patterns and colors. It's like saying you feel liberated because you put on a straitjacket and then took it off again.<p>/handwaving",1269021454

1204771,comment,1204333,1204333,0,0,fnid2,,,"I went on a sales call yesterday to a small business in my little rural village. His current website was done by someone he knows and I talked to him 6 months ago about it and it hasn't changed, so I whipped up a demo and put it online and went to show him in his office.<p>When he started typing in the URL to the demo site, he was typing <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> into the yahoo search form.  I said, ""You should type it into the location bar.""<p>The what? he said.  Up there at the top I told him and pointed at it.  Whoa.<p>""Well, you know, my friend is building this one for me and ... ""  <i>This one</i> was a default wordpress install that had no customization except the header and footer and nothing at all close to what his business needs, yet he had to run my site by his friend, who I can tell has no idea how to write code or create a database.<p>How can any of us here ever expect someone like that to comprehend the difference between someone who can put up a web page and someone who can build an enterprise system with customer interaction, inventory management, and any sort of security whatsoever?<p>They can't.  Looking at a web page is like looking at the clothes someone is wearing and trying to figure out if they can do algebra.  Yet that's how they do it.  To 90% of people, maybe more, putting up a static web page or a word press site requires the same knowledge as understanding one-way hashes, caching, and parameterized queries.<p>And <i>yes</i>, I believe we should charge <i>a lot</i> more, but instead, we give away our software for free because it <i>feels</i> good.  I love open source, I create open source, I use open source, yet I know that open source isn't going to feed me.  It feeds some. It feeds the business guys who sell services on top of free open source systems. Those guys can't use a command-line, but they can pay programmers 10% of the deal, sometimes more. It feeds programmers who are lucky enough to work for a progressive employer who can afford to staff a team to support the project and defend it when it is stolen by a corporation and embedded in their set top boxes, but for those of us who want to create a path for ourselves, creating an open source project is like buying a lottery ticket.  Sometimes it works, Zimbra did well, word press does well, MySQL did well, but those are but a <i>tiny</i> fraction of the open source projects out there.  As long as we give away our work for free, why do we expect people to pay for it?<p>Outside the programming world, it is <i>completely</i> different. If a business person, a sales guy say, works for a technology company, they work on commission.  Sell one product, take 20-50% of the sale price.  If a programmer writes something that increases sales by 50% they get <i>nothing</i> additional.  No percentage increase, hardly a raise at most places.  Yet, code on.<p>Corporations simply <i>could not operate</i> without IT, yet it is considered a <i>cost center</i>, not a <i>profit enabler</i>, a <i>cost cutter</i>.  Imagine a human without a brain!<p>Yet, code on.  Why?  Because we love it.  Doesn't matter that sales guys also love to sell. CEO's also love to execute.<p>When I was a consultant, it angered me greatly that a sales man would win a client and while I was there, I would sell additional project after additional project, extending my time at the client and building more and more revenue for the company and I got a $5k raise the <i>next year</i>!  The sales guy got the same commission on the additional work <i>I</i> sold!  Why didn't I get the commission on the additional work?  Why didn't someone say, ""Awesome, you were at the client 5x longer than we expected and you doubled your expected billable hours for the year!""<p>Instead, the sales guy got a new flat screen TV.",1269021384

1204767,comment,1204505,1204505,0,0,dasil003,,,"I like the article and there's a lot of truth to it, but I have two critiques.<p>First, the music that people like is heavily based on familiarity.  People want one or two original elements in a song, but if the overall structure and composition of the song isn't following familiar patterns they will be unable to enjoy it.  This is why artists like Frank Zappa are more appreciated by musicians than the general public.  After repeated listenings, you find a lot of musical meat, which can then be broken down into more repetitive poppy elements.  Jazz in general is much the same, but even further away from pop music today than Zappa was.<p>The other critique is about the assertion that ""rap"" music is just about lyrics.  One of the foundations of hip-hop and something that sets it apart from other music throughout history, is that it is the first form of music to be built primarily from the manipulation of other recorded music.  And it does so in a way that maximizes the impact of the music via looping and sampling.  The degenerate form of hip-hop that is dominant today in the form of club music with banal hedonistic lyrics, autotuned vocals, and repetitive plain rhythmic styles is nothing more than familiarity breeding popularity.  However the art form of hip-hop is alive and well and still progressing (hopefully sampling can see a proper fair-use legitimization in court soon).",1269021297

It's the ""I'm an artiste, dammit"" attitude, the cleverness for cleverness' sake, the removal of anything remotely engaging at a visceral level -- the attempt to emulate in the jazz idiom what Schoenberg perpetrated on ""serious"" music -- that forces people to decide that the Emperor is without skivvies to cover his shame.<p>Lyrical content is a red herring as well. There's a lot of dance crap (and some that's not crap) that gets heavy rotation in the wider world that is entirely word-free.<p>Okay, jazz is all about painting oneself into a corner and finding imaginative ways of escaping the trap you've set for yourself, but there's no harm in playing something that manages to capture a tune along the way rather than merely tracking the letter of the changes.

I give them a confirmation and after some investigation I learn my ticket has been cancelled because the system deleted it. For a while I couldn't join Facebook because of my last name. During the registration process I was asked for my real name and when I wrote ""Fake"" it rejected me. Finally a friend working for Facebook took care of me.<p><a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/adam-penenberg/penenberg-post/flickr-co-founder-caterina-fake-value-viral-loops-exclusive-qa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/adam-penenberg/penenberg-pos...</a>",1269020837

There are easy counter examples, such as the popularity of instrumental dance music, which often features very little in the way of lyrics and the vapid nature of most pop songs, as well as the ability of many listeners to appreciate music performed in a language other than their own.<p>The problem with a lot of jazz, what I would call ""bad"" jazz, is that it is formless noodling.  It is in areas like jazz solos, jam rock bands, rock guitar solos, etc. that one hears the admirer comment on the difficultly level of the performance versus the coherent melodies and hooks of popular music, and even many popular classical works.<p>The popular jazz standards have melodic hooks that cause people to like and remember them.  Beyond that surface, a vast majority of jazz musicians are more focused on the intricacies of group performance than composition.  Sure more musical education, or better brains, would enable people to develop their memories to be able to recall and hum along with longer and more complex note sequences, but you still need to compose them- and repeat them.

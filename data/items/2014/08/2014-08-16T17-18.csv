I decided to take a year off after sophomore year to teach myself some web development and travel. I was originally planning to go back to university this Fall, but I am pursuing a career in modeling/showbiz. It has always been on my list of things I wanted to do, so I thought it would be better to do it now while I&#x27;m young rather than later when I have more obligations. My advice would be to go with whatever whim or dream you have, even if others might not agree.",1408211968

We&#x27;re looking forward to releasing the product and showing off all of our hard work!<p>Simone: Thanks for the congrats and all your help during and after techstars.<p>NnamdiJr: I did mention Xavier to the wsj--not sure why they didn&#x27;t include him in the article. Xavier has been working with us full time for close to a year now. Him and I have been good friends and collaborators for over 2 years now. It is true that Xavier was ranked #1 for a very long time. If it wasn&#x27;t for him taking time away from competitions to work on DataRobot, he may still be ranked #1. Owen, the current #1 ranked Data Scientist, worked with us at Travelers and I&#x27;ve known him and his wife for about 10 years now. Thus, I would say that so far we are recruiting from the intersection of our own network and the Kaggle leaderboard. That said, I think recruiting kaggle-proven data scientists is one of the best ways to ensure you hire a quality data scientist (although there are plenty of other factors that matter like real-world experience building and implementing predictive models).<p>acoyfellow: There are some startups using Datarobot. We have a cloud product for SMB&#x27;s and startups as well as an on-premise version for enterprise.<p>jawns and blauwbilgorgel: Sometimes I use &quot;Data Scientist&quot; and &quot;Statistician&quot; interchangeably, but I do think that stats is a subset of data science (I subscribe to Drew Conways venn diagram definition of a data scientist). I do know plenty of people who call themselves statisticians but actually meet all the criteria for being a data scientist. Regardless of what they call themselves, true data scientists are extremely rare.<p>If there are any true data scientists (by Drew Conway&#x27;s definition) that are interested in working with us, please send us an email at careers @ datarobot. We are also looking for great Python, Javascript, and Spark engineers. <a href=""http://www.datarobot.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datarobot.com/careers/</a>",1408211929

8186926,comment,8186200,8186778,7,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>&quot;I think there&#x27;s too much focus these days on what you can get for the money, and not what you can get.&quot;</i><p>Agree, but with the Leica T you&#x27;re not really getting much either. Even if it was priced at the same level as the prosumer Sony/Olympus/Fuji cameras it&#x27;s still a dud.<p>The body itself is immaculately crafted, that&#x27;s to be certain - I&#x27;ve actually held one and it feels great.<p>But the software sucks, the controls are awkward, the screen is mediocre, and basic functions of a camera like autofocus are slow. It&#x27;s a showpiece, not a workhorse, regardless of the price.<p>This isn&#x27;t the Ferrari everyone likes to compare Leicas to, it&#x27;s paying $300K for a Lada encrusted with diamonds.<p>I&#x27;m not above paying for good design and manufacturing, but it needs to hit the baseline of being a good camera first. I&#x27;d buy a Leica M (well, if I had more money) but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d touch either the T or the even-more-cash-grabby X-Vario.<p>For another example of style-over-substance camera (or really just style-without-substance), see the Hasselblad Lunar.",1408211898
8186925,comment,8186200,8186200,9,0,TheMagicHorsey,,,"Having used a great many different cameras what I think about Leicas is that their primary advantage is the state of mind they create in the photographer, which isn&#x27;t really connected to any tangible usability in design, or engineering marvel in the camera performance.<p>Just the fact that some photographers know they have a Leica in their hand, makes them feel more liberated and ... how shall I say it ... &quot;photographery&quot;.<p>I think it cannot be denied that with a suitable picture style, you could shoot JPEGs on a 5D MkIII that look similar to what a Leica produces without processing.  I bet you most people would be hard pressed to tell the difference between the JPEGs with their naked eye, and even fewer would be able to pick out which one was from the Leica, and which from the 5DMkIII.<p>Leicas remind me of French Wine.  Everyone waxes poetic about them until they are asked to pick out the Leica photos from a lineup in a double blind test.<p>At that point everyone then says the Leica is about intangible things like &quot;superior UI&quot;.<p>In the end, I think the Leica is a brand first, and then a camera with certain characteristics next.<p>A camera made from a solid carved piece of aluminum is just damn attractive.  But people feel the need to imbue the Leica with more qualities than it actually has, because maybe they feel embarrassed to have chosen the tool of their trade based on its looks, rather than its utility.<p>I for one think designers should not apologize for choosing a camera just because it looks good.  Design is their whole trade, and they need to surround themselves with inspiration to get into their creative space.<p>I look at Leica as the cost of doing business for a designer.  That is the way their brains work.<p>And lest programmers develop some superiority complex about their rationality ... I want to suggest that the success of the Go programming language is about aesthetics at this point.",1408211897

Challenge yourself in ways you wouldn&#x27;t even define as intellectually or mentally sharp. Thinking non-critically, social intelligence, group intelligence, for example.<p>Challenge yourself with concepts you find impossible or impenetrable to understand. I find when I do this, my desire to understand it increases by what seems like an infinite magnitude. When I have that much passion and motivation behind learning something, I am going to throw everything I&#x27;ve got at it. When I run out of every way I&#x27;m used to thinking, I have to force myself to find another way. This can be incredibly painful, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.<p>It is the kind of learning process that can completely flip the way I perceive everything, because I have realized over and over again, that for every way I had constructed as what I called &#x27;learning&#x27;, that element which ties them together biases them together. Even now, I realize that I make the assumption that bias is capable of being evaluated in a binary fashion. I don&#x27;t know what that means, but it&#x27;s a new thought.<p>Examine yourself carefully and slowly. It is a fine line to walk, between mental independence, and feeling mentally ill. The further out I go, the longer it seems to take me to come back. But I never know what going that far out is worth. Sometimes I feel lost entirely. Sometimes I feel sharp as knives. Sometimes I have to remind myself to stop thinking about how to control my thinking, so I can get back to studying the things I wanted to become proficient in, in the first place.",1408211810

The fact that the guy prepaid doesn&#x27;t really matter—Paypal accounts in particular are a breeding ground for stolen money/accounts.<p>My reading of this situation is that the person who wrote the article did something that got their account flagged as &quot;this looks like a spammer we previously kicked off our service&quot;, at which point the automatic system kicked in to ask him for a copy of an ID because it thought he was probably some Russian or Chinese scammer. Yes, there are false positives, but even at the best hosting companies, there&#x27;s a constant stream of foreign spammers and scammers. Constant. Like, multiple obvious questionable contacts per day for every single support/sales person on staff.<p>This is pretty much how it works at any major low-cost hosting company. EIG&#x27;s awful customer service system (which is centralized across all the companies they own) means that they take forever to process everything, but <i>any</i> hosting company with prices low enough to have to deal with mass fraud is going to have similar procedures. It&#x27;ll just at best (like it was at the company I worked for pre-acquisition) be somewhere where you can talk to a fraud specialist immediately on the phone, fax in a copy of an ID, and have your site back up in a half hour.<p>Also, of course the support person closed the chat.

Is there a separate transaction with your ISP for every packet you send or receive? I would have thought that the relevant business transaction occurred once per month, when I paid them $X to carry Y GB of data on my behalf (and similarly with phone companies). Anything more granular than that is an implementation detail of the service: sure, the ISP has the <i>ability</i> to observe and log the full header+data contents of any packets I send, and might even have good business reasons to do so, but it doesn&#x27;t follow (to me at least) that every packet I send through this connection is now a business transaction record over which I have no reasonable claim to privacy.<p>It&#x27;s clear that there are some forms of metadata (call records, packet destinations, etc) that are useful and perhaps necessary for service providers to observe and log, in the course of providing their services. But insofar as the privacy implications of releasing that data fall almost entirely on consumers, not on the service provider, it makes sense to give consumers some say over what happens to it. In this view, metadata really is &quot;my data&quot; in the sense that a service provider should have an obligation to protect it, analogous to medical records (which are records of &#x27;business transactions&#x27; with my doctor that they nonetheless have an obligation to protect) or documents provided to an attorney under attorney-client privilege.",1408210664

Let&#x27;s say this is for a normal biologically limited lifetime of 75 years. Using this as a basis, the Binomial Theorem shows that we have a probability of .000448 <i>per year</i> of dying of any one of these causes, and, for 75 years, this probability produces the quoted chance of 0.033 for any of these four causes. For longer lifetimes, this outcome means that:<p><pre><code>         Age  Probability\n    ----------------------\n          75       0.0330\n         100       0.0438\n         200       0.0857\n         500       0.2007\n        1000       0.3612\n        2000       0.5919\n        5000       0.8936\n</code></pre>\nThis outcome, for four common non-biological causes of death, means that <i>there is no &quot;indefinite lifespan&quot;</i> -- all that happens is the way we die changes.

This is a huge, often unstated caveat. It is very important to be able to read error messages and quickly locate the offending line in the literate source.<p>For languages that support file/line pragmas like C, literate programming works very well. Alternately, if the language supports goto and can sensibly unravel these statements, one can cobble a weave/tangle script to still have a 1-1 mapping between program and source line numbers.<p>Otherwise, I find that I need to program in a very functional style in order to force my tangled program to have the exact same line numbers as the literate source. This is possible, but it also negates the advantages of having natural language macro names, since they are essentially equivalent to the function names. In this case, tangle becomes an identity mapping.",1408209978

8186821,comment,8182991,8186251,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"Stochastic gradient descent is a &quot;crappy&quot; method that works. Theoretically, it ought to be slow to converge and often involves annoying tuning parameters because you want to slow learning with each iteration. In practice, though, it works quite well. Quite a large number of successful neural-net/deep-learning implementations use SGD rather than second-order (quasi-Newton) or even momentum methods.<p>Pointwise SGD tends to be uncommon and too noisy. Mini-batch sampling is more common. Each iteration, you train on a bootstrap subset (say, 10,000 points chosen with or without replacement from the full dataset). If you have less than 10k data points, you generally don&#x27;t need to use stochastic algorithms at all.<p><i>Does gradient descent apply to problems with many local extrema, or is it restricted to purely globally convex problems?</i><p>There are a variety of approaches:<p>* Multiple starting points. Often gets the job done and finds a good local minimum. The idea is that, usually, better (lower) local minimums will have larger drainage regions, a sort of &quot;deep is usually broad&quot; hypothesis that is often but not always true.<p>* Momentum. Instead of moving with a velocity proportionate to the gradient, it&#x27;s proportionate to a smoothed average of previous gradients. This makes it far less likely that you end up at a bad local minimum or some other stationary point (at a local maximum or saddlepoint, the gradient is zero).<p>* Other stochastic devices such as simulated annealing or (for neural nets) drop-out.<p>* Dimensionality reduction and regularization (weight decay) don&#x27;t necessarily solve the &quot;multiple local minima&quot; problem but often make the search space smaller and the problem, therefore, more tractable. (The main purpose of DR and regularization, however, is to improve generalization performance.)",1408209767

I fear that in our eagerness to make things more accessible we&#x27;re yet again making our field out to be somehow special enough to warrant that different treatment.<p>I&#x27;d much prefer that we treat it as &quot;this is how you solve a problem&quot;, or &quot;here&#x27;s a cool thing we can do&quot;, or anything that&#x27;s just more understated and chill than how we seem to go about it.<p>A special note about the &quot;making it more attractive to subpopulation X&quot;:<p>(I&#x27;m going to choose X = ciswomen, because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve got the most experience with)<p>Friend went to Chile and while there helped out at an &quot;introduce women to computing&quot; event, of the same sort he and I volunteer at here stateside. He reported (as memory serves) that the attitude there of the women was &quot;Oh, okay, new thingy, cool!&quot;, whereas at our events here it&#x27;s usually &quot;Oh, computers/programming isn&#x27;t really a girl thing, so we&#x27;re trying something foreign and maybe a little uncomfortable but fun&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve even seen--much to my chagrin!--women helpfully setting double-standards that serve to undermine their peers when new to the field.

I was quite flummoxed. The problem there was that she was giving her peers the mental out of &quot;Oh, another woman had problems with this--so, it&#x27;s okay if I have problems with it...it&#x27;s not expected of us anyways&quot;. It&#x27;s incredibly subtle and incredibly toxic.<p>By contrast, in Chile, my friend found that because the computers and internet and whatnot were (relatively) so new in their spread, <i>everybody</i> was considered a novice, and so there were a lot fewer gender boundaries inhibiting learning and exploration.<p>I am saddened everytime we present tech as something being new or novel or &quot;something to be made easy&quot; because I believe that in doing so we perpetuate the idea that programming has to be hard or that it is some sort of optional skill.

Why not save up and buy things that last. That bring joy to your life and enrich it. Why buy a three dollar Chinese screwdriver with an imprecisely cut point that strips every fifth screw, when for ten dollars you can get a precision cut, tempered, and coated american made screwdriver that feels weighty and good in your hands. That doesn&#x27;t strip those screws and makes your job a little more joyful.<p>America needs to bring back the craftsman and the appreciation for craftsmanship. The LVL1 hackerspace in Louisville just moved into an old factory and I am constantly stunned by the workmanship that went into that old building. The architect filled the place with light using angled windows, but it doesn&#x27;t get hot. Even the wood floors are beautifully made (and this was for factory work).<p>Surrounding yourself with crafted things allows you to think on a higher plane. You know what is possible because you are surrounded with it.<p>If you surround yourself with cheap replaceable junk you become capable of crafting and expecting only cheap replaceable junk. That&#x27;s why I can buy so much expensive furniture off craigslist for pennies.

Going from high school to college within the span of 3 months was a bit too quick for me so I requested for my admission to be deferred.<p>I now have a year to pursue the things that I want to pursue. The thing is apart from web development and developing Android apps, I don&#x27;t know what else to do. I just started a part-time job as a developer which has the option of becoming full time in the future. I should say I took the job mainly so I could gain experience for future purposes because I really want to be a software engineer but without experience, it&#x27;s kinda hard to be.<p>I know an existential crisis is inevitable. I was wondering what HN suggests I should do. People I&#x27;ve talked to said that I should travel but traveling is really enough for me. I have no idea what to do to be social.<p>So what do you suggest I do during my gap year HN?",1408208643

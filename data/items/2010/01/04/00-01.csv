It's all too common on highways that vehicles can't stop within a safe distance if the vehicle in front of it stops, which leads to 5 vehicle pile ups.<p>You'd only need a moderate percentage of vehicles with the radar/lidar technology to keep a highway reasonably spaced. EG if you're tailgating, your vehicle will brake, if someone is tailgating you it will speed you up (within the speed limit) to get you to a safe distance, or (when capable) shift you safely into a different lane when you're in cruise.<p>Eventually you could simply have vehicles communicate, so when the guy in front of me brakes, my vehicle gets instructed that it's approaching a decelerating object.

Don't remember his name, but it was a big deal.<p>AMD's culture is just different than Apple's.  For one, there are no ""secret teams"" like iPhone, iTablet, etc. (well, at least none that I knew about).  For another, developers have real autonomy to make business decisions, something that would never happen at Apple.  For instance, I, a lowly intern, redeployed software to the production line during an emergency.  If something went wrong, chips would actually stop rolling out of the factory.  I would imagine normal (non-senior) Apple engineers don't have that kind of autonomy.<p>The other major difference, which perhaps you caught above, is that AMD actually manufactures their own stuff.  So, not only are there US engineers, but engineers overseas in the plants that AMD owns, engineers in Dresden, etc.  Not to say that foreign engineers are somehow bad, but it is a lot harder to control leaks when you have engineers working literally 24/7 all around the world.  And at the scale that you're making your own stuff, there are just more people than there are at Apple, and things are way harder to control.  It's like herding cats.",1262565703

There is no difference between dual-licensed GPL code and straight-up GPL code. In both cases, your rights as an end-user are identical. In neither case can you pick up the codebase after it's sold to Sun and start a new commercial endeavor on it that <i>isn't</i> GPL'd.",1262564153

One system used by GM on the Corvette works by comparing the input from an inertial yaw sensor to the current steering-wheel angle.  Any disagreement results in selective application of braking at one or more wheels, as needed to make the two sensors agree.<p>Now: what happens when one of those sensors fails?  <a href=""http://forums.corvetteforum.com/c6-tech-performance/2336065-service-active-handling-consumer-action.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.corvetteforum.com/c6-tech-performance/2336065-...</a><p>I wish I could find the video I saw earlier, where a Z06 doing about 90 MPH did a hard right turn into the wall at a drag strip for no apparent reason.

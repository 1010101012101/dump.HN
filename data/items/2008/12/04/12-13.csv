It almost killed Perl, almost became a de facto standard as a dynamic scripting language, and so many people just fell in love with it.<p>What will actually kill Python is unjustified changes that break <i>all existing code</i>. Or, let's view it as a different language that's simply doomed like every other attempt to ""fix"" things that actually work.<p>It's that simple: fixing things that work is a waste of time.",1228394544

And the one time I paid for something with my Debit card, I was overcharged and essentially had no recourse.  When someone got a hold of my CC number somehow and started making charges, I called AMEX, gave them nothing beyond the <i>amounts of the charges</i> and they charged everyone back for me.<p>Oh, and I have over 40,000 Points on that card right now which means, since I've never paid any interest, AMEX is paying me to use their card.

I think this is a bad move, since many Python newbies will probably download Python 3.0 instead of 2.6, and then get frustrated when none of their 3rd-party packages work. python.org should keep Python 3.0 more hidden away for the time being to give time for the greater Python development community to migrate to 3.0.",1228392853

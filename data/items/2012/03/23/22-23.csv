It still amazes me how many people refuse to consider the fact that there are humans on the other end of the computer. Instead, a lot of these arguments turn into accusatory conspiracy theory threads, as though things changing is a sign of some ""secret plan"". Is it that hard to believe that a product team is just trying their darndest to create the best product they can? Sometimes they'll get it right, and sometimes they won't, but constructive feedback always goes further than angry fist shaking. There's something about feedback for products on the internet that brings out extreme paranoia in people, and I don't get why that is.",1332543469

3747755,comment,3746692,3747061,10,0,kingmanaz,,,"Tradeoffs are a sign of a false dilemma; rather than choosing one solution or another, use them all where they work best. This is where Unix got it right all those years ago; Unix isn't just a slightly more stable platform for running today's bloated and monolithic software, rather, it's an elegant system for connecting maintainably-small utilities. The shell glues said utilities together into programs. Such an approach combines the best of high and low level programming, reuse and specificity, tradition and novelty, etc.<p>I know shell isn't going to with this popularity contest, but a return to it is what's badly needed in CS today. Instead of attempting to recreate the shell in C# or Java's supplied libraries and subsequently becoming frustrated when interaction with the ""outside world"" is clumsily accomplished through an FFI pinhole, just use the shell as it was intended: as a lingua franca between utilities.<p>Write what requires prolog in prolog, what requires c in c, what requires awk in awk, etc. Use flat file databases such as starbase or /rdb and avoid data prisons such as MSSQL, Oracle, MySQL, etc. Make all of these utilities return sane return values and spit out JSON formatted output. Finally, tie it all together with shell. If you need a UI, code it as a thin layer in TCL/TK, python/pytk, ansi c/gtk, or, consider pdcurses, etc. Profile your program and find any weak links in the chain. Recode in a lower level language only when needed.<p>Programming doesn't have to be hard. As in speech, the more one says, the less one means.",1332543154

Scheduler is a free booking service to help merchants of the world organize appointments. It's free except for a link to Groupon-- the price of using the scheduler is awareness of the fact that you could run a Deal or Now! deal with a few clicks and a phone call.<p>Considering that Groupon spent so much of their engineering talent on Scheduler, it's easy to see how a company with universal small business appeal like Fee Fighters in it's current form (give or take a few reminder links) becomes super desirable to Groupon.",1332541924

3747623,comment,3746732,3746732,1,0,dr_,,,"Things will start to change soon, there are some signs of this already. \nHealthcare remains heavily regulated, and because of this even for profit institutions are sometimes run as government institutions. This is most apparent in nursing facilities. Medicare is the predominant payor, and there's no reason for any facility to go beyond what medicare requires. Why invest in electronic records, etc? if medicare doesn't require it (although that's changing now). It's just an added expense.<p>But it's become apparent to policy makers that Medicare is getting more and more expensive, and some type of change is going to have be initiated. \nWith private health insurance, it's the same picture. Costs are going up and more of these costs are being shifted to the insured (patients). Deductibles have gone up tremendously, and the days of the $5-$10 co-pay are almost gone.<p>The solution, in both cases although perhaps implemented in different ways, is going to have require the patient/insured to be responsible for paying for themselves directly. On the surface, it seems like a bad thing, but in the longer run it's a good thing. It brings into play what healthcare has been lacking - market forces. \nAlmost all other industries have market forces in play, but not so much in healthcare. Go to a great surgeon, or go to an average one, they get paid the same. Why? It shouldn't be that way.<p>But once people have to pay more out of their own pocket, they are going to be far more careful about who they see. The level of service provided is going to matter. Ease of access is going to matter. Outcomes are going to matter. How about a refund if certain things don't turn out as promised?<p>And that's where there is going to be tremendous opportunities for startups. To provide technology for patients, and for doctors, hospitals, etc to provide a better level of service. All parties involved will be actively looking for these tools at some point.<p>Granted there are some regulatory hurdles, and HIPAA was really a poorly thought out piece of legislation, but as the startup community grows, there will be tools made available to navigate these hurdles as well.",1332540852

They have the credit card processing and the relationships with local businesses.  ""Are you enthusiastic about selling online?

I mean, FeeFighters might be profitable and a good business, but if it doesn't tie-in nicely to one of Groupon's current or future businesses, it might not be a good purchase.  So, I think we all expect something is going to happen - something to leverage a collective strength rather than basically being two separate companies with separate revenue and separate customers just jointly owned.<p>I think there's a reason why some might be worried.  When a company gets acquired, sometimes that product gets discontinued (even if claims are made otherwise during the acquisition).  Othertimes, the product languishes.  Hopefully that won't be the case here, but it's hardly unheard of.  Heck, even without a merger, directions can change.  I remember when Heroku had a web editing interface and they gave that up well before being bought.  But when an acquisition happens, sometimes new combinations of people lead to new ideas and the old ideas don't seem as exciting (or as likely to be useful/profitable).  The acquiring company may think they will continue the acquired property, but six months later it becomes clear that they want to spend their resources elsewhere.  I'm not saying that will happen - in fact, Heroku's purchase by Salesforce is a perfect contradiction as it has done wonderful things since acquisition.  However, Jaiku, FeedBurner, Dodgeball, Gizmo5, DimDim, and others all show that a product can be discontinued or languish in a state that feels like no one is looking at it after an acquisition.<p>I guess if there was some announcement of ""everyone, we're working on a new way to get local businesses online easily with FeeFighters credit card processing"" we'd all feel like ""nice!  I can see how that would fit well and will continue to be an awesome, actively developed product.""

It is incredibly difficult to build a runtime like .NET, especially as it was never designed to be cross-platform.<p>That said, the Mono experience on Linux is inferior to that on Windows. MonoDevelop is nowhere near Visual Studio, so that I just develop on Windows and deploy on Linux. Unfortunately, that doesn't help the fact that both the soft and hard debuggers for Linux are nowhere near Microsoft's debuggers.  It also doesn't help the fact that the runtime itself is less stable (i.e., more prone to crash) and there are APIs that only work well on Windows. I would also imagine that the Microsoft runtime exhibits much better overall performance.<p>My understanding is that Mono mainly excels at MonoTouch, and that is where Xamarin is making most of its money, but I am not knowledgeable in that area.",1332540056

I also read a good chunk of Tomcat. Sun had this grand vision of App servers which you could just push code to and it would run completely isolated. The app servers where supposed to be spec compliant meaning your app could run on any implementation. But, and this is what bit the company I was working for, all of the implementations add lots of non-standard bits and broke standard bits. This meant that if you had written your app to go on WebSphere there was essentially no way it was going to run on TomCat without modification.<p>If Sun had more tightly controlled the marketplace for these things I think the whole ecosystem would have been more robust.",1438822733

Sure. In that regard, I&#x27;m trying something in order to help in the case of C, but it is not intended specifically for the problem we&#x27;re speaking (just strings and other data structures, not a &quot;NodeJS for C&quot;): <a href=""https://github.com/faragon/libsrt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/faragon/libsrt</a><p>> I concur C++ should be able to, but I again request large scale examples, because I&#x27;ve never seen any. Have you?<p>Of course not. There were many years ago when servers were way slower than today. The problem is not solved for current web, obviously. &quot;Solved&quot;, in the sense of having some framework for having low level stuff in the backend without doing a byzantine effort. The point is about how to break monopolies in the David vs Goliath sense. If you have the resources, go high level.<p>> You have to define your terms. Is Lua high or low level? Well written Lua code that does not need millions of small objects seems to run to within x2 as slow as comparable C code when executed through LuaJIT2. I&#x27;ve seen well written Perl beat well written C in the past (the Perl was better written, but both were well written).<p>Please note that I was speaking about extreme optimization, even avoiding filesystem I/O, and reducing memory copies to the minimum. So it is not about comparing C vs Perl doing disk I/O, but in pure calculous. High level languages, even using JIT, have an important data structure size overhead and also allocation issues (when handling 10^5-10^6 requests per second on a single thread), so even with properly optimized code you can have poor performance in comparison to low level languages with optimized data structures (e.g. libraries using low level data structures using indexes instead pointers, multiplexing buffers, allowing memory aliasing for allowing conversions in the same buffer, etc.).<p>> With a language that so easily lets you shoot yourself in the foot like C or C++, this is not the case in practice, see, e.g., every C program ever written. Can you give the examples you&#x27;re thinking of so we can discuss them?<p>Write backends in C/C++ is nonsense, unless you want to handle 10-100x requests using same hardware. If your service allows to cover the expense, go high level. Of course :-)<p>P.S. some low level backend stuff:<p>Kore: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9558196"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9558196</a><p>Rwasa: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9948749"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9948749</a><p>Redis: <a href=""https://github.com/antirez/redis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/antirez/redis</a>  (e.g. changing it in order to call the DB operations directly from same-process, without doing connections)",1438822637

However, a real test of Go&#x27;s safety and efficiency would be a comparison to a similar language such as an optimized Wirth language, a subset of Free Pascal (Delphi-style), typed LISP (eg Racket), Julia, or Ada.

The hard part was canceling the service and getting them to stop billing you once you stopped using their service.<p>AOL software grew and went on CD-ROMs, at least with floppies you could reformat them and use them for other stuff, the CD-ROMs were drink coasters and made wind mobiles out of them.<p>AOL software grew when they merged with Time Warner, the AOL software was a web browser and media surfer and email client.<p>When broadband began to take over there was a $20/month option to add in your AOL account to it and use it over broadband.<p>If you want AOL 2.0 today you have to have a phone company or cable company bundle their broadband service with the software that is part web browser, chat client, email reader, news reader, media surfer, stock ticker, and other stuff rolled into one app.<p>Google or Apple if they wanted to do this would have to lay down some fiber optics to provide broadband Internet access and then bundle their AOL 2.0 software with it. It is not a cheap thing to do, the dial-up modem was better because you could plug a modem into any phone line and get Internet, but it was slow. Today you need a high speed phone line and a DSL modem, cable modem, some sort of high speed modem that uses fiber optic, etc. They company has to send someone to install the high speed cable and modem to hook you up, and it is not so easy to do that these days. You have to wait for someone to be available to do that, and hope there is no technical delays.<p>AOL was killed by broadband Internet and Web 2.0 sites replacing what AOL software did.<p>Oddly enough you still find the elderly using AOL dial-up for $35/month on really old Windows PCs.

10013964,comment,10013016,10013609,0,0,boona,,,"When economists state that actors are rational, all they are is saying is that people act purposefully. Whether you water your plants, or pray to the magic unicorn in your closet for rain, both actions are purposeful, though both may not have the same result.<p>You are correct when you say that individuals are &quot;moving far too slowly&quot; with regards to anthropomorphic climate change, but that&#x27;s rational since it makes virtually no difference if you, as an individual, change your habits and produce less pollution. Nothing you do will change the outcome. This is similar to voting, where most people don&#x27;t vote because in the US national election, you have a much greater chance of dying on the way to the voting booth, than affecting the outcome of the election. It&#x27;s irrational for an individual to vote (unless they&#x27;re doing so to demonstrate to those around them what their values are).<p>Now, a libertarian might say that economic freedom is not utopic, there are plenty of market failures. However, if one looks at a situation of economic freedom, and decides that the incentives in place are sub-optimal and don&#x27;t produce favorable results, it&#x27;s usually suggested that government should step in and regulate somehow. Individuals in government are however, made up of the same rational actors as those in the free market. So while more mainstream economists may end their analysts there, public choice theorists on the other hand demand a more consistent application of economic principles. Namely, they want to know what incentives are in place for individuals in government, and if those incentives will provide better or worse outcomes than a situation of economic freedom. If you&#x27;re interested, here is a short 10 minute video by Mark Pennington where he introduces this form of analysis i.e. Public Choice Theory.<p>Edit: I might be useful to include the link. :/ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAbDrP7whqw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAbDrP7whqw</a>",1438822027

Numerous people have pointed out that SRS exists solely to annoy other redditors. People posted numerous detailed documentation of SRS brigading, doxxing, and harassing people. As Spez tried to clarify the new policies, specifically to explain the justification for the bannings, many people pointed out most of his justifications applied to SRS. Spez has pretty much ignored those comments. I believe the last time he commented on SRS was in an earlier thread where he said they know about the brigading, but they want to stop it with technical means rather than banning.<p>Looks like there is still a lot of work ahead for Reddit.",1438821646

Focusing exclusively on behaviors and not on deeply rooted systems strikes victims of those  unjust systems as a form of  moral evasion. If you&#x27;re not a  committed to preserving and propagating racist systems, then you shouldn&#x27;t have any problem changing the definition to one that  everybody can agree on . And if you <i>do</i> have a problem  with an insufficient definition…well, then maybe you&#x27;re a part of the larger problem the people are now addressing.<p>One more thought on definitions; remember that the US Constitution used to define black people as 3/5th of a human being for purposes of calculating the size of congressional delegations and 0/5th for everything else. The point here is prevailing definitions encapsulate broader social conventions.

But they didn&#x27;t know how hard it was to build a bomb, and if it had worked, either country probably could have negotiated a ceasefire immediately. Furthermore, Japan could have theoretically held out a lot longer than August 1945 due to its extremely defensible position.

For example, Storm does not attempt to handle concerns like resource rebalancing, contention management, or auto-scaling. It has a simple REBALANCE command, but this amounts to killing all your workers and randomly redistributing them in your cluster. It isn&#x27;t a smart rebalancer based on load or throughput, or anything.<p>My understanding is that Twitter&#x27;s rewrite of Storm (Heron) was mainly to make it work with Mesos as a resource manager. This is probably wise since Mesos handles a lot of the concerns I described above. But Mesos didn&#x27;t really exist when Storm was written.<p>They chose to re-implement 100% of Storm&#x27;s API in doing so, which perhaps shows that the high level concept of the framework has staying power even though you might benefit from a more advanced resource manager at 1,000-node scale. I wish they had reimplemented it as a competing implementation and <i>actually released it as open source</i>. But no, they decided to keep it 100% proprietary. So it goes. I guess once companies become a certain size, they turn their back on open source if it&#x27;s not directly in their interest any longer.<p>We run it with 10-15 Storm nodes with 32 cores each and find it to be immensely helpful in this context, keeping each node in the cluster lit up to ~60% CPU utilization and plowing through 10K events/second on a Kafka topic, despite the fact that we are using Python and there isn&#x27;t a line of code using threads or process management. People are often shocked we pull this off, since, in theory, CPython&#x27;s GIL means you can&#x27;t even run on more than one <i>core</i> at a time. But we write simple Python programs that run on Storm and utilize hundreds of cores at once, across multiple machines. And we get the Erlang-style &quot;let it crash&quot; / &quot;fail fast&quot; process supervision for free.<p>I have a more cynical view of the Heron paper overall -- if you&#x27;re curious about that, reach out to me directly (@amontalenti on Twitter).",1438820508

As long as we are doing that, we might as well at the same record a log of those syscalls which we can replay later. Then once a divergent syscall happens, we dump the state of memory. Later, we can restore the memory and replay the syscalls to reproduce an identical starting process.<p>CRIU has no concept of divergence. CRIU takes an already-running process with arbitrary state and snapshots it whole.<p>CRIU&#x27;s problem is actually orders of magnitude more complicated than snappy-start&#x27;s: it needs to understand <i>every</i> possible file descriptor type that the process could have open, every aspect of process state, etc. snappy-start only needs to understand the specific syscalls that we care to implement; it can simply consider any call it doesn&#x27;t recognize as divergent, and stop there. Adding support for more syscalls is then merely an optimization.<p>CRIU also requires special kernel features to support, which means more attack surface. Sandstorm wants to block everything except the most common kernel APIs for security reasons. snappy-start requires no new kernel features; it uses the well-understood APIs debuggers use, and we know we can still prohibit apps themselves from using those APIs.<p>Meanwhile, CRIU is much harder to customize. How would we decide when to do the snapshot? We&#x27;d have to re-implement much of snappy-start just for that purpose.

We advocate a specific policy, the carbon fee and dividend, where a scientifically-set price is levied per ton of CO2 at point of source, and all resulting revenue is distributed as a yearly check to individuals.  Naturally, a price on carbon means carbon-intensive goods cost more, which is the point: to alter consumer behavior at the point of purchase disfavoring carbon-intensive goods.<p>These campaigns, like Oregon Climate and Carbon WA, operate on shoestring budgets, so if anyone can throw coin our way, it would be greatly appreciated.

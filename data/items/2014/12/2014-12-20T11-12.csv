I&#x27;m pretty sure making the movie wasn&#x27;t about the hate against NK per se, but rather a comedy about the situation in an oppressed country.<p>If you burn a koran/bible I&#x27;m pretty sure we all know what that means: You hate the religion and wan&#x27;t it to die.<p>As you can see the difference is that the first one falls under free- and the other under hate-speech.<p>Now if you ask me, it&#x27;s still wrong to hate against those who burn &quot;holy books&quot; or whatever. In my opinion hate speech is integral to having free spech, even if it should be watched carefully (I really don&#x27;t wan&#x27;t a third reich here in germany) - something that has been lost in the past couple years.

It seems to me that designers really wanted to make it nice from a PL theory perspective, (hence the focus on functional programming and a strong type system).<p>Do you have any alternatives to implementing a strong type system in order to give certain well-defined safety guarantees for anyone using the language? Any other alternative theories or implementation strategies that would be better?<p>>  I&#x27;m more partial to the Go style of language design, which focused on making it easy to do the things the designers did in practice.<p>The designers/implementers wrote the first non-bootstrapped compiler in OCaml, a functional language. How&#x27;s that for &quot;things the designers did in practice&quot;?<p>As far as doing what they were doing in systems programming in practice: the point of the project is to actually get away from their then heavy use of unsafe languages like C++.

It&#x27;s a tyrannical dictatorship that has earned its spot as, quite literally, the worst place on earth. The Kim family has spent decades systematically programming the North Korean people as part of a system that follows in the tradition of such evil as Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, and Pasha. Concerning yourself with Kim&#x27;s feelings is the height of ignorance and folly: he certainly doesn&#x27;t concern himself with the millions who have died at his family&#x27;s hands by, in NK concentration camps, and through preventable famine.<p>Interestingly enough, The Interview never actually hurt the feelings of the North Korean people. In order to do that, they&#x27;d have to learn about it first.

But, I believe policing accounts for a significant portion of that disparity between the US and other developed, democratic-ish, nations.<p>Here&#x27;s why I believe that: Black folks are arrested at a rate of 2.5 times, or more, that of white folks, despite committing crimes at about the same rate as white folks (actually, for some classes of crime, such as marijuana use, whites commit crime at a higher rate). This tells me that police exercise discretion when making arrests. And, were they to exercise that discretion equally across races, there would be either a lot fewer or a lot more arrests, and a lot fewer or a lot more people being imprisoned.<p>In short, to put it into language that HN folks will understand, it is like a sales funnel. Police are an early stage in the funnel for filling prisons, and every stage in the funnel plays a role in the prison industrial complex.<p>Sources on the 2.5, or higher, number (any time race comes up as a factor, someone will challenge it...so, preemptive response):<p><a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/176915/scandal-racist-marijuana-arrests-and-what-do-about-it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thenation.com/article/176915/scandal-racist-marij...</a><p><a href=""http://atlantablackstar.com/2014/11/20/usa-today-finds-black-people-arrested-us-much-higher-rates-whites-paper-wont-call-racism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://atlantablackstar.com/2014/11/20/usa-today-finds-black...</a><p><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/05/us/us-race-marijuana-arrests/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/05/us/us-race-marijuana-arrests/i...</a><p><a href=""http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/03/02/us-drug-arrests-skewed-race"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/03/02/us-drug-arrests-skewed-ra...</a>",1419074172

        pll_std_capture_time
  Minimum:
        2.000e+01
  Maximum:
        1.000e+06
  Default:
        3.000e+02
  Description:
        Capture time before stiffning PLL.

        After this many seconds, the PLL will start to stiffen the P
        and I terms to gain noise immunity.  Decreasing risks that
        initial frequency capture is not finished, which will increase
        the offset-excursion.  Increasing just delays this stiffning.

  Failure: Stopping after parameter query.

8776366,comment,8776133,8776334,0,0,briandear,,,"An attack, a malicious attack by a state actor, is an attack, cyber or otherwise. What if they hacked a hospital and somehow shut down life support systems, there&#x27;s little moral difference than if they sent soldiers into the hospital. Whether we like it being framed militarily or not, this IS a military issue (if it&#x27;s a state actor) as that&#x27;s the point of the military to defend life liberty and property. However, that being said, this whole situation feels like a false flag to me, so I would suggest a highly considered response. If it is, in fact NK, then a military response is appropriate -- sanctions haven&#x27;t done a damned thing ever. I am not suggesting carpet bombing the country, but certainly their must be real consequences -- otherwise what&#x27;s the disincentive to do it again? However, I must reiterate, this smells like a wag the dog or a Gulf of Tonkin type situation. So I honestly feel like the best response now is no response until there is more information. Ultimately though, it&#x27;s potentially a disgruntled employee, in which case it&#x27;s a criminal matter as opposed to a national security one.",1419073790

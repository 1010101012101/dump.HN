    true == !Foo::bar()

Paamayim Nekudotayim is the best option, you could even use it as a prefix in case of ambiguity:<p><pre><code>    true == ::Foo::bar()</code></pre>",1225022046

344220,comment,343693,344068,0,0,ovi256,,,"I downvoted you because I know you (and the Economist) are wrong. I'm in Paris, and I've seen downsizing at a startup. They've fired dozens of people with a week's notice, and 2 or 3 months severance pay, AS PER their contracts.<p>It's NOT THE LAW that imposes this (the law imposes <i>nil</i> severance), but the contracts - they had this clause. Furthermore, severance pay is only due for termination that is outside the employee's control. That is, if the employer downsizes.<p>If you don't come to work or hit you boss, you can be fired INSTANTLY with NO severence pay - like anywhere in the world. This is rare however, I've seen it only once for supposedly sub-par performance.",1225021683

344212,comment,344198,344198,0,0,kaens,,,"This decision, and all the crap surrounding it - the decision making process, the reasons given for deciding on '\', etc - sum up very well why I do not like working with PHP.<p>It's not that I can't get stuff done with it. It's that it is designed and maintained by people who <i>don't know very much about language design</i>, coupled with the fact that PHP is in position to have some people that <i>are</i> experienced with such things come in and re-do it.<p>I mean, I'm far from being versed in the ways of writing programming languages, but I can write a parser that can handle one token being used for different things if I need to. I would think that it's a pretty common thing (and is probably in the class of things where you'd rarely be writing one from scratch, but I digress).<p>Every time I use it, I end up feeling like I'm beating my face against the language. That's not quite accurate - I end up feeling like I'm beating my face against <i>years</i> of poorly thought out design decisions with little to no effort made to remove them.<p>Perhaps I'm missing out on some things that make this a lot harder for PHP, especially considering that I'm not part of the PHP community (and considering that I avoid it when possible) - but it really seems to me that most of PHPs problems, from a language perspective, are <i>solved</i> problems.",1225020420

344206,comment,344198,344198,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"They should have stuck with Paamayim Nekudotayim for the namespace and either 1) returned an error for ambiguities or 2) used some prefix for namespaces like !Foo::bar().<p>1) is less desirable because unlike C++ PHP is not compiled.  I could imagine some random included file that you disabled for testing causing an ambiguity error.<p>2) could work if you choose a representation that is human readable and easily parsable.  The exclamation point seems to fit that description.",1225018832

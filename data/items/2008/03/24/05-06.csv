144367,comment,144303,144303,0,0,startingup,,,"This is a great post. A much more balanced perspective. I worked at a large well-known company, and I actually enjoyed it quite a bit there and learned a lot of engineering. My leaving had almost nothing to do with them - I had to relocate for personal/family reasons, and I combined it with starting up. I have been reasonably successful, though I started for the ""wrong reasons"". I actually was sad to leave that bigCo.<p>I still have gifted friends ""over there"" and they are quite happy, seem to enjoy what they do, and have no intention of leaving. From a purely technical perspective, I have to say they have done some really interesting work - more than I can say about my own technical work. I have learned other things like product management, sales & marketing.<p>Keep in mind what kinds of innovations that Bell Labs & IBM Research & Xerox Parc (my bigCo was like them in a way) produced during the few decades of their high point. The foundations of this industry were laid in those places, and they were all huge companies.",1206338349

144365,comment,144321,144352,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>I know lots of people</i><p>Just wondering--do you <i>really</i> know ""lots of people"" who are among the ""working poor""?<p>I come from Appalachia and have known--genuinely, no bullshit here--lots of ""working poor"" and can't honestly say that there was some systematic conspiracy to hold them down, rough them up, prevent them from rising, etc.<p>Fact is: There are a lot of people living in the lap of luxury--luxury measured by creature comforts--who in any other age would be <i>lucky</i>, yes <i>lucky</i>, to spend 12 hours a day behind a horse's ass.<p>The real reason for people staying in the lower ranks is exactly what we already know: They have some dysfunction. Perhaps a lack of intelligence, or an excess of impulse, or simply a chronic inability to show up to work on time. The latter might suprise you, as it hardly matters if programmers get up at 8 or 9 or 10, but in low-end jobs, one of the big problems among ""trouble employees"" is simply their unwillingness to follow a schedule. Who's to blame?",1206338040

The history of slavery should be ample proof of that.<p>It's one thing to say that ""We should ask what are the causes of wealth and try to recreate and reproduce them.""  It's another thing entirely to deny that there are no structural, sociological barriers to escaping poverty.",1206337114

144355,comment,144221,144277,0,0,startingup,,,"""The black family"" refers to the typical black family. Given the number of kids born out of wedlock quoted in the article (71% of all black kids) this is a sound characterization. ""The black family"" does not mean ""all black families"" but only the average or median one.<p>Sort of like the statement ""the American middle-class family does not save enough for retirement"" - again likely true in the average or median case.",1206336811

144340,comment,144303,144334,0,0,randomhack,,,"Well in some sense perhaps .. you can also say working your ass off is like becoming ""caged in work"". The question really is what is more important to YOU. If doing excellent technical work or making money is your first priority, then if you are working in a megacorp, then one can say you are caged. On the other hand, spending time with your family or watching movies or travelling are important to you, startup life is a cage for you and you will feel ""trapped"" by work.<p>The definition of caged seems relative.",1206334802

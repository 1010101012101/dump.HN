7187720,comment,7184013,7186499,1,0,knappador,,,"Roles are mixed in Django almost without exception.  I blame this on the fact that you want to make changes to M, V, and C during a UI interaction while usually only one URL gets called, and so the view updates the M, V, and C.  It&#x27;s like having a layer cake to keep things separate and then cutting it from the top into pie-slices.  Sure it makes sense somewhat, but each slice now contains every layer.  That is typical web programming.<p>Unless you&#x27;re using class-based views or Meteor etc AND hybrid-style API&#x27;s, things aren&#x27;t even beginning to resemble application programming with a separate network aspect to the application.  These days I&#x27;d just about rather print HTML/CSS onto paper so I can at least burn it.  The whole web-standards movement never grasped me as egalitarian or a good way to get FOSS into closed platforms.  I know there are supporters to web, but basically I view web as pretty limited in spite of all the work that&#x27;s been done with it.<p>Templates in Django are nothing that I would call views in application programming.  If I use data binding to hook up my controller state (in some way a wrapper around the model), then this has nothing to do with the M, V, or T in Django.  It&#x27;s a js object and not part of Django at all.<p>Templates <i>are</i> a decent way to somewhat modularize HTML/CSS without falling back to generating HTML/CSS from objects and giant data-structures, which would be torture.

7187700,comment,7185887,7185887,2,0,jroesch,,,"I think it is a little disingenuous to say that algorithms get buried in academic literature and are <i>impossible</i> to find. By the nature of research most of these things are made public when published, often times there is no implementation or just a research quality one (which I can guarantee you is almost never useful for the &quot;real world&quot;).<p>For example one day I was interested in implementing HyperLogLog(a set cardinality measure that is useful in data analysis). In about 10m I had all the relevant papers on hand and after skimming them I had a pretty good sense of how to implement it.<p>Similarly if I want to know how to implement a program dependency graph for doing program analysis I can go read a few pages of a paper and get a good description on the algorithm I would need to construct such a thing. I can believe the argument that some of these things are poorly indexed but even a bare minimum of Google searching usually results in useful algorithms. I would argue that often times many of these research algorithms have a bunch of different design decisions that are best explored in the academic literature around them, and an implementation and a few notes is not sufficient exploration.<p>For example I was recently implementing Paxos and there were <i>tons</i> of little details to be extracted from the papers around that had a big impact on the actual implementation we ended up with. The &#x27;Paxos Made Live&#x27; paper from Google had many details that were only relevant/true because of engineering decisions made by the team. If one was presented you with an implementation derived solely from that paper there are multiple incorrect assumptions you could derive.<p>An instance of this is made apparent in Paxos Made Live. Google essentially fixes their proposer because the have used Google specific details about the number of participants and their availability. The result is that they direct <i>all</i> traffic to a single node, and don&#x27;t spend a much time talking about leader/proposer selection (which could be useful to <i>your</i> needs).<p>I also don&#x27;t buy that an important part is getting the algorithms running as a service. Most so called &quot;algorithms&quot; are nothing more than a subroutine that is need as a piece of a greater whole. I would venture most useful &quot;algorithms&quot; are most likely container data structures and algorithms that operate over them. It seems that these are probably most useful to have as a library. Many libraries have already taken this approach LLVM (algorithms for code generation, albeit not always everything you want), OpenCV for computer vision routines, BLAS for linear algebra, NLOpt for non-linear optimization, and I&#x27;m sure one could come up with many more examples of democratized algorithms.",1391644303

For example with the right kernel configuration, this approach leaves the parent machine vulnerable to the recent x86_32 vulnerability (<a href=""http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/187"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/187</a>) and many similar bugs in its class.<p>The algorithms in the running kernel are far more exposed too - instead of managing a single process+virtual network+memory area, all the child&#x27;s resources are represented concretely in the host kernel, including its filesystem. For example, this vastly increases the likelihood that a child could trigger an unpatched DoS in the host, e.g. the directory hashing attacks that have effected nearly every filesystem implementation at some point (including btrfs as recently as 2012).<p>The containers code in Linux is also so new that trivial security bugs are being found in it all the time – particularly in sysfs and procfs. I don&#x27;t have a link right now, though LWN wrote about one a few weeks back.<p>While virtual machines are no security panacea, they diverge in what classes of bugs they can be affected by. Recent Qemu/libvirt supports running under seccomp.. ensuring even if the VM emulator is compromised, the host kernel&#x27;s exposure remains drastically limited. Unlike qemu, you simply can&#x27;t apply seccomp to a container without massively reducing its usefulness, or using a seccomp policy so liberal that it becomes impotent.<p>You could use seccomp with Docker by nesting it within a VM, but at that point Docker loses most of its value (and could be trivially replaced by a shell script with a cute UI).<p>Finally when a bug is discovered and needs to be patched, or a machine needs to be taken out of service, there is presently no easy way to live-migrate a container to another machine. The most recent attempt (out of I think 3 or 4 now) to add this ability to Linux appears to have stalled completely.<p>As a neat system for managing dev environments locally, it sounds great. As a boundary between mutually untrusted pieces of code, there are far better solutions, especially when the material difference in approaches amounts to a few seconds of your life at best, and somewhere south of 100mb in RAM.",1391643818

In fact, Web Audio is worse for playback of JS-synthesized audio, not better. And lots of use cases demand playback of JS-synthesized audio: emulators, custom audio codecs, synths, etc.<p>Generating audio samples via JS is an escape hatch, the same way rasterizing to a raw framebuffer is an escape hatch. If your system had audio acceleration hardware, and many systems do (e.g. DirectSound/OpenAL), you want to leverage that.<p>If you are deploying a game to a mobile device, the last thing you want to do is waste CPU cycles burning JS to do DSP effects in software. This is especially awful for low end phones like the ones that Firefox OS runs on. Latency on audio is already terrible, you don&#x27;t want the browser UI event loop involved IMHO in processing it to feed it. Maybe if you had speced it being available to Web Workers without needing the UI thread involved it would make more sense.<p>>The Web Audio API introduced an interconnected web of dozens of poorly tested, poorly specified components that covered some arbitrary subset of cases users care about<p>The arbitrary subset being, those that have been on OSX for years? AFAIK, Chris Rogers developed Web Audio based on years of experience working on Core Audio at Apple, and therefore, at minimum, it represents at least some feedback from the use cases of the professional audio market, at the very least, Apple&#x27;s own products like Garage Band and Logic Express which sit atop Core Audio.<p>You assert that the other use cases could have been handled by just extending existing APIs, but to me this argument sounds like the following:<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve just dumped this massively complex WebGL API on us, it has hundreds of untested functions. It would be better to just have <canvas> or <img> with a raw array that you manipulate with JS. Any other functions could be done [hand-wave] by just bolting on additional higher level apis. Like, if you want to draw a polygon, we&#x27;d add that.&quot;<p>APIs like Core Audio, Direct Sound, OpenGL have evolved because of low level optimization to match the API to what the hardware can accelerate efficiently. In many cases, bidirectional, so that HW influences the API and vice-versa. Putting the burden on the WG to reinvent what has already been done for years is the wrong way to go about it. Audio is a solved problem outside JS, all that was needed was good idiomatic bindings for either Core Audio, OpenAL, or DirectSound.<p>Whenever I see these threads on HN, I always get a sense of a big dose of NIH from Mozilla. Whenever anyone else proposes a spec, there&#x27;s always a complaint about complexity, like Republicans complaining about laws because they are too long, when in reality, they don&#x27;t like them either for ideological reasons, or political ones.<p>Mozilla is trying to build a web-based platform for competing with native apps. You can see it in asm.js and Firefox OS. And they are not going to get there if they shy away from doing the right things because they are complex. Mobile devices need all the hardware acceleration they can get, and specing out a solution that requires JS to do DSP sound processing is just an egregious waste of battery life and cycles IMHO for a low end web-OS based mobile HW.",1391643789

The two great economic sectors of the past 20 years in the US have been the FIRE industries (finance, insurance, and real estate), and software / IT.<p><i>Broadly speaking, a society facing the end of an anabolic [growth] cycle faces a choice between two strategies. One strategy is to move toward a steady state in which C(p) = M(p), and d(R) = r(R) for every economically significant resource. Barring the presence of environmental limits, this requires social controls to keep capital stocks down to a level at which maintenance costs can be met from current production, and maintain intake of resources at or below replenishment rates. This can require difficult collective choices, but as long as resource availability remains stable, controls on capital growth stay in place, and the society escapes major exogenous crises, this strategy can be pursued indefinitely.</i><p><i>The alternative is to attempt to prolong the anabolic cycle through efforts to accelerate intake of resources through military conquest, new technology, or other means. Since increasing production increases W(p) and increasing capital stocks lead to increased W(c), however, such efforts drive further increases in M(p). A society that attempts to maintain an anabolic cycle indefinitely must therefore expand its use of resources at an ever-increasing rate to keep C(p) from dropping below M(p).  Since this exacerbates problems with depletion, as discussed above, this strategy may prove counterproductive.</i><p>Yes, software provides efficiencies, and some of the recent chain of startups (Google, Twitter, Facebook) have succeeded in ephemeralizing knowledge, communications, and networking in ways which, to an extent, increase social interaction, but they&#x27;re doing so at the cost of a highly confounded signal/noise ratio, and with significant externalities.<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole &quot;moving financial capital around&quot; aspect of tech funding and investment, which I&#x27;m coming to increasingly question.  I don&#x27;t find it particularly productive.  The number of firms whose exit strategy is &quot;get bought by Google / Facebook / Apple&quot; reminds me strongly of the late 1990s &quot;get bought by VA Linux&quot; (remember them?).<p>And for perspective, I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and have seen a few cycles so far.",1391643274

While my usual process to get JS-heavy web apps to work is load scripts from the domain itself, plus any standard CDN domains (like CloudFlare), your site does not work without widgets.js from Twitter, which is pretty crazy.<p>You depend on three different CloudFlare subdomains - one of which serves a tracking script, <i>on top of</i> you trying to load tracking scripts from MixPanel, Google Analytics, Rollbar, Intercom, Twitter and Facebook.

A great programmer thinks about the program on a constant basis, whether driving or eating. That method takes an incredible amount of mental energy.<p>> Before I sit down to code something, most of the instructions have already run through my head.<p>> Programming takes an incredible amount of energy, so most programmers are fairly young.<p>It may be a bit anachronistic to look at statements like these in the light of subsequent revolutions in software development such as XP and Agile. But I can&#x27;t help thinking as I read this that he&#x27;s doing it wrong. All the talk about using lots of mental energy to &quot;have a complete grasp&quot; of the program is fairly useless when faced with ever increasing complexity and code base size. Test Driven Development and clean code organization goes a long way towards breaking large problems down into easier to manager parts.",1391641700

That&#x27;s what I did back in the 90s when &quot;check cards&quot;† were first introduced. I phoned the bank and asked if the Visa logo meant the card be used without a PIN.

For example, the government of California, where I don&#x27;t live and have never once been, could accuse me of trafficking drugs there, which I haven&#x27;t done. Or, I could sue you for personal injury, even though we&#x27;ve never had contact outside this comment thread. Indeed, you could do the same to me.<p>Our legal system exists to resolve these claims. Ideally, when an absurd claim is made, the courts toss it. But crucially, <i>that doesn&#x27;t prevent the victim having to waste time and resources on a defense or response.</i><p>What&#x27;s the solution to this problem? Usually, it&#x27;s to create some disincentive against outrageous or frivolous legal actions. Sometimes, this can take the form of sanctions, which can involve a monetary penalty. But what happens when a state government is the one initiating the action? Theoretically, sanctions might be possible in some scenarios. But I&#x27;d imagine that in practice, governments get sanctioned only once in a blue moon, if that.",1391641460

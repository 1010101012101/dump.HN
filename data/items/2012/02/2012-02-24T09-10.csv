But it's a huge difference with Xcode 3 and other IDEs out there.<p>I can only conclude that you have absolutely no concrete experience of the state of other tools and languages. Eclipse, IntelliJ and Visual Studio with Resharper are lightyears ahead of XCode 4 when it comes to assisted programming.<p>Here's the clue: all of these tools expose the code DOM to tool writers. Even if Intellij didn't have over 100 different ways to refactor code, <i>I could write my own</i>. Fuck, I wrote a Resharper plugin that loaded javascript file to manipulate the dom and pass it to StringTemplate [1] The javascript file then decides <i>based on what is at the cursor</i> which templates to display when the user hits Alt-Enter. Think for a minute about what has to happen under the hood for that to happen. Then think what else is possible. Then realize that <i>its not there</i> in XCode 4.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.stringtemplate.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stringtemplate.org/</a>",1330077464

I wasn't into rails from the beginning - I followed the recent one <a href=""http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html</a><p>I think it's the ideal example for demonstrating a web framework.<p>1. It gives basic introduction to the framework and installation notes.<p>2. It's simple enough to follow, yet large enough to 
show major aspects of development with rails.<p>3. It shows all major aspects of the web application development - db access layers, db creation and migration, models and validation, request routing, controllers, views, partials...<p>> What impresses me is code-reuse, modularity and readability. Which is why I preferred Django instead of Rails 2.<p>I use both Django and Rails. Rails has various stuff which I need for a basic app out of the box, which Django doesn't have - asset pipelines, coffeescript integration, swappable templates, bundler for dependencies, rvm(not exactly rails) for isolating ruby version and gemset, tested gems for basic tasks(kaminari, devise, paperclip) etc.<p>I know I can do all of it in Django/Python(pip, virtualenv, coffee --watch, webassets etc etc), but rails sets up things for me and I can begin coding.<p>Rails does require more peripheral knowledge, but it's optimized for people who know rails. Beginners will be more at home with Django, but you are a beginner for a very short period of time, and optimizing for beginners while forfeiting comfort for people who are on-board isn't a good compromise IMO.<p>In an ideal world, we can have frameworks which is both beginner and power-user friendly, but I seldom see it happening it in the real world.<p>As far as reading code goes, I have trouble following Rails code, and my only friend is the interactive debugger - I set breakpoints, read code in the editor, continue, break...<p>I haven't read Django's code in a while, but it used to be quite heavy on magic - not sure about the current status.",1330076785

That's my tribute to the creators, because it's human nature to try to liken yourself to what you admire. Owning a copy is flattery.

Granted, I use an emulator and I often download, from abandonware sites, the ports most suitable for my emulator: I might have originally bought the game for Amiga but now I'm playing the PC version under DOSBox.

There's a significant motivation factor buried in it.<p>If I really loved a game made this year I would want to buy it, not rent it. If I smelled it's a classic I would want to be able to play it in an emulator in the 2030's or even later. This means I need an ""internet-age hardcopy"", i.e. something that I can stash somewhere and unpack later for use with an emulator or original hardware.

That just gets annoying after a bit.  Node.js can serve requests, grab data from to world's slowest API's, send emails, etc, all from a single process.<p>2)  Although I think Ruby's strong point is readability and succinct LOC, it's hard to beat using the same language for everything and not context switching.  Maybe my brain is broken, but I used to drive myself nuts writing client js and using Ruby's nil instead of null and Object.new instead of new Object.<p>For the project I'm working on now, I had to make my own asset pipeline.  It uses less for css (and bootstrap), precompiles handlebar templates and concats all the js into a single file and uglifies it.  Cost me 2-3 hours, about the same time it took me to learn Rails asset pipeline and was about 10x more fun.<p>Last point I'll add is when Rails was a baby it made fun of all the xml configs etc that other frameworks bogged developers down with.  Now it's grown up a little, and although sprocket and yaml files aren't xml, the concept is the same.

(irrelevant how they got there -- you may not even know) For all intents or purposes these look like encrypted data, and if they could force you to ""decrypt"" them you have a problem of Kafkaesque proportions.<p>Is there any rule that data on your drive should be somehow sensible and decryptable to human-understandable information, using keys that you have in your head?",1330074491

The problem is error handling in callbacks, capturing stack traces from the async parent callers, and generally not crashing Node if you forget to try/catch your async handler. However, this problem is known, and this is being worked on in the form of ""domains"". Btw. Iced CoffeeScript doesn't solve this a single bit.",1330074399

I am sure you know that, but I think it's worth mentioning. So I would define inventory as ""a page view plus a slot available on that page which Google can use to maximise revenue"".",1330074263

It seems here that lying to the police suddenly gives some degree of protection which strikes me as somewhat insane.<p>Indeed there have been cases in the UK where the defendant's apparent cooperation was enough to ensure there could be no RIPA prosecution even though the password to the encrypted hard drive did not seem to work.

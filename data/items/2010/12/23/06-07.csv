2033731,comment,2033357,2033592,0,0,raganwald,,,"<i>I  think the turban example is perfectly consistent with what the author said. You ask ""how would rules such as the uniform rule for the police ever evolve?"" The answer is: in much the same way! Under this author's understanding of that example, the rule under scrutiny would be: ""Every policeman must wear a uniform cap."" The Sikhs, wishing to wear dastaars, would petition the chief of police to be able to wear a dastaar instead. The chief of police (or whoever), would then think to herself, ""Well, is it all that important that our police officers wear matching CAPS, or is the important part merely that they wear headgear that matches the rest of the outfit and contains a badge?"" She would then conclude that the more appropriate rule, which should apply to /everyone/, regardless of his religion, should be that every police officer must wear a hat of the appropriate color and that the hat must contain a badge. A Sikh could wear a dastaar; an atheist could wear a baseball cap or a turban--or a dastaar. The point is that /anyone/, not just a Sikh, can wear /any/ hat he chooses, so long as it meets those standards that /are/ considered too important to change, such as matching color and a badge.</i><p>You have an enormously optimistic view of police chiefs. Or perhaps police chiefs where you live are reasonable, inclusive people who are always looking for ways to broaden their force's recruiting.<p>Whereas up here in Toronto, the opposite was true. The police force remained staunchly Euro-centric until forced by rule to reconsider rules like the requirement that officers wear the prescribed hat. Left to their own devices, police chiefs saw no reason to change their rules about headgear or the minimum height required to be a police officer.<p>The changes didn't come because Sikhs petitioned the chiefs of police, the changes came because Sikhs petitioned the courts. And that is why we have constitutional democracies: Some portions of our rules and regulations cannot be left up to the ""free market"" or an executive branch that is concerned with obtaining a plurality of votes in the next election.",1293086292

And I don't mean ""good"" as in the most technical either, although that is important as well. I mean, where can I find a hacker that understands people too? You may be able to html and css your way through MIT or Stanford, but can you create an application that people actually want, or are capable of using?<p>Many applications built by hackers are fun, but many people are running around town forgetting a fundamental rule... We're building businesses here (yes I said it). I know that's a dirty word for many hackers, because it takes the novelty out of the work. It's a reality though. If your thingy doesn't have a business model behind it, you will have to rely on VC, and hope you can find a way to make it a business before the cash-money runs out.<p>I am a business-type (sort of), meaning I have ideas of what end users want, and I think of ways for those ideas to make money. And, I don't know how to build them. So I am in need of a good hacker (based on the explanation above) to help me build a social network that has components loosely related to LinkedIn. (How's that for ambiguous?)  I know YC says find a friend of a friend, but I ain't got no friends.<p>I completely agree with YC, in that a startup is far too much work for a single individual. That is why I am looking for a hacker to marry. I welcome all comments (as long as they're positive), leads (except your girlfriend's great uncle Harry), website links (to your work), or contact information.

It's really easy to set up a server, and it has a lot more flexibility as far as mic sensitivity. I find the latter to be very useful when working in a noisy coffee shop or outside during the summer.<p><a href=""http://mumble.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mumble.sourceforge.net/</a>",1293084766

As infuriating as the conversation was for a knowledgable person, it would probably suffice to resolve most technical issues people have.<p>I think the mistake was admitting to having a mac.  A rule of thumb is to pretend that the computer is Windows / IE so the rep can go by the book.",1293084547

Sounds more like the Federalist Society to me...<p>I agree though that a better market is preferable to NN and the current system. The issue here is how to solve the network effects / physical monopoly problems that plague the industry.<p>On the one hand, no one is going to run a fully parallel system - even the incumbents didn't. They bought it from companies who bought it from companies that went bankrupt in the process of doing it.<p>This means we'd need to either nationalize the existing system or put it into some type of co-op with the internet users as the voting group (via the gov't) - or less drastically we could mandate a certain bulk rate discount (w/ indexing to some of the known variables) so that new players could instantly begin competing without needing to overcome the massive infrastructure issues.<p>...or we could just do net neutrality which is a good stop gap - which is what it seems is the current pragmatic solution. Let's hope a better market-based system can eventually replace the monopolies, but until now it seems like NN is the way to go.",1293084442

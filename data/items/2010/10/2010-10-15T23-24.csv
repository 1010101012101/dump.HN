1796777,comment,1795141,1796000,0,0,WesleyJohnson,,,"For those of you who think and operate this way, I'm sorry, but this WILL catch up with you eventually. At my last job our sales pitch was ""Yes"". I won't use the word ""literally"" here as it would be an outright lie, but it was pretty close. Our sales guys went into meetings with the assumption that we could pull off whatever the clients wanted in nearly any time frame they wanted. This was all decided on at sales time without any consultation of the actual development team on capabilities, cost or how long it would take to actually implement. Management would tell the IT/IS department (yes, we had to do both) that it was a show of faith in the abilities of our team and that we should be proud of the fact that sales and management were so confident in us. You know what that is? BS. That is sales ""selling"" IT. It's complete and utter BS.<p>Sure, we met those deadlines, we implemented those features and we made small fortunes for the company. But at what cost? The infrastructure starts to resemble Jenga more and more, your spaghetti code becomes harder to maintain, you end up with magic strings, magic numbers, client specific cases and conditions and your start eating into your IT budget by having to hire more programmers to support all of your crappy implementations and more hardware to handle the un-optimized pile of crap you're running.<p>What's worse is the very people you rely on to keep this tower from falling over, your programmers who have become so familiar with all the undocumented edge cases of your system, are also the very people you're basically forcing out. You're forcing them out because they become tired of not innovating, not refactoring and not progressing the technology OR the business, but instead spending all their time stressing over not ""crossing the wires"" of this delicate catastrophe. And when you finally lose them as a developer, and you will, it costs you severely in down-time and loses in productivity while you get your other developers and new hires up to speed. But not only do they have to learn the business, they also have to learn all the edge cases that were only known to your senior employee who was finally fed up and quit. And guaranteed, something, somewhere will be forgotten, that wire will get crossed and you'll pay dearly.<p>And while I do agree that making money and growing the business is the end goal of the business, don't assume that your IT guy isn't concerned with that and just wants to write ""pretty code"". Often times your IT guys understand the business more than sales, middle management and sometimes upper management because they deal with the logic, the clients, the sales team, and everyone in between day in and day out. When they're pleading with you to say ""no"" to a customer or ask for an extension to implement feature ""x"" properly, maybe you should take heed a little more often. Because the duct taped feature ""x"" that won over client ""A"" today, could be the same feature that loses you client ""b"" and ""c"" tomorrow because the only developer that new their system well enough to keep them running walked out after being forced to write yet another band-aid.<p>Of course when he quits and everything falls apart, everyone will just assume he was an overpaid, crappy programmer and his buggy code is what was the ultimate cause.",1287185363
1796776,comment,1795141,1796000,0,0,dkarl,,,"The sales guys would agree that reliability and scalability affect<p>1)  The ability to take on new business (a big problem if you're kicking ass and growing fast.)<p>2)  The cost of delivering service to those customers.<p>3)  The ability to deliver new features because developers aren't spending their time fixing existing ones or helping operations fight fires caused by the existing ones.<p>Sales will agree about all of that.  However, when it comes time to argue over priorities, they'll fight tooth and nail to get resources devoted to new development instead of scalability and reliability -- until stuff is broken, customers are angry, and <i>their</i> reputation is going into the toilet.  At that point they'll rightly pin the blame on you, though.  They want you to be responsible and do your job.  They just won't reward you for it with ""visibility.""<p>Actually, the best way to get sales guys on the side of reliability and scalability is when they're told to stop selling a product because your systems or operations staff can barely support currently provisioned customers, but good luck making that happen without having a report of SLA penalties already paid and a convincing projection of large penalties in the future.  Also, at that point, you'll already have signed or nearly-signed deals that haven't been deployed yet.<p>So if you just go along with the sales guys, they'll drive you into a freakin' ditch.  The sales guys do not have a balanced view of the business any more than the developers do.  Everybody has to contribute their piece of the picture and fight for the priorities that they understand.<p>When the engineers stop sticking up for what <i>they</i> understand better than anybody else, things get out of balance, your technical assets start to crumble, and eventually you're technically bankrupt.  But throwing engineering priorities under the boat and doing anything necessary to please the sales guys in the short term can make you very popular.  ""Visibility"" means making people who drive revenue happy, and abdicating your responsibility to deliver bad news is the easiest way to achieve it.<p>But the worst aspect of ""visibility"" is that from outside engineering, the applications that are chronically broken are perceived as the vital core of ongoing feature development, and the developers who work on those applications get the most visibility.  If you asked a sales guy to write a list of the most valuable developers in the company, that's who they would name.  Can you imagine a more perverse incentive?",1287185358

From the article:<p><i>It is the 21st century billionaire version of the old adage, “give a man a fish and he eats for a day, teach him to fish and he eats for a lifetime</i><p>I think all he's saying is that one can't throw money at problems and expect them to be fixed. That's an opinion I'll agree with.<p>If we want to spend money and give to charities, that's valid...but if we're really looking for long-term fixes (see: ending poverty, world hunger, etc) then that's not the way to go about it. We'd need to really create a system behind the charities; when you give money, that should go into investing for the future and creating future solutions to fix problems, rather than simply repairing something in the now and here.<p>Look at natural disasters. A typhoon occurs and the world pitches in and sends hundreds of millions to the troubled country. That's fine. But what we tend to forget a month after the hurricane is that the reason the countries got hit so hard might just be because of poor infrastructure or inadequate technology or systems. Those things still stay in place long after the world sends money; if they tragically get hit again, nothing has changed and the world will (yet again) be expected to simply send more money.<p>My favorite example of ""throwing money at a problem"" is something that happened a few years ago:<p>Some clothing company (Gap, I think, but I'm not 100% sure) had a huge surplus one year that they decided to give away to some village/s in an impoverished South Asian country. All they did was take their extra clothes [money] and throw it at the problem of horrible poverty in the place.<p>What ended up happening? It was an amazing two year fix. The clothes were so much (in quantity) that they lasted for a few years before running out. During that time, the fact that Gap sent all these free clothes made the entire industry that used to make clothes for these parts go out of business. At the end of the two years, they were in a position that's worse off than what they were a few years back. No local clothes makers; no free Gap.<p>""Charity doesn't solve anything"" might be a bit strong. But he's on to something. Throwing money at a problem doesn't fix anything in the long-term; the way to do it is to invest in the future, not throw money at the present.<p>Just my (albeit a bit long) $0.02",1287184278

But in my opinion if the idea is truly worth what you think it is I would consider a proposition to start out 50/50 and as revenue comes into the company he will have the option to buy out your equity (only up to his requested 60/40) at x number of dollars per share.<p>This ensures for him that he will get that ownership he wants, and although you will ultimately end up with less in the end if the company is a huge success being the technical founder of any startup leaves many more doors open for your future in the end. And the possibility that it will not succeed entirely yet you would still get a (presumably) significant amount of money from the initial windfall would seem like a win/win to me.<p>Again, that is just IMHO so take it for what its worth, but as someone who has out significant amount of time into several projects and seen some pay off both big and small that is an awful lot of time to just let it go to waste.<p>That said, whatever you do, do NOT agree to go separate ways AND sign a NDA. The situation you are in now holds up much better in a suit than one where you sign an NDA then decide to launch any way.

I'm more or less impressed with the fact that the device has not been released simply due to Apple's level of standards when it comes to their products. I can almost guarantee most companies would have released the product as-is.",1287183858

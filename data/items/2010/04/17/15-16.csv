For starters, if tweetmeme and the major Twitter clients out there adopted a standard of providing the link as an annotatioon, it would basically destroy the url shortening market in one fell swoop<p>Another potentially awesome use case involves retweets. Twitter's new retweet system was controversial when it was rolled out because it removed the ability for people to input their own comments on a link they wanted to rewet. The truth is, though, that there was usually a pretty limited space for these comments in the first place. Now, annotations could be used as the main conduit for comments about a particular link. A global, Twitter-wide commenting system could be established if everybody agreed to a standard.<p>Providing more details about the users posting the tweets would also be quite useful. Imagine if you see an interesting tweet from someone, and embedded in that tweet is also their entire social networking presence and perhaps an extended biography.<p>The possibilities seem limitless, but as the article mentions there are potential drawbacks. For one, it may take a while to get the big players to agree on standards. Also, the elegance and power of Twitter was the 140 character limit. What happens when a bunch of other garbage starts getting attached to these previously svelte tweets.<p>Whatever happens it is sure to be interesting, though.",1271519394
1273192,comment,1272807,1272929,0,0,cosmicray,,,"Once upon a time, the POTS system used something called 'in-band signaling'. An example of that was really old coin telephones, where the devices would send certain tones to tell the operator which coins you had deposited. John Draper (aka Capt Crunch) exploited this in-band signaling to access the toll network, and make long distance calls as tho he had trunk signaling and origination. I assume that anything Woz was doing was similar to this. Bell Labs responded by moving the toll signaling out-of-band. Out of all this, and for other more important reasons, was born SS7.<p>edit: from the wiki article on SS7 ...<p><i>SS5 and earlier systems used in-band signaling, in which the call-setup information was sent by playing special multi-frequency tones into the telephone lines, known as bearer channels in the parlance of the telecom industry. This led to security problems with blue boxes. Modern designs of telephone equipment that implement out-of-band signaling protocols explicitly keep the end-user's audio path—the so-called speech path—separate from the signaling phase to eliminate the possibility that end users may introduce tones that would be mistaken for those used for signaling.</i>",1271519381

There format is pretty strict and consistent across jurisdictions. The spec has to support your claims, showing how to implement your invention, the claims have to be one sentence and demarcate the legal monopoly. You can claim hugely broad (normal technique) and then narrow them down later; if you claim very broadly however the examiner may just issue generic citations for the search which won't help you get a patent with strong validity.<p>Search, yes. Again, it's not rocket science but patent examiners do have access to dedicated technology databases including relevant journal databases, things like IBM techical bulletins and often their own internal libraries, as well of course as better search tools for the publicly available patents. Espacenet is a pretty searchable db, Google have a patent search, IBM used to have a good one and their TDB were often useful. Use the USC, IPC, EPC classifiers to speed up your search.<p>Caution: IIRC in the US you're required by law to submit the findings of any search you make, if you do a really good search and find decent prior art that can come back to bite you doubly if you fail to disclose it.<p>Mechanical tools may be better protected using other IP like industrial design, also trademarked shape can be good to prevent direct ripoffs.<p>As for nudges last point - what it does give you is some measure of protection against being sued for performing the invention in your granted patent. But it's likely that tech you're building on is patented too in which case you may need to attempt some sort of cross licensing.",1271517062

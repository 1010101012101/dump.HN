182195,comment,181392,182079,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Great reply.<p>My invocation of Position 1 was somewhat whimsical, and I'm not inclined to defend it much further. I'm not convinced that these Intellectual Ventures guys can justifiably be called ""patent trolls"" -- I think it's more likely that they're fishing for research grants, or slices of other people's research grants, using many, many pieces of bait -- but I'm not sure they're necessarily doing something useful. Based solely on the article, they look like theorists to me -- long on ideas, short on implementation, lacking in (and perhaps ignorant of) good statistics, in love with the backs of their own envelopes, and apt to gloss over any pesky details with Olympic-level handwaving.<p>I will take note of this line of yours:<p><i>I know a lot of people who've dealt with the patent system (software)... I don't know anyone who looks at the patent database as a 'treasure trove' of ideas they can put to use. Most people think of it as a 'minefield' of ideas that are already taken.</i><p>I wonder whether your opinion of the patent system is colored by your experience with software patents -- a modern abomination that threatens to bring down the whole system. When you say ""most patentable ideas could be reverse-engineered in a day"", you sound like a justifiably frustrated software engineer.<p>But I think patents make more sense when applied to physical machines and gadgets that are harder to get working, harder and more expensive to reverse-engineer, and harder to cover with enormously wide blanket patents (perhaps because the prior art is so much richer, the phase space so much larger, and the inspectors so much better trained).",1210048427

I went on to look at your submissions: probably more than 80% of your posts are of the ""Ask YC"" genre.<p>Maybe you are trying to initiate a discussion. Maybe you are just trying to get the community attention. Maybe you are just putting your ideas ""out there""... I really don't know what it is. But it's annoying as hell!<p>I even don't think that you are just karma-whoring. It seems that you lose more karma after entering in the discussion than by posting your (usually pretty inane) questions.<p>If you really want to test your ideas or get the community feedback, I suggest you to keep a blog, write essays, put everything you may think interesting there. The process of writing will probably get you much more valuable information than people here ever will. All you're getting (and we're getting) is noise.",1210048258
182191,comment,182085,182183,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"My only fear is that the stock didn't sink as much as I expected it to, and that may be because a good deal of people thought along the same lines. They expected Yahoo not to budge, MS to walk away, and Yahoo to come crawling back. Meaning that if Yahoo doesn't bring MS back to the table, their stock has a decent way left to fall.",1210048203

182173,comment,182085,182168,0,0,wanorris,,,"Depends on whether Yahoo is ready to grovel to get Microsoft back to the table. After all the cheap shots they've taken, I can't blame Microsoft for wanting to wash their hands of the whole thing and move on.<p>Edited to add: on further review, groveling is certainly overstating the case. But if Yahoo is willing to reach out and make it look like this can be a real partnership both sides are actually interested in, it will be a lot more doable.<p>The whole thing where they've been trying to make Microsoft look bad and act like they want nothing to do for the deal hasn't benefited anyone.",1210047008
182172,comment,182024,182024,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Exactly.  This is why all the UML-mania is b.s.  A UML diagram of the high level classes in a project?  Yes that is useful.  And guess what?  You can generate that automatically from the code.  But doing the entire app in UML, as some people would have us do?  Yeah you can generate code from a UML diagram, but it is infinitely faster to type code than it is to dink around with funny Visio widgets and try to click inside tiny text boxes & select types from a drop down.<p>My college recently dropped Java from CS 1 and 2; instead they decide to use Alice (a graphical toy language) to teach all CS concepts.  You want a loop?  You drag a loop block on to the page. Need a condition on the loop?  Select it from the drop down.  Sounds neat and it is an interesting concept, but ultimately it's just a pain in the ass.  Once a method gets bigger than a few lines, it's almost impossible to position the mouse to make the item drop in the right place.  And writing a complex loop condition can be a tedious maze of drop down menus.<p>Purely visual code input methods are just not an efficient way to enter code.  It's as hard to use as trying to crack eggs to make an omelet while only touching the eggs with a pair salad tongs.<p>These environments don't even address the central issue.  Changing the representation of the code is just lipstick on a pig; the real problem is that <i>software is hard</i>.  There is an essential something to a program (like QWAN) that can't be reduced.  Wrapping it in goofy modeling doesn't change the essential difficulty.<p>In fact, software modeled graphically is actually <i>harder</i> to understand than the text version, because software is full of relationships that are semantic not spatial.  The relationships are not 3 dimensional or 2 dimensional and trying to squish that onto a visual representation just makes things worse.  On the other hand, humans have this wonderful ability to comprehend nuances of semantic meaning in prose.  The textual representation of software is the ""right"" model for it.",1210046973
182171,comment,182085,182142,0,0,wanorris,,,"After years of underperforming, the shareholders saw a chance to take a stock that was selling for under $20 not that long ago and turn it into $33 or $34 a share. If you're scoring at home, that's a 65% or better increase in the value of their investment. And for options holders, there's a good chance that the price change is the difference between the options being underwater (i.e. worthless) and being worth quite a bit.<p>If that were your retirement fund or your stock options in your employer, wouldn't <i>you</i> want that money? And if you were a professional investor, wouldn't you be downright berzerk at all that money being thrown away?<p>Computer geeks like to go around badmouthing Microsoft all the time, but taking that attitude as a CEO or board member of a public company makes you unprofessional and irresponsible. To shareholders, Microsoft's money spends just like everyone else's.<p>Yahoo has underperformed for years. Sure, it has long-term potential. But investors have little reason to think the current management will realize this potential any better than the last couple of regimes. Meanwhile, as much as geeks love to hate Microsoft, they have decades of experience in producing enormous profits, and there's no particular reason to think that buying Yahoo will change that.<p>This isn't just short term vs. long term. This is realizing a return on investment vs. watching that return slip through your fingers. And investors are pissed.",1210046866

Be sure to work with a lawyer...\n# Make sure the contract you’re negotiating has plenty of wiggle room for revision work/iteration during the project...""<p>Not only do these two points contradict each other, my advice for web guys getting into the game is to take the advice of the latter recommendation.  Small business owners hate contracts and don't want to see every detail spelled out.  They see it as a trap, and will think of you as someone who's just looking for a reason to upcharge.<p>Your contracts should be just specific enough to make the client think you've thought of most everything, and include enough wiggle room if things get hairy, but shouldn't spell out every single little item.  And stay the hell away from your attorney when composing this, they only make it worse and of course will charge you an assload for their work.<p>If your game is medium sized businesses or any corporate work, sure go ahead and write up that bulletproof contact.  That's stuff corp and enterprise love to see so they can justify the expense to their higher ups (""look at this 20 page contact boss, it covers everything!"").",1256050653

892447,comment,892317,892317,0,0,shrughes,,,"This is an entirely superficial comparison.  There is none of ""this is how the language affects how you design your software"" and there is plenty of ""oh, here's a quicksort, big and scary.  And looking at the table at the top: ""object oriented"", ""statically typed.""  Is that all the author has to say?  You could substitute C# in place of Scala and get the same point-by-point comparison.<p>What the author completely misses is Scala's entire type system.  The evil genius monster of a type system.  I can't think of any reason why I'd want to use Scala other than the type system -- oh, sure, anonymous functions -- and the fact that not a word is said about traits or type constructors as type parameters or existential types or things that use the word ""implicit"" is depressing.  Scala is not so much object oriented as it is the best strictly evaluated form of Haskell that lives comfortably in the Java ecosystem, that, hey, happens to have classes and traits.<p>And I think it fails to do justice to the good parts of Clojure, too.<p>Also, the benchmark, computing factorial(5000), is nonsense, since it's really measuring the performance of the BigInt implementation.<p>Also, not surprisingly, the one demonstration of the power of macros is the typical body-wrapping kind that might as well be a higher order function.",1256050239

It all adds up to additional time no matter how fast you are or how many all-nighters you pull.<p>And to give some advice to young aspiring web hackers;  pulling all nighters and delivering client work at 2:00 AM does not paint a very good picture of you or your firm to the client.

My hypothesis is that the group seeing the average price would pay very close the average and have a tight distribution of payers. I think the group being shown what the last buyer paid would have a very wide distribution of payers but I have a hunch that they would see a higher average price paid due to some people seeing a high last price paid and saying, well I should at least pay X (I could comfortably get by with paying this much less) or seeing a low last price paid and saying I'll at least pay Y (I'm a good person for paying above that).

WebOS is allows users to run multiple apps at once.  Users beg for multitasking.  You think it impacts game performance?  Absolutely.  Even if every app behaves nicely, they all consume memory.  Memory management is handled by the OS without any direct say of the individual applications.  Whenever the OS decides, it does a Garbage Collection.  Currently, this takes about 300ms (about a third of a second).  Air Hockey contains specific code to lessen the impact of these pauses, but developers can’t turn them off.  A lot of time was spent making sure objects weren’t needlessly allocated to minimize the frequency of the Garbage Collections, but you’ll see the pauses.

I really hope they can fix that somehow, but it's starting to look like the heavy reliance on javascript was a design mistake.<p>However I don't have any problems with Mac sync.  I've always used Spanning Sync to keep my Mac synced up with my Google account.  Once there, the Pre just finds everything automagically.<p>It has been a bit of a shift in thinking to go from the old model of ""I need to sync my device with my Mac"" to the new ""My device will just find what it needs in the cloud"".  But after using it for a few months, I'm really happy with the change.  Palm synergy just works, and I don't at all miss the old way of doing things (cross your fingers and hit the hotsync button).",1256048648

Also, keep in mind that part of their desired lifestyle is NOT ""drinking schnapps to get through the day or grinding your teeth at night"", which is the sort of thing that you get when rushing day and night to build a full-featured system in a couple weeks.<p>Seriously, can you honestly point to any sites that have <i>not a hair</i> over 21 consecutive days to build in their entirety and match the breadth of features, design quality, testing, iterating with the customer, etc, that would be expected of a typical Happy Cog project -- and yet somehow still have a reasonably healthy lifestyle?<p>To me it sounds like a variation on the ""I can build this in a weekend"" HN meme.<p>[EDIT]: mind you, I will agree that I've seen plenty of good systems built in under 6 months, just not 2-3 weeks :)",1256048500

After iterating through a few prototypes with friends, I opened the site to the public last week.<p>Some data so far: The average visitor generates over 50 page views, and stays for longer than 5 minutes. There's significant click-through to Amazon, which is how the site generates revenue. People seem to enjoy the site, but only a few seem to be sharing it with their friends.<p>I have a Facebook Platform app in the works, which I hope will help to increase the site's virality.

If we predict right, we get a surge of dopamine and some positive reinforcement. If we get it wrong, the dopamine neurons stop firing which, aside from making us feel like crap, serves as a signal that the prediction needs to be revised. Normal learning operates by consciously acquiring information and hoping it eventually filters down into the subconscious. Trial and error, on the other hand, puts a direct line into our subconscious - it's much more efficient.",1256047235

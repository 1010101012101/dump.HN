First let me say that if you want 4-5% a year you need to earn probably 8-9% a year. That's because you'll lose 4% or so just to inflation and taxes.<p>Next, with that much money you will have many people that may want to take it from you. So go out and get an umbrella insurance policy that covers your net worth to protect against ambulance chasers.<p>Also, you're going to have relatives and long lost friends coming and asking your for money for all sorts of things. I suggest you harden your heart and learn to tell them ""NO"" right now before you get burned. If you want to give them money, then make it a gift and not a ""loan."" Those types of loans are never repaid and if you are expecting them to be re-paid and they aren't it will ruin your relationship.<p>Now for actual investing advice.<p>First, you don't want to do anything stupid and lose that money. So be VERY conservative in your investment decisions. You do not need to risk 10-15% a year returns because you already are in the top 1% of net worth in the country at this point.<p>Second, most financial advisors do not have your best interests at heart. They will sell you expensive products that generate fees for them and probably underperform the market. So your best choice if you want exposure to stocks is to just buy a low cost index fund and not get into the stock market trading game.<p>Third, you will want bonds to work as fixed income and I'd only buy Treasury bonds as they have no credit or call risk. You don't save enough in taxes usually to make the risks of munis worth the price of admission. IMO. During the credit crisis in 2008 Munis went DOWN in value, but Treasury Bonds were up almost 30%. That tax savings people thought they had went out the window when the market panicked.<p>Fourth, you should have some hard assets for inflation shock insurance in your portfolio. Gold works best. IMO. It doesn't produce interest or dividends,  but it can go up like a rocket when stocks and bonds are suffering.<p>Finally, you should keep a slug of cash sitting around to help you ride out market storms and support yourself so you don't have to sell assets out of desperation when they are down in price.<p>So I do think the Permanent Portfolio allocation would be a good choice. It gives you growth with an average CAGR of 9-10% the past 40 years. It gives you protection with the worst loss being in 1981 when it lost about -4-6%. It gives you stability because it won't have crazy swings in value. Lastly, it gives you control over your finances so you don't need to use a money manager and pay exorbitant fees.<p>For now, you may want to park that money in a very safe Treasury Money Market fund while you make your decision. They pay almost no interest, but it's better than jumping into something and losing your shirt. Don't let the financial advisors you're going to meet pressure you into expensive and dumb investment products. And, BTW, that's mostly what they're going to offer you.<p>If this sounds like too much to handle, then just go to www.vanguard.com and contact their money managers. They charge a small fee each year but will not do anything dumb with your money and their index funds are well run and cheap.",1265579936
1108353,comment,1108163,1108330,0,0,azeemazhar2,,,"Good points. I ought to clarify: back to the idea of rebalancing. It is really about checking your assumptions and trimming your sails a few times a year.<p>As to fund managers: i think that is the case with mutual fund managers. But it certainly isn't the case with hedge funds or VC. VC for example guarantees you will lose money uness you chose a handful of funds whose identity you know a priori.\nAs for hedge funds--they cover a broad church--of which two remain specially interesting: Special situations/global macro -- where you need to know and understand a manager (who is essentially a business man) and find someone who has decent risk management in place as well as a really good investment process.I like Paulson for this.\nThe second interesting area is the the high frequency systematic trading if highly liquid instruments (CTAs, if you will) which have a very different risk/return profile especially in chop markets and actually have a distribution benefit.<p>Eaten alive isn't very precise--you can actually model your fees and work out how much of you will be eaten.",1265579881

1108350,comment,1108163,1108163,0,0,portman,,,"With all due respect, I think you're asking the wrong question.<p>(a) Think of investments like a function with two inputs:  risk and return. You've picked a desired level of return but haven't identified a desired level of risk, so by definition nobody can recommend an investment strategy.<p>(b) There's no such thing as a ""steady 4-5% annual return from $5 million"" for any meaningful definition of ""steady"".<p>(c) Where did 4-5% come from? Without understanding the thought process that went into those figures, it's hard to make any suggestions.<p>If you want to get the most out of free advice on HN, I think you should rephrase the question along the following lines:<p><i>""I recently inherited a little over $5 million. I am Y years old. I plan on working until I am R years old and expect to live until L years old. My current monthly expenses are M1 and I expect those to grow to M2 over the next 10 years.

If there was capacity to charge the car, there is by definition the capacity to use the power from the car.<p><i>They would need to be able to communicate to each of these vehicles and throttle them up and down, calculating, in real time, which ones were suitable for use.</i><p>Well, the calculation would be done at the car--nobody else knows how much power is left.  So that computation is local to the car, and yes, it is done in real time.<p><i>Power would be flowing every which way.   Residential areas would be generating some of their own power while transmitting some extra to commercial areas, which would be simultaneously getting some of their power from centralized power plants.</i><p>Every which way.  From the point of view of the residence, power is either going in or out to the line in the alley.  Which is connected to the neighbor as well.  The grid is not any more complex that it is today--there is the same connectivity.<p><i>Some residential areas would be drawing power and then five minutes later, they would have surplus power.   Industrial customers would be drawing power from numerous sources at once.</i><p>Industrial customers draw power from the line (ok, some have TWO lines) that go into their building.  They don't know, don't care, can't tell that it is from lots of places.<p>The complexity of frequency and phase matching to the grid would need to be taken care of at the residential end, not centrally.<p>The best point made here is that of an overnight load that leaves customer's batteries drained when they come out in the morning.  I suspect that the plan was to have the vehicles plugged in by the time the evening meal/entertainment cycle pulls from the grid, and once all go to sleep to be able to charge them from the now less-loaded utility.<p>This is an interesting enough problem that a more disciplined article would be appreciated.  There isn't really enough here to form a nuanced opinion, and I don't agree that it is in-depth as TFA claims.",1265579460
1108340,comment,1108163,1108209,0,0,Retric,,,"While I agree that increasing your stock to fixed income ratio as you grow older is a good idea, the 1% more each year seems to be based on a shorter lifespan.  At 60 there is a reasonable chance you will be alive in 35 years so you still need to be fairly aggressive or inflation eat your nest egg.  Also a major issue with bonds is taxes which can significantly impact returns.<p>The other major investment issue is fees which can dramatically reduce ROI over your lifetime.  Do the math on what 1/2 of 1% will cost you ~13% of your returns over 30 years.   <i>1-((x-.005)^30)/(x^30))</i>  It works out to around 13% for most reasonable ROI.",1265579452

You don't have to be too bright to be a good investor. In the long haul, you'll be ok if you don't do something stupid. So aim for loss MINIMIZATION rather than profit maximation.<p>Also, the markets are very, very tumultuous now and I believe it will get worse. The federal reserve just pumped a massive amount of US dollars in the system and the long term effects of this will be a staggering amount of inflation. So in my opinion, you should invest in assets that are not denominated in US dollars, such as gold bullion and other commodities.<p>Beware of commodities that are traded fractionally. Meaning they sell you more of the commodity than they actually have.<p>Finally, diversify, diversify, diversify. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

The world is just too complex to model effectively: you're at the mercy of black swan events that completely invalidate all of your assumptions.<p>I'd also take issue with your advice to put your money into hedge funds or private equity.

The <i>best</i> fund managers will outperform the market by a large margin, but you have no reason to believe that you'll be able to pick the best funds.

Decide if you want to be a passive or active investor.<p>Passive investing means putting your money into index funds. John Bogle of the Vanguard Group has a series of books out on the topic, there is a slim one  called The Little Book of Common Sense Investing. \n-I'd recommend reading some of his work.<p>Active investing is more difficult. To be honest, most people simply lack the time and effort necessary to invest intelligently in the market. They wont know how to read a balance sheet yet will buy the stocks of companies that they are familiar with. This is sort of like driving blind and it is not something I recommend.\n-If you want some I'll suggest some books for this area, but like I said, it is something that requires a big commitment from yourself.",1265578453

That would make for some very interesting reading.<p>> If it were not possible to optimise it in that method, then someone external can be brought in, who maintains it for half the income, giving you absolute free time to make the next project.<p>Why would they maintain it for half the income, if it was trivial to build they could build it themselves and keep 100%?<p>> I did not speak about bad performers yet - the projects who do not make the required $1.

I sold one copy a month, which was terrible. That's $1 a day. It's really easy as a programmer to do something that makes $1 a day.""<p>I suppose if that desktop software took an hour to make it would be worth it in a few months. More likely it took an amount of time that would better have been spent (from a purely financial perspective) working at Wal-Mart and then investing the funds in an ETF. To make $1 a day ($365/yr) takes only around $4k (what a good programmer earns in <2 weeks) tossed into the market. Thus any project that takes you longer than that for $1/day in return is a waste.<p>Also even if you assumed every project would net $1 per day, you'd still be better off thinking big. A hit Facebook app, for instance, might make $10,000 a day. (A megahit 10x that.) A good keyword to arbitrage via an affiliate account and AdSense could do the same.<p>You're far better off taking a 1% shot at $10k/day than a 100% shot at $1. (You're far better off taking a .1% shot.) You might say ""well what about variance"" but apparently you have the time to create 400 products.<p>Also, Twitter followers have done little of real value for anyone in terms of making a business profitable. On the list of ways to get customers to your web-based business, Twitter's still pretty far down the chain.<p>A far better plan would be to try to create one product that makes $1 per person you drive to it. This is doable. Then you can buy users for far less with ads, roll your profits into more ads, rinse, repeat. This is how people like me who rarely if ever use Twitter have made oodles from the web.

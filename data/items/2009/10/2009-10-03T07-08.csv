Literally thousands upon thousands of projects. They are working on anything and everything, I think that is something that the competition really underestimates here.<p>This is why their parking lots have electrical sockets to plug your car into or why they released Lively (when I was there it was but a one man project that I saw at an internal techtalk). It's all things Googlers wanted to work on. They will work on anything they find interesting and they'll generally get the full support of the company (at least that's how it was in 2007).<p>Now I'm at Microsoft and the biggest change to me is how focused Microsoft is at executing very specific projects. The other big change is how many strengths Microsoft has that most of the world refuses to acknowledge. Microsoft gets a lot of bad press, but holy shit when they target something, they go for all or nothing. There is a drive internal to Microsoft unlike any I've seen... when they want something, they won't stop until it's theirs. They want blood.",1254556654

I never want to do that again.<p>Yeah, I've done it too. Very hard letting someone go. Terrible experience.<p>But you do get people that are a bad fit in their roles, that shouldn't be in them. It's not just bad for a company - it's bad for their coworkers, bad for customers, and maybe it's the worst to the person who is doing a bad job. It must be self esteem crushing to not ever accomplish anything interesting or valuable in the place you spend the most waking hours.<p>So I wonder if the hire-and-fire-regularly cultures do so to desensitize the people there to the process? Everyone I know that runs a moderate to large company or division either lets people go regularly or has a lot of people who are a bad fit on their staff.<p>Which goes into point 2:<p>> What happened to finding better ways at hiring good people?<p>You try, but it's impossible to always get right. Jack Welch was generally regarded as one of the best hiring people of all time, and I listened to an interview of him on hiring. He said that he always thought of it like a ""batting average"" - how many hires are a good fit and mesh well? He says his best rates, even towards the very end of his career, was getting about 2 out of 3 right.<p>That means 1 out of 3 wrong. You ought to spend some effort trying to get someone on track, but having a person who is a bad fit onboard is no good for anyone. The best way to fix that, though, is a really hard question to answer.",1254555999

858599,comment,858510,858543,0,0,gaius,,,"<i>The critical part of this strategy is continuous improvement</i><p>I'm not sure that's true. The occasional sweep to clear away the deadwood is one thing. But if I think about the team I'm in right now, it took a long time (years) to build, we are very very picky about who we let in, and it takes a considerable amount of time to get someone up to speed (regardless of the experience they had when coming in).<p>If the edict came down from on-high that we had to fire the least-performing member and hire someone new every year, well, we simply can't find people at the required level and train them to our own standard that quickly. It would simply destroy a high-performing team for the sake of some fad.<p>Also, deciding the bottom 10% is not always as straightforward as it seems. Say HR simply sacks the guy who shipped the least features that quarter and the team loses the guru who helped everyone else with their tricky problems?",1254555219

I <i></i>never<i></i> want to do that again.<p>What happened to finding better ways at hiring good people? Sure, times change, and yeah, you'll have to let a few go over time. All of these companies just seem to go with a test drive approach. And I rarely find any new, novel approaches on hiring practices.<p>These sorts of practices seem to breed a very impersonal culture, that just makes me biased against big companies. A culture I hope I'm never a part of again.<p>This article is pretty novel in that it's about Enron.

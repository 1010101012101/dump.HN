For example, if it's a web-based social networking app, send your beta announcement mail to, say, 10 people or 50 people and track views and signups for 2-3 weeks. See what kind of network effect you get. Pick your initial invitees wisely. If you want users, then you want them to be the so-called influencers.<p>I also have this question. I am a little reticent, though, because I'm concerned about scalability. In my case, I am writing the front end in typical database-backed fashion, but the backend is several custom C++ components. So while I want users, I'm not sure how much I want them on day one. Everything I read says, ""get users, figure out your weaknesses, and scale as needed."" That's reassuring. Nevertheless, the unknowns that we face can still be daunting.<p>Larger companies and people who have been around the block will often use a PR firm or will simply file a press release themselves. It costs about $1000, from what I understand.<p>I think from the standpoint of your average bootstrapper, guerilla tactics are in order. I plan on using Google Analytics. I haven't tried it yet, but I plan to. It will, for example, show hits based on geographic location. You can use that to target local advertising in the markets where you're getting some initial traction. I don't think there is really a set approach. When you're a guerilla, anything is possible.\n",1173581884

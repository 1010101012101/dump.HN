Also because it can result in a good call back as well (apparently after I left my call-backs had good conversion rates).<p>As long as you combine the right amount of humility, amiability and possibly humour you can turn almost anyone around. For example if someone is getting A LOT of sales calls and yours is the straw that broke the camel's back then you can still help them. Provide information, give em the telephone preference service number (to remove them from sales calls databases), tell them how automated diallers work or how the regulations work in regards to cold calls. Be honest.<p>There is no reason why any call should have to end in a negative on either side. :)",1269100689

If weed was legal, you can bet that nobody would be killing each other over territory; it would just be yet another thing you could buy at Starbucks or the corner convenience store.""<p>If weed was legalized, the dealers would just move onto something heavier, like cocaine.  Not only that, but the weed you get from the government would have to be regulated and it wouldn't be the same as the stuff you get on the streets, which would still result in dealers selling it illegally.<p>When you can't get it at starbucks (which probably won't happen unless they get a license) or as easily as you want it, will you still buy from a dealer down the street?<p>The problem I see is that many of the pro-marijuana users are just like the pro-piracy people.  They won't stop until they get exactly what they want, which is just unrealistic.<p>When music piracy first came to the masses in '99 (I know it was around well before this), the main argument was that music was too expensive and the artists were getting screwed.  Now that you can get music for 99 cents and the artist can sell it without a recording contract, piracy is worse than ever and there are a whole new set of excuses.<p>This is why I believe that the illegal sale of pot will never stop unless it's completely unregulated, which will never happen.<p>We also don't have any really good long-term studies regarding pot.  Cigarettes cause cancer.  Do we really want to legalize another substance that does the same thing or worse?<p>You also seem to shift the blame of the violence on the government.  So, it's the government's fault that kids decided to sell pot illegally, make shit-tons of money, and attempt to get another dealer killed (and get killed in the process).  They could have somehow magically prevented the situation by legalizing pot.<p>It's this kind of thinking that has blamed the cigarette companies for killing people when in reality, we all have free will.  If you start smoking tomorrow, it's your own fault if you get cancer, not the company that sold it to you.",1269100385

1206501,comment,1206209,1206209,0,0,idlewords,,,"I'm surprised to see otherwise smart people treating this idea seriously.   Consider just the following:<p>- the whole point of startups is to test high-risk ideas in the crucible of the market.  This approach promotes highly risk-averse behavior (since the penalty for failure is getting expelled from the country, along with your family).<p>- you're replacing a market test with bureaucratic criteria.  What does it mean to create five full-time jobs?  Can I hire five people the week before the deadline?  Can I fire them the week after?<p>- The proposal badly skews the relationship between investor and entrepreneur.  Since the entrepreneur's immigration status is conditional on receiving funding, the investor  has essentially received a free subsidy from the government, and holds all the cards in the relationship.<p>- Competitors without startup visa founders know what targets the startup must meet, and can undercut them in order to sabotage their ability to meet the visa test.<p>I'm sure others can think of many ways this system can be gamed.    The more philosophical objection is that the proposal runs against the basic ideas of a startup - high-risk, high-reward activity, low bureaucratic overhead, a tolerance for repeated failure, and the market as the ultimate arbiter of success.<p>The bill is well-intentioned, but displays a striking level of naivete with regard to people's behavior, and a blithe disregard for the pressures around obtaining and keeping legal residency.<p>The right way to achieve these goals is through comprehensive immigration reform that makes it easier to work legally in the country, acknowledging the economic contribution of millions of undocumented immigrants at every level of the economic ladder.",1269100336

272960,comment,272930,272930,0,0,gaius,,,"I am suspicious of this Bhanwara character. There was a post of his on HN a little while ago about how Visicalc was written in LISP that didn't ring true, and now he claims to have taught RMS the philosophy of Free Software. Every one of his stories is about how he could have been an amazing success if it wasn't for some factor outside his control, like people scheming against him. I think what we have here is a Walter Mitty character.",1218463098

We tend to act rationally a lot of the time.  But those are often ""no brainer"" situations where there is little question about the best option.  The 6 factors in the article come in to play when decisions are less clear.",1218460659

But then there are more than enough wholly negative articles out there; one leaning the other way is past time.<p>If OLPC really has sold that much, in the hundreds of thousands already, then it's probably past the point where it can be killed. And if that many users doesn't let OLPC fix/improve sugar then they'll be kids in those hundreds of thousands willing can hack on it themselves.",1218460249
272940,comment,270915,272787,0,0,brk,,,"I never believed that ""timing the market"" was possible so much as I believed that you can leverage other peoples hype to your advantage.  BTW, I also made a couple of bucks in the hyped real estate fiasco, and then bought a condo on Lake Winnipesaukee, and then stopped.  The difference is that most people over leverage themselves and keep going for ""one more fix"".  Again, rather than being greedy in highly unstable markets I chose instead to get in and get out, in theory I'm leaving money on the table, in reality I'm just taking advantage of things to my benefit and leaving my ""real"" investments to a more sane and logical strategy.",1218460049

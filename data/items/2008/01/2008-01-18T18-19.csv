100428,comment,100170,100379,0,0,marvin,,,"Argentina defaulting can hardly be compared to the US defaulting. I am no economist, but I doubt the US economy would ever be the same if it suddenly decided not to repay any of its foreign debt.<p>Argentina's GDP today is about 1/60 that of the US, and it is hardly a huge player internationally. When they defaulted, 93 billion 2001 US dollars were lost by its creditors. The United States foreign debt (omitting Medicare+Social Security obligations and, unfairly, the more direct debt to its public) is 4000 billion 2007 US dollars.<p>That's a monumental difference, and not paying it back would be a historic violation of trust bordering on an act of war. Argentina _did_ get in a lot of trouble for its decision to default, and it doesn't seem very likely that the world would forgive a similar, but 30 times larger, transgression from the US. It is not an option. If anything like that happened, it would be indirectly (such as being caused by a dollar crash)",1200682455

You end up generalizing something that shouldn't be reduced to Boolean logic. You can't understand Wikipedia by looking at its bytecode, just as you can't understand a human by reading their genome. They're more than the sum of their parts.",1200681347

100414,comment,100319,100384,0,0,pg,,,"<i>Nonetheless, I'm sure that it isn't a mistake...</i><p>If you read the essay carefully, you'd understand that in every era ""right thinking people"" are <i>sure</i> that the things they want to ban are bad.  In 1700 after explaining how broad-minded you were you'd be saying ""Nevertheless, I'm sure it isn't a mistake to consider atheistic propaganda to be harmful to society.""  And you'd be wrong.<p>The whole point of the essay is that you have to step out of yourself to have any hope of seeing beyond the prejudices of your time, and that this is extremely hard.  Your casual use of blanket labels for forbidden ideas is a sign you don't appreciate the difficulty of the problem here.<p>You'll notice I have never said what kinds of speech I think should be banned.  That's because I've seen enough to know that that that second clause following ""I'm pretty open-minded, but..."" is very likely to be mistaken.  Like someone saying that some open mathematical problem will never be solved, you're setting yourself up to look like a fool to future generations.<p>So your use of ""sure"" to me is very convincing evidence that your filters will generate a lot of false positives.  I spent a whole month thinking about this problem.  WYCS took the longest of any essay I've written.  And I would be very reluctant to use that word ""sure"" in this kind of situation.  So either you understand this stuff so much better than me that you've passed through uncertainty and back into certainty, or you simply have the confidence in your opinions that everyone is born with.",1200680874

As with all good abstractions, the market doesn't care how it's composed, only how it functions.

Its visually appealing and I loved it too when I first started.<p>But on looking back I think what makes the greatest chess players is their intelligence and ability to calculate quickly and accurately.<p>Here is an example of one of Fischers greatest games. It really shows his great insight.<p>It is a game from 1971 against Petrosian. Here is the link

But that's exactly what he did.<p>Fischer's insight was that in this particular position getting rid of the bishop allows his rooks to invade into the enemy's position quickly (which is exactly how the game ended).<p>At that time this move was criticized by top gradmasters as a blunder.<p>I just brought this up to show that chess is really a game of intelligence.<p>Regards.",1200680600

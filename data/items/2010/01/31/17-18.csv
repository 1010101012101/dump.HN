1090760,comment,1090361,1090687,0,0,patio11,,,"Charles Stross!  I flew to America to buy a copy of Merchant Princes.  Well, OK, not really: I tried to buy it in Japan from my Kindle with the intention of reading it on my annual trip back, and I was denied because of some licensing agreement your publisher had.  I eventually bought it while passing through Detroit Airport.<p>Despite the fact that this is ridiculously convenient for argument I am about to make, I am actually telling the truth: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1002315"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1002315</a><p>When you say""rent-seeking intermediaries"" I think of a different player than you do.  See, Amazon makes my reading experience awesome.  Your publisher?  They have not made my experience awesome.  I know they spend a lot of money on, e.g., typesetting and wood pulp.  That must suck.  I am having a hard time mustering up sufficient sympathy to back your publisher's attempt to charge me more so that I can subsidize the continued practices which result in 50% of print runs getting pulped.<p>Is Amazon's contribution to total awesomeness worth 70%?  Eh, I don't know.  I'm a software vendor.  Google takes fifty cents out of the last dollar of sales for me (for advertising), despite the fact that I do all the ""actual work"".  I use the scare quotes because if the last couple of years have taught me anything it has taught me that making the sale -- which is what Amazon does for you -- is a non-trivial bit of the business equation.<p>I don't see my profit split with Google as a moral issue -- I see it as a fairly simple business decision.  To whit, I sure like getting that last fifty cents.  I think I managed to get about $20 of your books on my trip to America.  Now, I don't know whether you see $1 or $3 of that at the end of the day, but either is a darn sight better than $0, which is what your publisher is pushing hard for you to get from me.",1264960727
1090759,comment,1090714,1090714,0,0,logicalmind,,,"I'm all for simplifying the overhead on companies, but to translate that into creating jobs is a bit of a stretch. If you cut all of the taxes on an existing company they would not simply add jobs to their company. The only way jobs are added is if they're necessary. This usually means an increase in sales/revenue and the need for more resources.<p>To take a modern example, the recent recession caused companies to go on a spree of job cutting. This wasn't because of any change in tax or overhead. It was the result of lost revenue. Increased revenue causes job increases. Not the efficiencies of overhead.",1264960725

1090728,comment,1090631,1090631,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> 1 To sleep in all day and leave work early<p>No, that doesn't work - all the time - but occasionally, you get to work really really hard and then you can slacken off for a bit, take it easy. If you are the kind of person that is 100% productive all the time this may not be a benefit to you, but I'm not all that regular and I definitely have my productive and less productive phases.<p>So the fact that I don't <i>have</i> to get up at a set hour and report to a boss really helps. In fact, if I know I have to get up early that usually spoils my rest completely because I can't sleep.<p>2> freelancing will make you rich<p>It probably won't make you rich, but it will definitely make you more money than what you'd make doing the same job for a boss. After all the taxes are paid and you've been doing it for two to three years you can expect roughly double the amount left after paying taxes and so on compared to what you'd make working a 'regular' job.<p>And if you use whatever time you have left over to work on a pet project or two then you might even be able to do better.<p>>3 you hate working with people<p>That's a tricky one. If you <i>really</i> hate working with people you have a problem regardless. If you just hate working with certain people, the kick-down lick-up type and the ones that have floated to the top through a lack of substance then as a freelancer you have more control over the situation than as an employee.<p>After all, you don't have to work with everybody, you can choose with which companies you do business. Four or five good customers that pay on time and that you can work with is really all you need. More is better. But you'll never be forced to sit opposite from 'joe', your jerk co-worker that always tries to find a way to get under your skin when the boss isn't looking.<p>>4 to spend the day with your kids<p>I don't understand what the writer is trying to get at here. Maybe the ability to mix a healthy amount of private life with business life is hard to come by, but in general it is doable.<p>You don't need to be super grouchy, and to train everybody around you to walk like ghosts, conversely your family will have to support you when you are in need of some time to work on stuff that needs doing. After all, a regular job takes you out of the house 40 hours per week + commute.<p>Also, there are plenty of freelance jobs where you will be out of the house. And if you're even moderately successful a simple office with a phone line and internet connection doesn't have to cost the world.<p>I've had two occasions in the past where a large customer suggested I have an office in their building, at their cost, or seriously discounted.<p>>5 you can charge whatever you want.<p>No, that's obviously not true, you can't charge whatever you want.<p>But on the other hand it's not the union determining what you can make either. If a job is high pressure, short time to deadline and you're the linchpin, then you can pretty much write your own ticket, within reason. If it's a job that anybody could be plugged in to then it's obviously a different matter. Finding out where there is room is part of the skills you will (need to) develop.<p>>6 freelancing is an easy job<p>Freelancing is definitely <i>not</i> the hardest job out there. The hardest jobs are selected for people that have little to no education and that have very few options in life. Go work in a harbour, a slaughterhouse or a cleaning company for a couple of months.<p>Freelancing is a walk in the park by comparison.<p>It's not as easy as most office jobs, but then again, you can't be fired any more, you have a lot of control that you'd never have as a wage earner. You also don't have any of the (relative) security that comes with that.<p>If you need to track down 'late payments' you're doing something very wrong, late payments should be extremely rare if you have a good relationship with your customers.<p>You can even avoid late payments completely by being completely up front about your financial situation, setting a decent price and demanding half up front and half on delivery, or some scheme like that.<p>>7 to keep up with the household chores<p>Clean stuff up right after you use it and that problem goes away easily enough. It's not like 'household chores' are going to take you the whole day, 20 minutes per day is for a single person more than enough to keep their life in order, if you're with a family of four then it may be a bit more work, but then there are also more hands to help.<p>>8 work will just come to you<p>Not initially, no. But after a while, and if you're good that will start to happen. And at some point you may even have to raise your price just to slow down the influx of new work.<p>That's how you convert a reputation in to $.<p>>9 no boss<p>That's a tough one, self motivation is - for some people - really really hard. If you are not looking at the company where you are working with a continuous eye to how you could and would do better and what you would do if you were more free then freelancing is probably not for you.<p>10> you'll save lots of money<p>Actually, you will save lots of money. They're called 'deductibles', and when you play your cards right you will find that you will probably pay less taxes as a freelancer compared to being a wage earner, at the same income level.<p>>11 you'll have more free time<p>If you are smart about it, and you keep accurate hours and you get good at budgeting jobs then you will eventually have more free time. But the first 2 to 3 years, which is how long it will take you to establish a reputation you will actually be working a lot harder than before.<p>This is fine, as long as you like your work.<p>>12 your family will respect you more<p>If you work either as a wage earner or as a freelancer in order to earn other peoples' respect then you're on the wrong road, regardless of which of the two you choose.<p>You work because it gives <i>you</i> satisfaction, food on the table and the level of security that suits you best.<p>If you feel undervalued as a wage earner then you can boost that satisfaction level - and your self confidence - by 'going solo'. It is also a good introduction in managing money, handling taxes, legal affairs and a whole pile of other useful skills.<p>Think of it as a very good preparation to running a larger business.",1264959589

You can't do that.""<p>What do you mean by ""all Amazon was saying""? That's the crux of the issue: whether publishers will allow themselves to be told by Amazon that they cannot sell over a certain price in their market, or whether they will be allowed to sell at whatever prices they choose.<p>It's a fundamental question about how the online book market, so dominated by Amazon, will work.<p>Your second paragraph doesn't have a clear question; what exactly do you want to understand? I'll try anyway:<p>The marginal cost of producing eBooks doesn't really effect the price-fixing problem. The OP's point is that publishers need the flexibility to try out pricing schemes on the Amazon marketplace to discover what works, but Amazon won't let them. Ultimately, he claims, this will lead to worse results for the consumer because Amazon will be an inefficient marketplace due to the inability of the publishers to recoup costs on books with high initial prices which they can then follow with low prices later.",1264959417

No design doc and no code base is free from changes and improvements, particularly in startups. If you can't deal with changes, you probably should go work for an enterprise company where you spend half your time blowing hot air across the table. You can't just write once and leave it be, the problem with design mockups and wireframes is that they don't really encapsulate the element of interactivity, and certainly lack customer feedback.<p>I also think designers and developers are very much alike even though we often bang heads. It's a creative process to write code, and I think a lot of people outside the circle don't appreciate how mentally draining ""creation"" really is.",1264959067

With music, they trumpeted the virtues of going DRM-free and allowing for dynamic pricing, while with books, they're sticking to DRM and not allowing dynamic pricing.<p>As for price-fixing, if there were multiple vendors for e-books on Kindle readers, then yes, I would agree that Amazon is not at all price-fixing. Since they are, however, the sole provider of e-books for the Kindle (more or less-- you can convert other formats to Mobipocket with mixed results, and the Kindle 2 and DX versions have limited PDF support), their insistence on uniform e-book prices can reasonably be seen as a kind of price fixing. This is part of why I opined over at Chad Orzel's blog (<a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2010/01/the_amazon_kerfuffle.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2010/01/the_amazon_kerfuf...</a>) that an upshot of this falling-out should be that in order to keep their platform viable, Amazon should drop DRM and support ePub or some other standard format.

Rule of thumb is $7000-$20,000 for a book, which must be recouped somehow. Typical book sales are <i>much</i> lower than most folks imagine -- midlist hardcover SF novels sell 3000-8000 copies at $24 discounted to $16, paperbacks sell 15-30,000 copies at $8 discounted to $6 (but with a hideous level of wastage such that typically 20-50% of the print run will be pulped due to not selling within 90 days).<p>Suppose the $15 ebook somehow sells as many copies as the $16 (after discont) hardcover. The iBook cut is 30%, leaving $10. The author's cut is another 30% of $15, leaving $5 for the publisher. They then have to defray $7-20K of production costs before they're into profit; an expensively produced book that sells for $15 but only moves 4K copies is thus a <i>loss</i>.<p>You want to know the grisly truth? Right now, ebook sales are lucky to make it into three digits. Even Baen, who are Doing It Right, are happy to shift 4000 ebooks at $6 each.<p>And Amazon isn't taking only 30% of the cover price: they're wanting 30% <i>with a cap of $10, and they get to set the retail price</i>, or <i>70% of retail price</i> (current books).<p>Let me say it again: in publishing, about 70% of the revenue stream is soaked up by rent-seeking intermediaries between author/publisher and reader.",1264958599

Anyway, check out Zarathustra, you'll either love it or hate or both. I find myself disagreeing with quite a lot of it, but then occasionally he explains himself so completely perfectly and explains reality so succinctly and accurately. The good parts of Zarathustra are like Individualism Crack, it's a huge high reading and getting excited at.<p>There's lots more on Gutenberg, too! Almost everything out of print that's well known. I got 53 books from Gutenberg the day I got my Kindle so there's quite a lot I haven't gone through yet.

However, after years of writing multi-threaded and synchronization code, I've learned that the trick is to.... abstract (?) the representation in your head.<p>If you try to ""flatten out"" the concurrency, it'll be this HUGE representation that'll never fit in your skull. The trick is to think in multiple dimensions instead of flattening it out. Sort of queue the other threads in the back of your head, and pretend you're the OS. Whenever you reach a line of code for the current thread you're ""imagining/debugging in your head"", loop over the other consumers/producers in your model and ask yourself ""what happens to this guy at this moment, or what happens if this guy was doing x, y, or z?""<p>Basically, don't hold the structure, hold the events. Expand the other objects as needed in your head, then stash them away. Don't try to hold them all in there, because they'll never fit.<p>Incidentally, since adapting to this I many times still get the urge to pick up a pen or marker and scribble down the concurrency model - except 2 seconds later I give up because it's so hard to efficiently represent multi-threaded environments/code in 2d. And that's the same difficulty you have trying to jam that representation in your head.<p>Remember the description of the components, not the components themselves, I guess.

Data grows by maybe 30k rows per day which is very reasonable given table sizes and the 128GB of ram dedicated to pg.<p>Of course, there's no way to specify the query plan.

For example, you have people with relatively small data sets that they want to fit--learning a language is about as far as they need to go.  Others end up wanting to put a user interface around it if they use it excessively or distribute it for others.  While perhaps a course on UI would be of use, for most, it's not what excites us, or advances us in our field.<p>Now, there are some who are doing high performance computing where abstraction and software engineering become important--but again, at the undergraduate level, how many courses are emphasizing the advantages of say templated C++ programming for scientific computations?<p>I think a service course on scientific computing would be of more use to most physicists than a general background in CS.  For those that will end up working on large projects, then perhaps a course on software engineering. As for math courses, maybe I was a bit weird, but didn't you learn diff. equations in high school :p?  But as for things like PDEs and such--I will say that a lot of it is learned as part of the coursework for say a first modern physics course, rather than in a math course...<p>For us, math, programming, etc. are tools that we use to do what we're interested in...(This is in no way to denigrate math or programming)",1296848245

It does not in any way absolve individuals for making dumb bets, particularly when those individuals often lied on their loan applications.<p>The housing bubble simply could not have occurred without financially illiterate people making bets they didn't understand in the hopes of getting rich quick. I agree with you that any individual bank had a more harmful effect than any individual real estate speculator, but that's just a matter of size. Collectively, real estate speculators are just as guilty as banks.<p>I don't disagree with you at all concerning bailouts. We should end ""too big to fail"".<p>But on the other hand, try to remember that real estate speculators also received massive subsidies (frannie, mortgage deduction) even before the crisis. The banks, excluding GM, have more or less paid back their portion of the bailout (this even includes the AIG portion). Real estate speculators have not paid back their subsidies.<p><i>The anger should mostly be aimed at the banks. Especially in light of their dubious foreclosure practices.</i><p>Many loan originators did shoddy paperwork to save a buck, and didn't transfer the lien's to the right party. Real estate speculators are now exploiting the legal problems caused by this shoddy paperwork to break their contracts and squat in homes they don't own. The loan originators absolutely deserve to be sued by the bond purchasers over their negligence.<p>But the real state speculators are also culpable for exploiting legal quirks to steal homes from their rightful owners [1]. We may not be 100% sure whether BankAm Loan Issuing Corp, BankAm Loan Servicing Corporation or the MBS corporation is the rightful owner of a home - but we are quite sure that the squatters currently occupying it stopped paying their mortgage and therefore do not have any right to it. The squatters deserve to be foreclosed upon, and then the loan issuer, servicer and bondholders can fight over who really owns the home.<p>Banks are a convenient political target. But real estate speculators are just as guilty as the banks.<p>[1] Obviously, not all real estate speculators are doing this, but I have read quite a few media accounts of this.",1296846274

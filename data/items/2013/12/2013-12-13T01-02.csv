6898582,comment,6893971,6894848,3,0,Lazare,,,"> The most obvious use of bitcoin is to enable peer to peer exchanges of currency without banks, that&#x27;s its purpose.<p>Well, yes.  But in general, we as a society <i>like</i> banks.  They&#x27;re big, reputable entities.  They&#x27;re easy to sue if things go wrong, deposits are insured if they go missing, and they&#x27;re subject to extensive regulation.  I&#x27;m old enough to remember when ordering stuff online seeemd weird and strange; these days it&#x27;s routine.  And in large part that&#x27;s because of standards like PCI.<p>> Setting up a website that accepts payments just became vastly easier without the need for PCI compliance<p>I know.  But PCI isn&#x27;t a wandering monster that ambushes parties of brave coders; it emerged to solve a very real problem, and it does a pretty good job of it.  <i>As a consumer</i>, &quot;look, no PCI compliance&quot; isn&#x27;t a feature, it&#x27;s a nightmare.  I only want to pay for something with Bitcoins if the process is easier, cheaper, and/or safer than doing so with my credit card.  And right now, that&#x27;s not the case; it&#x27;s not enem close to the case.  Paying for things with my credit card is very easy, quite cheap, and very safe.  Today, in the real world, Bitcoin is none of these.<p>In short, you&#x27;ve identified what Bitcoin is good at, but what we need to do is identify what Bitcoin is better than existing payment systems at.  And I don&#x27;t think &quot;startups too small or lazy to sign up for a Stripe or Paypal account&quot; is an actual niche.  Accepting Bitcoins isn&#x27;t that easy.<p>TL;DR:  You say the obvious use isn&#x27;t evading currency controls, it&#x27;s peer to peer exchanges of currency without banks.  But evading currency controls is one of the only reasons why you&#x27;d <i>want</i> peer to peer exchanges of currency without banks.  ;)",1386899362

I thought the person I was replying to wasn&#x27;t happy with the ETF fee since he was debating with the mikestew who said he just paid ETF to make the carrier switch.\n If we&#x27;re all in agreement that the current business model needs the ETF fee before unlocking, then I guess I have nothing to say. But anyone who wants their phone unlocked without paying ETF is missing the part where carriers would get screwed on high-end phones.<p>Get a $200 iphone5 from AT&T, next day unlock it without paying ETF and get a cheap prepaid T-Mobile sim and never use the AT&T sim again; thus not paying AT&T&#x27;s voice/data fees<i>(and we all know they get you on overages)</i>.

You see something you don&#x27;t like, you hit reply and <i>boom</i>, you&#x27;ve just told that person to die in a fire.  Or you&#x27;ve just retweeted it to your small but equally annoying group of friends.

That&#x27;s a non-trivial difference.  I started out (in my other comments) thinking that the difference really <i>was</i> trivial, but you actually have to think like a troll in order to understand why it isn&#x27;t.  Unless they really cared about harassing someone, the old-style block would probably be enough to stop most people from tweeting an insult, if only because it forces them to &#x27;cool off&#x27; by logging out, finding the person they want to harass, and logging back in again in order to reply.<p>I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that neither policy is really right, and there must be a more elegant solution.  But, it&#x27;s 1am here and I should probably get some sleep before trying to find the solution that has evaded the entire internet for 20 years.<p>[1] I don&#x27;t use the term &#x27;trolls&#x27; lightly.

This backdoor has a key...</i><p>It's hard to understand what this guy is talking about.  Is he claiming that the manufacturer added additional hardware that the designers were unaware of?  Or they made modifications to existing circuitry so it doesn't match the design?  It would be very hard to do either without cooperation from the designers, especially given the paranoia of hardware engineers (and of <i>defense</i> hardware engineers, an entirely different level of paranoia).  The question ""are we manufacturing what we designed?"" is one that is constantly asked throughout the lifetime of a part.  In fact the answer, for individual parts, is often ""no"", because they can be defective.  Still, the question is constantly asked with a variety of automated tools at all points of the manufacturing process.<p>Here's what I think he might have found: an additional fixed key introduced by the designers themselves into the chip, and having nothing special to do with the manufacturer.  In other words, a deliberate backdoor.",1338162468

Not only does it create kernel syscalls on the fly, but specialized interrupt handlers that handle only the devices required (if a new device requires an interrupt handler because it's being used, a new interrupt handler with the existing code and the new code is generated).<p>The generalized system call (TRAP #15, since his machine used the Motorola 68030) was fast, but a user-mode program could designate up to fifteen system calls (per thread) to be called directly via TRAP #0 to TRAP #14.  The end result---a system call was about twice as expensive as a native subroutine call (whereas in contemporary Unix systems it was more like 40x-100x times as expensive).<p>Another reason why the technique of run-time code generation isn't used that much (and is mentioned in the thesis) is that instruction caches are hideously expensive to flush.<p>But given stuff like TCCBoot (<a href=""http://bellard.org/tcc/tccboot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bellard.org/tcc/tccboot.html</a>) I think this could be a viable approach to kernels.<p>(Edit---grammar)",1338162452

It's not a matter of signed packages and security, but of corporate domination of technology and restriction of use of a hardware device you legitimately own. Would you buy a PC that restricts what OS and software you can run on it? But when it comes to smart phone and tablets, we except this. Blocking nefarious apps is one thing, having absolute control of what your computer and or smartphone can run (yes smartphones are just portable computers)is a monopoly. We wouldn't except this in any other industry. If Ford decided that you cant modify, improve or repair their products based on a restrictive license you had to agree to on purchase, you probably wouldn't buy a car from them. In the tech or media industries this is acceptable. Why should we accept a ""walled garden"" on smart phones when we own the hardware?

4031379,comment,4030489,4030489,2,0,mekarpeles,,,"In general, I tend to think of startups as children, in or around their creative prime. They are still leaning, often nave, and are expected to make a lot of mistakes (and also expected to handle them well). It seems reasonable to apologize often to potential customers because they are taking a risk and experimenting with you and your service/product. You're not so much apologizing as you are thanking them for helping you determine your target customer and their needs.<p>There are a lot of reasons why mistakes happen, but for many reasons the startup stage is a good time to make mistakes.Especially before reaching critical mass, at least from a business perspective, I believe it's easier to justify upsetting a few thousand people if it means obtaining learnings which can impact tens or hundreds of thousands of the _right_ customers (and help you serve them better) down the road. I think the smartest startups are able to minimize their mistakes by practicing due dilligence and learning from others who have made similar mistakes.<p>Large, public corporations, in many ways, face a different set of challenges.They are expected to understand their target customer, deliver product(s), maintain revenue growth, all in the face of one other interesting challenge. When you take your company public, a core group of your customers changes roles from consumer to investor. Different customers have different needs and expect different things. Some need fault tolerance, some crave features, some need speed. Because you don't necessarily choose your 'investors' at this stage, there's no saying your expectations will be aligned.<p>One challenge of running a company is, not all 'ethical' strategies (such as apologizing, if it can be considered as such) result in either maximizing revenue or maximizing customer happiness. When you have millions of customers, I imagine every important decision can be construed as a mistake by some subset of customers.<p>We live in a Peter Pan world where many startups wants to stay young forever and never sacrifice their ideals. The truth is, a company is about serving customers well, making a promise, and delivering on it. In order to do that, you need to grow with your customer base and respond to the challenges this entails.<p>Special thanks to zephyrp for editing.",1338162246

A prior is a known probability about a fact, or event, or whatever it is you are modeling.

4031346,comment,4030936,4030936,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I don't think you need fear that. Unless it is made illegal you will always be able to buy a 'computer' on which you can write your own code. However, as the great mass of folks who are only <i>users</i> of what we now call computers (web, email, twitter, what ever) move on to the appliance that replaces them, the <i>cost</i> of a computer will go up because the volumes in which they are sold will go down.<p>In '78 I paid $800 for a computer <i>kit</i> which, when assembled, was waaaaay less capable than a Raspberry Pi. But there were maybe 10,000 ever made. My prediction is that the next 'gap' will be when the big players (HP, Apple, Asus, etc) move on to selling appliances for users.<p>Laptops might get eaten in this gap. But there will be the equivalent of a terminal program in the appliance thing you are using so you can program over the network. If you want to run code on the machine that you are typing on, you may have to have a 'deskside' type computer, which is living off the ecosystem of server machines.<p>Other risks are disk drives that are too smart for their own good (built in DRM as an example). Hard to build one from scratch, but flash is ok for now.<p>Overall you'll experience the same sort of changes car enthusiasts did where cars became less and less a motor and a transmission and a body and more all of that and a complex proprietary feedback control system to run it. Of course many kids these days don't care that they can't put 'glass packs' on their ride, they have other things to customize.",1338161372

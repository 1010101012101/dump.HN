736590,comment,736038,736539,0,0,drags,,,"It's more accurate to say that this had little to no track record in the former Soviet sphere. The US had essentially no involvement (often to the despair of Soviet bloc citizens) in any of the three major uprisings (1956, 1968 and 1980-89). In fact, in the last of these (the period of instability beginning with the Gdansk Shipyard occupation in Poland, kicking up in 1988 and continuing through the ""Year of Revolutions""), US reaction was initially completely curtailed by the lack of a coherent Reagan policy on Russia/Poland. People were speaking freely, striking on a regular basis and eviscerating censorship, and the US couldn't decide whether providing increased economic assistance to Poland in exchange for continued toleration of the political situation might be a threat to detente/whether detente was really the best solution at all. It wasn't until later in Reagan's presidency that Gorbechev handed him an effective Russian policy.<p>Another thing that I think it's hard for the modern observer to acknowledge, given the benefit of hindsight, is the incredible ambivalence the Western left felt for some of these revolutionary movements. Many leftists of the 1968 generation <i>wanted</i> some form of socialism to work, and there was always a hope that an East Germany or Czechoslovakia could slowly reform into an authoritarian, yes, but competitive working-class social welfare state. The Polish uprising especially seemed to throw leftists off guard; here was a revolutionary movement dominated by conservative, Catholic traditionalists who wanted things to be _like they were before the war_. This wasn't in the discourse of the Democratic (by which I mean the party) mainstream, but it was a major element of leftist political thought of the time, and it's not hard to see how that could rub off on the measures and rhetoric American administrations were willing to take.<p>In short, the US was pretty much a nonentity when it came to ""interference in the internal affairs"" of Soviet puppet states. The ""hardline"" right was all talk and no action in deference to the longstanding policy of detente, and the moderate/radical left was too focused on criticizing American nuclear policy and too ambivalent about the broad-based dissident movements focused on individual liberties springing up in the Soviet bloc to push for intervention.",1249156550

736569,comment,735917,735917,0,0,kevinold,,,"I didn't have the eye strain problems, but did have pain in arms, wrists, under and around my shoulder blade for my right hand.  I used my right had to mouse.  Was working on a project that ""must go live"" and the last month of implementation I spent 60 hours a week coding.  Seriously.<p>Big mistake.  A day after the launch I could not type, mouse, anything with my right hand as my muscles would ache and lock up.<p>At work I had a desktop, at home a laptop.  The laptop was on a desk that violated every law of ergonomics known to man.  The chair was a cheap $79 chair I got in college from the local office supply store.  More mistakes.<p>Fast forward a year, I'd begun to notice that my right arm/hand ached all the time and the area between my shoulder blade and spine constantly held a knot.<p>My PCP prescribed pills and sent me to physical therapy.  That helped a little but the side effects from the pills made me feel drunk all the time.  The PT used a technique called ""traction"" that I later found out was chiropractic in nature.  That stretched my neck and seemed to help the symptoms.  That an excercises and an occasional pill when I had a bad flare up seemed to help manage things.<p>Fast forward another year and after an ergonomic makeover (explained below) I was hurting again and figured I'd go see a Chiropractor which my family (all Chiro success stories) suggested I go to.  Wow!  I've just celebrated 1 year of Chiropractic care and feel amazing!  It's not solved all of my issues and I still have to manage my time in front of the computer, but it forces me to use it wisely.<p>Here's a list of items that have helped me:<p>- Read everything you can about Ergonomics<p>- Buy an Elevator for your laptop - www.griffintechnology.com/products/elevator - By itself it isn't high enough for me so I have 2 thick text books under that as well to keep my eyes at a 90 degree angle from my screen<p>- Buy a good chair.  I broke down and bought an Aeron chair from a used office supply store.  One of the best moves I could have made.<p>- Take loads of breaks, stretch, excercise.  Push ups, lateral pulls, ""give yourself a hug"" all relieve tension and strain.  Find any and all stretches for your neck and upper back.<p>- Sleep.  Really, look at the code you've written when you're fatigued and look at code you've written when rested.  My CTO says that ""every programmer has 4 good hours of code in them a day"".  That doesn't mean to work 4 hours, but that you need to listen to yourself when you're ""spent"".  Accomplish the toughest tasks first thing, then once your ""spent"" do the menial tasks that take effort but little critical thinking.<p>- Go to a Chiropractor.  I kick myself for suffering literally for 2 years!  For the wrist pain, they can pop your wrists and relieve the pain.<p>Good luck and I hope my suggestions help someone.",1249155739

There was no way to really differentiate my 'friends.' My closest friends had access and were placed on the same level as those who were just mere acquaintances. Facebook has taken steps to help users establish stronger connections with certain groups of people, with their filtered news feeds, and various profile viewing restrictions, but I don't think they emphasize that enough. I will admit, that the features they've implemented have made the service more valuable and meaningful to me, because I can now share media and stay up to date with those I care to do so with, not with those I met at a conference who seemed to have tracked down my profile.<p>So yah, you can 'friend' someone who's not really your friend on Facebook, but that person can be very easily distanced. And it's probably in Facebook's best interests to focus on allowing users to establish more meaningful connections, rather than just acquiring new users. I've heard lots of radio segments recently about interviewees being subject to a Facebook profile check, and to parents keeping close tabs on their children, which ultimately makes people very image conscious, reluctant to say and share things they would've otherwise said and shared behind closed doors with their friends. So, the way I see it, the more comfortable I am with sharing information with specific groups of people, the more I'll say and share, the more Facebook will understand about the type of person I am, and the more highly targeted I am with respects to adverts.",1249153518

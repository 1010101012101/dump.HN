The doctors make lots of money.  The patient gets a new organ.  Even the organ transport companies get paid.<p>But the organ donor gets nothing.<p>In Iran, they made it legal for organ donors or their families to be compensated and the waitlist for organs cleared out in <i>one day</i>!<p>How's that for an incentive.",1261731596

One of the advantages of instant news is that there is little time for someone to weave their own views into what they write[1].  Despite how much I enjoy The Economist, its impossible to call their writing unbiased.<p>[1]  I suppose its possible to take the opposite view on this.  A responsible journalist will try to keep their views out of the article, but that is difficult and takes time, so their instant writing will be full of personal views.  I guess it depends on how opinionated the journalist is on the news they are reporting and how unbiased they want to be.",1261730490

The compiler can benefit from this information to optimize the data structure and its manipulation.<p>The exponential grow of CPU processing power has led to discard such optimizations in benefit of code simplicity. But hand held devices with limited energy, computing and storage capacity may put it back into perspective.",1261730474

I'm more upset about it being 2010 and there being no Mars bases, floating robot cities, etc.  There were some pretty clear promises made about the future when we were kids that have really fizzled.",1261730069

Also a subclass constructor should call the one of the superclass. Otherwise, a single Animal instance is shared by all subclass instances and for no reason Animal is created simply to declare a subclass.",1261729616

I know it can be abused horrifically but it can also be abused in really nice and convenient ways. If you construct you macros right they can be useful or even wonderful. In that sense the pre-processor is very C-like.<p>The things that makes macros actually nice are some of the gcc extensions, like the ({ }) block expression syntax and typeof().",1261728768

I was merely pointing out that some of the existing content publishers aren't <i>that</i> far away from figuring it out, and they have excellent existing brands on their side.<p>Interestingly, old publishing technology (delivering a mass-produced hard copy into people's hands with no way to electronically communicate a typeset soft copy) essentially acted as an anti-trust barrier for newspaper publishers - having a national newspaper monopoly was not feasible (unless a magnate would buy up every local newspaper in the country). Today there is no such limitation - there's no reason for multiple newspaper publishers to exist, in the same way there is no reason for multiple video streaming sites to exist - YouTube can take it all. I don't think we can call this a solved problem until there's a YouTube for news content.<p>I can't wait for a startup (or for one of the existing publishers) to establish an infrastructure compelling enough for <i>all</i> of the best writers from <i>all</i> newspapers to switch to it (in addition to a huge number of really good guest authors who aren't professional journalists). It drives me crazy that the NYT is sitting on an <i>excellent</i> brand and a perfect position to do it, and they're basically doing nothing about it. They hire great journalists, and provide a medium for great guest authors, but they just won't take the leap and take this to it's logical extreme. When this happens, the poor excuse for good journalism we call ""news"" can finally die off and we'll be left to consume really good, valuable content.",1261728550

And Ultimately the lack of the answer didnt matter anyway.<p>Perhaps we can just accept the answer (knowing that it could be innacurate and keeping an eye out for indicators) and make use of it? Surely that is more worthwhile - it's something of a leap to completely trust the computer, but it seems more dangerous to refuse to trust it at all :)",1245923735

All material property seems to be fair game.<p>I don't feel like any of the money the government is taking out is doing anything for my benefit (which would include social expenses - I don't mind helping the poor), and I resent being exploited.

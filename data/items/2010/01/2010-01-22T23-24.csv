1071026,comment,1070705,1070705,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I'm not really sure what real need they're trying to fill here. A single Atom core has a TDP of around 4W, performance-wise it's at about 10% of a mid range Core2 Duo, which has a TDP of around 65W, although the mobile versions are much more efficient than that (35W or so). To get 10 Atoms (or 5 if they're N300 series dual-cores) running must take much more infrastructure than a single Core2, which consumes power as well, so I doubt they're getting more FLOPS/Watt or integer ops/Watt than a Xeon or Opteron cluster.<p>So the intention must be maximising I/O. What sort of workloads are so shared-nothing that they can parallelise to this many non-shared-memory CPUs efficiently? Content Delivery Networks? Seems incredibly niche; niche enough that the CDNs probably have already built their own.<p>And what exactly is the I/O bottleneck on a Xeon system that a bunch of Atom systems can do better? FSB/Memory throughput maybe? The Nehalems already have a 192-bit, 1333MHz DDR3 memory interface per CPU and gigantic caches, along with I/O that doesn't share data paths with memory accesses.",1264204756

Not to mention a profitable one.<p>As of right now, ""Approximately 40 million Americans have chronic tinnitus. For 10 million of these people, tinnitus can be a severely debilitating condition."" according to Oregon University (source: http://www.ohsu.edu/ohrc/tinnitusclinic/factSheet.html#relieving%20tinnitus)<p>Not only that, but each of those 10 million people would be willing to spend SIGNIFICANT sums of money for viable treatments.

A proven cure for tinnitus. I'd clean out my bank account and cash in all my 401Ks, if need be, to pay for the treatment. For those who don't know what tinnitus is, just imagine having a high-pitched ringing sound in your head that never, ever, ever stops. Ever.

If the intricacies of the Reals demonstrate the philosophy they come out of, it has as much to do with predating the atom in chemistry and the Heisenberg Principle in quantum mechanics as it does with predating float-point numbers.<p>I feel that math is intended to appeal to logical intuition rather than physical intuition, so my belief is that adding limits to precision is an unnecessary complication to the number system. By extension, I don't believe that math or numbers reveal 'fundamental truths' of the physical universe, nor are they intended to. I view math as a disembodied exercise in logic, and if we happen to find a physical system that satisfies the hypotheses of a mathematical system, then the results will apply as well. The result of this is that I view the reals as 'purer' math because they have less hypotheses, and numerical approximations as a set of additional hypotheses that are more commonly seen in practice. The natural result is that there's a lot of mathematical ideals with cool properties that are ruled out in practical terms.<p>I have a few questions for you and your viewpoint (for my own curiosity, not antagonistic).<p>1. Do you believe that Pi actually does have an infinite number of decimal places, or that it's limited by the precision with which we can measure a circle? I think I read somewhere that 50 decimal places is enough to calculate the radius of the visible universe from the radius to within an atom's width of accuracy.<p>2. What do you think of the Random Oracle Model in cryptography[1]? I think there's an anology between the ROM vs real hashes, and how I conceive of the reals vs finite-precision mathematics. In particular, simple and (logically) intuitive idealized models have properties that are not held by any possible real approximation. Feel free to ask me more if you're totally confused =P.<p>3. Do you accept infinite-precision rational numbers? Why or why not? My motivation in asking is that there's a difference between computability and measurability, and you appeal to both as a source of intuition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_oracle_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_oracle_model</a>",1264201897

In this case it wasn't a list, and there was the problem of knowing if I'd already walked the entire structure, because there may have been loops, and it's the entire loop detection problem all over again.  That was one problem with trying to build the subsidiary structure.

Sadly, no, sorry.  In some sense the original problem really encapsulates the essence.

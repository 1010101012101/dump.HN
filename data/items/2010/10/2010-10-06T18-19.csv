Right now I'm totally saturated with work and it's come entirely through contacts -- I haven't talked to one recruiter or answered a single ad.  So far it's been a blast, but not quite as lucrative (yet) as working full-time for a salary.<p>In my opinion, the two major reasons I've had success finding good work are:<p>1. I'm specializing in a popular niche and, backed by my experience, I can claim I'm an expert.  This also means I can charge high rates.<p>2. I've always been a nice person to the people I've worked with and have remained friendly with previous bosses and co-workers.  I've developed a reputation as a capable programmer who's easy to get along/work with. (Conan O'Brien, last spring, attributed his success to being passionate about what he does and being a nice guy.  I think this is really true.)<p>I'm still struggling with a couple of things.  I basically always get my time estimates way wrong.  I have trouble focusing and switching contexts from wheeler-dealer (finding jobs and managing contacts) to h-core coder to my personal life.  To that end, I tend to work from my clients' offices quite a bit and I'm considering renting a cube somewhere.  Finally, being a nice guy has it's downsides--I almost never get paid promptly and clients often times don't provide as much support as quickly as I need (like when I need to work w/ a client API and I need documentation/time with their engineers to move my work forward).",1286391208

Regardless, it will be a part of their schooling.<p>Bullying ends when you end it.  There may be more than one way to accomplish this, but when you're outnumbered and out of reach of any help, you need to be able to manage the physical situation.  (This does not necessarily mean the ability to defeat an arbitrary number of opponents; it also means being able to reason ways to extricate oneself, etc.)<p>And, sooner or later, you'll be there.

Those neural pathways get burned in -- just as they do with everything else we learn particularly through repeated experience.<p>I don't want my kids to be placed psychologically in that corner.

They may want others to see them as tough, or to feel powerful or in control, or for laughs, or because they have something to gain, or because everyone else does it and they think it's normal.<p>Effective responses have to be targeted based on the motivation.  I'm not saying you need to send bullies to the psychiatrist and ""talk it out"" to understand their motivations, mind you, just that you can't expect the right response to bully A to be the right response to bully B.<p>Sometimes the right response to a bully is to be a credible physical threat to him.  Other times it may be to get to know him and make him feel respected, improving his self esteem, or to involve adults who will hand down more severe punishment, or to laugh it off, or to make fun of him, or for someone else to tell him ""that's not cool"".  The right response might even be multi-tiered, trying to change his underlying motivations, increasing the cost of bullying, and decreasing the perceived benefits all at the same time.<p>Don't leave tools out of your arsenal by mistakenly thinking you should <i>only</i> ""love on them"" or <i>only</i> ""fuck them up"".",1286390845

It's worth pointing out, though, that early on, especially in elementary school, talking it out might work, especially among lightweight bullies with more talk than physical action.<p>This reminds me of an odd story. In middle school, there was this kid on my bus who I found amusing. I mean, something about him was just comical to me. I didn't dislike him, either. I'd point this out to him and others from time to time – I think the label I'd use was ""doofy."" It turns out <i>I was being an asshole</i> and I didn't even know it. What I viewed as innocent ribbing was <i>hurting his feelings</i>. From his perspective, <i>I was a bully</i>.<p>One of his teachers came with him and intercepted me on the way to a class. She confronted me on my behavior. All at once, I saw it from his perspective and felt terrible. I started sobbing in apology, knowing at once the pain of being in his position and feeling like a monster at having slid into this most loathsome role.<p>He accepted my apology and from then on, all was well. The teacher was, I think, entirely shocked. This was the last outcome she expected, but she handled it all with grace and we were friendly after that. I'm glad he spoke up and I'm glad his teacher was on his side. It was an important moment for me.<p>Once you start to get older, though, the physical elements become very real. Moreover, not everyone is well-meaning. If it's a choice between getting damaged or protecting yourself, I agree – demonstrate strength. If I had a kid, I'd rather deal with him getting suspended, attaching a price to being physically screwed with, than lose that child to suicide or death of personality thanks to unreasoning ""human"" beasts.",1286390734

Meaning that it's entirely possible to break vast swaths of your system without warning.<p>Well, sure -- if you're a masochist.  The same is true of Debian and Fedora, too, if you bypass the user-level tools and use the underlying utilities.  If you use the user-level tools on FreeBSD, you get protections against doing that sort of thing, though.  Let me guess: you always use ""make deinstall"" instead of pkg_deinstall.  Right?<p>> I simply can't believe anyone could run a fully functional, and secure, FreeBSD system on nothing but binary packages.<p>I can't help what you are unwilling to believe.<p>> The libraries move out from under the binaries, and they simply stop functioning.<p>Are you installing libraries from ports and stuff that depends on the libraries from packages?

I have, however, had portupgrade warn me that if I installed something that required a different library version than another tool it would break something.<p>Hmm.  I guess I <i>do</i> know, and you're wrong, in my experience.<p>> I also don't understand the mindset of anyone that chooses to wait hours for their system to be useful while they wait for a huge stack of ports to build. How little is your time worth to you?<p>I don't wait hours for my system to be useful while waiting for a huge stack of ports to build.  I build stuff while I use the system.

There's actually probably a few dozen ways to achieve the same thing, including using mtree to verify filesystem integrity.<p>Come to think of it, maybe you just aren't familiar with the ports system.<p>> Yeah, I find it difficult to believe, too. It's just stupid, but it's true. You can build a pkg and install it, but then there's no way to keep it up to date via native means (except requiring the user to download and install new pkgs over time, which is unacceptable when there are dozens of packages to deal with).<p>Yeah, yeah . . . like I said, I've never had to look into the use of third-party repositories, so I wouldn't know.  I'm beginning to rethink taking your word for it, though, given your demonstrated lack of knowledge of basic ports management tools.  In fact, a cursory look at the manpages for some ports management tools suggests that the ability to specify alternate sources for ports and/or packages is provided by these tools.  I might look into this more.<p>> So, if you want to distribute a pile of applications and keep them up to date, you have to build your own update management system.<p>Even if the foregoing was true, this would not be true.  There are gobs of cross-platform options available for software management, including even repurposed version control systems.  You do <i>not</i> need to design your own software management system from scratch.<p>> people already understand how to keep their system up to date using yum or apt-get, or whatever.

People are diverse, so I won't deny that perhaps that's sometimes true.  But I think it would be more accurate to say that bullies do it because it's <i>fun</i> and above all because they <i>can</i>.<p>In short, bullies need to face punishments with teeth.  And the bullied need to have access to a justice system they can trust to actually work.  Something like this: <a href=""http://www.sudval.org/05_onepersononevote.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sudval.org/05_onepersononevote.html</a> (scroll down about halfway to ""When you were young"", A True Story).<p>Look, our justice system as adults distinguishes between aggression and self defense.  But for some reason, we treat conflict between kids as if it's everybody's fault, and everything's okay once it stops.  That's unjust, and is the root cause: adults that treat order and convenience as more important than justice.<p>When I was a kid, I remember complaining that my (three years younger) sister hit me.  The first thing my mom asked?  ""What did you do to make her do that?""  Well, of course I answered, ""Nothing,"" but it plainly wasn't true.  Who picks a fight with someone twice their size? And over the course of the discussion it came out that I had taken her toy and teased her, and you know what?  My sister got a free pass.  <i>I</i> got in trouble.<p>How about that old fashioned rule, ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all?""  How about, if I catch you insulting or belittling someone, you have to be their servant for half an hour -- get their water, sharpen their pencils, that sort of thing?<p>How about a justice system that treats allegations of teasing and insulting as serious matters, and <i>investigates</i> to get to the bottom of things?  How about a system that is concerned about kids' antisocial behavior, not because it is currently bothering the adults, but because of the effects it has on both victim and aggressor?<p>How about a system that punished physical violence harshly if it was <i>aggressive</i>, and leniently or not at all if it's <i>defensive</i>?  How about a system that says, ""If you hit back with the aim of making the other kid stop, and you stop as soon as he does, we'll hold you blameless?""  You know, the same deal adults get.  (By popular judgement, anyway, if not always in court.)<p>How about a system that responded to kids' experiments in evil with love and affection and attention, encouraging them to delve deeper and teaching them that behaving cruelly toward others is a <i>great</i> way to get all the stuff they want?<p>Never mind on that last one.",1286390271

The key is to train yourself to pick up on when you are starting to drag, and then go eat something. (I'm still working on this, it is something I have to consciously recognize).<p>I kind treat my diet as a dynamic programming problem.
You have a few variables to think about:<p>Price of food
Speed of digestion
Ease of preparation
Nutritional content<p>You can give different categories of food different values, and kind of estimate what things have better min/max heuristics.<p>Eggs are a very good morning food, for example, they're cheap, high in protein (therefore nutritionally good and digest slowly), and they're easy to prepare. Plain yogurt is similar.<p>You can do different things to get your ease of preparation and get price down. I can make a fairly healthy chili with lean ground beef and various veggies. It is mostly meat and fiber so it digests fairly slowly, and is high in protein. Normally it is relatively intensive to make it (takes me a couple of hours of time). However, if I make a big batch of it at the beginning of the week, I can freeze part of it (in reusable serving size containers) and eat it whenever. The preparation difficulty becomes similar to that of a tv dinner but it is cheaper/healthier. (Similar can be done with other soup/stew like concoctions).<p>I also keep a tin of nuts on my desk next to the computer if I need a quick pick me up.",1286390156

I tried changing all sorts of things related to my diet, but finally saw a nutritionist and doctor who were able to run some tests.<p>A stool test and a genetic test confirmed Celiac disease--meaning my body was having an autoimmune reaction to eating wheat, barley, rye, and (non-certified gluten free) oats. Celiac disease/gluten intolerance is NOT an allergy and will not show up on a typical food allergy test.<p>If you're having fatigue after you eat, I cannot recommend strongly enough that you see your doctor and specifically request a stool test and genetic test for Celiac disease. (There's also a blood test, but it doesn't work for everyone.) You may find you have it--1 in 133 of us do, but in America 95% go undiagnosed. Or you may find you have its lesser form, gluten intolerance.<p>The only cure is to completely 100% avoid gluten. It is tricky, but well worth it in terms of energy.<p>I also suggest that anyone who has Type I diabetes, Crohn's, colitis, lupus, or general digestive issues get tested for Celiac/gluten intolerance as well (via stool test if at all possible.) The tests are painless and if you find out you do have it, other weird symptoms like fatigue and joint pain may disappear if you eliminate gluten.<p>Celiac disease and gluten intolerance are genetic, so if you get tested and it's positive, your family members should test, too, even if they have different symptoms or no symptoms.",1286389760

1765150,comment,1764236,1764236,0,0,znt,,,"I guess this place has higher percentage of the bullied than other communities, so let me share my bits:<p>I was the little kid with a big head and glasses which was the equivalent of ""bully magnet"". I got beaten up during kindergarten (by kids smaller than me), got beaten up in elementary school, secondary school, high school. Bullying kind of stopped in university because bullies couldn't pass the entrance tests heh.<p>And the funny thing is, I asked my family for help while I was getting bullied. I told my father that ""These kids at school ganged up on me and while one was holding my arms the other one punched me"". His response was ""You shouldn't respond to them, they'll be gone soon"". Unfortunately, ""not responding"" while you're getting punched is not a very efficient defense technique.<p>So my dad didn't teach me how to defend myself, he didn't contact school managers, he didn't do anything. And unfortunately this happened more than once. It is very depressing for a small kid to lose his trust in his father. And that happened to me when I was 9.<p>I knew no way to stop the bullying so naturally I focused my frustration on my poor little sister. I made her cry a lot. I tortured animals. Anything weaker than me received my wrath. And all this time my father was thinking I was a bad naughty boy who should have learned some manners.<p>Every parent should know that they won't be able to protect their kids from every harm. But they can prepare them, teach them, educate them about the potential dangers they may ever face and support them if such situation arises. I never had that kind of support, but my kids will have that. Oh and they'll learn how to land a flying headbutt onto a bully's nose if they get close enough.",1286389532

Like waterlesscloud said, it looks like they ""want to be the source of all social interactions on the web without having monolithic control.""<p>This is definitely a smart move for Facebook -- be willing to give a little on data portability to position themselves as open.<p>Facebook has a gigantic ecosystem.  Thousands of sites use Facebook Connect to provide social context and are predicated on everyone interesting have a Facebook account.  A social network is a very complicated webapp -- probably the most complex many of its users interact with on a daily basis -- and literally hundreds of millions of users don't want to have to re-learn that.

I ask you to read it and think about it a moment before reacting, and comment if you disagree. I believe what I'm about to say is true, and I'm not trying to get a rise out of people - I want to fix some problems with society.<p>I feel for the author. I also moved around a lot as a kid. No, wasn't a military family. Just coincidences, reorganizations at work a few times in a row, changing jobs, family circumstances. Sometimes things went great and I fell into a group of good kids right away, sometimes they weren't so good. It's normal that sometimes the new kid gets shit. I understand.<p>A little teasing is nasty, but kids can cross the line. Something like this:<p>> John and Mike never stopped. They never gave me a day off. And while their bullying hit maximum levels within a few days of school starting, the self loathing grew until I actually hated myself. ... they started in on new bullying tactics like sneaking up and cramming food from the floor into my mouth, knocking my lunch tray to the ground, throwing dangerous objects at me, tripping me, shoving me, and pushing me.<p>That's crossing the line. Those John and Mike kids are way past any acceptable teasing/jockeying line.<p>What's the author advise?<p>> And so, I will ask you now to not hate the bullies. Experience tells me that hating them, or being angry with them, will always make it worse. Instead, put your arm around them. Love them. Tell them that they are valuable. Tell them that you expect great things from them. They will stop the bullying.<p><i>No, they won't.</i><p>This is where I'll offend polite society. I'm not doing it to get a rise out of you. I'll tell you - this is the mainstream advice you hear growing up these days. ""Love the bullies, talk it out, and they'll stop.""<p>No, that's false. That's how we got into this mess in the first place.<p>I remember I changed schools mid-year in seventh grade when we moved. I was born in August which is the cut-off date, so I was effectively a year younger than everyone else. I was 11 years old. The middle school I transferred to was 7th, 8th, and 9th grade. Just how that district was laid out.<p>A ninth grader - 14 or 15 years old, much bigger than me - pushed me into the lockers the third day at school. Hard.<p>He then laughed with his friends and started to walk off.<p>I ran after him, tackled him, and started hitting him in the face.<p>We both got suspended. No one caused problems with me after that. I found a nice group of friends and was respected. The older kid didn't cause me any problems after that either. He didn't really acknowledge me one way or the other, we were just strangers after that, which suited me fine.<p>And that's how you've got to do. This love the bullies thing - it's wrong. It ignores our animal nature.<p>I've got some sets of names I'd name my sons as they're born. They're unconventional names - Cosimo Marshall or Aurelius Marshall if the boy's mother was Italian, Zhuge Marshall if he was Chinese. The boy will likely get teased.<p>That's fine, tease back.<p>But son, as soon as someone puts their hands on you, they've crossed a line. <i>Fuck them up.</i> It's the only thing these vicious freaks understand. They're wild animals. They make violence on you, you need to show them that you're the stronger, bigger animal. When someone attacks you maliciously for no reason, you need to impose your will on them.<p>Even if you lose, lose swinging. They respect it. Be a tough fight.<p>This ""talk it out"" shit doesn't work... it's been the dogma for the last 30-50 years, it assumes the nobility of human nature will win out. It doesn't. It's nonsense. It just simply doesn't work.<p>If you're not strong enough to impose your will on someone making violence on you, then train and get stronger. If you're intelligent, it doesn't matter if the other guy is bigger than you. Take up boxing or martial arts. Brain beats brawn. Fight dirty if you have to. They shove food down your pants or whatever? As soon as he turns around, hit him in the back of the head as hard as you can. If you're much smaller, pick up a hard object and do it.<p>My Mom is awesome. She picked up from school when I was suspended. We sat in the principal's office and she was very serious, saying yes, my son is serious about school, he never gets into problems, I don't know what happened with the fight. After we left, she took me out to lunch and said good job.<p>I wished I'd learned that lesson earlier. Some people are animals. The ones that want to hurt you for no reason. Show them that you'll go to self-destructive lengths to defend yourself and avenge yourself upon them, and they'll stop. Also, protect others. I got into a shouting match protecting some McDonald's employees from a mob boss in Hong Kong. A riot cop came to break it up, I was almost in a fight with three mafia guys.<p>I had two guys try to mug me the other day in a dangerous area. Bad mistake, doubled one of them over with a kick the stomach and shouted at the other one, ""YOU WANT TO DIE? BACK DOWN, STAY BACK."" He did, he let me walk away while his criminal buddy was doubled over.<p>Should I have ""talked"" with them, ""loved"" them, these vicious criminals? No, they're animals. They don't understand.<p>Teach your kid to fight back and fight smart. Protect the weak. Be hell and misery to bad people. Pacifism only works if there's someone else that's strong around to keep things together - someone who'll stick up for you. If everyone goes pacifist except the bad people, eventually one bad person with no conscience winds up ruling.<p>No. It doesn't work. Teach your kids to fight back, fight smart, defend and assert themselves, and protect others in trouble. There's legitimately bad people in the world, barely above animals, and strength is the only thing they respect. Assert yourself.",1286389018

The rationale was that the floor show was a draw for the casino, the restaurant, the hotel itself, etc.<p>The appellate court's opinion is at <a href=""http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/886/886.F2d.1545.87-6321.87-6257.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/886/886.F2d.1545.87-...</a>",1286388180

I'm pretty ambivalent about KISS myself, but they make music which many people enjoy and which is technically pretty good by rock 'n roll standards, so what does it mean to impugn their motives?",1286388165

1765031,comment,1763917,1764501,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"More precisely, JavaScript doesn't have block <i>scope</i>. It does have syntax for grouping multiple statements into ""blocks"" (not sure if that's the right word), e.x.<p><pre><code>    if (...) {
        // block
    }
</code></pre>
It turns out that blocks don't need to follow a control flow construct like ""if"", ""while"", etc, they can stand on their own anywhere a statement can.<p>What's happening in the above case is the syntax for an object literal and a block is ambiguous. It's normally not a problem since you don't have object literals standing on their own as <i>statements</i>, you do something with them as an <i>expression</i>. On a console (or any time you eval an expression) you should wrap it in a parenthesis to disambiguate it:<p><pre><code>    ({x:1}) // expression (object with ""x"" property equal to ""1"")
    {x:1} // statement (label ""x"" followed by statement ""1"")</code></pre>",1286388075

And as you've found out, it's easier said than done for some people.<p>I sympathize: I used to be ungodly thin, with a lightspeed metabolism and no appetite at all -- often my first meal of the day would be dinner! When I started lifting weights I <i>had</i> to learn to eat enough or I was constantly feeling faint. Get used to eating. Keep snacks already prepared and eat at fixed times during the day. I ate a lot of apples, tuna sandwiches and lots & lots of milk. IIRC, I even set an alarm to tell me when it was time until I got used to eating regularly.<p>The good news is that once you've done it for a few weeks, it becomes second nature.",1286388009

It's a clever game in that it equalizes people who think about it a little with people who think about it alot, but gives both those groups an edge of people who don't think about it at all.  This makes it more accessible to people who wouldn't otherwise consider themselves serious gamers because if you try, eventually you'll get lucky and win.",1311724762

I'd be pretty concerned if this is the case - I used to work in this field for a charity providing debt advice in the UK and pretty much rule number #1 is to advise somebody of <i>all</i> of their options, including stuff like bankruptcy.<p>A service that does not do that is doing a pretty bad job imo. If you have spent any time with people who have debt problems you would know that by the time they seek help they are in a situation whereby (for a large % of cases) bankruptcy or court-ordered payment plans are the only viable option they have. Getting somebody onto a payment plan when they should be going bankrupt is doing them a huge disservice.<p>I considered some years ago going into this market myself but I could never get past the need for face to face meets with clients. Getting them to accurately provide you with enough information that you can give them proper advice is hard enough in person, let alone online.<p>In any case, I'll be interested to watch this and see how you guys get along with it. Good luck.",1311723343

The auction rule's important to this strategy - let people waste money on expensive properties, so they have no money for houses, or will at least be more amenable to trades involving cash. By the time you've bought all the greens, your opponents will have hotels on the light blues, purples and (most desirably due to the proximity to jail) the oranges, and you'll never have enough money to build any houses. That said, you can always bid just below the mortgage value of a bad property, and sometimes get lucky.<p>It partly comes down to who you play with.

2809886,comment,2807796,2808103,10,0,rjd,,,"Indeed, I never after for a job which is worded competitively.<p>I done a lot of contracting over the years. Usually 3-6 month placements and I've learnt to spot a company culture from the ad. Sort of like after you've been looking at house ads for a while you start to understand the lies that are going on.<p>Disclaimer: before reading on I'm jaded and bitter from years of dealign with a/holes, liars, and bad contracts. So its best to make up your mind as whats suits you. But my learnt experiences:<p>Worded competitively usually means you are working for a money first workplace, and the boss will usually be sleazy sales men.<p>with it you get extremely short times lines, under cutting competition, lots of pressure to finish perfectly first iteration (i.e. no time to refactor code which organic grew as you worked), and any bugs in the first and only iteration are a big deal... many projects I've worked on just don't have a testing cycle or bug fix cycle. They chew developers up and make them bitter and cynical.<p>The other ones to watch out for are ego stroking, the old ""rock star developer"". Thats usually a sign when over times come they will to pay you with ego rewards instead of money. The play will use every manipulative trick they can think of get you to work for free, and make you think you are doing it because you love it. Don't fall for that, working is a partnership and they need to offer you the respect and payment you deserve, even for work you like doing.<p>Buzz words are a keen sign you are going to be working with a bunch of sales men. It can also mean its a design agency who don't under stand what they are saying.<p>For example I've been to some great interviews listing HTML 5 as a pre-req ... where 10 minutes in I've been trying to end the interview and escape. When they tll you they are building every website in AJAX, MVC, REST, and HTML 5 head for the door.<p>IMO that is showing a lack of understanding of technologies and a failure to do proper analytical process into work. Firstly HTML 5 doesn't have great legacy support, its pre-mature in my mind to be using it for a lot of work especially considering most of these people are build simple ecommerce and brochure sites... often meaning yoga re dealing with small businesses who can't afford to retro fit when they discover 20% of the user base can't complete purchasing because of IE 6. Mobile is a different story its ready, but thats the analytical process, choose the right tool, and if you see people nailing in nails with nails walk away.<p>Another two which go instantly on my nervous list are gloating about team culture or how great the office is. I don't let these stop me chasing a job, but I do get extra cautious when going threw the interview process that those items are intact true.<p>Because in 15 years of programming I've never really had a bad team. A few toxic characters for sure, but most teams are great. Often it can actually be a good sign, they are after team fit, and that can be the best thing ever.<p>Most developers are just normal average people, usually with one freakishly intelligent person, and a few play doh eaters. ""Amazing"" teams often have several gifted people, and I don't like working in those teams to much, conflict always arises because people have cleverly thought of a solution, and instead of implementing they fight. I prefer normal teams with mixed backgrounds and age spread, so water cooler talk in the office is at least interested and I find I bond better with genuine people, and that makes them easier to deal with because I can approach them problems and negative issues.<p>I won't take a position with a crap office full stop, I'm actually effected by environment. So before accepting a job I ask to see the offices. Its extremely important to me.<p>In saying that I'm not sure what it has to the work advertisement, it usually sets off my paranoia that either the job is boring as hell and they couldn't think of anything else for the ad. Or the complete opposite they have built an nice office to stroke your ego, or compensate for work overload.",1311721760

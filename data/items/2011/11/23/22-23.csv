Completely different business models.<p>G+'s existence is used as an excuse to compare Google with Facebook, but G+ wasn't even a thought when Google IPO'd. Again, completely different business models.<p>The author then makes up the particular case of an ""Ivy League Northeast pet lovers"" demographic and says that things like Tide, Mission Impossible, car companies don't want to market to them. This is not how targeted advertisement would ever work.<p>* You market Tide to demographics that are in charge of the buying decision for laundry detergent in the household (this knowledge has been around for literally decades: soap operas) - how about people who talk about doing laundry in their status messages? Or how about people who list their children on their facebook profile and don't list an employer?<p>* You market Mission Impossible to people who say they like Mission Impossible (and similar movies/series) in their ""Stuff I like"" section or by using their ""likes"" from sources like IMDb, etc. Maybe they also check in to movie theaters regularly - especially if they often check in with a certain group of friends. Show those friends the same ad.<p>* You market cars to people who seem to have the income to afford a car (using job descriptions, maybe seeing how often and where they eat out using checkin information to get some sort of estimate on disposable income) and maybe you even filter that to people who complain about their car. On top of that you could even filter by the last time the user got a vehicle - this is now an event you can add to your timeline.",1322089094

3272134,story,,,6,3,onecofounder,"Ask HN: How to resolve my difficult cofounder situation?",,"I'm in a difficult situation with my cofounder. We're both developers and we received some grant funding allowing us to work full-time on our product since July. We have reached this point after arguments including, email exchanges, telephone calls and in person meetings. The arguments and other personal distractions effectively paralysed product development for the last two months. We are both fairly ashamed of how little we have achieved. Fortunately, while it has been a close thing at times we still have our friendship intact.<p>This is where we are at:<p>1) We have enough money in the company for us both to work full-time on our product until the end of January or for one of us to work full-time until end of March.<p>2) My cofounder has decided that regardless of the state the product is in, he doesn't want to be part of the company with me after January, he is considering getting a full-time job or switching back to consulting.<p>3) He wants to spend the next two months until then working remotely on our product while traveling around other parts of the continent we're based in.<p>4) He says he is committed to making the product profitable by the end of January so he can, one way or another, get some cash value from it.<p>5) While I trust him as a friend I am struggling to see how he can genuinely work in the best long term interests of the company while 2 & 3 are true.<p>6) We both own 50% of our company, the product we are working on is owned 50% by that company and 50% by another business that I own the majority of. (I know this is messy, the plan is to eventually spin it out into its own company with a much simpler ownership structure.)<p>7) These are October's key metrics for the product which is a freemium b2b SaaS aimed at marketers:<p>% of visitors that use the product => 84.25% (7,823)<p>% of users that sign up to trial => 3.38% (265)<p>% of users that became customers* => 3.39% (9)<p>Total reoccurring revenue => $796<p>% of customers that cancel# => 42.42% (14)<p>8) The product's biggest challenges are to fix the terrible retention rate and get back to break even (~$1300). I'm confident that I can overcome these with two months of distraction free work. I've spoken to and received feedback from a wide range of customers and I know what the problems are. I think I can solve the bulk of them by January which I believe is a great time of year for a marketing push for this kind of product. Further to this I'm confident that given four months of distraction free work I can bring revenue up to a level such that it can sustainably support me working on it full-time. Within 6 months we should be making a significant return.<p>9) Our overall (vanity) metrics for the product which started as a side project of mine in mid 2008 are:<p>Total number of unique visitors: 208,368<p>Total number of registered users: 9532<p>Total revenue since launching in August 2011: ~$3000.<p>10) As a result of the heated exchanges we've been having over the last few days my cofounder and I have agreed a ""shotgun"" clause in our partnership agreement. From Wikipedia: ""The shotgun clause allows a shareholder to offer a specific price per share for the other shareholder(s) shares; the other shareholder(s) must then either accept the offer or buy the offering shareholders shares at that price per share.""<p>11) I'm considering making my cofounder an offer for his 50% share of the company which equates to 25% of the product. My challenge is that I'm cash poor and equity rich. If I offer the limit of what I can afford to buy him out I feel I will be radically undervaluing the product and even if he accepted it would mean reducing my cash runway to work on the product down to two months. If with such a low offer he decided, instead of accepting, to buy my shares for that amount it will leave me with the same amount of personal runway to find something different to work on.<p>12) I could offer high and take on the difference as personal debt but I'm already stretched financially and I don't feel comfortable doing that. Instead I've decided to ask around and see if anyone I know is interested in backing me in attempting to buy my cofounders shares from him.<p>Three questions for you:<p>1) What are your thoughts on this situation?<p>2) Do you think I'm doing the right thing?<p>3) How much do you think my cofounder's share is worth?",1322088522

[..] I also strongly suspect this will not be a significant edge case in practice [..] If you are writing code that expects integer overflow to happen a certain way, you're doing it wrong.<p>It's a valid position to say that relying on integer overflow in one's Dart code is ""wrong"". But you will need to carefully educate coders about that, since relying on overflow is common in popular languages like C and C++. This won't be easy.<p>Another big worry is that this could lead to very hard to diagnose bugs. Having the native VM and the compiled code have different semantics in subtle ways is risky - unintended overflows will lead to different bugs in different cases.<p>Also, integer overflow is not the only case where this problem arises. It also happens with say division of an integer. Will Dart compiled code in JS add proper rounding correction to all divisions of integers? Or will this be another case where the VM differs from compiled code?<p>Overall, it seems much simpler and safer to just correct overflows in the compiled code.<p>> Especially given some of the horrible characteristics of the language [JavaScript]<p>It's fine if you don't like something of course, but I don't think calling languages ""horrible"" is going to lead to a productive discussion.",1322088449

If it were one of the organic listings, I'd have to manually create 8 cards or whatever and then upload them.  They'd go behind a signup wall.  People would then be asked to signup to the site to download the eight cards.  Very few of them would buy BCC.  Instead, they should sign up for my site, where a) they can create more cards and b) the ones who experience a lot of value from classroom bingo will actually pay me money.",1322085844

Let's disregard the clear evidence that people deliberately search for popular TV commercials in YouTube. Let's ignore the philosophical debate about whether every one of 37Signals's blog posts is also an ""ad"" for 37Signals products, or whether every one of my HN comments is also an ""ad"" for YCombinator.

If I go out to buy an electric guitar, I don't do so by clicking on the first guitar ad I see and then pressing the green BUY button. Instead, I do some kind of research. At the very least, I go to a store with a bunch of different kinds of guitar and stare at their packaging and styling. More likely, I visit the sites of a bunch of guitar makers and then choose one. But just because I chose to buy a Strat rather than a Gibson Les Paul doesn't mean that I didn't derive value from viewing Gibson's website, or reading their blurb about Les Paul.<p>Similarly, just because I'm ultimately not going to buy bingo card creation software doesn't mean I don't benefit from knowing that such stuff exists.<p>---<p>[1] Yeah, but we're discussing a cheap little low-class interstitial ad on a website, right? Should I even try to compare it to a whole fancy thirty-second spot, or a music video?<p>Maybe, because a 140-character ad is <i>better</i> for many purposes than these bigger ads.

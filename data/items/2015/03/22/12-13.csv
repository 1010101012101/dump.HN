If you account for slave labor as the cost of minimal food and housing, then it&#x27;s not only productive, it&#x27;s cheaper than almost anything else, <i>especially</i> because the slaves are property, so you can breed them and get a return-on-investment while <i>also</i> extracting labor.<p>Of course, if you account for slave labor in terms of some equivalent to wages, <i>then</i> all of a sudden society has reason to stop using slave labor and innovate <i>instead</i>.

Don&#x27;t think of them like your representatives in a stressful court case, because it is 99.54% likely that there will be no court case -- think of them as highly trained specialists in letter writing, with high tolerances for both stress and tedium, who happily sell letters to almost anyone who asks for one.<p>Send the invoice.

The latter argument, and Graeber&#x27;s vision of &quot;Hell is a collection of individuals who are spending the bulk of their time working on a task they don’t like and are not especially good at&quot; are extremely susceptible to precisely the &quot;lack of perspective&#x27; criticism raised by the OP. And unlike Graeber, I&#x27;ve met corporate lawyers who chose that line of work because they found it interesting and valuable (and I&#x27;d hazard the corporate lawyers that draft the worst contract terms and push the hardest for unnecessary litigation <i>really</i> enjoy their jobs)<p>Sitting in a corporate cubicle churning out CRUD apps on spec for customers you&#x27;re isolated from probably <i>feels</i> like it&#x27;s contributing less to society than co-founding a &quot;change the world&quot; startup that fails to achieve product market fit, but the former probably achieves more good for society, even if it&#x27;s only the sort of good that involves people having to do less paperwork manually...",1427025806

For a while the highest comment was about the design of the blog.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9238739"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9238739</a><p>> A reader emailed to complain about how this and other HN discussions often become derailed by off-topic carping about blog design. I agree completely. Could there be a more classic form of bikeshedding? It would seem parodic if it weren&#x27;t sadly real. This has become more of a thing on HN lately. It needs to become less of a thing.<p>> I don&#x27;t mean to pick on you personally, or just on this one comment. (Your second sentence alone, by the way, would have been a helpful contribution.) The problem is the tedious stampedes such comments spawn.<p>This submission is a bit different because the design of the page is the thing being submitted, but I&#x27;m aware that I too easily make comments about the design of the page rather than the content of the page.<p>Some design choices are weird and prevent people from being able read the content and I wish there was a way to provide that feedback without derailing a thread.",1427025698

To say the head of a private equity firm serves no purpose, is to claim allocating private capital in a market economy needs nobody in charge of that process at the company doing it.<p>Nearly all venture capital is private equity. Sam Altman is the President of a private equity company.<p>Private equity is not about concentrating capital, it&#x27;s about allocating capital to productive use. It&#x27;s no more vile than the stock market, which allocates capital from investors during the IPO process and afterward through the common purchase of shares.<p>Further, your comparison about slavery is obviously entirely false. An angel investor - aka private equity investor - like say Mark Cuban, who owns his own investment company and is the head of it, is not performing a function similar to slavery. Mark&#x27;s capital is his own, and it was not stolen from people held in slavery by force. There is no similarity, and one cannot simply say they&#x27;re similar because slavers were re-allocating capital too, that would be an intentionally nonsensical comparison.",1427025687

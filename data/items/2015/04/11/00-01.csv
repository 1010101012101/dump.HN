Lets say a base $150 ticket is a 32 inch pitch. Then an additional 2 inches should cost $9.38 extra, available through the exact same sales channels. And if the airline would like to play the game with your width or weight as well, then they either need to calculate based on area or specify how that $150 is divided up for the linear combination.<p>But ultimately the airlines&#x27; business is just like ISP&#x27;s &quot;bandwidth caps&quot; - when limits are set low and overages are at a much higher rate than the common, then it&#x27;s clear that the business model is based around <i>gouging</i> arbitrary people rather than honest appraisal.<p>(BTW, I&#x27;ve found airplane armrests do indeed swing up, you just have to pull harder than you&#x27;d expect to. This is really only useful on the aisle or if you&#x27;ve an empty seat next to you.)",1428713984
9357942,comment,9356482,9356482,0,0,iAMjoseph,,,"I wonder if this is more of a higher education ecosystem problem of survival.<p>Smart Universities know the winds of change are coming. Up until recently, Ivy League educations acted as a &quot;proxy&quot; of future success to employers in the industrialized world.<p>Once more short-term apprenticeship-type learning start getting &quot;accredited&quot; (hack reactor, Udemy, etc.) and talent recruiters adopt the new reality - the traditional University will begin to become irrelevant.<p>Their only hope to survive is to make surefire bets on privileged background applicants who will become alumni gifters to keep the veiled Ponzi scheme going.<p>An assertion can be made that these types of candidates following a rote program for their life since birth may have wrote about how they want to change the world in their applications (or hired somebody else to write them). But, this very same background created an entity that no longer can think creatively and keeps following the path. Some awaken. Most do not.<p>There is a strong argument that transformational leaders who truly change the world and are not good at what &quot;school&quot; says what we should be good at, and don&#x27;t think about education in this way. For example, many of these folks surely would not have been accepted at the Ivy Leagues: ( <a href=""http://www.onlinecollege.org/2010/02/16/50-famously-successful-people-who-failed-at-first/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onlinecollege.org/2010/02/16/50-famously-successf...</a> )",1428713982

9357916,comment,9355382,9357767,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Meta-comment: I believe the difference in opinion here (which seems to recur, over and over, and has for decades) is because the job title of &quot;software engineer&quot; actually encompasses many different job duties.  For some engineers, their job is to &quot;make it work&quot;; they do not care about the thousand cases where their code is buggy, they care about the <i>one</i> case where it solves a customer&#x27;s problem that couldn&#x27;t previously be solved.  For other engineers, their job is to &quot;make it work right&quot;; they do not care about getting the software to work in the first place (which, at their organization, was probably solved years ago by someone who&#x27;s now cashed out and sitting on a beach), they care about fixing all the cases where it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work right, where the accumulated complexity of customer demands has led to bugs.  The first is in charge of taking the software from zero to one; the second is in charge of taking the software from one to infinity.<p>For the former group, error checking just gets in their way.  Their job is not to make the software perfect, it&#x27;s only to make it satisfy one person&#x27;s need, to replace something that previously wasn&#x27;t computerized with something that was.  Oftentimes, it&#x27;s not even clear what that &quot;something&quot; is - it&#x27;s pointless to write something that perfectly conforms to the spec if the spec is wrong.  So they like languages like Python, Lisp, Ruby, Smalltalk, things that are highly dynamic and let you explore a design space quickly without getting in your way.  These languages give you tools to do things; they don&#x27;t give you tools to prevent you from doing things.<p>The second group works in larger teams, with larger requirements and greater complexity, and a significant part of their job description is dealing with bugs.  If a significant part of the job description is dealing with bugs, it makes sense to use machines to automate checking for them.  And so they like languages like Rust, C++, Haskell, Ocaml, occasionally Go or Java.<p>The two groups do very little work in common (indeed, most of the time they can&#x27;t stand to work in the opposing culture), but they come together on programming message boards, which don&#x27;t distinguish between the two roles, and hence we get endless debates.",1428713209

People are prescribed those medications for many different reasons all the time. The ability to drive or operate dangerous devices can be impacted as bad as ethanol, and many will impact attention or social interaction in various ways. It is difficult to compared these to marijuana, but it is obvious that some have much stronger reactions to these drugs.<p>Just like with drunk driving, the problem here is the focus on any particular drug instead of focusing on behaviors. It is similar to default-allow in computer security; trying to enumerate bad things[4] that might allow for bad behavior, the real solution is to change how the problem is framed.<p>Citizens concerned about  safety on public roads are not actually interested in how much ethanol someone has had to drink. What matters is if someone has the necessary reflexes, fine motor skills, and situational awareness to drive safely. Ethanol consumption correlates with these problems, with a <i>lot</i> of variability. Instead of the breathalyzer, we should be testing the features that actually matter. This might suggest that some people cannot drive even when they are <i>sober</i>... which is kind of the point.<p>If someone shows up to work under the influence, you should evaluate if they are causing any sort of <i>actual problem</i>, and fire them for that.

But at the end of the day, it appears anything you can build on ethereum you can build on bitcoin.<p>Beyond that they did this huge crowd funding which was quite strange, not through investments or donations (ownership or charity/support), but rather through selling ethers, which is a bit like an API selling an access token. Only the ethers sold for upwards of $15-20 million as far as I remember, while not having any real value, and not being necessary in large volumes for developers to work with. They said it wasn&#x27;t an investment, yet sold it as such. Nobody got any ownership, yet people didn&#x27;t give them $15 million+ out of charity or support, either. They also had this strange scheme where the price continued going up, again, as if it was an investment that was &#x27;on sale&#x27; and if you didn&#x27;t buy now, it&#x27;d only become more expensive, in the span of like a few weeks while whatever you were supposed to buy (ethers) didn&#x27;t go up in value, and in fact, remained non-existent as you couldn&#x27;t use them as it my next point: vaporware.<p>Sot the fact it&#x27;s still vaporware (can change, but factually speaking its vaporware today) and the fact that nothing ethereum does can&#x27;t be done on existing platforms, which unlike ethereum actually exist, work, are used by large companies and has network effects, and the focus on Vitalik being some brilliant 20 year old next Zuckerberg, it&#x27;s very much reminiscent of pump & dump.<p>We&#x27;ll have to see.

You don&#x27;t have to follow them all,  but if they can help you, i&#x27;m glad :). My tips are &quot;collected/memorized&quot; for losing weight and improving health.. ( both go hand in hand)<p>Just been hitting the gym since one month, have seen a awesome progress in a short amount of time. So in terms of sports, i&#x27;m currently highly motivated. So excuse me if i&#x27;m being rude as &quot;pushing your limits&quot;. I set up my goals for now ( 1/4th marathon, ...) to know what i want to accomplish )<p>Fyi, i quitted &quot;sporting&quot; after 6 months because i had an accident with my car. I couldn&#x27;t train for 2 months and my motivation ( including having pain when doing sports), was gone for a while.. Been regretting it i didn&#x27;t start sooner :(<p>- Run in the morning after a protein shake ( most effective, so it won&#x27;t break down any muscle). You could also do rope skipping. To lose weight, you need a minimum of 25 minutes of cardio ( regular speed) or a HITT workout ( when you&#x27;re experienced in the sport you are doing, it requires less time)<p>- Sleep enough ( i only sleep 3-4 hours per day :s, that&#x27;s not enough) - Sleep is really important :s<p>- No alcohol ( it slows down your metabolism). I like green thea ( real one, not lipton), it has multiple health benefits and improves your metabolism<p>- If you use the weight scale, use it on a weekly basis. Not daily. A mirror is better then a weight scale in a lot of cases. Sometimes you are building muscle => more weight on the scale<p>- Measuring your fat percentage gives a better accuracy about your body then bodymass index. The easiest way is electrolyse, but not always very accurate (eg. when you drink a lot of water => ah well, life ain&#x27;t perfect. But this is the easiest method )<p>- Strength training ( more muscles = higher metabolism = more burning fat while eating the same) in the evening.<p>- Women don&#x27;t acquire muscle that easy, it&#x27;s more efficient to do more cardio when you are female..<p>- Some people just don&#x27;t get fat. Get over it, they aren&#x27;t you. If you want to build muscle, they&#x27;ll be jealous though ;-) .<p>- Strength training with a high heart beat burns more fat (eg. 1 minute rope skipping, 2 minutes dumbells push)<p>- Limit your sugar intake<p>- &quot;Healthy&quot; products that are popular are probably not very healthy. ( eg. Kellog&#x27;s K => way too much sugar). I have always found &quot;something off&quot; with it. Healthy is also a marketing term :)<p>- Sugar =/= sugar. You have allowable sugars ( Dextrose => found at pharmacy and fructose ( in fruit)). Those are the ones you want, if you need them<p>- Eat regular, but don&#x27;t eat to much ( never be fullfilled and never be hungry is how i call it). I don&#x27;t count kcal, because i hate that.<p>- The sooner the day, the more time you have to burn your carbs. The closer to the night, the more protein your food should contain ( while you sleep, you store carbs in your body)<p>- Have good food choices, less carbohydrates when you are nearing bedtime. Last meal approx 2 hours before going to sleep.<p>- If you want results, do it a minimal of 3 x / week ( cardio, strength training)<p>- Never be hungry!<p>- Read about what you do or why you do it ( eg. Tom Venuto - Burn the fat, feed the muscle)<p>- Workout according your capabilities, sport is 40% of losing weight. 60% is having better food choices.<p>- Don&#x27;t start alone, but be prepared to continue it alone though ( eg. partner is not going to the gym, just go alone )<p>- You don&#x27;t need to constantly to give it a 110%. You can have a cheat meal every 4 days as a reward ( Because of a hormone called Leptine in your body) - have a rest day ( Sunday)..<p>- A human can live for a month without food, it&#x27;s because the body limits the energy wasting to crucial organs.. You don&#x27;t want that, you want your metabolisme to be as high as possible. So don&#x27;t eat to little! Food is important<p>- Know your bad habbits<p>- Do, what you can continue to do, on a regular basis.<p>- Have goals ( what do you want in 2 weeks, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years) - it&#x27;s for your motivation. Write them down<p>- You need at least one supplement ( protein shake). I use multiple ( fish oil and high vitamines ( A + B ) ) and protein bars with a minimum of sugar as a snack<p>- Listen to your body, if you are hitting it to hard on eg. running... Then just run less, walk or don&#x27;t run for a while.. Run again when you can<p>I&#x27;m writing this as a 27 male. I always go extremely fast, extremely hard... If you can&#x27;t handle it, no problem. Build up untill you can. Eg. for running, stretch REGULAR ( like every 2 minutes) so you won&#x27;t get cramps. Find out what your recovery speed is ( eg. 8.5 km/u.) and do HITT to improve your recovery speed. HITT is hard and you should only do it when you can handle it though...<p>If you hit the gym for one hour, make it difficult for yourselve. It&#x27;s the same amount of time as doing nothing and you&#x27;ll feel a lot better. If you can read a magazine while doing &quot;sports&quot;, you&#x27;re not doing it right and i wouldn&#x27;t call it sports, it&#x27;s called reading.<p>My body type is Endomorph, so i gain weight really fast ( but also muscle). Know what your body type is :)",1428710967

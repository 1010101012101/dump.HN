I've been using it since the 90s, and actually paid for it back when it displayed an ad for free users! It just has so many useful little extra features, and I generally trust them not to use my data for nefarious purposes.<p>If this happens--and I've seen nothing as yet to suggest it's anything other than a rumour to get the pageviews up on certain tech blogs--I'll be uninstalling it after nearly fifteen years of use, and probably making the move to Firefox. I don't have a Facebook account, so why would I want to use a Facebook browser? Instead of just tracking me across Like-enabled sites, it'll be able to follow me around the whole internet, logging goodness knows what.<p>I seem to remember a social networking browser was tried out before, as a forked Firefox and subsequently Chromium, in Flock. Whatever happened to Flock?<p>I paid for Opera years ago, and I'd actually pay real money again for a good quality, feature-filled browser that was guaranteed to not include tracking. I'd rather pay with my money than my privacy. Money can always be replaced, and earned again. Once privacy's gone, it's gone.",1338288992

It has been a long time as my preferred default browser for home and work PC's. I'd even have it on my iPad if I could.<p>But when I first heard this rumor over the weekend I felt in shock (and sick). I hate Facebook along with its smug a-hole founder. Never even had an account (although I do feel I missed out on some old connections and such but refused to be a part of FB). From a business standpoint I guess it makes sense. FB would get a mature, fast and feature rich browser (One they could data mine to no end, including emails).<p>But the very last version of Opera that was released, shall this buyout happen, will also be the last version I ever use. Opera has a very clear and good privacy statement. I trust Opera. But Facebook, forget it!<p>In past few days I have spent time downloading and trying pretty much every other popular browsers.

I took the decision that testing behaviour, and thus introducing the Django ORM early on, would be better in terms of what the students are learning...  I think that a discussion of how you could re-write those tests without using the database, perhaps in a later tutorial, would definitely be a good idea, and it could then take in some of the pros and cons of making things maximally granular...<p>I spend a bit of time later on discussing ""testing philosophy"", ie what to test and what not to test - I'd be interested in your feedback on that?<p><a href=""http://www.tdd-django-tutorial.com/tutorial/3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tdd-django-tutorial.com/tutorial/3/</a>",1338287595

There are subtle differences in the API.<p>When you go deeper, there are a few more differences which mostly come from the hardware. Programming two different devices with OpenCL can be very different if you want to write efficient code. The difference between programming for different pieces of hardware is much larger than the difference between the API's used.<p>As a single vendor effort, CUDA moves forwards faster and has support for more of the latest GPU features.

First, the underlying theoretical model simply throws the kitchen sink on the RHS of the equation, with little to no economic motivation given for why the chosen independent variables were hypothesized to explain the variation in the dependent variable.<p>Secondly, only a tiny fraction of economists today actually use any statistical learning methods. Economists still don't do much prediction -- as in ""predicting tomorrow, today"", or even ""predicting today, today"" -- both of which differ from forecasting.

Then there are the contextualists, who would have us believe that people behave as the system dictates and can be held blameless for their failings.<p>The truth is, naturally, somewhere in between. We can suggest that people are negatively influenced by certain things without denying them free will and personal responsibility.<p>> <i>""It's not your choice, it's not your life, it's none of your business.""</i><p>Note that Mr. Mullenweg didn't suggest that systems be designed to actively curb this behavior. There are no Big Brother nor Nanny State overtones to this at all.<p>> <i>""If people want to spend their time reading blogs and Twitter, who are you to say otherwise?""</i><p>Again, nobody has tabled that we should <i>disallow</i> people from reading blogs all day. Mr. Mullenweg seems to be feeling guilt that he's helped create something that may have a negative overall impact on many of its users.<p>Imagine if you've created the world's most addictive cigarette and completely cornered the market. People all around the world are lighting these things up by the packloads. You wouldn't feel any concern, or even guilt?

This is the nation that, after all, invented the TV dinner and the couch potato. In fact, TV's influence on society is a <i>big</i> can o' worms. If Mr. Mullenweg wants to feel better about his role in the creation of new media, he may want to take note that the Internet is the first thing in 50 years to get people off the damn couch and onto a far more interactive, more informative medium. The Internet has some serious information addiction problems that we're just scratching the surface of - but IMO it beats the pants off what it replaced.<p>Information addiction <i>in general</i> does not have me overly concerned about the future of society and the Internet.

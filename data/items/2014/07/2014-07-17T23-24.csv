8050941,comment,8050761,8050761,2,0,chrissnell,,,"Here&#x27;s my take.  I grew up in my parent&#x27;s brick-and-mortar retail business: a four-store bicycle shop that&#x27;s one of the largest and busiest in the nation.  We were an early pioneer on the Internet, one of the very first to sell bicycle parts online back in 1995.  These days, they don&#x27;t do much e-commerce but brick-and-mortar business has grown a lot and the management is still tech-savvy.<p>Here are the problems that I see:<p>1.  Employees are busy.  In the bike shop, you&#x27;re constantly running around, helping this customer and that customer, answering the phone, taking in a repair, doing a demo, etc.  It&#x27;s going to be very hard to get someone on a computer or iPad to do live chat.  If an employee is typing on a computer within sight of a customer, the customer will assume that they aren&#x27;t busy and will interrupt them with a question.   The problem is so bad that when my father would go out onto the sales floor to fix a computer, he would put on a fake badge that said something like &quot;DataTech Computer Repair Services&quot; so customers wouldn&#x27;t think he was a shop employee and interrupt him.  Perhaps a speech-to-text interface might work but how is that better than a simple phone call?<p>2. Non-technical employees (most brick-and-mortar employees) are slow, inaccurate typists.  Back when my parent&#x27;s store was heavy into e-commerce, we quickly found that we needed dedicated guys to take online orders over the phone because most of our guys couldn&#x27;t touch-type.  If your interface requires a lot of typing, the employees and the customers using it aren&#x27;t going to be happy.",1405641531

8050928,comment,8042618,8047448,1,0,roel_v,,,"Well that my post wasn&#x27;t nice is I think indisputable, but I wasn&#x27;t saying that you&#x27;re arrogant <i>because</i> you&#x27;re French, just that the arrogance exhumed by your post reminds me of more often observed behaviour of your fellow countrymen. But let&#x27;s not dwell on that - it would be silly of me to claim that something in the ink of your passports influences your behaviour.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure how I suggested you like social inequalities - if anything, I&#x27;m more inclined to think that you dislike them so much, that you deny their existence in cases where there obviously are. Apart from Catholic schools not costing 25k in Australia (I&#x27;m not even sure what the relevance of that is, but I know for a fact that the Catholic secondary school I went to a fundraiser for last year in Adelaide costs around 1000 AUD a year, and other Catholic schools in the greater Adelaide area cost the same; figures that are corroborated by the data I can find online for the rest of Australia). You seem to basically be denying that there is racism, or discrimination of muslims, in France? Are you serious? Because if that is what you&#x27;re arguing, based on &#x27;a vice principal was a muslim, so there is no discrimination&#x27;, then I don&#x27;t even know where to start in refuting you.<p>Your further argument is even more laughable and not only that, but plain wrong. You seem to be saying that the existence of words in a language indicates something intricate about the culture or society in which that language is used. That Inuit have 27 (or 30, or 50, or 100&#x27;s) of words for the same thing is plain wrong, and the linguistic debate about what a &#x27;word&#x27; means and how that relates to the Inuit language is not very relevant here (but you might want to start with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow</a> and <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/there-really-are-50-eskimo-words-for-snow/2013/01/14/e0e3f4e0-59a0-11e2-beee-6e38f5215402_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/there-...</a> ). What is certain though is that the premise you derive from it, doesn&#x27;t have merit.<p>So pray tell, what then makes your assertion of &#x27;we don&#x27;t have bullies because we don&#x27;t have a word for it&#x27; more valid than e.g. my assertion &#x27;the French are in denial about bullying because they don&#x27;t even have a word for it&#x27;? (Apart from that I still don&#x27;t agree with you on that point - there are plenty of ways French newspapers manage to express the concept every time another suicide because of bullying is in the news).<p>What enrages me most (well, not enrage, just annoys enough to spend 10 minutes to type this), is that instead of saying &#x27;yeah maybe I kinda mis-expressed reality by making generalizations from what is probably a myopic point of observation&#x27;, you basically make it even worse by saying &#x27;not only do we not have bullying, we don&#x27;t have racism or any other form of discrimination either&#x27;!

When it comes back online, if the detectors reach design sensitivity, it&#x27;s sufficient to make detection of gravitational waves from neutron-star inspirals probable. As both LIGO and Virgo are down for upgrades, there&#x27;s no chance of a major new detection from either until they&#x27;re re-commissioned and running well (timescale of ~year+).<p>As reported at a workshop at the Institute for Nuclear Theory here at the University of Washington a few weeks ago, the Advanced LIGO upgrades have been going quite well; the riskiest work is coming toward a close.<p>The linked article makes no claims that there&#x27;s anything new being dredged out of past science runs on initial/enhanced LIGO (which remains possible, if unlikely).",1405641269

You should only have one kind of reference, but if you use it correctly the compiler should figure out how to free it.<p>This has been an area of intense research for four or five decades now, and it&#x27;s probably not going to get better than what we have now, in the general case. In the presence of general recursive data structures, the compiler can&#x27;t know when each object is going to die. I&#x27;m pretty sure you can easily reduce this to the halting problem.<p>To date, you&#x27;ve had three sorts of solutions: 1) explicit malloc/free; 2) tracing GC or reference counting + various tricks to take advantage of special cases; and 3) putting additional information in the type system to help the compiler infer when objects might become free while preserving memory safety (this is the direction taken by Rust, Cyclone, MLKit, and to an extent C++ too).",1405640880

EC2 instances will drift a lot over their lifetime, so if you&#x27;re not running NTP you will likely eventually fall outside the portknocking implementation&#x27;s grace period, and then be unable to access your server at all, short of rebooting it or figuring out how skewed the clock is.

I find I can switch back and forth almost fluently, though I do have to look at the keyboard when typing on qwerty in order to switch my mind into that mode. As a test, I typed the last two sentences on qwerty and it was a bit painful, but not too slow. Maybe 40wpm. I hit 80 on dvorak without thinking.<p>The biggest thing I notice when going back to qwerty is how horrendously uncomfortable it is. I feel like I&#x27;m doing contortionist exercises with my fingers, and my wrists start aching very quickly. Going back to dvorak after that is like switching to the &quot;walk&quot; section of a walk/run interval training session.<p>I agree with kingmanaz that words just roll off your fingers. Dvorak is like cooking in a kitchen where everything you need is in just the right spot and you can grab it without moving, versus qwerty where everything is over the place and the spices are opposite the stove. You can still cook, and even do it quickly if you know where everything is, but you wind up expending so much more energy moving around.<p>I did have problems at work when co-workers needed to use my keyboard to do something on my machine. The universal reaction is &quot;what&#x27;s wrong with your keyboard&quot;, sometimes with gratuitous profanity thrown in. Maybe 10% of people realise that it&#x27;s dvorak without me having to explain. A handful try to hunt-and-peck before giving up and making me do it. One person surprised me by knowing dvorak as well. So, I had work buy me a hardware-switchable dvorak keyboard that has double-labelled keycaps (qwerty in small blue letters). That&#x27;s solved the problem.<p>Gaining dvorak fluency in the first place took me about 3 weeks of inability to type, which was hell on a shy geeky 16-year-old whose main social interaction was IRC channels.<p>The one place I still use qwerty is on my phone. Dvorak is very poorly suited to thumb typing because it breaks autocorrect. Most of the time when you mistype a word, it&#x27;s still a valid English word, because all the common letters are next to each other.",1405638937

I&#x27;ll likely stick with React for another project or two, unless i conceptually have an &quot;ah hah&quot; moment with Polymer.. but until i can render Polymer serverside, i&#x27;ll always be longing for React.<p><i></i>edit<i></i>: Come to think of it.. If someone could bake html imports and shadow dom into React, i may be in heaven.",1405638452

8050752,comment,8049180,8049739,3,0,mountbob,,,"> Once urandom is initialized, the idea that it can ever &quot;run out of entropy&quot; is nonsensical; urandom is structurally the same as a stream cipher keystream generator, and we generally don&#x27;t fret about whether AES-CTR keystreams will &quot;run out of key&quot;. Nonetheless, the belief that urandom will sporadically &quot;run out of entropy&quot; is virulent.<p>Something doesn&#x27;t add up.  Supposedly the reasons for creating urandom were to avoid blocking - but at the same time all the docs warn about entropy depletion.  Are you now saying this is meaningless?   If so, then why ever use /dev/random?",1405638328

Before you scale...run the startup like a small business not a side project\n#3. Test, Iterate, Repeat\n#4. Unit economics are king\n#5. Everybody has to hustle (i.e..do whatever it takes to get something done..i.e sales and execution)\n#6. Action trumps pontification\n#7. Team culture and mutual respect is the foundation for success. Great teams are like cults!\n#8. Put together processes, standards and systems for everything (values, hiring, firing, expectations, roles, sales, etc.) and ensure everyone is accountable to those standards\n#9. If you are overly stressed it’s because something is wrong with the timing, idea or team. Don&#x27;t stress, just fix it\n#10. Success comes from your peers helping you out. Find a knowledge sharing group of like minded founders, preferably in the same vertical and join it\n#11. To build a startup, you must self realize (let go of fear, doubt, ego, shame, identity) and double down on your personal power\n#12. It&#x27;s all about sales...everyone founder has to be willing to learn how to SELL (leverage relationships, PR, market, brand, bring on partners, etc.)\n#13Differentiation comes from the heart not a textbook",1405638122

736224,comment,733390,735893,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"Not sure how hardcore I am, but I would definitely consider myself a ""linux type"". I take your point about the lack of a decent package management system. I run Debian on my ThinkPad so I know what a good package management system looks like. I also take your point about Macs being a more closed system.<p>But for me, being a web developer who doesn't do much in the way of kernel hacking or other deeper system type work, OS X really is effectively Linux (or Unix as the case may be) with a more polished interface. I would never have considered getting a Mac if OS X was not based on Unix.<p>I am much happier with a combination of OS X on my desktop (used for work plus multimedia entertainment) and Debian on my laptop (used for work) than I was with Windows on my desktop and Debian on my laptop.",1249127246

736217,comment,736034,736160,0,0,bmj,,,"True, but what about people who live in small towns or rural areas.  I'm not talking about suburbia--many of those people made conscious decisions to live far away from their work and amenities.  Or do we just tell those people they really need to make a sacrifice and move to the city?<p>I appreciate this perspective, though.  I've ridden my bike to work for the last eight years.  My family lives in the city (I live not far from where I grew up) and we use public transportation. And I agree with the Economist--this program is really about getting people to buy new cars.<p><i>Cars? People still buy those things?</i><p>Yes.  Why not?  They're a tool, just like everything else.  My family really enjoys traveling, so we (four of us) own one car.  More often than not, it's parked in front of our house.  We walk, bike, and bus ourselves around when we can.  But it's also nice to be able to leave the city on the weekend and go camping and climbing.  Or visit family.  Acting as if you are on a higher moral plain because you can't comprehend why people still buy cars doesn't do much to advance the conversation and convince people to rethink some of their lifestyle choices.<p>That said, as I mentioned, I think this subsidy is a terrible idea.",1249126092

736213,comment,736211,736211,0,0,onreact-com,,,"""Why personal change does not equal political change""<p>Good point but in fact you need to reach critical mass for the personal change to become change on the whole. When a large enough number of people changes in private the private becomes truly political.<p>If you just change in private and don't tell anybody you might nit change anything.<p>With critical mass you should of course apply pressure tactics to gain momentum. The boycott or recently the ""carrot mob"" are great examples of that.",1249125536

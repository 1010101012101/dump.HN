You can mix and match (at least, until a new motherboard standard); you can replace parts (at least, while they&#x27;re still made).<p>One problem with mobile phones is that they haven&#x27;t been fast enough - by tightly integrating every part, you can maximize efficiency to get the best out of the hardware. Apple does this fantastically, whereas Android is more modular, and so isn&#x27;t quite as efficient.<p>But now that the iPhone 5S is 40x-56x faster than the first iPhone, speed doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue, in practice or theory.

6385312,comment,6380620,6381411,1,0,ht_th,,,"> about removing quotes from strings, I tought about it, and I think as long as some other display property is different (to differentiate the number 4 from the string &quot;4&quot;)<p>The problem is that for most people the technical and subtle difference between 4 and &quot;4&quot; does not have any meaning except that &quot;the system&quot; apparently differentiates for some reason. Subsequently they will (implicitly) attach some meaning to the difference, but, as they don&#x27;t have a background in information, their understanding probably does not correspond with the reasons why you implemented this difference. For example, they could think that &quot;4&quot; means &quot;about four&quot;, or &quot;four is important&quot;, or &quot;four&quot;, or whatever.<p>Unless the difference between &quot;4&quot; and 4 is or becomes relevant to the user, the user should be prevented to have to differentiate between the two. And &quot;because the system asks for it&quot; doesn&#x27;t really make it relevant to most users.<p>I do understand the problem, of course. Without some function attaching meaning to the JSON fields, a program cannot know if a 4 has to be 4 or &quot;4&quot;. That means you have to make a rule one way or the other. The question you should ask yourself is: which one is best in your situation given the audience you target. Possible rules:<p>- a numerical number on its own, however written, is interpreted as 4 instead of &quot;4&quot;. So, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;  4&quot;, 4, &quot;  4 &quot; will all be interpreted as 4.
- all primitive fields are all strings. The program has to attach meaning to them. So, 4, &quot;4&quot;, &quot; 4&quot;, are all &quot;4&quot;
- there is a difference between &quot;4&quot; and 4. If you want the number, use 4, if you want the text four written in numericals, use &quot;4&quot;.",1379159765

Poor is a state of mind.<p>But, I&#x27;ll argue that it&#x27;s not a state of mind that the poor take on themselves.  &quot;Poor&quot; is a distinction that others will give to you, not the other way around.  Being poor is about being relegated by the other members of society.  It&#x27;s about being isolated, segregated, and honestly, constantly dealing with all sorts of mean-spirited people who believe they could have made better decisions...obviously.<p>Please try to imagine living a world where you&#x27;re the lowest status person around, where the kids and adults look upon you in disgust.  Imagine no support network, few friends, and a life void of most conveniences.  Is it better than the poor of other countries?  Maybe.  I don&#x27;t know.

I think the biggest thing that was rather off-putting about this project is that it seems that you&#x27;re selling it as throwing Javascript blobs to the client to render, instead of as a primarily server-side templating system, which makes a lot more sense. However, it does lead to a request to put in support for ARIA tagging ( <a href=""http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria</a> ), because if anything, baking accessibility support like this into a templating language makes it easier for people to reach disabled people who want to view sites.<p>I&#x27;ve got to apologize for the harsh tone of the original posting. I have a few friends who are either legally or totally blind, and have had to help them try to find software that is reader-compatible so they can interact with the world around them. So seeing the &quot;everything is dynamic&quot; ability sold as the big reason to use this templating language, and knowing that readers can get confused if there&#x27;s a lot of weird actions going on with the DOM, made me frustrated that there was yet another tool made that will further alienate these people, and make it harder to use one of the most awesome tools made for communications.

You miss read.<p>Well, now it isn&#x27;t clear what you mean at all, because you&#x27;ve said you advocate Weight Watchers while also advocating a simple belief that &quot;it&#x27;s physically impossible for a body to gain weight if it&#x27;s burning more calories than it&#x27;s using&quot;. The people at Weight Watchers are very clear that &quot;we know that a calorie isnt just a calorie&quot;: they advocate modifications in the kinds of things that you eat and the way you live your life that will lead to a healthier body and, as a side effect, weight loss; in the process, they have a fairly complex equation that assigns &quot;points&quot; to different food items based on a bunch of different quantifiable metrics. This is exactly the kind of &quot;too complicated&quot; advice that you complained at glaugh about.",1379156914

I fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a program (see git://git.gnu.org/womb/hacks.git) that fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to me. Then I look at them using a web browser, unless it is easy to see the text in the HTML page directly. I usually try lynx first, then a graphical browser if the page needs it.<p>I also browse from other people&#x27;s computers, with their permission. Since I don&#x27;t identify myself to the sites I visit, this browsing can&#x27;t be connected with me.<p>One consequence of this method is that most of the surveillance methods used on the Internet can&#x27;t see me.<p>Another consequence is that I never pay for anything on the Web. Anything on the net that requires payment, I don&#x27;t do.<p>I would not mind paying for a copy of an e-book or music recording on the Internet if I could do so anonymously, and it were ethical in other ways (no DRM or EULA). But that option almost never exists. I keep looking for ways to make it happen.&quot;<p><a href=""http://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html</a>",1379156456

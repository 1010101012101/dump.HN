Sure, people do disagree on things that involve them personally, but <i>they aren't the only ones acting</i>. Very often, people make judgements about matters that may <i>later</i> involve them or people they empathize with, on either side. These future people may or may not have had previous experience with the thing, but all that is required for them to act so as to lower expected injustice is that they empathize with someone on both sides. This act can be both unjust and reduce injustice, as long as the process is ongoing (so that the expected injustices and participants materialize).",1297511819

2209871,comment,2208159,2208159,0,0,atlantic,,,"Uncontrolled acceleration is a real phenomenon, although I don't think it is Toyota-specific. This happened to me half a dozen times when I owned an Opel Corsa. While going uphill in low gear for long periods (usually in mountainous terrain, in the French Alps), the car would suddenly bound forwards for no reason, and keep going on a steep uphill even if I took my foot off the accelerator. I had a couple of near-misses with oncoming cars and rock walls.<p>I don't know how this works if you have automatic transmission, but the principle must be the same. If you drive at very low speeds for prolonged periods, especially on uphills, the effect would probably be replicated.<p>Presumably, this effect would hit learners more than experienced drivers, since the former have a tendency to stick to low speeds and/or low gears.<p>I don't have an explanation, but from the accompanying noise I know it was something taking place within in the combustion engine itself. It was not a problem with the brakes or transmission.",1297511430

Therefore, temperature is tied directly to the mean kinetic energy of particles moving relative to the center of mass coordinates for that object. Temperature is an intensive variable because it is independent of the bulk amount of elementary entities contained inside, be they atoms, molecules, or electrons. In order for the temperature of a system to be defined, the system must be in thermodynamic equilibrium. Temperature may be considered to vary with position only if, for every point, there is a small neighborhood around that point can be treated as a thermodynamic system in equilibrium (i.e. local thermodynamic equilibrium). In the statistical thermodynamic approach, degrees of freedom are used instead of particles.""",1297511413

2209868,comment,2201469,2209689,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"No, the actual criterion being used here is what <i>is simplest according to Kolmogorov complexity</i>. In other words, Occam's razor. Nothing to do with human intuitions.  If you have Occam's priors, then MWI is far more probable than OWI, and the fact that physicists thought about it later simply doesn't count. (Well, it counts in the social process that is Science, but Science is different from Occam's priors + probability theory).<p>Anyway, MWI is irrelevant with respect to cut & paste transportation.  Just remember that perfect equality in QM is different <i>in kind</i> from almost perfect equality.  Meaning that even with imperfect instruments, the result you obtain with perfect equality are <i>wildly different</i> from the results you obtain otherwise.  Way past the margin for error of the instruments we have.<p>Yes, the theory says that there is a way for testing something perfectly, with imperfect instruments.  By some miracle, the theory is the Kolmogorov-simplest one we currently know that match the experimental results. By another miracle, the theory is (as far as I know) uncontroversial up to MWI vs OWI.<p>Another thing the theory says is that the notion of identity should be thrown out the window.  That applies to small factors in configuration space (particles) as well as large ones (paintings, human bodies). It doesn't say we should treat small factors differently than large ones.  So basically, if you manage to make a copy accurate up to thermal noise, you got yourself a second original.  And if the ""original"" original were destroyed, well, what's left is the ""copy"" original, which actually is the original, period (because identity doesn't count).<p>I'd be surprised to learn that this argument is controversial among physicists.",1297511225

Sedgewick considers and analyzes several variants of quicksort in his thesis, and I've quickly discovered that he analyzes and dismisses the dual-pivot variant under a different name. I don't know whose analysis is better, but it does follow that we shouldn't treat dual-pivot qsort as an original invention (not to detract from Vladimir Yaroslavskiy's doubtless ingenuity).<p>Here's an excerpt from the email I wrote to Prof. Sedgewick back then; he didn't reply, so I've no idea what he thinks about this:<p>""I believe that your PhD thesis studies this under the name of ""double partition modification"". I could find no real difference between the two algorithms. Yaroslavsky claims to achieve a factor of 0.8 improvements over the standard quicksort on the number of exchanges (neutral on comparisons), while your analysis led you to reject the technique after concluding it required many more comparisons than the standard quicksort. I've only attempted very cursorily to reconcile the math; it seems that both your thesis and Yaroslavsky arrive at 0.8n(log n) as the average number of swaps, but you have (1/3) n(log n) as the average number of swaps in the classic algorithm while Yaroslavsky has 1.0 n(log n) for the same thing, so what he sees as an improvement you viewed as a disaster. My interpretation of this may be wrong, and I haven't attempted to verify either analysis yet.""<p>The ""classic algorithm"" in the above is the classic quicksort as presented by Sedgewick in the thesis, which is slightly different than e.g. the standard Java implementation.

The young guy at the tills was talking about saving up to go and do something-or-other with his University friends. Three years of expensive education and a large debt, and he's landed in a job you can get at 16 if you can nearly count.<p>That said, I was already rapidly concluding that degrees were of questionable value even before the recent fee change (not exactly a tripling of the financial burden because of the very different repayment model and possibility for writeoffs, but still...). I'm still not at all convinced that there is value added to your career prospects by delaying employment by 3 years and accruing a rough year's gross salary debt. I don't doubt it makes the first job easier to get at 21 than it would be by 18 but I've seen no evidence it makes a substantial difference by 25.<p>If you want to go to Univeristy, do it and enjoy it. But for a whole swathe of jobs it's a long way from the meal ticket that it's painted as being.",1297508952

How much larger?  We don't know.",1297508927

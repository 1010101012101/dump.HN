So it will be something like ~99.9% of their tests are done on traditional devices. So we can safely assume that those tests are as reliable as those from other labs.<p>So if they are same as any other legacy industry for 99.9% of the time, then why such a big valuation?<p>They should be valued same as their nearest rival (which I’m sure is a giant compared to Theranos), and if adjusted for the fact that whether Theranos is going to upset them without any secret sauce (and with fewer resources) then the valuation should be near to $0.",1446019170

If you have a serious dynamic javascript page of any complexity,  you have should have a pure js model and your view should be updating off that, using react, mithril, or your own vanilla update function.  Now, not everyone would agree with that, and there may be use cases where it&#x27;s overkill, but in that case I still don&#x27;t buy the argument, as you can just write a short helper function that makes things just as easy as selecting with dataset.<p>I don&#x27;t think a fear of javascript should be driving decisions about markup.

I agree that C++ a horrible mess, but C is not...and it&#x27;s not hard to learn either (in fact, it was the language I learned programming with). I do agree that Scheme is a very nice language, but that doesn&#x27;t make every other language out there bad.<p>Also I don&#x27;t agree with the notion that programming is all about high level algorithms and abstraction. In the end you&#x27;re programming <i>a physical computer</i> and you should be aware of that.

It&#x27;s too overwhelming to have everything there all at once. 100&#x27;s of hours of reading starring at me all at once. Instead, I prefer to use android widgets across my various devices to display random snippets from across various categories which catch my eye over the many times daily I open up my phone. That&#x27;s my discovery and selection method.<p>When it comes to digestion, I will sometimes read it in pocket or some other reading app on my device to optimize that experience, but curiously am compelled to send it back to my computer for social media sharing and/or saving/bookmarking/note-taking.<p>So I guess for my obscure usage pattern, having a type of dashboard or headline section that shows you LESS, perhaps using some type of popularity or personal preference metric would be a much preferable main interface.

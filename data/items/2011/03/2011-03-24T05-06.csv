Also I tend to have bias against any article that claims to be pro-feminism.""<p>Uh, you're saying that, as a male, you haven't seen any sexism, so that means a woman who has experienced sexism is incorrect?<p>Okay, I say you've never been treated unfairly in your life, because I've never seen it happen. Your own experience is insufficient evidence, so don't bother to offer counterarguments.<p>To be clear, your blanket condescending dismissal if someone's own firsthand report of an experience is actually a perfect example of <i>exactly</i> the sort of sexism we're trying to confront.",1300946326

As far as I know, radar post-processing is far more important for trajectory tracking than capturing a single clear image.<p>A Ka band radar, for example, uses centimeter wavelengths, and W band radars are 3mm waves. I've heard that the radars used for tracking objects in orbit can image clearly enough to allow you to estimate the capabilities of an enemy's spy satellite based on the sizes of its antennas and cameras.",1300946287

Now, most companies that receive funding are already revenue positive or have a proven business plan. In the bubble, there was trillions of dollars floating around for IPO after IPO. Now, companies are looking to venture capital for funding, and as a result of Sarbanes Oxley there isn't the avalanche of IPO's that flooded the market back then. Finally, the cost of creating a web based business has come down so much that it's possible to create a revenue positive business with less than a month's salary for a decent developer. No doubt there are a record number of deals being closed at a high valuation, but that's a side effect of the market. Having said that, if the market crashes, I'll happily eat my words but I really think the market has changed.",1300946053

However I'd like to suggest that you've narrowed Mastery quite a bit, The way I see it, proficiency can come with with the ability to guide an alien through the world you understand, but mastery might exist as your very own specific understanding (which when measured against another's mastery might not even be in the same range of comparison ). I might try even argue your point differently,  maybe your proficiency  represents the ability for you to compare to another person's proficiency in a common subject, which allows you to achieve conciseness when discussing the subject.

In the world of science and curiosity, we always ask why something is the way it is. Looking at the requirements for a phenomenon can be a tool in this process, but it's not the only one. In this scientific world, separating and understanding cause and effect is extremely important, it's part of the mission. You call it obsession, and maybe that's a fair charge, but it's really one of the things necessary for constructing scientifically meaningful models.<p>> <i>But to distill all the nuance, joy and sorrow of the human experience into that which can be analyzed, measured, quantified and recorded in a canonical model is a sad existence.</i><p>Please realize that not all of us think this way. For some of us, making stuff up because it somehow resonates with our hearts is the definition of a sad existence. Some of us want to analyze, measure and quantify the universe simply because it is vast and awesome, and revealing the underlying mechanisms of it is extremely rewarding.<p>On a personal note, I believe that religious and supernatural world views cheapen much of the nuance, joy and sorrow of the human experience.

In the meantime, George Hotz wrote a hack to restore the OtherOS feature, and Sony is now trying to nail him with DMCA and other copyright violations.<p>Somewhat complicating the legal situation are Sony's attempts to bring piracy in to the equation: they've argued that removing the ability to run Linux was necessary to prevent piracy, and that Hotz's hack facilitates piracy. Neither claim withstands much scrutiny, as piracy did not become feasible until a Sony employee tweeted their root key, well after they removed the OtherOS feature, and not too long after Sony told the court that Hotz's hack had caused irreparable harm, Sony patched the hole Hotz exploited.<p>It has also been noted that the PS3 is <i>much</i> cheaper than IBM's Cell blades, and that for certain kinds of supercomputing tasks, that more than makes up for the lack of low-latency high-bandwidth interconnects.",1300944250

As an educator, I found a lot of the comments there pretty alarming... and want to ask everyone here to consider a few things when posting about anything related to kids.<p>Kids (and like it or not, that IS what they are) are notoriously dramatic and these kids are definitely experiencing this as a crisis, no matter how they present in their comments.<p>They are also now being border-line, and in some cases overtly cyber bullied by some of their peers online which may be devastating if they don't have great face-to-face support. As adults, we have a responsibility not to add fuel to that fire and remember that if teenagers were predictable and transparent, there wouldn't be so many tragic cases in the news where they hurt themselves and each other.<p>Part of the problem is that teenagers and young adults aren't great at predicting consequences. This isn't opinion - it's science.<p>Especially in males, the part of the brain that is responsible for predicting consequences is not fully developed until the early to middle twenties. This is a double whammy because it leads to their bad decision making, but also to their belief that when something bad happens as a result, that it's literally the end of the world... that there is no way out.<p>There is no disputing that what these boys did was a big deal and that there have to be consequences. But it's also just a symptom of a bigger problem: as a society, we have failed to keep pace with the challenges that are the result of the first generation of digital natives (kids) being raised and educated by a generation of adults who are (at best) digital immigrants.<p>This post is getting way too long so I'm going to finish it on my blog @ thenewtag.com But thanks, criticsquid and nbpoole for posting some of the aftermath.

But &quot;They&quot;, and by they I mean software engineers with a &#x27;ship it&#x27; culture, got stuff to market faster and improved it faster, and called it &#x27;ship and iterate&#x27;.<p>Lots of people were called out as &quot;old fogeys&quot; or &quot;dinosaurs&quot; when they asked to think through some of the ramifications of shipping things. Those folks got trained that such behavior is a quick way to get managed out of an organization.<p>It would be interesting if, as an industry, wave 3 (which like wave 2 before it is a decimal order more engineers than its preceding wave) decided to go back to a more mindful way of developing software. And if so they could remain employed amongst the wave 4 cohort.",1424152771

9060876,comment,9059156,9059567,0,0,craigjb,,,"I agree. How come as software engineers, we like to talk about larger emergent behavior from large groups of simple pieces, but when we talk about governments and nations (large groups of complex pieces) we use analogies to simple systems? For example, the national debt does not operate like a household debt. The cacophony of systems at work in a nation makes it exponentially more nuanced. Some rules are emergent only at the larger scale. Or, international relations. Nation to nation relations don&#x27;t consist of just the heads of state, but whole organizations of people interacting. Again, a large group of complex things (people) interacting probably creates some emergent behavior not visible in small groups. It&#x27;s frustrating to see these systems reduced without any thought.",1424152682
9060875,comment,9058986,9060855,0,0,j2kun,,,"I think you are missing some basic concepts here. There is a single Turing machine (of constant size) which, when given any integer n, outputs A(n). This is the statement that A(n) is computable. One can prove that there is no such Turing machine for the function BB(n) or any function f(n) that bounds BB(n). Such a function would be used to solve the Halting problem as follows: given a TM M and a string x, compute k = f(|M|) and run the TM on x for k steps. If the simulation halts within k steps, output &quot;halt&quot; and otherwise output &quot;loops forever.&quot;<p>Your example of foo/bar(x) is not quite correct. If you fix a program bar, then it is not necessarily impossible to characterize (and hence compute) the set of strings for which bar(x) halts. This is not the statement of the Halting problem, and as far as I know there is no theorem that says such a function &quot;bar&quot; exists.",1424152637

This thread could also be at the top because of the cumulative lack of upvotes, or the weight of downvotes (which have been biased to count more compared to upvotes), in other threads. Or because of the effect of upvotes on individual posts, or its relative length compared to the others. I think it&#x27;s too complex and opaque a system to read so definitively, particularly given the effort put into it by the staff to prevent exactly the sort of gaming you&#x27;re talking about.<p>Although, yes, given those two scenarios specifically, the &#x27;circle of upvoters&#x27; is the more plausible.<p>>If they want to convince people of their point of view, then why can&#x27;t they do it legitimately?<p>That&#x27;s the problem - what you&#x27;re calling out as evidence of illegitimate actions could just as well be legitimate.

Have you taken into account the possibility that people might actually agree with the post?<p>>Doing both is much more effective. Otherwise they control the first posts, they make a sense of a false consensus in their favour, and these things really can influence how people think. Don&#x27;t believe me? Research it yourself.<p>But I have a hard time believing that people are that malleable, or that such a simple tactic could be so effective.

9060838,comment,9058701,9060702,0,0,olympus,,,"There are political differences to be expected, but let me try to explain why the USA is willing to rub elbows with the Saudis and not with Iran.  My credentials are this: I spent 6 months working on strategy in the CENTCOM AOR bitching about every single country in the Persian/Arabian Gulf every single day.  The choice is one of picking the lesser of two evils.  The USA has a great interest in keeping and increasing its geopolitical influence in the Middle East (Israel is not included in this region even though we have to plan for their actions).  The two main regional powers in the Middle East are Saudi Arabia and Iran.  We used to be friendly with both countries back in the 1970s but Iran had a revolution and the Ayatollah didn&#x27;t want anything to do with us, and it remains that way today.  Although the current President of Iran (Rouhani) has mentioned that he would like to improve relations with the USA, he is not the boss regardless of how many people voted for him; the Ayatollah is the Supreme Leader and he still openly calls for the death of Israel and the USA.  So we obviously can&#x27;t be friends with Iran.  That leaves us with Saudi Arabia, and while they also sponsor terrorism, they are all we have left.  We overlook their actions, and in exchange we are allowed to keep a significant military force there, which props up their government and provides them with a pretty big stick when negotiating with the smaller countries in the region (the only other stick they really have is their gargantuan oil production).  So our PATRIOT batteries protect the family of Saud from Iran, and we get to have a little say in their goings on.  It&#x27;s as simple as that.  Just about everybody we deal with is a piece of scum that would like to see the USA brought down a peg, but Saudi Arabia doesn&#x27;t do it openly and they depend on our money and protection, so we get along a little better than them.  Iran openly calls for our destruction.  The last several US presidents, both Republican and Democrat have decided that it&#x27;s better for us to support Saudi Arabia than not have any influence in the Middle East at all.  The only other option is to withdraw our forces (without Saudi Arabia&#x27;s cooperation we would probably lose our basing agreements with all the other countries in the region) and have no say whatsoever and watch as the Middle East goes in a direction that isn&#x27;t beneficial to the USA in the slightest.<p>--And to get back to the topic of the parent post, yeah, this is exactly what the NSA is supposed to do.  It is supposed to do two things: Secure the information of the USA and its citizens, and to undermine the security of everything else.  A lot of US citizens were upset when they found out that the NSA vacuum had gotten their information as well, and rightfully so.  But the NSA is still primarily focused on targeting external entities, and although those entities are well within their rights to complain, don&#x27;t expect the NSA to stop just because someone didn&#x27;t like it.  Regardless of what a federal judge says about collecting on US citizens, no judge will EVER tell the NSA to stop its clandestine activities on foreign networks.",1424151652

In principle, that’s what science is for. “Science is not a body of facts,” says geophysicist Marcia McNutt, who once headed the U.S. Geological Survey and is now editor of Science, the prestigious journal. “Science is a method for deciding whether what we choose to believe has a basis in the laws of nature or not.”&quot; – I do not even know from where to start. I could write a book on the bullshit of this paragraph alone! Science is not a belief. &quot;Facts&quot; are required as evidence. And Science is actually the human translation of the laws of Nature, which could be right or wrong, but is done in a way using arguments constructed within rationality. The way the paragraph is written it is like it is describing a cult!<p>&quot;Science, the prestigious journal&quot;: again, argument of authority.<p>&quot;The students, even those who correctly marked “true,” were slower to answer those questions&quot; – of course they were!!! They were thinking!!! Which seems nowadays is a rarity!!! And that is called conducting!!! The study and the paragraph are being used to lead to what the author of the article wants!!! The link with apes is self-evident because it seems we certainly have returned to that stage!<p>Statistics: really one wants to lie on statistics – there is a planet, on this planet lives two persons, they also have two chickens. One of them eats both of the chickens, but the MEDIUM between them is still one chicken for each person on that planet; nonetheless one of them is still HUNGRY! Nothing against statistics, but we have to be careful in its use. Give any statistics and tell me what you want that it is possible to make it &quot;statistically&quot; happen.<p>&quot;Of course, just because two things happened together doesn’t mean one caused the other, and just because events are clustered doesn’t mean they’re not random. Yet we have trouble digesting randomness; our brains crave pattern and meaning.&quot; – At least some wisdom a time, who&#x27;s to say randomness cannot happen?<p>Oh here we go, &quot;climate-change&quot;! Oh, is this for real? I suppose it is because it is the same bullshit over and over again. I cannot believe I even have to say that: if one has a point to prove, prove it, instead of try to deconstruct what is already a deconstruction. If they are so right and the argument is so strong they just focus on it and not on those saying they cannot sustain their point (which they can&#x27;t).<p>Consensus: again, maybe 200% of scientists or all living and the non-living entities on Earth may also agree that gravity doesn&#x27;t exist, so, since Nature works by &quot;consensus&quot;, we would have a gravity-free day and we could all go happily floating around… so not happening!<p>Now the golden part: &quot;The planet’s surface temperature has risen by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 130 years, and human actions, including the burning of fossil fuels, are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause since the mid-20th century.&quot; Firstly, planet average temperature is a useless statistics; it&#x27;s like saying no one is hungry in my statistical example above. An increase of 1.5ºF = 0.83ºC. That in the MEAN temperature of the Earth, which is to say absolutely nothing! Temperatures on the planet go easily from -50ºC/-58ºF/223K to 50ºC/122ºF/323K or more. Lowest natural temperature ever recorded on the surface of Earth was -89ºC/-128ºF/184K in the Soviet Vostok Station in Antarctica (21 July 1983), the highest being 57ºC/134ºF/330K at Greenland Ranch in the Death Valley in California (10 July 1913).<p>Now the puff, out of the blue part: &quot;and human actions, including the burning of fossil fuels, are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause since the mid-20th century.&quot; Based on what evidence exactly? Because the author has already warned about correlation and clustered events, so he cannot possibly be implying that, right? Moreover, there are plenty more plausible and reasonable explanations for the rise in temperature, the DETECTION of which could be due to human activities, but they are CERTAINLY not the cause on a global scale.
Oh, it gets worse, of course it does! Really? I feel like in elementary school because again instead of advance their climate warming argument they are again trying to discredit those opposing it. More to the point, it does not matter from where it comes from as long as the argument is sound. The laws of Nature are what they are, regardless of who uncovers them. If the argument is not good, one refutes it with another argument not using ad hominen fallacies.<p>Is it just me, or all I could grasp from his conclusions to the survey presented was that those with stronger opinions were exactly those with more knowledge of the subject? Well, obviously, isn&#x27;t it? Oh, yeah, given his last survey example, people should not stop to think (of course, if we ever do, we won&#x27;t swallow so much crap!)<p>Science has no opposites (&quot;antagonist tribes&quot;); it either is or is not.
In Science there is place for DEMONSTRATION and ARGUMENTATION, not BELIEVES. One can of course believes his arguments are correct but cannot hold to them once they are proved wrong, otherwise we scape the realm of science, at which point a discussion in no longer valid. People are free to believe whatever they want, but they are not free to spread unfounded &quot;scientific&quot; arguments, creating a state of &quot;climate terrorism&quot;.<p>&quot;Science appeals to our rational brain, but our beliefs are motivated largely by emotion, and the biggest motivation is remaining tight with our peers.&quot; – Yes, that is exactly it, but it is the other way around. It seems to me that scientists are the ones who do not want to let go of the climate warming bandwagon and all the research money it entails (more than 100 billion dollars have been wasted in the past 20 years and has of course proved nothing!).<p>&quot;Convert&quot;: is that a word to be used in any scientific discussion?!!! I cannot even believe I waste my time!!!<p>What? What? Really the world has gone mad!!! &quot;Do you believe in them or me?&quot; First of all she should be deserted. That is blackmail of the worst kind. I mean climate warming alarmists lack so much arguments that they have to retort to that low level kind of harassment?!!! Do I even need to go on this???<p>&quot;We believe in scientific ideas not because we have truly evaluated all the evidence but because we feel an affinity for the scientific community.&quot; – That is true, until they usurped that affinity (trust!).<p>“There aren&#x27;t really two sides to all these issues. Climate change is happening.” – Absolutely true. Climate changes is not a noun, it is a sentence, climate (subject) changes (verb). It has been changing since Earth was formed and will continue to do so. What would generate cause for worry is if it actually stopped changing, that indeed would be not the norm (not normal).<p>He is using the doubt of measles vaccine to advance his argument on climate warming, and that is a fallacy construction. Just because one was wrong does not means the other is. That is false and emotional leading, something used a lot, of course, since they lack any real arguments.<p>&quot;keep laws governing greenhouse gas emissions from being enacted.&quot; – Rightly so! Those laws won&#x27;t help when changes in nature come. They would only make humanity worse, way, way, worse.<p>&quot;But the claim becomes more likely to be seen as plausible if scientists go beyond their professional expertise and begin advocating specific policies.&quot; – They can barely do science; they don&#x27;t have to advocate policies, they have to prove with reasonable sound arguments and without fallacies their claims.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the way science tells us the truth rather than what we&#x27;d like the truth to be. Scientists can be as dogmatic as anyone else — but their dogma is always wilting in the hot glare of new research. In science it’s not a sin to change your mind when the evidence demands it.&quot; – Too bad they are not following this principle anymore.",1424150445

</code></pre>
At the most radical &quot;ship it&quot; end of the spectrum, you get things like nightlies. It&#x27;s difficult to ship more often; you know when you&#x27;re shipping a little bit too often because your bug database tells you. There&#x27;s a real limit there, where you just can&#x27;t ship it any more often than you already are.<p>At the &quot;art&quot; end of the spectrum, you can spend months refining a product and never really know if you&#x27;re done yet. It&#x27;s completely open-ended. Your bug database will never be empty, there will always be another feature request, and you can easily end up working on version 2.0 when 1.0 never even left testing. You can go forever in the &quot;art&quot; direction.<p>I agree wholeheartedly with the author&#x27;s complaint. I spend most of my time interacting with end-users of software and other engineered systems. People are <i>really</i> frustrated. I keep trying to communicate their frustrations to programmers, but programmers keep blowing it off: &quot;oh, people just hate change, they&#x27;ll get used to it&quot;; &quot;they should update more often, we fixed that bug right after the software was released&quot;.<p>I used to expect there&#x27;d be some kind of backlash at some point, but now I think it&#x27;s worse: a lot of people gave up, they just don&#x27;t expect trouble-free software anymore. It happened just the other day with a bookkeeper who visited a client&#x27;s office while I was there: &quot;this will just take a minute ... oh, Quickbooks updated ... oh, huh, it needs me to re-enter all that information I entered a while back ... I&#x27;ll have to look that up ... oh well.&quot;<p>And it&#x27;s not just the end-users. Programmers expect software to be broken too. They almost relish it, it seems. &quot;That&#x27;s just how it is, fix the bug yourself&quot; or &quot;it works for me&quot; are both common responses that completely dismiss complaints from other programmers.<p>New terminal code could be really awesome. I would love to be able to just drag-and-drop files between terminal windows and have them automagically scp stuff between servers.

9060739,comment,9059156,9060602,0,0,mschuster91,,,"Oh indeed. I did not know about this, thank you very much.<p>I came up with yet another, truly weird plan. Take a 2-platter disk with 500GB (so 250GB per platter), scratch off the label. Modify the firmware so that:<p>a) both platters are encrypted with a hardcoded, generated-at-lowlevel-reformat secret key to delay forensic efforts<p>b) the ATA identify and other ID values point to a 250GB drive (half the original capacity!)<p>c) the bootloader is two-staged, boot0 running on the HDD CPU and boot1 running on the host before the OS bootloader. If e.g. a specific key is pressed during boot, boot1 asks for a password and gives this password to boot0 (e.g. via custom ATA command). boot0 now uses this password to apply a second decryption to platter1 - so there is no TrueCrypt or anything on the &quot;hidden&quot; OS which impacts performance (you can reveal if you&#x27;re using TrueCrypt via a sidechannel attack. Determine the HDD model and compare write speed with a reference value. If you&#x27;re inside spec - no crypto. If you&#x27;re slower - crypto).<p>If no key is pressed, then boot0 boots the bootloader from the unlocked platter2 - the &quot;clear&quot; OS will have no way of seeing the data on platter2 and even if the reported HDD size is compared with the specifications of the (manipulated!) HDD model name as reported to the OS, a malware has no way of knowing that this HDD in fact has a hidden area.",1424149290

I&#x27;m a decent-ish amateur player and if I&#x27;m playing bullet or blitz chess with very low time left on the clock (<10 seconds), and its king pawn vs king ending and I&#x27;m about to convert my pawn, I will almost always choose to under promote to a rook instead of promoting to a queen because I am 100% sure I can mechanically checkmate my opponent without accidentally stalemating (due to a blunder under extreme time pressure) while spending virtually no clock time. I could almost certainly do it with a queen, but it&#x27;s for my own peace of mind that I use a rook instead. Safe and easy victory, but it&#x27;d count as a blunder.",1424149233

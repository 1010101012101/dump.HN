5050588,comment,5038304,5038753,1,0,ZenoArrow,,,"What do you find hard to understand about it? We have limited understanding of how our brains work, that I grant you, but if you're looking at the progression we follow in learning a language (i.e. at a more top level view than at the neuroscience level) then the process is much simpler to understand, it's all to do with recognition, association and conversation. Recognition in both the sense of copying sounds we hear and in recognising facets of the world around us. Association in learning to attribute certain sounds to what we experience. Conversation in learning that by making specific sounds and noticing the reaction of others, we show ourselves that the sounds have purpose in the world around us.<p>As our skill with language develops, so too does our self awareness, which is a whole other can of worms, but the skills we take to start off are simple to summarise, in my opinion.",1358078075

5050544,comment,5049881,5050523,2,0,philwelch,,,"You're missing the point. The point is that you can use plausible sounding justifications to disenfranchise <i>anybody</i>, and once you start that game it'll never be played in good faith. Universal suffrage just works.<p>I also wanted to pry a little into the assumption that people only care about their own well-being and not about anything after their own lifetimes. Actually, people <i>are</i> concerned about the well-being of the children and grandchildren that will survive them. I suspect if you measured it, you'd find that young, childless people are the worst at long-term orientation, partially because they have less reason to be, partially because they haven't had the personal experience of short-term thinking turning around to bite them, and partially because they have less conception of the fullness of time in the first place.<p>But who knows, right? Either one of us might be wrong, but either one of us can make a pretty convincing-sounding argument to disenfranchise arbitrary groups of people, which in effect means that either one of us will end up trying to disenfranchise whatever demographics vote against us. People used to think there were convincing-sounding reasons to disenfranchise women and blacks, or even people who didn't own land. I'd like to think we've moved past that kind of thing.",1358075967

5050542,comment,5049881,5050469,2,0,philwelch,,,"> Why is it that preventing the old from voting is ""bigotry"", whilst preventing the young from voting is merely an act prudence?<p>There are lots of laws that restrict certain rights and privileges to adults only, and for fairly sensible reasons. No one wants to be governed by children. Maybe you want to lower the age of adulthood, and maybe that's possible, but it's something we'd need to do across the board.<p>There's also the troubling idea that you'd be taking the franchise away from people who already have it, rather than simply not extending it to people who do have it.<p>Finally, why would allowing people to participate in the democratic system at age 13 make them take an active interest in politics when allowing people to participate in the democratic system at age 18 does not? The root problem is that young people don't really have vested interests yet. They don't have jobs, or property, or children they're sending to school. When the 26th Amendment was passed, they did have the vested interest of not being drafted, I'll give you that, but that went away. Extending the vote to people who have even fewer vested interests won't have the desired effect.<p>I actually think that lowering the age of majority across the board to around 16 would be a good idea. You'd have to do it sensibly, though. So at age 16, compulsory education is over and you begin two years of national service, but you also immediately get voting and other rights. I can see something like that working.<p>> Net knowledge growth rate usually decreases significantly with age. You'll likely accumulate more knowledge between now and when you're 75, but certainly not three times more[0].<p>I was taking that into account, though.

Her sense of morality was reinforced by her institutional context and is not unique for a prosecutor. She simply failed to recognise when she stepped outside the bounds where her values are recognised - this is not all that dissimilar from Aaron Swartz. As she should have done in his case, if we intend to use her to send a message, there is no need to do so with such zeal.<p>I am highly conflicted about signing this petition. The call for bloodletting should never ring so clearly.",1358075000

MIT grads would be better running MIT than non-MIT grads; MIT grads, however, would be horrible at running small liberal arts colleges.<p>(the idea is probably a MIT undergrad or grad student who then goes to another school or business for some kind of management experience, then eventually returns to MIT, like some of the best administrators; or, a professor who also does admin functions.  Professional administrators have grown in number dramatically faster than enrollment, which is part of why tuition is so high.  We don't need ~50 deans.",1358074855

Not an easy task when you don't have direct knowledge of the facts and the people involved and, to make matters worst, morons add noise to the wire.<p>To say that this is a catastrophe at many levels is an understatement. This should not have happened.<p>While I did not personally know Aaron I have lost at least one good friend to the pressures and stresses of running a business and colliding with the legal system.  I've seen it happen right in front of my eyes.<p>These things are not worth a person's life.<p>Of course, we have a natural ""who done it?"" attitude and now want to find someone to blame for his untimely death. At some level you do have to blame him. No, not for downloading files but rather for making the decision to end his life.  Nobody but him made that decision.  I have suffered enough in business to actually understand how a person can get there, how, before you know it, mental stress and anguish walks you right up to the edge of that precipice. And, once there, only an external force can keep you from jumping off.  In my case this ""non-mascable interrupt"" were my kids. I know they saved my life, even though they had no clue they were doing so. I can't even guess as to why this young and brilliant man did not have someone to pull him away from the edge.<p>And so, as much as one can blame Aaron for taking his own life, it also took external forces to cause him to walk to the edge of the precipice. Sadly, it seems, these forces originated with actions taken by MIT and were amplified by the DOJ. I find myself strangely contemplating the idea that, perhaps, just perhaps, pro-gun extremists who believe the government is out to get us might know something that we don't.  But I digress.<p>Who done it? Well, MIT and DOJ. At least that's how I read it.  I also think JSTOR is at fault, even though they seem to be washing their hands.  Negligence through inaction.<p>Can anything make this right? Well, not really. You can't replace a life.  Yet, the part of me that always wants both sides of an equation to balance has been searching for something that might at least make this horrible event make some sense.<p>I love MIT, but I get the horrible feeling that they fucked up in a big way. Admittedly I have formed this opinion without direct access to the facts. I have to concede at least that to be fair. Still, one idea keeps circling around in my head and I just had to come here and put it out there:<p>JSTOR can no-longer exist. MIT, needs to acquire JSTOR, release all content to the public domain and disband the organization. MIT, shouldn't even have direct control of this data. perhaps it should be handed over to Wikipedia for dissemination (along with the requisite financial support).<p>If it is true that MIT initiated this and they, along with JSTOR, could have made tons of noise to pull back the DOJ, they really need to engage in deep introspection in order to make sure this never happens again. And they need to make JSTOR ancient history. If, despite their substantial financials, this acquisition is beyond their capabilities industry giants such as Apple and Google need to intervene. One of the best ways I can think of honoring Aaron's memory is for this data to be free for anyone, anywhere, to access.<p>RIP",1358074849

I have to make a comment here. Please forgive the intrusion. (I haven't read the entire thread)<p>Corporations are businesses. They provide the best service or product to people at the lowest price.<p>How could you keep a market interested in your product if you were killing people making it? Do you think some kind of secret trade-off where corporations got to kill vast numbers of people secretly in the middle of the night to keep prices low would actually work for _any_ corporation? If you were a CEO, would you gamble the entire corporate stock on it?<p>It's the stuff of Hollywood fantasy, not reality. Business is based on good faith, trustworthy contracts, and the moral and physical support of all concerned. You can't just start whacking people and expect any of that to stay around. That's not reality. Yes -- you could sell a dangerous product. But that's not killing people. It's a different thing entirely.<p>As for ""engineering government"" to work for you, I assume that's the main part of your thread. I'd simply ask that you do a LOT of reading on engineering government to work for people. There have been a lot of people doing a lot of engineering, so we have a lot of history to read and learn about.",1219366539

283344,comment,283323,283323,0,0,gamble,,,"I continue to use eBay, but only for obscure collectibles and art that can't be found anywhere else. They're still irreplaceable in that respect.<p>Still, it's hard to imagine why they think spamming themselves with fixed-price auctions is going to be beneficial. If anything, it hurts them by drowning out traditional auctions. Fraud and flaky sellers are too much of a problem on eBay to use them for any item I can find elsewhere.",1219366093

That's what I meant when I said that you don't <i>have</i> to pay for the features.<p>In any case, the reference-counting used by the safe pointers is probably an order of magnitude less heavy than a garbage collector.

Give them the legal ability to kill people and they will (your example actually supports this, it's when the corporations collude with the government and have a chance of getting away with murder that they do).<p>you seem to be under the mistaken impression that I am pro government.  I'm not.  Bad government is responsible for more death than every other problem that faces humans.  But I'm also a realist, as you say even the most successful of revolutions has only ever slowed government down.  If I had my way the politicians would be dragged from their beds and shot tonight, but the world is not built for people like you and I.  As long as intelligent people are a minority we have to engineer around the problems of government because whether you or I like it government is here to stay.",1219365606

283334,comment,282394,282808,0,0,mdasen,,,"It's unacceptable to the poster because they don't want to have to deal with the realities of computing infrastructure.  They want a turn-key, no-hassle, no-think solution.<p>Which is fine to want.<p>The EBS failure rate is 0.1-0.5% annually.  That's awesome.  At 0.1%, the disk is likely (mean time to failure) to fail in 500 years on average.  At 0.5%, it is likely to fail in 100 years on average.  At either point, I'm more than comfortable.  I can snapshot the drive daily/weekly/monthly and when you combine the snapshots as a backup with the likelyhood of failure in any given year being so low, I can rest easy.<p>Compare that with commercial drives which are likely to fail in a decade give or take. . .  Well, I know where I'd rather have my data.<p>Getting back to the original poster, (s)he wants a system that takes care of the snapshots without intervention.  So, package up EBS along with auto-snapshotting with an SLA saying that you won't loose more than a day of data and you have a business.  You charge a premium because unlike EBS, you're reliable.  All the while, you are just EBS with S3 - something that the individual could do themselves.  EBS is unlikely to ever fail for your clients since I'm guessing no one is going to have a client for 100 years and even if that happens, you just restore one of the daily snapshots.  Nice!  You've lived up to your SLA while getting paid!<p>Think about it, the backups aren't where the cost is.  1000 PUT requests with 4MB chunks means 4GB is backed up for a penny there in terms of the number of requests.  Data transfer from EC2 to S3 is free.  So, those aren't the costs.  As long as you can consolidate the delta backups so you aren't storing a version for every day since inception, I don't see why this service couldn't be offered for 2x the cost of EBS.",1219365272

He echoes Tolle, Zittrain and others who warn (as Zittrain puts it) ""the internet, in many important respects, is a collective hallucination."" Consider how many people today will spend most of their waking life sitting stationary, staring directly at a display. Is that a rational, enlightened way to live given the opportunity cost? I don't know but debating the question as this professor is doing doesn't seem to me horrible or baiting.",1219365198
283332,comment,282394,283108,0,0,rapind,,,"SQS got a lot cheaper, I think around Feb this year. Are you sure you aren't going by the old prices? I find it very affordable now.<p>$0.01 per 10,000 requests\n$0.100 per GB in\n$0.170 per GB out (less with higher volume).<p>I can't remember exactly, but I think it was only a per request cost before of around $0.10 per 1,000 or something.<p>Also the in/out costs don't apply when they're coming from EC2, which would be the case in your scenario I believe. So from EC2 if you're doing an EC2 based distributed system, you're looking at one dollar per million requests (so for processing a message in a distributed system typically one dollar per 500,000 messages pushed then pulled).<p>Pretty cheap by my standards. Much cheaper than it was at initial launch.",1219365052

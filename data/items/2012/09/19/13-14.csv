It's not a time to market issue.<p>> This is a strong statement. It should be backed up.<p>The empirical studies to demonstrate this are extremely difficult to design. However, I think it can be argued for:<p>A central point in countless software engineering and software development books is this exact advice (""avoid coupling"") along with attempts at demonstrating patterns, idioms, approaches for how not to couple. Many people that give this message are highly respectable practitioners in our industry, Rich Hickey being one of them. In all of the books and messages that I've read/watched, never once have I seen the messenger say ""Here's how not to couple, but note that this takes longer so pick your poison."" No -- not one mentions a trade-off. The focus is entirely on teaching you a way to design systems.<p>When I design and code systems, I now instinctively decouple. It would take work for me and more time to couple things together because it goes against my learned instincts.<p>It takes experience and explicit willingness to develop this ability. But it is the most important skill to learn. It has the hugest impact on the agility and potential of your software. (By the way, it doesn't take years for coupling decisions to have impact, the problems of coupling start to cripple you pretty quickly.)<p>To your point about junior engineers... In other industries, we don't hand over the keys to such momentous decisions to entry-level people. Junior architects don't build buildings. Why do we do this in software?",1348063184

Even when I asked specifically for an Android phone, the salesperson wanted me to consider a Lumia. After some friendly interrogation, she admitted the commission for selling a Lumia was about twice as much as the commission she would get for selling my the Android device, and part of it would be paid directly by Nokia through some incentive program.<p>Microsoft is spending a ton of money on it and a lot is channelled directly through Nokia.",1348063117

4543528,comment,4543326,4543326,7,0,spacemanaki,,,"Most of the reasons and benefits apply to other papers of course, not just those authored by McCarthy.<p>I used to collect PDFs of CS papers to read, and try to read them while sitting at my laptop, but I never actually finished reading a single one of them. I would start them, get slightly distracted or bored, and switch away to something else, whether HN, or programming, or almost anything else on the computer.<p>If you have similar tendencies, and you're going to try reading some papers, may I suggest an approach which may be obvious to some but was not to me, that I recently adopted to great success: print them out and read them away from the computer.<p>For me, this was a bit counter to how I normally work. I usually loathe having hard copies of anything that I'm not legally required to. I would much rather have a PDF somewhere on a hard drive than keep documents in folders and filing cabinets. I expect many HN readers are similar.<p>However, I've found that printing out papers and reading them somewhere away from the computer is just so much more productive. For me, it's really almost infinitely so, since I never finished a single paper while reading the PDF in Preview.app but have finished many in the past couple of months that I printed out. Somehow, sitting somewhere with a hard copy both allows me more focus, and gives me more pleasure. With a PDF, it's often a bit hard to gauge how much there is left to read, while if you have a stack of paper in a binder clip, it's obvious in a tactile way. I bet it's also better for my eyes, or at least it feels that way.<p>This is not a new or innovative strategy, but I thought I'd share my experience since it might not be the first choice for many programmers.<p>One other tip is to avoid printing papers out of at home, if you don't have a fast laser printer but instead some sluggish old inkjet as I do. Print them out at a print shop, which is faster and likely even cheaper (Fedex/kinkos in NYC charges 12c/page B&W.",1348063054

Compared with classic rotary phones, the iPhone is anything but simple - of course, for the provided functionality, the iPhone has a lot of features packed in a tight package that has a pretty simple interface by today's standards. But regarding parents, on the contrary, I've watched my mom struggle with an iPhone, before she got back to an older Nokia model, with a simple key pad and no extra functionality other than SMS.<p>- because of the specs, the iPhone consumes a lot of battery, even by using it only for your basic needs - it's sure nice to have a phone with a battery that lasts for 7 days of normal usage.<p>- mobile phones are designed to be usable for 2 years, after which the battery and the hardware start falling apart.<p>Also, the T9 dictionary was really awkward. I don't think anybody was suggesting that Nokia should return to their older models.

4543476,comment,4543163,4543163,3,0,lawdawg,,,"I think Nokia seriously underestimated the ""Instagram/Zynga"" factor when they decided to go with Windows Phone.  The average consumer does a minimal amount of research before buying a phone, and typically buy whatever the sales representative recommends (unless they are looking for a specific model, like the iPhone or SGS3).  But on top of that, consumers will still ask questions like:<p>1.  Oh my friend uses this app called ""Instagram"", does Windows Phone have ""Instagram""?<p>2.  I want to play ""Words with Friends"" with my friends, can I do that on Windows Phone?<p>If the sales representative is honest (I mean he has to be or will get an instant return), the consumer is just going to pick up an equally cheap or cheaper Android phone.<p>The 920 does not solve this problem despite having pretty sweet hardware.  Not only that, its a huge phone like the SGS3, but quite heavy, which will turn off a lot of consumers who want big screens, but light devices (you don't see Apple making bigger phones that are <i>heavier</i>).  Even if the camera is the best on the market (and to be honest, I don't think it will be noticeably better than the iPhone5 and upcoming Android phones), without useful apps for sharing those photos, people won't be drawn to the platform.<p>Finally, things like wireless charging and using the phone with gloves on are not major selling points, just like NFC has never been a major selling point.",1348062234

Having spent significant time with Nokia devices (including Maemo/Meego), I completely agree with him. A few years back Android itself was second choice for most mobile developers, and it was almost impossible for Nokia to get them to write apps. Also, Android picked up because of Google; if Samsung made Android it would have gone the Bada way.<p>WP8 is the first OS that gives Nokia a fighting chance against iOS/Android devices.<p>- I have only seen positive reviews of this OS.<p>- It is do or die for MS as well, expect massive ad spend this season.<p>- Shared kernel with Windows. Attractive to millions of Windows developers. (Windows isn't cool anymore; but there are way, way more developers on Windows than any other platform.)<p>- If resource constrained WP7 is anything to go by, WP8 will be smoother than any android phone in the market.<p>This is Elop's first, last and only chance.

However, I think smartphones are where the profit is. Once companies have seen the huge profits Apple have made, they want a piece of that pie. And frankly, who can blame them?<p>My wife just got a new phone. She wanted a basic phone as she likes texting on a standard phone keypad, and wanted an OK camera on it. She couldn't get a basic phone that did that, so ended up with a low end HTC Android (of the same spec as my mid-high end HTC from last year.) It could be the phone networks just don't want to stock basic phones as they don't make enough money off the contracts for them, they want to sell all the extras. On the flip side, last time I looked at basic phones they all seemed very poorly made and with awful interfaces, which is why I went to a smartphone a few years ago.<p>There are simple, large print phones targeted for older folk, they mainly seem to be advertised in the little pull-out magazines that come inside TV listing mags and similar in the UK, and during advert breaks on daytime TV.",1348059858

The days of a one-size-fits-all language are over. Your best bet is to learn the principles and then the syntax differences just aren't that troublesome. The problem is that when you are new to programming, you learn only a small subset of those principles, and  then are stumped when it is time to pick up a new language because it may rely on new concepts.<p>In education, Scheme once occupied the role of being the language in which you could learn and investigate a broad range of principles of computation. However, the perceived need for vocational training seems to have pushed Scheme out of the curriculum.<p>Today, Haskell is the best choice for this role.",1348059724

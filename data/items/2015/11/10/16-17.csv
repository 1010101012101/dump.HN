10540500,comment,10538037,10538798,0,0,mindslight,,,"> <i>Chinese factories will manufacture things with as much quality as you want ... Pretty much all of electronics you use, including the most high-end devices, was made in China.</i><p>Agreed.<p>> <i>Western &quot;Chinese = crap&quot; stereotype seems to be because of Western companies, which pay for low-quality manufacturing.</i><p>Eh? If I go on eBay/Aliexpress and order some consumer good, the only worthwhile thing I&#x27;m going to receive is the amazement at seeing exactly how far they skimped. I doubt choosing a more expensive listing would yield a better result. Nevermind the many stories I&#x27;ve heard of Chinese manufacturing autonomously substituting different part numbers on a BOM, causing a run to be reworked or scrapped.<p>This indicates the culture of &quot;good-enough&quot; cheapness belongs to China itself. Yes, it is possible to pay more (meaning supervise more) for quality production in China - if it weren&#x27;t, everything wouldn&#x27;t be made there. But this seems like getting quality in <i>spite</i> of Chinese customs.",1447174785

It took a day for me to change back, but I sounded pretty odd given the normal ND / MN accent.  It probably didn&#x27;t help that my normal speech pattern back then threw a couple of Dakota words in the mix.

The local increases in rent around here have been astounding over the past 2 years and most of my friends who have had a life event causing them to have to change apartments have been completely priced out and forced to go to the Valley. I attribute much of this to AirBnB, having known a few people here that operate business models much like what is described in the article. We have the most expensive hotel rates in the state and vacation rentals are extracting a lot of profit from the market because of it.<p>I know a girl who rented three 1-bedroom apartments around Santa Monica. She would live in whichever of the three was fetching the least interest on AirBnB that month and put the other two up. Those two units were occupied about 10-15 days a month. After all expenses she netted about $1000 cash and free rent for herself every month. In return there were two more units taken off the market and the price of actual residential units driven up ridiculously.<p>L.A. Mayor Garcetti came to speak at our office last week and he said that there is one housing unit west of the 405 (demarcation of west L.A.) for every 4 jobs west of the 405. Turning so many housing units into short term rentals is making this far worse. I support Santa Monica&#x27;s law even if it means that I cannot rent my apartment out while I am traveling this December. I don&#x27;t want to live somewhere that only techies can afford.",1447174678

My algorithm probably converges to the global minimum.  Why wouldn&#x27;t it?)<p>When garbage-collected languages are used, programs spend 99% of their time allocating and deallocating small quantities of memory in tightly nested inner loops (16 of them, no less).  &quot;Inlining&quot; means putting comments inside of the code instead of above it (if there even are any comments).  &quot;Cache locality&quot; has something to do with GPS systems.  &quot;Hashing&quot;, &quot;recursion&quot;, and &quot;quicksort&quot; are the names of recently-announced smartphones.  And doesn&#x27;t &quot;SIMD&quot; stand for the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders?<p>/rant<p>It&#x27;s a mess.  Granted, there are researchers who write very high quality code, but they are few and far between.  I think the main problem is that a lot of students/professors who get involved in computational research never had a good CS background.  Perhaps they had one &quot;Computing for Engineers&quot; class that taught Matlab or Python, but that isn&#x27;t nearly sufficient for research-quality code.  While I had the advantage of taking up programming as a hobby during childhood, most graduate students have never programmed before in their life.  They&#x27;re expected to learn something like C++ in a week (that&#x27;s not a hypothetical example).<p>Many researchers are afraid to publish their code alongside their paper because they <i>know</i> the code is low-quality.  And that awareness causes a lot of insecurities.  If someone finds a bug in their 2-3 year research project, then their entire conclusion might be invalidated.  But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the biggest worry (most scientists ultimately want to know the truth about their subject of study).  I think the biggest fear is of losing prestige, losing a chance for tenure, or having funding revoked.<p>To fix this problem, there is a <i>crucial</i> and <i>urgent</i> need for the academic community to reduce the penalty associated with making honest mistakes.<p>Mistakes are simply part of the research process.  Humans are fallible — <i>everyone</i> is going to mess up at some point.  And instead of propagating this academic &quot;chilling effect&quot;, it would be much better for the whole scientific community if everyone quit worrying about messing up and instead published their code in a highly visible location, subjecting it to the highly critical (yet extremely beneficial) scrutiny that it deserves.",1447174325

Many of them just congregate into their own groups, and rarely speak English except for when they have to. Then, they wonder why they get such low reviews when they give a lecture!<p>In a way, this is highly pragmatic of them. Most of them do not want to stay in the United States after they graduate, so they have no interest in the extra effort that it takes to learn an American accent.  The extra time it would take actually pulls them away from their research, and is seen as a distraction. Unfortunately, those who do want to stay either don&#x27;t know how to, can&#x27;t, or won&#x27;t practice a better American accent, and so are extremely difficult to understand, even when you are familiar with the subject matter that they are talking about.<p>I have met only I have a dozen or so foreign students that I did not were from another country until they told me so.

It looks like this:<p>---\ntitle: &#x27;The Title of an Entry Here&#x27;\ndate: 2015-04-15\ncategory: &#x27;News&#x27;\nexcerpt: &#x27;A short excerpt here&#x27;\nlayout: default\nfoo: &#x27;Bar&#x27;\n---\nSome markdown content here, which is likely the longest part. This can be quite long, in fact.<p>HTML OUT<p>Now, imagine a folder of these markdown files on your hard drive. We&#x27;ll call this your project. The code of our static site generator could say &quot;for each markdown file in folder x, move it to folder y.&quot; But that&#x27;s not too exciting.<p>Let&#x27;s say, instead of just moving that file, the generator reads all the files in a certain directory or directories and creates an &quot;object&quot; with them: &quot;For each file in folder x, list its contents in our object.&quot; That object is just a stored list of all the files, including their file names, any meta-data specified in the front matter, and their content.<p>That object might look something like this (in Ruby, as output from Jeyll):<p><i></i>\{&quot;layout&quot;=>&quot;default&quot;, &quot;title&quot;=>&quot;The Title of an Entry Here&quot;, &quot;category&quot;=>&quot;News&quot;, &quot;excerpt&quot;=>&quot;A short excerpt here&quot;, &quot;published&quot;=>true, &quot;url&quot;=>&quot;/news/2015/04/14/post-title-here/&quot;, &quot;dir&quot;=>&quot;/news/2015/04/14&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=>2015-04-14 00:00:00 -0400, &quot;id&quot;=>&quot;/news/2015/04/14/post-title-here&quot;, &quot;categories&quot;=>\[&quot;news&quot;], &quot;next&quot;=>, &quot;previous&quot;=>, &quot;tags&quot;=>\[], &quot;path&quot;=>&quot;\_posts/2015-04-14-post-title-here.md&quot;, &quot;content&quot;=>&quot;Some markdown content here, which is likely the longest part. This can be quite long, in fact.&quot;, &quot;section&quot;=>&quot;post&quot;}<i></i><p>You can tell already that in creating the object the static site  generator has extrapolated some information, like a &quot;url&quot; created from our specified date and category: &quot;For each file in folder x, write to our object and combine its category, date and file name to create a url in a format like &#x27;/category/yyyy-mm-dd/original-base-filename.html&#x27;.&quot;<p>Once we&#x27;ve generated our object, the generator can do quite a bit with it. We can create an HTML page with the url as created above, and that file could be manipulated further using some of the meta-data we&#x27;ve specified.<p>More than likely, we don&#x27;t want to display content written in Markdown, so the generator will convert our markdown into HTML before outputting it to our new file: &quot;for each item in the object, convert the value of &#x27;content&#x27; from markdown to HTML.&quot;<p>And, of course, we don&#x27;t want to just display plain text, we want to style the page. We&#x27;ve likely created a set of templates in our project and specified in our content file which template to use for each file.<p>In our templates we lay out our HTML and also some tags that specify which parts of our file (the content or some piece of metadata) to display: &quot;For each item in our object, apply its content to the template specified as &#x27;layout&#x27; as we output it as HTML.&quot;<p>Each template may output other content too. A template might call: &quot;for each item in our object, loop through the ones that have a &#x27;category&#x27; equal to &#x27;news&#x27; and display the title.&quot;<p>So, along the way to just creating the HTML file, the generator will read the templates and output HTML in the format we&#x27;ve dictated. In the end, we have a new folder with our fully formed HTML files.<p>Asset files, like CSS and javascript are just moved into the new folder, so that in the end, that folder contains our fully formed website, which can then be moved to a web server.<p>So a static site generator converts one set of files into another using templates for instructions on how to output them in their final form.<p>If any of the formatting looks bad here, this is from my site &quot;Static is the New Dyanamic&quot; about static site generators: <a href=""http://www.thenewdynamic.org/articles/how-do-static-site-generators-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thenewdynamic.org/articles/how-do-static-site-gen...</a>",1447174268

They made everything about my tracking difficult: from logging foods, to counting net carbs, to varying my caloric targets per day.<p>So I built Joy. The key feature is its flexibility. Joy allows you to track any diet under the sun. This includes diet groups such as:<p>1. Keto-ers: it automatically calculates net carbs for all foods, and lets you set targets for this metric.<p>2. Intermittent fasters: you can set different caloric and macro goals depending on the day of the week. You can switch individual days easily.<p>3. Cooks: creating recipes is very easy. Moreover, modifying or experimenting with recipes as one-offs - while <i>still</i> tracking them - is supported. I&#x27;ve often cooked the same pasta only changing one ingredient. Or the proportions.<p>4. Bulkers: athletes and people from all walks of life often want to <i>gain</i> weight - in a controlled manner. Most diet trackers assume you want to lose weight and build all UX towards that goal. Not Joy. Calculating what you need to gain weight is even built into the app.<p>I also identified and developed features that would prove useful:<p>1. No obnoxious ads slowing down the experience. Instead, charge money for a service that interested people use every day. After announcing these changes, feedback was largely positive.<p>2. Nutritional data accuracy: I source from a few (commercial) providers, but they&#x27;re all professionally curated. The actual search algorithm needs work, but once you land on an item, its data is vastly more accurate than many of the user-contributed foods of the competition. Once I figure out a sustainable approach for user-contributed foods - perhaps with a voting system à la Stack Overflow - I will add this feature.<p>3. Speed: the entire UX is built around being able to quickly log your food. The harder and longer this takes, the more likely you are to deviate from your diet plans. Joy does require some familiarization, but once you get the hang of it, adding foods is incredibly quick. You can copy, cut, expand, contract, and distribute meals in seconds. Repetition soon becomes second nature.<p>4. Sharing: every individual piece of content should be shareable, not an all or nothing approach like the alternatives. For example, here is one of my favorite recipes, no login needed: <a href=""https://www.joyapp.com/share/VMsGfhgdzvErmdqvxi8wSf/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.joyapp.com/share/VMsGfhgdzvErmdqvxi8wSf/</a><p>It&#x27;s a web app, as well as an Android and iOS cordova app, see here:<p>1. <a href=""https://www.joyapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.joyapp.com</a><p>2. <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joyapp.android"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joyapp.and...</a><p>3. <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/joy-health-tracker/id955172784?ls=1&mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/joy-health-tracker/id9551727...</a><p>I&#x27;ll be around for questions all day.

My short form take is that regardless of its potential in theory if implemented nicely, in practice SELinux as deployed has consistently prioritized mathematical perfection (and yelling at people) over practical usability in the field. The real result of this has been less security than would have been achieved with a less perfect but more usable system because in the field SELinux does not degrade gracefully and so many people turn it off entirely. Some number of systems are quite secure (assuming no leaks in SELinux itself); many other systems are not secure at all. This is a bad outcome (unless you decide that only people who are dedicated enough to use SELinux really matter and everyone else is &#x27;unprofessional&#x27; or the like), and I don&#x27;t like it.

While there is no such thing as an unbeatable system, there is definitely people higher up aware of the possibility and actively preventing any major paradigm shifts in politics.

A megajournal will typically review for scientific soundness only. If the methodology is sound then the paper should be accepted regardless of whether it breaks new ground in the field or is seen as important.<p>This is not the same kind of peer review that you will find when submitting to Nature, where they are trying to curate for importance in addition to vet for soundness. I won&#x27;t argue one way or the other about whether one type of peer review is better than the other, there are arguments to be made on all sides. But they are not the same, and they do not cost the same amount.<p>Methodological peer review is cheaper. That&#x27;s why the megajournals like PLOS One, et al do it that way (well, it&#x27;s one of the reasons, the other main one being a philosophical reason). You could not run the big OA operations at their price points with traditional peer review. Their revenue is purely driven by acceptance volume, and so therefore anything that slows down peer review or rejects too many papers has a serious material impact on revenue. It&#x27;s a balancing act between ensuring you don&#x27;t accept quack science accidentally but don&#x27;t reject too much than you have to.",1447173005

It&#x27;s so alien to ordinary human experience that asking someone with no experience in it to manage it is like asking a blind person to direct a silent film. Actually the latter is far more likely to be successful. I can&#x27;t actually think of an analogy right now that suitably captures just how inept a non-developer is at managing developers.<p>From the link:<p>&quot;Members of the &quot;apparat&quot; were frequently transferred between different areas of responsibility, usually with little or no actual training for their new areas of responsibility. Thus, the term apparatchik, or &quot;agent of the apparatus&quot; was usually the best possible description of the person&#x27;s profession and occupation.&quot;<p>&quot;It is often considered a derogatory term, with negative connotations in terms of the quality, competence, and attitude of a person thus described.&quot;",1447172727

PARC was developing from mostly a clean slate and got to define how computing would become for the average user. (And let&#x27;s face it, not all of what came out of PARC was good. The windowing desktop has its flaws).<p>Nowadays everyone already has an electronic device and there are thousands of other companies working on related research. It&#x27;s unlikely, in this context, that the VPRI can have such a massive impact - particularly when they&#x27;ve decided to use tools (ie, Smalltalk) that the rest of the computing industry rejected decades ago (whether for the right reasons or not, the superstition is already in place, and reversing that attitude isn&#x27;t going to happen quickly).<p>I&#x27;m a fan of some of the work VPRI has done, especially Gezira, but it&#x27;s only a small part of a much bigger picture, and there&#x27;s no silver bullet in computing. I&#x27;ve seen work from outside of the VPRI which is likely to have a larger impact on the state of software development, and hardware developments which seem impossible to succeed given the current state of software. It will be a nice fairytale in 30 years if we can point at one company for creating what has become, but it ignores the tens of thousands of research papers that contributed to the current state of computing, and the state which it will become.<p>What&#x27;s more fascinating about the VPRI isn&#x27;t the results, but the methods. Start by throwing away superstition about how computing is currently done and lets look at other ways we could do it, rooted in well-understood theory.

So far there are only 3 notable corporate pledges - 2 x $6000 and 1 x $2000. Another $8200 came from individual non-corporate donors, contrary to the central idea of the campaign.<p>With 50 days to go, I am at a loss where did things go wrong. My original thinking:<p>- By most conservative estimate (1700h/year, a far cry from reality) I am essentially asking for $70/h<p>- The main library I provide is robust, developed in a very conservative no-hype fashion. Its feature set has no alternatives within its ecosystem, with some features being unique across any similar projects in any language.<p>- I, as an individual developer, have strong and positive name recognition within the ecosystem<p>- I know of (and contacted) at least 34 companies having built massive products on top of this library.<p>Clearly this is not coming together as I expected. I have several courses of action:<p>- Double down on publicity, despite the already critical mass of engineers across the ecosystem expressing all kinds of thumbs up, goading higher-ups into pledging. The campaign risks turning into a true grass-roots crowdfund obscuring the main point: Too much is at stake business-wise if a sudden drop of quality occurs, while the un-fun grueling work continues solely as &quot;civic duty&quot;.<p>- Exert more pressure on my corporate contacts: This is... difficult. Publishing the text and doing the initial round of &quot;passing the hat&quot; was bad enough. I fear a second time will &quot;overdo it&quot;.<p>- Wait: perhaps various contacts did not have sufficient time to get approvals.

The more customers they satisfy, the more customers they can hope to win.<p>This freedom means that these companies can follow the common trajectory of releasing a simple realization of their product which is then honed by iteration. But companies contracted to produce government and corporate systems rarely have this freedom in my experience, but for different reasons.<p>In the case of government systems it is politically (and often morally) unacceptable to exclude specific classes of end users from a system; the requirement to make a system available to nearly 100% of possible users while at the same time catering for the labyrinthine complexities of local and national government is simply very difficult.<p>In corporate environments, there is a similar pressure to meet 100% of customer needs, but in this case the users are often staff and though the problem is similar at a technical level, the source of the pressure is different:<p>Google is a large corporation, and when it releases a product like Gmail, users can choose to use it, or not: they can&#x27;t singly demand changes, so Google has the power to stand up to users and, in short, be a good custodian of the user experience.<p>When developing software for corporate customers, this relationship is inverted, and very often, every wrinkle in every  corporate business process is expected to be modelled in the software. As a contractor, you know you could produce better software for the corporation, <i>if</i> they were willing to adapt some of their processes in the same way customer adapt their behaviour to using Gmail, but they have the power.<p>The result is the same in both cases: excess complexity.",1447171269

In the end, very few people took much vacation.<p>While I have no problem with the general premise of that policy, I would rather have had an additional stipulation that all employees are required^ to take, say, 3 weeks of vacation annually (or, pick a number). That way, it was expected you would be out of the office for a portion of time.<p>^ I guess you can't force people to do that, but it would have made things so much less confusing or difficult to me if I could point to such a ""rule.""<p>[Edit: I realize some of this problem probably rested on the shoulders of management, but that wouldn't have solved all the issues of the policy.]",1351789132

I'm an engineer in the software team, developing mostly embedded design and instrumentation tools for FPGAs.<p>We are looking for software developers experienced or with a strong desire to learn about Computer Architecture, FPGA design, Digital Logic, Embedded Systems, and more, while at the same time developing engineering design tools in high level languages.
To give you an idea of what we do, these are some of the projects that involved me at Altera:<p><pre><code>  * Designed and implemented a high performance on-chip network that's used
    in thousands of routers, base stations, and switches around the world.
  * Created a hardware/software instrumentation framework in a mix of Java, C++, C, 
    and Verilog. This is the foundation for all the debuggers at Altera.
  * Modified the GCC toolchain to add support for Altera's processors, like our
    NiosII soft processor.
  * Implemented a GDB Server from scratch in Java.
  * Defined and implemented the pieces of an ARM CoreSight debug subsystem.
  * Implemented infrastructure used in a C-to-Gates compiler.
  * Spent hours hacking away with the tools and many of the available
    development boards.

And I've realized, that HackerNews is on of the best places, to tell a startup idea. Also I'd like to say sorry for my bad English, hope you will understand my idea. So let's start.<p>The project name is Dressable or http://en.dressable.me/. The main idea is to simplify shopping process and try to solve some problems, that appear when 
you are at a shop and would like to buy something. Two main causes are: you see something and you are sure, that you want to buy exactly this product,
and exactly today. Meanwhile, it's very rare situation when people are so sure about something. Usually, they are looking for some ideas how to make a choice.
To solve this problem you can do shopping with your close friend, or with a boyfriend/girlfriend, or try to ask people in shop, or try to bring some fashion expert with you, even ask your parent for some certain age time frames. Some people can try to send MMS, or to call to someone and try to describe, what they are interested to buy.<p>So the main idea, from a customer's point of view, is to provide fast and reliable connections with people who influence you on fashion field. From technology point, it will be a client application, where you will be able to take a picture and discuss with people who influence you, in real-time. And solid back-end part with lots of data mining and information retrieval.<p>If you are interested, I can describe additional points of making money and some implementation points, or my background and experience in related fields
and other questions, that you will ask.<p>I got good feedback from consumers, who is interested in our project and people with solid entrepreneurial background. Also I know some people from the fashion area.<p>And now I'm looking for some strong UI/UX iOS guys, who can help me to build this.<p>Best regards,

The driver of your rate needs to be based upon the value of your services.  Are you going to enable a company to make $500,000 more next year?  Then if they want to pay you $50/hr because it's 'market rate', you need to tell them to kiss your ass.<p>The presumption is that everyone is already doing this, and that everyone has a reasonably correct understanding of what the actual value of their work is.  This is a false presumption, but it is a presumption which is absolutely necessary for any defense of capitalism.  Knowledge of value has to be spread equally or all of the promises of capitalism fall apart.  Anyhow, if everyone DID know what the value of their work was and set their prices by that, the idea is that a market rate would establish itself, which certainly would happen.  What we've got today however is employers telling everyone to set their rates by the 'market rate' and ignore any other drivers... which makes it very easy to drive down the price over time.

Apple tried to damage Samsung by taking victory in advance. When they then lose, it is only natural they face consequences, otherwise they would have no incentive not to the same again.<p>They chose to take the proposed wording, chop it into two pieces, and inject their own paragraphs that are clearly intended to play up Apple and to downplay and dilute the purpose of the message and create doubt about whether or not there was copying by referring to other judgements, and on top that they are misrepresenting the court cases they mention:<p>The German court did not find that Samsung had carried out any infringing copying of their design. The US jury did <i>NOT</i> find the Samsung Galaxy Tab infringing. Apple's comment is technically correct, but they are on purpose clearly failing to mention that the judgement is mostly irrelevant to the UK case as it deals mainly with other products than the UK case (which only deals with the Galaxy Tab), and in the one instance where it <i>is</i> relevant, Samsung prevailed.<p>Apple is free to question the judgement, but doing so by diluting the effect of the very message the judges ordered them to put in place is at best a stupid mistake, at worst wilful attempt at doing an endrun around the court. The only reason they got away with this as lightly as they did is because the judges can't prove it wasn't someone just being stupid.

4728321,comment,4726599,4727950,4,0,price,,,"Hi, patch author here. Two of the falcon patches address the same two issues as my patch series. One caches the expanded $LOAD_PATH (which is expensive to compute mainly because it involves allocating a lot, typically hundreds of KB, and the Ruby GC isn't very efficient), which my patch #4 does. Another speeds up searching the $LOADED_FEATURES array -- his patch keeps it sorted, while my #3 leaves the array unchanged but maintains a hash table pointing into it.<p>The main difference between the patches is how we maintain the needed invariants, as both $LOAD_PATH and $LOADED_FEATURES are visible to Ruby code and actually mutable from Ruby code. The falcon patches put singleton methods on each of those arrays, wrapping the methods that mutate arrays in order to make them maintain the invariant. This is a very general approach that could implement any desired behavior, but it is relatively complex in the number of cases it has to explicitly handle.<p>My patches instead take advantage of a feature of the Array implementation to keep a snapshot of each of $LOAD_PATH and $LOADED_FEATURES, and on each 'require' call detect whether they've been mutated. If they have, we rebuild our invariants. This has an advantage in simplicity -- the Array implementation already must track when an Array is mutated, and we just piggyback on that.  It can cost more time, but never much more than the status quo (where we must effectively rebuild all the state on every 'require' call), and in normal usage people rarely mutate $LOADED_FEATURES at all and mutate $LOAD_PATH in only one or a handful of bursts, rather than alternating mutation, require, mutation, require many times.  So in practice it should be almost as fast as if we never had to rebuild.<p>NB that funny_falcon himself, aka Yura Sokolov, is participating in the bug thread, so you can read his thoughts there.",1351787259

The failure to comply with a judge's legally issued order without specifically going to the court and asking for a stay pending an appal, is considered extremely serious exactly because the rule of law requires someone to be the arbiter, and if one party was able to get away with just ignoring what the judge orders them to, then the court has no ability to carry out it's duties.",1351785982

REMOTE<p>i.TV is making Nintendo TVii, the TV experience that launches with the WiiU on November 18th, and we want your help to make it awesome.<p>We are looking for several engineers and one devops engineer to help us revolutionize television. We create applications for tablets, phones, and laptops that work seamlessly with your home system to suggest content to watch, control your TV, and deliver engaging complimentary experiences and extra content during the show.<p>We currently have the top TV app in the app store. We power Huffington Post TV and social TV experiences for EW.com.<p>But NintendoTVii is 10x as cool as that. It is all about what you do while you're watching TV. It will be preinstalled on the WiiU this fall, and we will be in tens of millions of homes before the end of 2013.<p>Our team and culture are what set us apart
1. Currently 7 really smart engineers.
2. Lots of autonomy, minimal red tape. 
3. We work in small teams of 2-4 engineers, a designer and a product person who are given a high-level assignment. They are small enough to avoid process/organizational overload and meetings. 
4. Meetings, seriously, the only ones we have are Friday lunch and casual ones over the foosball table. 
5. Focus on learning! Tell us about the cool stuff you use or invent and we'll use it. Go to conferences on the company dime.
6. 20% time - every Wednesday we have ""Developer day"" where you pick what you think is important and do it. 
7. Personal responsibility - you take vacation whenever you want, choose your own hours, choose your own equipment.<p>We have great benefits
1. Sweet equipment. We just bought everyone retina macbook pros. 
2. Fully stocked fridge and kitchen with drinks, snacks and lunches. 
3. 100% health and dental
4. Above-market salary that we reset as often as necessary
5. Fun downtown Provo location and building<p>Equity opportunity
20% of the post-investor equity goes to the employee stock plan. Our hardware partner recently advanced us several million against advertising revenue this fall, and we are on track to blow past that before the end of the year. We were last valued at 20 million, and expect to be valued at 50 million during 2013.<p>Technology
We use node.js for most of our backend services. We use MongoDB as our database. We create rich clients with JS/HTML, iOS and Android. We expect you to be proficient in at least one of these technologies, and to be able to learn more. We're looking for great devs over a specific skillset.<p>For the DevOps position, we're looking for someone who can focus on scaling, removing deploy friction, uptime and security, but we want someone who is constantly inventing and automating to solve the problem, rather than resorting to manual labor.<p>Some cool problems we are working on:
1. There are 800,000 unique channel lineups with up to 1000 channels each, with millions of unique events. How can you massage the programming information to make TV guide APIs fast?
2. We create software that watches TV to extract thumbnails every second, and analyze the caption and audio data. How can we make this faster and more scalable?
3. How can we create really compelling web applications on custom hardware?
4. How do you implement really custom, unique but simple designs and keep it maintainable?
5. How do we get a mobile device to control a TV?
6. How can we show users the content they will care about most?
7. How can we use data about sports or TV programs to create engaging visualizations?
8. How can we help users interact with each other while watching tv?<p>Email jamison@i.tv for more info. Visit <a href=""http://i.tv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.tv</a> to see the promo stuff.",1351785832

But the indictment is damning; the DOJ has MegaUpload's emails and lays the case out in Kim & Co's own words. For instance:<p><i>On or about April 23, 2009, DOTCOM sent an e-mail message to VANDER KOLK, ORTMANN, and BENCKO in which he complained about the deletion of URL links in response to infringement notices from the copyright holders. In the message, DOTCOMstated that I told you many times not to delete links that are reported in batches of thousands from insignificant sources. I would say that those infringement reports from MEXICO of 14,000 links would fall into that category. And the fact that we lost significant revenue because of it justifies my reaction.</i><p>And:<p>* When an outsider complained that MegaVideo's hosting of the Showtime pay-tv series ""Dexter"" had desynchronized audio/video, instead of taking down ""Dexter"", Kim Schmitz fired off mail saying that fixing the AV problem was a priority.<p>* Mega employees themselves uploaded copies of major motion pictures to the service, such as Luc Besson's _Taken_.<p>* There are Mega emails, on which Kim is apparently CC'd, in which employees enumerate the specific files uploaded to certain high-performing affiliate members, noting (approvingly) that they include copyrighted movies and TV shows. For instance, one line item in an accounting mail: 100 USD [USERNAME DELETED] 10+ Full popular DVD rips (split files), a few small porn movies, some software with keygenerators (warez)<p>There's a widespread misunderstanding of the DMCA on Hacker News and Reddit, and that misunderstanding goes like this: ""to follow the letter of the law, you must somehow be responsive to individual takedown requests from rightsholders"". That is in fact not correct; it only captures part of the responsibility of service providers under the DMCA. Another responsibility, clearly spelled out in the DMCA, is that you can't operate a service with knowledge of specific infringing content. You cannot know that Luc Besson's _Taken_ resides on your service at a specific URL and then simply wait for a rightsholder to request its takedown. If you operate your service knowing that there are specific pieces of copyrighted content on your site that you're ""getting away with"" having because nobody's sent you a takedown, and a prosecutor can show that (for instance, with an email obtained during discovery in which your staff does a line-by-line accounting of a promotional program you ran in which you <i>paid contributors to your site to upload copyrighted material</i>, and in that email you specifically make a case for paying one such prolific uploader <i>more</i> because <i>more of their material is copyrighted</i>), you forfeit safe harbor protections.<p>Finally, and orthogonally, let me just add that while we can't convict Kim Schmitz on the presumption that he is a scumbag fraudster, and the checks and balances in our system of government do require us to dot every 'i' and cross every 't' with regards to chain of custody of evidence, evidentiary standards, and cause for search --- so that if Schmitz escapes his inevitable imprisonment this time, I'll at least be comforted that our legal system takes those issues seriously --- Kim Schmitz gets no such pass in the court of public opinion. The evidence against him in that court is overwhelming. Unless you think the DoJ fabricated his emails, we <i>know</i> he's a crook. You can pretend there's a controversy here, but if you do, my take is you're not allowed to criticize Zynga or evil hedge fund managers and HFTs anymore.",1351785758

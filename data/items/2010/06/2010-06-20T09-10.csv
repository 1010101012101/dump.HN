1446226,comment,1445454,1445593,0,0,OTAThirty,,,"Thanks for the advise, although I disagree with you when you say 'Having ideas is not a skill'. Having idea's is a massive skill and I found this out when working on two great startup. Coders who just code, simply could not think out of the scope of their languages and coding skills, hence they create a great product, but could not think of a single way to monetize it/improve the design aspects of it. I sat back and watched an entire team of very talented coders and PM's battle it out in the board room and yest, no result.<p>I don't think am brilliant, in fact ATM, the exact opposite, am hitting a very depressive time and don't think much of myself at all, but I do remember that day very clearly and when the arguing stopped I simply said, How about we do this and see how we got on, not one person including the founders, had though of it and not one of them disagreed. Anyone out there who has idea's should consider this a massive asset and I encourage it greatly in all types of work places. Too many thinks are done, because ""we've always dont it this way"".<p>Not all idea's are great either and one should know this when throwing idea's to a group of people, accepted criticism is a massive part of being an 'idea person'<p>Again, thanks for the advise above.",1277027368

This boss is hopeless, you can't fix it.<p>3. If you want to have fun, quit and tell him that you want to reclassify all the 1099 income as salary. He'll be liable for all kinds of social security stuff, he'll be in deep trouble with the other devs... That would be a major threat to him.<p>I don't particularly recommend an actual lawsuit, because the money you'd gain from it is so small based on your salary anyway. Also be aware that making such a threat would be extremely disruptive to him, as it would sink his business. So he may resort to more illegal schemes to fight back. Therefore it's probably not worth it - move on!<p>And please blog about it. Other people in your situation need to know about this. Include specific numbers, it helps!",1277027160

1446221,comment,1446034,1446034,0,0,kochbeck,,,"The really unfortunate things about your situation are:<p>1. You're probably legally misclassified as a contractor rather than a full-time employee. You should read IRS Rule 87-41 to understand why that is, but the really telling part is that you're carefully managed as to work down to the minute. Dead giveaway - you're an employee.<p>2. Since you're clearly an employee, you're subject to the protections of FMLA. My favorite nickname for FMLA is the ""F*ing Leave Me Alone"" Act. If you're hospitalized and your employer knows it, it's really unnecessary to invoke FMLA to receive its protections. Your employer violated it by requiring you to work while incapacitated.<p>3. Because you're misclassified, you're probably paying self-employment tax, so you're getting screwed coming and going.<p>4. Your employer is too lazy to figure out how to get benefits for small firms. Going to a trade association like the AeA would easily get you access to insurance at a good rate. I assume he's covered through his spouse, and, as such, doesn't need coverage. So he's letting you hang.<p>IANAL, but I've been an exec who has had to walk in and clean up quite a few shops doing illegal things like this. Here are some options.<p>A) Just leave. Easier said than done, obviously. Also, he almost certainly owes you back overtime as well as back taxes that he didn't deposit consistent with the IRC.<p>B) Contact your state's version of the Labor Board. Explain the situation, and see if they're able to take administrative action on your behalf. This might be a good option for you, because these actions are usually sealed, and they'll order the employer to provide null references in the future.<p>C) Get a lawyer and sue. This can get very messy very quickly, and the real downside of it is that since your pay rate is only about $12.50/hr, even if a court awarded you a year's salary, an attorney on contingency would take half of it, and you'd still be boned. Also, future employers have a way of finding out about employee lawsuits, and it makes you somewhat more unemployable since there's nothing that says they can't discriminate against you based on your past history of litigating against employers.<p>Now, an interesting side option is that I suspect that you don't have an ironclad Intellectual Property and Inventions Assignment agreement with the company, given that he's a management slob. Odds are that it's buried in your contractor agreement which is, itself, a piece of fiction. There might be a severability clause in it, but I bet a judge would vacate the entire agreement if given the chance. That means that you possibly OWN the intellectual property of the company. Which is to say, in effect, that you own the core asset of the company since the IP and the client list are probably its only assets.<p>I can't speak for you to say whether you WANT to own this company's core asset, and certainly if you owned the IP and licensed it back to the founder, you'd have the joy of having to continue working with him for as long as that went on. But since the company is successfully signing customers and is turning over about $400k a year, that may well be a lucrative path to pursue.<p>Anyhow, the way you'd look into that is to contact the local branch of the nearest major municipality's bar association. Almost all of them have a referral service, and it's usually cheap or free. An attorney will probably give you an hour or so to go over the case and figure out if it's a good idea to act or just jump ship.<p>I wish you luck, and I hope your next employer appreciates you more than your current one does.",1277026837
1446220,comment,1446034,1446077,0,0,Tichy,,,"Personally, I would not even want to work for this company anymore, even with better terms. Not sure if there would be a point in trying to get some compensation for the last years, though (ie using the ""you did some illegal stuff and I know about it"" angle)? I probably wouldn't bother and just move on, but that might be where I am too soft.<p>Edit: reading some of the other comments, with respect to being too soft. Perhaps it would be worth consulting a lawyer, and let them do the dirty work. Being too soft and letting other people take advantage for you could be a good reason for hiring a hard-nosed lawyer.<p>The danger might be to be taken advantage of by the lawyer, too. But my mother actually once had a lawyer get her a lot of money from her employer, and he said ""it is not only important because of the money, but because of you"". I was really impressed by that - certainly dragging this nagging feeling around that you are a loser also takes it's toll, so fighting it out might be worth it.",1277026714

Ask him to be ""upgraded"" to a real employee (he'll say no, as we suspect)<p>2. Tell him you understand his decision, and since he wants you to be freelance, you will work for him as a true freelancer, e.g. for a certain number of hours, at a certain hourly wage, at your own home, at the hours you choose.<p>3. He may ""fire"" you. However, if you are as indispensable as it sounds like you are, he will come crawling back to you. In any case, he won't fire you until he sucks know-how out of your brain, which he would do over the course of a month of freelance work. So you have some time to do the transition.<p>P.S.

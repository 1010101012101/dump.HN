88930,comment,88296,88438,0,0,shayan,,,"well if you already have a feature complete beta, and all that is left to do is to make it look pretty, then congrats and I would recommend the following.  You don't necessarily need money right now! Try to get a small group of beta users on your system, see their reactions and take their feedback.  Then try to slowly grow this group to get more people using it.  It is <i>always</i> a lot easier to raise money with a working product and some users on it.  For doing any of these you guys don't have to quit your day jobs, if you have managed to get this far without quiting I am sure this will be doable too.  Or you can do what the guy's at hotmail did (read the second chapter in Founders at Work) one person quits and the other works and they share the income, until they get to a point that they can get funding or generate revenue.<p>\nAlso as a reminder, the more you have achieved, and the more you have to show, not only the easier you can get funding, but the higher you will be <i>evaluated</i>, which is definitely to your benefit.  I would say giving out shares and raising money <i>just</i> so you can pay for your life expenses is not the best idea, get a line of credit!<p>Anyways, it looks like you are in better shape than I thought.  All the best to you.",1197505404

88928,comment,88898,88898,0,0,hhm,,,"I have an idea for the Reddit people. The old people was the one you got when the community at Reddit was the old community, but the community now is a lot bigger, as there is a lot of people that there wasn't here then, and there is a lot of people that is gone too. So, imagine you want the old users to get the classic Reddit experience again, how would you do it? Just identify who the classic Reddit users were (that's easy, just check the time at which they did sign up) and let them access to a Classic Interface, where karma counts as if only they were part of the Reddit community, and nobody else.<p>That would make the new reddit behave as the old reddit.<p>Would that be feasible?",1197505278
88927,comment,88914,88914,0,0,myoung8,,,"It seems like most internships are not so much a ""free trial"" for the internee, but an extended, interactive interview and test of skills, personality, and attitude. They exist so that firms don't get stuck with inept workers.<p>There are also significant costs associated with interns (e.g. training, relocation) which are depreciated if the intern gets hired. Having an intern program like he describes would definitely see an increase in those costs, which makes it a disincentive for firms to have such a program.<p>That said, I'd love to have the opportunity to intern anywhere at any stage in my life.",1197505266

1429211,comment,1428432,1428602,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"""Web 2.0"" doesn't have a crisp definition. It encompasses a huge variety of things ranging from google maps to flickr. Overall it represents anything that feels like a step up from the web 1.0ish static html, grey background world.<p>A few defining characteristics of many ""web 2.0"" sites:<p>- Application vs. static content, nearly all content is dynamically generated, per user<p>- Use of AJAX to provide responsive interactivity instead of whole-page-refresh per-click<p>- Social media aspects, leverage of user generated content in the form of comments, media, etc.<p>- Use of web-centric graphic and usability design. No more default gray backgrounds, no more horrid framed interfaces, no more geocities syndrome. Tight, coherent layout trending toward minimalism. Use of proven usability enhancement accepted standards such as breadcrumbs, search, standard header or footer navigation menu, ""click logo to go to home page"", etc.<p>All of these trends led to a flowering of 2nd generation uses of the web which generally became lumped into the ""web 2.0"" category.<p>A web-store with an animated ""under construction"" banner that uses mostly default fonts and colors, contains a simple home page of static content which links to a few pages filled with tables of inventory listings and instructions on how to send in orders via email, phone, and by printing out/filling in/mailing an order form is web 1.0. A web-store that is sleekly designed with full searchability as well as browsing by category/manufacturer/what-have-you, a proper shopping cart system, a full detail page for each item with an image, detailed description including formatted details and maybe customer reviews, per-item inventory tracking, etc. is web 2.0.",1276505336
1429210,comment,1428537,1428915,0,0,simonsquiff,,,"That's genuinely very very impressive.<p>I think all the web commentary about whether the pixels are visible or not are missing the point.  The point is that thinks that were not readable (or resolvable) now are.  For instance on the NYT page, on the 3gs screenshot only the main headlines are readable.  On the 4 phone, everything is.  That's a huge usability improvement.
Additionally a number of the stylist elements on the iphone don't look that great at lower resolution but amazing at the higher one.  The obvious one is the inset text effect used for the browser header (i.e. the white inset on text),it almost looks like ghosting on the 3gs whilst on the 4 it looks like a crisp inset.  The same goes for the inset icons at the bottom.
I have to look hard to see pixels on my 3gs; things looking less pixely isn't the news, things being more resolvable is.",1276505233

1429207,comment,1428537,1428692,0,0,cheald,,,"1. Not likely on the iPad, because in order to get 326 PPI on a 9.7"" diagonal device, you have to pack 2530 x 1898 pixels onto it, which is 610% increase over the currently shipping specs. That kind of display takes a lot of power to drive, and would perform extremely poorly compared to a similar device at 1024x768.<p>The iPad already reportedly falls pretty flat under conditions that tax the GPU's fillrate. Sextupling the amount of work that the GPU has to do likely wouldn't do the device any favors for performance or battery life, both of which are key marketing points.<p>Googling seems to indicate that the iPad has an A4 Mali GPU, which has a fillrate of about 100M pix/sec (by comparison, my desktop's Radeon 4850 has a fillrate of ~24 billion pix/sec). Each paint operation paints a certain number of pixels, and you'll do several of those per frame. At 1024x768 (786,432 pixels), the maximum fillrate-limited FPS to paint a one-pass single-color surface is about 127 FPS. Now, increase that to 2530x1898 (4801940 pixels) and your max FPS for the same operation drops to about 21 FPS - and that's just for painting a single color. Actually doing anything useful would utterly destroy the device. To compensate, they'd have to put in a beefier (more power-hungry) GPU. It's quite possible to build a device that would perform well at those specs, but it would be very expensive, and very difficult to fit into Apple's typical sexy form factors with any appreciable battery life.<p>(It's been a few years since I've done high-performance graphics work, so if I'm off here, someone please correct me.)",1276504946

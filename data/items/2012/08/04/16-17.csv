4338899,comment,4338317,4338569,4,0,sharmajai,,,"While you provided an accurate description of the Indian culture, your comment does not address the issue at hand.<p>The biggest problem according to me lies in the Indian culture; We don't challenge authority enough to pursue our dreams.<p>In Indian culture most decisions that matter are made for children by their parents.  Disobeying your parents has an associated stigma to it.  While this being a good thing for holding the families together, and arguably increasing happiness, this can be a deterrent to developing a person's individuality and self confidence.<p>So while it is difficult for well wishing parents to suggest a high-risk, high-reward path for their children (it's not their dream after all), which involves the child following a sport which he/she is good at, the children's subservience hamper independent thinking required to pursue their dream on their own.  IMHO this is the primary cause of the herd mentality that we see so very often in India.<p>This herd mentality causes a catch22, where prior successes are required in a sport for parent-approved children's participation, and due to lack of participation there aren't any successes.<p>Of course there are miracles, but unfortunately not very often.  For example, I attribute a lot of the participation in cricket and as a result the top class Indian cricket team that we see today, to the miracle named 'Sachin Tendulkar'[1] - one of the best batsmen that the sports has ever seen.<p>But with the modernization(westernization?) of the Indian culture, things are looking better.  Looking at India's history at the Olympics[2], recently we have started seeing successes across a variety of sports - shooting, boxing, and badminton.  I hope this trend continues and helps convince more parents to let their children pursue their dreams and not be just another rat in the rat race.  And also convince a lot more children that challenging the authority can sometimes be a good thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_at_the_Olympics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_at_the_Olympics</a>",1344098618

I remember seeing a statistic that shows most of today's most successful stocks started out bombing at their IPOs.<p>I didn't mean to come out as an armchair expert, just a believer in common sense. I reached my opinion by bundling the stock drop with: 1) Facebook's ""ad click bots"" story (I had a similar problem when I advertised on FB years back and have been hearing on and off about Facebook ad problems a lot over the years. 2) The revelation that at minimum 10% of FB accounts are fake (still not a bad percentage assuming it isn't secretly higher). 3) Revenue being based mainly on advertising (whose 0.1% click-through rate is going down each and every year). 4) FB getting closer to reaching its maximum realistically possible users. 5) A serious lack of innovation, drive, diversifying or anything at all going on at Facebook. 6) Near zero horizontal growth with no sign of vertical growth either.<p>At the moment it's just a sitting duck. I mean, my God what have they really done all these years? When a company branches out too far we call it a ""Microsoft"", when it has all branches and no trunk we call it a ""Yahoo"", and when it has only a trunk without branches it's now a ""Facebook"".

Net worth is thus the difference in value between total assets and total liabilities or debt. Total assets are defined as the sum of: (1) the gross value of owner-occupied housing; (2) other real estate owned by the household; (3) cash and demand deposits; (4) time and savings deposits, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts; (5) government bonds, corporate bonds, foreign bonds, and other financial securities; (6) the cash surrender value of life insurance plans; (7) the cash surrender value of pension plans, including IRAs, Keogh, and 401(k) plans; (8) corporate stock and mutual funds; (9) net equity in unincorporated businesses; and (10) equity in trust funds. Total liabilities are the sum of: (1) mortgage debt; (2) consumer debt, including auto loans; and (3) other debt.<p>This measure reflects wealth as a store of value and therefore a source of potential consumption. I believe that this is the concept that best reflects the level of well-being associated with a familys holdings. Thus, only assets that can be readily converted to cash (that is, fungible ones) are included.<p>Please note that this is only the source of the numbers The Atlantic used in their comparison. The Atlantic did the actual poll asking people for how they think the distribution looks.",1344098480

Children with talent (or at least some signs of it) are taken at a very young age (~5 y/o) and intensively trained.<p>> Importing a group of people just for the sole purpose of racking up medals (non withstanding the inherent creepiness of it) will be tremendously expensive. How do you justify the expense if the children don't want to do it eventually?<p>Will it be expensive? I made this suggestion based on the assumption that, as with the IT industry, it's more cost efficient to bring in workers from abroad than to depend on domestic talent. In any case, from what I can tell, the main costs come from buying equipment and hiring coaches, not from the children. All you have to do is pay for their food, shelter, schooling, and other basic needs.<p>The children of course will not be forced to remain in the program if they do not want to. Contrary to popular belief, this is the system used by China - no one is kidnapped or coerced into participating, although that no doubt happens in North Korea.<p>In any case, the US policy would be that at any point, they can quit and go back home, if they so desire. Citizenship would be reserved for those who stick with the program until they are of Olympic age (of course, there would be weeding out as well, so the numbers would be relatively low). And even if they end up going back at the age of 10, they would have greatly benefited from just getting nutritious food during a crucial part of their childhood - child malnutrition rates in India are almost 50%, even higher than those in sub-Saharan Africa. Childhood malnutrition leads to lifelong physical and mental infirmity, so the children would no doubt benefit.<p>There's no denying the creepiness to some people, although I don't see it that way (America is a nation of immigrants who came for a better life, and that would describe these kids perfectly). This would be a cost-efficient and humane way to reassert US Olympic dominance over China, something that a lot of people are concerned with.",1344097819

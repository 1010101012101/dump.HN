Who determines what's ""appropriate""?  Usually that terminology is employed when referring to <i>social convention</i>, and social convention is determined by majority opinion.<p>Quoting PG:<p><i>But the best thing of all is when people call what you're doing inappropriate.

3116221,comment,3114859,3115859,3,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"""an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model""<p>I've read that some dozens of times from Blank.<p>Sounds like a guy opening a pizza shop knows better what he's doing than the IT startups Blank is talking about!<p>Not all IT startups have to be less well directed than a pizza shop!  Bluntly, for a well planned startup, I conclude that Blank is nearly always wrong.<p>I helped start a company, now world famous.  In my offer letter I was promised stock.  Later the COB said that the amount would be $500,000.  I never got the stock.  That stock would be worth about $500 million now.  Yup, I missed out.  But I did get some startup experience.  Got'a tell you, what Blank said didn't describe what we were doing at all.  We always knew JUST what our business model was, and we were correct from the beginning to the present.  It wasn't tough to know.  Sometimes Blank is seriously wrong.<p>""You've bootstrapped your company.""  From what PG wrote, sounds like I don't have much choice:  No matter what ""more"" it takes, I have to have it done before a VC will write a check.  But, then, as you said, I will already have ""bootstrapped"" my company.<p>""I imagine you'll find that you need a lot more than a static IP address and 15 Mbps upload bandwidth to get there though.""  Sure.  The point about the static IP address and the 15 Mbps upload bandwidth was just to illustrate that by the time I've got the ""more"" done and am ready to go live, we're not talking bucks big enough to eat up an average Series A.  Instead we're talking much less cash that it would take to keep a new pizza shop going for the first week.<p>My point isn't how much an entrepreneur needs to do.  My point is that by the time the entrepreneur has gone live, gotten significant traction, and has the traction going, and, thus, qualified for VC funding, if he can half fill 15 Mbps upload bandwidth, then he won't want to take VC money.<p>Put more simply, PG is saying that the VCs want to get on the plane after it has already left the ground.  Okay by me.  I'm just trying to understand the rules of the game.<p>I didn't mention it, but my guess is that the severe rules PG is describing have been 'suggested' by the LPs.",1318726032
3116220,comment,3115951,3116094,5,0,wtallis,,,"You're misunderstanding the purpose of patents. They're not a reward to be granted for every useful invention. Patents exist only to be an incentive for innovation. In almost every case where several inventors are competing to get the invention ready to patent, there is enough natural incentive that the patent is not necessary. In those cases, granting a patent can just as easily slow down the pace of technological progress, by forcing every inventor that didn't get the patent to either stop working in that area or negotiate a patent license before they can continue working to improve the invention.",1318725952

You folks need to take a deep breath and then ask yourself if your support for your 'civil right' to consume something trumps the right of the person who produced the work in question to decided for themselves how the work should enter and survive in the marketplace. Because all I hear these days is that your desire to consume without renumeration is all that matters. Any deviation from that tucks into some part of the copyright conspiracy boogeyman.<p>The most important right is that an individual should get to decide how their own works are treated - want to give it away for free? Want to set up your own torrent? Want to charge for it? It should be an individual's choice what they do with their work; you have no right to make that choice for them and it is a painfully shameful that capitalism's consumerist end has come to long polemics on why stealing something isn't -  and now watching torrents of The Office is a civil right.<p>There is an important statue being dedicated tomorrow in Washington DC - some of you folks should turn off Pirate Bay and pay attention to things that are actually worth caring about.<p>By the way, I lost my single karma point to bring up the issue of individual control.

Depending on how one measures somewhere between 40% and 70% of health care costs are used to treat lifestyle diseases (too much stress, too much food, not enough exercise) like high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, tobacco, alcohol, avoidable accidents, etc. Those problems are not genetic. They're behavioral.<p>Of course one can suffer these things without having the risk factors. I presume the experts who calculated those numbers corrected for that.<p>So in about half the cases (half the cost to be precise), sickness really is your fault.<p>One of the reasons high deductible plans have such low premiums despite not screwing people over with small print is that they attract a more healthy segment of the population, because a high deductible creates some incentive to avoid those [preventable] diseases.<p>As it is, people are only hit on their regular expensive plans if they smoke. Imagine if they were also hit with higher premiums if they were overweight (BMI>25, 2/3s of Americans are overweight), drank too much, smoked too much, didn't engage in regular physical activity, etc. Then the premiums for those who have a lifestyle which wasn't likely to cause chronic diseases would only pay half of what they're currently paying.

3116171,comment,3114619,3115980,4,0,dsr_,,,"Why is she unhappy?<p>At a basic level, it's because her mental model of How Things Work broke. She thinks that it's reasonable that using the Amazon Kindle application <i>on any platform</i> she ought to be able to buy books from Amazon as part of that app. After all, she's signed in, Amazon knows who she is, at most they ought to ask for a password confirmation to let her spend her money.<p>And that doesn't work.<p>So she was unhappy with Amazon. Reasonable. She was so unhappy, she posted on Facebook about it, where a dozen of her friends pointed out that Apple wanted a 30% cut of content sold on their device.<p>Their device. Not her device. She paid for it, but now she sees that it isn't hers.<p>She thought that an iPod was like a computer: you use it, you select software to put on it, you use the software.<p>Her mental model breaks AGAIN, because she thought she owned the iPod. Now she finds out that it's actually an Apple-owned store that doesn't like competition.<p>Apple got their benefit when they sold her a device. They got more benefit when they sell her software to go on the device. Why should they get more benefit for interfering in a transaction between her and Amazon?<p>She knows what rent-seeking means, and she doesn't appreciate it.",1318723900

3116167,comment,3116120,3116120,11,0,dos1,,,"I cannot stress how much I agree about exercise. About 6 years ago I started going to the gym regularly* and lifting.  That was really one of the best single changes I've made in my life.  I feel more energized during the day (no more coffee!) and I feel like my mental acuity is higher.  My memory seems better and I'm generally in a much better mood (partly because I look so much more fit!)<p>* When I say regularly, I mean I went every other day for 6 months without missing a workout. I made it a high priority.  After 6 months of that, I felt so guilty if I missed a workout that I've more or less continued that schedule for the last 5.5 years.",1318723736

Banks charge sometime $25 just to do a wire transfer, and for your 5%, you would still be winning at anything up to $500. $5 per $100 would be ok by me if it solved an immediate problem. Quicker and cheaper than FedEx.<p>My main concern for you would be, doesn't it cost thousands to register as a bank? Which surely you will be?",1318723490

6386225,comment,6385448,6386012,6,0,pcl,,,"An em space is the width of the letter <i>m</i>. IIRC, a normal space in most proportional fonts is closer to the letter <i>n</i>.<p>It has always been my understanding that historically, typographers tended to prefer em spaces between sentences (vs. after intra-sentence punctuation like &#x27;Mr.&#x27; or a comma). And so, once typewriters with their fixed-width fonts came out, people used a double-space at the end of a sentence to approximate an em space.<p>The frustrating thing, typographically-speaking, is that the HTML approach doesn&#x27;t map to the manually-typeset process, either, since it doesn&#x27;t have any semantic knowledge about &quot;end of sentence&quot; vs. &quot;random intra-sentence punctuation&quot; and thus treats them all the same.<p>(Note that this is also where we get <i>em dashes</i> and <i>en dashes</i> from. And just like em spaces and en spaces, an em dash is transliterated to &#x27;--&#x27; in fixed-width fonts.)<p>  For all I know, the double-space trick was used with fixed-width letterpress before the advent of typewriters. The problem seems to have more to do with fixed-width than with typewriters.",1379177983

That&#x27;s bad for democratic systems in a practical sense as well: it contributes to political instability and media circus.<p>It also promotes deceiptful or just weird practice through the dynamics around preferencing. The recent Australian election came up with some bizarre outcomes in the senate due to the quirks of PR. Tradeoffs to try and correct for this lead to more problems, such as in Germany where CDU voters feel they need to vote for the FDP in some regions to try and get them over minimum quota to avoid a worse option getting through. There&#x27;s been elections where tickets try to game the elimination order by flowing votes through parties from the other side of the divide, but then get the math predictions wrong: in the senate vote for Victoria in the 2004 Australian federal election - voters for the mainstream left party accidentally elected a Christian values party to a balance of power role in the upper house ahead of the Greens because the party men botched an attempt to stay ahead of the greens in elimination.<p>There are lots of quick clean wins that most western electoral systems could implement that don&#x27;t have the drawbacks of PR:<p>* Boundary-setting by independent electoral commissions.

Compulsory preferential voting forces people to make a decision even about the electoral order of people they dislike (which is definitely in the spirit of forced democracy of the Athenians)<p>* Removing party names from the ballot paper while introducing random sorting of names across the ballot reduces the value of party brand and leaflets, whilst evening out the resulting increase donkey vote.<p>* Restrictions to political advertising: ways that money can be spent, ways it can be raised, cutoffs before the election.<p>* Mechanisms to reduce the benefit of incombancy over other groups.",1379176662

The reality appears to be that for things like minor traffic offences, you can wind up spending more time and far more money travelling to have your day in court than you would have lost if you just paid up under protest, and you might also be risking a higher penalty if the court does find you guilty of exactly what you were previously charged with.<p>With motoring offences there is also the points system to consider, so it might be worth going to court for that reason. However, generally someone prosecuted but found not guilty in the UK doesn&#x27;t seem to get any sort of compensation for even actual financial losses they incur defending themselves, never mind the value of their lost time or anything to make up for the obvious distress for an extended period that going to court in these cases is likely to cause.<p>It&#x27;s rather like the small claims track.

Accel Partners, just the SV office: <a href=""http://www.accel.com/#people"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accel.com/#people</a>.<p>I count 15 of 23 that have either an undergraduate degree or an MBA from an Ivy-league school or Stanford. Mostly HBS/GSB. That&#x27;s 65% representation, relative to the less than 1% of undergraduates who graduate from the Ivy league.<p>Now, you can theorize that maybe it&#x27;s because people who get into these schools are smart to begin with, and would have been equally successful elsewhere. But there is a lot of overlap in predictors between these schools and the ones right behind them. E.g. SAT Math interquartile ranges for Duke are 690/780 and the ones for Princeton are 710/800, and within that narrow range also fall Northwestern, Stanford, U Chicago, Penn, Columbia, Harvard, and Yale. The student bodies at these schools overlap more than they differ. If the key differentiator was the quality of the people coming in and not pedigree by itself, you would see a more graduated drop-off in representation.<p>I think it&#x27;s obvious that the pipelines that Harvard/Yale/Princeton/Wharton/Stanford have to elite organizations in finance are a huge boost for people who have the option to acquire that credential, distinct from the qualifications those people come in with.",1379174563

I use Perl a lot. They are at 5.8.0, which is not bad, but not the very latest. Of course you can install your own anything (perl, python, ruby, etc.) in user space, which makes library management more simple too.<p>Unknowns: I've never had it tested under a serious load. Just playing around.<p>I WISH there was a host that gave me the speed, simplicity and low price of HE but also supported more than one domain name on the same account (for the same price). There are sites that do that, but typically they have something else wrong with them, such as having the ""feature"" of being control-panel based.",1214703860

How much should we be willing to pay to implement the second set?<p>The thing that always gets me about this debate, and the energy debates in general, is that energy efficiency is still far and away the most productive energy investment around: what is needed is ways for individual consumers to make those investment easily.",1214703752
230901,comment,230734,230822,0,0,thwarted,,,"An operating system monopoly is not necessarily the problem, it's when an operating system monopoly is used to gain a monopoly on applications.  In the same way users don't care about diversity, they don't care about operating systems.  They care about applications.  If Microsoft Office ran on other operating systems AND OPERATED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY (which excludes Microsoft's attempts to have Office and IE on the Mac), then the user could still get help from friends when stuff breaks and share documents.<p>It may have been someone else, but perhaps that someone else would have been about encourages standards and interoperability and not <i>application</i> lock-in.",1214703508

Even reverse dns lookups might be partly helpful but if someone controls the ip they could change that easily...<p>Interesting problem over.  I love the service though.  Congrats guys!",1214703138

A guy who tells you that hard work and risk taking will improve your chances from 1% to 5% in a one field but will improve them from 1% to 50% with less risk in another is giving you information that is actually worth something.",1214702857

Either the predicted bad things happened the last time temps hit the predicted levels or they didn't.  If they didn't, why is this time different?  And no, ""humans weren't around"" isn't an answer.<p>We know of times when the temperatures were higher than the projections.  We also know what was happening on earth at that time.  If those things don't match the predictions for the effects of global warming....<p>We also know of times when the CO2 levels were much higher than today and the temperatures then.

230884,comment,230665,230665,0,0,h34t,,,"I would quietly & politely leave, possibly after a candid, thoughtful conversation with the founder in question. Or, I would be quiet and put up with it.<p>Five years ago, at 20 years old, I was offered an amazing opportunity -- running leadership conferences across Canada, and leading teams of youth around the world to promote business/development. I'd been running projects with the organization for a couple of years and absolutely loved it.<p>Then, I discovered that the founder was committing fraud with taxpayer money -- criminal mismanagement. Had anyone gone to the media, it would have been a juicy scandal involving taxpayer money (but that would only have hurt the youth involved). He was hurting himself, his family, and at times even putting people in danger.<p>After consulting mentors I trusted (an ethics law professor, retired business person and retired diplomat)and a five hour conversation with the President, I turned down his bribes and caused a minor but localized fuss in a genuine attempt to improve the situation. It was unsuccessful.<p>Even though I was right, and even though my mentors and friends verified this and helped me form my actions, I would have been <i>much</i> better off by keeping my mouth shut, politely declining their job offer, and simply shifting my focus to creating my own future.<p>This would have avoided the stress of going through hell in a fruitless attempt to make things better, that most people would never understand and would leave me disconnected to a group of people I loved being apart of (aside for just the couple of people who were causing all this nonsense) -- I was disconnected from them because I couldn't explain why I was taking action without endangering the good that the org. was also doing for a lot of young people. ie. I didn't want to harm the org. by actually having the media get wind of it.<p>So next time I will button my lip, acknowledge the world exactly as it is, and stay focused on what I want my own life to be instead of getting hung up on others..",1214701870

I have the impression that he could just as easily have written an equally seemingly brilliant book about how people who make spot decisions usually get it wrong.<p>So no, what I'm looking for is more of a survey of the experimental research on consciousness and identity, the kind of thing that this latest study would fit into. There are a host of such findings and the area seems ripe for an overview. The closest thing I know is ""The User Illusion"" by Tor Nørretranders. It's a good source on some of this material (e.g. fascinating results on priming which demonstrate that our thinking is conditioned by subliminal perceptions). But it's out of date and also rather shallow (the inevitable tying in of Gödel and all that).",1214701853

If we wanted to be rational we could just look at the numbers and realize that over 80% of startups fail and mention that when on the phone with prospective clients!<p>My point is that it's not a good idea to get overly worked up about someone in sales stretching the truth a bit.  Sales is the part of the organization that responds to customer needs, and so if they promise a feature to a client, you as the developer are more likely to end up building that feature than if it was never promised and the sale was lost.<p>It's an imperfect system, but at its core it's not any different from Ford running a commercial that suggests that its operations actually benefit the environment.  People believe what they want to believe in order to give themselves an excuse to buy what they want.  If the founder in question is outright lying, then he's just not very good at helping customers rationalize the purchase.... :)",1214701538

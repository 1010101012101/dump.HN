Otherwise there’s not too much going on, and WV is the second poorest state (by median household income) in the US and has the second lowest life expectancy, both after Mississippi, and has the lowest proportion of college graduates of any state.<p>As a matter of national policy, I’m not sure what the best way is to help West Virginia. Better federal support for their healthcare, education, and anti-poverty programs would be a start, but what they really need is a more diversified economy. It’s a hard problem. Coal mining is on its way out one way or another, with continuing low gas prices, dropping solar/wind prices, and increasing national and international concern about CO2 emissions.",1446929986

Employees are at the mercy of powerful employers, so they learn to take advantage of the system.

The question was not, &quot;Do all major RDBMSs support the same subset of the SQL standard?&quot;<p>The implied concern with the new question is portability of code across databases. This is a red herring based only on some snippets of SQL syntax and features.[0]<p>Even if the SQL were identical, no major RDBMS has as its selling point that it only supports the SQL standard. Additionally, even with identical SQL, the implementations in each RDBMS are different enough that logically equivalent code would still need to be rewritten.<p>One example: There is nothing in the SQL standard about optimization of queries. One place this shines through is in Postgres CTEs vs MS SQL Server CTEs (I cannot speak to other implementations). In Postgres, a CTE is an optimization boundary - predicates from the query utilizing a CTE will not be pushed down into the CTE. The entire CTE is executed each time it is referenced. This is in contrast to the behavior of sub-queries, which do support predicates being pushed down into them. In SQL Server, CTEs are just an in-line view definition and do support predicates being pushed into the CTE from the outer query. Any codebase converting from MS SQL Server to Postgres would need to have every instance of CTE use evaluated for performance.<p>[0] The previously linked deck highlights only some advanced excerpts of the SQL standard. The venn diagram of supported SQL constructs is much more overlap than exclusive.",1446928627

It is true that believing in the company mission makes more hours tolerable. This is the main reason its easier to work long hours for yourself or your own startup than it is to work long hours for a company you don&#x27;t own, and why the larger a company gets, the more demoralizing severe overtime can be.<p>But - people throw around numbers like 80 and 100+ easily, I&#x27;m not always convinced real-world numbers are as high as people claim they are. Having done some extended 80 hour crunches, I know first-hand that all life outside of work stops above 65-70 hours/week. At 80, you can still get 8 hours of sleep per day and have one meal away from work, maybe watch a single 30 or 45 minute TV show to relax, but almost nothing else. While it happens, it is not particularly sustainable. 100+ hours means you&#x27;re eating into your sleep schedule.<p>I know first-hand that many people exaggerate their long hours in crunch times, and most crunches where people claimed 80, they were pulling more like 65-70. And I don&#x27;t believe they are lying intentionally, its just that extra hours can be harder than you think, and the perception is you work more than you think you do. A studio I worked at measured work hours during crunch time and found most people work 10-20 hours less than they thought they did.

Maybe it&#x27;s possible if you simply spend several hours a day in meetings or wasting time, but that is another issue altogether.<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that these 80 hour work weeks people brag about actually boil down to an anecdote about a terrible week they once had when they needed to get the job done quickly or lose their company. People that don&#x27;t really understand what this kind of work entails just perpetuate these ideas because of some perverse idea of work ethic they get from reading about irrational people like Elon Musk.<p>I&#x27;ve got some breaking news for this &quot;CEO&quot; if he is for real and actually thinks an 80 hour work week is in any way a decent idea; the thing you are creating is not that important.

I agree that being able to do things in the shell is helpful if you are somewhat regularly doing that type of work. I question how useful it is if someone learns that in high school or college and then needs to apply it to do a task years down the road.<p>Edit: In other words it&#x27;s not like learning how to ride a bike or play tennis.",1446926727

Rather, it’s about optimizing work-life imbalance&quot;<p>Translation: If I use the word &quot;optimizing&quot; in this sentence, the crushing work load I&#x27;m about to give you will seem like a rational choice rather than bare exploitation.<p>> &quot;Long nights and weekends spent away from families are the norm in the startup world. We often chuckle at glamorized notions of the startup lifestyle: table tennis games, fully stocked kitchens and generous stock options.&quot;<p>Translation: We know what it&#x27;s <i>really</i> like to work in a startup - having families and fair pay are luxuries we know don&#x27;t really exist. Anyone who expects otherwise is lazy and doesn&#x27;t fit with our &quot;culture&quot;.<p>> &quot;We work long hours, we are not paid much, and even after raising over $10-million within our first year of operations, we still have a mountain to climb in our efforts to expand this company.&quot;<p>Translation: While <i>you</i> might not be paid much, <i>I</i> hold a majority stake in the company and will be handsomely rewarded for your hard work when the company gets bought. And just because we raised $10 million doesn&#x27;t mean any of you are getting a raise.<p>> &quot;We have also ensured that each employee has an unyielding belief in the company’s mission. If anyone in the office doesn’t believe they’re a part of something incredibly meaningful that will truly reinvent banking, they’ll likely struggle to relate to their co-workers and eventually “burn out.”<p>Translation: I mean... they&#x27;re going to burn out anyway after working 80 hours every week, but forced belief in the &quot;mission&quot; of the company allows us to squeeze a couple more months of hard work out of them before they finally quit, feeling guilty and ashamed of their perceived failure.<p>> &quot;Our husbands and wives help pick up the slack on our long days, and our kids put a smile on our faces after stressful meetings. Many of our team members have young families, and we do our best to respect their needs through flexible hours and by encouraging the ability to work from home when needed.&quot;<p>Translation: I mean, I&#x27;m not a <i>monster</i> - if someone wants to spend a portion of their 14 hour work day at home, using their own computer and resources, of course we&#x27;ll accommodate them. Far be it from me to prevent my employees from bringing all the stress of their work lives into their homes.<p>> &quot;While the work can be challenging, the rewards are endless.&quot;<p>Translation: The rewards for me, that is. For you, the rewards are very much finite.<p>> &quot;Having said that, it takes a special kind of personality to seek out (and succeed in) such an uncertain and risky environment. At the end of the day, I guess you still need to be a little nuts to succeed in a startup.&quot;<p>Translation: Young, well-off techies without families or hobbies who can afford to live on breadcrumbs and are healthy enough to keep our insurance costs minimal to the front of the line.",1446926680

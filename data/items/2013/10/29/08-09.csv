I use facebook, for me its a great to keep in touch with my friends and family members who are all over the world. I have a friend who doesn&#x27;t want to jump in to the facebook bandwagon and our mutual friends thinks he is crazy for not using facebook. The side effect is he almost never gets invited if there is a get together and have no idea whats going with most of our mutual friends. He does have a close group of friends he keeps in touch with (like me, on phone or whatsapp).<p>I hate facebook&#x27;s privacy implications, I sympathize with his views.

This has been the subject of a big lawsuit with Facebook: <a href=""http://fusion.net/modern_life/story/german-state-fine-facebook-allowing-psuedonyms-7716"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fusion.net/modern_life/story/german-state-fine-facebo...</a><p>Regarding the second set of questions, that&#x27;s the big question right now. IANAL, but the &quot;my house&quot; is a domicile related context. While Facebook is not a domicile, they <i>are</i> a company, and a company can set their own policies. The challenge is that the people using Facebook aren&#x27;t really employees, and they are using it like a public forum, which it isn&#x27;t. There are a lot of social issues revolving around this. There&#x27;s also the 3rd party doctrine to take into account (which incidentally is how NSA is justifying a lot of their monitoring).<p>In terms of government ID being mandatory, you have two issues: one, that while many countries do have a national ID, the US does not. Second, if you require an ID for a website, then you run into all kinds of issues: data retention, access privilege, fraud problems, etc. South Korea had a related law which they abandoned in 2012 after several years, and China just adopted one.<p>So the general answer is &quot;it&#x27;s complicated, it&#x27;s a discussion much longer than a hnn thread offers, and nobody really knows yet.&quot; Hope that helped :)",1383036884

If fact, I mentioned that the government would be needed for this purpose. I don&#x27;t claim that there would be no abuses, but I can&#x27;t see how it could possibly be as riddled with abuse as our current system.

They will also feel a greater sense of personal violation when someone they know abuses the system. I know several people who claim that they know so and so who are collecting welfare and making all kinds of money under the table. If they feel a personal with that money and that system, they are more likely to report that person or at least discourage them.

We could probably assume civilizations capable of interstellar trade would have advanced enough genetic engineering and biological 3D printing such that trading lifeforms and their by-products between planets wouldn&#x27;t be required. Different planets, with different atmospheres, geologies and ecosystems, would lead to comparative advantages in production though, which is the primary incentive behind trade relations. However the  net benefit of trading would be at least partially offset by the cost of transporting goods over such long distances. With low thrust, high efficiency engines attached to the cargo the cost could be low enough to make trading an economic benefit, but that would require even longer time periods between the production of a good and its being put to good use. Civilizations would have to plan ahead and estimate the supply and demand many years, centuries or millenia into the future. You could really have a lot of fun with this kind of analysis.

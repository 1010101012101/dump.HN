If you go to an event or a bar, there is a lopsided ratio of men to women. The women who are out, are typically insane. The cool women you want to meet are actually on OKCupid because they are tired of being surrounded by dirtbags and nerds (and insane women). So OkCupid works well for a man dating in SF, because that's where the normal, interesting, good-looking women are.<p>In NYC the scene is the opposite. The bars and events are overrun with attractive women. The weird trolls are the ones hanging out on OKC. Thus, if you move across country to NYC and update your OKC location, you'll start getting tons of messages from tattooed roller-derby girls who have pet snakes. The type you were tired of meeting at the bars in SF.<p>YMMV, I'll grant that maybe YC has inspired a generation of debonair hackers to move to SF and clean up with all the amazing local women.",1277409156

I currently work on Good Noows in my spare time and I earn my living as a Product Manager at a mobile network operator. I started Good Noows because I simply couldnt find a news reader out there that serves my needs. I assume thats because it's very hard to get funding for it. Google Reader is top when it comes to functionality but I dont agree with their UI. Good Noows tries to address two segments of users and I hope that both are served ok-ish (feedback is actually quite good): 1) RSS reader users sharing my customer pain for a better browsing experience, and 2) the average consumer who doesnt even know what RSS is and just wants to set up a personal news stream (the twitter-like terminology with ""stream"" and ""follow"" is intended). Simple and quick.<p>- No we dont get paid for listing feeds. I'd love that because it would be a great business model.<p>- Sorry if the predefined sources in the catalog are not what you are looking for. Since I am German I do not have a complete overview of i.e. US-American politics blogs. I definitely was not biased when choosing them. I just used Technorati's top lists and looked for properly formatted feeds.<p>- The layout is not yet optimized for touch devices at all. Apologies. I hope I'll find the time to work on it soon...<p>- I decided to use Meebo because their sharing function does a good job.

1458909,comment,1458178,1458551,0,0,tom_b,,,"I think it <i>could</i> make a difference.<p>As a long time hacker (and BS/MS of CS degree holder), I think there are tremendous academic/""real world"" disconnects between understanding the paradigms of programming languages, choosing appropriate implementation languages for projects, and the fact that programming language is often chosen for you (because of platform reasons or ""popularity"" in the SW engineering labor pool, e.g. Java, C#, or others because of management perceptions of skillset availability in the programmer market).  Heck, I struggle getting my group to allow us to <i>write</i> new software instead of using unsatisfactory existing frameworks and solutions.  Forget about pushing the envelop by saying something crazy, like maybe Ruby/Sinatra would be a good choice for this CRUD app . . .<p>I suspect, but cannot prove, that a proper programming languages class would improve a hacker's ability to know and choose the right tool to attack a problem.  My own experience with, of all things, SQL, has led me to be much more productive/effective in producing software that works when measured against lines of code written.  But frankly, I think that it is going to be hard to get the kind of deep exposure you need in a different programming paradigm in a one semester course as an undergrad to make much difference here - it was only after spending months of time in the deeper pool of db programming, that I wrapped my head around actually thinking differently about problems.<p>The simpler truth is that there seem to be a number of bright programmers who can write the vast majority of standard corporate software with a less than optimal language/platform choice.  Sure, maybe it would have been faster or more expressive to have used J to solve a particular problem, but if somebody hacked the solution out in C#, the end-users of the software don't care at all.<p>I think you are correct that most of the academic world vastly overestimates how much choice is available at most software shops to chose the ""right tool for the problem.""<p>I do like the CTM book by Peter Van Roy mentioned in the article very much - it is not a book that I used as an undergrad or grad student, but I have been skimming it and like very much how it is laid out and has a single language/env where it implements different programming paradigms.<p>What I wish I was personally better at would be having a small set of languages, easily available and justifiable to non-technical decision makers that I <i>knew</i> would make my team more productive.  Sort of a ""problem patterns"" knowledge that you would automatically think ""aha, language X is often used for this type of problem space"" that was taught.  But you'd need someone in a programming languages course with a deeper exposure to industry computing to pull it off as an instructor . . .<p>But I think the key benefit might simply be breaking the hacker's mind from thinking OO and procedural only . . . if people don't learn functional and declarative programming, how can they begin to fathom the situations where it's exactly the right way to conceptualize a solution?",1277408546

Funny as hell, too.<p>It's amazing to me how thoroughly old guard biz types (especially the kind you find haunting the halls of print media conglomerates, not that that's relevant here) cling to outdated traditions like resumes. At this point I generally don't even bother sending a resume when applying for work unless it's explicitly demanded and can't remember the last time I updated mine. The last two jobs I took where picked up on the strength of my open source contributions (look Ma, real code!) and a small developer blog that I maintain. Resumes? For developers? Seriously?",1277406352

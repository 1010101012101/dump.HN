What, is it made of diamonds?<p>My current phone is AT&T's $10 Go Phone (some kind of LG), and it has a color screen, customizable menus, and better voice quality than my previous phone (an LG flip phone).  It's also light, small and has decent battery life.<p>Of course, I'm just waiting till I'm eligible for an upgrade so I can get an iPhone . . .",1207058387
151996,comment,151637,151728,0,0,kmt,,,"Does this mean that nowadays you can expect emacs to be installed on every system?  From what I've seen, still no.  So basic vi skills are still needed.  But nowadays, there are many ways to avoid having to edit files with vi.  If a system has sftp access you can mount it's file system via sshfs and edit files from your main machine in emacs.  This way you could even have the files version controlled on your main machine.  There's also tramp mode of course, but sshfs works better.",1207058334

151994,comment,151980,151980,0,0,edw519,,,"Client's print server crashed in the middle of the night.  Month end accounting batch (written by idiots) updated databases before encountering dead end at printing.  Accounting wants their reports, but there aren't any.  Can't restore because sales & fulfillment have already done many database updates before I was called.  Not sure what to do.<p>Today I was going to add a few features to my web app.  Instead, I guess I'll be changing 20 year old programs to not update databases, but print reports.  I think.  Not sure.<p>So I thought I would just have a cup of Columbian Supreme, a donut, and a quick visit here.  Makes about as much sense as anything else.<p>(If only this were an April Fools joke.)",1207058165

151990,comment,151637,151637,0,0,ten-seven,,,"Back when I was coding a lot, there were two editors, vi and one other that came with the Unix variant we had. The other ""visual"" editor had an annoying tendency to convert multiple spaces to tabs if it was able to. This broke formatting and messed up make files. It sparked a holy war against those who ""maintained"" code with that editor, calling for those people to use vi and stop breaking things.",1207058039

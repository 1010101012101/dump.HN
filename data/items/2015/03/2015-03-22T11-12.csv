9246441,comment,9245361,9245361,0,0,disjointrevelry,,,"It depends on a lot of factors, but mostly what you take with you out of college and into the real world. Elite colleges  place virtual restrictions in order to create some community that they consider &#x27;elite&#x27;, and its strength in elitism is also its major drawback, being they are not representative of the world.<p>edit:
Even if we take cold simple numbers of &quot;1 in 10&quot; acceptance rate, we can see it is not all that it is cut out to be. One student in the elite college is not &quot;worth&quot; replacing the other &quot;9&quot;. Just attribution to an elite college simply does not mean given 9 of the others, that they can somehow be &#x27;replaced&#x27; by that one who met a minute ephemeral elitist criterion. Nor does it mean they work harder, or that they are more appropriate for any given situation or requirement, or that they would benefit any organization significantly by the same factor or anywhere near it given the other 9.<p>Elite colleges are more like brand names than anything else and they need that image of low/high quality and superior distance in ability to sell their highly priced packages. The substance may not even actually be there, other than as a perception and preconceived notion.<p>tld;r I agree that the attribution of the significance of acceptance into elite colleges is way overblown. Most of it is without substance, but maybe just driven by social status for inclusion into the top 1% of America&#x27;s elite that rule the US.",1427025501

Those have increased faster than the growth rate of the economy because interest rates have been trending down for 30+ years.<p>That being said, we&#x27;ve reached the end of that trade--mostly because interest rates don&#x27;t have anywhere else to go but up.

After all, rising prices is why foreigners own these assets in the first place.<p>- Stop foreign ownership of more than 50% of a building. That way, projects still get funded and locals get housing.<p>- Increase stamp duty taxes on foreigners purchasing homes<p>- Use the money you gain in tax revenue to fund cheaper real estate building for locals<p>- Any other real estate can only be bought by foreigners if they are locally resident in BC for a year or more<p>What is really outstanding with all of this though is that Canadians cannot own property in Hong Kong (lease only, lots of Government owned real estate) and cannot own property in the PRC without meeting residency requirements.

They are confused about the precisely defined, widely understood meaning of words, and they already actively misunderstand the English language, as well as the Java language specification.<p>If I drove your grandmother BY a car, it would be totally different than driving her AS a car (logically: if your grandmother had wheels, then she&#x27;d be a car).

It won&#x27;t give any minority an inch more rights so they could tyrannize the majority.<p>> How does &quot;emergence&quot; affect the possibility of tyranny?<p>A lot, because of human empathy. Why would you vote for a tyranny of relatively small group of people? Most people can see that one step ahead and know that they are the next. Also, in more direct democracies, people vote more often and have different views on issues, so they are minority and majority at the same time. This influences their willingness to compromise.<p>> So maybe the takeaway here is that pure democracy is insufficient?<p>It is insufficient, but not in the general sense &quot;because of tyranny of the majority&quot;. Democracy doesn&#x27;t try to solve specific cultural issues, it&#x27;s a decision making mechanism. If your objection is just a general &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;, then I doubt there is anything better (because you have to start somewhere, and democracy gives everyone the same power).<p>> Isn&#x27;t this just semantics?<p>No. There are different methods how to have same access to power. All of them can be considered democratic, although each has advantages and disadvantages. Also, to prevent Russell-style paradoxes, you cannot decide democratically whether or not you want to abandon (or establish) democracy. You can however decide that with a vote.<p>> Freedom to vote doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to mean freedom to persecute--freedoms generally end at the boundary where they begin trampling other freedoms.<p>I think you misunderstand the sentence - I meant that people that are being persecuted can still have voting rights. Although historically, I would say any group with voting rights was being persecuted much less than without.<p>> Also, in which situations &quot;It is a cultural issue&quot;?<p>What I mean is that it&#x27;s not just legal framework that causes oppression, people&#x27;s beliefs cause oppression. The laws are, and always will be, reflection of those beliefs. If you don&#x27;t like that someone is being persecuted, you can&#x27;t just change the law, you have to change the culture.<p>> Do current elites participate in persecutions?<p>Depends on who you ask, what your specific persecution you have in mind. But in most cases it&#x27;s just sitting by idly, whether or not it&#x27;s participation again depends on your view.<p>> How will people in prison obtain fair representation under DemocracyOS?<p>I wasn&#x27;t addressing DemocracyOS specifically, but in my country (Czech Republic), we have provisions for prisoners to vote if they want to. So in our country they have fairer representation than in the U.S. (at least some states).<p>> So the solution is to never protect minorities in the first place?<p>I am not sure what &quot;protections&quot; you have in mind. As I already explained, it&#x27;s hard to conceive that e.g. Saudi Arabian elites would decide to protect women minority. It&#x27;s a matter of culture and you cannot rely on any elite (even appointed one) to do that. Society as a whole has to believe that&#x27;s a good value.<p>And as far as general protections go, I can&#x27;t imagine anything better than democracy, which just gives everyone same rights. Any other solution will <i>by definition</i> have to give someone more say, and this person or group will be more fallible and can cause more oppression themselves.",1427023287

  Depends on your terminology.  But it&#x27;s kinda both.  It&#x27;s pass-by-value for
  everything, with the twist that for class instances, the thing that&#x27;s 
  passed-by-value is the pointer to the object, so it behaves like 
  pass-by-reference.

  Reminds me of the controversy about Niklaus Wirth&#x27;s name:

  &quot;Whereas Europeans generally pronounce his name the right way
  (&#x27;Nick-louse Veert&#x27;), Americans invariably mangle it into &#x27;Nickel&#x27;s
  Worth.&#x27; This is to say that Europeans call him by name, but Americans
  call him by value.&quot; - Introduction by Adriaan van Wijngaarden at the
  IFIP Congress (1965).

  It seems to be a consequence of pretending pointers don&#x27;t exist -- you
  also have to pretend you have variables with object values and
  references, but you still can&#x27;t write a swap(a, b) function. If you
  think of Java object values as pointers, then it&#x27;s obviously passing
  references by value. But if you don&#x27;t believe in pointers and think of
  variables as containing objects, then it&#x27;s obviously passing objects
  by reference, but your view of the world is an illusion, because it&#x27;s
  really implemented with pointers.

  Or is it??? Someone suggested a Magic Elves theory, which helps a lot
  of other stuff to make more sense.

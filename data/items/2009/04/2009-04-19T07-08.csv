The author is absolutely confusing ""what exists"" with ""what is readily made commercially available to the public"". A few hours of browsing tech blogs would make it very clear how many significant advances are made. He talks about Blu-Ray like it's cutting edge. Meanwhile we have companies putting out 3D TV sets <i>this year</i>. Digital cameras really can't get any better? Last time I checked, there still aren't any small, inexpensive consumer 3D data acquisition devices yet. And the jump from dial-up to broadband is no bigger than the jump from our anemic 6-8MB connections to the 1GB/s service that Korea is building out as we speak.<p>The title of this should really be, ""Why don't people realize that our tech still sucks?""",1240126787

569220,comment,568976,569031,0,0,derefr,,,"In fact, you can go further: don't try to turn an already-created app into a game. Instead, when you're first working on a business concept, make sure that you <i>create a game</i> first and foremost, and then try to figure out how to let the user do some interesting thing (whatever your original app would otherwise be about) as a <i>side-effect</i> of play. This is how Flickr got off the ground: first it was just an MMO, and then people possessed and traded photos within the MMO, and then that started to become more and more the focus. It's still a game at heart—just like Reddit and, to some extent, Hacker News itself are—it's just shifted to achievement by means of photos, rather than whatever else it had people do before, because that's what interested them.<p>Let me clarify, though, what I mean by ""game."" There's this idea in pen-and-paper RPG game design called the <i>threefold model</i>. Basically, it states that there are three reasons people immerse themselves into a virtual, social world constrained by rules (a ""game"".) It's usually phrased, though, that there are three archetypical players, one to purely seek each goal, of which any individual may be a varied mixture.<p>1. There are Simulationists, who want to explore the ""reality"" of the world itself.<p>2. There are Narrativists, who want to feel that they're part of an overarching story, and that both themselves, and the world, are important and have purpose.<p>3. There are Gamists, who want to compete for resources, usually against the other players or the game's universe itself.<p>This model is useful for more than pen-and-paper RPGs, obviously; the three motivations people have for playing games are the same as the three motivations people have for doing <i>anything</i>, once they've sated their base urges: <i>satisfying curiosity</i> and feeling <i>in control of the world</i> (Simulationism), finding <i>a sense of purpose</i> (Narrativism), and <i>feeling powerful</i> and <i>having control of the other players</i> (Gamism). Whenever you're helping people to achieve one or more of those three goals, the means by which you're doing so can probably be classified as a game: D&D, Facebook, the Stock Market, Religion, etc.",1240126498

569214,comment,569122,569122,0,0,10ren,,,"The main thing is to be aware that there is a whole reality out there that you don't know <i>and nobody else does either</i>. If you can crack it, you can have great success.<p>Cracking it takes alertness and endurance more than raw intelligence, because inspiration comes from new data - not from solving a pedagogically designed problem. New data is, by definition, not known beforehand. You get new data (that no one else has) by looking, by being there and doing the work, and noticing interesting opportunities.<p>In a way, marketing is more aware of this <i>unknown</i> that science, because it changes more quickly for marketing (and no one believes a marketing success represents the fundamental underlying truth of reality). That is, marketing says ""what do people want?"" I think it's this, you think it's that. Let's ask some people - but they don't know either until they see it. OK, so let's <i>invent the future</i>, and see if anyone likes it once they see it. But underlying is the conviction that <i>we don't know</i>. For a Science, computer science is full of dogma and religion (it even has ""religious"" wars). Oh well, paradigms are inevitable I guess.<p>I like paul graham's definition of business, ""build something people want"" = new product development + marketing.<p>A tech degree teaches you some theory about ""build something"" (and not the practice of source control, testing, deployment, usability etc); but it teaches nothing about ""people want"", which is basically looking from the user's point of view.<p>I don't think there's any silver bullet that would help my younger self overcome the vampires (to maintain the metaphor). I believe that marketing is the key skill, which I define as making something that is potentially useful to people, and then bringing about the state of affairs where it is actually being useful to many people each day.<p>There are all kinds of entrepreneurial ventures; mainstream ones are popular at the moment, which Y-Com advocates (or appears to); but there are also highly technical ventures in the general category. For me, a deeper grasp of discrete mathematics might have been useful (but it's never been intuitive for me, and I note that the people for whom it is intuitive seem to lose their connection with what is usable for ordinary people - I welcome counter-examples to this point). I'd also like a deeper grasp of parsing theory (but much of parsing theory seems inappropriate for the way I want to use it - so maybe it's best to appreciate the state-of-the-art, without drinking its koolaid).<p>For me (very personally), it's crucial to (a) be able to build something; (b) to notice that a problem can be solved fundamentally better (and see how to solve it); (c) to be able to communicate the solution in terms of what some people need.<p><i>Disclaimer</i>: As you'll have sensed, this is a personal philosophy rather than ordinary business practice. Many, <i>many</i> successful businesses have no need of this focus on the unknown. But this is the basis of many huge, cool, revolutionary, ""disruptive"" businesses.<p>The one thing I wish I'd learnt (it's more an attitude than a skill):
avoid premature optimization <i>including usability</i>. Usability is extremely important; it's second only to <i>understanding what you are doing</i>. Keep things simple, even at the expense of usability. Don't add special cases that make it easier to use (not yet). If you let it get complex, you might still just understand it in isolation, but as it combines with other complexities, sooner or later you won't. This goes for a business as a whole, as well as for a computer system.",1240125904

Looking at the effect on science and knowledge as a whole, however, the observer-expectancy effect is quite damaging and is not a mystery at all.<p>This team (and many other teams) of unfortunate researchers got caught up in a belief system that skewed their results.

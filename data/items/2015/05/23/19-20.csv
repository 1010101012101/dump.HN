Most people&#x27;s go-to seems to be to try to keep the rent low, but that doesn&#x27;t really accomplish anything but keeping the same people in the same slightly less grinding poverty for the rest of their lives. What if you raised the rent like they say, but put some of the money towards some kind of education or life-counseling class on-premises instead of just pocketing it all?<p>I thought of that when I remembered a recent discussion on debt collectors where one collector decided that, instead of just hounding and threatening the debtors with dire consequences, they would actually help them make more money to pay the debits by giving them career counseling, resume help, interview practice, help finding jobs they could do, etc. You get your money and improve their lives at the same time.<p>Why not try the same thing here? I bet a lot of the people there could be making more money if there was somebody there to teach them things, train them in new skills, help them out with logistics, transportation, contacts, etc. Why not dream up new ways to help them instead of new ways to fuck them over?",1432411194

He also talks about US policies which are causing problems outside the US, motivating people to move here in the first place.<p>So far its a compassionate treatment of the subject. He doesn&#x27;t favor border control, and does favor amnesty to those here already.<p>It seems hard to talk about societies problems without talking about overpopulation.",1432411160

9594152,comment,9592574,9593927,0,0,HillRat,,,"Well, Tet showed that the USG had either consistently lied or was consistently misinformed about the actual strength of the North Vietnamese forces, so it shook public confidence in Washington; the US casualties were far higher than confident military forecasts; and the American public found the US airpower tactics horrifying and the wanton brutality of ARVN &quot;allies&quot; reprehensible. (North Vietnamese forces were no less brutal, they just didn&#x27;t have embedded reporters in their units.)<p>In many ways, the Tet Offensive just reinforced the lessons of Ia Drang, from half a decade prior: US forces could use vertical envelopment, precision artillery and CAS to do a hell of a number on North Vietnamese units (though I Corps was almost completely cut off logistically by NVA activity, forcing a major airlift to keep operations going); but the Viet Cong/NLF forces could, operating autonomously in the countryside and even in cities (as seen by the NLF siege of the Saigon AMEMB), still inflict significant casualties on US forces by using ambushes, traps and rush-to-close engagement tactics to neutralize US technology.<p>Arguably, had the US &quot;held the line&quot; instead of engaging in theatre force reductions, then perhaps the North Vietnamese threat could have been contained, and perhaps even rolled back -- but at the cost of decades of combat, massive American casualties, the utter desolation of most of Vietnam, and domestic unrest in CONUS. And, even then, the ineffective, delegitmized and corrupt South Vietnamese military and government would have faced decades more of revolutionary violence that it was unequipped to face militarily, socially or politically. Saigon had as good a chance of long-term survival as Rhodesia or French Algeria did, and the US was simply wasting youth and treasure trying to keep the Communists out.",1432411146

9594140,comment,9593916,9593916,0,0,cperciva,,,"Since this is heading towards the top of HN, I figure it&#x27;s worth responding to the specifics here:<p><i>AES-GCM</i><p>As tptacek says, this has pitfalls on some platforms.  I also dislike exposing AES cores to malicious data, which is my primary reason for preferring a hash-based MAC construction.<p><i>Avoid: key sizes under 128 bits.</i><p>My recommendation for 256-bit symmetric keys isn&#x27;t because I think AES-128 can be broken mathematically; rather, it&#x27;s because AES implementations have a history of leaking some of their key bits via side channels.  This is less of an issue now than it was five years ago (implementors have found and closed some side channels, and hardware AES implementations theoretically shouldn&#x27;t have any) but given the history of leaking key bits I&#x27;d prefer to have a few to spare.<p><i>Avoid: userspace random number generators</i><p>Thomas and I have argued about this at length; suffice to say that, as someone who has seen interesting misbehaviours from kernel RNGs I&#x27;d prefer to use them for seeding and then generate further bits from a uesrspace RNG.  (Thomas&#x27;s counterargument, which has some validity, is that he has seen interesting misbehaviours from userspace RNGs.  This largely comes down to a question of whether you think the person writing your userland crypto code is more or less prone to making mistakes than the average kernel developer.)<p><i>avoid RSA</i><p>Thomas is correct to imply that a random RSA implementation is more likely to be broken than an average elliptic curve implementation.  This is true for the same reason as a random program written in python is more likely to have bugs than a random program written in Brainfuck: Inexperienced developers usually don&#x27;t  even try hard problems.  On the other hand, <i>for any particular developer</i>, an RSA implementation they write is more likely to be correct than an elliptic curve implementation they write.<p>I also continue to be wary of mathematical breakthroughs concerning elliptic curves.  Depending on the amount of new research we see in the next few years I might be comfortable recommending ECC some time between 2020 and 2025.<p><i>use NaCl</i><p>This is not entirely a bad idea.  The question of &quot;implement yourself or use existing libraries&quot; comes down to the availability of libraries and whether the authors of the library are more or less prone to making errors than you; &quot;random developer vs. NaCl developers&quot; is straightforward and doesn&#x27;t have the same answer as &quot;random developer vs. OpenSSL developers&quot;.<p><i>you discover that you made a mistake and your protocol had virtually no security. That happened to Colin</i><p>Just to clarify this, the (very embarrassing) bug Thomas is referring to was in the at-rest crypto, not the encrypted client-server transport layer.<p><i>Online backups (Was: Use Tarsnap): Remains Tarsnap.  What can I say? This recommendation stood the test of time.</i><p>I have to agree with Thomas on this one. ;-)",1432411025

So,\nfor some arithmetic<p><pre><code>     50 * 10**6 / 100,000 = 500\n</code></pre>\nSo, distributing the CEO&#x27;s salary among\nall the low level workers would\ngive each worker only about $500\nmore a year, that is, about the\nsame as working one week.  Wouldn&#x27;t\neven start to put the worker in\nthe middle class.<p>Might argue that if the CEO does\nhis/her job well, then the company\nwill grow, hire another 50,000,\ncurrently nearly unemployed,\nlow wage workers and promote some of the\npresent 100,000 workers to management\npositions where they start to get into\nthe middle class.<p>Net, to get the poor people into the\nmiddle class will take more money\nthan the CEOs get, and one of the\nbest approaches is to have more and\nbetter CEOs who create more and better\njobs.  One example may be the\nlarge company (?) that recently\nannounced that all its employees,\nmany at the low level, \ncan go to college for free.<p>Again, it appears that the key to\ngetting the poor people into the\nmiddle class is not rich people\nbut powerful people, yes, maybe\npowerful because they are rich;\nbut to be successful they need\nto use their power, and smarts,\nand not just their money --\nbecause even the rich people\ndo not have even 1% of the needed money.<p>Power?

I also use a couple of cloud dev environments (nitrous.io and codeanywhere) and of course just straight up ssh into a server if I feel like it.<p>I tend to work in any of ruby, python, c#, go, php, general front end javascript, html, css and lots of database stuff - so essentially various forms of web dev.

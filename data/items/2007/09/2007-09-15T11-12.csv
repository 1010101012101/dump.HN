1X no authentication of sender. One of the most problematic consequence is that reporting errors to senders had to be disabled. smtp protocol, in its most common usage form, is broken. Relying on DNS to authenticate (DKIM) is just moving the problem to depend on DNS which is also weak from the security perspective. <p>2X the need for one to be contactable by anybody. This requires to open a door for incoming info which will be exploited by spammers. This is an old problem that managers are facing for years. The role of spam filter was hold by the secretary (human filtering phone calls, visits). <p>The problem 1 is a technical problem and it is a shame it has not been solved yet. Problem 2 is the real root of spamming. There are various ways to address problem 2. This is one of the business model I'm currently investigating.",1189856091

It's an interesting factoid, but falls far short of implying causality. I could make another Depeche Mode reference here, but it would be <i>extremely</i> tasteless.<p>When Greenspan and his ilk characterize people as 'parasites', I parse that as 'anyone who gets between me and the forests of money to which I am entitled'. I might see where he's coming from, but his rhetoric is needlessly violent.",1189854102

11422,comment,11422,9770,0,0,dave59,,,"I went to one of Microsoft's rollout conferences recently -- to get a free copy of Office. The new Word really is better than the old Word, and--call me grandma--I still like it--I'm used to it. I sat at a big table eating lunch with my fellow small business types who came for the same thing, and listened to the MS power users talk about looking around and seeing, and realizing how old they, and the rest of the loyalists were. True. The loyal MS IT guys were there in force, to applaud Bill warmly.  But it wasn't a big under-thirty audience.  The presenters all talked about the many new enterprise features of Vista and the servers, the tightest possible integration of everything a huge organization needs to control every detail of work. And how much they hate pocket flash drives -- those enemies of corporate security. And all of us Office freeloaders smiled and nodded, and ate their sandwiches.\n",1176230849

I didn't get my first computer until I was 10 (1991), and didn't start using e-mail regularly until 1996 or so.  Was an early adopter for the web though; first encountered it in 1993, using Lynx, and also used Mosaic and Netscape 1.0 in 1995.<p>I think that the technologies you end up being an early-adopter of is mostly determined by luck, who your friends are.

I meant that GNU/Linux has simple but powerful IDEs like vim built-in, and most distributions come with gcc as well for compiling the basic languages.  There are higher-level programming languages included in the installation like Perl, Python, Java, and more.  If you want to install new ones, it's simple, just type ""emerge ruby sbcl ocaml ..."".<p>I didn't intend my comment to mean that Windows doesn't have legitimate hackers, I was just saying that it doesn't support them nearly as well as others do, with its closed API and licensed software-building tools.  I was also poking fun at the ""MILLIONS of hackers"" comment, because in my opinion, there aren't millions of hackers in the entire world.  I don't believe that hacker simply means ""programmer"", but rather, something a bit more.  I certainly wouldn't consider myself to be one yet, even though I am quite confident in my programming skills.<p>So I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that there aren't Windows hackers, just that I seriously doubt that there are millions of them.",1176229658

11398,comment,10967,11020,0,0,patryn20,,,"Memcache your dictionary if you can. Or dump it into a MySQL heap table. That will speed it up a lot.<p>Seriously, though, looping through the dictionary is really a bad solution. Maybe reading the dictionary into an associative array and matching on index or something like that would be a better idea for speed. Loop through words in the post instead of words in the dictionary.<p>The major limitation here is that it requires a word to be in the dictionary to be considered correct. Non-optimal. No pluralization handling (other than brute forcing by adding to the dictionary), no possessive case (as was noted in the code), and no new-line handling (hint: simply strip all newlines from input, replace with a space, and be done with it. Check for hypens before a new-line to detect continued words; though, that is unlikely in a web post. Just don't use the output directly into a post. Maintain a control copy.)<p>Also, I can't download the source directly (file not found). I had to edit the URL to make it work.

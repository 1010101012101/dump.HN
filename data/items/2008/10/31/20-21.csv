If its not found to be useful or inventive then it's not patentable.<p>Inherently most vehicles are non-patentable as they all serve an identical purpose and relatively few are at all inventive.<p>Quite simply a patent can be invalidated by someone simply inventing it themselves, which turns something from 'original' to 'obvious' and thus non-patentable.<p>Vehicle patents are very complicated to enforce, namely because if anyone ever tries to enforce one they can actually end up getting it invalidated (which in patent law, abolition happens more than enforcement).

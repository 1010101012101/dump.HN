I realize you did, but then again there are people in American schools that also like math.  How many, really?<p>2.  How much of that math that everyone has to learn is actually useful for the average person?<p>3.  You say ""Forget about the whole, um, personality and uniqueness and whatnots."" -- This is basically the approach that has been taken throughout most of history, grounded in the idea that we're all empty cups to be filled.  However, the ""empty cups to be filled"" idea is flawed.  It's true that in America people hate to be called the same, enjoy their uniqueness, etc. -- however that idea is more than just a skin-deep preference.  Young people are different, have different hobbies, different values, personalities, and have different ways of learning.  One can apply one method and ignore all that (ie. your prescription), or another is to realize that differences do exist and structure the learning environment to cater for it.  The former is a proven way of producing decent outcomes (though very varied); the latter is in many respects unproven/unsolved, and so I believe has much greater potential.  Just as HN'ers pursue innovation through technology (in most cases), the latter pursues innovation with learning outcomes.",1344894481

If you're always viewing lots of chicken recipes, I an make the assumption you're a fan of chicken. I can also note that the recipes that you view and like are ""upper class"", requiring expensive ingredients.<p>Now an advertiser for a large Chicken producer could come to me, and want to advertise its new Free Range chickens. They (the advertiser) asks me to display an ad for all people who like chickens and like expensive tastes. So I (the site owner) do this, and you (a user) see the ad.<p>At no point has the advertiser learnt anything about my users, or had any direct knowledge of my users and their preferences. It's a completely one-way transaction.<p>So if I was writing a recipe website and I wanted to fund it with advertising, that's how I'd do it. I'd probably give some kind of iTunes dynamic playlist / email filter style UI where you get to pick the types of people your ad gets seen by, but at no point would the advertiser actually learn anything about those people.<p>Is this still considered ""selling your personal details""? Or are companies like Facebook and (presumably) Twitter actually essentially handing over their DBs?",1344894428

There exists a decently competitive market with 4 main companies, but the standard 2-year contract lock-in means all the competition happens mostly at customer acquisition where you see big deals on discount phones. But after the customer is locked-in they operate more like monopolies with hidden charges and poor service.<p>As for social networks, the network-effect lock-in is a huge impediment to good market competition. Once someone has their social network in place it makes it very difficult to switch.

Using the examples from passmix.com with base 'house cat' I might end up with: 'housei!n8cat' and 'housek!e6cat'. Say I'm targeting you specifically, I look at these two passwords, and I see that they both follow 'houseX!Y#cat' format.

I haven't yet heard back from them yet, but it's probably a slow process.<p>I don't like that they'd automatically opt me into displaying what I read. That ruins any sense of privacy I have to browse the site (ignoring the cynical and probably accurate view that I had no privacy there to start). Were I curious about something but didn't want it shared with the world, Quora is a dead end. I can opt out, but if this is their idea of the future, they may remove the option.<p>In the meantime, I tried deleting most of my answers, though Quora doesn't really do so. Instead, changes are kept in a list of edits, which allows you to revert the change. I like that, it's handy, but I can't remove my edit history. My hope is that the changes are lost once the account is deleted, though I doubt they will.<p>I also dislike that deleting my account, including all data associated with it, requires I e-mail them. It seems absurd to do all this work for your users and provide them no way to easily walk out if they're unhappy with site changes (as I am). If I own the content I publish on Quora, as they claim, then I should be able to completely delete it.<p>At best, it's a way to prevent accidental account loss. At worst, it's a slimy method of ensuring the service holds onto user-provided data. Sadly, the only site to allow me to delete my account without sending an email thus far was Facebook[1] -- though I'm sure they've held onto a great deal of my junk nonetheless.

Yes, it's lovely if you're Patrick or Thomas and in B2B world where you can whack up your prices and hope whoever is paying the bill isn't spending their own money.<p>Newsflash: If you're dealing with a bootstrapped business, it might well be that the person paying the bill <i>is</i> spending their own money.<p>Newsflash #2: There are <i>dozens</i> of companies pitching useful-but-not-that-useful tools and services to these bootstrapped businesses. If you spend $100/month on this one, and $300 over there, and $150 on the next one, and ten more after that, and then you multiply it by 12... Well, before long you're spending on the same kind of level that it takes to hire some office help or to run a long-term marketing campaign with a significant level of funding or for that matter to hire in a guy who knows what he's doing for a few days to build your own customised versions of a lot of these services.<p>In short, if you think the ability to monitor a couple of production servers is worth $1,000+/year to a bootstrapped company, you're crazy. Yes, it's a convenience, but you're talking about a service that could be built using a couple of widely available building blocks with a tiny fraction of the running costs, and frankly to a business at that stage in its development it is highly unlikely that a server falling over until the morning is going to cause any real long-term damage anyway.<p>When you're dealing with relatively time-rich and cash-poor early stage businesses (OK, time-poor as well because they're trying to build the business, but that's not really the point here) you can't just dismiss the cumulative effect of all these SaaS gadgets. They add up, and if you want to know why so many small businesses fail, I expect not controlling costs is probably somewhere around #2 or #3 on the list.<p>Does that mean bootstrapped companies are bad customers for these kinds of services?

At the time I was writing everything in C and having the flexibility without the pain of C that PERL provided was such a great gift.  I wrote literally 100,000's of lines of PERL (one project alone was 25k LOC) and enjoyed it all the way up until maybe 1993!<p>CPAN is hard to beat, having modules that work, etc.  But I won't defend PERL because the reality is I almost never use it anymore.  Not because there is something wrong with it, just because more often I run into problem sets that either require me to return to C (Think 45,000 QPS under 4 ms response time) and/or web stuff my dev team is more comfortable with on PhP.<p>PERL transformed my life and my thinking.  It taught me that ""Just because you CAN do something a particular way doesn't mean that you SHOULD do it that way."".. I took this much further then PERL and learned to apply it to all my projects and started writing in the ""right language for the problem set"".  Instead of trying to fit every problem to the handful of languages I could program at that time.<p>Now I write in so many languages and utilize so many platforms and systems that the concept is just part of who I am when I am presented with a new problem to solve.

This is not even irrational, considering the precedent set by Facebook - not only doing the same kind of awful stuff over and over again, but actually maintaining that nobody should have privacy. And Facebook has thousands of full-time defenders.<p>Apparently you (like a lot of savvy people otherwise concerned with privacy) will tolerate it from Facebook but not from Quora. So I guess what Quora should do is just get bought by Facebook; then you will not (be able to?) complain about their sketchy behavior.",1344891907

4378146,comment,4377535,4378100,14,0,ghshephard,,,"I disagree with you - but I'm not downvoting you because I think you bring up an interesting point.  The problem, though, is the advertising on buy.com, monoprice.com, amazon.com and even google.com is actually quite useful for me.  Sometimes even the ads on dpreview.com are interesting.  The issue here is intent - on these sites, I am looking to buy products, product reviews, or (in the case of google) searching for something that might be product related.<p>On my social networks (Path) - my intent is to see what my niece is up to, what my friends are doing, and what my mother's latest project is.<p>It is not (and never has been) to ""Find a Female Friend in Redwood City"", or, ""Check out the Kmart Special"".<p>It is this disconnect between intent and ad-presentation that makes the pollution of the twitter feed so offensive.",1344891827

So, pretty much all is still lost if someone is able to break into Clipperz and modify the javascript without being noticed for a while.<p>A possible solution to <i>that</i> is to implement a browser extension to hash the javascript (and perhaps display it as a visual hash) so the user can at least easily check whether it's changed.

If you don't have the resources to fact-check something (because you've laid off so many people), and other sites (like macrumors.com) do, then you should leave that story alone and let others fact-check it. I'm tired of every major news site trying to be all things to all people. We have aggregators now, so only a few sites need to cover any one thing, and people will still find out about it.<p>I've only partially thought through this argument, so I'm sure it has all sorts of holes and will be easy to misinterpret in every way possible, but I'm throwing it out there anyways.",1344891786

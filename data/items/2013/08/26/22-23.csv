With a median household income of approx $50k [3], then we assume that approx. $2.5k is the average amount an average USA household can afford each year. With average savings of around $6k [3], that&#x27;s over 5 1/2 years to &quot;get out from under&quot;, not including loss of earning, no savings cushion, and not including interest payments.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2013/02/14/used-car-prices-stay-high-heres-where-to-find-the-best-deals/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2013/02/14/used-car...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/23113/how-many-weeks-of-living-expenses-does-the-average-american-have-savings-for"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/23113/how-many-week...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_...</a>",1377557983

6280462,comment,6279162,6279162,16,0,Amadou,,,"It seems my take away from the article was a lot different from most of you.<p>What I read was a discussion of how coddling is crippling.  That the parents who were financially capable of insulating their children from pretty much any sort of failure were actually setting their children up for failure when it matters most.<p>It is reasonable to contrast that attitude with the failure-embracing aspect of startup culture.  That here there is no stigma associated with a startup failing, it is seen as a learning experience.  The idea that falling down is part of the process of learning to run is completely at odds with the attitude of the parents in the article.",1377557958
6280461,comment,6279241,6280272,1,0,eevee,,,"Ah, sorry, some actual context might be helpful.<p>In Perl, variable declaration was originally even worse than it is in PHP: any variable, anywhere, required no declaration and was assumed to be a <i>global</i>.  (This was inherited from...  some combination of awk and shell, I guess.)  Obvious problems aside, a practical implication was that recursion was pretty awkward, since the callee and the caller were sharing the same namespace for the same code.<p>Perl 5.000 introduced the `my` function, which would declare a variable as lexically scoped.  This solved the practical issues, but it left the problem of error-checking: a typo in a variable name would still create an implicit global with no warning.  The solution was the opt-in `use strict;` declaration, which <i>disabled</i> the implicit-global behavior and made unrecognized variable names a compile-time error.  Code could be fixed and then opt into the stricter semantics on a per-file (or even per-block!) basis, and nowadays most Perl devs will jump on you like a pack of hyenas if your code doesn&#x27;t start with `use strict;` or some equivalent.  Over time other features with too-sharp edges have been culled, still supported by the interpreter (Perl is more or less compatible going back <i>decades</i>) but made illegal in strict mode.<p>JavaScript&#x27;s weird &quot;use strict&quot; opt-in is a spiritual port of Perl&#x27;s approach, stuffed into a string literal to fit into the existing syntax.  One of its effects is even the same: assigning to an unrecognized name is now illegal, rather than creating an implicit global.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of anything so fundamental being changed in such a heavy-handed way in PHP.  From the outside looking in, I&#x27;m not even sure the PHP community has a strong consensus on what PHP-specific features to avoid.  I&#x27;d be happy to learn that I&#x27;m wrong on either count.",1377557956

The above statement is undoubtedly true, but that doesn&#x27;t mean what I said is false.<p>The problem, is, as you say, that the Incans only had access to cloth armor, copper axes, and stone clubs, as I said in my comment. They eventually developed guerilla tactics, but such tactics are not effective when you are sieging your capital,  trying to take it back from invaders. Also, I cordially invite you to try and organize the digging of ditches when 50 to 90 percent of your population has been killed, most of the rest are in rebellion because your rule was, frankly, never terribly popular, and the remaining percentage are currently facing down a thousand pound warhorse. I would also like to point out that decently training a pole-armsmen is no easy feat when you have never done it before, and your empire is in disarray.<p>Also, the Spanish had plenty of experience in the European style of warfare based on cavalry supported by foot, since the European cultures had access to horses for many centuries at this point, whereas the Incans and other cultures and empires that arose in the Andes had access to the llama.

6280360,comment,6273692,6277715,1,0,FreeFull,,,"Sorry for the long rant ahead.<p>This is anecdotal, but I find that in general a static, strongly typed language actually helps me when I am writing the program. One quarter of the time, I find that the code I just wrote doesn&#x27;t make sense and end up having a conversation with the compiler and REPL until it works.<p>One important place where I find types help me is error handling. I typically prefer to have Maybe/Option, Either, or similar types for normal errors, and to have exceptions reserved for when the program enters an unrecoverable state and needs to crash.<p>There are also cases where a dynamically typed language will error during runtime, and where a statically typed language would have instead errored during compile time. It is possible to encode invariants into types, for example to force all red-black trees to be balanced.<p>I haven&#x27;t found a case yet where such an error wasn&#x27;t due to flawed reasoning on my part, and depending on the language implementation it is possible to optionally defer type errors to runtime. The language I tend to use the most also has an escape hatch to allow dynamic types if you want them (implemented as a library).<p>Regarding incidental complexity, in a Hilney-Milner language, most code can be written without any type annotations whatsoever, although in my language of choice (Haskell), it is standard practice to include type annotations anyway to help readability.<p>Encoding invariants into the code does increase the complexity, and you&#x27;ll see most library writers strike a balance between complexity and correctness. If you go for an even stronger type system than Haskell&#x27;s (such as Coq&#x27;s, Agda&#x27;s or Idris&#x27;s) then it is possible to encode all invariants using the types, although type inference doesn&#x27;t work as well anymore.<p>Static, strong typing is there to help the programmer, and typing a dynamically-typed language is probably easier. Haskell&#x27;s type system helps automatic unit testing libraries such as quickcheck and hunit work better. Computer hardware doesn&#x27;t care about types, but rather where the bits and bytes are and what points to them. Static typing is there purely for the programmer&#x27;s benefit, rather than the computer&#x27;s.<p>I can&#x27;t say that writing software in a language that has a weak type system is anywhere as enjoyable, and I find myself having to debug my code.",1377556592

I&#x27;m not unaware of these issues.<p>But it&#x27;s not like utf-16 was invented to <i>solve</i> that problem so much as it was an accident that in the early days of unicode 2 bytes was enough to encode all code points and a 2 byte encoding was appealing as a universal solution in a way that a 3 or 4 byte encoding never would be. Some group of people on the planet will have to suffer 3 or more byte encodings no matter what. And I&#x27;d be happy to make it mine if it meant we could go with the better technical solution, if I had the power to do that.<p>All that aside it&#x27;s certainly not quite as clear cut as <i>any</i> language. Many languages have a mix of ascii and non-ascii characters and those fare better than they would with utf-16. And in the codepoints below 0x07ff (where utf-8 goes up to 3 bytes) there are character sets like greek, hebrew, arabic, and cyrillic. And as has been pointed out, ascii characters are often used in structural elements of documents and this factors into making it unlikely that the general case is as bad as the worst case (50% inflation) for most practical text.

About 100 years before contact with the Spanish, the Inca defeated the groups of people surrounding them (including the Chimu and Chanca), establishing the Incan empire. The last Inca to rule over a unified empire, Huayna Capac, was consolidating the rule in what is now northern Ecuador at the time of his death (probably from smallpox). His grandfather, Pachacuti, was the Inca who initially defeated the Chanca to establish the empire (or Tahuantinsuyu, as they called it).<p>Anyway, the point is, some of the people the Inca conquered, like the Chimu, may have had the beginnings of markets. However, the conquest of the Incas (who tended to claim that anyone they conquered were uncivilized and barbaric), and then the Spanish (who also waged an informational war), and compounded with the smallpox (which may have killed 90% of the large urban populations of South America), meant that most oral history was lost, and the method of reading the written history (if there is any, there&#x27;s some debate there) was seriously crippled.<p>ANYWAY, getting to the point, there&#x27;s some evidence but we don&#x27;t really know.",1377555056

He showed me how to properly hold and aim the shotgun, and then had me shoot a watermelon if I remember correctly.<p>He then explained matter-of-factly that it would do the same thing to a human, and that they would be permamently dead, so unless that is REALLY what needed to happen, not to use it.  He then told me where it was kept, and that it was kept loaded and was not to be viewed as a toy.  I could use it whenever I wanted, but only with adult supervision.<p>This actually worked rather well for two reasons.  It wasn&#x27;t forbidden, so I didn&#x27;t feel a need to mess with the guns just to break the rules.  He also specifically chose the shotgun, which has some insane kickback even if you are a fully-grown adult male, and it REALLY HURT when I used it.<p>I think gun locks are a bad idea for kids over about 5 or 6 because they WILL be able to find the key and unlock it.  Just like they know where the Christmas presents are hidden and everything else that the parents think they have hidden from them.<p>At the age of 8 most kids are capable of understanding things like death, unless the parents have let them be too sheltered.  They should have had a pet or two die already, perhaps a grandparent or other older relative, and older people they know through church or the like.

Lighter duty trucks are being carefully pared down in some aspects, but they are hardly being made into sissy-wagons- today&#x27;s quarter-ton trucks, for example, are commonly rated for 3/4 ton load capacity and 3 tons of towing.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean most of the US population was rural, just that the majority of the US by area is rural.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m getting a bit bogged down in the details. I just object to your characterization of trucks as a niche vehicle. While it may be technically accurate- as <i>everything</i> can be described as addressing a niche in the market- it implies the subset of the market is very small, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s accurate, particularly not in relation to many other categories of vehicle.<p>I do share your fears of trucks becoming too &quot;soft&quot; though. I already had to flee the SUV market and put a camper on a light truck instead, because of how SUVs have been changed. My hope is that the market demand for actual trucks is large enough to resist the trend.",1377554844

Or perhaps we don&#x27;t\n  have a shared definition of &quot;robust&quot; - for me, assuming\n  correct behaviour at the filesystem and block layer, I\n  believe deployment changes to be atomic.\n</code></pre>\nWhile OSTree itself may not need filesystem snapshot support, for &quot;robust OS upgrades&quot; (the original title of the ycombinator story) you do need some sort of snapshotting mechanism.  Whether that&#x27;s in the form of ZFS-style snapshots, or boot environments is up to the implementer.<p>Also, I&#x27;d argue that assuming correct operation at the filesystem and block layer is a pretty big assumption :-)  Even if the software itself works correctly, time has proven that trusting the hardware is not a good thing.<p>With that said, yes, I think OSTree <i>needs</i> filesystem snapshot support if admins are to rely on it to provide &quot;robust&quot; OS upgrades.<p><pre><code>  How do you determine reboot-needed=true? Is that\n  something assigned by the package developer statically\n  (i.e. kernel is reboot-needed=true)? Determined\n  dynamically at update time (like in the package metadata\n  for a specific revision?)\n</code></pre>\nCurrently, reboot-needed is determined by the package creator at the individual item level by tagging individual &quot;actions&quot; in a package manifest.  It&#x27;s a way for a package creator say &quot;this component can&#x27;t be safely updated on a live system, so force the creation and use of a boot environment clone when updating it.&quot;<p>Further refinement of this functionality is planned when applied to specific types of actions found in a package manifest, such as &quot;driver&quot; actions.  But it will be handled by the package system transparently.<p><pre><code>  Do you attempt to control for local configuration?\n</code></pre>\nIn what sense?  pkg(5) allows an admin to force the creation and use of a clone boot environment as part of any package-modifying operation.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about service configuration, that&#x27;s handled via SMF (the service management facility) which has its own snapshot system that services use.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about legacy service configuration that uses flat files on-disk, then package creators have the option of using service actuators to trigger a restart or refresh of the service whenever the configuration file changes.<p>You&#x27;d have to be more specific.<p><pre><code>  Is the X server package reboot-needed=true?\n</code></pre>\nNo, because any files that the X server needs are already loaded into memory so updates to the on-disk files won&#x27;t generally affect it.  Any changes made to the X server binaries and libraries on-disk won&#x27;t take effect until the X server is restarted.<p>An incompatible change in the X server itself (such as a protocol change, which is very rare) will likely come with a related kernel change which would require a reboot.  But again, the package creator is in control of that.<p>Also, the &quot;reboot-neededed&quot; tag doesn&#x27;t force a reboot per se; it just forces the update of a given component to be performed in a clone boot environment.",1377554734

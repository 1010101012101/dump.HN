8711782,comment,8710006,8710006,0,0,dschiptsov,,,"There are many good answers, like Vipassana, Dzongchen, even Yoga - any of derivatives of Upanishads and Buddha&#x27;s insights. The problems is that for most people it means nothing, or just a mythology, so they dismiss it with a first mention.<p>This could be rationalized, because, like it is with every &quot;good idea&quot; in the world, &quot;other people&quot; piled up such mountains of nonsense, and pushed that nonsense using the best manipulative techniques available to humanity, that some people developed an aversion, like for ads. You could think of teachings of various prophets or programming paradigms, economics or even physics and medicine - crowds of idiots ruined and discredited everything.<p>The essence of most of eastern &quot;spiritual traditions&quot; is remarkably straightforward - &quot;stay alone and use your own brain&quot;. It is that simple. The difference is only in wording  . Some traditions call it &quot;primordial awareness&quot;, some call it &quot;our true nature&quot;, others call it &quot;god within&quot; or &quot;That&quot; or &quot;Tao&quot; - it is not important. Like they said &quot;Truth is one (it points back to us - to &quot;our nature&quot;) the wise call it by different names&quot;.<p>So, stay alone and use (develop) your own brain. It doesn&#x27;t mean some radical bullshit like going in a desert. Rather it is more like Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the road&quot;, which is about being an observer of what is. Kerouac, by the way, didn&#x27;t get  Buddhism - he mere confused himself with that popular Tibetan folklore, but he was intuitive <i>practitioner</i>.<p>Another example could be like this - stop reading all that  nonsense in internet - blogs, forums, HN and do read one or two great books, like SICP or PAIP or watch a serious course, like CS61A on youtube. These courses and books are for developing your own understanding of fundamental principles. Then you would see what piles of nonsense are 99% of these internet postings.<p>So, the answer is <i>not</i> go to Vipassana retreat (btw, &quot;retreat&quot; means <i>solitude</i> (to avoid distractions), so all these groups is mere business) or to turn off all the  electronic devices. It means to stop paying attention to <i>blah-blah-blah</i> around you (that&#x27;s why ancient sages went to forests or mountains) and develop yourself.<p>Basically, it is about using (focus) your own awareness the way children before age of 4-5 do, before their minds would be polluted by piles of words and artificial, wrong concepts they learn from others. This ability of &quot;direct observation and knowledge extraction&quot; which is the very essence of so-called &quot;our human nature&quot; is, roughly, what they worship in Dzongchen.<p>All the answers are thousands years old.<p>Oh, by the way, two-three weeks in a solitude easy trekking in Nepal (Annapurna Circuit trek or Jiri-Gokyo trek) makes wonders. You could &quot;realize&quot; how good it is to be alone most of the time.",1417946369

Once we colonise another planet our concept of time (e.g. days, years etc) will be different to that of life on earth due to the shift in a planets orbit. Presumably every planet would require it&#x27;s own measurement of time e.g. a martian year so that those living there can keep time in relative terms. We&#x27;ll want a universal time however to synchronise events in time across all of our colonies. This would be the easiest problem as we can base it off of earth time.<p>2. If we were to encounter intelligent extra terrestrial life then we would need to agree on a concept of universal time to explain the history of our/their planet & species.<p>Does an idea for this universal measurement of time currently exist? If not then how would you expect it to look?",1417945665

What I don&#x27;t believe is that the workers aren&#x27;t out there, hoping to get hired.<p>I speculate that the reasons for the perceived - and ONLY perceived - shortage is that it&#x27;s far more difficult for employers and potential employees to find each other.  Another problem is that us engineers are expected to have real-world, paid experience in whatever technology the hiring company uses, rather than these companies providing on-the-job training.<p>At one time, a college degree and a demonstrable grasp of computing technology was all one needed.  Companies were happy to train.  No longer.<p>What really kills me is that when a new technology is introduced, one is _immediately_ required to know about it before getting a job where that technology will be used.  Consider that Swift, a new programming language that Apple hopes will make it easier to write iOS Apps, has only been available for a few months, yet one cannot get a job writing Swift code, unless one already has PAID Swift experience on one&#x27;s resume.

(And genetic drift can become locked in).<p>The researchers determined that humanity suffered a population bottleneck some ~100,000 years ago, which may have been related to a changing, drier climate. By looking at the genetic diversity preserved, they also determined that the population bottleneck suffered by the ancestors suffered by non-Africans must have been significantly more severe than the bottleneck seen in the ancestors of the Ju/&#x27;hoansi. 100,000 years ago must have been a pretty good time to live in southern Africa (compared to the rest of the continent).<p>Anyway, I believe that click languages were once widespread. The greatest genetic distance between any two populations on Earth is between the Ju/&#x27;Hoansi (in Southern Africa) and the Hadzabe (in East Africa). They both speak click languages, and those languages are unrelated.<p><a href=""http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2803%2900130-1?cc=y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2803...</a><p>I believe that at some time (between 150,000 and 70,000 years ago), all of humanity lived in a range from South Africa to East Africa and all spoke click languages. At some point, possibly as a result of the climatic event discussed in this paper, the genetic histories of the Hadzabe, the Ju/&#x27;hoansi, and another group diverged. That last group stopped speaking in clicks and also conquered the world: all the rest of humanity is ultimately descended from this small group. About 1500 years ago, Bantu farmers swept through southeast Africa and left the speakers of click languages persisting only in isolated deserts that couldn&#x27;t be farmed.",1417943806

Everything else freezes in the install. I'd forgotten about wubi. I'll get my unix fix that way.<p>Make no mistake, I'm not comfortable with the control Apple exerts over the hardware and software.<p>EDIT: Btw, Windows 7 is very nice if you use windows on a regular basis. Very fast on my 14"" Dell 1.4 GHz Celeron 1GB Radeon 9000.",1231927102

433437,comment,433359,433359,0,0,wheels,,,"This is exciting for us too.  Our engine uses some small parts of Qt, but we'd intentionally kept the usage somewhat limited in case we ever wanted to factor it out so that we could deliver our stuff in some form other than as a web service.  It's nice having that out of the way.<p>I'd also had a chance to chat with some of the Trolls before the news broke since my initial reaction was, ""What does this say about Nokia's future commitment to Qt?""  I'd guessed that Nokia would do free-as-in-beer licensing, but not free-as-in-our-competitors-can-fork-it licensing. Turns out that there are some reasonably sane business reasons for the switch.<p>It'll be interesting to see how Nokia plays their cards in the just heating up mobile platform wars and how Qt factors into that.",1231925304

433431,comment,433344,433344,0,0,thesethings,,,"I greatly respect the writer of this article (Tina Brown), however the post left a bad taste in my mouth. I disagree that workers being independent is disempowering (she didn't say it explicitly, but she said people were struggling), or that it <i>has</i> to be annoying for the businesses employing them.<p>My unsubstantiated hunch is that she's writing this from a mildly older-industry perspective, and that those businesses and workers might be struggling more with this.
I have many friends (in admittedly newer industries) who are thriving as independents. Not just financially, but the freedom and opportunity it gives them to travel and challenge themselves is great. Sometimes they take well paying gigs, sometimes they work for peanuts on crazy projects.<p>I guess I just disagree with the ""attitude"" of the article. That independence isn't something to ""settle"" for, but something to strive for. She writes like it's a result of a bad economy, but I think many kinds of work would be headed in this direction anyway, even if the economy were sailing.",1231924849

Or maybe he/she was looking for a genius who would be able to figure out how to code Poseidon in such a way that it would not crash.<p>There are lots of other reasons why a teacher might set specific rules for an exercise such as this, too.  Unfortunately you chose to ignore the instructions -- and you made the mistake of second-guessing him/her -- assuming that the teacher's goal was the end result and not the process of getting there.",1231924173

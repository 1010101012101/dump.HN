247246,comment,246606,247185,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"That is because, unlike most authors, Tolkien was actually trying to put symbolism into his work--he wasn't trying to just write a novel; he was telling an epic.  Being a linguist, he recognized that, in the many retellings of an epic, small embellishments are added in order to provide side stories and submorals.",1216173440
247245,comment,247160,247160,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Ok, I think I can condense this to one sentence:<p><i>If your adviser is an asshole, you probably won't graduate and your grad school experience will suck. Don't.</i><p>If you want to get a Ph.D. and do research, pick your adviser very carefully. It is the <i>most important decision</i> of your research career. Grad school isn't like school, it's an apprenticeship.<p>Pick your adviser (the person you are apprenticed to) on two factors: the success of their past students and how compatible you are personally with them. Their field should be peripherally related to yours, it doesn't have to be very close (1).<p>I had a great experience in grad school. I also had two great advisers.<p>(1) My advisers study scattering theory and complex variables. My Ph.D. was in computational physics. It wasn't a serious problem.",1216173399
247244,comment,234615,234615,0,0,gcv,,,"I learned most of what I know about database design through practice and making many enlightening mistakes. In all likelihood, I still don't design databases correctly, but at least going through some bad designs and suffering their consequences gave me an intuitive feel for what I should do. (That intuitive feel has translated into loathing for RDBMSes and relational data modeling in general, but that's an entirely different subject.)<p>In databases, the cleanest design often has bad performance characteristics. This clean design, called ""normal form,"" which has several different levels, boils down to minimizing the number of times a particular piece of data is stored in the database. In your example, it would typically be a mistake to store the comment twice. It wastes disk space, and all inserts and updates on the comment have to be done twice. Under some circumstances, copies of the comment may get out of sync.<p>To address your example, here is a simple, incomplete, and probably inefficient but fairly well-normalized table structure for something like HN:<p><pre><code>  users: id, nickname, password_hash, joined_on, karma, ...
  stories: id, user_id (person who posted the story), url, content, posted_on, votes, ...
  comments: id, user_id (person who posted the comment), content, posted_on, story_id, parent_comment_id, votes, ...
</code></pre>
In this table structure, stories refer to the person who posted the story by the poster's user primary key ID field. I made this ID separate from the user's name, and it would typically be monotonically increasing number (1, 2, 3, ...) or a GUID. (Some schools of thought advocate using a meaningful identifier, and would recommend making the user's nickname the primary key.) In the stories table, the user_id is foreign key into the users table, which simply means that it refers to entries in the users table. Comments also refer to users by the user's primary key, and they also refer to stories by primary keys in the stories table. In addition, comments refer to other comments, which allows parents to have a primitive hierarchical structure.",1216173303

Another response:<p>1. My tweets are more carefully crafted than the crap that flies out of my mouth, simply because they are limited to 140 characters.<p>2. Seems to start as a new point, but resolves to supporting the first. No matter if it is inane, it's social. Being human, social matters.<p>3. We lose gray matter getting frustrated in traffic and with social interaction. It's a lose-lose. I'd argue time and energy spent interacting (as opposed to not interacting) is not ill spent.<p>4. Agreed. Minus the reminiscent inclusion of dated technology. Typewriters... meh.<p>5. Give it time. The format for displaying and absorbing information is lagging behind the method for creating it.",1216173114

If microblogging is an evolution of blogging, it would make sense to revisit old ideas to see how they pan out with new technologies.<p>3. This one applies to the rest of the internet. You can waste hours perfecting a blog post or reading HN or /. or any other social (or nonsocial) news site.<p>4. I don't know about other people my age (I'm 18), but I remember having to spend time in HS/College working on papers that were over 140 characters.<p>Also, maybe it's just me, but I end up putting some thought into my tweets to make them fit in 140 chars instead of going over the limit.<p>5.

People notice it more with regard to English than art or music class, because you have to take English every year pretty much anywhere, while usually you stop taking art or music before you realize how bad it is.<p>I had a lot of great science and math teachers and a few great history teachers. I had some good English teachers but none who were really great. I think that's because people with math and science degrees have plenty of job opportunities, so only the ones who really want to teach high school even consider it. Probably the best English teachers I had were baby-boomer or older women who would have done something else if not for workplace misogyny. As they retired they were generally replaced by ignorant young women.<p>I love reading and I can write lucidly, but I knew people in college who had had really strong English instruction and can analyze a novel on first reading in ways that wouldn't even occur to me after a month of full-time study.",1216170005

186658,comment,186447,186641,0,0,paulgb,,,"> EDIT: Could the person who downmodded me please explain?<p>I upmodded you to balance it out, but it seems lately that some people are using downvoting to mean ""I disagree"", regardless of the quality of the comment. It seems that most sites with up/downvoting eventually turn into popularity contests for opinions, but I've always hoped news.yc could do better than that.<p>That said, I do disagree with your comment :). While I do like the Scribd reader, the problem of viewing PDF documents has been solved by a number of third party viewers which do not suck as much as Adobe's (as others have mentioned).",1210474113

186656,comment,186491,186614,0,0,neodude,,,"Probably the latter. Having Firebug IN the IDE would be invaluable and (r)evolutionary. A lot of the times I 'develop' by writing CSS in Firebug, then copy-and-paste the result into the actual CSS file.<p>Hm. That means I want a WYSIWYG, actually. Time to fork Firebug?",1210473639

186654,comment,186616,186616,0,0,neodude,,,"I have a similar problem. A lot of the time I merely find myself developing infrastructure instead of developing features. Part of the problem is writing in PHP without a framework (or, rather, a semblance of my own); a more significant part, I believe, is that I just really, really like building architecture. In that way, I'm probably being an architecture astronaut.<p>The key, as you've said already, is managing client expectations. At some point you must have given a timeline, given a prediction for how long you <i>thought</i> something would take you. At some point you must also have deviated from that timeline/prediction; mine, as far as I've identified it to, is being an architecture astronaut. Hence, the first step, I think, is to narrow the problem down to those deviations, and question why you're deviating so. The deviations may even be something useful or necessary. Rather, figure out what is breaking, then step back and look at the whole picture to see what needs to change.<p>Agile might be the answer here. At the very least, there are several very good ideas you can steal from agile to build your own approach to engineering.",1210473305

186652,comment,186447,186641,0,0,BSeward,,,"I didn't downmod you (nor can I, heh), but...<p>PDFs don't bother me at all. Years ago I would occasionally accidentally click on one and be filled with dread and loathing as the Adobe Reader plugin slugged to life, but that was a long time ago. I use Safari's PDF reader now, which does what and (more importantly) behaves like I expect it to.<p>Scribd documents don't behave like I expect them to. Pressing down arrow scrolls further than I expect it to, mousescroll is cadenced differently (and jumps around), and I can't press space to page down.<p>Scribd is definitely a solution to some problems, but—for me—reading PDFs is not one of them.",1210472771

186641,comment,186447,186585,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"It's funny, because saying ""Here's a PDF link"" in response to a Scribd document is to me almost like saying ""here's a WMV version"" to a YouTube page.<p>// <i>in fact, it's almost exactly like that, since the latter (Scribd/YouTube) is just a presentation layer for the former (PDF/WMV)</i><p>EDIT: Could the person who downmodded me please explain? I'll delete my comment afterward. Thank you.<p>EDIT2: After reading the two posts below, I now redact everything in this comment. :) I didn't say what I meant. I agree, I have no problems with PDFs either. However, I don't have a problem with WMVs either, since they open flawlessly in VLC. My point was that it's funny because I've gotten used to the worldview of ""Oh noooo, PDF!"" (and similarly, ""oh noooo, WMV!""), and now it's kind of funny to see the opposite happening (""here's a PDF!"" instead of screams of anguish).<p>Also, Paul, this is why I add a comment edit requesting clarification each time I get downmodded to 0 without a reply (and suggest my peers do likewise). Not because I disagree or find it questionable (I don't), I would simply like more feedback than that and hope it instills that habit into people reading my edit and the person who modded me down, since feedback is what makes Hacker News.",1210471600

186638,comment,186133,186133,0,0,webwright,,,"Spend nothing, at first.<p>The first thing you need to do is create an ""engine"".  Something where you can reliably introduce a user to it, and have that user ultimately invite at least 1 other user (on average).  In modern hype-infused parlance, this is a ""viral loop"" (with a viral co-efficient of more than 1).  But really, it's as old as the Internet.<p>You can achieve this in one of 3 ways:<p>1) Be surprising, controversial, funny, or useful.  People always tell their peers about fabulous products.<p>2) Get scientific about viral marketing.  Widgets, facebook apps, etc.  This is hard for most businesses (but for others-- it's laughably easy...  I know a guy who is serving up hundreds of millions of widget views on a product that essentially didn't evolve past the first 20-30 man hours of work).<p>3) Get smart about SEO (if your biz is a content play).  This is really just a different flavor of viral marketing.  Yelp, Digg, and other UGC sites have a great viral loop.  Visitors come. Some create content.  Content gets indexed.  Indexing generates google traffic for new page, which brings in users.  Rinse, repeat.  Wait 2 years and you have a vast pile of indexed content.<p>If you can't do these, then you're stuck buying attention with time or money-- which scales VERY poorly unless you have a great opportunity for revenue/profit. If you can pull these off, then marketing dollars/time is just adding gasoline to a healthy little fire.",1210471313

I gave Emacs about 1.5 months, and stopped because I didn't want to learn elisp and because I was getting pinky syndrome (I think that's the accepted term).<p>The switch to TextMate was laughably trivial, and I would have switched out far earlier if it wasn't for some of the slightly more advanced bundles.  Interestingly enough, while I learned the snippet system, I found myself using them very sparingly.<p>My Vim switch was cold turkey, and was reasonably straightforward.  I've been seriously typing at a keyboard for a long, long time, but Vim taught me that I didn't know a keyboard as well as I thought.  In the beginning, the Vim commands weren't as easy to get to (even if I knew them) as typing prose--I guess typing familiar words just become part of muscle memory.  It's been several months now, and I'm both happy with the switch and fairly proficient in Vim.<p>Gun to my head, I'd take Vim over emacs, but only marginally so.  It probably has to do with the fact that I didn't begin to customize my emacs environment.  I don't know if that's what I wanted though--I love that I just take my .vimrc (it's quite short), drop it on my server, and the only thing that's different is the fact that my theme is different to what MacVim offers me.

So do deals with sites involving that.<p>The point is that very few general users are going to give up  on Google results and think ""I wonder if what I'm looking for happens to be in a Flash file somewhere"". Of course, if it's thrown in for free with Google results then it might be used by general users, but not on its own.<p>And there are plenty of other new directions that people have suggested for your technology. Probably the best to see a return on your investment so far would be to provide precisely the feature that Google have announced to the second tier of search engines.",1214939570

Early on I was programming with Windows programs using typical GUI interfaces, although I'd also picked up the appropriate shortcuts of pico, joe, and jed.  This made emacs the most comfortable environment for me as I headed into coursework using Linux systems, even though I never used much more than cursor movement, copy/paste, and file saving.  At that point, I was pretty sure the vi cheatsheet on the lab wall was some kind of joke, like EDLIN in DOS.<p>But I later entered a new school with more coursework, and I found the emacs key combinations increasingly uncomfortable.  A few of my classmates were using vim and recommended it to me.  After several weeks of struggling with vim, I was eventually up to prior levels of productivity, with greater gains in the following months as I picked up more shortcuts.<p>I feel I perhaps didn't give emacs a fair shake, though, because I never used it as more than a glorified notepad.  The feeling I get from the various emacs articles I read online is that you don't see big gains in emacs over, say, vim unless you use a lot of custom elisp... a point I have not yet reached.",1214939529

You decided to enter a niche market that was basically only a niche market because the major players had chosen to overlook it. At any time they had the resources available to move in and you can bet that if you had become popular they would have come along to eat your lunch. If anything, this may even put you in a better position because now you've really got a fire under your ass to do something to separate your product from theirs. There's also the possibility that if you garner enough attention you'll be acquired.<p>P.S. Very neat search engine. I especially like the ActionScript view.",1214939441

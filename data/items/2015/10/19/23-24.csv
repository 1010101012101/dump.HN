Once everybody has chosen a route, there is a measure on the space of routes.  The cost of each route to each person depends on the measure on the route space.  Once you have this pairing of measures, you can ask if it&#x27;s optimal or not.",1445299181

Honestly, I didn&#x27;t do that well.<p>But I was approaching it very differently than I would if it was my job. Since the system that was set up gave high rewards to unpopular predictions, I just gambled on the few most unpopular that had at least some shot at reversing. It wasn&#x27;t the smartest approach, but it was the most fun. If I was doing it for real, obviously I&#x27;d go a different way.<p>The people who did best, at least from what I saw, tended to ride waves of popularity on the more active questions, buying low and selling high.<p>What I did was like betting on a few biotech startups, what the best scorers did was like riding waves of the market leading stocks.<p>In the end, I&#x27;m not that sure it had much to do with actual prediction of events. Then again, neither did my approach. I guess I&#x27;m not sold on the version of prediction markets they were using.",1445299141

10416615,comment,10415091,10416449,0,0,mikefivedeuce,,,"I wouldn&#x27;t confuse management companies with brokers and as the REITs themselves own the complexes they wouldn&#x27;t be considered a broker either. A broker acts as a middle man and pairs a potential renter with a building and collects a fee (which varies depending on the market). They&#x27;re a third party in the transaction. In Chicago, for example, brokers are compensated by the ownership and it&#x27;s typically one month&#x27;s rent. In New York, the renter pays the broker/locator directly.<p>Brokers do tend to spam craigslist and any other avenue because they are motivated to be the first point of contact for a renter. They&#x27;ll also buy up common domains and adwords to show up high on generic searches like &quot;luxury Chicago apartment&quot;. It&#x27;s not uncommon for them to represent themselves as ownership by using unlicensed pictures and vague wording.<p>I don&#x27;t think I follow your last two paragraphs. A year is a standard lease because there are significant turn costs when somebody moves out and often the apartment sits vacant for a month before a new tenant moves in. You can usually get a shorter term but you&#x27;ll pay up proportionately. Pet fees cover the damage that pets often cause and security deposits are heavily regulated in most major cities so that they can only be applied to legitimate documented expenses. In Philadelphia, for example, you are entitled to twice your security deposit back if your landlord doesn&#x27;t return it with 30 days or provide you with a list of itemized expenses.",1445299050

And this is beautiful:<p>> According to Gage’s theory, transposons may make such transformations possible; they may generate novelty, and therefore complexity, in a way that our genes alone cannot. If this is, indeed, why they are unsilenced during neural development, then our brains can be thought of as hosting a kind of evolution in miniature. Just as the beaks of Darwin’s finches are suited to different food sources, each neuron may develop its own specialty in the ecosystem of the brain. (Immune cells make use of transposons for similar reasons, exploiting them in order to generate a large range of antibodies to tag new intruders.)<p>But there&#x27;s a key bit of missing context, selection via programmed cell death:[0]<p>> The importance of programmed cell death (PCD) during vertebrate development has been well established. During the development of the nervous system in particular, neurotrophic cell death in innervating neurons matches the number of neurons to the size of their target field. However, PCD also occurs during earlier stages of neural development, within populations of proliferating neural precursors and newly postmitotic neuroblasts, all of which are not yet fully differentiated.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160604005020"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001216060...</a>",1445298914

A second secession movement and full-blown Civil War will probably never happen, but martial law ordered in response to protest or active resistance of a law is not unthinkable. The risk of death by gun violence in the United States is dwarfed by the risk of death by automobile accident, heart disease, and so on. I would absolutely rather live in a country of ~320 million with a few thousand deaths per year due to gun violence, than in one with no weapons to deter martial law. I&#x27;ll take a small (blown out of proportion by the media) threat over an existential threat any day.<p>And that&#x27;s even assuming that you <i>could</i> make gun violence disappear entirely overnight. Revoking access to registered firearms could very well reduce the number of spree shootings, but would do little to affect the black market supply used by criminals in robberies and turf wars, and probably <i>increase</i> the amount of gun violence used in robberies (as criminals would then be sure that no one would be able to resist them).",1445297565

I think they are very good for a certain scale of road/traffic. Mostly intersections with moderate amounts of traffic on average, and not high-speed. e.g., the main intersections within housing estates. Having too many of them instead of give-way signs drive you a little batty (I’m looking at you, Warrnambool) while really heavy traffic, major intersections work better with traffic lights.<p>My daughter recently got her learner license, and she has found roundabouts one of the trickier intersections to navigate. You have to read the traffic flow. This person about to enter on your right is going straight ahead, so will block you entering the roundabout[1], but they have to wait for that person coming the other way from you and going straight through, so you can slip in the gap that creates without cutting anyone else off. As with many things it is familiarity and practice that makes them work[2]. I think roundabouts work very well here for the most part, and my daughter is getting pretty good at reading the traffic. It’s not rocket science[3].<p>The science of roads and traffic I imagine is a surprisingly nuanced expertise involving a lot of physics and psychology. I find when I cross over the border to New South Wales I feel like a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs. I eventually figured out it was because the signage was a different distance before the intersection compared to my home state. Once I was aware I could adapt.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10242816"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10242816</a><p>[1] We drive on the left side of the road because Australia is in the southern hemisphere.<p>[2] I bet the first traffic lights caused an uproar. “Why the hell should I stop just because there’s a red light?!”<p>[3] Oh wait, actually, it is rocket science.",1445295884

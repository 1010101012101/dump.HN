8414023,comment,8413979,8413979,1,0,tjradcliffe,,,"Students have <i>always</i> been stupid. The only thing that changes is the reason. It used to be newspapers. Then comic books. Now Google.<p>The hand-wringing and moral panic are always talked up by innumerates who have neither measured the purported decline in student capabilities nor adduced any reason as to why the technology in question creates the purported affect--at least, they never give any reasons that go beyond pandering to the prejudices of their own generation.<p>Generally, technology improves intellectual capabilities. Newspapers informed. Comic books introduce young people to stories they might not have encountered otherwise. Texting improves literacy (what <i>else</i> would you expect from a technology that allows young people to carry on complex social lives entirely via the written word?) and the kind of transparent access to a diversity of information sources that Google provides increases a wide range of intellectual capabilities by giving students access to actual facts to think about, rather than the completely useless contents of their imagination.<p>It is true, as the article says, that certain formerly-important skills will be lost, and the <i>type</i> of mistake we used to make will be replaced by a new <i>type</i> of mistake. But are the new types of mistake more frequent (unlikely, and not mentioned) or more severe (also unlikely, also not mentioned) than the old types of mistake? Strangely, anti-Bayesian articles like this one never even try to do a proper accounting of the number of old-type mistakes avoided by the technology, focusing entirely--and misleadingly--on the types of mistake enabled by the new technology. This is lazy, dishonest and misleading.<p>To put it another way, work-processing has had a terrible effect on typing accuracy, but who cares?",1412560358

Heather More and Shawn O’Connor of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia and their colleagues measured so-called sensorimotor responsiveness in the giraffe: how long it takes a nerve signal to travel from a muscle in the ankle up to the brain and back again. Reporting in the Journal of Experimental Biology, the researchers found that the nerve conduction rate in the giraffe is pretty much the same as it is in a shrew, rat or any other mammal.<p>>Given the comparatively greater distance a nerve signal has to travel in the giraffe, Dr. More said, it’s possible the giraffe faces real challenges in reacting quickly to events down under — a rock beneath its hoof, or a bite to its ankle.",1412560075

8413999,comment,8412085,8412665,1,0,tzs,,,"Not a good example. The Rodney King video played a large role in getting the officers acquitted.<p>Without the video, the prosecution would have had eyewitnesses and the injuries to King, which were pretty damning. The defense would not have really had anything to counter that.<p>With the video, the defense was able to take a step by step approach to the defense. They showed that the first blows were in response to King being uncooperative or aggressive, and were probably justified. They then framed the issue as when, if ever, did the beating switch from justified force against an aggressive suspect and turn to excessive force against a man who had stopped fighting and submitted?<p>Each time King was hit, he&#x27;d twitch or kick or flail an arm or a leg. The defense started with the first blows, which they were able to justify because King did start out aggressive, and then they went blow by blow, looking at the position of each officer and what he could see, showing that each saw one of those kicks or flails of King&#x27;s, and that from his position the officer could not see that was an involuntary response to a prior blow. From what the officer could see, King was still violently resisting, and so that officer would take a swing. The defense would show that caused an involuntary response that made the next officer think King was still fighting.<p>They went all the way through the video that way, getting the jury to focus on the difficulty of pointing to any point and saying that this was where the line was crossed.<p>This worked, and they got acquittal.<p>No video, and the jury would have likely focused on the totality of what happened to King, and then it would be hard not to find excessive force.<p>I think the video also made the prosecution overconfident. I think they thought it was going to as simple as showing up, playing the self-evident video, proving that the accused were the officers in the video and that the video was real, and that would be it.",1412559529

Due to some unfortunate issues, bad business decisions (eg. bad money spent on SEO, design work, etc), business partners being spread across different cities and just priorities we let go of the site.

In our prime we were number 3 on google for &quot;Free Ringtones&quot; and over the past 5 years have had over 52Million page views and 6million unique views.\nthe problem with selling on flippa is that lately due to us not having time to keep the site up and only making money from adsense the revenue has dropped dramatically BUT we do have a database of over 180K registered users and 120K ringtones.

Instead, they are implanted directly into the brain during surgery and wired to a port on the animal&#x27;s head. There&#x27;s still some risk, since one still has to remove the skull above the target site and also cut and resew the dura mater, but the skin can be sewed back together after implantation and the bone will eventually regenerate. Unlike in an acute preparation with a chamber, there is no exposed dura that needs to be cleaned regularly to prevent infection, and the electrodes are inserted just once instead of repeatedly.<p>If the recording contacts are sufficiently dense, the total area of skull that needs to be removed to implant 1000 channels worth of arrays may actually be less than in a conventional two-chamber (maybe even single chamber) acute primate preparation.

The more unlikely part here is that those voyages would have been made known to a random Venetian barbarian who happened to be passing through, and that said Venetian would be able to obtain such detailed maps. If I were going to come up with a hypothetical explanation for the maps beyond 20th century forgery, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s more likely that some 16th century Manila galleon strayed a bit north on the return trip to Acapulco and did some secret mapping. The Spanish Manila route actually got surprisingly close to Alaska: <a href=""http://historicphilippines.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ruta-de-urdaneta-02-600x344.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://historicphilippines.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ru...</a><p>That&#x27;s a stretch too, of course.

The price should naturally follow, and then to imagine scenarios you may not be familiar with, but are still real. Here are a few:<p>* More efficient inter and intra-organizational business systems. I am unsure of how involved academia and consulting have been with bitcoin and cryptos, but JIT payments seem like a very attractive proposition, especially with trusted partners, and especially in corporate contexts. Does your local bank have an API that allows easy funds transfers? Perhaps bitcoin can simplify the accounting function. There has to be benefits and cost-savings. CEOs may ask the question.. &quot;we can get bitcoins, but then what?&quot;<p>* As mentioned elsewhere in the thread. Adoption in Africa or some other nation: the Orkut phenomenon. It&#x27;s not about doubt in the USD (also mentioned in the thread) but rather doubt in one&#x27;s own currency from inflation (or some other unreliability.) This is Draper&#x27;s view. I think the key is to combine bitcoin with a fiat note (or some newer crypto down the line) and reduce reliance on banks. That&#x27;s the sweet spot.<p>* To avoid bank confiscations, eg Cyprus. Having some money is better than having money that&#x27;s been largely confiscated. Bitcoin makes any nasties in government and corporations think twice. It&#x27;s wealth insurance. And if/when confiscations occur, the price could rise higher than what you paid for them (but until then, it might seem like a loss.)<p>* I suppose bitcoin could become a type of digital backbone currency, due to it being the first (but not the last) Cc. It really depends on the roll out, which has a number of  imperatives driving it. It&#x27;s worth looking at various business and use cases of bitcoins, and once these start reaching larger audiences, the usage should expand.<p>* Online activities needing anonymity: use your imagination.<p>* The currency could be faster to use, but it&#x27;s usable enough for above things.",1412557249

These two are close enough in performance to where people should pick the framework that best serves their needs, their designs, and their brains.<p>Big deal -- there are now two ways (at least) to accomplish the same outcome in Python. Competition is good. I'm guessing that this will be a call to arms for the Twisted community and we'll see development accelerate.<p>At the same time, it is likely that a development community will form around Tornado. Great!<p>It's like people saying, when the Mac OS first launched, ""Why didn't they just use DOS --it's there and it works."" And yet the Mac OS has had a positive impact on operating systems produced by Microsoft. And Microsoft has impacted the Mac OS. It's all good.<p>And why is it that this same argument doesn't occur every time a non-async framework appears for python or other languages? What is it about the async nature that polarizes people? Maybe it's the fact that the both also start with the letter ""T"" and the name ""Tornado"" is a better named than ""Twisted"" (which implies increased complexity even if it isn't there...of course Tornados ultimately make a mess of things, so that's not it).<p>I, personally, am excited about Tornado. I think there's room for more than one player -- especially given the 'real time' direction the web is heading. And if this negatively impacts Twisted, then it'll be because Tornado has come up with an easier to understand approach and they'll benefit from being new and easy to grok -- in the same way Rails was once an easy-to-grok framework and that's what made it easy to understand.<p>The biggest winner, in my opinion, is the Python community and who doesn't want that?",1253213821

828653,comment,827358,828351,0,0,akeefer,,,"Let me try to phrase the argument more clearly:  if you want to pass on a checked exception via redeclaration in the ""throws"" clause, you've broken encapsulation because a change to the lower layer implies changes all the way up the stack.  If bar() was originally calling readDatabase() that threw a SQLException, and I change it to call readFile() that throws an IOException, if I'm passing that exception up the stack I have to change bar's signature purely due to an implementation change, and so on up the stack.  So a change at the lower layer has now forced me to make changes all the way through my application stack.  Henceforth, encapsulation is broken by what should just be an implementation change.<p>The only way to avoid that break of encapsulation is to catch the exception immediately in bar(), and then do something with it:  either handle it, or rethrow it as something else, either a runtime exception or as a different checked exception.  But that also isn't really ideal; in my experience, about 98% of the time even checked exceptions are throw-up-your-hands sort of programmer errors that you want to bounce a fair way up the stack to some more central error-handling location, or to kill the high-level operation being attempted.  In other words . . . you generally just want to treat them exactly like runtime exceptions.<p>So while the theory of type-safety around checked exceptions is nice and all, in practice if you actually use them as part of type signatures they massively couple all the layers of your application, and I find them much more annoying than useful.",1253213254

The truth is, I chose that major when I was barely 17 years old, and it was accidental. I chose my major from a drop-down list on a web application. I was going to choose Computer Science, but then I saw ""Computer Engineering"" and thought it sounded  more impressive, so I chose that one. Little did I know how different the coursework was at the time. But I stuck with it until I was 21. Then something hit me. I didn't really enjoy my major at all.<p>At UT-Austin, the ""recommended"" degree plan for EE only has 1 elective, no foreign language, and probably 8 classes on circuits. I couldn't help but feel like I had missed out on something, so I decided to take some extra time.<p>So when I reached my senior year, I decided to drop all of my EE classes the next semester and signed up for all Philosophy classes. Took out a student loan and got a couple student jobs as a web developer, and took my time taking 6 hours a semester for the next 2 years. Ended up moving into a student co-op (an awesome experience), partied, met the girl who would become my wife, got 2 years of work experience, read a lot of philosophy books and novels, took a foreign language, learned to play guitar, and did everything else I had wanted to do.<p>So that's how I ended up as an EE/Philosophy double major and took 6 years to graduate.

828636,comment,828416,828416,0,0,jyellin,,,"First and foremost, procrastination is death. We were born to take action, even if the action we take is not in the direction of our ideal life, it still enables us to begin a journey and experience everything that the world will present on our path. I believe that life is a puzzle, made up of millions of pieces, or in other words experiences; career, school, relationship, money, vacation, camp, good times, bad times, sickness, regret, deceit, etc. This list could literally go on forever, but what is important to realize is that every single experience that takes place in your world will provide you with a piece to your puzzle of life. Each of these pieces will enable you to get closer to completing your puzzle and having your ideal life being revealed to the world. Now you might be asking yourself, how many people get to the point of actually completing their puzzle? And the answer is extremely few, if any, because human nature is most comfortable, in an uncomfortable way, to be a “fence sitter.” The definition of a “fence sitter” is someone whose complacency and over-analysis of every situation prevents personal growth, and ultimately the puzzle from being completed. So, what I ask you to keep in mind as you begin to make the first magnanimous decision in your life is to listen to what your “gut” is telling you to do. Your intuition will never lead you in a path where you will not grow and when making a decision, if you are unable to look in the mirror and feel comfortable with the person who looks back, then realize that you lying to yourself. The feeling of doubt is called “The Unknown,” because regardless of what path you take, it will be uncharted territory in your world. But like Alan Alda once said, “You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you’ll discover will be wonderful. What you’ll discover is yourself.” Trust yourself…we are all born with all of the tools that we need to live a life filled with endless opportunities, but it is your choice if you decide to use all of them! Good luck….",1253212798

What if they're not savvy enough to add an SSH account for me to upload things through?  What if they're too nervous to hand out login credentials or create new accounts, and insist on uploading things themselves?  Which of these issues are ""I can work with it,"" and which are ""This client is too stubborn to work with?""  I've dealt with folk on both ends of the spectrum, and sometimes I'm really not sure if I'm ""bending over backwards,"" or just ""being flexible.""<p>The second quandary ties into the first.  If I'm working on a static site--just HTML, CSS, images, and possibly some JavaScript (no AJAX)--then it's no big deal to zip it up, send it to the client and let them upload it at their leisure.<p>But, dynamic sites... even if I'm just customizing a codebase I've already written for this customer, things quickly become nontrivial: If they have a shared hosting environment, what if it costs extra to use a database?

The working world has far more jobs for your skills than you might think.<p>- So far outsourcing software seems just to have caused more software to be written and more innovation. The demand for software has increased.<p>- You can get into a way of thinking that whatever you do there is always something better: accept the choices you make and see where they lead.

Some are downright ridiculous (telling you to change stuff the previous audit told you to do).<p>I don't think it is appropriate to advertise any IPSPs here, the biggest things to look at are segregated merchant accounts, how long have they been in business, hold back period, fees, integration capabilities, customer service department reputation and references.<p>Roughly in that order.<p>It also helps if they process a sizable volume so that when there is a problem it is not just your problem.<p>Masking your own URL is the one thing that always seems to come up as a 'desirable' because nobody likes to send the customer elsewhere at the moment of making the sale.<p>But in practice it doesn't really matter much, as long as you get editorial control over the content of the landing page on the IPSP side and the customer is aware that a transition is going to happen and they get back to where they were on completion of the transaction. The latter is very important.<p>If your IPSP can not give you that sort of functionality then it might be problematic, it could cost you sales.<p>Using your own SSL certificate is not going to be enough to mask the IPSPs URL, after all, once the data captured gets posted you are on their domain anyway. I personally prefer to have the transition happen at the same moment you go from unencrypted to encrypted, that way you sort of guide the customer to the very last step before the payment happens. Depending on your environment that means they've filled up their cart or selected the type of subscription they wish to purchase and then the next click will take them to the 'checkout' where their payment information is captured.<p>I agree the repost seems wrong, but the good news here is that if you are in https anyway then caching is not your problem. No browser or proxy will cache that stuff, if it has passed there once during the post it might as well pass twice more, no harm done.<p>The only thing that is vulnerable to is mitm and by that time that has already happened, the only difference being that your mitm now has three copies of the data instead of just one.",1253212100

Tagging is the primary means by which photos are made social: when a user uploads a photo, they can “tag” their friends who appear in the photo. Notifications are sent to tagged friends letting them know that a new tagged photo of them exists on Facebook, and feed stories are published on both the tagger’s and taggee’s profiles.<p>Users who receive a notification that they have just been tagged usually investigate the photo. If they don’t want to be associated with the picture, they “detag” themselves from it. Similarly, users who see a feed story about their friends being tagged in photos often check out the photo.<p>2) Asking a new user for permission to automatically send invites to all of their GMail contacts. When you register for twitter, you have the option of allowing twitter to automatically log-in to your GMail account and send out invites to all of your contacts.<p>3) One of the earliest known examples of viral marketing on the web was HotMail. Every email message that you sent from HotMail included a signature inviting the recipient of the email to join HotMail.<p>4) PayPal was another early example of viral marketing. With PayPal, you could send money to anyone with an email address -- even if they were not a PayPal user. However, in order for the recipient to claim their payment, they would have to open a PayPal account.<p>What are your favorite examples of viral expansion loops on the web?

But I did play with it a little, and from what I saw it has the same core functionality as the rich client.  Not sure about the fancier stuff like Outlook task integration.  But it's certainly the case that you'll be able to create notebooks, sections, and pages, and take notes as you normally would.<p>Sorry that's not a great answer - I'd never used OneNote before this summer and I still don't know all the features even in the rich client, so it's hard for me to say if the web app is equally ""flexible"".<p>> it's a great app but it never made a lot of sense for me since I use a lot of different machines).<p>Isn't there a way, even in Office 2007, to share a notebook across multiple machines?

The whole reason I enjoy Lisp is for how it has inspired me to do streaming models of compilation.  When you're updating things dynamically, the most important thing is to have a logical object model - starting with getting your ""(UML) package diagram"" correct.  Otherwise you end up with a large system that requires the entire system to be locked up for minutes while you do the upgrade, because different parts of the system depend too much on physical model details.  That's why you separate message from method. So you can do this in any language, some easier than others.",1253211077

If you screw up, you'll have a very tough time finding the mistakes, since the system doesn't tell you where the mistake might be. It prevents you from repeatedly patching your system rather than redesigning it, which is a big problem I see in a lot of programmers.<p>It's not good for the absolute beginners, but for people who know a little bit how to think about algorithms and data structures, and are trying to improve their code quality, it seems like a good exercise. I know I've had some rewarding experiences debugging code by thinking about it; using a debugger, while easier, seems generally less satisfying.",1253210657

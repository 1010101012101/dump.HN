I remember reading some chatter about them replacing users amazon affiliate tags with their own.<p>Amazon links on that site get changed to point to rads.stackoverflow.com which sounds like it violates the TOS.<p>I only ask because I've been slowly puttering around the idea of creating a little website as a side project, and I was considering ""borrowing"" this idea from them (though I was going to preserve affiliate ids from users, if they were entered).",1267775766
1169020,comment,1165481,1167752,0,0,RevRal,,,"Oh the frustration, eh? And it gets more annoying every time.<p>I still don't have a clear idea on how one can reject objective reality, or reject what is real.<p>There have been some simularities between all my confrontations over the years: the people don't make very much sense; they demand respect for their ""opinion;"" and, they attribute arrogance to believing in an objective reality.<p>Somewhere, they learned the wrong thing. And I think I've deduced part of the problem: they take the subjectivity of some definitions as a sort of proof that an objective reality doesn't exist, and at an intuitive level, they don't accept reductionism.<p>Definitions being a form of reductionism. That is to say, at a very fundamental level, they take issue with you saying ""this orange weighs .3kg ."" They won't confront you for saying that, but if they happen to like the movie Joe Dirt, and you say ""Joe Dirt is a bad movie,"" watch out. You are now offending <i>their</i> reality and it is now very personal.<p>And just to further clarify, when I say ""the subjectivity of some definitions,"" I mean the various degrees of allowed interpretation of ideas. There are different degrees of subjectivity to different ideas: people have an amount of leeway to define some things for themselves, such as love, as it is not very well understood anyway. However, some ideas are very close to a real, concrete, one-to-one, definition of reality.<p>Yet these people have it in their head that they can make up whatever they want with anything, even though they don't normally execute this power to make up whatever they want. But they <i>do</i> get caught up on their <i>right</i> to make up whatever they want, which boils down to rejecting objective reality. I think there's some kind of empowerment high and self-consolation that ""opinions"" hold merit by merely existing, even for concepts that aren't lenient with subjectivity.<p>This submission is pretty much dead but I hope you read this comment since I had this Aha! while reading your comment. This is a rough sketch of something I'm going to expand upon, but hopefully I explained it well enough for now.",1267775715

And this isn't even a place where SQL is at all problematic!  Perhaps this supports your DCOM argument though, in that it's the abstraction layers that really cause the problem.<p>That said, it's great that you're re-examining the problem; that's how progress is made.",1267775573

  engineers, now online, the correct unplanned failover procedure 
  operations document is confirmed, and is ready to be used by 
  the oncall engineer. The actual unplanned failover procedure for

  any problems. Traffic resumes serving normally, read and write.

1169011,comment,1168289,1168420,0,0,a1k0n,,,"You know, I didn't even once mention the language I used.  Realtime constraints and searching speed were the driving factor here; you have to return a move in under one second.  I didn't want to risk GC pauses, and I'm not good enough with Haskell to guarantee I'm writing fast code.  Otherwise I probably would have used something else, but I don't consider it all that important.  Really, there wasn't anything too complicated data-structure-wise to do.  In fact it does next to no dynamic allocation.  I wanted to use destructive updates for speed when doing a backtracking search on a map.  The hard part was just implementing various recursive algorithms, and C++ didn't really get in the way of doing it except that it would have been nice to have multiple return values.<p>I did have some problems throughout the contest with my choice of C++ -- in fact without Valgrind, my entry may never have run correctly.  (Turns out one of my algorithms was ""escaping"" off the border of the map and scribbling in RAM)  But hey, I've been dealing with problems like that for more years than I care to count right now.",1267774826

1169008,comment,1168806,1168992,0,0,coffeemug,,,"If the query language is designed with this in mind, the compiler would detect that a non-realtime query is passed to a database marked as realtime and would throw an error. Of course the user could issue N realtime queries from within a host language, but that would involve really trying to work against the database. A good analogy might be CORBA/DCOM vs. SOAP. In DCOM days it was easy to call many different functions while being oblivious that each call requires a network roundtrip. Most programmers made this mistake most of the time. With SOAP, you can still work this way, but it makes the likelihood of this happening in practice significantly lower because it exposes the issue to the programmer.<p>Regarding your argument of a fuller optimization, presumably a well designed query language would be flexible enough to allow the user to express <i>every</i> possible realtime query (assuming this is theoretically possible), so the user doesn't need to combine smaller queries via host-language trickery. People have been trying to fix the optimizer for decades, but most production optimizers still have plenty of edge cases. Perhaps redefining the problem is exactly what the doctor ordered?",1267774352

1169006,comment,1167925,1168328,0,0,cduan,,,"Two bases for the rejections: one for lack of statutory subject matter (no machine or transformation under Bilski) and one for obviousness (combining an article about patent trolling with the PTO's prosecution manual makes the claimed method obvious).<p>With regard to subject matter, the applicant makes two arguments: (1) patents are like personal property, so they satisfy the ""transformation of matter"" prong of Bilski; and (2) one of the steps involves computer research (basically, Google searching), which involves a machine.<p>With regard to obviousness, the patent applicant argues that the prosecution manual does not contain all the steps of the claimed method.<p>In my mind, the big issue is that the applicant most likely wrote the claims up based on what other patent trolls have done before.

For example, creating things asserts one's existence and, by feeling alive, one is able to avoid thinking about your own mortality, if even for a moment. Having another person acknowledge your creativity or your work has all kinds of positive effects not having to do with sex. People trying to shoehorn motives into sex (or tangential things that lead to sex as a way to point to sex as the root motivator) are wrong.",1327129197

There are several explanation for this finding.  First, news reporting tends to concentrate on the 'horse race' aspects of the campaign: Who is ahead in the polls? Who is running the campaign? Which states are being contested by the campaigns? Will the candidates attack one another? Who will be included in the presidential debates? The answers to these questions may be news, but they simply do not help voters decide which candidate should be elected president...<p>From January through October of 1980, CBS and UPI devoted 65 percent of their coverage to the horse race, 26 percent to issues, and 10 percent to candidates...<p>A second reason why voters cannot rely on the news media for policy information is that campaign news is only one story among many. The network news, for example, is a half hour long, but subtracting commercials, stories on non-campaign topics, and horse-race coverage leaves little time to explain the candidates' opposing views on policy questions. Particularly in the latter phases of a campaign, political ads, presidential debates, and other message forms provide more issue information to viewers than the news media...<p>To make matters worse, there may be a trend toward less and less coverage. The length of a typical political news story decreased by about 20 percent and the number of political news stories dropped by 20 percent from 1968 to 1988...average nightly news coverage of the campaign in 1996 was 12.3 minutes, down from 24.6 minutes in 1992...Furthermore, the news media have a tendency to offer short sound bites from candidates instead of thoughtful and extended consideration of issues...in 1968, the average quotation from candidates in the news was 43 seconds long. After 20 years, candidate quotations had shrunk to a mere 9 seconds...this figure had dropped to 8.2 seconds in 1996.""",1327128815

3492822,comment,3491542,3491897,4,0,Irfaan,,,"There's no reason you can't mix the two, though.  At my startup, we're building narrative driven games (like the old-school graphic adventures), reworked to feel more TV-like.  So we're really trying to be careful about the whole passive vs active issue.<p>Our take is - let the viewer be as passive as they want.  We're making a narrative-heavy experience, just like films and TV.  But we're adding an interactive twist so the viewer can change how the story unfolds.  And there's no reason we can't let the viewer just hit play and watch the story unfold as-is.  We encourage them to jump in, of course, but that's it - otherwise, the story goes along it's glide path till the end of the episode.  And when they're done, maybe they'd like to watch it again, but make a decision part way in to see how it effects the story.<p>A more mainstream example would be some on Nintendo's most recent work.  They've done a great job embracing the casual audience, and really pushed it in the most recent Super Mario Bros for the Wii - it actually included the ability for the game to play <i>itself</i> when players get stuck:<p><a href=""http://wii.ign.com/articles/994/994640p1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wii.ign.com/articles/994/994640p1.html</a><p>Passive vs Active is tricky balancing act, and we're probably going to need to iterate on this a few times before we get it just right.

It's a vicious (or virtuous, depending on which side you're on) circle: a company spends marketing money, which attracts theaters, which means big audiences for the movie, which means that newcomer with a minor role gets exposure, which increases their appeal as a lead actor, which means their next movie will make more money. There are only so many actors who can appear in a 'major' release because a) there are only so many screens and b) there are even fewer movies showing on those screens because the blockbusters dominate the limited number of screens. There are always more actors (and directors and screenwriters, etc) that have the capacity be 'stars' than the system can accommodate.

3492764,comment,3491246,3491796,3,0,aspensmonster,,,"I have worked as a ""Chat Tech""/""Junior Administrator"" --tier one support-- for a little over a year now for HostGator. I typically do phone calls rather than chats but the experience across each is similar. That said, none of this reflects the official endorsement or opinions of HostGator.com LLC.<p>The type of concern ""joering2"" has is obviously not something we handle at a first encounter level. It's not even a ""support"" issue in the normal sense. It's an infrastructure issue. Support chats and phone calls aren't going to end 15 minutes later with me having: designed, developed, tested, and deployed an entirely new password storing, reset, and re-send mechanism. This is true for any company that one has a widespread concern with regarding their policies and infrastructure. I may not approve of Microsoft's policy of forcing me through a ""Customer Retention Specialist"" when I wish to cancel my excess Xbox live subscription, but haranguing the poor girl I'm speaking to about company infrastructure and policy issues is a waste of her and my time.<p>That said, for HostGator, if you want to quickly reach someone regarding this type of concern, here's an email address: feedback@hostgator.com.<p>With regards to ""registryrocket.com"" I can assure you that it is and has been the bane of every tech's existence here at HostGator. Some explanation: HostGator used to, and still does, resell domains through eNom. When you visit ""registryrocket.com"" -- visit <a href=""http://hostgator.com/domains"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hostgator.com/domains</a> in order to get a working session -- what you are seeing is eNom's idea of good default site design and then their idea of user experience. The user experience with this tool is... lacking. To put it this way: I've never had a call where a customer told me how easy and great purchasing a new domain through hostgator.com/domains was.<p>Moving on, this is not a system that we directly administer and control, so far as I know. It is a service hosted on and developed by eNom, as stated on their own page describing the product: ""We take care of the website hosting, merchant processing and other eNom services."" (<a href=""http://www.enom.com/help/faq_rr.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enom.com/help/faq_rr.asp</a>). This, the poor user interface for managing domains, and the general frustration of having to work with an external registrar rather than being in complete control, has led to us forming our own registrar: ""LaunchPad."" We're already registering new domains under this tool and getting a live web interface for it has been a huge request both from our customers and us lowly tech and sales staff. Here's to hoping the hiring push for development talent pays off :)",1327125724

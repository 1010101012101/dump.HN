2950022,comment,2949149,2949149,1,0,zokier,,,"I think the major problem here is that CS and programming are too intermixed in education (and thus in the industry too). Uni degrees (<i>imho</i>) should educate <i>scientists</i> who study their field and do research.<p>If we continue on the swimming analogy: You don't actually need to know how to swim to research swimming. You just need to know how to gather data (by studying swimmers), and how to analyze that data to draw some conclusions.<p>I think the mixup is reflected in the comments here on HN too, people going to study CS in hopes to learn to program, with no intention in becoming a scientist. And then they are disappointed when the CS curriculum is trying to train them to be scientists.<p>imho the whole computer related education needs a complete re-engineering, from primary schools to universities. We need to assess what kind of people we need (scientists, engineers, mechanics, professionals, common people, etc?), and what skills they need to be efficient at their future jobs. I think it's quite clear that the concept of having CS and throwing everything computer-related there is not working very well atm.",1314885495

Is my understanding correct?<p>From my experience a state machine is more of a pattern then a real object. Implementing it on the fly is what worked best so far, for me. Of course there is a point where it gets nasty because of complexity. But first that is always the case (complexity IS nasty) and second overcommiting to structure and architecture increases the complexity already in the beginning and might hurt more then it helps. At least fully coding all possible state machine behaviour as the first default task ifor every new project doesn't seem to be a smart thing to do.",1314885038

I suppose how abstract your knowledge can be depends on what you're trying to do.<p>For example, I think game designers need to know a significant amount about how game engines work: maybe not the algorithms of, say, gouraud shading, but they do need to know what's possible and not possible in NPC AI, and the more complex the behavior they're designing is, the more they need to know about how NPC AI actually works, to have even a reasonable guess at how their ideas would translate into reality.<p>A few people have argued this under the labels ""computational thinking"" and ""procedural literacy"", a category of skills that doesn't necessarily involve knowing the syntax of C++, but <i>does</i> entail being able to think in terms of algorithms and technologies. There's also an older idea of ""design thinking"" that sees it as almost always including some technical aspect; that's common in architecture, where the ideal architect is a designer but still quite familiar with at least parts of material science.",1314885011

2949987,comment,2949323,2949942,3,0,Silhouette,,,"> That's ludicrous, because you're taking a narrow (and objectively wrong) definition of 'market' and 'market value'.<p>No, I'm just suggesting that 'market value' has little relevance to 'actual value of contributions'.<p>> The spread in pay is much lower than you suggest it should be because the market discounts for the difficulty in quantifying the marginal added value between programmers that you suggest exists - in other words, it's too hard for employers to find out about this difference<p>The thing is, if that were true, employers wouldn't be willing to spring for huge pay rises when they realise they are otherwise sure to lose a key developer. However, in my experience, they often are willing to go to those lengths.<p>I think there is a much simpler explanation for the discrepancy between performance and compensation for programmers: too many good programmers don't realise how much more productive they are than the bad ones, and they often don't have the kind of mindset and/or training to fight for better compensation alone, and in the absence of professional bodies/unions/whatever they will just accept what they are given. This doesn't mean they aren't worth more, it just means that as a profession software developers tend to be lousy negotiators compared to the people who do it for a living.<p>As for the 10x thing, it's actually much worse than that, because there are a lot of programmers out there who are clearly (to the rest of the programmers on their team) making a net negative contribution. They drain more from other positive contributors than they contribute themselves. In short, you would be better off firing them. This often doesn't happen, whether because employment laws make it prohibitively difficult in your jursdiction or just because management are too incompetent to measure and understand the problem so they can deal with it.<p>(I always find it odd that managers in software development groups seem convinced of their own worth and that it is higher than most people working under them, yet they rather consistently fail to measure and control even basic productivity and progress within their groups. If managers can't figure out which developers are the 10x guys and who to fire, maybe the managers need to take a pay cut to their own true and very small value until they can.)",1314884656

There's a a few skills in the middle of that process; slicing, optimizing, organizing, and css. Often enough neither designer nor coder is proficient in this area.

The chances of me <i>ever</i> doing anything in the company in a warehouse, assembly plant, or anything other than look at a computer on a desk in an office park were 0). Sure there's some politics at the upper levels of a given organizational unit in a large company, but the pay tends to be pretty good and you'll have pretty good job security. IMHO large corps are great places to work when you are just starting out because your mistakes generally will just average out with everybody else.<p>Small companies/startups are such an entirely different beast it's night and day. You have huge impact in everything the company does. A single employee might account for 40% of the company revenue! The jobs are usually very versatile, you don't get stuck in a single task, you probably have to learn to do many different jobs -- you gain more experience than it looks like for a given unit of time compared to large co. For example, at large co, you might not be asked to work on contract negotiations until you've been there for 10 years. At startup you might do it from day one.<p>While large co's problems are mostly procedure issues, Startups are not without their issues -- and they're usually personnel problems:<p>1) Politics are magnified beyond belief. In large co, if my division manager was having a problem with another division manager, I might not even know. In a startup, it's like watching your parents fight over a family dinner.<p>2) Because everybody can have such a huge impact, screwups are magnified. A bad employee can literally sink a company. In a two person startup, that's 50% of the workforce.<p>3) There's very few checks against bad employees. One of the reasons large co <i>has</i> so many mindless procedures is to help control for bad employees. Startups don't really have a way to do that.<p>4) Job stability? Pffff...what's that? Pay is often not as good as large co, and benefits such as options or shares are just paper until you can buy beer with them.<p>I was once recruited to work at a very well funded startup that fell apart during salary negotiations. They wanted to make up for the low salary with catered meals and an all-you-can-eat pantry, dry cleaning and other benefits plus some options. I told them I'd rather trade those benefits for a pay check and would sign an agreement to never touch those benefits -- which wouldn't be hard since my position would require me to almost never actually be in the office where those benefits were offered. They backed out and it demonstrating to me that those benefits were simply flash and not worth the delta in salary they'd have to pay me.",1314882939

It was built by nerds and engineers. It has come a long way to allow people to make their HTML documents more expressive (to the point that they've become full application UI's...). But that doesn't escape the fact that this is a technical medium with specific technologies that drive those expressions.<p>You have to know this stuff if you want to be good, IMO.",1314882623

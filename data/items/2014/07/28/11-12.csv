I’m no longer able to write Android apps ever again, and my family and I can’t even use Google wallet to purchase from Google Play.<p>So much for programmer freedom. Apple is at least very explicit about its rules. Google seemingly lets you do whatever you want, but then bans you if you do something that they don&#x27;t like. Now of course one can say that the ban is justified, as author clearly misused the Play store and didn&#x27;t follow the guidelines.<p>If he did try to do that on the App Store his apps would be probably instantly rejected, but he would not be banned.

Does not a context struct that holds all the handler dependencies makes the code harder to ponder and test (because the dependencies of a component would be unclear).<p>Goji&#x27;s context is a request context, and only exists for the lifetime of the request. Re-populating it at the beginning of every request would be a significant amount of overhead, and it&#x27;s ultimately not designed for &quot;life-of-application&quot; variables. Request contexts like Goji&#x27;s (or gorilla/context) are best used for passing short-lived data between middleware/handlers.<p>You could ultimately create a series of smaller structs, but you would need a ton of types (and repetitive code) that satisfy http.Handler to achieve that.<p>Memory allocation with this approach is minimal: you&#x27;re only passing a struct pointer around <i>once</i> per request, which is about as good as it gets (better than a closure).<p>Testing with this approach is also straightforward: you can populate the appContext instance with your test sessions|database|etc when running tests, and your handlers operate as if they&#x27;ve been passed the real thing.<p>I&#x27;ve considered splitting out my handlers into a `handlers` package and the appContext struct/config structs into a `conf` package that handlers imports (and main initialises), and that&#x27;s probably something I&#x27;ll do in the near future since it&#x27;s an easy change.<p>It&#x27;s certainly not the one way/single best way to do things, but I&#x27;ve found that aligning to interfaces (like http.Handler) and leaning on structs as much as possible helps keeps things easier to reason and mock out later.",1406546100

It&#x27;s worth perhaps playing with, but not doing more until you&#x27;ve seen it work. You&#x27;re a small business. You&#x27;ve got a highly unsegmented market. In unsegmented markets, advertising is mostly about brand building. That works well if you&#x27;re Coca-Cola, but much less well for small start-ups.<p>Word-of-mouth can work well, but you&#x27;ve got to understand your customers, the networks, and the levers you can tweak to change rate-of-growth.

I would rewrite the text for the Ask, Reply, and Follow sections from the perspective of a power user. Imagine that you are simply a user of the site, you love it, and you are giving your friend an elevator pitch of why they should use it, too. As it is, you are just explaining the actual functions of the service, but you are not conveying the value proposition. After reading each little section, a prospective user should think ""Oh, nice, that solves a problem that I have."" To add another layer to this, be compelling and tell a story. You could even use a use-case example. For instance:<p>- Ask people which food truck is best in Midtown, NYC\n- Let people know about that amazing slice of pizza in Brooklyn\n- Keep track of activity in the East Village<p>3. The stream seems really wide. Maybe you can have two columns: one for questions and one for answers.

2939590,comment,2937696,2937696,2,0,fmw,,,"I'm betting my startup on Clojure, but it doesn't feel like much of a ""bet"". It is probably one of the least risky choices I've had to make and as a bonus to the technical benefits it is also a nice way to differentiate yourself. It is integrated with the familiar, mature JVM-platform and not that hard to learn as an experienced developer. Integrating with existing Java or future JVM code (e.g. Scala, JRuby, Groovy) is a huge plus, because you can start thinking about the right tool for the job instead of troublesome integration with legacy code.<p>As to hiring: I think you will have a harder time finding good programmers to work on boring problems in a boring language (e.g. Java). Picking a niche language would make your project more interesting, but you can also do other things to make the working attractive to good people, e.g. actively developing and maintaining open source libraries related to your project or allow them to rethink the way problems are solved in your industry. Seemingly boring problems can have very interesting solutions. It also helps when you offer good working conditions (e.g. possibility to work remotely and all the ""Aeron chair"" kind of perks you keep reading about on HN). Not everyone is right for the typical startup or Googler lifestyle. Some very good hackers actually prefer e.g. working from home so they can take care of baby to pulling all-nighters at Facebook.<p>This is all assuming you're a technical founder. If you are: go with something that you're not only passionate about, but that is also <i>the right tool for the job</i>. In my case Clojure fits best, because I need the integration with Java libraries like Apache Lucene, but in your case it might be Haskell or something else entirely. If you aren't a programmer yourself you should find a technical co-founder or early employee to make this kind of decision.",1314663732

I have been looking hard for some good best practices for Django.  There are some things I really like about Django.  I like it's readability and I like that new web developers can get up to speed rather quickly.  There is one area that I really wish were better though.  It is unfathomable to me that the norm (and best practice too apparently) is to cram pounds of code into single files (views.py, models.py, etc).  Now sure, it's Python.  You can break it up.  But the documentation and also what you see in Django projects perpetuates this insanity.  To break up your models, you must add additional glue code to each and every model (app_label) and if your app is large you <i>will</i> run into circular import issues.  This is just not practical for medium to large projects.  The best practice is to break up your project into applications.  Yes, that does help some but you still are going to want to break up an app's model, view, etc into multiple files.  Isn't this common sense? This and other areas of Django often makes me wonder: Why does Django make it easy to do the wrong things and hard to do the right thing?",1314663519

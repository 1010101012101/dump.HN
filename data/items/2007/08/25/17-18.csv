When they see it, then they want it, but before that they had no idea they would want it.  Case in point: the Iphone.  Scientists are not the answer.",1188064347

Shouldn't it be done by web scientists once and for all?  You could then use the results of their research as guidelines to determine the sort of app to build as well as its features/UI.<p>Also see:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/ShneidermanCACM6-2007.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/ShneidermanCACM6-2007.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://weblog.fortnow.com/2007/08/impact-of-facebook-platform-on-cs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.fortnow.com/2007/08/impact-of-facebook-platfor...</a><p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2205007948&topic=10970"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2205007948&topic=1...</a>",1188062408

The long tail is an interesting concept but why is the digg/reddit concept for a specific niche being so thoroughly flogged to death?  Is each site really grabbing big enough traffic numbers to make it a worthwhile pursuit?  <p>How can we break ourselves of the herd and copy+features methods of problem solving?  ",1188061890
46583,comment,45698,45698,0,0,pierredv,,,"I wonder about the kind of cognitive access a programmer has to their program once it's loaded.  Descriptions of walking through a building imply that moment-by-moment the programmer is only dealing with a subset of the problem, although the whole thing is readily available in long-term memory.  He's thinking about the contents of a particular room and how it connects with the other rooms, not conceptualizing the entire house and all its relationships at the same instant.  I imagine this is necessarily the case, since short-term memory is limited.  If true, this imposes limitation on the topology of the program, since the connections between different parts are localized and factorizable X when you walk out of the bedroom you don't immediately find yourself in the foyer. Consequently, problems that can't be broken down (or haven't been broken down) into pieces with local interactions of sufficiently limited scope to be contained in short term memory will not be soluble. Does this make any sense?\n",1188061386

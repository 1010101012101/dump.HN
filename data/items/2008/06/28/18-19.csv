A bus went through a building my father was in.  He was paralyzed but is fine now (this was before I was born).",1214678866

Life is rarely black or white, more shades of grey (can't remember where I read that).<p>Curious to know, what would you have said in the same situation, would you have said <i>we have 2 customers, one office, couple of customers, you would be third if we are lucky and hey guess what you are going to beta test our product.</i><p>Also, think about the second order effects of this deal not going through. Can you company make payroll without it? Is this deal the break your company has been looking for?<p>I did technical sales for 3 years, first real job right after school, the 2 things that really helped me sell were:<p>1. Tell the truth and<p>2. Put your customers interest before your company's<p>Good luck!",1214678529

This is actually one of the things that lawyers learn at law school...<p>What I would do is not listen to that.  They have their job (selling the software) and you have yours.  If they commit a fraud, you will not go to jail for it.<p>Do you hear the car dealership mechanic tell the customers the cars was NOT really driven by an old lady to church every Saturday?<p>Now, where you KNOW there is a fraud, you have a legal obligation to disclose it.  But fraud is very different than what you are describing.<p>I'd keep my mouth shut about it.  It might not be what you would do, but it does not sound illegal.",1214678191

This tells me that the unique trait that the millionaires had in common was mostly luck.<p>Ah sure. Does this mean hard work and taking risks is useless? Nope, because without hard work and risk taking you wouldn't ever get the chance to get lucky.",1214677200

230675,comment,230665,230665,0,0,cmos,,,"Sounds like a salesguy!<p>But seriously, it's a no win situation for you.  People will say a lot of things to close a deal, and even more to make  payroll.<p>So either your founder is:\n1. Desperate and willing to say anything, which means you might want to be cautious about the general health of the company\n2. Just a sneaky and over the top exaggerating salesguy (ok, a liar) because that's the only way he know's how to sell.  A shame, but you'd be surprised what salespeople will do to close a sale.  \n3. Has a 'corvette' complex.  His lies are not about what amazing things his product will do and how it will transform the customers business, which is more common for a salesperson to 'embellish'.  Instead, it's about how big and successful his company is.<p>If the company isn't healthy, and he's desperate, I'd figure out a way to either help or bail.<p>If the founder is just a liar, I'd go elsewhere.  The thing about liars is they lie about everything, sometimes for no reason about absolutely trivial things.  Life is to short to be around them.  \nAnd the saddest part is that his customer might be looking for a nice, small company who really wants their business and will jump through hoops to get it as they would be a highly valued customer, not just one of many.<p>If it's the 'corvette' complex then run.  He's starting a company to prove something to the bully in the playground.<p>And the bully is probably mowing lawns for a living.",1214676990

The theory goes -- if the orders come in, we'll build it.<p>Some people are naturally prone to exaggeration. Immaturity comes in to this as well -- once you've been around the block a few times you realize that fake posturing is easy for customers to spot.<p>If it's not investment related, it's not criminal. I'd have a word with the guy, something along the lines of you can't lie your way into trusting business relationships. After that, I'd make a call as to whether it was worth staying or not. I wouldn't.",1214676677

This is really bad policy, since due diligence will wipe those illusions clear.<p>If exaggerating features of a product, again bad policy, if you are selling something you don't have you are going to end up with an unhappy customer.\nIn this case exaggerating number of employees would be exaggerating features if he is selling support as a feature, bad policy to make promises that are not true.<p>Overall as long as they arent asking you to do anything you feel is not just, i wouldnt worry about it to much. \nThese lessons usually end up making teachers out of themselves.",1214676212

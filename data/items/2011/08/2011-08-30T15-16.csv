Given the mean and standard deviation of cash flows, you can figure the proper debt to equity mix.  But how well does the industry support that information for a particular project?  Natural gas plants have very stable output so are more easily levered up.  In a capital intensive industry, that's a very serious financing disadvantage.<p>This financing problem reflects a real economic problem.  Risk -- cash flow variability -- is a real economic quantity.  Failure to manage it causes real economic hardship and loss.  If 50% of the power supply is wind, and it's down due to weather, someone on the grid is going down.    Economically, the financing problem signals the importance of addressing that contingency.

truth a little bit. Since you only get three octets from GIS, it is
impossible to know ""exactly"" how many people visit your site. As for the

three octets, but the result would be generalized. The generalized data
would still be useful, but it would be lacking in resolution and
reliability compared to GeoIP on the full four octet IP address.<p>The approaching exhaustion of IPv4 in the coming years, and how, in
<i>practice</i>, it is handled could make a real mess of GIS. If your ISP
starts handing out IPv4 addresses in the private address space to
customers and does transparent PNAT, then GIS breaks badly for all
customers of said ISP. In the case of large ISPs, GIS could actually
make things slower.<p>The part I have no clue about is how GIS works with IPv6? I haven't read

All we can do is allow our own kids the reasonable freedom that they're entitled to I see many people doing so.<p><i>Books: as books move to electronic form they take on a different meaning. The words of the book transcend and the physical presentation is lost. On the Kindle every book is Twilight. In the real world the physical book has a meaning of its own: it's the book your wife gave you as an anniversary present, it's the book your late father got part way through and you dare not remove the bookmark he left in place, it's the children's book read and read until the pages are torn and worn. These physical remnants augment the book with personal meaning.</i><p>Speak for your own ebook reader - mine isn't filled with Twilight. Are more people buying Twilight than deep eternal classical philosophical works? No doubt, but that's not at all necessarily related to medium.<p><i>Sex: what happens when pornography becomes the default means of getting sexual pleasure. Does fantasy start to wither in the brain? If every fetish or desire is available (for free) at the touch of a button what happens when we are presented with a real other person to have sex with. And what's the cost of reality not matching screen fantasy?</i><p>Masturbation has always been the default means of getting sexual pleasure. It's assisted more now and I agree that's something to be cognizant of. But I remember wails a few years back of how rape was skyrocketing as corner convenience stores started selling pornography. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but my understanding is that rape, like most violent crime, is decreasing and is (in developed countries) at pretty low levels historically.<p>While we're theorizing, we could speculate that many peoples' sex lives are better now: as (widely-desired) taboos are normalized, more people get to engage in them. How many married couples have gone through life both wanting and desiring ""more"" (more pleasure, more intimacy, more ""dirty"", etc) but neither getting it because they both considered it off-limits? I've known far more couples whose sex lives have been improved by watching porn together than the opposite.<p><i>Making: as a child I had Lego, Play-Doh, and other toys to occupy my hands. Now imagine that these are all virtualized and I play with them on screen. There's no difference felt in my hands between them. No texture, smell and pliability of Play-Doh, no satisfying click of Lego, no hunt for the right coloured piece. If an infinite amount of virtual stuff is available does my imagination atrophy? If I can always find the right coloured, right sized Lego piece is this an advantage or a loss because I'm no longer forced to invent?</i><p>If you ever build a technological thing that makes kids not play with Lego and Play-Doh, it'll be because it's <i>so</i> immersive, fun, and imagination-stimulating that they don't want Lego and Play-Doh anymore. Every kid I see is surrounded by technology but still loves playing with these physical things too.<p><i>Children: as an adult man I'm now viewed by many to be a threat children. I can't be seated next to a child flying alone on a flight. I'm afraid to talk to a child in the street, and we've seen schools instituting policies against any sort of physical contact between children and teachers.</i><p>I agree: this is a huge problem. It doesn't seem, though, to be driven by technology but by its offshoot, media. I don't know what the answer is here. As above, I guess it's about making people statistically-driven rather than anecdote-driven. Good luck with that. Horror is more exciting than mundane news about the world being OK. As long as you have a free media, you're going to have this problem. Only possible remedy I see is a heavy educational emphasis on making statistically-based decisions.",1314719114

Pornos probably won't be the 'default' unless parents or sex ed programs put a big emphasis on 'when you meet someone you like, ignore them and find porn'. It'll still feel weird to want pornos.<p>Also:

Remember, they're not for profit, so reducing costs means nothing unless your budget is slashed.<p>Universities make money on grants, what is called the ""overhead"" -- it ranges from 40% to even more of all grant money received. In such an environment, it makes sense to charge as much as possible for the research. That's is exactly what most class A universities do.<p>And that is why the true stars of any university are the departments that charge more for their research. E.g., if you have professors that can justify building a hugely expensive particle physics' lab, that is a big point for you.",1314716451

It's actually the author's responsibility to submit it, but most publishers take care of it for you.<p>While this model is not without its problems, I think it's a pretty amazing start and has proved itself to be well worth the hassle. The NLM has put into place a great deal of infrastructure to make it easy for authors and publishers to submit their content, and the PubMed Central site itself is a great resource for researchers.",1314716418

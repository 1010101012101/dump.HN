831961,comment,831842,831894,0,0,mr_luc,,,"From another perspective -- for public speaking, I find that handwritten notes are indispensable because of the fingerprint they leave on my brain.<p>Hand-written notes don't need to be necessarily 'well-designed' in the same way a website does; you aren't going to be using them for the first time, so it's sort of like code you're writing for yourself that you know you'll never have to use after tomorrow.<p>But it's important that they be usable, in that they should answer ""where-am-I-going-with-this, how-does-this-tie-together"" questions for you. Because I participated in that tactile process of writing the notes, they can do that more effectively than something I typed; an interesting squiggle can express my intention to myself better than any comparably terse character on my keyboard.<p>I'd bet we take and make ugly, idiosyncratic notes for the same reason that we start out writing ugly, idiosyncratic code: it's memorable. (In lisp, 'idiosyncratic' code is close to idiomatic code ;)).<p>When I'm trying to think about something and am stymied, I need to doodle as well. Of course, there's very little transference with something that's ugly and idiosyncratic, so his notes do nothing for me and mine, likely, would do nothing for him.",1253367778

When there are no libraries to chose from, you pick a language that lets you write libraries quickly. Today we boldly go where many have gone before, and that means that we can benefit from technologies others have built. Standing on the shoulders of giants, and all that.<p>I'm arguing that if you want to run a business you should be pragmatic about the language you pick.<p>The second half of your post seems to consist of mere hyperbole and strawmen (COBOL? Right). If there is excellent rationale for picking an esoteric language, I'd love to hear it.",1253367462

I'm now more libertarian than I've ever been, but I temper that wonderful ideology with real world considerations. Historical events in the U.S. have caused such imbalances that simply making ""a level playing field"" now, in many situations, would never self-regulate everything back into balance solely from free market principles. Even Ron Paul who is against pork barrel projects ideologically ""brings home the bacon"" with pork projects for his district because that is part of the reality of how government currently works. He would take heat for staunchly passing on it all. The best he has been able to do is purposely draft pork into legislation he knows will pass, then vote ""No"" on it himself for symbolism only. If we admit to ourselves that the world we live in is not perfect (and unlikely to change soon) then we ask ourselves should legislation be sensitive to that or guided only by ideology?",1253366939

It seems that Apple has approved an app with a similar functionality in Skype for the iPhone. Is there something extra special about Google Voice that I'm not seeing? If the two apps are functionally identical maybe Apple is hung up on some aspect of the implementation. The whole ""Apple believed the application duplicated the core dialer functionality of the iPhone‚Äù sounds like it could be more of a technical issue vs a functionality / religion issue.

831936,comment,831817,831897,0,0,gizmo,,,"If you think Python and Ruby have extremely good libraries your standards are pretty low. CPython itself is stable and well documented, but it's frequently breaking backwards compatibility across versions. My production servers can't get anything newer than Python 2.4, and the servers are barely a year old. Python 2.6 libraries almost never work in 2.4, and when I do upgrade to 2.6 I know a lot of my own code is going to break. If I used Perl instead of Python this would be no issue, because Perl _is_ stable and reliable as hell.<p>In two years time most libraries will move to Python 3.0, and Django is unlikely to patch security issues for Python 2.4 by then. In other words, I either have to spend a week upgrading stuff that already works, or I'll have to use insecure libraries. I don't like those options at all. How can we write solid and stable software if we don't have a stable foundation to build on?<p>C++ code I've written a dozen years ago still compiles and runs fine. Executables still run when double-clicked. If I scpy a Django directory to a different server I'm __surprised__ if it just works. Doesn't that say enough?<p>Python exists 20 years now and the spec is still not stable. Any Python library written today won't run on the computers of tomorrow. That's a pretty big price to pay for a print() function.",1253365981

831928,comment,831468,831875,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Let me ask you this: is your opinion of dental insurance in any way related to your age and lifestyle? You have a strong opinion but, from an outsider, it seems that this is one of those, ""This works for me therefore it must work for everyone"" cases.</i><p>You're wearing your ""voice of reason"" face, without actually adding anything to the conversation.  I believe I've made my position pretty clear about why insurance for trivial expenses is a bad investment.  But I guess we'll go over it some more.<p><i>From seeing my own grandparents and parents expenses, I'd guesstimate most elderly spend upwards of $10-$30k on dental work from 60-80.</i><p>That's not even plausible for ""most elderly"".  My dad has always had serious dental issues, and is in his sixties now (as is my mom, though her dental issues didn't start as early as my dad's and have never been as serious).  <i>Combined</i> they spend less than $10k per year on dental care, without dental insurance.<p>Anyway, my position is, and will not change with age, that insurance should be for catastrophic events, not day-to-day expenses.  Insurance is designed to pay for the occasional rather than the regular.  Insurance is not designed to save you money...it is designed to help you get over the major bumps in expenditures that come up every now and then, by surprise.  Dental care is, generally, a regular, mostly predictable, expense.<p>Do you believe insurance companies are doing what they do at a loss?  Are they giving everyone more than they pay for?  If not, it's unwise to pay them for things you can pay for out of pocket, because in the long run, the insurance company <i>always</i> makes money.  Buying insurance is like gambling.  When it's something like health care, which can explode into hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of expenses, you <i>must</i> accept the bet; otherwise you're risking your health and risking bankruptcy.  When it's something like dental care, which can never be more than a few thousand dollars (cosmetic dentistry can add up to more, but that's never covered anyway), unless you expect to be the very expensive outlier, it's a poor investment.<p>If you like making poor investments, or if you are the outlier that requires frequent and expensive dental care, then you should get dental insurance.  Otherwise, you're paying for both your dental care, <i>and</i> the profit margin of your insurance company (and probably for some of the outliers that require a lot of care, since insurance distributes cost, as well).",1253365345

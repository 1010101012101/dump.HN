My experience is primarily with the megacorps.<p>If you are developing backend/service shit for other companies to use, then that is one thing, but I am thinking about in-house development.  Most megacorps aren&#x27;t software vendors; if they are developing software it is for themselves.<p>Regardless though, some megacorps deploying to windows doesn&#x27;t explain the practices of java shops that <i>don&#x27;t</i> deploy to windows.  It seems like portability just for the sake of portability, without any real purpose but with real added hassle.",1399579161

Most frequencies are &quot;owned&quot; by someone that has the right to transmit cell phone, radio, television, or other data across them.  You may recall, for example, that there was a big bidding war several years ago when some of the old UHF bands were sold off.  There are some open frequencies which you&#x27;re allowed to broadcast without a license on, these are the ones that your cordless house phone and such will transmit on.  Whether or not this is a legitimate reason for the closed source antenna code is beyond my scope of knowledge.",1399579145

It is actually very nice to have a simple unpack / installation application inside a Jar and to unpack the actual application from this Jar. In this way, the only requirement for unpack / installation is the JVM, which you already require to run the application itself. This is much more elegant than a platform dependent unpack / installation (installer binary or ZIP plus Windows Batch or a Shell script).",1399579112

And I hold all the cards--the user is very particular about watching my content, but probably not that attached to Netflix being the distributor. So it&#x27;s in my incentive to extract as much of Netflix&#x27;s margin as I can in return of granting an exclusive contract. If they balk, I can always set up my own distribution system, because I already have a huge marketing infrastructure, and because Amazon is renting out the actual hardware/bandwidth wholesale. Or I can license my content to an upstart Netflix competitor that charges (small dollar value) less. If customer&#x27;s aren&#x27;t particularly attached to Netflix per se, this competitor will quickly see users switch. Netflix is in a much weaker position. It can&#x27;t easily replace my content if I pull it.<p>I guess it works out for Netflix if users place a really high value in being able to get all their content from one place.

7717255,comment,7716022,7716910,4,0,7952,,,">>  We often engage in debates about whether Javascript/the web stack is fast   enough to use for various types of software. Performance improvements are treated as an inevitability; &quot;if it isn&#x27;t fast enough today it will be tomorrow&quot;. Similar attitudes hold for missing APIs and functionality. Most people don&#x27;t seem to really question what it really means for browsers to become more and more performant and more and more complex. The answer seems to be millions of lines of very complicated and low level C++.<p>Ironically, not needing to run high performance native code was a part of the original appeal of web apps.  Google maps worked well however old your graphics card was.  Gmail was secure even when viewed on an old version of IE.<p>If client side rendering is too slow, then don&#x27;t render on the client.  Cache the rasterized pdf as tiles up in the cloud and only read the actual document if the user selects text or zoom in.

In particular, most (non-Lisp) languages don&#x27;t let you mess with control flow much.<p>The result is that when writing FRP code, users have to manage two control flows: the &#x27;logical&#x27; control flow, which is expressed via whatever FRP library they&#x27;re using, and the actual control flow, which is the one provided by the language they&#x27;re in. Languages would need good support for source-to-source transformation, or, alternatively, allow the compiler IR to be manipulated by libraries.<p>From the little I&#x27;ve played with Haskell, it appears the monadic binding operator (>>=) lets you do this, and the user writes code in an idiomatic, imperative-like manner.

I used reactive-banana to do a school project last year, and it was ok but not on the level of Rx or ReactiveCocoa as far as I can tell.  There are a half-dozen or so other frameworks, and some of them are implemented differently from others as the research moves in different directions (different ways of representing events/signals, using arrows, etc).  Of course, for this specific use case (GUIs) there are similar issues in terms of implementations of GUI toolkits in Haskell (GTK? wx? some other half baked ones? and so on)<p>But back to your other point, sure you can write imperatively in Haskell and use IO and so on, but to really take advantage of the strengths of Haskell you need to write declaratively (i.e. functionally) and take advantage of the ways that helps you write things like GUIs (which are naturally declarative).",1399576657

There is no such standard interface for that, and no baseband maker would do it. Why take the responsibility for a backdoor that you don&#x27;t even control? There were no such things on the BB I&#x27;ve worked on. Of course if the BB CPU has access to the whole system memory then a bug in the protocol stack can be exploited to get its content. But that&#x27;s not specific to a carrier. And all peripherals embedding a CPU have the same weakness, it&#x27;s hardly specific to cellular BB.<p>Also, limiting the access of the BB CPU (or CPUs nowadays) to the system memory is perfectly possible: put the BB IP behind an IOMMU (SMU in the ARM world). Then just like a MMU can restrict a process access to the system physical memory, the IOMMU can be used to sandbox the BB and limit its access to the memory to its own dedicated range and nothing else. This makes sense even when the same company does the AP and BB part, for robustness. Just like complex applications are split into independent processes for fault isolation and security.<p>Instead of making exaggerated claims, it seems to me it would be more productive to put pressure on AP vendors for such SMUs to become standard. It&#x27;s not that common yet in the ARM world (each additional IP adds some cost), but it should and all master capable IPs should be behind one IMHO.<p>That won&#x27;t provide perfect security --- there could always be some backdoor. But in practice it would be good enough. And if there&#x27;s a backdoor the BB is nothing special: better to make the backdoor accessible through any external interfaces.<p>Sorry if I&#x27;m a bit blunt there, but as a person working in cellular I&#x27;m a bit fed up by all the (misplaced) paranoia. If you don&#x27;t like the telcos, fine, but no need to go all tinfoil hat.

But after reading this seems like a normal evolution of a well received project.<p>And Qt seems like is here to stay. So probably not bad decision from technical point of view too. It was nice when I used it.",1399575704

I pretty much had &#x27;xfce&#x27; as the solution there but can see the user model of Qt being a good component swap.<p>I&#x27;ll certainly build a VM with it to try it out, but my concern is that unless it gets some sort of traction it will just sort of fizzle out as folks graduate and move on to other jobs.",1399575693

I was really surprised when I read their filing, $4.7B in total revenue last financial year, $5.7B in the first 9 months of this financial year. Amazon + eBay in 2013 pulled in $33B in revenue. They seem to be processing a lot of transactions, but charging very little for it.",1399575660

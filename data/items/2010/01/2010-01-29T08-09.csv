I hope it hurts their sales and benefits more open platforms (probably Android) - that may be because I'm from the old world.<p>I like the dreams embodied by the Lisp machines and by OLPC. The idea that every part of the system can be easily inspected and manipulated resonates strongly with me. The freedom to tinker with a device can and does lead to new and amazing things the original creators never imagined. College kids playing with iPads will never invent Multifinder, and that's sad.",1264755569

The original ""hackers"" broke into computers and networks to play pranks on their collegues in the AI lab. Later ""hackers"" hacked the phone system to make free long distance calls. I find Paul Buchheit's definition of ""hacking"" the most accurate: find and exploit differences between the perceived rules and the real underlying mechanisms of a complex system.

It stores by an id, then the value is your object serialized as a protocol buffer.<p>The App Engine datastore allows you to look up by other properties than id because it indexes <i>every field</i> of your object in the background without you having to deal with it.

This is just Project HARP recapitulated -- and I'd be willing to bet that a significant amount of the data behind this came from the Iraqi superguns Bull designed.<p>It's not detailed in the report, but I wonder if they've considered the ""watermelon seed squeeze"" method (wherein the projectile flies through a combustible gas mixture in a weakly-sealed barrel tube, compressing the mixture with its nose cone, creating a combustion zone about two-thirds of the way along a ""spitzer"" type projectile, thus applying the expansive force inward against the tail cone). That would either create one hell of a high-speed projectile, significantly reduce the barrel length required -- or even allow tolerable accelleration from, say, a linear electric motor's initial shove by simply stratifying different gas mixtures along the launch tube to control the combustion velocity. (Cheap 1-mil poly film would maintain the separation of gasses well enough and fail safely.)<p>Man, I has to go into rocket surgery. Or maybe double-nought spying.",1264753259

1086058,comment,1085614,1085815,0,0,buster,,,"As a developer for Android devices, i must say this article makes me really sad. How can a developer be satisfied with limitations and just put the ""but it's how it is to be more secure"" stamp on it.<p>Let's see those 2 sentences that make really no sense:
""it can't just read and write willy-nilly to the file system, access hardware, or interfere with other apps. In my mind, this is one of the best features of the OS.""
and:
""As a developer, it's a bit sad losing the ability to come up with crazy plugins and daemons and system-level utilities, but I believe it's a tradeoff worth making.""<p>I've now owned Android devices since the G1 (the first), now switching to the Nexus One. The nerd i am i probably installed hundreds of those apps, that are not approved by someone. Not one of them did somehow brick my phone! The worst thing that happens is that apps don't do what i want, some even crash (but that's surprisingly rare). But still, they can run in the background, communicate with each other, etc.<p>So, why am i telling this:
If smart engineers can think about what a smartphone OS should be like, it will support save mechanisms for multitasking, for daemons and plugins. Behind Androids Interface are a lot of very neat concepts working.(intents/broadcasts, man, i love that concept!)<p>From what i can tell:<p>- iPhone OS is some stripped down Mac OS version, which probably has its deficits in some areas.  I believe that Apple just doesn't give us multitasking because it has heavy impact on batterylife or security (because the OS wasn't made for mobiles, in the beginning).<p>- When chosing between a _free_ development platform on Java, with Eclipse on every major platform and a subscription based development only with Mac OSX and a language that is basically used nowhere else (Obj-C)... well, the choice is clear for me.

If drugs were legalized, all that would be rolled into the `drug market'.<p>I don't do anything, but I still think the current drug policy is extremely sub-optimal. What worries me though, is when corporations get the green card to manufacture drugs like pot, all that untested engineering, preservatives and additives that are intended to make it more effective make their way into what people consume. If you think about it, mostly all current drug production is as 'organic' as it gets (as far as I know at least).",1236549238

Two telephone interviews, and no employment offers.<p>This doesn't sound like anything new to me. I did my first post-PhD search in 1996. Sent out 105 applications, got 5 interviews and 2 offers.

507566,comment,507266,507420,0,0,halo,,,"The reason no other language does that is because no other mainstream language uses newline and indentation to indicate blocks, which makes all general-purpose multi-line anonymous function syntaxes inherently ugly and non-Pythonic: where should the new block's indentation begin or end? I also regard it as a relatively minor problem as there's little cognitive overhead from simply naming a multi-line function, and I can see advantages in encouraging naming for complex functions.<p>Having thought about it for a couple of hours, I don't think there is any good solution for adding multi-line anonymous functions to Python. The suggested syntax feels non-Pythonic, is inherently unexpressive and difficult to read, only useful in a few select use-cases while not solving the holy grail of 'pleasant anonymous functions', and the single problem it's solving isn't common enough or big enough to need dedicated syntax and could already largely be solved with a named function. The fact it enables 'misuse' via Ruby-style iteration, going against Pythonic ideals of 'one way to do things', doesn't work in its favour either.<p>I don't think analogies with decorators are good either. The advantages of decorators is they transform something otherwise difficult-to-read and unexpressive into something easier-to-read and more expressive, whereas this makes something that's easy-to-read less expressive with the only advantage being terseness. Python, unlike other languages, focuses primarily on clarity over code length.",1236549099

All of the reasons why also apply to why you might not want to declare named functions in order to pass them to other functions.<p>Read some Ruby code that uses blocks for an example of how passing anonymous functions can become a very clear and natural idiom.  In Ruby, you can write your own simple control flow constructs in the form of functions that take a block -- in fact the idiomatic way to iterate through a collection in Ruby is with a function rather than a built-in control flow construct.<p>In languages like Lisp and Smalltalk, where functions can naturally take more than one in-line block, you can write <i>any</i> control flow construct yourself.",1236548794

The Boston area saw much of its population growth occur in the 19th century. The Bay Area saw much of its growth in the 20th.<p>So, the Boston area has had more time with its universities, rich people, and population base to develop. Yet Silicon Valley developed faster and came to be the bigger innovation center. Again, I suggest there's something else at work besides the presence of top-flight universities, rich people, and time.<p>What <i>is</i> interesting is that New England was a major force in innovation during the second half of the 19th century, helping to drive the industrialization of the US.

You want to build a product that people just keep coming back to? Here it is.<p>Sure, eventually, this market would become like food or, at best, cigarettes - with smaller margins, and not much innovation.

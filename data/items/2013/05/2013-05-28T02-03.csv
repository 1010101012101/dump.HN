Couple of questions for you...<p>1. AngularJS directives do not seem to conform to valid HTML. Does this matter to Google from a search perspective? I realize that single-page applications quite often have other SEO problems, but valid non DSL HTML templates seem like they would be of value for all the reasons you outline above.<p>2. I quite often see the following type of examples in an AngularJS tutorials. How is this different from Handlebars or Mustache? This still ties my template directly to AngularJS, no? Also, this is usually not understood by designers tools.<p><pre><code>    <pane title=""Localization"">

are alike.  Instead, it's that in the more
backward Islamic countries, Islam is essentially
all the culture there is.  And Islam is not
just a religion but is also into law, 
government, education, etc.  So, in such a country, Islam
is about all the culture there is and can
block, actively or just passively by default,
essentially all progress.<p>As you point out, there are still some differences.
But what is in common is that Islam, in whatever
flavors, is so strong, and not just a
religion, and essentially all the
culture there is, is able to block progress.<p>Look, to be more clear, the problem is not 
just Islam.  Instead, the Roman Catholics ran
everything in Western Europe for hundreds of
years, were corrupt, blocked progress, and
finally Europe got out of it, after religious wars,
etc.<p>The point is not that Islam is a bad religion,
even if it is.  Instead the point is that to
run a good society, need a good culture, and that
culture needs to come from much more than just
some religious clerics.  A religious state,
Roman Catholic, Islamic, or anything else, just
will not be a successful state.  In the countries
where Islam is the only culture, Islam needs
to shrink back to being just a religion, hopefully
one of several, and let the culture have other
inputs besides just religion.  Got it now?",1369709255

In this sense, the purchase of a first home is a risk reduction technique.<p>Second, market forces keep the cost of owning a home below the cost of renting a home (in most markets).<p>Third, there are substantial legal and financial benefits to owning at least your primary residence. Home sales are usually free of all capital gains tax; mortgage interest and property tax are tax deductible; and homestead exemptions exist in many states in the case of bankruptcy.<p>Finally, there are only so many other places to put your money. It is difficult for an employee of a corporation making in the low six figures (i.e. for a typical reader of this website) to shelter more than around $30,000 of earnings a year from taxation. Because of the advantages listed above, once you max out your retirement accounts and have an emergency fund set up, there is often no better investment than the purchase of a primary home. Also note that paying down your mortgage early is equivalent to investing your money in a savings account that earns a rate of interest equal to the rate of interest on the note (at this point, this rate is much higher than the rate you can earn in a savings account). This is on top of all of the other benefits.",1369708708

running the economy with a short leash and
running an aggressive military and foreign policy
at great cost to their domestic standard of living?
Is this just religion?  No.  But Islam is not just
religion and, instead, is often also economic, legal,
military, foreign policy, etc.  That's not new:  The
Roman Catholic church was doing that in Europe for 
hundreds of years.  They owned a major fraction of all
the farm land in France which has a major fraction of
all the good farm land in Western Europe.  They built
little things like the cathedrals, while the people
were living in, what, mud huts?  They built the Bishop's
Residenz in Wrzburg, awash in some of the fanciest art
and architecture in all of civilization -- not cheap,
and built by citizens in, what, mud huts?  The Roman
Catholic church was running everything.  E.g., to be
a king, had to have the Pope tap you on the head or some
such.  And they were corrupt.  So, they had the Protestant Reformation, religious wars, etc.  Lots of blood.  Finally they learned their lessons about religion.  In the US, we
borrowed those lessons -- the state will establish no religion; there will be separation of church and state; there will be freedom of religion.  Done.  Iraq, Iran, and
Afghanistan still have to learn these old lessons.<p>Sorry about the Shah; he was a pawn in the Cold War.  The
US had just finished WWII and, thus, took the Cold War
seriously.  We spent a LOT of money, and blood, winning

states, should all do the same thing:  Cool down.  Relax.
Embrace peace.  Get the clerics into religion only.
No more clerics measuring the lengths of women's skirts
or censoring the Internet.
Pump oil.  Enjoy life.  Then work on culture, good
government, education, technology, and a strong economy
for when the oil runs out.  And stop shouting ""Death to
America"".  Want nuclear power for electric power, taking the

So abundance of land is not a problem the West has traditionally had (not until colonization anyway).<p>Added to this, mortality has been high but population growth has been higher. The last century saw a dramatic rise in life expectancy (primarily due to a drop in infant mortality). The last 50 years has seen a dramatic drop in population growth (the lesson seems to be that the natural reaction to uncertain times by people is to breed more).<p>So the West is being crushed by the weight of supporting an ageing population from a system established at a time retirement was a rarity.<p>Add to this to overall trend of the last century has been one of urbanization.<p>And just to put the nail in the coffin, low-tech manufacturing has largely fled the West for the developing world where labour is cheap.<p>Our entire society seems premised on both population and economic growth.

5777628,comment,5777462,5777462,13,0,simonsarris,,,"(This is more of a response to several of the comments posted so far.)<p>I'd like to come to the defense of low-cost living but also acknowledge that (expensive) city living has its obvious pluses that people already in SV might be taking for granted.<p>I created a low-cost living situation while living in a big (old/pretty) house in New Hampshire by renting out all of the rooms to friends. My rent is ""free"" and utilities are split 5 ways ($50 per person in summer, $150 in winter. Heating the house is expensive). If you can stand living with other people, I think this is one of the better ways to bootstrap ""new job out of college"" money instead of putting a down-payment on a smaller home that might not bring in any cash.<p>The house just so happens to be the house I grew up in, which my father sold in 2005 and foreclosed on in 2010 (ultra-conveniently, the year I graduated from college). It needed <i>lots</i> of work, so instead of trying to (re)sell it for cheap I made a deal to fix it up while living in it for reduced rent. Three friends living there cover the rent.<p>The house may be worth more in the future than current rates, and certainly has its share of things-needing-fixing, and my friends pay below-market rent rates, so it seems like a good deal for everyone involved.<p>If I did not have such a house, I think I'd try to buy one and do the same thing. It's nice to have some communal society around after college. (I've planned other things in my life to try to re-create that, too, because I think its important and under-acknowledged.)<p>~~~<p>It's worth noting that there are downsides to living in a lower-cost-than-SV/Major City area. I don't have <i>any</i> programmer friends in real life outside of the people at my work (a <i>very</i> tiny company, and no one is remotely near my age (24)). That becomes a little problematic. I'm reminded of a quote from John le Carre:<p>> Coming home from very lonely places, all of us go a little mad: whether from great personal success, or just an all-night drive, we are the sole survivors of a world no one else has ever seen.<p>It's hard to talk about programming things and I think that's bad. I'm not around as many career-driven people as I'd like to be either and I think that's bad too. I end up spending a lot of time on the internet to talk about those areas of my interest. (And especially HN: I have a lot of affection for the repeated names in this place, even if we all tend to be a tad too negative. Consistent commentors still make a community and I'm thankful for that. Really.)<p>So it's a good setup. And while my salary isn't amazing it's more than enough for my area, and I love my walkable, lovable hometown in New Hampshire. But there's certainly something to be said for cities and high cost areas. I miss being around as many smart people as there were in college.<p>~~~<p>On a note actually related to the article, when I drove around western NY - went to college at RPI, near Albany and headed west for Craigslist ventures - the places I saw just seemed surreal. Some parts of western NY, if you were just dropped there with no context, you'd think to yourself ""A war must have happened here maybe 30 years ago"".

I'll be adding enough each month to have it paid off in 10-15 years.<p>For that, between the main level and the basement, I have around 2300 square feet that I can use as I wish, and I can modify it freely to suit my needs and wants.<p>But I would <i>never</i> buy a house in the bay area, at least not unless I had $20m+ in the bank.",1369706517

It took me a minute to figure out what you're actually doing here, but once I found the important bit on the page (""Setup your API Keys in OAuth.io""), I can at least be confident this isn't a glaring security concern. :) And yes, that was a legitimate concern when I first looked at it, given how little information is currently available.<p>While building <a href=""https://foauth.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://foauth.org/</a>, I had wondered if it'd be possible to do something like this, but it wasn't really my use case so I didn't really pursue it. I was more interested in people just trying to get access to their own data, so I built a solution for that side of things.<p>Still, I can speak from experience that wrangling 50+ OAuth providers into a single system is hard enough, and trying to provide a unified API to all of them is even harder. I'm not sure how many sites need to support that many sites, but for people like us trying to simplify the API for others, it becomes a pretty big necessity. As it is, <a href=""https://github.com/gulopine/foauth.org/tree/master/services"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gulopine/foauth.org/tree/master/services</a> is something of a living tribute to the differences between the various service providers.<p>So yeah, I'll be very interested to see where OAuth.io goes, and for anybody else here who just wants to get their own data (but not run your own service), you might also want to checkout <a href=""https://foauth.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://foauth.org/</a>.",1369706465

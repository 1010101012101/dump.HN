Future expectation of a commodity price can be expressed using futures and this is the generally the way in which a trader (or collectively, the market) expresses a view on the future price of the commodity.<p>And, combine that with arbitrage pricing of futures and you'll see that the current price of your commodity, in this case, the Dow index, includes these future expectations in its current price.",1235637316

495646,comment,495619,495619,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"There are two dilemmas with part-time programming. 1) I suspect that most employers prefer to attempt to extract all possible programming productivity from their employees, and ask/expect them to work more than full-time (SV startup bias,) so a part-time employee is really like a quarter or a third -- in management's eyes -- of a ""fully dedicated"" employee, and may not be worth 2) the worse overhead/productivity ratio of part-time programming. Unfortunately, many organizations have high process overhead for the task of programming.  This may be comprised of meetings, email and so on. A part-timer still has to be ""kept in the loop"", and the effort to do so does not scale back linearly with the scaling back of time worked.<p>Have you minimized your expenses?",1235636595

I'm already seeing more pop-culture references every day, and have friends I never would have expected to see on it following me.

495639,comment,495605,495605,0,0,gills,,,"I usually want that when what I really need is ordering but for some reason I want key-based/random access to the values.<p>I think Ruby added this recently.  I'm not using it yet.  A crappy hack can just dump the next/prev key into the value, plus a pointer to the first, and drop them all in a hash.  It's not really pretty, but would give you ordering if you want it.  Another hack is to store just the keys in a sorted list and keep the values in the hash (but this is equally inelegant to the list+hash hack and it has the same maintenance overhead).<p>I think most of the ordered-hashes are implemented with something like list pointers between the hash keys, but then again I haven't looked too closely under that kimono.<p>Edit: trees are also a good compromise.",1235635837
495638,comment,495334,495574,0,0,rudyfink,,,"I don't know about other people, but I have always heard what I'm writing in my head before I type it out.  Sometimes, especially if I'm a little distracted, this produces misspelled words that would be pronounced correctly or homonyms like ""hear"" instead of ""here"".<p>On the chance that it might help, I think the funnel is something like:<p>-ideas/shapes which are always moving around->selecting the appropriate/better/good enough one out of these by focusing on it more.  this always feels kind of like a sorter appraising different things bubbling up and sinking on the surface of a pool.<p>-this selected one at the fore gets structured to be said probably more precisely that feeling right before you actually say something.  if this is going well, little is lost between the thought and what comes out of the structuring, but sometimes the thoughts are much worse from the process.<p>-this structured thing gets more concrete as I touch type it and somehow grammar and punctuation get in there.<p>-this gets a look over as it is coming out for errors.  is it gibberish or not, is the grammar correct, do I like it.<p>Depending on what I'm concerned with different amounts of effort are going into those different sections.  I think the error gets put in pretty close to when it gets typed out.",1235635766

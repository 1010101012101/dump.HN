While luck plays a role in success, especially great success, it is well within the reach of many people to get ahead by adopting the right values. Furthermore, adopting these values will make the world a better place and reduce the burden on public services.<p>I know that non-judgment is the default modern moral stance. But there ought to be a way that we can advertise and support the values of self-reliance and respect for others without sounding accusative.

5174484,comment,5165819,5171179,1,0,flaviusb,,,"It isn't popular because of 'some kind of siege mentality'. It is popular because there is an observed structural power imbalance, which means that 'not joining a side' does not have 'no effect', as the 'silent' are assumed (by all involved, not just some actors acting in bad faith) to agree with 'the majority'.<p>Okay, think of it like this: you are not the only 'neutral' person out there. There are four sides. Side A, side B, side neutral, and side not-actually-involved. Side A will clearly win against side B, but clearly lose against side B plus some large (but not total) percentage of side neutral. Side not-actually-involved can have some influence on the outcome, but generally not much.<p>That is the kind of situation which I would claim things like the 'evil patriarchy' vs 'the not evil not patriarchy' are. So, there are several possibilities; if you are already a part of side a or side b, then you have already chosen a side. Whether you are part of side neutral or side not-actually-involved is pretty easy to determine: are you in the industry at all? If yes, then you are involved.<p>So, even assuming that you are involved, your unique help is in fact not <i>necessary</i> to the victory of the not evil side. Merely the help of many of the people in your reference class. In which case, if you choose not to help side b, you have indicated that you prefer side a winning over helping side b; this is not quite the same as preferring that side a win, but it is enough that 'neutrality' is usually taken by everyone involved (including other neutrals, except for you for some reason) as 'weak support for the structurally powerful/status quo/clear majority position'.<p>Does that clear things up at all?",1360115611

And I think I know what the solution has to be: class-action defense.<p>What's going on is this. They have a pretext to sue, which is not good enough to win, but is good enough to keep the case from being dismissed on summary judgment and to keep them from being ruled vexatious litigants. They use this pretext to start hundreds or thousands of copies of the same case, against different defendants, achieving economy of scale. If the case proceeds, the defense has to spend much more (even if they win), because they have no such economy of scale. So they're forced to settle instead.<p>But suppose one defendant could force the patent troll, in a pre-summary-judgment motion, to reveal the identities of everyone else they'd threatened with the same patent. That would allow the defendants to pool legal costs, merge all the cases into one courtroom, and have a fair trial, rather than just being extorted.",1360115435

5174470,comment,5174334,5174334,3,0,rabialam,,,"Very interesting take, especially at the end in enumerating privileges. I had a similar experience with my own Mom's Macintosh SE being the gateway to my life in tech, and I don't know what I would done if she didn't introduce me to that at such a young age. I have been so lucky. Born in the States (even though mom's a foreigner which was a blessing in a lot of ways on account of the work ethic she tried to bestow upon me), college educated male with tech skills that were developed sort of circumstantially but very intensely at a very early age -- I feel so lucky, as if I ""had a winning lottery ticket"" for sure. And now, even as I am finally able to enjoy the the excitement and passion of a career that is exactly what I want to be doing -- I find myself so often feeling so incredibly anxious about why I am not doing more to help others gain access to my world. Frankly, I think that it's rare that (and sad that it's rare that) we have open discussions in the tech community about that word ""privilege"" where there isn't an INTENSE amount of denial, apathy, minimization, skepticism and disbelief (which, sadly, are some of the most common results of such privilege). For me, this post was a breath of fresh air that adequately expressed a lot of what I feel everyday -- I feel so lucky, but I feel so torn. Yes, I think I worked really hard to make good on my skills and develop them. No, I do not think that makes the world even remotely fair. Yes, I still feel like it is so unfair that in a lot of respects it is almost CERTAINLY a lottery. Yes, it continues to bother me that I feel sort of powerless about that divide, but yes, I would like to bridge that. Perhaps part of that is to start blogging as you have. I think that's what I like so much about this post: you are really leading by example in a way that is rare and yet quite needed. Good on you, and I look forward to reading more.",1360115349

5174467,comment,5168401,5169585,4,0,ilaksh,,,"Hello.  So-called 'conspiracy nutter' here.<p>The fact that someone believes something which you do not believe does not mean that they have a mental health problem.  If that were the case, we (atheists) could say that there were a billion or more insane Christians out there.  But everyone knows someone who has religious beliefs.<p>Everyone, no matter how mainstream their opinions, has a worldview which is comprised of a set of beliefs.  Everyone.  Now, it is just the nature of beliefs that rational arguments and evidence do not readily alter them.  No matter how widespread, or how fringe the belief is, or whether you judge it to be 'crazy', or whether the belief has a scientific basis.  Those are the default nodes in your cognitive framework.  You just don't change them very easily.  Any more easily than I change my beliefs.<p>One thing that you may not realize, or perhaps may not accept as fact due to your own worldview, is that the 'conpiracy theorist' label has been historically, and still is, a tool used to suppress dissent by ridiculing opponents who accuse an establishment of wrongdoing.  Here is a Wikipedia article about it.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_abuse_of_psychiatry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_abuse_of_psychiatry</a><p>> As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions code menaces to authority as mental diseases during political disturbances.<p>>...In the 1970s, Martha Beall Mitchell, wife of U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell, was diagnosed with a paranoid mental disorder for claiming that the administration of President Richard M. Nixon was engaged in illegal activities. Many of her claims were later proved correct, and the term ""Martha Mitchell effect"" was coined to describe mental health misdiagnoses when accurate claims are dismissed as delusional.<p>I anticipate that most people with mainstream beliefs in the US would assume, based on their worldview, that political abuse of psychiatry only applies to other countries, or to other times.  I think this is wrong, and part of the general myth perpetuated by the establishment that it rarely (or at least, not in contemporary times) does anything that can't be morally justified.<p><a href=""http://conspiraciesthatweretrue.blogspot.com/2007/01/list-of-proven-conspiracies-from.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conspiraciesthatweretrue.blogspot.com/2007/01/list-of...</a>",1360115312

When we do teach Rails, we stay very close to the framework itself and ask students to build things like authentication from scratch. After they get the core of Rails under their belt, that's when the fun really starts - we introduce comprehensive testing materials, advanced Rails topics, service integrations, complex application workflow, git/github based team collaboration and production app deployment and maintenance concerns.<p>It takes a while to build up all this from the ground up - but we found this being very effective in pushing people to an intermediate level and build up confidence along the way.",1360112720

On the other hand, this prevents me from finding a site I worked on 15 years ago, because the current domain has it blocked.",1360112711

(2) The meta-analysis only looked at SSRI's. Remeron is <i>not</i> an SSRI. And most of the people that I know who are satisfied with their antidepressants are not taking SSRI's. (3) This is a single study. Individual studies are often contradicted by further studies.<p>From my experience with side-effects, I would not recommend anti-depressants for anyone who was not suffering from a major depression anyway. The risk is not worth the reward for just being down in the dumps. For mild cases of depression, it's not even clear to me that accurate diagnosis is possible. How can doctors accurately differentiate between mild depression and just being sad due to unfortunate life circumstances? Until we can do brain scans or blood tests to identify depression, I don't see how they could. And without the ability to make accurate diagnoses for mild cases, it's not clear to me that the data on drug effectiveness for mild cases can mean much anyway.",1360112669

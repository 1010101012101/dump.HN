Most people get that on forums that discuss such things - ""proven"" in these things simply mean their theories checked out. 
We'll never know what the universe really ""IS"" - we only know what we percieve, directly or indirectly,and what we can predict.  It's still turtles, all the way down.<p>- not literally that it's an absolute truth - that's impossible, as you said, other than in mathematics.",1341356064
4196645,comment,4195208,4195208,8,0,ender7,,,"So, I'm not a huge fan, but definitely an interesting attempt. Some commentary, because why not:<p>- As others have noted, the ""moonshot"" imagery is a good idea and manages to seem classic and futuristic at the same time.<p>- The wordmark is a little cliche (lowercase sans wooo), but it looks okay. I like the beveled foot of the t, which provides echoes of the slanted logo, but feel like it's just an afterthought right now. I wonder what it might have looked like with a few more bevels.<p>- The slate shape is nice, but it's not an uncommon shape. In order to avoid confusion you're going to need something to make it extremely recognizable. A strong color identity will help a lot here. Your system of positioning the log above the top-left corner of text also helps, but only if there's text around. You know you will have succeeded when the demo image of the woman in the orange jacket is unquestionably your logo and not a random part of the jacket design (which it could be mistaken for at the moment).<p>- The derived logos (Windows, Office) are a little confusing. Why is windows two slates? Why are the slates fighting in Office? Why doesn't metro have any slates / why is it even up there with Windows and Office? To create a family of logos you actually need a sense of ""family"" -- this just feels like the first two things that popped into your head.<p>- It's still a little unclear whether the slate logo is also Microsoft's logo, or whether the corporation itself will just use the new wordmark. Why is the slate logo used on the Windows Phone? Shouldn't it be double-slates?<p>- Maybe it's just my screen, but your color palletes for metro don't look that great. Dark blue on black is hard to overcome; the teal is too light compared to the white text; the black theme is hard to distinguish from the black background.<p>- I really, really like the combination of screen reflection and slate logo that you see in the ad for the Nokia phone. You see those fake reflections on any ad for a device with a glass screen. I think you could turn that into an enduring visual language for ads.",1341356055

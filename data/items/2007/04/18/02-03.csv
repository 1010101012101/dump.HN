I've often wondered how all the stuff there is organized. New essays we can find out about, but how is one to know when something else is added to this index?<p>There's no date on the link, so it's not clear how recent it is.",1176865080
13940,comment,13924,13932,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Would you elaborate on what you mean by ""similar goals""?<p>I'm not a MySpace nor a Virb user, but I'm under the impression that Virb is a ""MySpace killer,"" erring more on the social networking side, rather than music sharing.<p>If you look at it that way, I would think it makes sense to pack a lot of auxiliary features (blogs, video, music) revolving around a central function (friend tracking). It's like creating an amusement park. After you have people coming in, you put rides here and there. iJigg would be more like an open concert hall. Does that seem right?",1176864594

13938,comment,13660,13727,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I think one of the biggest factors fueling the initial bubble was the misconception that the costs of doing business online would rapidly drop to zero, so it didn't matter if companies were spending way more than they were making in the short term. The bubble burst because investors figured out that:<p>A) The cost of hardware wasn't dropping to zero because companies needed to upgrade hardware to keep up with the competition, rather than doing the same thing at a lower cost.<p>B) By far the biggest costs of doing business were the people and not the hardware, and those costs were going to remain fixed.<p>Do you see any underlying ideas fueling this bubble that will ultimately be proven false, leading the bubble to pop? To my thinking this reunion.com thing is just a case of stupid business, rather than some underlying common fallacy that's pervading the web. (The closest thing I can think of is that we are all just overvaluing the ability of startups to create wealth, but if this is true then the bubble also has a lot more room to grow before it pops.)",1176864185

Google just gives each project a certain number of slots to fill. So at least in 2005, it was the Open Source project that picked which applicants to fill their slots with.<p>How would Google be able to judge the worth and merits of each proposal to the OS project anyway? :)<p>I also did <i>not</i> mean that being an established Open Source project meant that the project automatically gets SoC slots. But it does seem to me like established Open Source projects can pretty easily get slots for SoC. In other words, Google isn't too picky, nor are they only looking for contributors to the projects that Google finds useful.",1176863973

The $200 fee applies to LLCs, Limited Partnerships or General Partnerships.<p>You're a C-Class Corp right?  Therefore you pay the corporate franchise tax.  If you go to the link on the page entitled ""Franchise Taxes Here"":\n<a href=""http://corp.delaware.gov/frtaxcalc.shtml"">http://corp.delaware.gov/frtaxcalc.shtml</a><p>it tells you what it should be.  Your fee will vary depending upon how many shares you have outstanding, but I'm guessing you have less than 3,000 therefore it will be $35.",1176863827
13935,comment,13575,13925,0,0,lindsayrgwatt,,,"I'm interested that you'd even consider a salary-only job.  Why would you ever work for a startup if it was only salary?  (Honestly-I'd like to hear your opinion) Wouldn't you want equity?<p>Also, let me ask you why I'd ever want to hire you on as salary-only; you'd have no incentive to stay (I'm a big fan of splitting the equity pie to make sure everyone shares in the upside and have incentives aligned).<p>Thoughts?",1176863455
13934,comment,13608,13608,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I have a proposed unifying theory that covers the beauty of both simplicity and excess.<p>Humans appreciate intelligence. Showing how much you can do with so little is one way to show intelligence. For example, if you can create a brilliant artistic masterpiece with only a single line then this is clearly a work of amazing intelligence. The other easy way to demonstrate intelligence is by doing the absolute most that you can with every resource you have available to you. This explains the beauty of things like H2G2, where the beauty comes from incorporating all of these random plot elements and linguistic tropes into these beautiful sentences and descriptions.

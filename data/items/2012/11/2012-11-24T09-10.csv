Even when drug money can't be spent freely or things done openly. If drugs are legal then 100% of the money is available freely to a handful of people from cartels, who may even own a significant % of Mexico's Gdp. I'm imagining a situation similar to Italy, there are articles on the Naples trash monopoly owned by the mafia for example. With so much money, cartels can easily own larger industries in Mexico and I'm not sure that's a good thing.",1353750635

Essentially, we're pissing away our tax money to pay for DEA agents and their expensive toys, who, in turn, don't provide any real service.</i><p><i>This drug war is expensive, it costs dollars and lives. It's trivial to end it, but it's not happening. Too many dollars at stake.</i><p>I was with you until this, not because I disagree but because I think it's an irrelevant issue. There are many examples of enforcement/regulation wings of the government being rolled back when the political tide turned against them. The issue is that law enforcement expenditures, like military expenditures, are pitched as a response to public fears.<p>If you talk to older generation, suburban family folks who support criminalization instinctively, their number one stated concern is, in my experience, that they are afraid of drug-related crimes -- robbery, burglary, theft i.e., crimes being committed to support a habit (so the hypothesis goes). Now the obvious response to that is to point out that those things happen now, but then you are engaging an issue of the heart by attacking a point made in their head. This will probably segue into an argument about stiffer criminal penalties -- the exact opposite of what we want -- because <i>the person is still afraid</i>.<p>DEA toys don't figure into this argument, even if that is the end result, so if you want this to happen before that generation is old and gone you have to have an argument that addresses the core concerns people actually have. If you have to talk about the DEA, even if you are technically correct, I doubt anybody can be swayed by such an argument -- it's all cerebral and doesn't address the central issue, which is fear.<p>That's MHO anyway.",1353750609

Ignoring things (for the purposes of measuring innovation) from the last 5 years like Google Chrome, self-driving cars, street view, knowledge graph, instant search, public transit directions (for which a whole standard for encoding transit directions was created and implemented) etc, simply because they're not new product categories (with the exception of the cars) just seems silly</i><p>Well, true I have to count Maps (Earth/Street View) to Google's innovations. It's an important thing that millions use everyday, and that rules it's field.<p>Chrome, OTOH, is just Apple's webkit work with a sandbox. Not substantially better than either Firefox or Safari. If we count that as innovation, then sure, Apple put out 2 versions of it's OS and several iOS versions with hundreds of new features, the new iMac, etc etc.<p>As for the glasses and the self-driving cars, when we actually see them in the market I'll count them as innovations. Heck, I'll count them as innovations for Google even if someone else brings them to the market. As it is, they don't amount to much better than vapor(hard)ware.

I think the people at Facebook feel they have more structure. This is desireable for some people, less so for others. But we're not talking about too much structure, just a sense that things are a bit better organized at Facebook.
That being said, everyone I know at Google seems much happier. The company seems to place a high priority on building the self-esteem of its employees, and reducing the many minor humiliations that are part of working for anyone especially a big company.

Many people seem to come to the conclusion that this is automatically somehow representative of bad behavior, but I strongly disagree. Just because something is covered by copyright and is on MegaUpload, does not automatically make it infringing, even if some of the links to it might be.<p>Consider that someone legally backs up his own files to MU and never shares links to them with anyone. Then someone else uploads the same content in an infringing manner. Should the first guy with his completely legal backups have his stuff deleted just because someone else did something infringing with the same files? He most certainly should not. Assuming that all links of the same file that was uploaded are automatically infringing is basically ""guilty until proven innocent"", and is very much not the way they should be treated. Hell, I have music and other copyrighted content perfectly legally backed up in the cloud myself, and I sure as hell wouldn't want to see it deleted just because someone else might have used the same service for infringing sharing of the same files. (and what cloud provider <i>wouldn't</i> want to optimize their service to only have one copy of each file in their back-end instead of wasting space with duplicates?)<p>And, of course, this is very different to something like child porn, which is <i>always</i> illegal under US laws (where the stuff was hosted in case of MU). There can be no ""non-infringing"" use there, so it makes sense to delete all and every link to it. Not so much with just copyrighted content. And as we also know, deducing whether something is infringing or not isn't very clear cut either, like with Viacom issuing takedowns for Youtube videos its own employees had legitimately uploaded for marketing purposes.[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/18/youtube-viacom-secretly-uploading-content/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/18/youtube-viacom-secretly-upl...</a><p><i>Viacoms efforts to disguise its promotional use of YouTube worked so well that even its own employees could not keep track of everything it was posting or leaving up on the site. As a result, on countless occasions Viacom demanded the removal of clips that it had uploaded to YouTube, only to return later to sheepishly ask for their reinstatement. In fact, some of the very clips that Viacom is suing us over were actually uploaded by Viacom itself.</i>",1353749963

4824979,comment,4824593,4824593,7,0,pbrook,,,"Hey I'm Peter Brook, an engineer at Facebook hacking our Android code. Reading over some of these responses, I feel like there are some popular misconceptions about Facebook that are being repeated and I wanted to jump in and share my own personal experience.<p>I was an intern at Facebook in the summer of 2011, and joined full-time as an engineer in the Seattle office that winter. I joined part way though my junior year of college, and though a balance of time I am managing to graduate this quarter. During my (non-Facebook) undergrad, I was completely in to robotics research. I had done research my entire undergrad and was sure I was going to graduate school for robotics. In fact, when I got my full time offer, I basically said thanks but I know I am going to grad school. A week before my deadline expired, I completely flipped and accepted the Facebook FT offer. There were several reasons why, but these are the relevant bits:
People. Facebook is a company focused on humans. My intern manager and my team manager as an intern were both outstanding human beings. I really, truly felt that they cared about me and about the direction that Facebook was going. This manifested itself part way though the Summer when I and some other interns proposed that the interns should do a Reddit AMA about what it was like to be an intern at Facebook. Both my intern manager and team manager were really excited about the idea and helped push it for approval. We got push back, and they advocated for us to the point where I wanted to hug them for caring so much. This initial effort finally did manifest itself in (so far) several Facebook team lead AMAs. At some level, seeing that my manager cared so much made me feel like Id be okay in life if I just ended up next to such a quality guy.<p>Personal growth. I really enjoy learning new things about life. I knew that Id learn a whole bunch of CS in grad school, but Facebook offered opportunities for many different kinds of learning, and in the end that potential for a diversity of learning experiences was really attractive. Boy was I not disappointed. I was immediately encouraged to begin interview training and have now interviewed dozens of candidates. I asked if I could mentor a new employee through Facebooks bootcamp process and immediately got a sure, go for it! response. I asked if I could mentor an intern, and got the same response. Less than 1 year after being an intern, I had the opportunity to mentor one! These sorts of experiences pushed me to learn all sorts of new stuff, all while being surrounded by extremely competent mentors that could help me whenever I asked to chat.<p>Impact. This one gets hyped a lot, but its kind of ridiculous and hard to oversell. There is the opportunity for individuals to have crazy levels of impact at Facebook. I am the lead engineer on a critical component of our infrastructure, and all I had to do was step up and take the responsibility (and execute effectively). In meetings and company wide, we are very open to anyone stepping up and pitching their ideas. Of course, the idea might get shot down, but theres still a lot of opportunity to learn Facebooks product strategies, understand them, and then suggest and implement improvements to those strategies.
Technical work. This is a minor thing, since it is clear to anyone who has worked at Facebook, but we solve a lot of very hard problems. As an intern, for my intern project, I wrote a statistical analysis service in python that communicated with a backend ML service written in C++, and was controlled via a thrift interface by a PHP frontend I wrote, which updated the client side periodically (since the analysis took a while) via js/ajax. Nobody really held my hand through this (although Im sure I could have gotten help if Id asked more, and asking for help is definitely a skill I should get better at), these were just the technologies we had in place and so I just made it happen. In my FT work, I am hitting everything from network optimization to intricacies of Android to how to create maintainable APIs.<p>That said, both of these companies are stellar places to work. I've heard great things from my roommate who interned there, and I have close friends at both companies.",1353749500

4824964,comment,4824593,4824593,7,0,pedram_keyani,,,"My name is Pedram Keyani and I'm on the Site Integrity team at Facebook. I worked at Google from 2005 to 2007 and have worked at Facebook since then. The comparisons aren't going to be completely fair because I am comparing a younger smaller google of 5 years ago to the Facebook of today but I'll give you my perspective on both places and try to stay as fair and balanced as possible but please keep in mind that I'm obviously biased since I left one to go to the other.<p>Spoiler alert: My answer is at the bottom<p>--- My high level on Google ---
Google hires lots of smart people and puts them in a technical environment to be incredibly productive. Working on a social product (orkut.com) I always felt like a bit of an unloved step child. We weren't considered core and never got much attention during company meetings even though orkut was hitting some amazing page view stats. It's a hard core data company and social was never part of their DNA. This will take them time to do assuming the Google social antibodies don't win.<p>--- Facebook - the mission ---
We, to oversimplify it, are building technology and products to help people share their lives and connect with the people that matter to them the most. Love and belonging are right above safety and security in Maslow's hierarchy and that is what we all come to work to build for. If you don't believe in the mission of the company then the rest of this is going to be meaningless for you.<p>--- Facebook - the good --- 
Facebook hires really smart people who want to get stuff done. The entire company is set up around giving each person and team as much autonomy as possible and removing barriers to turing ideas into reality. It sounds like hyperbole but our first company value is ""move fast and break things"" because we know that most ideas that sound great are, in reality, crap and spending 6 months to design something without testing your core idea is a fool's errand. At Facebook, code wins arguments so we solve debates by building things quickly and throwing them over the fence to get data and then iterate to improve it or learn that it was a bad idea.<p>As a smaller company (I think we are 5K right now) building something with such a big surface area we have to be lean and scrappy. Where some companies have a team of 20 people working on something, we have 2 people. It sounds scary (and it is, see ""the bad"" section below) but it pushes people outside their comfort zone and frankly that is the zone we should all strive to always spend some time in because that is where you learn and grow. In my time here I have built a bunch of things I had no qualifications to build but with only 50 engineers I couldn't wait for us to hire the right people. In the process I built, watch fail, rebuilt, and learned from many ambitious projects. I'm proud to admit I've brought down a number of Facebook services in the middle of the night and come in the next day, not to a pink slip, but from my manager telling me how well I fought the fire I caused and then we work through the design to improve it.<p>This is a company that practices radical transparency. At our weekly Q&A where Zuck stands in front of the company and has to answer any question employees throw at him and if he gives a bullshit answer then the rest of questions will be people calling him out. He sets the standard that the entire company lives by, it's part of the reason why we get things done so blazingly fast despite our tiny size. Another reason we operate so quickly is that we don't build bureaucracy as a response to mistakes and as a result decisions get made quickly. Another benefit of the radical transparency is that each team communicates very openly about their goals, projects, and progress which again makes communication and collaboration really fast.<p>I could write for hours about hackathons at Facebook but the most significant bit is that it creates a time constrained environment that really brings out the best in people.<p>--- Facebook - the bad ---
Not everyone is meant to be put outside their comfort zone. It is a scary place at times and I've seen some good people just not hack it and leave. This is an incredible place to build amazing stuff but it is also a demanding one. We don't measure by effort, it's about what you can get done and the impact you can have.<p>We are a well known company that a lot of people write about and the articles about us are of two flavors ""Mark Zuckerberg, man of the year"" or ""Facebook is destroying society"". A lot of new grads come here and get really down when they read bad press about us and don't have the context that the press is an industry like any other and they want page views and no one reads a vanilla article. I try my hardest to remind new employees of they realize that the news is not reality, what we are doing is reality.<p>Working on something that over a billion people use also means that you can't change the font size without upsetting tens of millions of people. If you work at Facebook for more than a month you are going to experience people being outraged over changes we make and often times publicly claiming we have made the change for a nefarious reason. Again it's heartbreaking to hear but unlike the news we can't simply ignore this. We have a responsibility to listen to feedback and try to pull out the good from the people-just-dont-like-change. It's not always easy to do but it's an important part of building a service that so many people care about.<p>--- My advice ---
Pick the place where you are most passionate about the mission and think you will be excited to wake up and go to work at. hell, pick whatever company/startup/project/organization that makes you want to sleep less just so you can do more.

The point is the potential to get steam from water at lower temperatures, in less time.<p>If you are dealing with A LOT of water (if you were to scale this to power-plant scale), you are dealing with large 'thermal mass'. This means you need a lot of heat over time to raise all the water to a high enough temperature to create electricity.<p>If you run a power plant, you want flexibility. You want to switch on your power plant fast, and then shut it down when you want, without cost. This lets you speculate on the electricity market, and be more available if there is a sudden spike in electricity demand. If you're dealing with large thermal mass, you don't have this flexibility.<p>Also lots of advantages of lower cost - not needing heat exchangers etc but I'll leave it there.",1353748642

Ok, this might make sense, if she had him scapegoated before parliament or had him arrested for conducting illegal operations. But no, she gave him to hostile foreign operatives. So unless the new director was trying to buddy up with the enemy, how the fuck would that smooth things over? Sounds like she's just a traitor. Even if it did make sense, she still basically said she ended his life so she could keep her job.<p>Later on something even worse happens. She was testifying before a panel, once again trying to keep her job, and she receives information about an imminent terrorist attack. So, having this information, she proceeds to let the attack take place, because as she said, she was afraid it would make her look bad in front of the panel. As a result, several people are killed, but everyone pretends not to notice that it was entirely her fault.<p>Other than the fact that her character turned into a terrorist mole, it was the best bond film in a long time.",1353748167

Someone has a mockup of some tweaked and dumbed down UI that streamlines some common tasks, and shows it to a newbie user. It tests well, because the stuff they are measuring is the stuff they implemented (""How well can someone find the internet browser? Easy, it's a big fat button! Yay, win.""). Then it hits the real world and edge cases and inconsistencies abound, and you don't have the weight of experience and history to fall back on because you have a radical new UI philosophy. So the rough edges persist longer than they should and people complain, and it harms your brand in the meantime. This kind of stuff requires real investment, and investment is hard to come by in the FOSS world.",1353747909

They are probability distributions over the same space.

I think it is virtually impossible to find a meaningful axis among which all of one company's jobs strictly dominate the other's.

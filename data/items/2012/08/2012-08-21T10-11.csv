Their business plan is usually structured around people not actually using the service, and those who do use the ""Unlimited"" option usually end up either (A) being rate limited, or (B) having a conversation with the hosting/data provider to encourage them to transition elsewhere.<p>What's exciting about this, is that Amazon doesn't care _how_ much data you send them - presumably they've priced this so it's profitable at any level you wish to use.  It's a sustainable model.  Services like TarSnap/Arq will likely adopt this new service (Possibly offering tiered backup/archival services?).<p>I have (close to) zero doubt that Amazon's Glacier Archival Storage will be available 5 years from now at (probably less than) $0.01/Gigabyte/Month.  They are a (reasonably) safe archival choice.   Now that light users (<300 Gigabytes) have a financial incentive to move off of CrashPlan onto Amazon - it further exacerbates the challenges that ""Unlimited"" backup providers will face.

Heck, some people even consider lambdas innovative, even though they were invented before computers.<p>If you mean the most widely used parts of computer science research, like algorithms and big-O notation, then it seems pretty clear that those won't become archaic any time soon.<p>If you mean the syntax and libraries of today's popular programming language, then well, duh. You shouldn't be asking about this stuff at interviews in the first place. Your own argument perfectly explains why.",1345543328

Let's say you have your student project's folder shared with two other colleagues. You take a few days off, use your PC for casual browsing, meanwhile your colleagues are working on the project. At the end, one of them (who doesn't quite understand how dropbox works) deletes the files while the other is still working on it and dropbox gets confused. Your PC gets synched at a moment where you don't notice. Come back from your holidays and you will have a nice surprise waiting.",1345543244

If you think ycombinator companies are overvalued, you should contact the investors and give them odds against the ycombinator startups successes, and it would be in their best interest to take you up on it as a hedge.<p>In general terms, if you claim to have knowledge of a mispriced asset, there always is an implied economic action you should take to make money off of your unique knowledge.",1345543217

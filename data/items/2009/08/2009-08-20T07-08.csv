774615,comment,773447,773447,0,0,bad_user,,,"I also did my own URL routing ...
<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/django-catalyst/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/django-catalyst/</a><p>I copied the chained actions model from Catalyst, and the routing is automatically generated. I also have template tags defined that construct these URLs for me (not uploaded in the repository).<p>I structure my views in a structure like ...<p><pre><code>   views/root.py
   views/articles.py
   views/users.py
</code></pre>
views.root contains a ""begin"" method, that will be chained to all other requests. If views.articles needs users to be authenticated, I also add a ""begin"" view to views.articles (where I do the authorization required). So as an example, a chain could look like this ...<p><pre><code>   views.root.begin -> views.articles.begin -> views.articles.item -> views.articles.show
</code></pre>
This is really far from the way things are done in Django, but it seems more intuitive to me.<p>What I find cool about Django is that the dispatching is really simple to understand, and it can be extended (and components aren't hard to replace in general).",1250754353

That's the point I was trying to make. Yes, you can reduce your grocery bill all to hell - but in the end if you break down your living costs, things like rent, car, etc, all cost vastly more than what you pay for food. If anything start optimizing there, where a dollar saved won't nearly result in as big a loss of quality of life as it would if you took it out of food.<p>Sure, if you are really broke, then yes, the food budget must go - I've been there myself.

On a dataset of about six thousand names it performed really well, but it was a pretty simple app.  I also used a javascript version on the same list to see how it performed on an X120e netbook, and again, it was instantaneous.<p>No idea how the performance would compare to the methods for common substring.  I like the pairs matching because I can screw up letter positioning and accidentally type a letter or two that doesn&#x27;t exist in the string, but still get back strongly matching results and usually find what I want.  I used it because we had a huge issue at work with people brutalizing names they entered into our employee database.<p>Here&#x27;s an implementation I wrote in javascript: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/doorhammer/3016ecaac5313a87804b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/doorhammer/3016ecaac5313a87804b</a><p>I never used it in production, and it&#x27;s not optimized really at all, but it shows how straight forward a typical version can be.",1396457445

When I worked in an office there were many signals that got me mentally and physically prepared to do work. These included:<p>Getting dressed - I have never worked in my underwear from home but I now make a point to put on some nice pants and shoes and fix my hair/wash my face etc.<p>Driving - Not commuting is a huge time and energy saver but it still gave me some quiet time to prepare for the day. I now either go for a walk in the morning or &quot;get to work&quot; 15 minutes early and read something interesting and tech oriented.<p>Greeting Coworkers - I still haven&#x27;t found a good replacement for this. It&#x27;s hard to catch up on water cooler talk remotely especially since half my team doesn&#x27;t even use IM. I try to check in with questions from the previous day or a quick status update via email within the first hour of work.<p>The office - I&#x27;ve moved my office a couple of times and find it&#x27;s best if the office is a dedicated room, not a nook or a corner of the living room but something with it&#x27;s own decor and sense of place. I painted my office spring green to be cheery and have some plants and a bookshelf with tech books on it. I put a glass whiteboard up that I use to brainstorm and will point my webcam at it if I&#x27;m working with a remote coworker on something that requires it.<p>When I first started working form home I thought that distractions were my biggest problem but I&#x27;ve since realized that it&#x27;s not so much getting rid of distractions, but getting INTO work.",1396456533

If you are suffering from a deluge of recruiters, by all means, do what you need to do to slow down the flow - but it doesn&#x27;t seem like that&#x27;s your problem.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing - the people who are going to be interviewing you and ascertaining your technical capabilities are <i>not</i> the same ones looking for you on the internet (LinkedIn and beyond). Don&#x27;t let a non-technical person say no to you (or worse, never see your profile to begin with).<p>Put the keyword up, there&#x27;s no need to be deceptive about it. &quot;Hi, you look like a good fit at our company because of X&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve used X in my spare time but never professionally, if that&#x27;s alright with you let&#x27;s continue the conversation&quot; - you&#x27;d be surprised at how many companies are willing to keep talking. The demand is intense.<p>There&#x27;s nothing untoward or dishonest happening here. You&#x27;re listing out the things that you know, you&#x27;re not lying about anything, you&#x27;re being entirely upfront - the only extra consideration is writing in such a way that someone searching for you would see you in a search result. Name-drop languages, frameworks, libraries, as appropriate, because those are the primary levers recruiters know to pull when searching.<p>> <i>&quot;I have a detailed history, but I tried to control the amount of detail in each entry to avoid making it too long.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;d suggest expanding. We&#x27;re <i>way</i> past the days where recruiting happened via a pile of resumes on someone&#x27;s desk, and a long one would make it straight into the rubbish bin without a glance. By the time human eyes hits your profile page it&#x27;s already gone through a search filter and likely other recruitment filters - it&#x27;s okay to be a bit verbose since interest is already there. Especially if this verbosity increases your odds of making it past a search filter.<p>> <i>&quot;I&#x27;m going to learn new stacks because they are interesting and potentially useful to me, not to pad my resume.&quot;</i><p>Right, and my suggestion isn&#x27;t to pad your resume with useless filler. That does nobody any good - recruiters end up looking at profiles that have nothing to do with the jobs they&#x27;re looking to fill. The idea is to think about the jobs you want (and are qualified for), think about what <i>their</i> recruiters are searching for, and making sure your profile gets hit when they search for said things.<p>The goal isn&#x27;t to appear in more search results <i>in general</i>, it&#x27;s to appear in more search results relevant to the jobs you&#x27;re looking to find.",1396454939

7516463,comment,7515841,7516321,4,0,dailyrorschach,,,"It is definitely a free speech issue, however, I’d argue that the compelling state interests in preventing corruption and ensuring fairness and access in elections, is a great enough one to merit modest limitations. Indeed so did the Supreme Court until only recently, after the upholding in Buckley. My comment is more about the overall nature of the issue, but I do want to point out first that today’s ruling over aggregate monetary limits, is frankly a small issue in the overall challenges faced in reform.<p>I understand your point, but I think it belies the reality of what takes place in most campaigns from my professional experience here in DC, though yes it is anecdotal of course. Yes, a small group of individuals can seek and gain funding, and they do, but in order to have a serious outcome on a race, you need to be able to shift vast sums of money and fast, often in the last 2 months. The Tea-Party influence on the 2010 midterm elections is a great example, the money that supported those candidates, did not come from the tea-party grassroots, but from a band of very rich donors, with very vested interests in legislative outcomes. And I don’t mean to single out the GOP here, the DNC has it’s own fair share of lobbied well-connected interests. Then of course there are the industries and organizations that simply fund the most likely to win in many races, ensuring candidate support for their industry when the time comes for considering legislation.<p>If I was to start a Super PAC for lower class family concerns, say universal Pre-K, how much of their disposable income do you think they could afford to donate to a political cause? It’d be no where near the vast checks that can be written by opposition groups. And even if successful, I will still likely get outplayed in the long game with legislative lobbying since I don’t have the continued funds to support an ongoing effort.<p>Now what would be a solution that doesn’t infringe on individual rights to free-speech, I’m not sure. Perhaps we should go back to completely publicly financed elections, though that obviously benefits the current two-party dichotomy over independent challengers, and would likely require serious constitutional amendments to be considered. I admit that more thinking would be required here, but I don’t think its a stretch to say the current system is severely broken, and in fairness to all here, was broken well before this relatively modest change.<p>Finally, of course votes aren’t being bought in the election - but a campaign costs a lot of money. <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/11/politics/congress-election-costs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/11/politics/congress-election-cos...</a>  The average US House race will cost 1.6M to win and the Senate 10.4M to win, and that increase far outpaces the rate of inflation. That money coming in is critical to reaching voters, paying for GOTV, and ensuring victory, beyond just the money spent on ads and outside group advertising.  Then of course, all of that money these candidates raise, it’s not free money from well meaning corporations, they will expect to be repaid when the time comes, and they are.",1396454550

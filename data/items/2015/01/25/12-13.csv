All because the zoning (and/or approved buildings) changes on that same land, the value changes substantially.<p>Anything that has such a dramatic change in value is subject to some kind of scarcity, like the difference between a real cezanne and a very good copy.<p>I believe some cities in Texas have relaxed zoning, and the housing prices are much more reasonable as a result.<p>Cities like San Francisco and New York are also subject to physical scarcity because of water and topographical features, but it is artificial scarcity that drives prices up.<p>How do you undo it?  I don&#x27;t think that is possible, simply because there is too much vested interest.  Existing owners and banks must keep the status quo or the 2008 problems would look like a picnic.

I&#x27;ve been raised a Muslim in a predominantly Muslim country, and I agree with most of what you&#x27;re saying..<p>>Education in general strengthens my resolve that my religion is largely ascientific (not non-scientific, but rather outside the realm of applicability for scientific investigation).<p>Yes. There&#x27;s a distinction that I&#x27;ve found not many people make. The prefix &quot;a&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to be easily grasped, it seems. I know it&#x27;s semantics, but it changes the meaning.<p>Immoral and amoral aren&#x27;t the same. Some people also confuse atheism and agnosticism.<p>And what you&#x27;re saying makes sense: Since you can&#x27;t prove either the existence or lack thereof, it is silly to mock those who believe (what many atheists do) or those who don&#x27;t (what many theists do).<p>I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a religiously observant person (lifestyle), but I&#x27;m not insensible to religion.<p>I think Prophets lived in a time where it wasn&#x27;t enough to make a sex-tape to get that kind of following: They had a product people wanted really badly.<p>What product can brag of being thousands of years old and still affecting billions of peoples after the founder and most original staff are gone.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;m interested in religions&#x27; shared values: If you Venn diagram religions&#x27; values, you&#x27;ll end up with &quot;Being a decent human being&quot;.<p>To my knowledge, no religion preaches killing, stealing, cheating, etc.<p>Religions I know of actually elevate the value of work (and perfecting what you do), to being clean and taking care of yourself, to such a high place as to be equivalent to prayer (Islam, and also Judaism if I recall correctly).<p>Again, I find it amusing when supposedly &quot;logical&quot; people scoff at those who are religious as being &quot;illogical&quot;: How logical can you be if you&#x27;re using Hungarian notation.<p>How &quot;scientific&quot; can someone who claims to be, be, when they <i>assert</i> that God doesn&#x27;t exist simply because there&#x27;s no proof (anyone who follows even a mildly scientific method (if one can) knows that the lack of proof of the existence of something isn&#x27;t a proof of its non existence.. Implication being abused, black swans, etc).<p>And vice-versa: You can&#x27;t accuse someone of being illogical if they don&#x27;t &quot;believe&quot; in something they can&#x27;t prove. If it were proved (either exists or not), it wouln&#x27;t be called &quot;believe&quot;, but &quot;know&quot;.<p>I also think that if you plot intelligence versus theism, you get a Gaussian distribution: Extremes represent hard-core atheists and hard-core religious people, who use the same stuff (mocking and ridiculing) the &quot;others&quot;.<p>I stick to being good. Leaving people better than we met them. Sleeping better than we woke up.<p>Anyway, back to coding.. and making better code than I made yesterday.",1422189556

Here are a handful of thoughts:<p>In a nutshell, I think apparel is too cheap, but raising prices isn&#x27;t the solution because of the bargain-hunting and markdown pricing expectations that consumers have that is moving its way further upmarket every year. Brands are scared to raise a penny on their prices, and are right to be fearful because consumers don&#x27;t have loyalty. While manufacturers are living on terrible margins, retailers (who get decent margins) have to deal with the ridiculous cost of retail real estate and stock write downs, which means that the only person who really wins is the importer (in cases when the importer exists) and the consumer. The importer can also lose this game if they work on a replenishment basis (double storage cost there if you&#x27;re following along).<p>Plenty of other reasons exist. If we use the earlier example of a refrigerator, then things like automation come into the picture. The apparel industry, for the most part, is not really automated. I&#x27;ve seen TV manufacturing facilities, and they are so alarmingly automated it seems fake at first glance. Even then, companies like Sony have lost money every year for decades selling TV because the rest of the business can sustain huge losses so Sony can have their logo staring at you every day of the week in your living room. Apparel businesses don&#x27;t have that kind of luxury because most are not small hobby businesses of a larger conglomerate.<p>Then there are lots of political issues such as the United States customs policies. FTA like CAFTA/NAFTA, AGUA, special treaties like the ones with Jordan are all affecting apparel. Do you know a synthetic garment from a country like Sri Lanka (lots of, for example, Nike production happens there, so think about an athletic garment from them) will be imported at a 32% duty rate?<p>&quot;Fast fashion&quot;, which today basically means very cleverly convincing consumers to buy more clothes means the SKUs have gone up for manufacturers, but since nobody really gets paid anymore the margins get shrunk because of a loss of economies of scale right from the start of the value chain until things are put on retail shelves.<p>Etc. etc.<p>TL;DR Apparel costs about what it should, if we assume it should be a reasonably low-margin, high-risk business. Comparing it to the lower-margin, higher-risk electronics industry is not an easy comparison because of how different the businesses are.",1422188339

Also, the code was poorly organized, with pieces of logic that could have been easily consolidated appearing throughout the app in multiple places so that they could not be abstracted out.<p>After about a month of trudging through his code and making almost no progress, I basically told my manager that we had to rewrite it (I had been thinking this the whole time, but I didn&#x27;t want to be the junior dev who comes in and demands to scrap everything).<p>Me and a colleague paired on it for about 2 weeks and rewrote the whole thing entirely from scratch, leveraging several open source libraries and writing a few tested &quot;internal libraries&quot;.

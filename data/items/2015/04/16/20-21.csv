9390708,comment,9386994,9389567,0,0,jblow,,,"Well, it depends on how that specific hardware is designed, but we could say that hardware that is designed to generate only fixed blocks of audio is very poor from a latency perspective.<p>I think you will find, though, that most hardware isn&#x27;t this way, and to the extent this problem exists, it is usually an API or driver model problem.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about a sound card for a PC, probably it is filling a ring buffer and it&#x27;s the operating system (or application)&#x27;s job to DMA the samples before the ring buffer fills up, but how many samples is dependent upon when you do the transfer. But the hardware side of things is not something I know much about.<p>> If you are writing some sort of synth, as soon as you receive a midi note or a tap, trigger the synth and the note will play in the next audio block<p>Yeah, and waiting for &quot;the next audio block&quot; to start is additional latency that you shouldn&#x27;t have to suffer.<p>> If you are doing some sort of effect, grab the input data, process and have it ready for the next block out. I don&#x27;t understand why you need a second loop.<p>The block of audio data you are postulating is the result of one of the loops: the loop in the audio driver that fills the block and then issues the block to user level when the block is full. My whole point is you almost never want to do it that way.",1429217976

9390697,comment,9389982,9389982,0,0,chatmasta,,,"The question here is, did this guy do anything wrong or is he just a shitty businessman who failed to capitalize on the opportunities for which the loans were given to him?<p>Moreover, why are investors expecting loans to be paid back when given to such high risk endeavors? They were investing in startups, not real estate. Structuring those investments as a loan is an asinine decision on both sides. The borrower is personally liable in the event of default, and the lender gets no equity to capitalize on success. It&#x27;s stupid.<p>There is probably much more to this story, specifically if you note the reference to &quot;bridge loans.&quot; Josh Adler, the plaintiff, is head of a fund called b2rfinance, funded by bridgewater. B2r invests in &quot;hard money lending,&quot; also called &quot;landlord loans&quot; or &quot;bridge loans.&quot; I just learned about this investment yesterday, but I encourage everyone to read about it. Basically it&#x27;s a high interest loan tied to the &quot;after repair value&quot; of any hard asset (houses, atm machines, vending machines, etc.), where the borrower puts the asset itself as collateral. The terms are generally extremely predatory and often result in ownership transferring mid loan to the lender, or high &quot;prepayment&quot; penalties. These are basically payday loans backed by assets instead of paychecks.<p>Some real estate guys I talked to described these loans as &quot;subprime 2.0.&quot; The same mid level investors from subprime 1.0 are taking the loans, investing in flipping houses or renting them. Frequently the equity of one house bought via a hard money loan is leveraged into another loan for another house. You can see how this creates a house of cards. Now bridgewater and other PE firms are putting billions into this vehicle, presumably prepping to securitize into bonds and sell to IB&#x27;s. Distance between borrower and source of funds is increasing rapidly and risk assessment quality is decreasing just as with subprime 1.0.<p>Again, I just learned about this type of loan yesterday and researched it for a couple of hours. I could be grossly misinformed but I think I get the gist. It sounds like an extremely dangerous investment vehicle that could spiral out of control the same way mortgage securities did in 2007. If I had the money and knowledge I would be investigating how to bet against this a la <i>The Big Short</i>.<p>Anyway, all the references to these bridge loans in the article makes me fairly suspicious of the whole thing. Reader beware.",1429217798

I&#x27;m not going to argue that NYC cyclists are perfect and follow all the traffic laws all the time, but at the same time, they&#x27;re really not much different than Dutch cyclists. When it comes down to it, cyclists do what they have to do to get where they&#x27;re going and avoid getting hit by cars. Some differences I have noticed: in the Netherlands, it&#x27;s explicitly allowed for cyclists to bike against traffic on one way streets. Many more bikes in the Netherlands do have lights because 1) it&#x27;s a 60 EUR fine otherwise and they enforce it and 2) the heavy dutch style bikes just tend to have them built in, whereas on the typical NYC bike, they&#x27;re externally mounted and <i>will</i> get stolen off your bike in a heartbeat. The Dutch actually can be <i>very</i> aggressive cyclists, cruising through red lights when there&#x27;s no traffic coming, passing suddenly and closely, flying through crowds of people, squeezing past trams, and generally inducing mild heart attacks in someone like me watching, but they&#x27;re also extremely skilled since almost all of them have been biking nearly everywhere they go nearly every day of their lives since they were small children. They pull off complex maneuvers that I would never dream of and do it while texting. The final difference is that pedestrians here tend to be a bit more aware and will be careful to stay out of the bike paths.",1429214416

It&#x27;s the opposite of a bridge, in which the sound from a previous scene carries into the next.<p>Ostensibly, this is a reflexive design element, though these things can have sublte connotative/implied ideas. Sometimes the prelab audio matches both pre- and post-cut scenes, and help you to think about the content in a different way. Or, it may just be an interesting way to cut your content. :-)",1429214409

At Yale, 90% of my friends are going into banking. I&#x27;m sticking with tech (though I did interview with some banks), but my roommate&#x27;s dad is a career advisor at the management school, so I know about this. For us, the way it works is that all the big banks have info sessions. You go to those, talk to the presenters during the &quot;networking session,&quot; secure a business card, send a follow up email, and then probably get an interview. At that point it&#x27;s up to you to impress them with your interview prep.<p>If they don&#x27;t recruit at your school, it&#x27;s going to be much tougher for you from what I&#x27;ve heard.

TCP congestion control is a minor miracle even before you realize that this plays out writ large across the whole Internet, large-pipe-huge-pipe-small-pipe-big-pipe, without the Internet collapsing, which is what it used to do. One of the big challenges in designing fast scalable transports that gain speed by allowing drops or out of order delivery is in making them compatible with the congestion control regime that TCP implements.<p>TCP is complex because it solves a mindbogglingly complex problem.

I&#x27;m happy yours is holding up OK, though. It was the highest end and highest resolution laptop they had at Fry&#x27;s when I needed a new laptop on short notice, so I bought it with little research.<p>Problems I&#x27;ve had:<p>Dead pixels. New ones have sprung up just in the past couple months. I think it has 7 now (in two clusters).<p>Heat. Damned thing runs hot enough to literally burn my legs. It has &quot;Cool Sense&quot;, which allows you to choose between &quot;Slow enough to where you have to take coffee breaks between opening or closing new tabs.&quot; and &quot;Oh gods, why am I on fire?&quot; So, I disabled Cool Sense. It made the computer vastly slower than the one it replaced (and the one before that one).<p>Keyboard is truly awful. I&#x27;m a great typist, but this keyboard slows me down, and misses strokes if they aren&#x27;t really firm. Also, if you type really fast, it&#x27;ll sometimes randomly insert the number &quot;6&quot;. Why 6? I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s just this thing it does.<p>The faux metal coating began discoloring within a couple of weeks or purchase. I&#x27;m an obsessive hand washer, and I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other lappy. This one just sucks at looking good. I&#x27;ve never put stickers on a laptop before, because I like a shiny new looking laptop...this laptop looked like crap so quickly, that I put stickers all over it to cover the crappiness.<p>Fans makes a horrible racket for a few minutes when returning from sleep or booting. I have no pets, and I don&#x27;t smoke, so my house is not very dusty or plagued by particulates. I&#x27;ve opened it up to try to clean it and blown it out with compressed air, but no apparent dust was present. The fans are just crappy and noisy.<p>The headphone jacks are janky. I can mostly only get one channel out of them. I use this laptop for movie screenings (my audiovisual company does outdoor screenings on a pretty large scale; sometimes for 1000+ people), and had to buy a new USB audio interface to get reliable sound output. The USB interface is a minor expense in a $25,000 setup, but it&#x27;s a nuisance to not have a decent audio output on a high end laptop that claims to be good for audio. Also, the Dre Beats filter is awful; I recommend disabling it on any device that has it.<p>The trackpad (a fancy multitouch thing) has been really...umm...touchy. For most of it&#x27;s life with me. It&#x27;s gotten solid under Linux (or I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, when others use my machine they are startled by the jumpiness of the touchpad; I&#x27;ve mostly acclimated to treating it with kid gloves). Under Windows it is still really bad. Typing on the keyboard can make the pointer jump and trigger a click, so focus can shift without warning while typing. I&#x27;ve never been able to adjust this away, and it is infuriating and makes working under Windows on this machine a serious burden.<p>It has begun to die. Every few days the caps lock light will flash ominously, which, according to the documentation means it needs to be serviced. I haven&#x27;t figured out what, specifically, is wrong with it, but since it&#x27;s my primary computer, I&#x27;m loathe to be without it. Sometimes it goes away after sleeping or rebooting, sometimes it stays on for days. Again, I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year. Every other lappy I&#x27;ve owned has lasted 4 years or more. This laptop is a sad story.<p>Maybe I got a lemon. I wish I&#x27;d taken it back during the return period, but I needed a machine to work on...so, it ended up staying with me. I won&#x27;t make the mistake of buying another HP.<p>As for Linux compatibility, it&#x27;s actually really good, except for sound (only one set of speakers works, so it is <i>really</i> quiet under Linux, and since head phone jacks are janky, I can&#x27;t really even use headphones effectively). It&#x27;s got a lot of Intel components with Open Source drivers. The ATI drivers, both Open Source and proprietary work OK, though I prefer the seamless experience of the Intel drivers.",1388208783

I believe this issue captures it most concisely: <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/pyv8/issues/detail?id=193\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://code.google.com/p/pyv8/issues/detail?id=193</a><p>I&#x27;ll have to see about publishing my work publicly, as I don&#x27;t explicitly own it.  My biggest piece of advice is to always build from the latest branched version of v8, rather than the trunk.  Right now, that would be 3.23.  The branched version tends to be a bit more stable than the trunk.  Sadly, since the PyV8 maintainer works from the trunk, I&#x27;ve often had to build a few revs back to get things to compile if there was a major structural v8 change.<p>If you&#x27;d be willing to share the details of your build environment, I can see if my work is even applicable and go about getting the permission to publish what I&#x27;ve done.<p>BTW, I want to be clear that in no way am I disparaging the PyV8 maintainer.  He&#x27;s been very responsive and helped fix some problems that would have taken me weeks to fix on my own.  The project simply isn&#x27;t focused on stability at the moment.",1388208584

6974067,comment,6973737,6973993,2,0,phaus,,,"Its terrible. If you want good Linux compatibility, get another Thinkpad.<p>System 76 sells rebranded Clevos. The best Clevo laptops are mediocre, the worst are unusable. The Ultrapro falls into the latter category. Quite a few models of Clevo laptops have keyboards that randomly drop keystrokes. The Galago keyboard is by all accounts particularly horrible. More than one reviewer listed this as the sole reason for returning the machine. The company &quot;fixed&quot; the issue by sending out new keyboards with metal strips attached to the back of them. This did absolutely nothing to address the fact that the keyboards don&#x27;t work.<p>Because they don&#x27;t actually make their own systems, there is little that System 76 can do to change the fact that some of their systems are defective. System 76 by all accounts has pretty decent support, but when all they can do is continue to send you more defective parts and / or defective replacement systems, it doesn&#x27;t really mean a whole hell of a lot.<p>After repeatedly trying to fix these issues, one of their favorite sayings is &quot;most of our customers like our keyboards.&quot;<p>Another great quote from a System 76 rep is that the Galago Ultrapro&#x27;s touchpad is hands-down better than a Macbook&#x27;s. Which I found particularly amusing because some of the reviews of this machine specifically mention that the touchpad doesn&#x27;t work correctly.<p>The other downside of Clevo laptops is that the company absolutely sucks at making motherboards. They are inefficient, and it ends up contributing to the Galago&#x27;s poor battery life. This is a machine that should probably get at least 6-8 hours, yet it only gets 3.5-4.<p>I really love the idea of a vendor dedicated to selling Linux machines, but until System 76 pulls off a miracle and convinces Clevo to stop making defective keyboards, people should stop giving them their money.<p>If it weren&#x27;t for the defective keyboard and the terrible battery life, my comment would be completely different and it would probably be getting typed on a Galago Ultrapro. Instead, I have a T430 that I snagged off of Lenovo&#x27;s outlet with 8GB Ram, an i5, and a 256GB SSD for less than $500. Its the best computer I&#x27;ve ever owned.",1388208108

And the work that Apple has put into making touchpads actually useful (both with hardware and software) is miraculous. The keyboards are nice typing experiences (I&#x27;m more mixed on the magic mouse). It&#x27;s also an awesome portable virtualization platform that I&#x27;ve had 4 or 5 Linux VMs all up and running like a champ on it. Multiple workspaces are usually awesome, I keep several workspaces for different semantic parts of my day and the flow is really nice. Airdrop is magic.<p>For the <i>most</i> part things just work.<p>To try and make it really stick, I went cold turkey for the better part of 9 months and didn&#x27;t touch a Windows machine.<p>But then, small frustrations and irritations finally built up and I recently just built myself a new Windows 7 computer and pretty much use it for all of my day-to-day with my Mac sitting in a travel bag for when I need to go on the road. What is it that keeps pushing me back? I&#x27;ve spent a <i>lot</i> of time thinking about why this is and sorta have it narrowed down to a few user scenarios: Here&#x27;s 1 line of reasoning:<p>1. When I&#x27;m using my Mac, I find I try and avoid actually interacting with OS X as much as possible. I spend all of my time in Office, a web browser, a console window or a virtualized linux machine and that gets me through 95% of my day.<p>2. Digging in deeper and I find that OS X, while having some nice bits here and there (as discussed above), is so full of so many clumsy frustrations that I&#x27;ve never really been able to get over the feeling of reduced productivity when I&#x27;m dealing with it. I&#x27;ve realized that I deal with this by simply avoiding doing the things that frustrate or irritate me. Some of this probably stems from me not wanting to do things the prescribed &quot;Apple way&quot; and wanting to do it my own way. But it&#x27;s irritating enough that I want to get away from the entire system after any extended interaction with the OS bits.<p>3. By and large this is focused on Finder (there&#x27;s other issues, but Finder is the biggest problem I have), which is probably the single worst file manager I&#x27;ve used in 30 years of computing, and no amount of &quot;getting used to it&quot; seems to alleviate the simple fact that it sucks. I&#x27;ve tried a couple replacements, but they all seem to scratch some small itch and nothing really comes close to the magical file management wonderland that is the Windows 7 Explorer. It&#x27;s so bad that even after a solid year with my Mac I still can&#x27;t reliably predict where a new folder is going to be created. I know this makes me sound impossibly dumb, but these kinds of simple file management interface problems have been <i>solved</i> everywhere else. Even the various Linux file managers work better and more reliably. I would be so much more interested in staying on my Mac if I knew I could manage files without feeling like I was poking around a dark damp hole trying to sort through and pick up grains of rice with my elbows. I could go on for pages ranting about the abortion of ideas that is Finder, but let&#x27;s just conclude that I hate it.<p>4. I realized that one of the reasons I spend so much time in a terminal then is because managing files form the command line is better! (the other reason I&#x27;m in the command line is so I can ssh into my linux VMs)<p>5. so if most of what I&#x27;m doing is Chrome, Office, ssh and Linux via VirtualBox, which are essentially equivalent experiences in OS X or Windows, and then doing OS things like moving files around works better in Windows, why should I still use my Mac?<p>I&#x27;ve come up with other lines of reasoning:<p>- all of the media production tools I personally work with have emphasized Windows development over Mac development for a while or no Mac equivalent exists at all.<p>- retrocomputing and retrogaming, which I have a deep personal interest in, has a far richer ecosystem under Windows and the tools that have version for both OSs tend to work better in Windows. Also moving around and organizing tens of thousands of files related to this hobby is much better under Windows<p>- another hobby, photography, I shoot thousands upon thousands of photos and haven&#x27;t met an photo organizing tool I like, so I manage everything on the filesystem, which again means I&#x27;m avoiding finder<p>- Until Mavericks, multi-monitor support with full-screen apps was broken, and there&#x27;s no excuse for it. None. Maximize was solved in Windows 3.0. <i>23 years ago</i><p>- OS X seems to keep growing interface hair, meaning what started as simple elegant design slowly accumulated feature cruft until the design is no longer simple or elegant and the design wasn&#x27;t really flexible enough to accommodate this growing interface hair. Witness the madness around the resizing window buttons in OS X. But all the various crap that shows up in my menubar vs. sometimes in my dock vs. sometimes nowhere but ps, etc. Or the haphazard combinations of modifier hotkey combinations that don&#x27;t really carryover between apps, a legacy of the one-button mouse movement which is now just vestigial, but now means I have to keep track of which combination of shift, fn, control, option and command to use in <i>some</i> combination <i>before</i> I even think about what button I need to push to modify some other key to do some menial task that&#x27;s standard and two buttons in Windows.<p>- Even after taking hundreds of screen shots over the last year, I <i>still</i> have to lookup the madness of screen capture in OS X every single time I sit down to take more screen shots. Here&#x27;s a 3 page article on it. <a href=\"http://osxdaily.com/2010/05/13/print-screen-mac/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://osxdaily.com/2010/05/13/print-screen-mac/</a> Sure I don&#x27;t get a &quot;prt scr&quot; key on the keyboard, but I get half a dozen key modifier keys and an eject key. I&#x27;ll sometimes just put off the task till I get home and just do it in Windows it&#x27;s so irritating.<p>- There&#x27;s no paint program that ships with OS X. Boggles the mind.<p>- Having to buy and install tons of little apps to &quot;fix&quot; some broken or poorly designed behavior in the default apps that ship with the OS. This isn&#x27;t like buying photoshop because it fixed paint. Photoshop is a different level entirely to paint. This is like iTerm2 which is <i>almost</i> exactly like, but just fixes a few things and adds a couple things to iTerm. And this kind of drop-in replacement cancer permeates the entire Mac experience. There&#x27;s entire ecosystems of slightly different replacements for the default apps, and it&#x27;s entirely expected that setting up a new mac will involve hunting these down and installing them to replace the broken stuff that the OS ships with. I&#x27;m really just exhausted of both this process and the attitude that this is a perfectly normal and sane thing to do. It&#x27;s not, the OS is shipped broken and Apple needs to fix this stuff.<p>- Video performance is noticeably better in Windows. I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but I find my Mac has lots of little screen-tearing issues, and watching full-screen video on it just isn&#x27;t as snappy (using VLC on both) as it was on my 6 year old Windows box (before I built my current one).<p>- Things usually <i>just</i> work in OS X. But when they don&#x27;t you enter a world of mystery that goes as deep as a computer science degree can take you. In Windows, these days things also more or less <i>just</i> work, but when they don&#x27;t, there&#x27;s a kind of expectation in the design that you&#x27;re likely to have an issue so there&#x27;s all sorts of good error reporting and resolution paths to try and exhaust before even having to start searching forums for advice.<p>- I need to read NTFS volumes frequently and OS X&#x27;s default NTFS compatibility sucks and the fixes are out of date and don&#x27;t work very well either. In contrast, I&#x27;ve never had to read an HFS (or whatever Apple journaled blah blah file system) volume.<p>- no dedicated page up/down home or end keys. I use those keys <i>all</i> the time. Why are they gone? It&#x27;s irritating having to hunt down a modifier key and an arrow and hope that you figured out the magic combination that&#x27;s &quot;home&quot;.<p>- I can&#x27;t multi-tab drag in Chrome. I drag groups of tabs around in Windows all the time. Doesn&#x27;t work in OS X.<p>- minimized windows are a pain to bring up. Therefore I don&#x27;t minimize in OS X. The dock (especially when auto-hid) is flaky and won&#x27;t show up half the time. The delay for when it <i>does</i> feel like popping up when my mouse is down at the bottom of the screen feels entirely random.<p>- I don&#x27;t like any of the text editors I&#x27;ve tried. I just end up in vi in iterm. But I really want a good text editor.<p>- VNC is not a suitable remote desktop solution compared to RDP. It&#x27;s just not. I Remote into half a dozen machines over the course of a day and wish I had a decent way to remote into my Mac that wasn&#x27;t VNC.<p>- and more and more and more<p>I&#x27;m sure there are built in solutions I&#x27;m overlooking, or some app I can install that fixes this or modifies that, or some setting that makes something behave better than the default. But the point is that outside of applications that exist on both platforms equally, I&#x27;m avoiding or annoyed with everything else on the platform. I&#x27;m committed to sticking it out and have even resolved to spend more time on my mac - especially post-Mavericks. But it&#x27;s just not a better computing experience for me. It&#x27;s interesting and it&#x27;s different, and it makes me yearn for certain things that windows doesn&#x27;t have (multiple workspaces), but when the equivalent functions work better in Windows I&#x27;m forced to choose the easier and less frustrating environment to spend time in.",1388208007

It&#x27;s rigorous in the mathematical sense, so if you&#x27;ve never worked through a rigorous math textbook before then this might be a good start since you&#x27;re familiar with the underlying material.<p>Here are some exercises to give you a sense of the flavor.  If you find these exercises trivial then the textbook might not be for you.  If you find them hard, well, welcome to math! :)<p>These are all before we get to any &quot;calculus.&quot;  Here &quot;function&quot; means a function of the real numbers.<p>1. Let f be a function that satisfies the conclusions of the Intermediate Value Theorem.  Prove that if f takes on each value <i>only once</i> then f is continuous.  Generalize this to the case where f takes on each value only finitely many times.<p>2. Prove that if n is even, then there is no continuous function f which takes on every value exactly n times.<p>3. A set A of real numbers is said to be sense if every open interval contains a point of A.  Prove that if f is continuous and f(x) = 0 for all numbers x in a dense set A then f(x) = 0 for all x.<p>4. Find a function which is continuous at every irrational point and discontinuous at every rational point (and prove it as such)<p>Spivak&#x27;s <i>Calculus</i> is used as a first-year calculus textbook at lots of schools, so if you find the above even a little challenging or strange-seeming then I&#x27;d recommend going through the book.<p>The last chapter of the textbook is a rigorous construction of the real numbers from the rationals using Dedekind cuts (referenced in the first link).",1388207686

The &quot;sockets-emulated-over-STREAMS&quot; was the standard way of doing things in SVR4-based UNIXes.  In the early-to-mid 90s this gave them a poor reputation among early web admins since they just didn&#x27;t handle high rates of connections as well as BSD or even the early linux stacks.<p>In the case of Solaris, this was largely fixed in the 2.6 release where they went back to a sockets-based stack and ran the STREAMS stack in parallel.  (Actually this was originally supplied as a semi-supported patch to 2.5.1 since the scalability of the network stack was becoming a critical issue at large customers)  Many of the OS-supplied services (like rpcbind I think) still used the STREAMS API but the 99.9% of external software that used the sockets API now had a fast native path to the network.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware this is still the state there today, with STREAMS probably still existing for compatibility but basically ignored by everyone.<p>There were some interesting things Solaris did with STREAMS.. for instance telnetd and rlogind would just push a kernel-land module that would copy data between the pty and socket.  This way you didn&#x27;t have to make the kernel->user->kernel->user transition on every keystroke.  In the heyday of shell accounts this was terrific.  Of course these days CPUs are so much faster and everyone uses ssh anyway so it wouldn&#x27;t be a useful optimization.<p>STREAMS was an interesting experiment, but I don&#x27;t mourn its passing at all.",1388207335

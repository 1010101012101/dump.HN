I find it a bit worrying that mainstream media is still vewing them in this light. It smacks of not being taken seriously still - I wonder how that can be addressed?",1244455029

647054,comment,645992,645992,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"The article seems to be missing the evidence to show that people treat their kids in a given manner as a result of where they work.  Just as possible (although certainly less palatable) is the conclusion that parents who are capable of getting white collar jobs, or any job at all, are inherently more inclined to treat their children in the way that they do.  This possible conclusion is not even considered, so the article pretty much amounts to guesswork.",1244454856

Because it sounds like you're saying that, for example, someone with both legs amputated is somehow less human than non-amputees.<p>How much of the body would you have to lose to not be human any more? And what is the basis of this theory? I was under the impression that if you keep the brain, the spine, and some compatible means of sensory input, the rest is basically optional.",1244454849

647049,comment,646288,646650,0,0,cwb,,,"Distinction understood. Many think that the risk of misuse * potential cost is unacceptably high however. Misuse is also relative to current political fashions and those tend to change over time.<p>If you want, surveillance on that scale makes the system unstable.<p>Sweden has a history of a government that registers details about those with views not aligned with the sitting government without legal or, I would claim, moral right to do so: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_affair"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_affair</a>. More recently, there was a potential leak from FRA <a href=""http://www.thelocal.se/12778/20080702/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelocal.se/12778/20080702/</a> - as in the recently passed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRA_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRA_law</a>. Of course, illegality does not imply immorality/misuse, but it might explain why Swedes are weary of what lines their government might cross.<p>The activities have not verifiably, as far as I know, been seriously misused in Sweden (in the sense that people have been killed, tortured, or wrongfully imprisoned), though one other European country comes to mind where that did happen, most seem to agree, in the 20th century.<p>Thus, my guess is that many people assume logging/monitoring personal information implies misuse of that information because they consider the risk*potential cost of the latter unacceptably high, even though it's not strictly an implication. The assumption should be explicit though, so I agree on the importance of making the distinction.",1244454430
647048,comment,646955,647033,0,0,sho,,,"Well, it's not <i>that</i> meaningless. Comet is basically long polling; those connections aren't really doing much of anything until something turns up on the back end to be pushed down them, at which point the connection is usually closed and then re-requested by the client. Maybe with the occasional ping, I've seen some people do that too.<p>How much memory and CPU is required to simply hold open the connection and sit there is definitely of interest to people. Of course, I'd like to see real world tests too, but that might be rather difficult to pull off without specially written, extremely efficient code on the test side.",1244454368
647047,comment,646288,646464,0,0,vidarh,,,"They've taken a talking point that is <i>shared</i> between liberals, libertarians, communists, anarchists and some socialists/social democrats and that directly affect peoples lives (a huge percentage of people share files etc. and don't see it as something wrong) at a time when big media are trying to tell people they're all criminals.<p>That's probably key to their success - they can take voters from across the spectrum who don't have a voice at all in large parties (the closest in Sweden perhaps being the socialist/communist Vensterpartiet - Left Party - which also wants to significantly limit copyright) but who have liberal tendencies.<p>This has been brewing for a while, and it'll likely spread outside of Sweden, limited by non-proportional voting in some countries. What is particular about Sweden is that Sweden had one of the most liberal policies on copyright in Europe to start with - non-commercial copying for ""personal use"" (including sharing with friends) was (is it still?) legal. This is a right that was ingrained. So when these rights are being taken away, it's natural you get a backlash.",1244454278
647046,comment,646836,646836,0,0,swombat,,,"This somewhat misses the point. The reason why FamFamFam (aka Silk icon set) is so popular is not just because it's free. There are loads of free icon sets out there. However, Silk is <i>consistent</i> and <i>extensive</i>. It has a consistent graphic style throughout, and covers an extensive range of possible icons.<p>Using icons from half a dozen different icon sets will make your application look a bit Frankenstein-like.

647041,comment,646955,647033,0,0,davidw,,,"Not knowing much about Java's NIO, how do you handle 'long running calculations'?  One of the great things about Erlang is that you can sit there doing some big huge long loop, and it won't block the rest of the system because it's got an internal scheduler.  One way to do that kind of thing with C or Java is simply to manually divide your big long calculation into smaller chunks that yield control at regular, brief intervals.  Does Java provide anything higher level?",1244453840

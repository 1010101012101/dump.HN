I would add to this explanation that the real confusion comes from the fact that in most languages when you write `0.1`, it doesn&#x27;t mean 0.1 = 1/10 – instead it means the closest number to 0.1 of the form n/2^k where n < 2^53. Namely 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625, which we can represent in decimal because 2 divides 10. And, of course, the illusion that `0.1` is actually 0.1 is supported by the great efforts [1] made to print floating-point values with the least number of digits necessary to reproduce them, so `0.1` still <i>looks</i> like 0.1 when you print it even though it isn&#x27;t.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/florian-loitsch/printf.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/florian-loitsch/pr...</a>",1447433333

So as far as I can see:<p>- There is a database schema per actor type.<p>- Each actor has a separate physical (SQLite but with the backend replaced by LMDB) database.<p>Is this the case? Won&#x27;t this be using a lot of file handles if there are thousands or tens of thousands of actors? I&#x27;m assuming you already optimize this by closing &quot;idle&quot; actors, but what if they&#x27;re all &quot;live&quot;?<p>How do you coordinate safe schema changes across all actors? You mention that schema changes are performed &quot;just in time&quot;, that is, not when an actor is idle. I can definitely see the benefit of doing that. But for many types of schema changes you <i>do</i> want a controlled migration where you ensure that all tables are fully updated. Can you force the schema upgrade by touching all agents with a dummy query, perhaps?<p>It looks like ActorDB is designed for schemas where data is strictly partitioned, and where data wouldn&#x27;t cross these boundaries, because joins would be impractical/not performant. For example, in a Dropbox-style system, every user would be an agent, and every user would really only talk to a single agent at a time. So that&#x27;s a perfect fit.<p>You also show a discussion thread example, where there is one actor per thread. This would mean that if you wanted to do something like &quot;get all threads where user X has commented&quot;, you would need to either query all agents of type &quot;thread&quot;, or you would need to maintain an agent that keeps track of [user, thread] mappings, and then either query each manually, or use the looping construct (section 4.1.4 in the documentation) to perform the query across the relevant agents.

Based on anecdotal conversations, when they see a story about the police shooting an unarmed man in the back, they think, &quot;Well, the guy was probably going to grab someone&#x27;s little girl and take her hostage.&quot; When confronted with stories where the cop was undeniably wrong, they say, &quot;Oh just a bad apple.&quot;<p>Another problem is when (usually) black America sees a police boot on someone&#x27;s face, and notes that statistically it&#x27;s usually a black face, and their instinct is to say, &quot;Well, I guess it was because he was black.&quot; When confronted with stories where the face is white, they say nothing.<p>This breaks my heart. We should never allow a police boot on anyone&#x27;s face for any reason. The police are public servants, our servants, there to keep the peace, and stop violence from happening. They are not the punishers - that is the role of the court. They are not above the law - they need to hold themselves to a <i>higher</i> standard of conduct. <i>The police should be the best of us</i>, but instead we get low-to-average intelligence physically large men who can keep themselves clean and fit, fill out basic paperwork, and who can follow orders. Emboldened by the attitudes of white, middle-class women that &quot;cracking heads&quot; is a sign of order, also a sign of machismo, and absent any authority to stop it, it continues, and it gets worse.<p>Now, cops go out on a disturbance call, escalate it to violence, and then they &#x27;hurt the bad guys&#x27; - cracks some heads, throw &#x27;em in jail. The cop moves on, but &#x27;the bad guys&#x27; keep getting hurt, in local lock up, by a justice system that will never hear their case, and then for years by a privatized penal system that takes every economic and social advantage of the prisoner that it legally can.<p>What we have now is a police force whose individual instinct and unmet need for &quot;respect&quot; (actually, dominance) drives their decisions. No-one can stop them. The police have each other&#x27;s backs. The judiciary has the backs of the police. And the voters are split between two very different, very wrong reactions to the problem - which takes back seat to things like &quot;the economy&quot; and &quot;abortion&quot; in every election.<p>Right now, the best we can do is tell the stories of the people who&#x27;ve been harmed by the police. We need to focus on white, middle-class people, to address both mistaken instincts. We need to fund independent police-malpractice commissions with real teeth, to investigate allegations of wrong-doing. More than anything, we need to reform the way police work is done, making it illegal, for example, for a uniformed cop to coerce a suspect, to lie about the law, or to escalate a situation. We need a &quot;broken windows&quot; policy <i>applied to the police</i> where even small breaches of policy - words of disrespect, for example - trigger a reprimand. We need to ask ourselves why cops <i>swarm</i> on every encounter with a citizen, why they have their hand on their gun when they walk up to your car, why they beat people up so much and get away with it.",1447433063

Well written Scala code is much more pleasant to write and maintain than Java (true even for JDK 8). Scala&#x27;s feature set is great, but you need to have good taste to use it effectively. It&#x27;s a bit like the gang of four design patterns which some developers, especially Java developers, go looking for places to apply as many of them as possible. Rather consider where the features add value - they are <i>very</i> useful when used appropriately. When used sensibly Scala is amazing. You just have to keep an eye on the new guys so that they don&#x27;t just use advanced features all over the place where they aren&#x27;t appropriate.

The problem here is not lack of coal business; it&#x27;s lack of ability or motivation for these people to pull up stakes and move to a better area.<p>I would suggest North Dakota, or would have up until a year or two ago when the price of oil dropped drastically.  The jobs up there were paying crazy wages, truck drivers pulling six figures, restaurant dish washers making $15-20/hour etc.  It&#x27;s a temporary boom but the fact is, that&#x27;s where the jobs are, or were.  Still better economy up there than in Kentucky, even now.<p>Thus, what&#x27;s really missing from these backward areas is education.  With good education, even just K-8, people will have the ability and resources to understand that they can vote with their feet and move to where the economic opportunities are.  Someone with mining experience might do OK as a roughneck in west Texas, Oklahoma, or North Dakota.  If you&#x27;re a hard worker and have been in the mines, or driven trucks, or done back breaking work outdoors, you&#x27;re going to be able to find something.<p>But as for people who just sit around their cabins, the classic backwoods hillbilly stereotype, addicted to opioids or other chemicals and unable to or unwilling to do something about their situation -- sorry if this sounds hard hearted but it&#x27;s hard for me to dredge up a lot of sympathy.

The money is what is charged, not the person.  So the money has to prove itself innocent, which is pretty much impossible.

This is great if you're building one of the turn-based games of the 90s but the REST of the world has moved - and the talented kids who can cut stellar client side apps aren't doing it with a restricted HATEOS mindset.<p>So while Google makes arguably the best REST client with Chrome, they're not wasting their time trying to restrict their Single Page Apps around HATEOS constraints.

I previously worked for a microfinance bank in the Philippines where we employed staff at a little over the minimum wage there which was $5 per day.  While we were getting ready for a new product launch I had some staff we couldn't use yet, and seeing they all had computers and internet connection ran a small experiment on Mechanical Turk.  They averaged $5-10 per day in income so I stopped it after a month.<p>There were several problems:\n1. Many of the more valuable task required you to meet certain 'skill' levels which these staff didn't\n2. Motivation was a huge problem as spending hours per day clicking on images with people or editing text you don't understand was very dull\n3. We had problems with internet bandwidth being too slow to allow running through tasks rapidly<p>It was a pity this experiment failed as it would have been a great way to scale up and create income opportunities for some very destitute people.",1330304158

If your types or parameters change, your clients won't work anymore unless they re-read the WSDL. With Java and .NET, that generally requires recompiling the clients and redistributing them.<p>That's what Roy's talking about when he says REST is about designing on a long term scale. A client that uses a RESTful API should be parsing and navigating the representations dynamically, which allows them to handle changes in the representation gracefully. The clients can never handle <i>semantic</i> changes to the API, but they can handle structural changes.<p>What do I mean by that? If you provide links for paging, and the link for the next page uses rel=""next"", that's the semantic meaning for the link. Your client has to hardcode the knowledge that it needs to find the link with rel=""next"" in order to go to the next page. But, it doesn't matter where that link may appear in the page, or what the url for that link happens to be. These are both structural details that can change over time without breaking your client.",1330303929

Otherwise you can just ignore order or whether the endpoint receives it or not. It is a broadcast rather than a hard line essentially.<p>For instance let's say you have some physics update and for some reason you needed it networked, with many objects, receiving only 70% of those for many different elements may be just fine (discarding any you receive after that are older maybe for this example)...you may not need reliable acknowledgement that they received for most of them if any.  But you definitely need to know when an enemy is killed so you make that a critical message to the server RPC'd to the clients and use a reliable flag which then will expect validation.

It <i>is</i> impressive to be able to solve a series of tiny bugs with just 60 seconds for each one, but I don't think it's the right metric to find the elusive ""10x"" programmer.<p>It's my opinion that ""10x"" programmers are an order of magnitude faster than their peers not because they are lightning-fast at spitting out code (although they may be).  They're faster because they can analyze the problem, drill down to its essence, and come up with an effective plan for solving it.  Contrast this with a poor programmer, who might code circles around the problem, wasting time writing code that could just be taken from off the shelf.  It doesn't matter if the poor programmer somehow is brilliant at punching out correct code if the code they're punching out didn't need to be written in the first place.<p>It's like selecting creative writers by holding a contest to see which ones can spot a grammatical mistake the most quickly.

Getting into why this happens with empirical studies of large data-sets is complected, but boils down to looking at enough things until signal is indistinguishable from noise.

Because, contradicting a study is worth publishing and publishing is a numbers game, you have many people who simply reproduce research to pad their numbers and cut down on clutter.

Until now, programs written in Javascript could only use one internet protocol: HTTP. Websockets brings low-level TCP socket programming to Javascript, enabling the use of any TCP-level protocol.<p>Of course, this happens within a sandbox that involves initiating the connection over HTTP and tunneling the protocol through a server over port 80. But that server can be a proxy that forwards the stream to any TCP service, on any TCP port. We're back to the days when anyone could and did develop their own protocols, and many of those became standards.<p>I suspect that we're going to see that kind of development again: people will initially create their own protocols to use over Websockets, then they'll recognize the benefit of tunneling existing standard TCP protocols to their Javascript programs (how about an IMAP client written in Javascript?) then finally someone will develop an HTTP client in Javascript.",1330301909

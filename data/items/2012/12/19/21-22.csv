This makes the double clickable aspect super handy to me :)<p>Sometimes I hear that people don't want to have to press shift, which is understandable considering how much we code.

I mean after all, in a private company it would be pretty impressive if the company nearly doubled in size without adding substantially to the number of managers.<p>The point isn't that the federal government isn't large, it's that it's a complete mispreception to assert that the TSA is a good microcosm of the federal government. The TSA is a traditional bloated bureaucracy, with tons of government employees doing not much of anything. That's not what most of the federal government looks like. I've worked in a federal agency and in the private sector, and if anything the federal agency was better run and more leanly staffed.<p>In reality, 95% of federal expenditures are just checks to other people. Checks to farmers to subsidize agriculture, checks to states to subsidize highway construction, Social Security checks, Medicare reimbursement checks, etc.<p>The fact is that people rant up and down about how bloated the federal government is, but nobody can ever point to non-trivial ways to reduce spending. And the reason is that it's not a matter of simply firing a bunch of bureaucrats that sit on their ass doing nothing--there just aren't very many of those people. Rather, it's all about not writing those checks. Writing a $20 billion check to subsidize suburban commuters instead of $40 billion, cutting grandma's social security check by 20%, etc. That's where all the money goes.",1355953639

4945035,comment,4942931,4942931,1,0,VaughnDTaylor,,,"This is something that has been messing with my workflow so hear me out. First, I use CodeKit on my local machine to compile. CodeKit allows me to choose a framework (bootstrap-master > LESS files). I don't want to keep multiple versions of bootstrap-master sitting around on my computer. Preferably, I'd have the most current version with which I'd use to build all of my CSS (regardless of the site I'm working on) by simply pointing to the bootstrap-master directory. However, the inclusion of variables.less in bootstrap-master > bootstrap.less (where it's an import) makes this difficult - variables.less is the ONLY file in bootstrap-master that I need to slightly tweak for each site I create. The variables.less file should not be a default import in bootstrap.less - at least this would be ideal for me. The way things are now, I have to modify bootstrap.less (to tell it not to import variables) and variables.less (to control colors, grid, etc). I'd like to just update all of the bootstrap-master files in one fell swoop without worrying about overwriting my changes to these two files. If variables was not a default import AND it was outside of this framework directory, I could update every file in bootstrap-master without worrying about overwriting anything. I hope I have communicated this in the right way - it seems a bit muddled?",1355953604

But a lot of unknowns could invalidate a patent, perhaps just decidedly not detailed enough by a judge who ends up reviewing it, which I don't think makes sense to be a point of having the troll pay for it. If a patent is seen as invalid, then it can no longer be used to sue people.<p>#3 Agreed.<p>#4 It would be impossible for either party to prove, so then this just leaves costs open ended for the person who owns the patent.<p>#5 This is confusing. They seem to be trying to deal with a problem not directly associated with patents themselves? More they just want more information to make it easier if it'd be a good idea or not to infringe? You could always send an email and ask if what you're doing infringes - assuming you're not trying to patent something on top of existing patents further. Though I imagine that's not a tactic most people would be comfortable with.<p>#6 Define what a small fraction is, vs. how important something is in an application; It could be the most valuable piece in some overall 'bloated' scheme<p>#7 If you look at benefit to the economy, currently measured by GDP, any money being spent (on lawyers) is positive for GDP, and therefore for the economy..<p>In conclusion, I think these suggestions put forward by EFF are meant to deal with stopping the damage and strain trolls put on the system, though not fairly take into consideration real innovation, that actually is created, and used. Things like ""swipe to the right to unlock"" - I don't think that's complex enough to consider it patentable - but it is patented (I believe) - but never should have been. I am sure there are much more complex systems that people can come up with, that might take many years to develop or discover - but once known and concepts turned into something tangible, it would not take long to re-engineer, so there may not then be any incentive to attempting to develop said system; It could even take years of looking for someone to fund what you want to create that you have a patent on, especially if it's ""so far out there"" that people might have trouble understanding its value. Anyway - it'll be interesting to see where it all goes. I think all patents, software and not, should be thrown out. Other mechanisms would surface to allow innovation to move forward.",1355953308

4944905,comment,4934739,4939216,1,0,kirse,,,"Hmm, think this through a bit more.  When you have been influenced on a subconscious level, you aren't aware that you have been influenced.  If you aren't even aware to know it's happened, how can you possibly analyze and weight it?  How much of your day do you genuinely believe you spend consciously evaluating every piece of information that stimulates your neurons?  There's all sorts of information your brain is vacuuming up during the day which flies right under the conscious ""radar"".  In fact I would argue the <i>majority</i> of information intake is completely stealth to our conscious awareness.<p>The fact is, this sort of influential unawareness happens on a major scale throughout the majority of childhood and adolescence, which is when much of our deepest neurological programming happens -- especially in the ""critical period"" of childhood development.  In this period, all of our neurological processes and decision-making are deeply and richly influenced by others, on a level that we don't even have the capacity to understand.<p>This isn't some new concept, time and time again experiments have proven that the individual capacity for self-delusion is high and our individual capacity to reason objectively about ourselves is limited.  After all, that's why we often look to others we trust when we want objective feedback.<p>So how much do we really ""think for ourselves""?  Is it 50%?  Doubtful.  1%? .01%?  Whatever it is, our decision-making processes have already been thoroughly influenced by many things BUT ourselves over the course of our life.  You might <i>think</i> you are picking a particular course of action because of a produced set of rationalizations, but maybe it's really just how your parents used to behave around you as a child.  Either way, we can't know for sure, which results in all sorts of objective & analytical blind spots.<p>Sure, I'll honor the fact that we do ultimately empower a decision, but how much of that choice to act is truly ""us"" is something that's questionable... as such, I think the best thing we can do is maximize the time we are shaped by positive influences that stimulate our brains and minimize the time we are shaped by garbage.",1355952002

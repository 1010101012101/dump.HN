So ALL those foreign ""rogue"" websites that use other domains and aren't hosted in US will be able to work merrily and be unaffected by SOPA, at least according to the bill itself. Plus, if it does pass, all those rogue sites will be redirecting immediately to a new domain name, and make sure all of their users remember the new domain name by the time SOPA gets enforced against them.<p>That's how much of a joke this bill is, which implies that the bill creators are either this clueless, or SOPA is really just ""Anti-piracy Bill v0.1"" to make people accept it, with more ""improvements"" planned for later.<p>The only people it will actually affect, are actual American sites and companies that will have to enforce this bill, like the search engines, the ISP's, and the financial services.

However, you defend the basic concept that copyright protects artists which enables them to produce more content.  Yet, Shakespeare had no copyright protection so he produced <i>more</i> not less content.  He still profited from his work, just not as much.<p>But, let's look at it from another direction.  Simplify the tax code enough and H&R block goes out of business.  That does not mean society is worse off.  Copyright enriches artists at the cost of society but the real question is society bettor off.  There is a deluge of new content, but the overwhelming majority truly interesting works are not for profit.  I honestly think we would be bettor off if Avatar had never been created an instead we what artists do when they are not pandering to the largest audience possible.<p>PS: I don't listen to music. I don't watch TV. I do occasionally see a movie, but it's been a while.  I used to do a fair amount of reading but I literally only follow a single author who I would just as soon donate to to keep them writing as buy their books.

Why should one person, the creator, be able to tell other people what they can and cannot do?<p>> In that case, anybody can use it, replicate it, seek to profit from it, claim it as his own, or whatever, all without my having any say whatever in that process.<p>This is a common approach, but it completely fails as a moral argument. You are saying it is right because it is good for creators. That is an argument of self-interest, and problem is it immediately justifies its opposite. A non-owner can simply say: <i>disobeying</i> the law serves <i>my</i> self-interest, therefore <i>that</i> is right for me.<p>But it is also short-sighted. You are not only a 'creator', you are a user too. One might well be the greatest writer of books, for example, and so benefit from increased copyright/IP rights. But one will probably not also be the greatest music composer, <i>and</i> the greatest film-maker, <i>and</i> software developer, and so on. We are net consumers, in a sense. To give producers more is to take more from ourselves.<p>Ultimately, we grant IP rights <i>not</i> because they are for producers, but because they are pragmatically supposed to be useful overall -- that is the only justification. There is no other, no sensible rational purely moral argument, for copyright/IP. That ought always to be remembered.",1326901541

- Time between checks (we go as low as 5 seconds, but default for demo accounts is 60 seconds). If i'm correct siteuptime do 2 minutes for a fee, but default to 5 minutes.
- We'll give you phone, sms and email notifications
- Our reporting for response time related data is very detailed, summarized to the hour and available per location we hit your site from (So you can easily tell what things look like from Brazil and Virginia by plotting them both)
- We also do uptime reports, although our graphing is prettier (Soon to have screenshots on the new website)
- You can have multiple users on one account, so you're not sharing passwords etc<p>There are a bunch of things we are not releasing right away, but will have very shortly which might also help out.

Consider the absurdity of this juxtaposition.<p>Modern popular music is properly considered the product of both the artists and the industry. Someone mentioned Rihanna. Do you think you would have any idea who Rihanna is without the music industry? Would her music sound at all the same with the music industry's backing (funds to pay for studio use and hire studio musicians)? If you don't like modern popular music fine, but if you don't like it, why are you pirating it?<p>Given that perspective, when you download music, you are enjoying both the labor of the artist <i>and</i> the record company. If you don't like the price they're charging to enjoy their services, that does not give you the right to simply not pay. (We can debate elsewhere whether you already have the right to not pay, but you certainly don't get that right simply because you don't like the price.)<p>Someone asked for a better analogy. Sneaking into a movie theater and standing (so you aren't taking up a seat) in the back is an analogous situation. You are enjoying the services of the movie theater (which you consider worth breaking the law to get access to) without paying their asking price.<p>Someone reminded us that copying isn't stealing. Well it isn't sharing either. Two children playing with two toys isn't sharing. Two children taking turns with one toy is sharing.<p>To return to the most important point, the author's argument can be summed up and generalized as, ""If you don't like the cost/benefit ratio of a service, you have the right to take it for free as long as no one is <i>directly</i> hurt in the process.""<p>Frankly, I think people like that <i>should</i> be stopped, which as Ed pointed out, almost makes me feel like a SOPA supporter.",1326901137

Get as much sleep as you need and then just wake up. If you get tired, take a nap. The body induces sleep based on your physical and mental activity patterns. I find it best to listen to my body when I need rest and when I have had enough rest.

I guess that means you'd agree with MPAA claims some 16 year old kid out there can be sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars because they downloaded a couple of songs. What if they sue them for $100M, is that valid? If the defendant gets to unilaterally re-define and attribute semantics to words and decide what the punishment is do you think that makes sense?<p>> Saying that they can 'still have that thing' does little to justify why you feel entitled to that thing in the first place.<p>Why doesn't it. It makes a pretty big difference. Not at the point of transaction but during a dispute. If someone steals your song does it mean you can ask for $100M from them claiming you lost potential profit because it was going to be a hit song. How do you decide what one copy is worth? That is the key question. Sorry, but ""it is worth whatever the seller says is worth, is bullshit"". If that hypothetical teenager didn't copy the song, do you think the record company would be $100M richer. How do you prove that?",1326898817

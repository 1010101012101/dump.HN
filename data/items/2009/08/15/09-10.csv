I worked in VANETs ( Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks ) for my BS degree. I didn't find the field that fun though.

What the hell kind of statistics can you have that would back up something like that?  1) It depends on how you do the prevention, and how you handle the event itself. 2) A lot of people would probably die without preventative measures, making it very cheap indeed. 3) What is the point of medicine if we afraid it's going to cost more?  Medicine <i>is about</i> preventing.<p>But it's not more expensive.  Most European countries spend <i>much</i> less on health care, but much more on prevention.  It's very effective, and at the end of the day, it's really what medicine is about.",1250328114

It's a real pity because something very much like drupal is badly needed.<p>Their lack of an upgrade path is killing their ability to keep users.<p>People will try it, invest in it and then the problems start. Maybe you'll find that the theme you are using is not actively maintained, maybe the module that you used and now depend on has a bug in it that you are not experienced enough to fix and so on. Slowly the rot sets in. Then a new version of drupal comes out and you try to upgrade.<p>If you do go with drupal be sure you subscribe to their security alerts list, security bugs are found almost daily, if you have a module that has a fault in it and you're not aware of this then you can bet your life you'll be owned.<p>Just like you I'm still searching for that 'perfect CMS', I've definitely learned the hard way that drupal is not it.<p>It could be though, and maybe at some point there will be a change of attitude there.<p>have you looked at this ?<p><a href=""http://pinaxproject.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pinaxproject.com/</a>",1250327670

It could be true. How does one work out the a priori likelihood of this being true to know whether it is worth looking into further? Metaphors might be one valid method.

764557,comment,763570,764348,0,0,carpo,,,"I think the point that the previous posters were making is that pure REST should not rely on out-of-band information. The client should not have to guess or create URLs from knowledge they may have to look up in some other place. A pure REST API should be discoverable and subsequently navigable without having to rely on any other information not contained inside the request.<p>In practice this can increase the amount of requests required to get at the information you want, and also the size of each request, as it must then include information about the actions that can be taken on the resource. It could be argued that this constraint is more for the benefit of systems or programs that need to interact with the API without knowing anything but the initial URL, and not necessarily a programmer who can work these things out. owever, if a REST API uses this constraint, and application developers follow it, deep changes can be made to the URL structure of the API without breaking the applications that use it.",1250327143

Seems like an interesting thing to say.</i><p>It doesn't ""seem"" like you really mean ""interesting"", but there's nothing controversial here. From the most recent survey of American religious identification:<p>""Another notable finding is the <i>rise</i> in the preference to self-identify as 'Born Again' or 'Evangelical'"" (emphasis added)<p><a href=""http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/reports/ARIS_Report_2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/reports/ARIS_Repo...</a> (pdf)<p>There's also the fact that evangelicals just came off an unprecedented 8-year run of political power, surely the apex of their influence in US history to date. So they've been rising in at least two senses.<p>On the other point, I don't know about the influence of the internet, but it's pretty clear that until some time in the late 90s, or perhaps with the advent of GWB, evangelicals were almost exclusively treated as an unseemly species of white trash by the media and mainstream US culture. It isn't far-fetched to say that expressions of that faith were suppressed. In fact, it used to bother me that they were treated with such knee-jerk contempt. (It now bothers me less, after observing what they did with their newfound influence.)",1250326847

5241364,comment,5240865,5241337,5,0,Xcelerate,,,"Yeah... what I've found from my work is that higher-order modeling tends to leave out important effects.  Which is okay when you're specifically trying to understand one particular property of a system (diffusivity, charge distribution, etc.), but when you want ALL properties to be accurate?  That's difficult.<p>Edit:  I'll elaborate a little bit more.  We currently simulate large proteins using force fields like CHARMM or AMBER.  The problem we're trying to solve is what structure these proteins will fold into, and these force-fields work pretty well for that.<p>But consider this: these potentials are basically a handful of equations that describe stretching, bending, torsional, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions.  The parameters for these equations come from measurements of simple compounds that have similar structure, and these are used to extrapolate what will happen in a different substance.  Good enough for folding, but if you want accurate energy levels?  No way.",1361228274

5241345,comment,5239154,5240968,3,0,codex,,,"Agreed, but the point was not to make developers' lives easier.  Were it, they would have put a monster multicore X86 CPU in the PS3.  The idea was to get maximum performance for minimum hardware cost (that is, minimum number of transistors) even if it made developers lives harder.  This is because the console market typically involves an initial subsidy of the hardware by the manufacturer, and to minimize the need for cooling hardware in the machine.<p>And that is why it was so hard to program--things that the hardware used to do for you, you now had to do in software (manual DMA, caching, coherency).  If you were smart, you could do it better than the hardware implementations (special purpose vs. general purpose), or at least as well.  In this respect it was like a GPU--but people are more familiar with how GPUs work, and they dominate their restrictive niche quite well already.  There was no niche to fill between hard-to-program, special-purpose, graphics-specialized GPUs and easy to program, general-purpose, transistor-wasting traditional CPUs outside of, say, physics engines (and supercomputers).  The Cell was neither special purpose nor general purpose.<p>Sony bet that super-smart game developers would create great things out of hard-to-program machines like they always had in the past (e.g. the PS1 and PS2)--after all, the machine had a ten year lifecycle, so developers would eventually have the skillz.  However, the return wasn't worth it, for the most part--gamers care about graphics, and that wasn't where the Cell could add a lot of value due to the unbalanced architecture of the PS3 and the amazing rate of progress made by GPUs.  So the Cell was used for tasks that a general purpose CPU could do better (if less efficiently), but it was still harder to program than a GPCPU, and it was overkill for CPU tasks (i.e. the game engine) which don't require a lot of horsepower in a game, and don't expose much parallelism.<p>However, Intel is targeting the Xeon Phi at areas the Cell was good at (lots of parallelism, lots of unpredictable branching--mainly supercomputing), albeit with hardware which is slightly easier to program.  I think Sony hit it slightly off the mark, trading a bit too much complexity in software for savings in hardware.  There is definitely a sweet spot.  They would have been better off with a more powerful CPU and fewer SPEs, or SPEs which were slower but had a real cache.",1361228082

Anyone who has a very strong stance one way or another probably needs to reevaluate their predictive capabilities.<p>I do work in molecular dynamics.  To even simulate a million atoms requires huge approximations.  You can get more accurate as you simulate less.  If you want an almost perfect match with reality, simulation will get you about 2-3 helium atoms.  Now consider how many atoms are in a human brain.<p>So it's hard for me to imagine fully simulating a human brain, although I don't see why it is theoretically impossible.  Brains behave according to the same laws of physics as everything else in the universe.<p>On our <i>current</i> technological improvement path, I don't see a brain simulation occurring any time soon.  If quantum computers were developed, it would make things much easier, but we would still need a new ""kind"" of technology.  I wouldn't rule it out completely though.

I'm a cycling tragic who'd like nothing more to see the vast majority of urban transportation space allocated to walking, cycling and PT.<p>But cyclists do upset the 'moral order of the road'.  The speed differential between car & bike is significant which causes cyclists to disrupt traffic flow. Many cyclists don't conform to road rules (I treat stop signs as give way/yields all the time).  Cyclists can easily navigate through gridlock that leaves motorists fuming in rage, and they do so with a smile on their face because lets face it, its very hard to arrive anywhere bummed if you got there via a relaxing ride.<p>The moral order of the road, like most things in life, is reciprocity. If I'm stuck in traffic, then everyone should be. If I have to follow these rules, then everyone should.  When people don't do these things, we get angry because it just isn't fair.<p>But what the author misses completely is why the order exists in the first place and why cyclists (often) think they can be excused from this order.<p>The moral order on the footpath/sidewalk/mall is completely different to the road. Watching people walk through a crowd is like looking at ants. Chaos. But ordered chaos. There are no formal rules (until one steps on the road that is) but people manage just fine thanks to common sense, social convention and lack of speed differential.  Before the car, this is exactly what our roads used to be like.<p>Cyclists (mostly) realise that road rules were created with little regard for them. Hence they don't feel the same degree of reciprocity that motorists do (who typically don't realise road rules have little regard for the needs of cyclists).  Hence animosity between two groups who have very different conceptions of fairness.  If cyclists had dedicated space however, or if road rules gave equal concern to all users, then I think the animosity would be much less.<p>Just look at the animosity (or lack of) between motorists and PT users.  Motorists can see a trade off (crowded buses, no door-to-door service) for any dedicated road space/transit lanes they may receive, hence exceptions to the 'moral order' of the road are deemed fair.  Cyclist typically don't experience that trade off because cycling as a form of transport is, well, simply the efficient and awesome to get around urban environments.<p>The animosity then, stems from a faulty sense of reciprocity or fairness. Cyclists think they have exemptions to some motoring rules but don't seem to pay any extra costs.  What motorists typically fail to realise however, is that those costs are a function of their transport choice - they get stuck in traffic simply because they are the traffic.",1361227307

Locals know this - Microsoft employees who move from Seattle across the lake to the east side often joke about nobody ever visiting them again (sometimes less-than-jokingly). It's also more or less a company town - Microsoft's presence is so overwhelming and absolute that a lot of the technological zeitgeist from the rest of the country <i>never make it there</i>. If you lived/worked there it's easy to believe Microsoft's ridiculously optimistic PR pieces - pieces that would be hilarious when read in any other environment.<p>This isn't even an urban/suburban argument (though it has shades of it), it's a ""company town vs. diverse city"" thing. Microsoft's geographical location gives its people tunnel vision and a grossly false picture of the technology sector.<p>The second part I've observed is a lack of internal honesty within Microsoft. Failure seems to be couched in safe corporate-speak to the point where it's greatly muted (maybe that's the intent). You cannot expect your work force to pivot and fight hard when they've been falsely told their giant failure was a minor hiccup. I saw this after the WinPhone launch - MS employees were still honestly bullish about its prospects even when the market as a whole had completely rejected it.<p>If MS wants to be nimble in the consumer space, it needs to set up shop in cities where their competitors play - you will not get an honest impression of how your products (or your competitors' products) are doing otherwise.

If I go to the store and buy a shiny plastic disc for $30 and take it home and it doesn't play because my $2000 TV from two years ago doesn't have HDCP version whatever, I am not going to go straight out and buy another $2000 TV.

As far as I can tell its continued existence has only two causes: The first is the DRM snake oil salesmen bamboozling people into thinking it isn't a net negative, and the second (which I imagine is the real reason) is that it allows major content producers to better control content distribution channels and thereby exclude, tax or penalize smaller competitors.

I can buy that our simulations of non-linear problems will not fully match 'reality' and cause divergence.<p>However, that doesn't mean we cannot run a model. Exactly what the model's output 'means'... well, that's a different question. To use his examples, our simulations of weather or the stock market do not produce the same output as the future. But their outputs (hopefully) represent actually realizable states of the world.<p>In other words, as long as our model gives us 'human enough' output, then I guess it's sufficient? I mean, it really comes down to 'why do you want to simulate the human brain'. If you want to be able to upload your brain, then that probably isn't good enough.

Thats because its most important features are the result of unpredictable, non-linear interactions amongst billions of cells, Nicolelis says.<p>This is a fringe opinion, and I really wish the title reflected that. Ignoring the absurd 'linear' part of the article, I don't believe predictability is important to the brain. While it's possible quantum effects could explain unpredictability in the physical universe, there is no scientific evidence this is relevant to the brain; the brain operates at a much higher, more macro level than quantum mechanics. Besides, randomness can be introduced into silicon if it's that important. I hope the article is misrepresenting his opinion, but they seem dangerously close to 'the brain is more complex than I can comprehend, so it must be magic'.<p>I and many cognitive and neuroscientists I've spoken to consider this whole line of reasoning to be anti-scientific philosophy (although I may be biased because I studied AI, which rests on the idea that silicon can recreate intelligence).",1361226353

How does reducing the proof on Makers help Skinnygirl Pre-mixed Processed Cocktail Beverage Product in any way?

Beam, Inc. strikes a deal with the distributors saying ""if you want Maker's you also have to buy Skinnygirl"". Once again, if they wanted to dilute it for specific markets, why did they do it for all the markets?<p>I did think of an alternative explanation, though I think this is less likely. Perhaps Maker's sells well at their current price point because there it's a good value. However, if you raise it by, say, $10/bottle, it will now compete with more premium bourbons where it will not hold up nearly as well. Then, lowering the price on it after the shortage is over will even further cheapen the brand. So perhaps Beam, Inc. was faced with a really tough choice of whether to market Maker's as even more premium and lose, or lower the quality and hope that the customers won't mind.

Virtualenvwrapper makes the situation even worse by hiding the virtual environments away.<p>By far the easiest way to use virtualenv is to forget about activation completely, and directly reference the binary you want to use. For example, rather than typing:<p><pre><code>    source env/bin/activate\n    python myprogram.py\n</code></pre>\nJust run<p><pre><code>    env/bin/python myprogram.py\n</code></pre>\nIt's an extra few characters on every command, but it's worth it to totally remove the magic.",1361225077

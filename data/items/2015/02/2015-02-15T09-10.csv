It performs no better than Java on JVM, but is gaining tremendous traction because Google is putting all its weight behind it.</i><p>That&#x27;s definitely a large factor. But let&#x27;s not forget that Go already took off when it was barely beyond being a 20% project. Go also fills some niches, three particular ones I can think of are:<p>- People who like Java, but favor the UNIX approach of small programs over the JVM.<p>- People who like Python or Ruby, but need more performance.<p>- People who like C, but want garbage collection and some extra safety in some of their projects.<p>Add to that that Go is trivial to learn for anyone with a Java, C, or C++ background. Of course, it takes some time to learn all the idioms, but someone who knows languages with C-like syntax can start writing Go programs productively within a day.",1423994336

This is because the memory footprint of a given Haskell program is not at all transparent, and Haskell is notorious for leaking memory in a maddeningly opaque fashion [1, 2, 3, 4]. Space leaks might be relatively straightforward to diagnose and fix for a true domain expert, but I would not want to have to rely on someone having such abstruse knowledge in a production application. It goes without saying that a space leak in a production app is a really, really bad thing.<p>Although, I suppose one&#x27;s choice of Haskell is a function of one&#x27;s own risk/reward profile. Haskell and its failure modes are hard to understand. That induces extra risk that some people (myself included) might be uncomfortable with.

Weighs 5MB. I don&#x27;t think this program in C++ would weigh much less.<p>Anyway it can be improved, but to me there are far more important things to be improved about Go than the binary size of small programs.",1423992105

Why do you need a _quota_ for something as natural as laughter? That&#x27;s like saying you are not human or you don&#x27;t identify yourself as human and see yourself as a drone.<p>RELAX! Let yourself go and let your brain run free. You may find yourself truly surprised at how your brain comes up with weird and funny things. Or, you can find humour talking to your colleagues in the course of work during the day. If not, of course, there are other channels if you&#x27;re _really_ looking for dedicated humour topics (others have said that already, I&#x27;m not adding more to it.

I think you really are missing the point: sandboxing is a bunch of people just forking. A <i>community</i> is when those forks are then cherry picked and re-integrated. Subversion is shit at that.

If they can find a way to do better than you with that knowledge (expressed as software), then your position in the market is based on imperfect information (and therefore, monopolization power).<p>Although you may have everything to start a DVCS frontend, it is not an easy task which doesn't rely only on software: you need the ability to understand the infrastructure needed for the problem and maintain it at a reasonable speed - armies of proficient developers extending and fixing bugs, armies of sysdamins, coordinate them, decide adequate directions, etc.<p>Besides that, you need passion about what to do in order to keep kicking asses. Without it, it is not sustainable in the long run. Think about Launchpad, I think they add extra functionality to bzr than GitHub to git, yet people still sticks to GitHub. Why?<p>Also if you opensource your ""core"", people will need also customizations, so your competitors can become your clients where you provide developing to them - they may target other niche that you can't or your are not interesting.<p>This is where the license comes in: the best way of achieving this is by using AGPL3.<p>With AGPL3, you make sure that everything you gave it won't be restricted to others - as you haven't restricted anyone by opensourcing it.<p>You are not restricting others' freedoms, they can do whatever they want with the software. When someone closes the source, it's restricting others freedom, not his. What you can't do with AGPL is taking away others' freedom and right to know what they are using.<p>If someone improves it, then it will come back to you, and you will be able to improve from others as they improved from you.<p>The MIT license is good, but it doesn't close the loop and may have leaks, :D heheh!<p>A hug from Uruguay,\nRodrigo",1322012805

Whether it cannibalizes other revenue sources is up for debate.<p>However, copyright is also about control and owners want complete control of their catalogs.. for a good reason.<p>Grooveshark crowdsources catalogs without permission from copyright owners and then only lets them manage the content via DMCA takedowns.

Big media are ideologically against Grooveshark paying their users to seed the system without the owners consent.<p>To use an analogy: Grooveshark is a grocery store where the customers personally stock the shelves with Coca-cola products but the company doesn't get to decide which products are available. Maybe the customers don't like Coke Zero and refuse to stock it.

The purpose of visualizing goals is twofold:<p>1. Putting your mind on the job of completing the goal. Once this is done, the mind subconsciously spends time trying to figure out how to complete the goal.<p>2. Motivating oneself to complete a goal by energizing oneself (e.g. to endure working long hours at your startup, you visualize yourself succeeding through various efforts -- this in turn energizes you.)<p>The water glass and thirst example does not require either of these. 1. Getting a glass of water is not a complex task your mind has to spend time pondering, so why would it; 2. Special motivation techniques are not required to quench thirst -- thirst is always enough motivation since it satisfies a basic human need.<p>If instead you're seeking to accomplish a complex goal(e.g. endure working long hours at your startup), and something I don't believe their study is talking about, is the process of visualizing success to energize oneself.<p>Is this article arguing that visualization of goals in this latter case does not work?

3268284,comment,3268045,3268045,103,0,jaaron,,,"Ok, there's a lot to cover here.<p>First off, the Apache Software Foundation isn't trying to absorb anyone or anything. Projects and people come to the ASF. It's a specific policy of the Foundation to NOT solicit projects. If someone says they're representing Apache and soliciting projects, they're wrong.<p>Secondly, Apache is very opinionated about how projects should be run. This comes from years of experience as not only a successful project, but as a successful non-profit organization overseeing dozens of projects. If a community doesn't like the ASF's style or rules (such as no dictators, benevolent or otherwise), they don't need to be there. No one wants to keep projects hostage. Part of the point of the Incubator is to get this figured out earlier than later.<p>Thirdly, about git and subversion. First off, there's increasing support for git at Apache (see <a href=""http://git.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.apache.org/</a>) but there are some serious drawbacks for use of git. Consider this: subversion was practically made for Apache in the way Linus made git for Linux. With that in mind, subversion isn't going anywhere at the ASF. Some of the rational is just plain stubbornness, but some of it goes straight to the core values of the Foundation.<p>Apache has become, for better or worse, the place where lots of projects go when they grow up. Growing up is hard to do. It's not fun. You have to do things like get a job, pay taxes, etc. When a project grows up, people start caring about who contributed what, under which license and making sure every line of code is legit. A lot of engineers don't care about this, but businesses and their lawyers do. A lot of the Apache Foundation ""bureaucracy"" is to handle this oversight and paperwork.<p>Git is an impressive tool and github is awesome for what it is, but it's not a non-profit foundation and it won't replace one. Confusing the Apache Software Foundation for your coding sandbox only suggests you don't understand the true purpose of either.",1322011139

Both content owners and buyers must be completely satisfied for the market to work effectively.<p>The two problems with labels: 1. they want to get paid alot and 2. they want to control their catalogs so that they can control their marketing.<p>The two problems with customers: 1. they want to pay less and 2. they want to listen to whatever they like.<p>Grooveshark solves these problems completely. They pay copyright holders to stream songs on the system and charge customers through ads or fees for the service.<p>At the same time, missing songs in the library can be uploaded by users and they get fairly paid for the ""work"" from Grooveshark's profits. Content owners don't have to do any work to seed the system with their content but they get paid for every stream or download.<p>So labels save money by not having to manage their content, since, in theory, it's already been uploaded by users and the crowdsourcers make money ""working"" for Grooveshark.<p>The catalog ends up more complete than labels typically allow and the users are happier.

Obviously the effort would have been wasted.<p>Replication events are too important to be designed to fall on the floor.  I want at any given time to know approximately how far behind replication is; I want primary write events to block until replication is at least durably scheduled; and if I pause or slow operation and wait for replication to catch up, I want to know that it _is_ caught up without holes.  Cassandra fails utterly to meet these minimal requirements.<p>Master/slave queue is not the only way to meet these needs, but unless a replacement can fulfill the requirements, I can't responsibly switch.",1322010874

A standard cell tower can cost upwards of two million dollars, however the OpenBTS project has shown that software radios can significantly reduce the cost to the tens of thousands of dollars per tower. This, combined with a limited initital rollout can keep the infrastructure costs under one hundred million, not an unreasonable number for venture capital funding once the technology is proven.",1322010873

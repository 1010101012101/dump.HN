Or is it because the code base is so development-unfriendly that working on it is just no fun? (For example, there’s no automated testing.) Soliciting feedback.</i><p>It seems to me that you might do well to try to find a co-founder to work with.  You're clearly full of ideas, and have the skill and discipline to get an MVP out there.  Nicely done.<p>However, I think that having somebody to share the ideas with, prod and poke you, and share some of the burden, might help you achieve more.",1282305556
1620135,comment,1617278,1618583,0,0,Goladus,,,"> I have worked on developing technical review processes in more than one organisation, and spent many hours reading the books, studying the research and conducting practical trials.<p>So have I, although perhaps I've read fewer books and run more releases.<p>> I have never encountered any evidence to suggest that everyone-sitting-there meetings are more productive than sending people copies of the material to check over in their own time and providing a sensible tool to record the findings.<p>My experience differs.  I did not suggest that meetings are <i>more</i> productive.  They are just different.  Whether they will be useful to you, in particular, almost certainly depends on exactly how your organization is put together and how your software is built.  And now that I think about it-- the physical layout probably matters, too.<p>But the pattern I've observed (for the release meeting in particular) is the following:  Send out the materials in an email and get feedback.  Call the meeting and review the materials-- usually about 5-10 people for 30-60 minutes.  There will be completely different feedback.  Both will be helpful, and both will help reduce the need for SysAdmins to escalate issues and prolong downtime.<p>There will be crosstalk, there will be issue resolved via discussion that everyone can understand.  Sometimes, the nature of confusion about a something is best observed through tone of voice and body language.  Sometimes it's all useless-- the plan was right from the beginning, and nobody has any issues.<p><i>Calling a multi-hour, all-hands meeting every time </i><p>For the example I mentioned, 30 minutes to 1 hour is usually sufficient.  If the meeting goes longer than that, usually it's for a good reason and people who clearly don't need to be there will leave anyway.",1282305483

I imagine a lot of other devs have the same issues.<p>I recently decided to take a similar approach, which I'm calling ""quickie startups"".  The max timeframe to build a quickie for me is 2 months.  It's not so much a desperate shotgun approach as it is just getting ideas out of my head, into reality and seeing which ones have merit.  In my head, they're all winners but we all know it doesn't work out that way in reality, as evidenced by a few of your projects (and mine).<p>I definitely sympathize with your disinterest in a project once it's launched.  Building is a fun, creative process. The let down comes when the world is apathetic to your startup and you feel more excitement about the next one, rather than trying to shove something people don't want down their throats.<p>I agree that you have to give it some time with each one and really try to find your market, but when you are bootstrapping, it's more cost effective to focus on the ones that users gravitate toward.",1282304651

With ASCII, the bytes that come in are the bytes that go out again. If you're dealing with UTF-8 and unicode strings every time some data comes in you need to decode it as UTF-8, then pass the unicode string around within Node, then encode it back to bytes before you send it off again.<p>That makes a lot of sense for a web framework like Django (in fact it's what Django does) but Node is more of an I/O toolkit, so that performance overhead isn't welcome unless it's explicitly needed.",1282304073

However your post still came out as a bit of a ""Geez, Apple wasn't that special"", though admittedly then I went a step too far and just assumed you were posting some anti-Apple stuff. Sorry for my prejudice.<p>However a few things to say. The Nokia messenger was imho awesome, but it did not caught on, and eventually Nokia itself killed it (only to revive it many years later).<p>I thought the Ericsson P800 (correct?) was great, and I still do. However I also think it's representative of part of the problem too: Ericsson didn't feel like losing anything, they crammed it with everything imaginable. It had a touchscreen (for a stylus) but you could use it with a keyboard. Why? It didn't seem like they believed it that much. Sure, you may say the problem was that the OS at the time could not allow you to do everything with a stylus, but then the question is: why didn't Ericson worked on that? They had control of the whole system!<p>MyOrigo, I admit I never heard of it.<p>So yes, apologise and I never meant to say that Apple is some kind of genius of the tech world, and that nobody else innovate: there's a lot others too, and there are a lot of problems with Apple products too.<p>But I think Apple has a tendency to play harder, to really take a bet. For the iPhone (as before the iPod) they shopped around for just the right piece of tech, often discovering some small startup nobody had heard of until then. Maybe they would change the interface (like the clickwheel). They would get a whole software stack on top of it, just tuned for that specific product. They would spend ages polishing it, and most importantly if they think a technology is better, they would have no problem neglecting any alternative.<p>Think back at other companies. Why they don't do that? I would imagine if Ericsson found risky to add a touchscreen, the idea of spending many years perfecting such a phone, creating the right OS, using the right tech, removing some stuff... just maybe to release it 3 years later after spending a _lot_ of money, and finding they failed would be a huge loss.<p>Apple seems to take these bets (and to be honest sometimes they lose too). I think that's why the iPhone was really much more of a discontinuity than previous smartphones.",1282302132

The trouble is that rudeness/arrogance is a problem that requires humility to overcome, and gaining humility involves accepting criticism either from other people, or yourself.<p>If it was coming from yourself, you wouldn't be here asking. You have the choice of accepting criticism, or not being helped - there are no shortcuts.<p>Long story short - you're a bit of a prick, and you need to get over it if your request here is genuine, ie, not just a pantomime designed to fool yourself into thinking that ""at least you're trying"", as I suspect it might be. Ask yourself that first.<p>(As you may have noticed, I'm a prick too... I just don't care. I see myself as I see all people - monkeys in shoes, who somehow think that they're so much more. That I'm a prick is a trivial detail in the wider scope of the fact that all of humanity is, collectively, a prick too.)",1282302028

The solution is a big factory that analyses the air, water, or any other mix of substances to extract the substance we like and classify them. It can also create a mix, like H2O....<p>Sounds like a terrible idea, but it's the revolution we need for the next 100 years, if we really want to continue development in the planet Earth. If you are not already aware, fauna and flora are already doing it for thousands of years. And yes, they did it successfully. The sun could be a valuable energetic resource.",1282302017

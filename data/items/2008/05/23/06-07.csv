Map/Reduce approaches to large-scale data processing has been getting most of the hype in the F/OSS space and columnar approaches in the enterprise spaces.<p>An area that is finally starting to get some love are approaches like Mark Logic's ""XML contentbase"" approach -- native XML data store that's wicked fast.  Of course, I'm biased but I think MarkMail (<a href=""http://markmail.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://markmail.org/</a>) is a pretty slick, public example of it in action.",1211525610

197816,comment,196390,197137,0,0,demallien,,,"You seem to be under the impression that I agree with Giles.  Let me refresh your memory of how I opened this little discussion:<p>""I think he has an interesting point about why these types of sites don't work very well. But I think he's wrong to say that there isn't any technological solution - you just have to do away with the idea that everyone is equal.""<p>You see?  I think he's wrong!  But he is correct to point out that current systems favour prolific posters, not quality posters.  I used that idea as a jumping off point to perhaps find a solution, rather than doing a Giles, throwing my hands up and saying it's all too hard, and can't be done.<p>You also seem to feel that by definition anyone that spends time on these sorts of discussion is exactly the kind of person that you don't want to see comments from.  Bizarre.  I mean, take PG for example.  He has effectively adopted the strategy that I am putting forward - he takes a lot of time crafting his essays, but he doesn't make a lot of them.  We all find these posts interesting enough that we hang out on his site, and in particular on HN.<p>My strategy was to try and capture that idea of quality over quantity.  As far as I am aware, no one has attempted to moderate a site this way yet (although maybe I have just not visited the right site yet).<p>Anyway, do you have anything more constructive to say other than 'but, but, you disagree with Giles!!!!!'?  Because, as I've already said, I started this converstaion by stating that I thought Giles is wrong - that I disagree with him is a given.",1211524214
197815,comment,197578,197578,0,0,cesart,,,"Just to be clear, I'm one of the co-founders of Conjunctured.<p>What we're trying to do is <i>eventually</i> get to a YC model or something fairly similar; we're definitely not a non-profit, btw.  While initially the coworking space might not be able to provide seed money, what we do hope to provide from the very beginning is an environment where startups will thrive.  Maybe these startups will come from two guys working as a freelance designer and developer within the space, but we want them to meet, collaborate on a random project, pursue an idea and have their idea take off.  They'll move out of Conjunctured and right next door into their own offce.  ""Support"" from Conjunctured will start out as vouchers for free rent within the coworking space, but will turn into different kinds of support (money, advisors, etc.) given some time.  First the coworking space.  The fund comes later.<p>So, calling it <i>exactly</i> like YC is probably incorrect. Kinda like it?  You could say that.<p>I encourage you guys to look at the district idea right from John at his blog: <a href=""http://blog.think27.com/austin-startup-district-story"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.think27.com/austin-startup-district-story</a> (and to a lesser extent here: <a href=""http://blog.think27.com/austin-startup-community-vision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.think27.com/austin-startup-community-vision</a>).<p>And any Austin people on Hacker News we definitely want to meet, so make sure to follow us on Twitter (I'm @cesart).  We're always up for meeting and usually at least one of us is at every tech event in town.  The fact that we don't know each other already, given how damn small the city is, is the main reason for trying to rally everyone together in the first place.  There HAS to be a central location for everyone to go (startups and VCs alike) in order for good stuff to happen.<p>Feel free to contact me with any questions or arguments. :)",1211524144

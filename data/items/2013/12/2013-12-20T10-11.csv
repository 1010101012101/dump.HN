There are many reasons why someone would want to use this extension.  Sexual abuse support sites are currently being blocked by the filters, so a child being abused by a family member could use the extension to find help on the internet, despite the abuser having the porn filter on.  Or a chap who has been pressured into opt in in might just want to have a wank over some internet porn - it&#x27;s not illegal.<p>If nothing else, it shows how broken the whole mess is.  Opt-out filtering is ineffectual, often targets the wrong sites, and was basically introduced as a sop to a vociferous minority who would rather go back to Victorian standards and sweep all this nastiness under the carpet, than have an actual discussion about pornography and sexuality.",1387537184

Preferably, one where you can also store embedded NULL characters in the string, and thereby aren&#x27;t also subject to strcmp failing to protect you from yet another class of exploit (due to C programs often truncating strings after null characters, which is a pretty common attack surface) due to using null-terminated strings in the first place?<p>FWIW, if people want to say &quot;this API still sucks and users still have to be really careful when using it, but it slightly decreases a specific class of error&quot; that&#x27;s one thing, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it &quot;fails safe&quot;, nor is the panacea that people make it out to be: it is seriously dangerous for people to keep proselytizing that strlcpy is so fundamentally more safe that it can be used with reckless abandon (which, as I point out in the other comments I&#x27;ve made in this thread, is precisely what has happened due to the dogma that &quot;strlcpy is secure and strcpy is not&quot;).",1387536478

It will be less powerful than the higher end phones and tablets, but most game producers target the larger market so, aside from maybe turning some visual sparkle off on less powerful targets, almost everything should work well enough on the Ouya&#x27;s design.<p>I see the Ouya mainly being appealing to gamers who are mostly interested in casual and retro titles, which it is no doubt more than capable of handling. The point is that they are not <i>trying</i> to be a traditional powerful console, they are trying to be what a large group of people (who have traditionally been interested but not interested enough to shell out for a traditional console and its expensive games) are wanting. The fact it also doubles up as a media centre machine, aims to work out of the box (the cheap devices imported from out east are sold as basic Android units with little care for polishing the software install so the user needs a little technical knowlege to get things like XMBC and its ilk to work), and is fairly cheap, makes it quite an attractive package unless you need/want more power (in which case there are better solutions for you out there already).<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ve just checked and the Ouya runs off the Tegra3 and has 1Gb RAM, so it has oumpf than I thought when writing the above. That is essentially the same chipset choice made for the G1 Nexus 7 so noticeably more powerful than any <i>cheap</i> tablets and phones. It won&#x27;t match the high power shiny now consoles and play their graphically demanding titles of course, but again I don&#x27;t think that is the aim and it should be be able to deal with some relatively demanding games (and they&#x27;ll be very inexpensive compared to the AAA console/PC titles).",1387534349

(The only benefit you get is that if you don&#x27;t know the length of the source string you save having to first calculate it; but that&#x27;s a performance optimization, not a fundamentally different paradigm.)<p>The thing is, though: no one actually checks that return value, as this idea that using this API is what makes things secure has become zeitgeist. This post from OpenBSD is even making this mistake: they care only that people are using the API, not that they are using it correctly (despite pointing out the truncation issue at the end, they are just analyzing the usage, not the correctness). Just using this API is not a magic bullet: if you are using the API incorrectly, your program is still incorrect, and if you are using it correctly you can just use strcpy correctly.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe me, this is a really depressing search to perform:<p>site:opensource.apple.com &quot;strlcpy&quot; -&quot;strlcpy.c&quot; -&quot;strlcpy.s&quot; -&quot;strlcpy.3&quot; -&quot;strlcpy.h&quot;<p>OpenSSH doesn&#x27;t even check strlcpy correctly...<p><pre><code>    317         /* No MIN_SIZEOF here - we absolutely *must not* truncate the\n    318          * username (XXX - so check for trunc!) */\n    319         strlcpy(li->username, pw->pw_name, sizeof(li->username));\n</code></pre>\nYeah, that&#x27;s great: we &quot;absolutely <i>must not</i>&quot; do something, but it&#x27;s marked as a XXX?!?!?",1387534063

6940717,comment,6940514,6940657,19,0,elemeno,,,"The conclusion wasn&#x27;t that this was caused by HFT but because NASDAQ and the NYSE only showed trades that had a size of 100 or greater in their public feeds. Since a 100 shares of APPL is worth $50,000+, there&#x27;s a lot of trades being made for less than 100 shares and, until the reporting changes made a few weeks ago, they didn&#x27;t show up on the public feed. This means that trade volume wasn&#x27;t being reported accurately, and that the public feed wasn&#x27;t representative of the active price of a stock like APPL - which is a fairly big deal when, according to the article, 45% of APPL trades are in lot sizes of under 100 shares.<p>For professional traders (and here&#x27;s the only place where HFT is relevant) it&#x27;s not a big deal since they don&#x27;t use the public feeds but instead pay for feeds from the exchanges which include all trades.",1387533786

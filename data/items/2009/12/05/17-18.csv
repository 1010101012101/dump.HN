978299,comment,978263,978267,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Parenscript, a javascript generator, eh?<p>I don't understand, why would anyone want to generate javascript from S-exprs? I understand this is fashionable in the CL world, but I've never seen any good justification for this practice outside of saying, ""Now everything is in lisp.""<p>But this isn't a terribly compelling argument. Most web applications are multi-language and it doesn't seem terribly detrimental to them. Further, the state of the art in web technology moves so incredibly fast that it seems strange and almost obstructionist to insist on a secondary library that needs to be kept in synch.<p>Finally, it tends to lead to crap designs. Anyone who does cross-browser implementations designs will tell you that simple CSS over a generic HTML framework is almost never enough. Frequently you need to introduce new enclosing scopes or add seemingly senseless markup to help make IE play nice (a torturous exercise many web designers still need to go through). So while CL has some awesome web libraries, I'd say their extensive work into making HTML+JS+CSS generation from pure lisp seems like a foundation built on sand. Sometimes I wonder if the whole exercise was just to avoid working with HTML, which many (more prejudiced) developers find distasteful to work with.<p>I don't think Clojure is at a significant disadvantage to CL in this field. If anything, it's at an advantage in web applications, as it has access to a massive number of very good web-related and utility libraries. A paucity of modern, battle tested libraries that ""work everywhere"" has always been Common Lisp's achilles heel.",1260035244

On something like this that might be used a couple times a year, no.<p>The real issue is you need to get more useful information onto the front page. The ""number of ideas"" column is next to useless. What does it mean that a designer has zero ideas? That their head is completely empty? I doubt it. It probably means they aren't necessarily looking to work on a specific project they have in mind. But then, on the other hand, maybe there are some designers who chose '0' because they really, truly, have absolutely no ideas (and, by implication, no creativity). I would want to avoid those. How do I know which are which? I don't. And if the number of ideas listed is 1, 2, or more, similar opportunities for confusion abound.

978251,comment,978124,978139,0,0,btilly,,,"Your understanding is incomplete.  Bayesian statistics are not subjective at all.  Instead they objectively describe the correlation between prior belief and conclusion.  People may draw different conclusions for subjective reasons, but that subjectivity is in the people, not the statistics.<p>Now it seems you are objecting to the fact that your initial state of mind affects your conclusion.  But it is unavoidable that there is no way to make sense of observation except through the lens of prior beliefs.  You can be explicit about it and draw conclusions with a correct methodology about it as in Bayesian statistics.  You can be implicit about it and draw conclusions with an incorrect methodology as in frequentist statistics.  (See my other post in this thread for an explanation of why frequentist methodology is incorrect.)<p>Let me offer a simple example.  Suppose a pregnant woman you know gives birth to a boy.  Is that evidence that babies are more likely to be boys than girls?  Obviously it is.  Is it strong evidence?  Obviously not.  Should we upon observing that conclude that boys are more likely than girls?  Obviously not.<p>Now suppose that you have no prior knowledge other than we see about similar numbers of boys and girls.  I know that of the last 100,000 babies born in the USA, 51,157 are boys.  Suppose we are both told that at the local hospital, 92 of the last 200 babies born were boys.  I submit that we both will <i>and should</i> wind up with different conclusions about the relative likelyhood of boys and girls.  Why?  Because different prior knowledge lead to different prior beliefs, and those prior beliefs when modified by identical evidence lead to different conclusions.",1260032775
978250,comment,978124,978124,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"I get lost in the argument with these simple coin flipping examples. The way it's presented is so confusing for the weird second case of how many trials it takes to get a tail.<p>In the first case, the probability of getting ""five tails or more"" from a fair coin is 11%, while in the second case, the probability of a fair coin requiring ""at least five tails before seeing one heads"" is 3%.<p>I didn't check the numbers here, but this seems perfectly reasonable to me in terms of hypothesis testing.  He's playing on the fact that for cases like THXXXX you would get a result of 2 in the second experiment. You are taking the same results, but applying a different metric to them (position of first head versus count of tails). Of course p will be different.<p>I understand that the value chosen for significance of p is subjective, but the experiment itself makes perfect sense to me.",1260032754

I have had friends who have lost over 50% of their retirement funds in the last two years - they tend to be more realists than other friends and family members who get (or will get) government pensions. The pensioners tend to have faith in the US and local governments that seems to me to be outside the bounds of clear thought and common sense.<p>I may be over simplifying this, but I think that in addition to the obvious greed and avarice of the elites, that we have a basic problem with fear. Fear can keep a society from making sacrifices now rather than postponing the pain and making the future more difficult.<p>I think that the next ten years will be interesting to live through (in negative and in positive ways) but facing problems head on seems like a better approach to what our leaders are doing now.",1260032753

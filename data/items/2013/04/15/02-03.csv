Over time, many smaller pieces of information can accrue into an understandable whole, providing context for future experiences and information. If you never end up understanding the information thrown at you, or consume garbage news, then yeah, it won't help. It's possible you need to ingest a lot of background material to really make sense of the news in a useful and non-helplessness-inducing way.<p>The news to me is incremental history, economics, and political science. I wouldn't watch low-content information like daily TV news, but that's not the only option.<p>That said, you don't have to do it all the time, because sometimes, in your topic of interest, nothing much happens for a while...

This resulted in 30% unemployment and a very high multiplier. Additionally Weimar Germany was on brink of civil war in the end.<p>Hitler then did introduce the Reichsarbeitsdienst, essentially forced but payed labor for the unemployed. And he did ramp up spending, first mostly for infrastructure later shifting to the military. [2] And he was rather reckless in consolidating his power, which probably lead to increased 'investor confidence.' With these policies he managed to get more than 5% real GDP growth each year, [3] together with steeply falling unemployment. [4] ( Wikipedia has an article with more details. [5])<p>And this is probably the reason why this is rarely addressed, economic policy was an area where Hitler did have some success, at least by modern metrics which are not easily applicable.

5549454,comment,5548730,5549404,14,0,zanny,,,"ISPs and cell service are exactly what happens <i>when</i> government gets involved. Power plants are actually <i>less</i> regulated.<p>Cell service is compeltely broken because the government ""sold"" radio frequency spectrum. They sold all of it. Now there is none left to sell or distribute. And now a few concentrated companies own the <i>rights</i> (another government construct) to broadcast on <i>their</i> frequencies. So there is a rigged, no competition market, because you can't erect cell towers and broadcast on <i>any</i> frequency anymore (at least those viable for cell service) because someone owns that frequency band.<p>ISPs, again, are poor government intervention - almost all of the ground wires were laid under government subsidy upwards of a hundred years ago for some phone channels, so all the current private owners of coax / phone lines almost exclusively got them <i>from</i> government that already laid them, and rarely ever lays them themselves (and when they do, they do slight extensions to already established backbone, they aren't laying it themselves).<p>In addition, these private providers will contract with local governments to provide <i>exclusive</i> service, and will bribe the town council to block competition from laying their own lines (or heavens forbid, the township itself own the fucking wires running under their streets). As a result, you <i>can't</i> lay your own cable / fiber / phone lines (unless you are Google and have billions of political pressure) and even if you could, you are at an insurrmountable competitive disadvantage because not only does your competition already have all their wire laid decades ago, they can readily drop their prices to run you out of the market because they have barely any overhead in providing your service. They are making hand over fist profit off of consistent customers that are paying year on end. And <i>then</i>, there is inertia, and market manipulation by the established players, to make ""average joes"" not consider switching providers.<p>On the other end of the spectrum, it is federally regulated that power companies need to be contractable, in that you can select the company you get ""power"" from, even though the actual power lines are carrying juice from a thousand plants at any one time, and a lot of peoples homes are feeding back into the system. It is also regulation that enables average joes to set up their own solar panels / wind turbine / generator and get reimbursed any power they feed back into the system - if power companies could do whatever they wanted, they would prevent their customers from setting up their own power backup since it hurts their profits.<p>In the end, it is not very complex I think - even though the examples can be - if you stifle the ability for new players to enter a market, easily, and compete with the established ones (be it through insurmountable subsidized initial investment to enter the market, actual law book regulation preventing it, or rigged business code favoring the monopoly) you direly hurt the economy by creating artificial monopolies.<p>Even if the monopolies do ""reasonably"" well (NASA, for example, basically prevented private space investment because for 30 years it was hugely funded by taxpayers to own the sector, AT&T owned phone service for 60 years by government mandate, etc) markets with only one player (don't even look further than personal computing or the Linux world - there was barely any innovation in GCC until Clang came along to provide competition, or how Firefox had to get a lot faster when Chrome became a real competitor). Competition drives innovation, and in <i>any</i> situation where you facilitate a one man market, you <i>will</i> starve innovation and improvement just by only having one force in the market, even if they have good intentions.<p>Competition is <i>essential</i> to progress. It is the fuel that produces a <i>huge</i> amount of improvement in every field and business. So if a government is going to craft any law, it should be to make new competition easier to found and enter a market with, not harder. The electric grid regulation makes it easier to enter the market (even if the individual power sources are heavily regulated / zoned / mandated, and the status of a player against a power company only exists for consumers to power co, not business to power co, etc - there is a lot of regulatory cruft behind the respectable outer cover) and as a result promotes competition and better prices for the consumer (the ability to ""shop"" your power company in a state is a <i>huge</i> reason US power costs are so much lower than elsewhere in the world).<p>It is why almost <i>all</i> the innovation right now is in web / computers. It is barely regulated, extremely easy to enter the market, and as a result a disproportionate amount of ideas go into it (even when other fields cry for innovation, like medicine, agriculture, telecom, etc) because the market is <i>free</i> and as a result it is <i>healthy</i>.",1365993876

I'd say the majority of funding is for paid subscription based SaaS web apps and software, stuff that manages some part of the enterprise, analytics, advertising optimization, security, backups, data management, etc. etc.  See, for instance, one first tier venture firm's portfolio - <a href=""http://www.generalcatalyst.com/companies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.generalcatalyst.com/companies</a><p>However, the point remains that few VC funded companies are attacking the areas that have the most potential for raising quality of life.

Software has a much greater potential for generating the high profits of natural monopoly with relatively low capital investment costs.  Cleantech simply does not provide the same returns.<p>In reality, the solution may be more Solyndras.  Maybe we need some public institution - government or philanthropic - to grant loans at a 2 to 1 match for equity investment in companies that are tackling socially useful problems.  Many of these companies will fail.  But the knowledge, know how, and personal experience generated will create the base for the next round of companies, or the round of companies after that, to create products that change the world.  But currently it is not rational for VC's to play the long game, because there is little chance than any particular company they invest in will capture the value created by new innovations.  Since much the result of the product will end up as consumer surplus/public surplus, it makes sense that the public contribute to the initial funding if the public wants the investment to happen.",1365993846

5549445,comment,5549054,5549283,3,0,carleverett,,,"About your last paragraph.  It has always puzzled and bothered me that there is this popular notion that to truly understand the world is to be miserable and hopeless - that there exists this trade-off between knowledge and happiness.<p>For me, the one blinding truth that exists about humanity is its undeniable progress on the grand timescale.  You won't find anyone arguing really that we are worse off now than we were 100 years ago.  I'm talking about the extremely basic progress indicator of the average quality of life of a human being on Earth (which is of course mostly subjective).  Expand the timescale back beyond 100 years, and our progress just becomes more and more clear.  We are so much better than we were 500 years ago in every single aspect of living on this planet:  health care, wealth distribution, civil rights, freedom, scientific discovery, overall happiness... There is not a single aspect of humanity that was better back then.<p>I should note that a huge reason our progress is not always as evident within 100 years is this pattern of people's adamant belief that the generation below them is somehow screwing up the world forever.  Technology is making people stupid/socially retarded, music these days sucks, no one cares about other people anymore, blah blah blah.  I could talk for hours about how much I hate this, but I'll just say that it is incorrect, and aspects of that idea that are true stem from the fact that younger people are generally stupider than older people, because they haven't lived as much.  Everyone was once stupid, and ""Kids these days"" will eventually learn, like everyone does.<p>If you let yourself become affected by the misery and despair that is definitely still around us on Earth, then in my opinion you are a part of the problem.  You may not be Joseph Kony or Kim Jong-Un, but you are contributing just as much to the fear and hopelessness on Earth by becoming a part of it.  And you are short-sited.  The world is certainly not perfect, but it is also most certainly getting better.  The most knowledgeable people on this planet are optimistic.

Now, this sort of read may not be everyone's thing, and as with most philosophy books in the French tradition (think Deleuze & Guattari) , it often tries too hard.... but it's a provocative way of looking at how Internet protocol architecture and its resulting conflict patterns are starting to bleed into real world politics  -- e.g. the control that others have over you by remaining connected vs. the power of being disconnected;  ""exploits"" as the new dominant form of resistance against the power of protocols to control, etc.    I'm not doing it justice here, but may be a good read if you're at all interested in postmodern philosophy (other than to laugh at, or justify the first two Matrix movies...  which admittedly, is mostly what the discipline is good for).",1365992088

I am a H-1B holder on my <i>second</i> US-based startup now. The process for getting a H-1B is the same regardless of if your sponsor is Microsoft or Startup.ly.<p>Hiring H-1Bs is so common for startups that there is no shortage of immigration law firms to service companies that don't have the size to do it internally. I can rattle of a list of five firms I've worked with in the past off the top of my head.<p>The only real problem with hiring H-1Bs for startups is the long lead time required. For massive companies with predictable aggregate growth, they can afford to hire someone early in the year and have them start October 1st - for many startups that long gap is impossible since the need for people is more immediate and acute. I'm generally of the notion that the once-a-year cycle for H-1Bs would be much better served by moving to a month-by-month model - which would help smaller companies enormously.<p>> <i>""The established companies in question usually pay millions and millions to hire the first tech worker""</i><p>This is not true. I make it a point to look at at much paperwork as I can when I deal with immigration-related matters. The cost for a visa is in the mid thousands, not millions. Like I've said before, there is no shortage of immigration law firms that do this work, there is absolutely no need to set up your own internal legal department to handle immigration unless your sheer size warrants it.<p>> <i>""putting tech worker visas up to bid would be good for tech workers, good for startups, good for R&D focused companies""</i><p>I disagree. In fact I believe that auctioning work visas will only serve to create the future you're most afraid of - the one where massive companies corner the bulk of the visas. It will also serve the re-create the foul situation we've only just now started to untangle re: indentured servitude and the H-1B visa.<p>We've seen in the past where the nature of green card applications allows employers to hold their employees over a barrel. We've seen contracts that resemble indentured servitude where the payout for the employee is a green card. We've seen tech workers terrorized by managers by having their immigration status constantly lorded over them. It's positively Dickensian and dystopian.<p>It is still a reality for many, though with reforms in the green card application process, it is thankfully getting better.<p>So now we dramatically raise the bar on work visa costs, which will only serve to create an alternate avenue for this sort of behavior. Want to come work in the US? MegaCorp will outbid everyone else, and in exchange MegaCorp corners the entire international talent market and gets everybody on a 10-year contract with insane termination clauses (not to mention being shipped back home). A lighter version of this is already reality for many people in the tech industry - this isn't just wild fantasy.<p>The only losers here are the startups who don't have the sheer cash power to fight the big corporations, and who do not have the means of signing employment contracts with a 10-year horizon. Oh, and the tech workers, who will work in conditions once thought to only exist in Industrial Revolution England.<p>I'm all for muscling Infosys and WiPro out of the talent-importation market, but there has got to be a better way.",1365991846

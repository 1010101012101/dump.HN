A lot of money right now seems to go towards adding shiny new things to attract more students (e.g. newer buildings, more tech, nicer chairs, etc). The only thing stopping them from charging more is competition, but so few students even check the cost of their education that it isn&#x27;t working well, and many are geographically restricted.<p>Community college is where people go if they actually care at all about the costs. Or at least they get 2/3rds of their education done at a CC.<p>If I was in charge I&#x27;d attack this problem as follows:<p>- College loans are now provided by the US Government only at an interest rate DESIGNED to break even (i.e. no longer for-profit).<p>- Loans are repaid as a tax (for people who remain in the US, like a debt for people abroad).<p>- No repayment is required under a certain threshold (e.g. $30K single, 50K family, in 2015 dollars).<p>- Repayment schedules scale similar to income tax (e.g. you MUST repay faster the more you make).<p>- Loans are not subject to bankruptcy and are treated like a tax for inheritance purposes (i.e. paid back first).<p>- Under certain circumstances interest can be frozen (e.g. documented medical issues, natural disasters, continued education, etc).<p>This means that unemployment or illness isn&#x27;t as damaging. People who leave college and get low paying jobs aren&#x27;t hurt as badly day to day (although might technically have an outstanding loan for the rest of their life).",1444074768

US cars were virtually crippled in the 70s due to NOx standards (power-robbing EGR valves being the main culprit, IIRC). For example, the high-end version of the Chevrolet Camaro in 1976 was getting 165bhp out of a 350ci V8 small block (for comparison, I think the plain Jane 2015 Corvette my parents just bought puts out 450bhp from the modern version of that engine).

Traditionally, for many jurisdictions, circumventing DRM is typically reserved for civil penalties. Criminal penalties implies that the government would foot the bill for enforcement. In civil cases, it is typically rights holders that go after individuals.<p>... civil damages do apply. How much are civil damages if an alleged infringer is found guilty? Well, that is up to rights holders, not a judge. Prosecution is able to determine the damages and a judge would have to accept whatever number comes out regardless of evidence to the contrary. A good example might be that a song may be sold for 99 cents, but the damages sought could be in the millions for all the prosecutors are concerned.<p>... an act of copyright infringement as set forth in this “trade” agreement doesn’t actually have to occur before the authorities are sent after you. There just has to be evidence that infringement is taking place or is about to take place.<p>... if you have a cell phone, and you have something on it that could be considered infringing, authorities have the right to seize it because you are suspected of trafficking. Of course, you could also be liable for civil and criminal penalties as earlier outlined and could be fined any amount copyright holders feel like.<p>... you could be fined on the spot because of your cell phone on top of it all.

Obama&#x27;s guards going off to sleep with prostitutes (and stiff them at that) is a great symbol for the US/Colombian relationship.<p>Jorge Eliécer Gaitán looked like he was going to become president of Colombia in 1948, so he was murdered by someone supporting the Colombian establishment.  This led over time to a series of events (and US intervention) which caused FARC to arise.  In 1984, FARC desired to stop its armed campaign, which had wide support among southern Colombian peasants, and enter politics.  This was not something desired by Colombia&#x27;s establishment or Reagan, and thousands of left-wingers were murdered in Colombia, including all left wing presidential candidates.  In 1987, FARC picked up the armed struggle.  The Colombian elite and US response to leftists in Colombia entering politics is to murder them.  Just like when leftists in Chile were murdered like Salvador Allende on September 11, 1973.  The Chilean establishment and US answer even elected government&#x27;s like Allende&#x27;s with violence and murder.<p>The mujahideen is another example.

It goes like this, verified prices today:<p>* Web + smartphone = $3.75<p>* Web + tablet = $5<p>* &quot;All Digital Access&quot; (web+smartphone+tablet) = $3.75 + $5 = $8.75<p>That&#x27;s right. Not only do they not provide an incentive (a per-unit discount) for buying multiple products, they actually charge you <i>more money</i> for buying all of their stuff. Obviously, it makes little sense to the average consumer to have to pay >$0 in order to add a smartphone to their web+tablet subscription, but the insistence that you pay again for the FULL web + smartphone cost just to add a smaller screen is asinine.<p>Second gripe has been they devalue their content so much by these stupid 99 cent teaser rates, which automatically tell me I don&#x27;t want to do business with them.<p>Third gripe is that they are so dependent on dead-tree revenue that it&#x27;s often cheaper to buy a print subscription and get free &quot;free&quot; internet content. I don&#x27;t want to provide a nonstop stream of paper to the recycling bin just to get cheaper digital access.<p>In the past few months, they experimented with their pricing model, and I ended up as a subscriber because they got rid of their double-charging system, and provided a fair, low, consistent rate.<p>Unfortunately, upon posting a screenshot on Facebook, I found out that nobody was able to replicate my success -- they seemed to be arbitrarily handing out different pricing models as a test when different people clicked on the same link. Many others were able to verify the non-double-charging pricing model, but nobody got as low a rate as I could manage.<p>Turns out they&#x27;re back to their same old tricks -- I validated the above pricing today with a fresh browser.<p>I apologize for how vague I am about the exact &quot;new&quot; model I ended up with a couple of months ago, but I can&#x27;t track down the screenshots of the different schemes I was offered.<p>Also, my apologies about the poor formatting.

A web site with a million of those page views a day, would bring in $90,000 a month.<p>Piracy, and articles on the web, is a mismatch between what the content provider <i>thinks</i> something is worth, and what something is <i>really</i> worth. If you artifically price it above what people think it is worth, you get piracy. If you provide a way for market dynamics to price it and capture the value you can see what it is <i>really</i> worth.<p>So rather an author saying &quot;This article is worth $10,000&quot; you throw out that article into a networked system which has millions of &quot;small&quot; votes, all articles compete for votes based on their value to the community. Value wins.<p>And like Netflix where a movie that is a dog may not make any more revenue by being part of the instant catalog, articles that aren&#x27;t actually valuable won&#x27;t suddenly have value by participating in this market. Conversely, articles that <i>do</i> have value, will automatically do very well financially.",1444073882

Those service members and their families then use that money to purchase other services. This helps bolster the overall american economy.<p>the government pays contractors to provide all the food/water/clothing/bullets/office equipment/communication equipment/whatever needed to conduct war. This creates jobs, which helps the american economy.<p>the government contracts flights from  airlines to transport troops to and from warzones. this creates more jobs and helps bolster the airline industry.<p>the government purchased those bombs from a manufacturer using tax dollars: also could be phrased as the government creating jobs in the bomb manufacturing industry. Those people working in the bomb manufacturing industry then go and spend their wages on other things, like food, clothing, apps, computers, etc. That is useful to the nation.<p>another benefit: intimidating other countries. Don&#x27;t go to war with america, we&#x27;ll bomb the shit out of you and you will die. to use a common phrase, &quot;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&quot; this is beneficial to the nation.<p>another benefit: the military gains experience in war, which will be a large benefit if the US ends up going to war against a real country. veteran armies historically have a large advantage against rookie armies.<p>another benefit: the threat of force (or protection against other forces) can be used to enter into treaties with other states that are not directly involved. Look at NATO: literally a treaty between nations in order to gain protection from America against the Soviets.  NATO has provided a large benefit to the nation. Pax Americana is a real thing.<p>another benefit: technological development. DARPA is a government program that is designed to fund new technologies. Its overall goal is to keep the US military at the technological forefront, but its side effects are greatly beneficial to the populace at large: GPS (a single example among many) is a direct result of DARPA. this provides a huge benefit to the american (and the world&#x27;s) people.<p>so yes, you are right that the purchase of that single bomb at whatever cost probably wasn&#x27;t worth it. but the overall system of purchasing and using bombs and the logistics of delivering those bombs to a warzone and the entire network of individuals that are needed to invent, manufacture, deliver, load, use, and whatever else is needed, is what really benefits the american people.",1444073834

Their success or failure does not depend on terrorism.<p>Second bias might be exclusion of successful terrorism that is later legitimized. For example, are IZL and Stern Gang included? I would say that they were highly successful. How about Stalin and early communists in Russia? If terrorists have enough support and are successful early, terrorism turns into ethnic cleansing and/or revolution and it is taken out from the list.<p>Third problem is that terrorism seems by definition be the underdog because official or state terrorism is excluded.

No doubt you run analytics on your site to track who goes to which pages and which pages generate the most advertising revenue. In my experience the &quot;landing&quot; page gets a lot of traffic, the &quot;spokes&quot; pages (typically branches to a bunch of related content) come next, and then there are the articles, some of which get a lot of traffic and some which get only a few page views a day/week. You also probably track dwell time so that you can recognize people who land on the page, probably from a Search engine result, and then &quot;bounce&quot; off because it wasn&#x27;t what they wanted. Or stay and read. Or the unicorn of the bunch, stay, read, and then read a bunch of other pages.<p>I&#x27;ve also been an author in both the print and web world, my columns on JavaWorld continue to get page views and I continue to get various folks popping over to my poorly maintained web site to grab a copy of the sources. While I&#x27;m sure there are probably people who have read my BYTE and Dr. Dobbs articles that is harder to track long term.<p>The point being that I&#x27;m pretty familiar with the space and if you&#x27;re looking for median values for revenue for a given article, its &quot;large&quot; and it became small enough to result in folks like Dr. Dobbs dropping out entirely. Web <i>page</i> revenue, which generally represents one article for a journalist, is &quot;good&quot; if it has $3 RPMs and that is super great if it is getting a lot of traffic.<p>Number 2, the web <i>is</i> often times &quot;one and done&quot; for <i>articles</i>, not web <i>sites</i> but web <i>articles</i>. So if you&#x27;re a journalist or an author that has a loyal following, folks will come back and read <i>new</i> articles that appear, but they don&#x27;t generally read the <i>same</i> article again and again.[1] Given that you&#x27;re running a site, and no doubt you have analytics on that site, how many times does the same person come back to an article? What is the 25th, 50th, and 99th percentiles? If you&#x27;re 99th percentile breaks 1.15 I&#x27;m going to be super impressed.<p>So lets unpack #3, the money shot (no pun intended)<p>Lets start with your writer who was paid $100 to create an article[2]. Setting aside the unreality of someone doing their best work in 4 hours, you have to consider how information gets &quot;value&quot; to consumers, there really is only a few ways, it&#x27;s &quot;rare&quot; (which means few alternate sources), it&#x27;s &quot;timely&quot; (which means alternate sources don&#x27;t have it yet), or it&#x27;s &quot;enriched&quot; (which means the information contributes to a bigger understanding). So how much <i>value</i> is your author creating here? Do they have the inside scoop on a big deal? Or maybe they are the first with the complete picture, or maybe they have been following a topic for years and can put it all in perspective for people just coming into contact with this thing or concept. That is what creates <i>value</i> in the piece. If they are paraphrasing an AP press release? (or any press release for that matter), or adding a bit of irrelevant trivia to a bigger story, or regurgitating something which has been covered by 16 other authors already in different ways, there is very little in the way of &quot;value&quot; in that writing.<p>Information can demand a price commensurate with its value. While people complain that the NYTimes is a &quot;paywall&quot; they have reached 1M digital subscribers today. Those are people who have paid them money because they expect the value of the information they will get out of the NYTimes will be high relative to the price.<p>So let us look a bit critically at your numbers. <i>&quot;They would need 30k readers to pay 1/3 of a cent in order to break even just on the cost of the article. That is absolutely insane and impossible for most articles.&quot;</i><p>Fred Langa, who was the Editor-in-Chief at BYTE advised me as follows when I wrote for him, &quot;Chuck, the idea article for us would interest all our readers, but that only rarely happens, you should shoot for being interesting to 1/2 to 3/4ths of the readership.&quot; Their subscription base was a couple of million readers, so that was targeting 1.5M people.<p>There are over a billion people who use the Web today, a large fraction get most of their information from it. If you&#x27;re unable to get 30K page views for an article, then I would suggest that either the information it contained was not valuable, or that nobody knew of its existence.<p>The second thing working in your favor today is that the Web never forgets. If you want to read an article of mine in BYTE you have either find a reprint or find some kind soul who has scanned it into the web. But if it was online to begin with (like my Javaworld columns) then people find them again and again and again. Some of those have over 5 million page views. And that is over 20 years. So you write something today, and then it can live forever for pennies a day (a Digital Ocean web server to serve it up is $5/month which can be amortized over all the things you are keeping alive on the web).<p>If you&#x27;re going to write on the web to make money, make it something worthwhile to a million people. Not three or four thousand. If you are just passionate about something feel free to spend all your time writing about it, that is its own reward and any remuneration is just bonus.<p>[1] The exception for fan fiction is noted.<p>[2] I don&#x27;t think that would be a particularly good investment in time unless someone was just passionate about what they are writing about.",1444072635

Maybe. The Internet and BGP is built on mutual respect. You can and sometimes will filter certain routes from certain uplinks/providers to change how routing happens from your network onto the next hop, but overall there is no authentication, and no authorization.<p>Anyone that has an AS, and has a peer that is willing to accept their routes, can advertise whatever they want.<p>As for how many there are? How many CCNA/CCNP/CCIE&#x27;s are there out there? How about comparable certs for Juniper/Alcatel Lucent and whatnot. Each of them could potentially be a BGP admin. It&#x27;s not a difficult job. When I worked at a large ISP I remember announcing some new IP&#x27;s out from our AS to the world from a new location and watching it propagate across the world. Had me and my colleague made one little typo we could have accidentally announced the wrong thing.<p>The only controls are policies that are set up by each AS for what routes they will or will not accept from a neighbouring AS. In general this is an accept all. Then the AS can choose to re-advertise it&#x27;s received routes from it&#x27;s neighbours to it&#x27;s other neighbours, this is how route propagation works. You can also choose for example to receive routes from a neighbour but not re-advertise them (i.e. you don&#x27;t become transit).<p>BGP changes happen every minute of every day. Routes get added, get removed, and those things propagate.

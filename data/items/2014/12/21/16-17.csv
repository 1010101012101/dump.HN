Often, it is extremely important for scientific experiments to be anonymous in order to make sure that any decision taken by the participants cannot have any adverse consequences for them outside the experiment (i.e. by damaging their reputation).

8780140,comment,8780014,8780014,0,0,bane,,,"If you can do it, take some time off and see if you can take a small project from inception to completion. It&#x27;s harder than it seems, especially as a solo person, but you&#x27;ll learn a lot from it. Spend some time trying to get users to learn about marketing and sales. Even if you don&#x27;t succeed, those skills (full product life-cycle, marketing and sales) become very marketable resume points.<p>I&#x27;m also of the opinion that it&#x27;s good to spend some time in the trenches at a big tech company to better appreciate the differences between small startups and mega-corps (and if you can something in between). It&#x27;s one thing to read about it and get an idea, it&#x27;s another thing to experience it and understand better what the pros/cons of each environment are. If you end up at another growing startup, this experience will better help you understand what&#x27;s happening to the organization as it grows. Too many founders end up with growing organization and don&#x27;t understand what a big shop looks like or how it functions and end up dragging the potential of the company down around them.<p>Both of those experiences can become very valuable to any future career direction you choose: small startup, on your own, big software house. If you&#x27;re missing one or two of those, it&#x27;s hard to say you have a complete picture.<p>Alternately, 6 months is really not a lot of time to learn and observe. Startups always go through lots of rapid changes, but seeing some of those through to completion (or stagnation) can be very informative. You&#x27;re young enough that another year or so there won&#x27;t kill you and won&#x27;t prevent you from pursuing anything you want after that.

Salaries are a closely guarded secret and they maintain that informational advantage against you. So, you really have to look at industry averages for your role and decide if you are not being appropriately compd.<p>Not sure about other places but everywhere I&#x27;ve been, this is simply official policy but in reality, employees talk. While it&#x27;s not always exact, I can pretty accurately say who gets paid what with a fairly slim margin of error. Keeping salaries a secret seems more for the benefit of the company who may or may not be unfairly compensating their employees for not-so-good reasons (not saying there isn&#x27;t other benefits). That bit has without a doubt been key in determining, since salaries can greatly vary between companies, regions, etc.<p>> Now, about mgmt valuing you and not letting you go. First, NEVER threaten to leave.<p>Agreed, and this is certainly not a tactic in my arsenal because I generally like where I work and respect my managers. I have gone outside to get offers and came back with that as leverage in case things didn&#x27;t work out, and that&#x27;s how I ended up where I am today. That seems to be the best option since you never quite know what is going on in management&#x27;s head once they know you&#x27;re unhappy.<p>Honestly I think in the case of the larger companies, managers have their hands tied by upper management or HR and aren&#x27;t really willing to put their skin on the line, something I can&#x27;t really blame them for for obvious reasons.",1419179893

One, that its a negotiation and you have to be very careful in your communications and diligent about protecting your own interests.<p>As an employee you&#x27;re at a built-in disadvantage.  Management knows everyone&#x27;s salaries, you don&#x27;t.  Salaries are a closely guarded secret and they maintain that informational advantage against you.\nSo, you really have to look at industry averages for your role and decide if you are not being appropriately compd.<p>Now, about mgmt valuing you and not letting you go.  First, NEVER threaten to leave.  They may preempt that and cut you, or you&#x27;ll go on a list of troublemakers.  Managers have lists of people in their heads they would like to cut if given the opportunity.  It&#x27;s the people that get cut whenever there is a layoff, when teams have to be downsized.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand mgmt&#x27;s perspective.  They have dozens of people in slots to get things done.  No one person is indispensable, especially at the staff level where most programmers are.  A slot goes open, they fill it.  I&#x27;ve worked with managers with the biggest hearts, good guys, not mean spirited or unappreciative of their employees at all.  They will not necessarily blink twice when an employee says they&#x27;ll walk.<p>I would say, if you have a good case you&#x27;re under compd, or unhappy.  NICELY go to mgmt.  If they won&#x27;t do anything, get an offer from another company.  Then you have the choice to just leave, or go back to your company and you have leverage and then its going to essentially be an ultimatum to keep you.  But be very nice and polite about it.",1419178609

I respect that he respected M3 creator&#x27;s wishes.<p>You&#x27;re quite right in an ideal universe. Ours is far from that. The code for the project is out there, so if someone does not want to pay the programmer, then they will reimplement it in house and no one will ever know about it period. If on the other hand they prefer the port, then there must be a good reason for it such as better compatibility/maintainability/performance/etc.<p>Now let&#x27;s go to the ideal universe. Well, if everyone abides the rules, then the project creator effectively contaminated other programmers. If someone interested in solving the same problem examined the code thoroughly, then they are influenced by the solution and that is perfectly reasonable because they looked at the code thinking it is under BSD licence. Now that they know they are influenced by the program, they are ethically obliged to avoid solving the problem or they would be infringing author&#x27;s &quot;copyright&quot; (that is despite the fact that you cannot copyright an algorithm).",1419178435

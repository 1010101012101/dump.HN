Besides basic office duties they were useless in the home, except to geeks who didn&#x27;t mind pecking out simple programs that were forgotten when the machine powered down (or often before!)<p>Then the models got speeds beyond 2400 baud and netcom and such sprang up and suddenly in the home computers did a little more. There was gopher and nntp and email and you could poke around in the shell accounts for hours of fun. Finally mosaic became nutscrape and the web exploded and suddenly everyone and everything had a &quot;home page&quot;. Things looked touch and go for a while as AOL tried to ruin it, but they went poof with their time warner friends around the turn of the century and couldn&#x27;t (like many companies, including excite) figure out if they were a media or tech company. Thankfully around that time windows was getting a proper tcpip stack and we didn&#x27;t need to be nerds and figure out winsock settings anymore. Then, and not really until then, were computers viable for regular people at home (no excite pun intended.) there was games (ms flight sim for example) and proper word processing packages, even quark express for &quot;DTP&quot; and there was an embryonic web, bbs, the well, aol, yahoo, pointcast...",1401505164

7825008,comment,7824570,7824744,23,0,airplane,,,"I don&#x27;t know anything about Rust, but things I disliked about Ada (besides horrendous tooling support, free or paid) are:<p>- Complex language that isn&#x27;t matched with an equally complex language standard (a lot of undefined behaviors or gaps where things are not explained as fully as they could be, but I don’t remember any specific instances, so maybe I&#x27;m crazy on this one)<p>- Too many situations with the syntax where you can do something only in certain situations, or the opposite. From what I see the only possible reason why in these bizarre situations is to lower the complexity of the compiler. For example, why can&#x27;t I put a package instance in an array, when the generic package features are so strong that they can be pretty much (ab)used as object oriented structs. Try to search in Barnes&#x27; Ada book for terms like, only when, except when, however.<p>- Reuse of keywords that mean very different or slightly different things in one context versus another. An example would be delay, two lines of code might say delay 10, one actually means sleep the task for 10 seconds, the other means goto the next line of code if one of the previous points of entry in the lines above is called.<p>- The ability to tiptoe very easily around the safety mechanics of the language and start using it as if it was C, which is very tempting for two reasons:\n    1. Most programmers programming Ada were/are from a C background and the first things they pick up on are the ways to do things in Ada like you could in C while never moving on past that. It makes sort of sense to not move pass that if you aren&#x27;t given time to fully digest the Ada way of doing things.\n    2. Takes less lines of code to program something up if you ignore the all the safety features that language can provide.\nI would have not allowed the ability to ignore all the things that make Ada stand out. It makes sense to not use Ada for any development, because programming C in Ada is going to be slower than programming C in C any day of the week.<p>- Hacked on OO. Can hardly find any Ada code online using OO language features added in Ada 95, but that makes sense because it&#x27;s a bunch of keyword boilerplate on top of the existing records that&#x27;s very unwieldy to use and ugly.<p>On the topic of Ada not taking off, I think one big reason why Ada can&#x27;t take off the ground right now is that you can&#x27;t find anything online about it. Try to search for some question you have, you&#x27;ll find no answers, search the same question but pertaining to the Java or C version, and you’ll get a bunch of answers, blogs, even unanswered questions, Ada lacks that web presence greatly. Where are people going to talk about Ada and develop modern tools for it and frameworks in it if such places don’t exist? (comp.lang.ada is the only location on the internet with an active Ada community) It seems like that can only appear out of thin air if the language is new, where a sudden influx of many individuals feel like they can contribute where their energies are combined together, but if you get an individual here and there that wants to help out, but their energies are separated by one week or one month, then nothing for Ada will ever come about.<p>On the topic of concurrency, you may want to look into Ada on that too, concurrent structures are baked into the syntax of the Ada language, and can be quite complex/powerful/concise.",1401502035

Its not very good for teaching programming to someone who has no idea what they&#x27;re doing, but after much more experience, I can appreciate the language for what it is and what it can do.<p>And yes, I do realize that the verbosity and safety are good qualities and certainly can teach a lot, but for a 17/18 year old who may have never seen a programming language before, its pretty crazy.  It should definitely be taught at higher levels, so as to reinforce good programming standards and practices.

In what other arena do you see people taking sides and insulting each other about stuff that pretty much does the same thing, no matter which they choose? American politics.<p>The fanboy thing happens cuz personal computing is a dual party system. You're either a Mac or a PC. Or you're one of those weird 3rd party candidates who use Linux.",1209621567

It has cost thousands and thousands of man-hours of labor, and the result is something that is, at best, almost as good as what already exists (and often, what has existed for a long time). See also the *BSD's.<p>The main effect of Linux is to keep the prices of its competitors low. For any given application, you will probably find a better alternative to it which is only slightly more expensive.",1209621501

178144,comment,177995,177995,0,0,alex_c,,,"A long rant about why Apple has a fanatical following, and the word ""design"" is only mentioned once?<p>Good design is strangely lacking in the tech industry.  Sony has it (sometimes).  In the mp3 player area, IRiver had it (briefly), but it wasn't enough.  When looking for a laptop recently, I was dismayed at how plain bad most Windows laptops look (for the record, I ended up choosing between a Dell and a Sony, and went with the Sony because I didn't want to wait 2 weeks).  Microsoft is a consistent case study of how NOT to do design.  Whatever else Apple might do wrong, design isn't one of them.<p>Let me put it another way.  If the auto world only gave you two choices - '88 Ford Taurus knock-offs and Lexus - I'm willing to bet Lexus owners would be a lot more fanatical.",1209620958
178143,comment,178010,178010,0,0,zach,,,"There is a kind of obsession here, one concerned with fabricating narratives and strategies for their own sake.<p>Bill Gates used every CES keynote in recent memory to go on about the ""digital decade"" and pose ""in the year 2000"" scenarios.  Of course, this was all after <i>The Road Ahead</i>, a vision book which famously had a shorter shelf life than a bag of potato chips.<p>Apparently he's not the only one at Microsoft who suffers from this peculiar affliction.  All these strategies for a digital millennium and manifestos for an online services marketplace or whatever are laughable.  Particularly amusing is how they always find a way to drag every Microsoft business group into their vision.  Suddenly, you're supposed to believe that Halo 3 is an embodiment of Microsoft's comprehensive cloud computing paradigm.<p>Kudos to Joel on calling them on it so entertainingly.",1209620958

178126,comment,177995,177995,0,0,indiejade,,,"Good read.  My take would be that Apple is like Nike.  In grad school, one of my professors said that Nike isn't actually in the business of making shoes; it's in the business of marketing.  Makes sense.  Advertising and celebrity athlete endorsements don't really add any <i>value</i> to a pair of sneakers, but paying a celebrity athlete millions of dollars for their endorsement certainly adds to the cost, and ultimately the <i>price</i>, of the final product.<p>Quote: "". . . if they’re lucky maybe one day they’ll graduate into paying double for their computers.""<p>Interesting commentary about ""the club.""  Indeed does it seem that Apple packages and target-markets in such a way that those who are lulled into paying the premium for the ""final product"" ultimately end up doing so in order to be part of it (as in ""the club"").<p>Then, of course, are there those who are just too poor to pay membership dues to the iCool club.<p>Also are there those of us who maybe can, but don't necessarily <i>want</i> to pay double for the branded plastic, given the fact that hardware is cheap and operating systems can be free.  Even legally free.  I think a bunch of us use Linux, or some open-source variation thereof.",1209619487

The two most important factors that decide where in the range you fall are the company making the offer, and the school you graduated from.  You probably have a lot more leverage in asking for 5-10k extra if you are graduating from a place like stanford/berkeley as opposed to sjsu.

One of the reasons a lot of Western salespeople get toasted over there is that they don't appreciate the value of silence.  When you're negotiating a deal, and your client sits there silently, he is thinking, and watching you to see how you act.<p>If you patiently wait and show that you are engaged in thought, this is good.  If you keep offering more and more, just to close the deal, you will get taken to the cleaners.  And, if you press things too hard, you will be shown the door, ever so politely.<p>Just my two cents; seemed to fit, a little. <i>grin</i>",1209619079

I was lucky enough to have been raised speaking Mandarin, though my skill isn't great and I probably have a thick American accent.  donw, the traditional characters are beautiful, and easier to remember (though harder to write).  But when it comes to China in specific, I've been told that the traditional/simplified character thing strikes up the Taiwan/PROC tension.  It's a beautiful language, and there are plenty of movies that will get you to understand that. A girl I dated improved her Mandarin tonalities after we watched ""Crouching Tiger,"" of all movies. However, many of the ""mainstream"" Chinese actors we're aware of here in the US do NOT speak Mandarin as a first language, and their accents aren't very good in roles where they're forced to speak Mandarin.",1209618897

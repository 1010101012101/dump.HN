If you&#x27;re trying to simply remove offenders from circulation, that&#x27;s a different question.

However, there is nothing stopping you from looking at those files, and investigating what tools VS is calling under the hood to generate them. The individual is at fault because he&#x27;s not taking the time to learn what Visual Studio is doing and how C#/ASP.NET projects are organized. That exercise can be done independently of an IDE.

I&#x27;m gonna take that idea and run with it a bit...<p>A few things come to mind:<p>- Added complexity - apps would have two unique versions at the same time &quot;Oh i&#x27;m running gmail 15.2 with UI v 12.0&quot;<p>- I wonder if another ways of achieving something similar is keeping legacy UI by calling it a &quot;theme.&quot; While, politically, it might be difficult to get funding for a &quot;theme&quot; over a &quot;redesign,&quot; with such an important and widely used application like GMail, it makes total sense to me that there are 2-4 interaction schemas that people could use if they&#x27;d like. Maybe &quot;theme&quot; is too weak of a name,--maybe &quot;Schema&quot;? Something else?<p>- What sort of protocol would a &quot;theme&quot; use to improve? Let&#x27;s say that &quot;we want to keep the important parts of this theme as much as possible, not mess with them, just add this new feature.&quot; How universally possible is that, or do a majority of big new features inherently complicate a UI and the mental models of its users?<p>- Getting into the nitty gritty details, though, there would almost inherently be splintering--different themes would have microinteractions and microfeatures that others would not. While that&#x27;s probably good for the end user wanting to differentiate between them, it would make the &quot;Do we add big feature X?&quot; conversation across all &quot;Theme Teams&quot; AND development even more difficult.<p>- Would the themes themselves have versions?<p>- In a way, themes are already available as versions. Ex: I am running an older version (&quot;theme&quot;) of twitter on my ipad because i just haven&#x27;t gotten around to updating it. but It still works. What would be great is if twitter could allow me to switch between this version and the newest one so I could see if the newest version worked better for me. I could switch back if it didn&#x27;t. Right now, I can upgrade, but I can&#x27;t switch back, so upgrading is &quot;switching permanently and hoping for the best.&quot;<p>- what are your thoughts?",1416500838
8636493,comment,8635466,8635466,0,0,nickbaum,,,"A few thoughts:<p>* Google has a large and very competent design team. They are not changing things &quot;for the sake of changing them.&quot; More often than not, changes are made in response to issues discovered during usability studies.<p>* You are not the user. I am not the user. The designer is not the user. In fact, for a project as large as Android or Gmail, there is no &quot;the user&quot;. You&#x27;re always making trade-offs between power vs. common, new vs. existing users.<p>* Existing users are inherently conservative. By definition they mostly like things as they are or they wouldn&#x27;t be users.  You have to weigh their needs vs. those of future users. A big part of that is understanding how many people are upset about the change (all vs. vocal minority), how quickly they get used to it (if ever), and how you can mitigate this.<p>* Ideally, you want to make &quot;Pareto efficient&quot; changes, that make everyone better off. The only thing easier than doing what you&#x27;ve always done is when the new UX is so easy and intuitive you instantly understand it.<p>* You do not want to version your UI, just like you don&#x27;t want to make everything a setting. This is a recipe for maintenance headaches, and endless wasted cycles supporting an ever-shrinking minority of users.<p>* This being said, it&#x27;s very helpful to release a redesign as a beta, and let users switch back and forth for a while while you iron out the kinks. This in itself gives you good data.<p>At the end of the day, design is all about trade-offs. It&#x27;s very easy to criticize a change because you don&#x27;t like it, but it&#x27;s a lot more interesting to think through why a change might have been made. If we&#x27;re going to be critical, let us be constructive.",1416500830

The input to the SM are around 20 numbers controlling the masses of these particles and the strengths of the interactions, as well as a few Higgs parameters.  After that, everything is fixed, so that the SM makes definite predictions about where to look to find new baryons and mesons (things made out of quarks).  It&#x27;s not quite so simple as &quot;add up the masses of the constituent quarks&quot; because the strong interactions translate into mass (essentially via E=mc^2)---exactly how big an effect the strong force has requires calculation.<p>So the SM is a map telling you where to look, but a very sneaky kind of map.  In the sector where the strong force matters, it&#x27;s as if someone encrypted a map, and for every new destination you want to find out about, you have to expend computational resources to decrypt it.  In principle, you have all the information, but in practice it is hard to extract predictions from the theory.  That is a very peculiar situation for scientists to be in: to have a definite, precise theory, and the opportunity to do experiments, but to struggle to compare the two!<p>Anyway, these particles are predicted by the SM, where &quot;predicted by&quot; means after expending a lot of computation to understand the strong dynamics one finds out that these particles (which are quarks held together by gluons) should be there.",1416500532

Saying your IDE is to blame is the equivalent of saying using C to program is making you stupid because it abstracts you too far away from the underlyung architectures. Or like using the languages implementation of quicksort is bad because you don&#x27;t know how efficient it is.  IDEs are great because they can provide you with useful information about your project, and they can automate tasks, like refactoring, or setting up the boilerplate code. If you feel like you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on, then it&#x27;s up to you to understand what the IDE is doing.

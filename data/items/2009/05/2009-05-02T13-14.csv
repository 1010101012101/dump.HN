589843,comment,589481,589508,0,0,lethain,,,"Twitter search was originally another company which was purchased by twitter latter on. It recorded and indexed tweets without any magic sauce, but in a way that other developers could as well. Thus, even if search.twitter doesn't feature a given tweet, any arbitrary API user could have it, and there is no way for twitter to remove those. Thus perfection is out of reach, and even if they did delete results from search, it would be more of an act of appeasement than an actual technical solution.",1241272124
589842,comment,589428,589610,0,0,physeter,,,"You do not have to switch everything over in one step or ever. The good thing about HAML is that you can mix HAML and ERB in a single project and everything works just fine. If you want, you can gradually convert old ERB templates to HAML or you can just use HAML wherever you want and leave the old ERB code as it is.
This way you can try HAML without any risks and see if you like it or not. After the initial learning curve, HAML is really great.",1241271995
589841,comment,589481,589836,0,0,lethain,,,"Thus far they don't delete tweets from the search results even after they have been deleted within twitter itself, so I suspect they are append only as you suggest.",1241271853

Apparently Einstein had similar views, so I feel I'm in good company.<p>Society progresses only by the friction created by all those unreasonable eccentrics.",1241271711

589838,comment,589608,589656,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Einstein asked a question, the writer said he did not understand the music. Okay so most people would perhaps have just tried to ""explain"" the music in the intermissions - but I doubt that would have the same effect.<p>One of Einsteins skills was explaining logic in simple easy steps to build up a very complex picture. For me this story (be it true or not) shows his brilliant tutalege in action :)",1241271388

589836,comment,589481,589502,0,0,mustpax,,,"The search probably runs off a separate full-text index in their back-end (an inverted index if you will). When people post public tweets these probably get enqueued to be added to the index, so they will be included in search. They just need to delete all tweets from the index an account once it's made private. Maybe their index is append only, or it's very computationally expensive to remove old records (which is usually true for these data structures), so they've opted not to do this yet.",1241271022

589829,comment,589677,589766,0,0,amix,,,"Hi Damien<p>I applaud your efforts. One thing to note thought is that the market-share of Python 2.x is a lot larger than Python 3.1 - - and I think this will be the case for some time, as Python 3.x requires lots of porting.<p>It would be great if you could optimize an interpreter for web-applications - where Python is used a lot. I would be very interested in paying for an web-application optimized interpreter - - and you could probably do this optimization more generally?",1241270229
589828,comment,589809,589809,0,0,lec,,,"Why would this be news, it is not too difficult to achieve. I have been using ""Cycorder"" <a href=""http://cydia.saurik.com/info/cycorder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cydia.saurik.com/info/cycorder/</a> on my iPhone for months now and it works flawlessly. The only gotcha is that you have to have a jailbroken iPhone, and use cydia to install it but the video quality and sound quality are fine. If as the article suggests, this is a software only upgrade it is not a big deal. The article talks about doing video editing on the iPhone itself which I don't think is practical. It would be news if the next version of the iPhone had a real hi-def camera to allow to acquire HD video, however I doubt that this is apple horizon any time soon.",1241270100

Why not create different versions of browsers (then you should go to FireFox) and every browser uses it's own cookies.<p>Simply, you need to know how to hack FireFox",1241269968

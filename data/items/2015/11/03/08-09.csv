Answer: Yes, for now, until recreational stores are licensed.<p>The point is that, if and when it&#x27;s legal in most states, that should drastically reduce the demand for pot from Colorado.

A few conditions have to be met in order for a statement to qualify as FUD: 1/ It has to be false or at least grossly inaccurate, 2/ its falsehood/inaccuracy has to be intentional, and 3/ it has to be negative. My statements fulfill none of those conditions, so relax. It&#x27;s been a long time (well over a year, if not two, IIRC) since I discussed my bad experience with Scala or said anything negative about it, and for the record, I have never said that Scala is not used successfully by large teams, only that <i>I</i> have had a very bad experience adopting Scala in a large team, an experience shared by other such teams, and that I believe it may not be a good choice in such circumstances. My opinions are neither overly negative nor uncommon, the only difference is that I was foolish enough to sound them in spite of the rampant rudeness of some who for whatever reason took personal offense. I have also repeatedly said that I realize that that experience isn&#x27;t universal.<p>Also, I would appreciate you stop saying that my opinions are misinformed (as they are most certainly not), unless you care to point out my errors. It&#x27;s OK to disagree, and I don&#x27;t think you should expect everyone to share the same opinions with you.<p>BTW, I think that much of the (valid) disagreement stems from a difference in perspective. Some people concentrate on language features, while I could care less whether a language has higher-flavored emojis or subliminal piping. I view those features as means to an end, so first and foremost I care about that end -- <i>what</i> the language aims to achieve -- long before getting to <i>how</i> it aims to achieve it, which, IMO, is only a concern once the goals match your own, otherwise the discussion is purely academic (which may be interesting in its own right, but not my focus).",1446540273

10498257,comment,10495304,10496625,0,0,ptaipale,,,"Thanks for the post. Very good read.<p>When coming to work from university (1989-90), I made a somewhat similar though more primitive design for the embedded software of a redundancy controller of a satellite modem. The various tasks (control of RF and baseband electronics, display and buttons UI, network management interface, etc) would run according to a scheduler, each in turn. No dynamic memory allocation, internal communication via global variables that are written only in one place. There was no mechanism to actually enforce this, it was just the principle in code, and the enforcement was possible because it was a one-man software project so I had no one else to blame.<p>This was written in PL/M (which looks like Pascal but is more similar to a primitive variant of C) on a 8031 microcontroller, from scratch (no 3rd party SW components at all - that was a long ago).<p>Later on, I used the same platform for a design we did on a telephone/data cable modem we designed for domestic use (We saw a need for internet enabled cable modem in 1992 and started work on a thing that provided POTS and 128 kbit/s over SLIP). That was also running a 8031, but as we wanted to make it dirt cheap, the board did not have dual-port RAM. The hardware wizards made it run with a hack on the regular RAM access so that the SW could only access RAM if it read any memory location twice: first read would just place the address bits on the bus, and doing another read would actually fetch the content. This enabled us to save several dollars per device.<p>(This was possible because the 8031 has an architecture which is not strictly  von Neumann design: the code and address spaces are different memory spaces and you use different CPU instructions to access the different memories, so your program memory on EPROM works normally but your data memory in external RAM does not. There&#x27;s also a small internal RAM in yet another overlapping address space which was not impacted by address bus weirdness.)<p>This is just to show what kind of strange limitations you sometimes have on the hardware in embedded devices. Unlimited virtual memory, large non-volatile storage instead of a puny i2C bus EEPROM... you just dreamed of those. Modern controllers with 4G flash are really huge compared to that, but they are still far below what people have on desktop computers, or even an Android phone.<p>The limitations in embedded devices indeed come from cost per device as well as heat, vibration, radiation, humidity and similar environmental factors.",1446539689

At the time it was meant to be a game, but as the idea stayed in my head over the years it evolved into focusing on realism as much as possible and dropping &quot;fun&quot; from its main focus. I did not have the technical ability to build this at first in its full scope and it has gone through quite a few iterations over the years.<p>3.

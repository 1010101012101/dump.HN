Part of the deal of renting is your contract is with a single entity who takes the lion share of the responsibility: the landord/management corp.

However, I don&#x27;t agree with your second bit of advice to drop the first line and just use the &quot;clear&quot; copy.

Dont forget you only get five attempts before TouchID rejects all fingerprints requiring a PIN code to unlock it. However, lets be clear, TouchID is unlikely to withstand a targeted attack. A dedicated attacker with time and resources to observe his victim and collect data, is probably not going to see TouchID as much of a challenge. Luckily this isnt a threat that many of us face.<p>TouchID  is not a strong security control. It is a convenient security control. Today just over 50 percent of users have a PIN on their smartphones, and the number one reason people give for not using the PIN is that its inconvenient. TouchID is strong enough to protect users from casual or opportunistic attackers (with one concern I will cover later on) and it is substantially better than nothing.&quot;",1380329489

6460415,comment,6459988,6460341,4,0,mbrubeck,,,"So, you fixed the bug number, but what about my other points? Why single out Firefox when IE9+ has the same behavior and that behavior is required by the spec?  Why don&#x27;t you (or your CDN) use CORS?  Why do you say this is &quot;breaking the web&quot; when thousands of sites are using cross-domain web fonts just fine in Firefox and IE (for example, any site that uses Google Web Fonts)?<p><i>Edit: I see you added more to your comment now.</i><p>There are a few reasons to require CORS for cross-domain font loads.  One is so that you can use fonts that have single-site licenses in a way that satisfies the licensor, by not allowing other sites to use the font too without your authorization.  Another is to prevent unintended data leaks where a malicious site can deduce things about a user based on whether that user can load a font from a different site, or based on the contents of that font.  This isn&#x27;t about a known attack, but a class of attack that we know from experience is likely to crop up in the future for any type of cross-origin resource load that we allow.",1380329071

Those are very different conversations.  I had one with a stakeholder at a large organization who was worried about the physical security of my servers recently.  I told him that they were in a professionally managed datacenter, behind a gate, which required a keycard to access, and that if I showed up at the door they would turn me away because that isn&#x27;t the model at my host.  His response was, I kid you not, &quot;Oh, wow, you&#x27;re Fortune 500?  Sorry, I just have to ask that because a lot of our vendors keep the server in their home or office.&quot;",1380329016

There is very little feedback considered in most university processes.  It&#x27;s &quot;if you [student] don&#x27;t like it, too bad.&quot;  State schools offer on average less hand-holding compared to Ivys and private, which makes some sense.<p>- failure to share and integrate between departments, giving the appearance of fragmentation and more work for the served affiliates (students, faculty, staff, visitors, etc)<p>- failure to adapt to modern technologies fast enough.  I started with desktop servers connected on public IPs and Apple Newtons, and ended with rack mounted gear in real datacenters behind hardware firewalls.  The problem is partly that budget is yearly, top-down, not based on need.  Also, most departments are cost-centers, not profit-centers (we were, so we had more leverage to suggest changes).  Combine these and you get reactive capabilities devoid of marketplace competition^ that are a year behind the times, at best.  Yeah, pretty nuts for a $160 m dept.<p>^ Our customers (other departments within the same hierarchy) often owned a-la-carte discretionary funding control over our departments&#x27; projects, so there was competition because opting for outside vendors would be loss of funding and more integration work.",1380328955

Yes, it is extremely tough to make money selling iOS apps. App Store creates power law dynamics where Top 10 apps make as much money as the rest of the apps combined. If you&#x27;re in Top 10 then congrats, but most likely you won&#x27;t be. Median App Store revenue is few hundred dollars per month. iOS programmers are in demand today. It&#x27;s much easier (and in most cases more profitable) to sell your iOS expertise for $100/hr than make apps yourself.<p>2. People make money both in games and apps. So can you.<p>3. There is not such thing as too much marketing. Try every marketing technique that you can think of and can afford.<p>At the same time, no amount of marketing can rescue a bad app so you need to track conversion rates of your marketing efforts.<p>4. Free with ads vs. paid depends on your app. If you believe people will pay than go paid. If you don&#x27;t, then free with ads but you have to be realistic: ad based business requires lots of volume so if your app is not in the &quot;useful for lots of people&quot; category, ads will not make you rich.",1380328010

In a credit card transaction there are multiple parties including the issuing bank, the acquiring bank, the processor, the gateway, the card network, etc. Issuing banks in particular often return bogus error codes, time out, or have provide inconsistent results. I remember Delta SkyMiles rewards cards being particularly problematic.<p>And with payments there is very little margin for error because you are dealing with people&#x27;s money. Customers get very upset when you cannot charge their card, and it is not helpful to try to explain that the problem is downstream (for example the issuing bank is returning bogus error codes). The worst is the dreaded &quot;general decline&quot;; which is when an issuing bank declines a CC transaction but doesn&#x27;t tell you why.<p>The ACH network is even worse. There is no synchronous way to determine if an ACH transaction was actually successful. NSF errors (not sufficient funds) can come in 3 days after the initial transaction.

If the choice is given to the landlord to create &quot;no AirBnb&quot; buildings, you can bet your ass that just about <i>every single building</i> will be declared no-AirBnb.<p>Short term rentals present risk to landlord - damage of common property, excessive resource consumption (electric, hot water, gas, etc, that may not be paid directly by lease-holder). How high this risk is is a topic of hot debate, but it&#x27;s certainly a non-zero number.<p>Considering that the landlord sees nothing from the AirBnb&#x27;ing, and they have some legal ability to classify their building as &quot;no AirBnb&quot;, what sane landlord wouldn&#x27;t do it? This goes doubly if rents in non-AirBnb buildings are, as you suggested, higher.<p>This leads naturally to the thought that we can incentivize landlords to allow AirBnbs (read: kickbacks) - at which point AirBnb starts looking an awwwwful lot like traditional hotels, or worse, the slum-tels of old.<p>Side note: giant companies like AirBnb keep using the word &quot;sharing economy&quot;, which I find highly disingenuous.

142621,comment,141898,141898,0,0,scottgnet,,,"I've thought about how we could structure a business in such a way that no team became too large, and all functioned relatively independently across the country or the globe. I called it a ""federated"" business, which had a Constitution at its core that served the same purpose as the Constitution of the United States: to hold together these ""federated"" business tribes as one company. Each tribe did whatever work they wanted -- they had to find the work and do it, but could always request assistance from other tribes in the company who had expertise in areas they might need to complete a job. Any individual or tribe would be free to leave at any time without any restrictions. The only purpose of the ""federal"" part of the business would be to manage office-type things like legal, payroll etc. and possibly maintain a core tool kit that could be used by all of the others in their work. I figured out how to map it to the current corporate structure: each tribe would form as its own LLC; the core federated part would be an LLC as well, but would not own the others. There would be an agreement signed between the ""tribe"" LLCs and the federal LLC, but as I said, any of the tribal LLCs could ""secede"" at any time, as long as they fulfilled any open obligations to other tribes' customers. Also, all bylaws would restrict any tribe and the federal part of the organization from going public, even if they seceded. That would be the one restriction. I would only be interested in this kind of business if it were for the long-term, and not with the goal of flipping or cashing out. Not sure it would work as advertised, but it sure would be a cool experiment.<p>/s.",1206122055

You need to make a distinction between the views of a group and the wackos within that group. Especially when it comes to something as nebulous/fuzzy as the singularity. I totally agree that there are some ""singularitarians"" who do treat it as a religion, they are just so excited by the ideas that they irrationally glom on and make nonsensical claims, but this doesn't reflect the views of <i>all</i> of the members.

If you think about it, it works out for them since they can see how good you really are on the cheap (relatively speaking).<p>You'll probably work part time ~1-3 months until they really start to pressure you to go full time (assuming they like you). This is NOT fun.<p>At that point you need to decide to go full time or peace out. They are not sustainable, especially when you are part of a team and the rest of the team is working full time, and they're getting all frustrated that so and so is out today because he's part time.<p>I would just save up and then work full time on your idea(s).

142597,comment,141898,141898,0,0,zoltz,,,"Let's assume humans are indeed ""designed"" to work in small groups of only 10 people, then at the bottom level of the company tree groups should only consist of 10 people each. So far so good.<p>But why has a company of 1000 a three-level tree structure with 10 groups of 10 groups of 10 each rather than a two-level structure with 100 groups of 10 each? You assert the reason is the 100 bosses couldn't work together as that group size would be too big. But the bosses don't  form a ""workgroup"" in this sense anyway. They may meet occasionally but spend most of their time with their own groups. The reason for the additional tree level seems more that the supreme leader of the company wouldn't be able to oversee all 100 groups himself.<p>The distinction matters because for the purpose of being overseen, groups can be represented by their bosses without having to act as one person (as they might have to if their bosses formed a workgroup subject to size limitation due to humans' innate design), so the inverse relationship between freedom of the leaves and company size can't be deduced.",1206120115

My point is that even a casual glance at history disproves that. The German and Swiss states, for all their autonomy, couldn't stand up to Napoleon's hierarchical tyranny. In fact, it took a far more tyrannical society, Russia, to put Napoleon in his place. Hierarchy is sometimes necessary for survival, and is thus favored by evolution.<p>When we seek freedom, it is not because it is the evolutionarily superior state. It is because their is a conflict between individual advantage and collective advantage. When evaluating life decisions, you have to account for both.",1206119913

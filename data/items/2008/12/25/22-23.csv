Forcing them to lend money to people that they don't think can afford it sounds like deja vu, this time with government backing. I couldn't think of a more short-sighted policy. Talk about not learning from history, and in this case history is 2006.<p>Furthermore, he says:<p>>""Large ""confidence"" costs were always destined to flow from the extreme steps being taken, even if advisable, to prop up the economy. The federal government's alternating takeovers and bailouts of companies are inherently destabilizing and create massive uncertainty in investors and businesses.""<p>One of the reasons that economists who study the matter think the Great Depression took so long to end was that the sudden, drastic, and unpredictable actions of the New Deal created uncertainty and reduced business investment. It is certainly a valid point to keep in mind with a President promising a ""Green New Deal"" and a ""New New Deal"".<p>Obama hasn't got in office yet, but his stated ideology is certainly troubling to me.",1230245946
409820,story,,,4,2,niels_olson,"Anyone have success buying in the foreclosed home market?",,"My first homebuying experience was a bit odd (three generations of a friend's family, complete with general contractors and real estate agents, all sat around laptops one night while we fed them beer and pizza until they found the best houses for us).<p>This time . . . not so lucky. What sites to use? What are the key variables? I've mapped my new workplace and the best schools in the area. I know the general info about my area. I lived in the same city for six months about 8 years ago and I have friends in the area and I have a 10% down payment. The question is, today, what's the best way to buy the best house cheap?<p>Foreclosures obviously come to mind, but after trying Zillow and Foreclosures.com and foreclosure.com, this is clearly not a market I'm familiar with. This Boston Globe article provides minimal insight (http://www.boston.com/business/personalfinance/articles/2008/12/19/foreclosure_web_sites_offer_wide_range_of_listings/)<p>Has anyone had success with the foreclosure market? Could you be so kind as to share your advice?",1230245840

In fact, most large charities have employees who get paid, usually out of donations :). But you don't make your decision based on their management process, but based on the service they provide you; namely aiding some cause on your behalf.<p>You don't decide whether or not to buy a burger at McDonald's based on what percentage of your dollar goes to the CEO, but based on the quality of the service they may provide. Same with charities. If a charity can get away with paying exorbitant amounts to their CEO and still be the best value per dollar, people will donate, and it won't be wrong. Maybe the reason they do so well is that they were able to hire great high level management.<p>However, to convince people that you were going to spend their money one way and then actually spend it another is fraud. If you paid McDonald's for your burger, and they didn't give it to you, you would be within your rights to sue. At the very least you wouldn't go back. So it is with charities.<p>It is perfectly fine if you feel that a particular charity spends too much on management, and therefore decide not to donate your money to them. I realize that you may have been stating your personal opinion as to how you decide which charities you donate to, and that's fine. But to then claim in newspapers or other places that because they don't match your standards they are objectively evil and should be shut down/boycotted is a completely different thing. I think that is more what the article is about.",1230245791

409816,comment,409639,409639,0,0,patio11,,,"Not much new about this -- the ""make this strand of e. coli flouresce in the presence of certain sugars"" experiment was being done by (high school) AP bio classes ten years ago.  (I know, I did it.  Bloody things died on me, but my lab partner got it to work.)  Since you're not doing original research it takes all the biomedical engineering knowledge that growing a pack of sea monkeys takes -- can you follow a set of direction?  Good, have gene splicing.<p>The fearmongering about it is similarly blown all out of proportion -- people think that suddenly everything gets more lethal once humans get involved.  Oh noes if it isn't ""natural"" we're one drop away from World War Z.  Of course, crossbreeding never really triggered that, selective breeding never really triggered that, and viral infections never really triggered that -- but when its humans messing with genes <i>directly</i> why that is different, they say so right in the Hollywood movies.",1230245265
409815,comment,408786,409789,0,0,Tichy,,,"Hm, the waitress produces the food on the table. The food in the kitchen would be not much use, unless the kitchen was big enough to accomodate the customers so that they could eat out of the pots (and the pots would clean themselves afterwards). So while she doesn't create ""food"", she produces ""food on the table"".<p>I am not sure what you are really driving at: that too many people are in the service industry? But what if there is more demand for services than for products? Like there might be enough food being grown on the fields, but what good is it to me if nobody cooks it and brings it to my table?",1230245237
409814,comment,409562,409684,0,0,patio11,,,"I don't know -- I think a major portion of the experience is the <i>feeling</i> you get from the donation rather than the experience of seeing an objective indicator of your cause improving.  Who the heck cares if Charity CEO A owns a Leer and parties with Paris Hilton every weekend if his charity has triple the ROI on donations as compared to Charity CEO B.  (Not hard at all to imagine, incidentally -- private companies have that sort of difference in competence all the time.)",1230244940

409811,comment,409562,409562,0,0,quoderat,,,"The problem is that there are many qualified people in charity work who make barely-subsistence wages who would likely do an as-good or better job with far less pay.<p>So, for the most part, my guess is that $500,000+ salaries are a form of rent seeking, and are not justified in the so-called marketplace.<p>It'd be nice if someone could crash together the stats and see if this intuition bears out. You know, look at percentage of donations used to actually help their stated cause, and see if having a super-star CEO actually results in a more well-capitalized charity.<p>I doubt it, but I depend on evidence, not ideology.",1230244733

I mentioned in the referenced article that the guy has a higher calling in life.  He needs to feel some purpose, and I think he gets easily tired of contract work (much like I do).<p>Nothing will change.  Hard-working hackers will always get it right, and the slackers will always be weeded out of the system.  What we're experiencing now is a massive weed out of people who chose to sit on salaries instead of innovation.  Every year is the year of the hacker.  We start companies on the dime and innovate faster than anyone else with almost no experience.  We bring jobs and solutions at a pace that would make any Fortune 500 CEO's blood pressure rise to unsafe levels.  We just don't get much news coverage.

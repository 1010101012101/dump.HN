""""I'm calling it,"" Roy sighs, ""that's it."" And so, at 4:20 in the morning, some 70 miles shy of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Roy puts his turn signal on like some average commuter and once again stops, 2,160 miles short of his dream.""<<<<<p>I found it interesting that they decided to call it quits so soon; in Indiana, of all places, for rationalizing the lack of ability to catch up on average speed. (On this particular attempt)  Indiana isn't very far at all from the border of NY state.<p>The Northeast has extreme population density, slower posted speed limits, etc.  It seems to me that after completing that initial leg of the journey, they could easily catch up for lost time going across the more-or-less desolate midwest, even given their slower than desired avg MPH start.  <p>So they technically completed only 635 miles of the trip (2795-2160). . . a mere 22.7 percent of the total miles to be traveled.  I think if it were me, I'd wait until at least the halfway point before calculating averages and deciding whether or not to throw in the towel of defeat. <p>I definitely think that if there were anywhere to make up for lost time, it would definitely be across parts of the midwest.

69050,comment,68535,69000,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Just to jump in here, there's also a measure of agility that is required. Having any sort of formalized system based on criteria assumes by its nature that those criteria are always going to be true. Anybody who's been watching the tech world for more than five years knows that's not true.<p>
Not to mention the issues that come up once the system is changed. If the system is changed next year, and some companies that failed under the old system would pass under the new system, wouldn't that be a huge problem?<p>
You're taking people at the top of their game, with knowledge in the industry and technology, and having them make a fine-tuned judgment call.All this for a dynamically changing business environment. If the decision is of a well-considered and thoughtful nature at all, that's going to be very hard to systematize. The more you formalize it the more you lose your special sauce. There are qualitative scorecard-type solutions, but those by nature are personal opinions and would have to remain proprietary. ",1192632024

Then there is the large subset of enterprise world which is infrastructure and that will never look like Web 2.0.<p>As for Bill Gates, that is an old example. If you look at even the last 15 years, the most successful enterprise companies (VMWare, Siebel, SalesForce, ...) were founded by seasoned, college-educated founders.    ",1192631000

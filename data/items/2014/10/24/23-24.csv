I admittedly don&#x27;t know anything about the way Sage is build but you get the impression that they glued together many existing specialized solution to form one comprehensive solution. And while every piece is a mature solution and many people invested years of effort to build them, I also experienced over and over again how hard it is to integrate heterogeneous components. And that raises the obvious question whether it is more effective to integrate mature but heterogeneous solutions or to build a less mature but homogeneous solution at the added costs of reinventing the wheel.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_(mathematics_software)#Software_packages_contained_in_Sage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_(mathematics_software)#Sof...</a>",1414194556

To develop 1500HP means producing at least another 1500HP in waste heat, if not more like 3000-5000HP.</i><p>An electric drive system would alleviate a lot of that. For range, make it a series hybrid. It can recharge batteries en route, then operate in a &quot;cool/stealth&quot; mode, so that it can cool down and lie in wait under camouflage and in an enfilade position peeking over a ridge. For maximum stealth, we might want an electromagnetic accelerator instead of a cannon. Such a system would probably want to sacrifice physical protection from anything deadlier than high explosive artillery shells and machine guns for greater stealth.<p>While we are at it, why do we have to have massive armor and cannons? What if such vehicles could operate as &quot;drone carriers&quot; and launch swarms of drones which are designed as combined surveillance platforms and guided munitions? If you take something like an Abrams M1 tank and land a shaped charge on its main cannon and its tracks, then it just becomes a badly camouflaged machine gun nest. Once immobilized and de-fanged, its machine guns would then be easy to take out. Such drone-missiles can easily out-range the most sophisticated main battle tank gun.<p>EDIT: The lethality of weapons vs. armor has caused dramatic swings in the tactics of hand to hand weapons on the battlefield. It only makes sense that the increasing lethality of computerized weaponry would cause this to happen for armored vehicles. Knights in armor plate used to rule the field. Firearms made personal steel plate armor obsolete. It used to be that high velocity cannon and massive armor ruled the battlefield. Now it&#x27;s detection and situational awareness.",1414193908

Google will be aware of consumer behaviour changing in this space. I have noticed in my general non-techie personal circle that people are far more protective of personal data and changing their online behaviour compared to two years ago. I think this is Google&#x27;s current Achilles heel.<p>Tech: Google has so far got the best track record of security implementations which are open to anyone using their end-to-end platforms. They could seriously leverage this capability as a differentiator if it wasn&#x27;t for the perception that they &#x27;snoop&#x27; on its users.<p>Mission: In contrast to this Trend Larry Page has always been enthusiastic about a big vision of how consumers can benefit from sharing information to the right people, for example in the health space. At I/O 2013 this was a big topic for him: so many people&#x27;s health could be improved if they would be able to comfortably share their personal data with the right people. The true value of this has massive potential.<p>Indications for a Pivot: Eric Schmidt is currently touring Europe, stating that Google doesn&#x27;t &#x27;read&#x27; email and does not make its money from analyzing your personal data. \nIn the end Google&#x27;s best bet may be to try to transform itself into a personal, trusted data company.",1414192834

Roswell UFO crash is rumored to have been taken down by experimental military radar tests, not intentional military weapons.<p>6) Consider for a moment aliens are real and they are thousands of years more technologically advanced than us. What can we do about it? Nothing - we can do exactly nothing. Our &quot;powerful&quot; government leaders and best militaries would be exactly powerless to do anything. It would be full-on wide-spread global panic.<p>My personal theory is that given how vast the Universe is, it is entirely possible that some (millions?) planets were formed before Earth and at least many dozens/hundreds/thousands (?) evolved life to the point of human intelligence or greater, THOUSANDS of years before humans ever walked our Earth. This would translate to there being X number of alien civilizations out there far more advanced than humans technologically and more than likely biologically advanced (think brain power x 100+).<p>Consider how we&#x27;ve gone from horse and carriage to putting a man on the moon and creating space crafts that can travel 20,000 km/hour (in space) in a mere 300 years. Now imagine the capabilities (if you can) of what an alien species only 10,000 years more advanced than us might have. What about 100,000 years? 1 Million ?  Their technology would be like magic to us - completely unimaginable ... you know like travelling across entire galaxies in mere hours, teleporting through walls, having invisible craft, shooting paralyzing beams, erasing memories of (some) human abductees etc.<p>Why is it so hard to imagine and believe that other intelligent civilizations on other planets exist and that they might be thousands if not millions of years ahead of us?",1414192199
8506474,story,,,1,0,arthurcolle,"Ask HN: How are markets initially bootstrapped given initial lack of liquidity?",,"I&#x27;m quite curious about is the process of bootstrapping an exchange like btc-e.com or vircurex.com. I know a little about market microstructure and orderbook dynamics seems really interesting from the perspective of having an efficient, scalable data structure that can accomodate an arbitrary number of added buys/sells and realtime modifications in a highly concurrent setting. \nI think I understand the overall mechanics of an orderbook, but it seems like you would immediately (upon initial deploying or even during dev/testing) face the problem of &quot;OK I will make the first trade of this new exchange&quot; and submit a SELL order for 1 BTC for $351.5 (example figures), whereby nothing happens because you don&#x27;t have any liquidity whatsoever... That is the first thing I am wondering about. Does every exchange just implement their own orderbook? I read this post that explained a good way to design an orderbook (http://www.quantcup.org/home/howtohft_howtobuildafastlimitorderbook) and it was useful in understanding how they work, but in the real world context of building a working application, I&#x27;m experiencing a disconnect in how to realistically get users that would be willing to use it early on when it&#x27;s just running on testnet.\nOn a very superficial level this appears similar to the issue of any application that is dependent on a bidirectional relationship (Amazon has buyers and sellers, Airbnb has hosts and guests) but the unique aspect of an exchange web application is the fact that the orderbook concept doesn&#x27;t really equivalently exist in other marketplace structures so the process of bootstrapping must be significantly different than what you&#x27;d do for a dating website (example).\nI am looking for some input and just general thoughts about how the process of building out an exchange would entail with regard to making it a liquid market with a deep orderbook from as early on as possible. \nThank you in advance, I look forward to and would appreciate any feedback.",1414192188

Even smaller ones can make you give back a bit (such as NY ebola news or surprise BoJ news). Over time those commissions/fees add up.

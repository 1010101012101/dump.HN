However, with modern digital cameras, 30 seconds is about the longest exposure possible, due to electronic detector noise effectively snowing out the image. To achieve the longer exposures I do what many amateur astronomers do. I take multiple 30-second exposures, then stack them using imaging software, thus producing the longer exposure.<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa_jsc_photo/sets/72157629726792248/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa_jsc_photo/sets/72157629726...</a>",1339214394
4087135,comment,4070618,4087108,1,0,horsehead,,,"I would disagree, and say that proficiency in any given career is necessary, rather than just ""being smart and sociable."" And a valuable employee is a valuable employee. If they have ability, whether latent or developed, they have ability. if they have exceptional promise, bringing them on early will likely pay dividends later, even if there is a greater up-front cost. The problem is it's an investment, much like the stock market. And like in the stock market, you have investors with good and bad insight. It's all a game, in all honesty, though, and it usually comes down to saying the right things (which is why so many people bullshit their way through interviews and have no skills, and why many people with actual skills don't make it through -- they don't have the bullshit skills).<p>edit: 
> A very high number of people who aren't skilled at all try to get these jobs hoping its not really that big of a deal and they plan to fake their way through a job creating more work for the employees with these skills<p>This is absolutely true in every industry. EVERY industry.",1339214256

My screen name here comes from another site, where it was mandatory to use screen names (I'm actually more accustomed to online interaction with my real name and other people who use their real names), and then I carried it over to another site I heard about on the first site, and then over to here. I chose the screen name on the original site (the Art of Problem Solving site) because literally there a great many participants are young people below the age of majority, and it was useful there to distinguish who was an adult. At the second site where I used this screen name, I was again among users of mixed ages, with many minors participating, and it seemed helpful to keep this same screen name. On both of those online forums, most participants have correctly picked up the implication that ""token"" is part of my screen name to remove offense from the ""adult"" part of my screen name, by self-deprecation.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deprecation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deprecation</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenism</a><p>I kept the screen name here (although I could just as well have used my real name) simply by Occam's Razor, not desiring to choose a new screen name in case anyone recognized me from AoPS over here.<p><i>I automatically vote down everything I see by you.</i><p>I had no idea I have such a persistent fan club.

I cherish the opportunity to learn from you and from other participants, and look forward to seeing your further comments.<p>P.S. Previous HN polls about participant ages suggest the age range here is almost entirely above the age of majority but almost entirely below my age.

For one, they mention ""encrypted hashes"", which might mean encryption, might mean hashes, or might mean both; for two, they don't describe how they determined which users had weak passwords. If they were using some kind of reversible encryption scheme, it's possible that they ran that function against their database and determined common passwords that way.<p>I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, unlikely as it may be, because if they were in fact doing something as stupid as SHA1 or MD5 or ROT13, and they still opened their post with ""Keeping player information secure is very important to Riot"", then somebody needs to be strangled as an example to other mealy-mouths.<p>I also take issue with telling your users what kind of passwords to use. If you're storing passwords correctly, and if you're blocking brute force attempts, it <i>almost</i> doesn't matter what password your users are using. (Almost: somebody could still try ""password"" on an account and get lucky if it's one of the 10,000 accounts with that password.)",1339214133

It should be focused solely on the ""this should be allowed by Apple"" argument, because telling users that it's not <i>illegal</i> doesn't matter when it's Apple's store and Apple's rules, for better or for worse. They say that the encryption around AirPlay streams appears to primarily be there to prevent third parties from creating applications that work with AirPlayso it's easy to assume that Apple wouldn't approve of something they tried to prevent.<p>Is releasing something you know will get kicked out the best approach to take when you can't provide an approved solution? Maybe, if you think the resulting discussion and PR is your best chance at getting things changed... but then, again, you need to keep your message perfectly focused.

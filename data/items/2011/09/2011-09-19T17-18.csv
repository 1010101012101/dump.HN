3014517,story,,,8,11,discolemonade,"Why so many politically correct people on HN?",,"Not everybody, of course. But enough to discern a pattern. Programming requires the kind of intellectual rigor and purity that’s incompatible with political correctness. On a good number of the threads, you don’t see enough of the kind of reductionist thinking that one would apply to hacking, applied to just ideas in general. Two examples: every once in a while, the topic of how difficult it is to learn to program well will pop up. And the general consensus often seems to be that anybody can learn to hack well and that learning how to program well has little to do with how smart you are. It’s hard to see how anybody who knows how to program can deny that abstract thinking capacity is a serious factor in learning how to code; and that it isn’t distributed evenly. Second is the issue of why there are so few female hackers or women in technology overall. How many millions of dollars have been pumped into efforts to get girls interested in tech. The results are always dismal. The thinking, even on here, seems to be that women don’t have enough good role models. Hard to believe if you think about it for a second. So few people are willing to admit that the reason women generally don’t get into tech is because they’re not interested in it. I don’t know many females in my life who’d rather spend hours focusing on impersonal abstractions rather than people. It’s generally not a female inclination. This phenomenon plays itself out in college classrooms all over America. How many female nerds do you know? Would be great if more people were honest about what they really believed.",1316455085

3014481,comment,3010290,3012623,1,0,imjk,,,"I think you're correct and I still don't think you invalidate Gladwell's point. Remember Gladwell originally proposed his idea on what it takes to become a ""genius"" to dispel the conventional notion of what it takes to become the Bill Gates's, Wayne Gretzkys, and Mozarts of the world. He's challenging the notion that these geniuses achieved their success by way of some innate talent in their fields. Whereas, he applies the ten thousand hours theory to show that the idea of some innate genius is a myth, but rather requires much work to achieve that level of success (not that profound). I think it's hard to argue with this point.<p>Where you (and many other people including myself) find trouble in Gladwell's work is that it's too cursory and often overreaching. It's true that he's doesn't go into the specifics of various fields in defining the specific areas that each requires to achieve that genius level.  But such a study would be extremely exhausting, if not impossible. It's also not where Gladwell sees his role; he's a pop scientist, not an academic. His job isn't to take academic studies and dig deeper. Quite the opposite. As a pop scientist, he takes academic research proposed in academic fields such as psychology, sociology, and anthropology and he extrapolates these ideas into popular culture to cater to a much broader audience. Taken in this context, I think you'll have a much different experience reading his work.",1316454563

For physicians who dont type well, the touchscreen makes information-gathering a lot simpler than trying to use a keypad, says staff physician Dr. Carol Ann Smith, who also takes advantage of the speech-to-text feature in drchrono EHR to dictate notes.""<p>As someone who spent the last hour charting(takes me about 2 minutes a patient with templates) I think this part of the article glosses over the real difficulty of using a tablet for EHR--namely that when patients are sick you have to manually enter a lot of data that wouldn't be in your template.<p>For example:<p>Subjective Findings: Patient presented to clinic for a 4 day history of cough and 2 day history of vomiting. He has vomited 3 times and there is phlegm in the vomitus. He also complains of a rash on his forehead that has spread down to his trunk that is maculopapular and itchy. The patient denies any fever, chills, dizziness, or headache.<p>A template can't do that for me...and it's a pain to enter that on a tablet.

Combining these two services has generated the mass market appeal that Netflix has capitalized on.<p>We (my household) are about to embark on a study of all the content we've watched through Netflix in the last year. I'm going to compile a list of every movie we've watched to see which titles are available streaming, and which are available only on DVD.

They're easy to lend out.  They're easy to find (both in stores and when sitting on a shelf in your house).<p>For my part, I still prefer DVDs because I actually like owning the disc.  But more than that, I have a 25 Mbps FiOS connection and somehow at least once a week when I'm streaming something, Netflix dynamically changes the quality.  It's more annoying than skipping due to scratch discs and the quality comes out terribly.

There will still be people writing C++ in 20 years.  I'd feel a lot less confident saying that about Node.js.

I work at Rackspace and when we've had issues you'll see comments or posts from our leadership (CEO, Chairman, GMs of our businesses, etc.) -- and those come directly from the person, not from them giving approval to a comment put out by PR.<p>It is times like this when a company needs leadership and that isn't an executive team afraid to share their vision and apologize when needed directly to customers themselves.<p>Could they be ""using their time better""? I firmly believe, no they can't.  Having real interaction with customers on their terms keeps them grounded.  Many executive teams end up drinking Kool-aid(tm) by only taking customer meetings hand picked to show ""how good we're doing"" by their teams -- every business has at least one happy customer.",1316451878

3014301,comment,3013620,3013917,3,0,johnnygood,,,"There are two things here: business and technology.<p>AT&T and Verizon are both using ""700MHz"" spectrum.  However, Verizon is using the upper-700MHz band and AT&T is using the lower 700MHz band.  It is possible (clearly) to support multiple frequency bands, but it isn't free.  Plus, AT&T is shipping 700/AWS devices.  While Verizon has AWS spectrum, their current crop of devices are 700-only.  So, it would mean AT&T supporting three bands 700L, 700U, and AWS.<p>Beyond that, carriers generally don't do roaming where they have service already. AT&T already has data service everywhere Verizon has LTE.  It's slower data service, but it's still service. Voice works the same way. A company might have very low signal in an area, but as long as the phone can get any signal, it will prefer its home carrier.  If they had the same policy with LTE, it wouldn't help customers.  Heck, Sprint users are allowed to roam onto Verizon for data, but are restricted to 1xRTT (2G) when roaming on Verizon (save for legacy Alltel areas).  It might be that Verizon's data roaming rates are so high for newer technologies that it would be unreasonable to offer roaming like that.",1316451760

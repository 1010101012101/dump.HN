It&#x27;s hard for me to respond without sounding insulting or condescending, but you are wrong on pretty much every word you write.  Unfortunately, you are probably the victim of biased writing about Japan.<p>For just one example, go here: <a href=""http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/english/html/travel_and_visa/travel_and_visa_index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/english/html/travel_and_visa/t...</a><p>Scroll down to the section about getting a working visa.  Have a look at what is required to get such a visa and compare it to your own country. (Hint: you need a university degree and a job offer -- after that you&#x27;re pretty much golden).  In contrast I can&#x27;t even take my Japanese <i>wife</i> home to Canada without paying $1500 and waiting 12-18 months to get health insurance and working privileges.  I&#x27;ve lived in Canada, the US, the UK and Japan and Japan is <i>by far</i> the country with the laxest immigration policy.<p>If you were to research the topic, you would discover that the low fertility rate is mostly due to the fact that the average age of marriage is 29.7.  The average age of a first child is 30.3.  Women in Japan live with their parents until they get married for the most part.  Usually they work so they are both rich and free and not particularly interested in getting married (or having children).<p>Have a look at this graph of the average age of women having their first child in the UK: <a href=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/10/20/article-2051374-0E757A8F00000578-84_634x422.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/10/20/article-2051374-0E...</a> (source is the Daily Mail... sorry, but I&#x27;m sure you can find a similar graph from a reputable source if your are bothered to look harder than me).<p>The west is catching on to a good thing and following Japan&#x27;s lead.  Just like Japan, as women take <i>less</i> traditional roles in society the fertility rates drop.  It is practically the opposite of &quot;extremely traditional values leading to very low fertility&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read plenty of pieces in the BBC or the Japan Times talking about how backward it is here.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard many people talk about xenophobia in Japan because the immigrant population is very small.  But in reality, like all stereotypes it is a small seed of truth covered up by a mountain of BS.<p>It is true that the population is aging here.  What young people there are seem to be flooding to big cities too, leaving a pretty big gap in the agricultural industry.  There are definitely going to be problems.  I often wonder if Japan will keep its position in the G8 (currently 3rd largest economy by GDP).  I&#x27;m not sure that it matters all that much, though.<p>Japan will be fine even if it is not a world economic super power.  Life here is extremely good -- even for an immigrant like me.  I don&#x27;t think it will change that much.",1433080331

You also get the debt preference in case of acquihires and early exits.<p>Good point about the acquihires, which is a case I hadn&#x27;t thought of.  But for anyone building a real business I only see it as a disadvantage.<p>Consider three scenarios:<p>1> angels get equity (series &quot;pre-A&quot;).  Set a price.  Now the next round values the company at 30M pre -- they get a small chunk of a company worth a lot, and that has a good chance of being worth a lot more in future.<p>2> Angels don&#x27;t set a price: Now the next round values the company at 30M pre -- they get a 20% larger chunk of a company worth a lot, and that has a good chance of being worth a lot more in future.<p>3> Angels put a cap which has now become a de facto price, say 10M. Now the next round values the company possibly at 30M pre -- but especially due to the &quot;anchoring&quot; effect of having a number out there it&#x27;s maybe 20 pre.  They get perhaps more of a smaller company, and the founders get diluted more (since the new investor still wants their percentage -- the growth comes out of the founders&#x27; hide.<p>This creates a conflict of alignment between the note holders and the founders.<p>These caps are typically unheard of on bridges and other debt instruments companies take on later (except for dying companies) because the preferred shareholders know full well how destructive they are.  So why subject the founders to these terms.  Because they are naïve and you know you can get away with it?<p>> For institutional investors, all they now only make the discount return on the note, while for an angel, well all you get is to participate at the series A.<p>All kinds of entities get the same terms on the note.  Both get the discount.<p>> Bad for the company, great for investors.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s precisely how I see the cap.",1433080129

9634155,comment,9632604,9633990,0,0,mjfisher,,,"I don&#x27;t think so - it certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like security theatre to me. Minecraft never had to worry about COPPA; Notch never set out to create a game targeted explicitly at children (it&#x27;s just since found a huge market there) and player tend to host Minecraft servers themselves, which neatly side-steps a lot of the issues.<p>I work in an area of the industry that does regularly make multiplayer games and apps for kids. A number of clients have commissioned MMO style games through us, but their visions are usually optimistic and centred around letting kids play and explore freely. Without extensive guidance from us, they&#x27;d often want to allow things like free chat within a game world without getting explicit parental consent first - which is great for building a community of players and allowing them to interact, but a nightmare to police adequately. It requires a lot of moderation overhead, which comes with technology and staffing costs that might not be otherwise expected.<p>This isn&#x27;t just another &quot;think of the children!&quot; style blanket statement with no real thought behind it. There is a real threat here. Most users in an young online community are kids who interact constructively. There might be occasional bits of swearing or abuse, but that&#x27;s not really a problem. Kids enjoy breaking social taboos because it&#x27;s naughty and funny. I really don&#x27;t think that poses a danger in any way, although it can do damage to a brand if it becomes prevalent and public enough.<p>There are though a small number of adult sexual offenders that attempt to target and exploit children using these services. They do exist, and they are persistent and very difficult to defend against. I&#x27;ve worked closely with a number of companies that provide third party moderation tools that attempt to profile and flag such offenders through fairly sophisticated language profiling. It&#x27;s difficult; there are certain otherwise innocuous words that offenders use to avoid writing anything directly incriminating. I don&#x27;t worry too much about children shouting out &quot;Penis!&quot; in a chat room. I do worry about them divulging their home address, or agreeing to a meet somewhere, or (more commonly) being coerced into a webcam chat.<p>We don&#x27;t need studies to attempt to see where lack of thought in this area can lead; we have actual events. There&#x27;s a famous example in Habbo Hotel, where lack of adequate moderation led to a scandal the ended up with the owners turning off chat entirely (<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18424400"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18424400</a>). Had there been protection laws enforced in that example, Habbo might not have ended up in that situation and its young players might not have been sexually exploited (<a href=""http://www.brentwoodgazette.co.uk/Billericay-sports-coach-Matthew-Leonard-jailed/story-14269044-detail/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brentwoodgazette.co.uk/Billericay-sports-coach-Ma...</a>).<p>I&#x27;m sure the law will be (as usual) slow to react to change. But I&#x27;d rather it there than have no protection at all. It doesn&#x27;t take malice to expose children to danger - just careless product design. There needs to be some legal liability to provide pressure to stop that happening.",1433080068

I know exactly what I need to build immediately -- what code I&#x27;m writing this morning, what tests I&#x27;m currently trying to make pass, or however you want to look at it. I also have a very clear idea of what I need to build later this week. I have some idea of what I need to build by the end of the month. I have a tentative idea of what I&#x27;ll need to build in three months. On most projects, I probably have very little confidence in what I&#x27;ll be building a year from now.<p>When I&#x27;m designing and coding, the amount of weight I give to potential future needs is based on that sliding scale of confidence. If I&#x27;m writing two cases for something right now and expect to need the third and final possibility next week, I&#x27;ll probably just write them all immediately, so that whole area is wrapped up and I don&#x27;t have to shift back to look at this part of the code again in the immediate future. For something that I will probably need in a few weeks, it&#x27;s less likely that I&#x27;ll implement it fully right now, but I might well leave myself a convenient place to put it if and when the time comes if that doesn&#x27;t require much work. For me, the latter is sometimes a bit like deliberately leaving the final step of a routine task unfinished at the end of a working day so I can get going the next morning with a quick and easy win -- it&#x27;s as much about the positive mindset as any expectation that doing something immediately vs. very soon will make any practical difference to how well it gets done.<p>Obviously as I look further ahead, confidence in specific needs tends to drop quite sharply on most projects. For something tentative that is being discussed as a possible future requirement for later this year but with no clear spec yet, it&#x27;s unlikely that I would write any specific code for it at all at this stage. However, I might still take into account likely future access patterns for data in my system if I&#x27;m choosing between data structures that are equally suitable for the immediate requirements. I might take into account the all-but-certainty that we will need many variations of some new feature when planning the architecture for that part of the system and design in a degree of extra flexibility, even though we have no clear idea of exactly which variations they will be yet and I&#x27;m not actually writing any concrete implementations beyond the first one at this stage.<p><i>And, if your experience is that extrapolating requirements far off into the future has been helpful on average, then we have definitely worked on different kinds of projects.</i><p>That&#x27;s not really how I look at it. I&#x27;m not so much extrapolating (a.k.a. guessing) specific requirements far ahead. I&#x27;m just allowing for the possibility that I may have <i>some</i> useful knowledge about future needs without necessarily having all the details yet. If I do, I will take advantage of that to guide my decisions today to the extent that confidence justifies doing so. The amount of actual change in designs or code that results will vary with both the level of confidence I currently have in whatever potential requirements we are talking about and in the assessment of how much effort is required to allow for them now vs. how much effort will potentially be saved later if the expectation is accurate.",1433079317

Why does the 2/3 cross the L out in Brooklyn without a transfer when the stations are right on top of each other? They were run by competitors. Why do the F/A/C/G shun the other lines as they plow through downtown Brooklyn? Why do you need to walk from the 6 to the F at 63rd Street? Why can&#x27;t you transfer between the Hewes Street and Broadway (G) stations if they&#x27;re right on top of each other? Why can&#x27;t anyone figure out how to navigate Court Street? Why, for years, was there a transfer between the BDFM and downtown 6 at Bleeker St, but not the uptown 6? (That silly little bubble in the subway map.)<p>To this day there is <i>exactly one spot</i> where an IRT train shares a platform with a BMT train (Queensboro Plaza). And there are essentially two places where trains transfer between the old IND and BMT tracks (at the Manhattan Bridge, and Queens Plaza -- the third, under Central Park between the Q and the F, occasionally figures in maintenance-related detours).<p>The good news is that New York is lousy with subway stations, and if there&#x27;s a disruption on one line, there&#x27;s a very good chance you can still get where you&#x27;re going on another.

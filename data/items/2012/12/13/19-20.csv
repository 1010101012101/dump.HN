The business plan isn't too different if you've got a company with more staff that takes $100,000 a month to support except it's harder to cherry-pick a niche that's more profitable than average.<p>A company like AirBNB has to make a nonlinear change in people's behavior to succeed,  it has to cross some threshold,  which produces a certain kind of risk and poses a certain kind of reward.  Advertising,  in itself,  doesn't need to be disruptive to succeed.<p>For big brands you're facing the need for big investments to keep up your brand.  For instance,  ESPN spends a lot on IP rights,  photographers and other things,  and that is what makes ESPN a premium site.  Again,  you don't have this tiny investment that explodes,  but a slow and steady crawl that,  in their case,  is surely subsidized by the huge multichannel TV business.",1355428465

I'm sorry that I accidentally implied that you, specifically, were regurgitating Infowars points.<p>You ask, in effect, if the administration already had the ability under its war powers to detain people, why create a new bill that re-affirms that power? The answer is political. The conservative GOP wanted to re-affirm those war powers that benefited the CIA, and at the same time some (but not all) liberal elements of the Democratic party wanted to clarify and rein in those powers. There was a fight, and then a compromise bill, which, reading between the lines, attempts to punt the thorniest parts of the debate to the Supreme Court while creating an immediate statutory authority for CIA and DOD to continue doing what they're already doing.<p>Yes, this is a clusterfuck.<p>The problem in the US is that we were hit with one of the most damaging, best organized terrorist attacks by a non-state actor during the least competent administration of the past 50 years. Congress panicked and granted the Bush administration a wish list of military powers, and we're spending the ensuing decades gradually cleaning up after the resulting mess.<p>That's a problem. But it's not a sign that the US is gradually turning into a dystopian hellscape.<p>I don't care, except for two things. First, when people bring up the NDAA, they set off a ""someone's wrong on the Internet"" sensor that, as a nerd, I am unable to suppress. Second, as much as Internet psuedo-activists do not want to hear this, the ""NDAA"" issue is in fact a corner case in US policy. Indefinite detention of political dissidents in China is not a corner case. It is a daily fact of life, as it is elsewhere in the world.<p>You can make millions of dollars spinning conspiracy theories about the evils of the government and big corporations in America, and the reality is, nobody really cares.

I think it's more just a classic case of groupthink; people just adopt the opinion of the group for the social benefit, more or less subconsciously.<p>More important than simply <i>having</i> an unpopular opinion is the willingness to express it when asked, even if it's not going to result in praise or accolades from the group's (explicitly <i>or</i> implicity) chosen ""thought leaders"". Such a thing encourages independent analysis and challenges the authority of said ""thought leaders"", which is healthy in most contexts.<p>It's especially important to do this in tech; since many of us seem to lack basic social skills, the cost of expressing a thing at odds with the group's position are disproportionately severe, and combined with the technical perspective of most in the field, groupthink pervades our sector particularly deeply, and the consequences of opposing one's technical religious positions are particularly harsh.<p>While it's pretty obvious that Andreesen's opinions are informed by his personal perspective as a wealthy dude, I don't think we should allow that to unfairly bias our reception. We're obviously not going to volunteer to have the phone company charge us $500/mo, but it doesn't mean that he's wrong about the basic principle of metered data or the availability of supply.<p>While you see an ""artificially restricted supply"", Andreesen sees ""artificially curtailed demand"" (as far as supply<->demand applies to pricing) by heavy dependence on cheap offshored labor and the political impossibility of bringing that labor front and center (i.e., on-shoring it).

4917592,comment,4915944,4917407,2,0,willurd,,,"Thanks for the info about the AUMF. I'll definitely have to look into that further.<p><pre><code>  Notice that the 2001 AUMF, which was written in a panic,\n  authorizes arbitrary force with no mitigating effort\n  required not only against nations but against\n  ""organizations"" and ""persons"", and continues to authorize\n  those efforts so long as they might prevent future acts of\n  terrorism.\n\n  It is hard to get much worse than that. The NDAA doesn't\n  make it worse; in fact, by putting pen to paper and\n  outlining specific circumstances in which the US can use\n  its military to detain people, it ostensibly makes it\n  better (it is hard to imagine making the 2001 or 2003\n  AUMF better without repealing it and starting over,\n  though).\n</code></pre>\nYea, that's definitely horrendous. That being said, the entire purpose of Section 1021 of the NDAA 2012 is to affirm those governmental powers. There's even a section which I cited which specifically states that the NDAA doesn't limit the President's powers at all: ""(d) CONSTRUCTION.Nothing in this section is intended to limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force."" Which basically means ""everything we just said about limits and expansions means jack squat when it comes to the president; (s)he can do whatever"". So yea, the AUMF started this, and it was broad and allowed everything. The NDAA is still a problem because it continues it and doesn't actually limit anything when it comes to the President.<p><pre><code>  The Alex Jones take on the NDAA would be that it's a huge\n  executive overreach and a sign that the current\n  administration favors an overt authorization of Latin\n  American-style ""disappearings"" of suspected terrorists.\n  Apart from the 2001-2003 context those febrile rants\n  exclude, there is also the fact that the House and Senate\n  GOP wanted the 2012 NDAA to expand the powers available\n  to the executive to combat terrorism.\n</code></pre>\nI don't think I mentioned Alex Jones. Also ""huge executive overreach and a sign that the current administration"" and ""the House and Senate GOP wanted the 2012 NDAA to expand the powers available to the executive"". Both of those are right :) Both parties are responsible for this. This is a bi-partisan effort haha.<p><pre><code>  It is also possible to be disquieted by detention and due\n  process provisions in a war powers act while\n  simultaneously understanding the context in which a\n  reasonable person could assert them. For example,\n  without some provision for detaining US citizens abroad,\n  how would you lawfully handle any armed conflict with\n  the Taliban? There are more than 300MM Americans. Some\n  of them will win the lottery, and others will in fact\n  fly to Pakistan to train with militants, as has already\n  happened repeatedly. US military forces will eventually\n  encounter them in armed conflict. In every war, there\n  is always going to some due process concern regarding\n  the handling of possible US citizens taking up arms to\n  fight alongside our opponents.\n</code></pre>\nIf a US citizen is engaging in a firefight with US armed forces, then yes, there's your proof they are ""terrorists"". If you can a US citizen in the act of building a bomb, then yes, there's your proof. However, if through the grape vine you gain ""intelligence"" that a certain US citizen is a ""terrorist"", by constitutional law you must provide that citizen a fair trial by a jury of their peers (i.e. not a military trial). If overseas, bring them back to the US. The AUMF generally and NDAA more specifically do away with that requirement (which is, in my opinion, one of the most fundamental aspects of american freedom).<p><pre><code>  The Al Qaeda AUMF is ridiculously overbroad and needs to\n  be fixed. But the NDAA, a utility bill that happens every\n  year to fund the military, is not a re-ratification of\n  that act, nor does it create a civil liberties regime\n  in the US comparable to that of China.\n</code></pre>\nIf it's not a re-ratification, then why mention it? If the government doesn't need it, why put the language in there? I think it's important to keep in mind that few things are put into legal documentation without express purpose, especially at the level of government.",1355427023

4917530,comment,4914217,4915429,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Already there are 2 replies to my post that entirely miss my point, I'll try to restate it more clearly.<p>First off, note that any individual with a job is denying someone else that specific instance of that job. If the total piano tuning revenue in a city can only support, say, a multiple of 5 times a ""decent"" wage for a piano tuner then any one of the piano tuners in that town who has a job is keeping the 6th, 7th, 8th, etc. potential piano tuners out of a job. This is true all over the place. And this sort of truth becomes very painfully obvious when automation or technological advancement replaces the need for a worker in a specific job. It's easy to see a robot as replacing a worker. It's easy to see the rise of electric lighting putting candle makers out of business.<p>However, these are flawed and incomplete ways to look at economic and technological change. What actually happens when a robot does a job, or when a person does a job, or when technology makes an existing industry obsolete is that value is still being added to the economy. Jobs and wealth are not part of some fixed pie that everyone takes a slice out of and then robots can steal someone else's slice, that's not how it works. When someone does a job they add value to the whole and they take compensation. And the value they create is greater than the compensation they receive. Now, sometimes this isn't always the case, but in almost all cases it is, even the half-incompetent teenaged register operator at the local fast food place.<p>And this is true of robots as well, who can also be viewed as workers in a way. They increase the size of the pie much more than the amount of the pie (wages in the case of workers, maintenance and operating costs in the case of robots) they consume.<p>The incremental bulk economic impact is almost always positive for every worker with a job, even robots. This is why we shouldn't be concerned about foreigners ""stealing our jobs"" (or ""jerbs"" if you like), or about automation ""taking away"" jobs. The jobs that are available will change but the addition of positive value to the economy benefits everyone.<p>The trick is making sure the economy and individuals are agile enough to keep people working even as the job makeup of the economy changes.<p>However, change has always been a constant in the job market not just in the last half century but also throughout the industrial age, back to the medieval period, and even back to the stone age. We're just fooling ourselves if we think that the economy has been anything other than dynamic and ever changing, at any time in our past.<p>Again, the economy isn't based on a fixed pie of jobs or wealth that falls on us from the sky like manna, jobs and wealth are created by individuals. Not just entrepreneurs but ordinary workers create wealth and add value to the economy, the value of their labor.",1355426311

Once a site grows beyond the cheapy hosting plans, there was a huge gap in the mid range before something like VIP became a possibility.<p>I am interested to see how existing sites migrate over, it looks like only a group of approved themes are allowed. Presumably, those looking to migrate will have to recreate their existing UI experience on one of those pre-approved themes.<p>The theme issue actually smells like a decent business opportunity for savvy Wordpress theme designers.

(kind of like search in that way :-) When its done well it looks pretty straight forward, lay down a tile with your current location, populate it with things from a database that are 'near' that location. Choice of tiles and points of interest based on user preferences. How hard can it be right?<p>So first there is raw data collection. That is a pretty capital intensive process and its never really 'done' because the world changes a lot, so you need a data collection 'process', sort of like building a really complex software product that you can periodically 'tag' as a release and push out. The capital costs from either on the ground surveying, or aerial imagery. Its not acceptable to put a circle on the map and label it ""Tokyo"", there are streets and houses and buildings and parks. So the capital intensive part is taking aerial photographs, or satellite imagery, and post processing it into your tile layers. And that just gets you to one level of gross detail, there is so much more than that.<p>Because of the intensive capital investment folks who get map data understand they have a valuable bit of information. Its one of those things where it would cost big bucks to acquire it so you can sell it to others who want it.<p>Then there are points of interest, who are all the businesses in downtown? What are their hours? Are the streets one way? paved? gravel? private or public? Are there travel restrictions? All of this data can be gathered by on the ground vehicles but that takes time. (or a lot of money if you do it in parallel) and all that data has to be fused together into something which associates places with data. So think about how you would represent that vector from lat/long pair A to lat/long pair B was one way on weekdays and not on weekends?<p>One of the things that is really clear is that Google benefits <i>Hugely</i> from having their own in house search capability. That provides a treasure trove of points of interest. But did I mention search is hard? So any good mapping solution ideally has an in house search engine associated with it. Look at MapQuest, one of the originals, it was a search engine getting traction as a mapping application. Look at Microsoft, look at all the data they populate in their maps from Bing.<p>So there are at least three really really hard problems to solve before you can even worry about the user interface and how to interact with maps, data collection, data fusion, and web search. I'd be surprised if anyone felt they could just 'jump in' from a standing start and build a maps application in less than about 5 years these days.",1355426036

Granted, I'm a very socially liberal guy, but I think most evidence is pointing to the fact that information and sympathy is leading to more desirable social outcomes than repression and stigmatization.<p>For example, let's take something extremely controversial as pedophilia. The vast majority of society is of the understandable opinion that being a pedophile is immoral, often downright evil. People unfortunately don't realize how extremely important the different between simply being a pedophile (having sexual thoughts about children) and actually committing such acts are.<p>I think even something as pedophilia should be freely discussed and that pedophiles should be offered rational stigma-free ways to deal with their sexuality in ways that won't hurt children instead of being treated like scum by society. The way we deal with the issue today is hurting everyone involved - both the pedophiles and children.<p>A ton of people undoubtedly disagrees with me - and that's understandable from an emotion point of view. However - I've never seen any research or statistics actually indicating that punishing people for their problems (either directly through the law or through stigma) leads more significant positive societal outcomes than helping and sympathizing people with their problems does.",1355425908

People submitted all kinds of things, from hard copies of their entire application to photographs to fancy art portfolios.  The first day was heartbreaking as I felt like I was throwing away people's life's work, but when I asked my boss for advice, she said it was a conscious decision on the part of the admissions committee: they didn't want to unfairly disadvantage people who followed their instructions.<p>After a while, this system made sense.

In all that time, Navteq did very little, it seems, to improve routing, maps, or navigation. I was just using Apple Maps yesterday (I'm a very patient and open minded person that gives several unbiased opportunities) when I was told to go around this very short road segment.

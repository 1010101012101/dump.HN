6097726,comment,6093785,6095587,1,0,vidarh,,,"Deluxe Paint is not an extension/clone of MacPaint unlike most of the early paint applications of the era.<p>Dan Silva (the creator of Deluxe Paint) worked at Xerox before he got to EA. While there designed an in house paint application for the Xerox Star based on inspiration from SuperPaint  by Richard Shoup (at Xerox Parc). When Silva joined EA in 1983, he wrote a version of Doodle for MS DOS for in-house use at EA - this port was named Prism. Deluxe Paint started as an Amiga port of Prism.<p>(Source: The Future Was Here: The Commodore Amiga, Jimmy Maher, The MIT Ppess Platform Studies series)<p>So they have shared heritage, given that MacPaint too was largely inspired by work at Xerox, and it&#x27;s possible Silva made adjustments to Prism/DPaint after MacPaint was released since its release predated the commercial release of DPaint, but the application was already in use before MacPaint was released, though only in-house at EA.<p>If you look at the SuperPaint UI you can see its influence on some other painting applications too - Koala Painter on the C64 for example has a separate tools page that looks very close to SuperPaint.<p>But they are fundamentally different in other ways too - DPaint was designed specifically as a tool for artists first, and turned into a product afterwards. You see the difference in the various painting tools and brush support etc. that means you can actually &quot;paint&quot; with DPaint in a way you most certainly can&#x27;t with MacPaint. The workflow is very different - you can do great things with MacPaint (or MS Paint) too, but it is far more laborious because it&#x27;s hard to do much freehand drawing with it.<p>For me, when I moved from the C64, where I&#x27;d used Koala Painter - similar in capabilities to MacPaint - to the Amiga and started using Deluxe Paint, I first started drawing the same way I&#x27;d done on the C64: Laboriously placing pixel by pixel, with the occasional line draw or flood fill. Freehand was easier than on the C64 thanks to a mouse instead of a joystick, but the tools were not a good fit for that other than for large surfaces. But then I started experimenting with DPaints tools, like smear and blend, and my drawing style changed and got much more fluid and relaxed and it actually carried over to paper as well.",1374687864

Over time I just kinda picked stuff up here and there, mostly by reading code that others have done.  For a long time I was obsessed with coding straight up pixels, and writing putpixel routines.  Even lots of the html5/canvas stuff I do these days is just getting the context imagedata buffer and writing straight to that.  It was a totally organic process with zero structure.<p>So if I were going to start again from scratch, I would probably do the following:<p><pre><code>      - Choose one platform to target (HTML5/Canvas, WebGL, OpenGL, DirectX, etc)\n      - Pick up a book and learn the basics of that platform, and do the exercises\n      - Learn what you can about the APIs and start playing around.\n      - Fractals and cellular automata are always fun - you can find Mandlebrot and game of life examples in pretty much any language.\n      - Think of something in your head and try to make it happen!\n      - Add interaction\n      - Rinse and repeat</code></pre>",1374687747

This is the kind of initiative and creativity that will surely land you multiple job opportunities.<p>It reminds me of the steps which I took to transition into working on software professionally full time.<p>I came to programming relatively late in life when I was 26 and found out that my wife was expecting a baby.<p>The sudden change facing my wife and I made me take a hard look at my skill set to decide how quickly I could provide for us.<p>I decided that my interest in setting up wordpress installs as well as tinkering with Photoshop/Illustrator was the surest, safest, and quickest path to a successful career and decided then and there that within 6 months I would have a job as a junior web developer.<p>To help accelerate this I signed up at my local community college for courses related to getting a web design certificate. Ultimately I took 2 semesters (1 of which was a compressed summer semester) of classes including CS-1, Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, InDesign, HTML/CSS, PHP/MySQL.<p>Soon I began to get the feeling that school was moving too slowly. I had joined the W3C HTML5 Working Group and was also participating in the WHATWG and started to realize that I was learning much more by hacking on code in the evenings than I was in class.<p>During this time I started to create a portfolio showcasing new HTML5 APIs as they would become available across different browsers. Mostly I did this out of my own passion for web standards and wanting to understand the most cutting edge APIs as soon as they dropped. However this portfolio soon became incredibly valuable with regards to landing a job.<p>During the second semester I got the chance to interview for a local android dev shop (this is in Santa Cruz, CA). I got the job but didn&#x27;t find Java to be a good fit for my skills at the time and after a couple of months transitioned to another local dev shop.<p>This company was a rails shop building an app for Walmart&#x27;s internal network. I got the job based on my HTML5 knowledge and soon found myself learning rails.<p>Around this time I made the decision to quit going to school and to focus full time on my job. I was at this job for about a year until the company unfortunately went out of business.<p>Since I left that job I&#x27;ve spent a year and a half at trulia.com where I was on the mobile team building m.trulia.com, Trulia&#x27;s native windows 8 app, and the suite of webservices powering Trulia&#x27;s native iOS/Android/Windows apps. Currently I&#x27;m at cardfree.com where I&#x27;m working with ruby on rails.<p>The reason I posted this tale is to encourage you to continue what you&#x27;re doing! When I look back at my short but exciting career I notice that though I feel fortunate to have gotten a couple of semesters of training at a junior college it was mostly always the projects and initiatives which I undertook in my personal and spare time which ended up being the most valuable for me.<p>There is <i>so</i> much opportunity and demand in the consumer web and electronics space right now that showing this initiative and creating such a strong portfolio will surely land you multiple job offers if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.<p>Either way excellent work and I wish you the best of luck going forward!",1374687360

Terrorism is the trump card, the thing that compels/allows the state to take anything it needs. As one official put it recently &quot;We&#x27;re not trying to spy on you, we&#x27;re trying to find those among you who are trying to kill you&quot; And anything they do in order to prevent that from happening is fair game. It&#x27;s a perpetual state of war.<p>Having said that, this is kind of a good news/bad news situation. The good news? Looks like most of the secret back door rumors, at least when it comes to TLS, were wrong. The bad news? It doesn&#x27;t matter. If the government can try compel you to release the secret password for millions of users -- and then forbid you even to talk about it in the open -- then there truly is no limit to the monitoring and control they can exert. Whatever they get away with this year, there&#x27;ll be more to come next year. Fake out https websites, play MITM games with data providers -- if you&#x27;ve got the keys, the world is your oyster.<p>Back around the turn of the century, I worked on several government projects. Aside from the usual deadwood workers, there are folks that are really eager to push the technology and create as much automation and storage as possible. This is because they like to hack, just like the rest of us. I used to say, jokingly, that the only reason we didn&#x27;t live in a dystopian security state was that the government was too inept to actually create one.<p>Looks like the joke was on me. They&#x27;re pretty fast learners. Make the national transaction and storage system totally secure, then lean on the in-country tech community to give you the keys to all of it.

Some things are too hard to find in the haystack, but that&#x27;s more a problem of organization than content. (Always looking for suggestions on how to improve that!) As for the rest...<p>mrjob tries to make <i>all</i> parts of Hadoop and Amazon Elastic MapReduce jobs easy to write, run, and test. It can run without Hadoop at all, it can use your own Hadoop cluster, or it will automatically handle all the pain of shipping a job to Amazon. mrjob gives you a single API to use across all those platforms and a simple way to switch between them via the command line. It helps you manage file dependencies and greps the myriad logs for errors.<p>Dumbo (and AFAICT Pydoop) handle the Python-Hadoop bridge, but don&#x27;t do all that file management and config mishmash. They also don&#x27;t provide a &quot;Hadoop simulator&quot; for your automated tests. If you want to use one of those tools, you need a Hadoop cluster to run your code, and they won&#x27;t help you move dependencies and input files around.<p>The flip side to that is that mrjob doesn&#x27;t give you the same level of access to Hadoop APIs that Dumbo and Pydoop do.

But have you used it recently (meaning in the last several years) to write something?  Because it&#x27;s almost literally impossible to write something that looks modern and acts modern.<p>WebObject was <i>designed to hide web development as much as possible from the developer</i>.  I.e., to make writing desktop applications and web applications as similar as possible.  You&#x27;d make a view in HTML, a controller in Objective-C (or later Java), draw connections between them just as if you were making something in Interface Builder, etc.  Basically, HTML just became another OpenStep view you could target.<p>The downside of hiding the web part of web development as much as possible is you get a technology that is <i>very</i> far removed from modern practice.  To achieve the view/controller design pattern above, WebObjects effectively effectively uses a continuation-like pattern to hide the whole HTTP request/response loop.  That&#x27;s why WebObjects URLs are disgusting beasts: they tell WebObjects what state corresponds to what you&#x27;re doing.  ASP.NET WebForms does this same thing, by the way, although it slaps its data (called ViewState) into invisible form elements on the client-side, whereas WebObjects stores its state server-side.  Former inflates the page by 30k in even simple situations, latter makes the server need tons of RAM, but they both get you to the same place, and about equally well.<p>The problem is <i>that&#x27;s not how you write web apps these days</i>.  If you&#x27;re doing a simple-as-tea CRUD app, then sure, whatever, but you could also just publish your FileMaker or Access database to the web and be done with it in that case.  And for everything else, WebObjects, unlike even ASP.NET WebForms, makes it virtually impossible to have clean, trivially usable REST endpoints, which means you can kick your responsive client-heavy web app ideas to the curb.  Yes, you <i>can</i> work around it, and ProjectWonder provides some tolerable solutions, but you&#x27;re <i>really</i> fighting the framework the whole way.  Why bother?<p>I&#x27;m also highly dubious that having Objective-C on the server is really a good thing.  All those pointer errors you make in your iOS app that generally just result in a crash suddenly result in your server being rooted.  Memory fragmentation becomes an insanely huge deal, since Objective-C&#x27;s GC is primitive, and so on and so forth.<p>EOF was great, and would probably still be great.

LLVM happens to now use a greedy allocator that still tries to prioritize time over allocation optimality.<p>2. This is just a bad compiler then.  Good static profiling is actually quite good, and quite accurate, in most cases.  This includes value and other forms of profiling, rather than just simple static edge estimation based on heuristics.  Usually, the thing that gets hurt is not spill placement, but bad inlining decisions.<p>For diamond shaped switch statement interpreter loops with simple bodies, the real issue is that most greedy/linear allocators are not great at live range splitting.\nCompilers like LLVM (and to some degree, GCC), move all the variable allocations up to the beginning of the function to make life easy by removing scopes (otherwise you have really really crazy edge cases performing hoisting/sinking optimizations), and then for those that don&#x27;t get mem2reg&#x27;d, can&#x27;t prove they aren&#x27;t live all at the same time during the switch due to the loop.<p>Then they make bad choices about which of these variables should stay in registers because their value profiling infrastructures are non-existent.<p>Proper region analysis, allocation regions, and better optimistic live range splitting would go a long way towards fixing this, but it&#x27;s not worth it.  There is little to no sense in optimizing LLVM for the very uncommon case of interpreter loops (particularly when one of the goals of LLVM is to ... replace interpreters).<p>So the basic answer is: It&#x27;s not really a problem anyone cares to solve, not &quot;it&#x27;s a really hard problem to solve&quot;.",1374686021
6097438,comment,6090549,6096856,3,0,pron,,,"Your effort is very much appreciated. There, I upvoted both well thought-out answers.<p>I would never say that Scala&#x27;s designers are stupid. Far from it. The Scala compiler is a work of brilliance. And, obviously, every feature, as you so meticulously tried to present, has a purpose; tries to solve a problem. But your explanations, I feel, only prove my point. Many of your explanations are along the lines of <i>because sometimes you need that</i> (&quot;Some algorithms work best&quot;, &quot;a good tool to solve some problems&quot;, &quot;for some things it make sense&quot;...). While absolutely true, and every practical language, be it a programming language or a spoken language, needs versatility and irregular forms, it seems like Scala tries to take on each one at a time rather than spending most of the intellectual effort on defining the common case.<p>For example -- and this is an important philosophical point of disagreement -- you say of macros: &quot;... instead of having to resort to such terrible things as annotation processors, bytecode rewriting and Java agents.&quot; This, imho, the WRONG answer. Those problem areas that in Java are addressed by what you call &quot;terrible&quot; means, are highly irregular; highly uncommon. They <i>should</i> be addressed by &quot;terrible&quot; means if your goal is a simple language. Yet Scala seems to want to address every problem with a language feature, and in this case it&#x27;s a huge one.<p>On the other hand, when I look at Erlang and Clojure (or Ruby, though I&#x27;m less familiar with it), I see languages that were designed by people who sat down and thought long and hard about which are the top one, two or three most burning problems of software development, and then tackled those and only those. Everything else would be solved possibly &quot;terribly&quot; (though it would be solved). Rich Hickey thought long and hard and came to the conclusion that while OOP might be the right solution sometimes, in the end it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth, and people should not generally use it to write most programs. He may be wrong, and he may be right, <i>but he made a decision</i>. He thinks (I guess) that if your particular problem absolutely requires OOP, then you&#x27;re better off using a different language, one that&#x27;s been lovingly crafted for that purpose.<p>This is extremely important. A coherent language says, &quot;for my problem domain <i>these</i> are the tools you <i>should</i> use&quot;. A general-purpose coherent language adds &quot;... and most problems fall in this problem domain&quot;. For whatever is left, use other, better suited languages. Scala never says this. For every problem, big and small, it tries to find a solution <i>in Scala</i>. I mean, it&#x27;s running on the JVM for god&#x27;s sake, and interoperability on the JVM is particularly easy. Why not come out and say, &quot;DSLs are great; we absolutely love them; if you want to use them, write them in, say, Groovy&quot;?<p>I did not intend to ask <i>why would you ever need this feature or that?</i> What I asked was, <i>why must they all be in the same language?</i> If you had said, &quot;look, Scala just tried to do this, but because of sheer genius it just happens to do that, too&quot;, that would have been a good answer. But you didn&#x27;t. Each feature is there to solve a <i>different</i> problem. That&#x27;s why Scala lacks coherence.<p>A non-coherent language says, &quot;here are the tools you <i>can</i> use&quot;. It says, &quot;in your programming endeavors you might some day encounter this byzantine problem, and guess what? We got a tool just for that!&quot; It lays out a huge set of tools, all usable at some point or another, all serving a purpose, but doesn&#x27;t say &quot;I think you should rarely use this tool or that, so I&#x27;m leaving them out of the toolbox. When you need them, buy them separately&quot; (Worst of all, it gives you a bulldozer when all you need is a hammer. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s unwieldy)<p>These are two competing philosophies, but for modern software development, the latter is the wrong choice and the former is the right one. Software systems are getting bigger and more complicated as it is, while programmers aren&#x27;t getting smarter. Some challenges are much more important than others. Scala chooses to be Jack of all trades and master of none[1] in the very discipline that needs the opposite approach.<p>[1] What is the one or two things Scala is better at than any other language? For Clojure it&#x27;s managing state; for Erlang it&#x27;s fault tolerance. Both are at the very top in some other aspects as well. But what does Scala do better than anyone else? (and is that thing important? You might say it&#x27;s best at marrying OOP and FP -- though even if that&#x27;s the case I&#x27;d say being best doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re good enough -- but I don&#x27;t think that anyone would say that combining these two paradigms is what the software industry needs most. Or, you might say, typed OOP. But typed OOP is, again, a compiler feature, not a solution to a burning problem)",1374686019

The New York Times was cited as having a bad website. However, on occasion, when they put their mind to it, they produce a truly beautiful page with some fantastic visualization or something. But it&#x27;s a one-off; you can&#x27;t produce a beautiful page for every story, so you get the lowest-common-denominator page for most stories.<p>A literal paper magazine is a concrete artifact, and a set of designers can be tasked with making each page perfect. A web page on these sites is dynamic and may literally not serve the same page twice. If, as a designer, you don&#x27;t internalize the idea that these are two <i>extraordinarily</i> different domains, despite the superficial visual similarities of the final product, then you&#x27;re going to have a hard time accurately diagnosing the core problem. And I do believe many designers make this error on one level or another, when I see these complaints.<p>In Matthew Butterick&#x27;s defense, I do think he did implicitly make one very concrete suggestion for how those sites can improve, though, at least in terms of design: Get rid of the ads. It&#x27;s hard, probably to the point of impossible, to create a coherent design for a website when you are selling to the highest bidder the right to put a bright yellow and orange banner with a poorly-photographed item described in a random non-anti-aliased font unaligned with anything else on your page in the viewer&#x27;s highest-priority visual space, and a different such thing for <i>each page load</i>.

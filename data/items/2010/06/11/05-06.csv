I was expecting something a bit stuffy, considering their market and somewhat conservative approach to innovation, but the people in the hallways and lunch room seemed genuinely relaxed and happy. It especially struck me after visiting Facebook a few hours earlier and finding it somewhat grim. All very subjective of course, but it makes me think this is a bit of real fun, not a horrific corporate attempt at 'flair'.",1276235870

1422959,comment,1421952,1421952,0,0,callahad,,,"Ack! The author doesn't quite understand how this is implemented, nor how OkCupid handles matching people. If she did, I imagine she would have found the practice itself significantly less objectionable, though her points about the e-mail's phrasing stand.<p>(Full disclosure: I have an OKC profile, and on My 28th, I received the e-mail mentioned in the article.)<p>Members on OkCupid answer questions about lifestyles, dating, sex, etc. (e.g., ""Do you think it is appropriate for parents to choose their children's religion or a lack of religion for them?"") and then state how their ideal match would respond, as well as how important it is that a partner have similar views.<p>Your set of responses is compared to every other profile's set of responses, and the intersection between each pair is used to calculate a ""match percentage,"" which is a pretty good predictor of how folks will get on, or at least have compatible views. [0,1]<p>Almost any displayed link to another profile is accompanied by your match percentage with that individual. It's a major component of the site.<p>Now, when searching for people to message, most folks set up basic filters -- gender, orientation, age, kids, distance, etc. You have to order the result set somehow, and that's often either just the match percentage, or you can elect to sort by ""Match & Distance,"" ""Match & Last Online,"" etc.<p>As far as I know, searching is the primary means through which people find each other on the site, and this change will not impact that <i>at all.</i><p>There are a few places where OkCupid will show you somewhat random collections of profiles: On the homepage when you log in, in the sidebar on every page, and in two features: Quickmatch and Quiver.<p>Quickmatch is just a procession of profiles that you're asked to rate from one to five stars. If two people rate each other highly (or poorly), the site notifies them. Your ""quiver"" holds a rotating set of three profiles that their algorithms think are particularly good matches which you can choose to message or explicitly ignore.<p>In all but one of these cases, the candidate profiles are displayed with little or no additional information beyond a picture. On Quickmatch, the user's entire profile is displayed, but you must rate them before their account name is revealed and you're able to communicate with them.<p>The email indicates that OkCupid is using click-through data from these sources ferret out which profiles are the most appealing to its users. The <i>only</i> change that results from being one of those profiles is that when OkCupid shows you a random profile, it is more likely to pick from the set of more appealing profiles.<p>That's it.<p>If your profile is not within the upper half of all profiles, then you'll still get the same distribution of recommendations as before. And your profile will still show up in OkCupid's recommendations to more appealing users, albeit slightly less often.<p>But again, that's only for places where OkCupid itself recommends profiles -- on the front page, in the sidebar, on Quickmatch, and in Quivers. Search ranking remains absolutely unchanged.<p>Contrary to the author's assertion that ""the dreaded bottom 50% presumably do not have access to potential matches in the top 50%,"" the bottom 50% still has exactly the same access to the top 50% as before. They're just less likely to be <i>randomly suggested</i> to the top 50%.<p>I'd also challenge the assertion that ""the policy reinforces the notion that hot people deserve love and happiness and ""ugly"" people should just get used to being alone."" Rather, I think this may be designed to reward users who take the time to craft engaging profiles by showing them other profiles that have been vetted by the community.<p>The policy assuredly does <i>not</i> ""[make] dating decisions on the users' behalf without considering personal preferences"" since match percentages and search rankings are completely unaltered.<p>While the policy is indeed ""kept secret,"" and the language is offensive, I find it hard to accept that the policy is segregational or that it has a significant impact on the site's operations. I'm not even sure it's ""attractiveness-norm-reinforcing,"" since they're tracking click-through rates, which is not <i>necessarily</i> attractiveness.<p>Links about match percentages:<p>[0]: <a href=""http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/2009/09/29/how-races-and-religions-match-in-online-dating/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/2009/09/29/how-races-and-r...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.okcupid.com/faaaq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.okcupid.com/faaaq</a>",1276235489

1422932,comment,1421398,1421637,0,0,strlen,,,"Ugh, in C under UNIX this could mean two things:<p>* If some moron created a ""write()"" macro, it means expand \nthat macro (preferably it should also mean email the director of HR to suggest the author of the macro consider having the company pay for their MBA, to make sure they aren't allowed to touch code again)<p>* Otherwise, if a header has a definition for write use that. Otherwise, emit instructions to call put ""fd, buf, size"" on the stack and call write.<p>In C++ it could mean:<p>* There's a class ""write"" which has a constructor that takes three arguments<p>* There's a function in the global namespace called ""write"" that takes three arguments<p>* There's a macro called write<p>* There's method called write in the local class. That method could be invoked virtually or non-virtually. It could be inherited from a parent class.<p>* write could be an instance of an class that has ""operator ()"" defined<p>I probably left out some more. In fact, there's likely a firm somewhere that thinks ""what could write(a, b, c) mean in C++"" is a <i>wonderful</i> interview question (perhaps they could ask it to all those losers who don't know what ""explicit"" keyword does but still have the gall to think they're competent enough to work for them!)<p>In a UNIX system, with right headers included, what write does is specified by the POSIX API. POSIX is one of the best defined and cleanest APIs. It has existed before the world of IDEs and plug-and-play libraries. I can write non-blocking C network code for a UNIX OS with vi, from muscle memory after reading through man pages and working through Richard Stevens books.<p>Writing Java NIO code requires: an IDE to prevent RSI, traversing Javadocs to understand the non-intuitive APIs and searching mailing lists through Google to e.g., find out that Java NIO selector doesn't let me use edge triggered epoll because it would involve ""tight coupling"" (read: it might be difficult for somebody writing code on an AS/400 to use it).<p>JDK7 NIO2 potentially changes this (I can implement internals of a selector myself). I'm also sure I'll be able to target JDK7 with a Perl6 compiler... that I'll use to implement the firmware for my flying car, in which I'll travel pick up Hans Reiser when he's paroled from prison.<p>Note: in this case, it has nothing to do with the language. java.util.concurrent API is very well defined because it was written by great programmers (Doug Lea and Joshua Bloich) who are apt at API design. Unfortunately, Java doesn't ""force you"" to create a clean API like C does: there are no design patterns available, no IDEs, no built-in tools for literate programming in C; you either build a clean API, or no one will use it. While I'm in no way of Joshua Bloch's caliber, I can relate to him when he says that he stayed with imperative C until finding Java.<p>While Java doesn't force you to build a clean API, C++ almost makes it impossible to build a clean API: witness boost::spirit (""generic programming"", C++'s idiom for extending the language), compare with lex/yacc (external DSLs) and parser combinators (internal DSLs) in Haskell or Scala.<p>I want to like C++. I have programmed it for a living before and will almost certainly do so again: there's a certain combination that requires low-level code with no memory management <i>and</i> Object Orientation; my chosen specialty (distributed systems) often requires that combination (fortunately, not always: Erlang and JVM languages have been used to build some incredibly impressive systems).<p>Perhaps Go and D could come along and step up to that challenge, but I am skeptical: Modula-3, despite influencing other languages hasn't been able to step up to that plate. I feel C++ 0x, Intel collections for C++ and some parts of boost, STL and tr1 e.g., tr1::unordered_map, boost::scoped_ptr are very cool and useful. Boost Graph library is simply awesome and has no equivalent.<p>It seems, though, as if C++ was built by warring hordes: one horde that wanted generic programming and thought OO was pointless, another horde that wanted OO but thought generic programming was pointless and yet another that hated both. Neither won nor lost, each side said ""mission accomplished"" and developers were treated as ""collateral damage"". I could care less about which one of those to use: I am productive doing OO programming in Perl, Python, Scala and Java. I am also productive doing generic programming with CLOS in Common Lisp or with type classes (or their equivalents) in statically typed languages. Likewise, I am perfectly productive writing imperative code in C. I just want clean, easy to program to APIs with understandable error messages (either at run time or compile time, I am not picky about dynamic vs. static typing -- they're tools, means to an end) and C++ doesn't allow for that.",1276234936

Sure, the Russian winters harmed the German war machine greatly, but it's not as though that alone was the sole determiner of the outcome of the war. Even had the winters been milder the Russian forces would still have taken a heavy toll on the Germans and were nearly guaranteed to win that conflict by benefit of logistics alone.<p>Moreover, even had Russia fallen to Germany the American/UK military might by 1945 was far too great even for a Germany backed by the natural resources of Russia to withstand. By mid-1945 the allies had put together a machine in the Pacific theater in the form of bombers, submarines, and combined forces capable of razing cities, ravaging shipping, and conquering territory at an incredible rate. It would have been perfectly possible to direct some or all of that apparatus at an unbowed Nazi regime in mid to late 1945 through 1946 and visit utter devastation on Germany until it was incapable of fighting any war.

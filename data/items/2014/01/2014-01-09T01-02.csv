I don&#x27;t buy that this scene is any more racist than the rest of the US, and probably would argue that it is less so. But in terms of class bias, I think considerably greater. And the low incidence of black and latino folks can be attributed significantly to their statistically-lower class distribution.<p>As an anecdotal data point, I haven&#x27;t met a lot of white people from lower-class backgrounds who are players in the Bay Area technology scene. Actually haven&#x27;t met a lot of technology workers that are.<p>This is in contrast to the environment when I worked in finance in NYC and London.

Your startup isn&#x27;t &quot;diverse&quot; because you have 30% Chinese engineers. On the other hand, their success isn&#x27;t dismissed as the fruits of unfair privilege like white people (this accusation comes mostly from other white people). Part of the reason that writers ignore Asians is that they upset social justice narratives.<p>On the ground, there are few social barriers between whites and Asians. The exception is that I seldom saw an Asian man dating a white woman, as a commenter mentions below.<p>In the tech blogs, the large contributions of Asian people and culture to the Valley are just ignored.

On the other hand, when you have 10 tables involved in a 200 line query, debugging and maintaining the query is directly proportional to how well you can structure it.  Breaking the query down into functional, related pieces which can be reviewed and managed separately is the key to maintaining large queries.<p>The way I describe it is this:  In C or Perl, the complexity of debugging is linearly proportional to the length of the function. State accumulates during the function and consequently you have to read each line in context with those which came before and after.<p>With well-structured SQL, OTOH, you have something different.  You have a set of sub-functions which are each somewhat independent and state does not (usually, outside of specified window functions) accumulate.  Because it is declarative, a well structured query can be debugged not as a linked list of statements but as a tree.  This is far more efficient.  Personally I find a well-structured 200 line SQL query to be far more maintainable than a 50 line Perl function.  And if it is really well structured, you could probably push this further out.",1389230627

I think this problem is worth talking about and a solution should be pursued. I can&#x27;t help but think a lot of this could be eased by having better public-transportation in the bay-area for everyone, maybe tech companies should all get together and help fund & extend BART faster into areas that may help techies not feel like they have to live in SF.

The biggest takeaway I had is that an editor built on the DOM is a _very_ natural experience to work with. I come from a heavily emacs background and was always fond of its extensibility, but I found it fairly imposing to try and create or update nontrivial UI functionality. The usage of HTML and CSS greatly streamlines that process and makes it feel much more accessible.<p>Perhaps more importantly, not trying to restrict plugins to using a particular API has opened LT to integration with the tons of projects already built for the web -- from terminal emulators to emmet.io, integration is very nearly as simple as including the project&#x27;s source and embedding it&#x27;s root element into a tab.

So it&#x27;s not that memories from before age 3 never existed, it&#x27;s that they are subsequently forgotten.<p>This is obviously tremendously overblown.

We have plenty of people, here and outside, who can attest to preserving early memories.  Attacking them on the grounds that those memories could be reconstructions instead of strengthened &quot;true&quot; memories doesn&#x27;t make any sense -- all memories are reconstructions; there is no possible way to distinguish between a &quot;true memory&quot; and a &quot;reconstructed memory&quot; <i>at any age</i>.<p>All that said, the coolest experiment I know of in this area concerned visiting children still in the process of language acquisition with a &quot;marvelous machine&quot; designed to be highly entertaining and memorable.  The experiment showed that though the children remembered the machine a (couple?) years later, when asked about their memories of it, they would describe it using only words they knew at the time of the visit.",1389230048

Consider this:<p>CREATE FUNCTION stable_random() returns double language sql as\n$$ select random() $$ stable;<p>Now what I have done is wrapped a volatile function in a stable function.  Now the planner thinks it is deterministic and will fold it into the plan in a different way.  I could further mark it as immutable and allow the planner to run it <i>once</i> per query even if it occurs multiple times.  Now:  select my_random() will be treated as fully deterministic, so select my_random() a from my_table will return a list of the same singular random number (all values of a will be the same).<p>So how is the planner to know this?  Obviously we could just let the planner decide based on function markers but then you&#x27;d run into the case where a stable function above would produce different results, while a volatile or an immutable one would produce the same result.  That seems to make very little sense to me.....",1389229896

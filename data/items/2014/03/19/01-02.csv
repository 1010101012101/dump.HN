The first time about 14-15 years ago when the JVM was pretty doggish. I <i>think</i> it was Java 1.4 or 1.5. I don&#x27;t think Eclipse was even out then, and the first version I remember seeing was so dog slow at the time compared to Visual C++ that I remember just writing off Java entirely.<p>To my surprise it stuck around in Enterprise spaces and I ended up running a team that ported a pretty large-ish Perl project (about 20k lines of Perl) into a piece of Java middleware. I didn&#x27;t do any of the coding, but I knew the Perl bits inside and out so I knew what kind of testing and performance to expect and getting the Java port <i>up to</i> 1/3rd to 1/2 the performance of the original Perl was a pretty big challenge at the time. This was about...8 year ago. But to the credit of the team and I guess the tooling, they were able to get the port done remarkably quick.<p>So I&#x27;ve been pretty surprised to see that Java code <i>can</i> get fast, really fast. I&#x27;ve also managed to bang out some pretty slow code if I wasn&#x27;t paying attention. For my latest touch into it, I ended up spending a week just benchmarking various collections to see how they actually worked under the kind of real-world uses I&#x27;d be putting them through (vs. what their big-O sheets claimed) and came away with a set of practices for me to get going with.<p>I&#x27;ve also had to come to terms with benching code a bunch of times to give the JIT compiler or whatever runs under the hood in the JVM some time to optimize, the first few runs are invariably much slower than run 1000.",1395192921

Indeed, the level of rhetoric in our burgeoning class warfare is escalating rapidly; &quot;technocrats&quot; is my new favorite label.<p>But I question the TNCs strategy of approaching this long-term. It appears the strategy was simply to try and go the popular-opinion route. Of course the market has spoken, and it prefers Uber & Lyft by a huge margin over the traditional taxi market. However, in dealing with regulatory matters, political dealings are a necessary cost of doing business.<p>Instead, the TNCs did a few things wrong: 1) they jumped into the process a bit too late, 2) they took an antagonistic, condescending tone with the powers-that-be, and 2) they under-estimated the power of old-fashioned lobbying by the taxi industry.<p>Principles of market openness, disgust with the political climate, etc. don&#x27;t really matter in light of moving ahead. Now, the Seattle market is likely stalled for a lengthy amount of time. And, future markets know they&#x27;ll be able to extract a pound of flesh as the TNCs look to expand.<p>I hate the outcome and think the City Council deserves to be revoked, but the TNCs needed to do a much better job in handling this situation.",1395192886

In a proportional payment system there would be an even larger perverse incentive to get hit by moneyed people if the fine was in anyway punitive.<p>&quot;But it costs society to incarcerate and is a net negative from the point after the accident on&quot;, Yes but we decided that prisoners shouldn&#x27;t incur debt for being imprisoned for some very good reasons.<p>What of the victims? What benefits the victims more than giving them money after the fact is reducing the risk of it happening in the first place. A payment system has either a more harsh proportional punishment than the current system to decrease this happening further, or reckless driving will increase because it is more tenable for the drivers (or people are irrational when assessing jail time and money as punishment and the deterrent affect is not proportional).<p>So my main point is while I agree that it may be utilitarian to lower the cost to society after the fact there can be even more utility to play the ultimatum game before the event.",1395192451

My favorite language to work in is Perl, which is loaded with all kinds of little context sensitive literals. But Java &quot;the language&quot; is pretty quick to pick up and get working with if you&#x27;re already familiar with another Algol family language, and you can usually read other people&#x27;s code without too much fuss because the language doesn&#x27;t support all sorts of ways of writing something.<p>But on the other hand, you do end up with lots of lines to do something that should be relatively few lines if a more context specific syntax was supported. For example, the last time I worked with Java, code was <i>littered</i> with a half dozen lines of Iterator mess every time you wanted to go through some collection, the new for syntax is very very nice...but there&#x27;s still little hard corners it&#x27;s not that well supported in, like maps, because the underlying structure of the map means I have to build some temporary object to handle an item on the map in the loop...even though the map collection I&#x27;m using is in the standard library and <i>should</i> be part of the language via some syntactic sugar.<p>I&#x27;m still stunned that operator overloading isn&#x27;t supported, I have a few use-cases already where that would be very helpful.",1395191950

7426207,comment,7425303,7425858,1,0,gfodor,,,"This sounds somewhat wrong. Ray tracing is just another term for path tracing, as paths are made up of traced rays. A naive camera-to-light witting ray tracer is still a sampling path tracer but has bias towards a specific subset of paths, namely those which follow specular bounces from the eye to the light or those which have one diffuse bounce.<p>Much of the progress in photorealistic rendering has come from improving the techniques used to sample paths. Bi-directional path tracing samples paths by tracing paths from both the light and the eye and performing a technique called multi-importance sampling in order to weight them appropriately. This allows the algorithm to pick up more light paths that would otherwise be hard to reach, such as those which form caustic reflections.<p>One of the more recent developments on this front is the use of the &quot;specular manifold&quot;, which allows a path sampler to &quot;walk&quot; in path-space that allows capturing of even more partially-specular paths. (See Wenzel 2013.) This technique allows efficient sampling of the main light transport paths in scenes where a specular transparent surface surrounds a light source, ex a light bulb casing.<p>Edit: for this specific hardware, it sounds like they are using a hybrid approach so may very well be doing a basic eye-to-light ray tracing algorithm and then using raster for diffuse surface shading.",1395191335

Some notes:<p>- A MySQL backend should be very fast, but scaling it into multiple shards will have to be an exercise for the user.  Perhaps CitusDB (PostgreSQL compatible) could be useful here.<p>- Metrics cannot be tagged.  This will make it useless for any sort of rollups or breakdowns (&quot;give me the sum of requests over my servers in the XYZ data center&quot;; &quot;give me the requests for each server in the XYZ data center by hostname&quot;).<p>The second issue in particular needs attention before it can complete with enterprise-grade metrics solutions such as Datadog.",1395190940

But, to me, the beauty of this technique goes beyond the effects you can achieve: it&#x27;s an incredibly compact, uniform way of simulating light. Compared to rasterization, which to get the same result, you need a enormous code base that deals with very effect with caution. Adding a reflection in a rasterized scene might not reflect your shadows, etc. You need care about every possible interaction between every effect.",1395190801

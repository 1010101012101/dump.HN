The biggest problem I see so far is the fact that I need to click on a link after hitting search in order to get any results is a big problem. This needs to be fixed first.<p>I'm not completely sure what your direction is. If I search for something my goal is to either A) find the best results, or B) explore. You do somewhat of a mix of these two, but don't do either of these things well. I think you need to figure out what exactly is the utility for your users that you're providing, and then polish it until it's perfect. Going through all sources in a frame easily is kind of interesting, but it's not quite the utility I'm ever looking for. Perhaps merge the results somehow? Or let people explore (similar to Scoopler)?<p>The search space today is different from what it was two years ago. If you consider purely quality of the web results, Google isn't a clear winner. While I wouldn't try something new two years ago (Google was perfect), I would now. If someone built something that genuinely gave me better results, or indexed more stuff, or let me browse content in some great way, or <i>something</i>, I'd use it over Google. I'd imagine other people would too. What I mean is - I don't know what the answer is, but I know it's there, waiting to be discovered. What you've done is unpolished and isn't very useful, but somewhat interesting, so the person who'll discover the answer might as well be you! I'd keep trying, and keep asking for feedback. I'd love to see this go in a good direction.<p>Good luck!",1264902467

It's good to have supportive people around you when you attempt something like this, and it also helps to have an old guitar push button wired up to your reset switch until you get it booting properly. You'll be resetting your machine lots of times.<p>I used the minix filesystem because it was very simple and I could fit the code to load the configuration and boot files in to a small boot loader.<p>I used an old 16 bit compiler for that part, PCs do not generally boot up in 'protected mode', so your first stage is spent on moving stuff from one side of the line to the other, then finally make the switch and continue from there.<p>The stages, iirc were:<p><pre><code>  - master boot loader
 
  - partition boot loader

  - file system boot loader (16 bit)

  - system tasks (fs, idle, task (the scheduler) and a console driver running a shell)
</code></pre>
Because the OS used message passing it was relatively easy to build and test the bits outside of the working os, after all as long as the messages were having the desired side-effects it was all good.<p>I used borland turboc for the 16 bit file system aware boot loader, and DJGPP for the boot strapping to a self-contained os. As soon as that worked and I was able to get GCC running on the other side I focused on recompiling everything from scratch until the binaries matched exactly with the ones I had been making in cross development mode, after that things went a lot faster.<p>That first stage took several months, I don't remember cursing so much in my whole life.<p>I wouldn't trade that time for anything though, it was better than any other programming experience before or after.<p>The OS I wrote was a functional equivalent of QnX, at the time only available for the 286, and I very much wanted a 386 version.<p>Several others had a hand in there, Marcel Wouters completely re-wrote the console driver, and a large part of the window manager was based on a list package that was written by another friend.<p>For networking I used the ne2000 driver from the freebsd project with a bunch of tweaks to get it to work as a user process.<p>The hardest part of the whole thing was to get a hard-realtime response on interrupts in user processes.",1264902294

Their main dilemma is ensuring that sales of their tools does not drop, and instead continues to increase. One tactic I think they should pursue, is to make sure their developer tools can export to formats that consumer devices do support. If I were Adobe I would aggressively be pursuing a single checkbox build option for Flash projects to be exported to HTML5/JS/CSS not unlike how Apple implemented universal binaries. That would leapfrog them so far ahead of the competition that are stuck with more primitive tools to accomplish the same job that there would still be value in buying their tools.",1264900980

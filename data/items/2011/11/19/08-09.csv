3254948,comment,3253120,3254002,1,0,saurik,,,"Yes: something like Google Music is currently much better implemented as a native application; the browser support for audio interfaces, particularly in mobile browsers, is very poor. Meanwhile, the UI you want is often very custom for a music player: small, dense, and omnipresent.<p>However, the NYT example is really poor: the quality difference between an HTML5 offline application and a native application, for that specific use case, is going to be very small, if not downright negligible. The specific issues you brought up involving network connectivity aren't even true.<p>With the HTML5 offline application cache, all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, will be cached locally, atomically stored and updated in MobileSafari's WebApp cache; you can therefore go to the website, even without any Internet access, and still get the site. If it is implemented well, you will also be able to browse previously downloaded news, which could be stored in HTML5 localStorage or Web SQL.<p>Finally, due to proxy server limitations, it isn't like the native alternative will be doing anything different than the web application with respect to ""pull[ing] down"" ""more efficient data"": both are going to be using HTTP requests, which will have identical overhead, and both could download the same data format.<p>So, no: I think you are drastically over-generalizing, and should spend some time looking into the more advanced mechanisms that are now available for developing HTML5-based applications on these devices. You may think you have had bad experiences with web applications, but frankly you probably have only ever used one or two (maybe even zero) HTML5 offline applications (they are fairly rare).",1321692916
3254947,comment,3252582,3253971,1,0,smokinn,,,"Timeouts probably.<p>If you mean why is it a problem at all, it's usually because of database size. On any large scale deployment (ie you have at least a million users) schema modifications will take <i>hours</i>. The only way to do reliable schema modifications is to have extra capacity and do it in stages. Also, your forward changes have to be backwards compatible. (AKA you're not allowed to both add and remove a column at the same time.)<p>The way to do it is to take some of your slaves out of the request pool and run the alter tables on them. You do this many times depending on your available capacity. (You probably can't just rip out half your slaves, you probably need to do at least 3 batches.) After you've altered all your slaves you can promote one to master and take the master offline to do its own alter. Then you push the code changes to production and add the old master back into the pool as a slave once it's done its alter.<p>In this scenario you need 3x the time the alter takes. So if the alter takes 6-7 hours (common in mysql if you have a large-ish table) it's going to take you at least 18 hours before you can push your code that depends on a database change.<p>Doing this manually at scale instead of an automated deployment process is extremely risky and will almost certainly be screwed up often.<p>This is one of the main reasons people are hoping schemaless databases work out in practice.",1321692774

3254938,comment,3252178,3252178,1,0,meric,,,"Barnes & Noble see moving into the tech industry as the next move for the company, but because, as a company rooted in the business of physical books, they lack a patent ""moat"" to protect themselves against other big tech companies. It will be difficult for B&N to produce anything but low margin commodity devices. Any differentiation from other devices will eventually drag B&N into a patent battle. Their (possibly) declining physical book business would make it hard to purchase a portfolio from a dying tech company.<p>One day, here comes Microsoft demanding from B&N a license fee per device for some obvious patents. Since B&N is building a platform that sell high margin products (e-books), the license fee is likely to be affordable....at least until Amazon comes along with patents for a ""online bookstore""... Yet... What a perfect opportunity to rack up a storm, raising awareness of the ridiculous patents owned by existing companies!<p>It is in B&N's interest to devalue existing patent portfolios of their current and future competitors in the tech industry, and they are trying to do exactly that. Even if the plan fails and politicians are unmoved, future tech companies may think twice before threatening B&N with a patent lawsuit... B&N is actually going to bother to find all the pieces of prior art!<p>We shouldn't be surprised a <i>bookstore</i> is fighting against software patents, because we know an existing technology company, with software patents valued at billions, are definitely not going to do it. It had to be a large company that could afford such a fight but the large company had to not have invested heavily into a technology business. Companies with no stake in a technology business would have no interest in demolishing software patents... unless it is <i>moving</i> into it. What companies making such a move? A company that is facing a fast declining market for its products.[1]<p>Such a company can only be a bookstore. [2]<p>[1] If it wasn't fast declining, they wouldn't be doing anything. Imagine putting a frog in a slow cooker, compared to putting a frog in boiling water.<p>[2] It could have been a company in the music industry... but I think it might be too late for those guys. All they can do is try to hang on to what they've got.",1321692322
